<div id="readability-page-1" class="page">
<header><p>26 Aug 2025</p></header><p>In 2020, Apple
released the M1 with a custom GPU. We got to work reverse-engineering
the hardware and porting Linux. Today, you can run Linux on a range of
M1 and M2 Macs, with almost all hardware working: wireless, audio, and
full graphics acceleration.</p>
<p>Our story begins in December 2020, when <a href="https://marcan.st/">Hector Martin</a> kicked off <a href="https://asahilinux.org/">Asahi Linux</a>. I was working for <a href="http://collabora.com/">Collabora</a> working on Panfrost, the open
source Mesa3D driver for Arm Mali GPUs. Hector put out a public call for
guidance from upstream open source maintainers, and I bit. I just
intended to give some quick pointers. Instead, I <a href="https://xkcd.com/356/">bought myself a Christmas present</a> and
got to work. In between my university coursework and Collabora work, I
poked at the <a href="https://rosenzweig.io/blog/asahi-gpu-part-1.html">shader
instruction set</a>.</p>
<p>One thing led to another. Within a few weeks, I <a href="https://rosenzweig.io/blog/asahi-gpu-part-2.html">drew a
triangle</a>.</p>
<p>In 3D graphics, once you can draw a triangle, you can do <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKmzEgpEdNw">anything</a>.</p>
<p>Pretty soon, I started work on a <a href="https://rosenzweig.io/blog/asahi-gpu-part-3.html">shader
compiler</a>. After my final exams that semester, I took a few days off
from Collabora to bring up <a href="https://rosenzweig.io/blog/asahi-gpu-part-4.html">an OpenGL
driver</a> capable of spinning gears with my new compiler.</p>
<p>Over the next year, I kept <a href="https://rosenzweig.io/blog/asahi-gpu-part-5.html">reverse-engineering</a>
and improving the driver until <a href="https://rosenzweig.io/blog/asahi-gpu-part-6.html">it could run 3D
games on macOS</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://lina.yt/">Asahi Lina</a> wrote a kernel
driver for the Apple GPU. My userspace OpenGL driver ran on macOS,
leaving her kernel driver as the missing piece for an open source
graphics stack. In December 2022, we <a href="https://rosenzweig.io/blog/asahi-gpu-part-7.html">shipped graphics
acceleration in Asahi Linux</a>.</p>
<p>In January 2023, I started my final semester in my Computer Science
program at the <a href="https://www.utoronto.ca/">University of
Toronto</a>. For years I juggled my courses with my part-time job and my
hobby driver. I faced the same question as my peers: what will I do
after graduation?</p>
<p>Maybe Panfrost? I started reverse-engineering of the Mali Midgard GPU
back in 2017, when I was still in high school. That led to an internship
at Collabora in 2019 once I graduated, turning into my job throughout
four years of university. During that time, Panfrost grew from a kid’s
pet project based on blackbox reverse-engineering, to a professional
driver engineered by a team with Arm’s backing and hardware
documentation. I did what I set out to do, and the project succeeded
beyond my dreams. <a href="https://rosenzweig.io/blog/passing-reins-panfrost.html">It was
time to move on</a>.</p>
<p>What <em>did</em> I want to do next?</p>
<ul>
<li>Finish what I started with the M1. Ship a great driver.</li>
<li>Bring full, conformant OpenGL drivers to the M1. Apple’s drivers are
not conformant, but we should strive for the industry standard.</li>
<li>Bring full, conformant Vulkan to Apple platforms, disproving the
myth that Vulkan isn’t suitable for Apple hardware.</li>
<li>Bring Proton gaming to Asahi Linux. Thanks to Valve’s work for the
Steam Deck, Windows games can run better on Linux than even on Windows.
Why not reap those benefits on the M1?</li>
</ul>
<p>Panfrost was my challenge until we “won”. My next challenge? Gaming
on Linux on M1.</p>
<p>Once I finished my coursework, I started full-time on gaming on
Linux. Within a month, we shipped <a href="https://rosenzweig.io/blog/opengl3-on-asahi-linux.html">OpenGL 3.1
on Asahi Linux</a>. A few weeks later, we passed <a href="https://rosenzweig.io/blog/first-conformant-m1-gpu-driver.html">official
conformance for OpenGL ES 3.1</a>. That put us at feature parity with
Panfrost. I wanted to go further.</p>
<p>OpenGL (ES) 3.2 requires geometry shaders, a legacy feature not
supported by either Arm or Apple hardware. The proprietary OpenGL
drivers emulate geometry shaders with compute, but there was no open
source prior art to borrow. Even though multiple Mesa drivers need
geometry/tessellation emulation, nobody did the work to get there.</p>
<p>My early progress on OpenGL was fast thanks to the mature common code
in Mesa. It was time to pay it forward. Over the rest of the year, I
implemented geometry/tessellation shader emulation. And also the rest of
the owl. In January 2024, I passed conformance for the full <a href="https://rosenzweig.io/blog/conformant-gl46-on-the-m1.html">OpenGL
4.6</a> specification, finishing up OpenGL.</p>
<p>Vulkan wasn’t too bad, either. I polished the OpenGL driver for a few
months, but once I started typing a Vulkan driver, I passed <a href="https://rosenzweig.io/blog/vk13-on-the-m1-in-1-month.html">1.3
conformance</a> in a few weeks.</p>
<p>What remained was wiring up the geometry/tessellation emulation to my
shiny new Vulkan driver, since those are required for Direct3D. Et
voilà, <a href="https://rosenzweig.io/blog/aaa-gaming-on-m1.html">Proton
games</a>.</p>
<p>Along the way, <a href="https://chaos.social/@karolherbst">Karol
Herbst</a> passed OpenCL 3.0 conformance on the M1, running my compiler
atop his “rusticl” frontend.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, when the Vulkan 1.4 specification was published, we were
ready and <a href="https://rosenzweig.io/blog/vulkan-14-sur-asahi-linux.html">shipped
a conformant implementation on the same day</a>.</p>
<p>After that, I implemented sparse texture support, unlocking Direct3D
12 via Proton.</p>
<p>…Now what?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Ship a great driver? <strong>Check</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Conformant OpenGL 4.6, OpenGL ES 3.2, and OpenCL 3.0?
<strong>Check</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Conformant Vulkan 1.4? <strong>Check</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Proton gaming? <strong>Check</strong>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>That’s a wrap.</p>
<p>We’ve succeeded beyond my dreams. The challenges I chased, I have
tackled. The drivers are fully upstream in Mesa. Performance isn’t too
bad. With the Vulkan on Apple myth busted, conformant Vulkan is now
coming to macOS via <a href="https://www.lunarg.com/a-vulkan-on-metal-mesa-3d-graphics-driver/">LunarG’s
KosmicKrisp</a> project building on my work.</p>
<p>Satisfied, I am now stepping away from the Apple ecosystem. My
friends in the Asahi Linux orbit will carry the torch from here. As for
me?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/introduction-to-the-xe-hpg-architecture.html">Onto
the next challenge!</a></p>
<p><a href="https://rosenzweig.io/">Back to home</a></p>

Please sign in or subscribe to access the full content.</span><span id="piano-gate"><p>On August 15, 1977, at the Big Ear radio telescope observatory at Ohio State University, a narrowband radio signal was received. A few days later, astronomer Jerry Ehman reviewed the data and noticed the signal sequence, which lasted for a full 72 seconds. In the margin next to the printout, he simply wrote <a href="https://www.iflscience.com/what-was-the-wow-signal-and-why-is-it-so-famous-74576" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"Wow!"</a>, and thus the puzzling signal had a name that would stick for the next 43 years at least.</p><p>The signal has, so far, defied explanation, and that's not for a lack of trying. Researchers argued the case for it being a <a href="https://www.iflscience.com/the-wow-signal-was-likely-the-radio-emission-of-a-comet-42054" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">comet passing through</a> the area Big Ear was listening to, only for that to be <a href="https://www.iflscience.com/the-wow-signal-sorted-not-so-fast-42099" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">completely refuted</a> about two days later by the team that detected the Wow! signal in the first place, as a comet would have produced a diffuse signal given the large area they cover, rather than the abruptly cut-off signal that was received.</p><p>The signal has been a source of speculation in the "aliens are out there" community, and not without reason. No other signal like it has been detected before or since. It was in a range of frequencies close to the <a href="http://www.setileague.org/askdr/hydrogen.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hydrogen line</a>, which is relatively free from background noise, making it a good range to pick were we to try and <a href="https://www.iflscience.com/if-aliens-really-do-exist-how-can-we-find-them-36181" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">communicate with other civilizations ourselves</a>. On top of that, the team themselves believed it to be a good candidate for extraterrestrial life.</p><p>&nbsp;"The 'Wow!' signal is highly suggestive of extraterrestrial intelligent origin," Ohio State University Radio Observatory director John Kraus wrote in a <a href="https://technosearch.seti.org/sites/default/files/2018-09/WOW%20official.pdf" target="_blank" id="isPasted">letter to Carl Sagan in 1994</a>, "but little more can be said until it returns for further study."</p><p><span contenteditable="false" draggable="true"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r6rPNPVQp0Y?&amp;wmode=opaque&amp;rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""><span class="fr-mk" style="display: none;">&nbsp;</span><span class="fr-mk" style="display: none;">&nbsp;</span><span class="fr-mk" style="display: none;">&nbsp;</span><span class="fr-mk" style="display: none;">&nbsp;</span><span class="fr-mk" style="display: none;">&nbsp;</span></iframe></span></p><p>Since then, the signal has been the subject of many studies, but it has never returned. In a new attempt to narrow down what it might be, a team of scientists re-analyzed decades of data from the Big Ear telescope using modern signal analysis techniques, as well as analyzing data which had previously been unpublished, producing two not as yet peer-reviewed papers on the topic.</p><p>First up, the team found that the signal was very unlikely to have been the result of interference in the telescope itself, or of terrestrial origin. The team found strong statistical evidence that the signal was not the result of radio frequency interference (RFI).</p><p id="isPasted">"If this RFI is persistent, it would take approximately six millennia of uninterrupted observations to achieve a signal analogous to the Wow! Signal from random RFI occurrences," the team explains in paper II.</p><p>Looking at other possible sources, including <a href="https://www.iflscience.com/87-satellites-sent-to-space-in-the-last-24-hours-space-is-becoming-ever-more-crowded-78997" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">satellites</a>, the team found this to be unlikely as well. Most satellites of the time were not in the area of the sky identified by the team, orbiting on different planes. While the team suggested that satellites which have slowly come out of orbit could be a source, or a Soviet satellite occupying this orbit, they believe this is unlikely too. This is because they would spend only a few fractions of a second in front of the telescope, rather than the 72 seconds necessary to replicate the Wow! signal.</p><p>"A continuous signal from an orbiting satellite will need to be at an orbit beyond the Moon to reproduce the pattern," they added.</p><p>So, what is it? While the team don't yet have an answer, they have made a lot of progress, for instance finding that the signal was much more powerful than had previously been predicted at 250 Janskys, four times larger than had previously been estimated.</p><p>“Our results don’t solve the mystery of the Wow! Signal,” lead author Professor Abel Méndez of the Planetary Habitability Laboratory at the University of Puerto Rico at Arecibo, explained in a <a href="https://phl.upr.edu/wow?" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">statement</a>. “But they give us the clearest picture yet of what it was and where it came from. This new precision allows us to target future observations more effectively than ever before.”</p><p>The main clue identified by the team from the "Aricebo Wow" project were two similar signals in 1977 and 1978 (dubbed Wow2 and Wow3) which showed similar characteristics to the original "Wow!" signal, though far less intense. The team believes that the original team studying the Wow! signal were intrigued by these signals as well, looking at their own notes.</p><p id="isPasted">"It is clear that the Ohio SETI team were interested in these signals, as evidenced by their circling. We believe that they recognized these signals as compact cold Hi clouds, after corroborating their appearance in multiple scans," the team write in paper II. "We searched for the coordinates of these signals in the HI4PI survey and confirmed their association with compact Hi clouds."</p><p>For the team, this suggests that the Wow! signal could have a common origin in these cold clouds of hydrogen in the interstellar medium (ISM). In paper I from the Aricebo Wow project, they go further and suggest a possible cause of the signal.</p><p id="isPasted">"We postulate that the Wow! Signal was a superradiance event that produced a maser-like flare from a small cold Hi cloud," the team writes in their study.&nbsp;</p><p>"We observed from the Arecibo Observatory narrowband signals (∆ν ≤ 10 kHz) similar to the Wow! Signal near the hydrogen line, though significantly weaker. These signals are attributed to small cold Hi cloud regions within the galactic ISM. We propose that the Wow! Signal was caused by the abrupt brightening of the hydrogen line of these clouds triggered by an intense radiation source, such as a magnetar flare or a soft gamma repeater," they add.</p><div data-asset-id="86035" data-reactroot=""><div><picture title=""><source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://assets.iflscience.com/assets/articleNo/80561/iImg/86035/hi-cloud-l.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://assets.iflscience.com/assets/articleNo/80561/iImg/86035/hi-cloud-l.png" type="image/png"><source media="(min-width: 600px)" srcset="https://assets.iflscience.com/assets/articleNo/80561/iImg/86035/hi-cloud-m.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width: 600px)" srcset="https://assets.iflscience.com/assets/articleNo/80561/iImg/86035/hi-cloud-m.png" type="image/png"><source media="(max-width: 300px)" srcset="https://assets.iflscience.com/assets/articleNo/80561/iImg/86035/hi-cloud-s.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(max-width: 300px)" srcset="https://assets.iflscience.com/assets/articleNo/80561/iImg/86035/hi-cloud-s.png" type="image/png"><img data-asset-id="86035" src="https://assets.iflscience.com/assets/articleNo/80561/iImg/86035/hi%20cloud.png" alt="Figure explaining how a distant magnetar could excite a cold HI cloud and result in the Wow signal." title="Figure explaining how a distant magnetar could excite a cold HI cloud and result in the Wow signal." loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption><p>One hypothesis for the cause of the signal.</p><p>Image credit: PHL @ UPR Aricebo (Méndez et al., 2024), <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CC BY 4.0</a></p></figcaption></div><p>Though this is an intriguing possibility – and magnetars are often suspected for <a href="https://www.iflscience.com/brightest-fast-radio-burst-yet-discovered-130-million-light-years-away-in-our-cosmic-neighborhood-80516" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">producing weird signals</a> – the team cannot rule out other potential causes in the cosmos.

<p>
More seriously, Artanis is written using GNU Guile, one of the best implementations of Scheme language.
</p>

<p>
One day, the folks at GNU were discussing what language they would write the GNU website in - and many chose Python. But I found that strange, because the official extension language of GNU is GNU Guile. And I wondered aloud - why not start a brand new project to provide a web framework written with GNU Guile? To which RMS said, "It's cool, I like this idea."
</p>

<p>
But at that time, it was just an idea without a plan.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately, a few months later, the Guile community held a hack-potluck to celebrate Guile2 turning two - which is a contest to write a cool program in a few weeks. And so, Artanis was born.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
<p>The BBC <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-48949534" rel="noreferrer">recounts</a> by means of interviews the experience of a few ambassadors in these matters.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I was called by the foreign ministry and was told 'We need to see you immediately,'" Mr Casson [former UK ambassador to Egypt] tells the BBC. "The first thing they said was, 'We are not summoning you, but we are going to tell the press we are summoning you. If it had been a summoning, we would have sent a formal diplomatic note summoning you.'"</p>
<p>This is the way things normally work in a summoning - a formal, polite, diplomatic note is sent to the relevant country's embassy asking - but not really demanding - its representative to attend a meeting at the foreign ministry, or its equivalent. The medium of the summoning is the message, Mr Casson says.</p>
<p><strong>"The main thing is that it is a piece of diplomatic theatre and everybody understands their role, and acts their role,"</strong> Mr Casson, who was in Cairo between 2014 and 2018, says. <strong>In London, the drama can involve being made to wait in the grand surroundings of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, to understand the seriousness of the occasion.</strong></p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>Mr Fujisaki, a former Japanese ambassador to the United Nations, also served as its representative in Washington between 2008 and 2012. In December 2009, he was summoned by US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. This was notable for two reasons: this is not something the US state department does often, and Japan is a close ally of the US, so an unlikely subject of a summoning. The Washington Post reports Mrs Clinton was "blunt, if diplomatic" with Mr Fujisaki.</p>
<p>[...] Although Mr Fujisaki was widely reported to have been summoned, he disputes the use of the word - and says no-one in the diplomatic service uses it. "A summoning sounds like you are obligated to be there, it's more legal," he says. "In this case, the government is asking you to be there, it's a request."</p>
<p>Mr Fujisaki says the ambassador must speak to his home government so that they do not learn of the summoning through the media. <strong>The home government would then brief the ambassador on the most appropriate way to respond and what points they should make.</strong></p>
<p>Ambassadors can be summoned in inconvenient circumstances - as when Israel's foreign ministry called on 12 countries' representatives on 25 December 2016, when many were away for Christmas. So was making Mr Fujisaki travel across a city in a snowstorm a way of inconveniencing him, and reinforcing the state department's unhappiness? He says not.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>Mr Bocka, the Albanian ambassador in Belgrade since 2014, is in an unusual position: he once refused a summoning by his host country. Four months into his ambassadorship, Albania's football team travelled to Serbia for a Euro 2016 qualifying match. About 40 minutes in, the match was stopped when a drone flew overhead carrying an Albanian nationalist flag.</p>
<p>A brawl broke out, and the match was abandoned. Soon afterwards, Mr Bocka received a demarche from Serbia's foreign ministry - a polite request for him to attend, rather than an order.</p>
<p>"This is the most common way diplomacy is done," Mr Bocka tells the BBC. <strong>"You are asked to go, normally to the director, and you have to hear what they have to say, and at the same time, you have the right to express your position."</strong></p>
<p>A year later, it was a different story. Before the return match in Albania's capital Tirana, the Serbian team bus was pelted with stones and a window was cracked. Cue the summoning, and a cranking-up of diplomatic pressure.</p>
<p>"They asked me to go immediately to the foreign affairs ministry but I said no," Mr Bocka says. He did not feel the stoning of a bus merited his summoning. "I knew what had happened: nothing! It was 22:00, I said 'maybe tomorrow', but they wanted to have this story on the TV, so I said 'No, I'm not coming'. I told them I wouldn't play this game."</p>
<p>Mr Bocka acknowledges how rare it is for an ambassador to reject a summoning by his host country, and the refusal was not without consequences. For several months afterwards, he was disinvited from foreign affairs ministry events, even while his staff continued to work unhindered. But he stayed in his job, and four years later, is on good terms with his hosts again. "Our relations were damaged for a moment," he says. "But now? It's OK."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>TLDR: it's usually a fairly polite affair, but it can involve inconveniencing the ambassador on purpose.</p>
<p>Of course, if the ambassador turns out too unpleasant in the judgement of the host, they <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/23/south-african-ambassador-expelled-from-us-welcomed-home-by-supporters" rel="noreferrer">can be</a> declared persona non-grata and get expelled etc. Although that tends to happen more because of statements to the press, or other <a href="https://nzhistory.govt.nz/page/soviet-ambassador-expelled" rel="noreferrer">deeds</a>, rather than direct exchanges, IIRC. (And of course, if war breaks out or just relations get really bad short of war, the same <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2012/05/29/so-how-do-you-expel-an-ambassador-anyway/" rel="noreferrer">can happen</a> even if no breaches of protocol occur.)</p>
<hr>
<p>Or if you prefer a more summarizing (but less exemplifying) <a href="https://gpil.jura.uni-bonn.de/2023/03/summoning-an-ambassador-a-piece-of-diplomatic-theatre/" rel="noreferrer">take</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The ‘summoning’ of an ambassador is an age-old diplomatic tool. It means that the receiving State sends a note verbale to the relevant country’s embassy requesting the ambassador to attend a meeting at the foreign ministry usually to express displeasure over actions or a policy of the sending State. <strong>The modality of the meeting may vary. It has been said that ‘sometimes it can be a casual conversation in comfortable chairs. Other times, a formal encounter across a table. If the row is serious, it can even be what’s called “a meeting without coffee” when chairs are removed from the room, the ambassador is forced to remain standing, and a formal diplomatic reprimand is read out and handed over in text form, known in the trade as a “note verbale”.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interestingly perhaps, in German practice, with whom the ambassador is summoned or invited to speak to, depends on the 'severity' of the matter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In German practice, there are various degrees of summoning. At its most mild, the ambassador is requested to attend a meeting with the director or a representative of the relevant department in the Federal Foreign Office. To escalate things, the conversation is conducted by a State Secretary. If things are really serious, the ambassador may be hauled before the Federal Foreign Minister. For example, in October 2013, Federal Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle summoned the US ambassador to Germany over allegations that the United States has been tapping Chancellor Angela Merkel’s mobile phone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A related <a href="https://gpil.jura.uni-bonn.de/2020/07/summoning-or-inviting-an-ambassador-is-there-a-difference/" rel="noreferrer">piece</a> in the same venue adds a few more details (mostly) about the German practice:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations does not contain any provisions on the summoning of ambassador. Summons is, however, a well-established practice of diplomatic relations. [...]</p>
<p>Heads of mission are, as a rule, summoned to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and not to other government departments, the chancellery, or prime minister’s office. Heads of mission are usually summoned at the behest of the Foreign Minister of the receiving State. In terms of diplomatic protocol, summons are extended by Deputy Foreign Ministers, State Secretaries, and the directors of Foreign Ministry departments. Being summoned is part of the functions of the head of a diplomatic mission. However, it is the sovereign decision of the sending State how the functions of a head of mission are exercised. There is no obligation under international law to comply with a summons, but failure to do so may prompt the receiving State to declare the head of mission <em>persona non grata</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And, <strong>often enough, a public statement is then made as to what happened</strong>, e.g.:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On 28 May 2020, a Federal Foreign Office spokesperson issued a statement which read in part:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“State Secretary of the Federal Foreign Office Miguel Berger invited Sergey J. Nechajev, the Ambassador of the Russian Federation, to the Federal Foreign Office for talks today. On behalf of the Federal Government, Mr Berger condemned the hacker attack on the German Bundestag in the strongest possible terms.</p>
<p>The Russian Ambassador was informed, with reference to the arrest warrant issued by the Investigating Magistrate of the Federal Court of Justice at the request of the Federal Public Prosecutor’s Office on 29 April 2020 against Russian national Dmitri Badin, that the Federal Government will call in Brussels for the EU’s cyber sanctions regime to be invoked with respect to those responsible for the attack on the German Bundestag, including Mr Badin. […]</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm not sure if the German side (officially) publicized anything of the Russian response, or if they usually just use the occasion to [re]state their own position. Anyhow, the mass media will probably report what the other side said.</p>
<hr>
<p>Another <a href="https://meduza.io/en/feature/2021/04/16/a-common-practice" rel="noreferrer">piece</a> about how these things were handled in Russia (in 2021):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The American ambassador being summoned to our MID [the Russian Foreign Affairs Ministry] is a common practice. They summon him for consultations, to clarify some positions that are being expressed by his country’s leadership. [...]</p>
<p>It would be more appropriate to say invited than “summoned.” The process goes something like this: a document requesting a visit from the ambassador is sent from the MID to the embassy. The time is agreed upon through the usual channel, based on the MID’s schedule and the ambassador’s schedule. [...]</p>
<p><strong>[During the meeting], the MID will ask the ambassador clarifying questions, however, he isn’t obliged to answer everything immediately. If any questions are uncomfortable for him for whatever reason, no one will grill him — they simply have no right to interrogate him. He can take a time-out and consult with the central apparatus — in [the U.S.’s] case, the State Department. If he doesn’t want to answer the question directly, he’ll give a vague response.</strong></p>
<p>[...] Previously, there were instances where they asked the ambassador an uncomfortable question and he avoided answering it by saying “I need to think” [or] “I’m not prepared to answer,” or he hit back with platitudes. A relatively new trend in international communications is that everything is said directly.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>A 2010 FP <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2010/02/22/what-happens-when-ambassadors-get-summoned/" rel="noreferrer">piece</a> summarizing in the abstract, but I get the impression based on mostly how China, the USSR, and <em>perhaps</em> the US dealt with these:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These summonses tend to be highly choreographed affairs. Imagine that one country — say, China — is angry at the United States for selling arms to, say, Taiwan. China’s foreign minister decides to summon the U.S. envoy in Beijing, releasing a statement detailing why the sale is unacceptable. <strong>When the ambassador shows up at the Foreign Ministry, a delegation of Chinese officials meets him and explains the country’s grievances, reading from a prepared statement. Then, the U.S. ambassador responds by stating his government’s views. Depending on the circumstance, he might apologize, request further dialogue on the issue, or even reject China’s position outright.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Stagecraft is paramount. Generally, a summons will include two to four diplomats on either side. But if an ambassador comes in to meet with a cabinet minister or a massive delegation, she knows she is in real diplomatic hot water. Ministries also carefully engineer the tone of the meeting, from the conciliatory to the very frosty. They decide how strong to make the language they use with the ambassador — sometimes, even, using condescending or discourteous terms. In a rancorous summons in a French-speaking country, for instance, a diplomat might use the "tu" rather than the "vous" form of address as a not-so-subtle slight. (Such lack of decorum, though, is very rare.) Responding ambassadors — who are coached on how best to respond to summonses by their foreign ministries and embassy staff — engineer careful responses in turn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Soviet Union was notorious for its chilly meetings — literally. U.S. Embassy staffers would show up to find themselves facing a contingent of unsmiling diplomatic officials in a freezing-cold room.</strong> Of course, relations between Washington and Moscow weren’t so good back then — and the warmth of the relationship between two countries determines how often, if ever, an ambassador is summoned. (The U.S. ambassador to Switzerland virtually never gets summoned.)</p>
<p>The U.S. State Department tends to use summons very sparingly — only to telegraph high-level diplomatic concern. [...]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alas the rest of the last para just exemplifies what counts as such concern in the US, but details nothing of the US protocol otherwise.
(And according the "thanks" note at the end of that article, it's written based on the experiences of "several former ambassadors", which I'm guessing mostly means US ambassadors, since they also thank the US State Department for helping write the piece.)</p>

Just as people encounter phishing attempts in their inboxes, browser-using AIs face prompt injection attacks—where malicious actors hide instructions in websites, emails, or documents to trick AIs into harmful actions without users' knowledge (like hidden text saying "disregard previous instructions and do [malicious action] instead").</p><p>Prompt injection attacks can cause AIs to delete files, steal data, or make financial transactions. This isn't speculation: we’ve run “red-teaming” experiments to test Claude for Chrome and, without mitigations, we’ve found some concerning results.</p><p>We conducted extensive adversarial prompt injection testing, evaluating 123 test cases representing 29 different attack scenarios. Browser use without our safety mitigations showed a 23.6% attack success rate when deliberately targeted by malicious actors.</p><p>One example of a successful attack—before our new defenses were applied—was a malicious email claiming that, for security reasons, emails needed to be deleted.

First, we’ve improved our system prompts—the general instructions Claude receives before specific instructions from users—to direct Claude on how to handle sensitive data and respond to requests to take sensitive actions.</p><p>Additionally, we’ve blocked Claude from using websites from certain high-risk categories such as financial services, adult content, and pirated content. And we’ve begun to build and test advanced classifiers to detect suspicious instruction patterns and unusual data access requests—even when they arise in seemingly legitimate contexts.</p><p>When we added safety mitigations to autonomous mode, we reduced the attack success rate of 23.6% to 11.2%, which represents a meaningful improvement over our existing Computer Use capability (where Claude could see the user’s screen but without the browser interface that we’re introducing today).</p><div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="3840" height="2160" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2Fb88d1e1c0c196dd012a7d44c5ae8d255d8a20822-3840x2160.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2Fb88d1e1c0c196dd012a7d44c5ae8d255d8a20822-3840x2160.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"><figcaption><em>Prompt injection attack success rates across three scenarios: our older computer use capability, our new browser use product with only previous safety mitigations, and our new browser use product with new mitigations (lower scores are better).

On a “challenge” set of four browser-specific attack types, our new mitigations were able to reduce attack success rate from 35.7% to 0%.</p><p>Before we make Claude for Chrome more widely available, we want to expand the universe of attacks we’re thinking about and learn how to get these percentages much closer to zero, by understanding more about the current threats as well as those that might appear in the future.</p><h2 id="taking-part">Taking part</h2><p>Internal testing can’t replicate the full complexity of how people browse in the real world: the specific requests they make, the websites they visit, and how malicious content appears in practice. New forms of prompt injection attacks are also constantly being developed by malicious actors. This research preview allows us to partner with trusted users in authentic conditions, revealing which of our current protections work, and which need work.</p><p>We'll use insights from the pilot to refine our prompt injection classifiers and our underlying models. By uncovering real-world examples of unsafe behavior and new attack patterns that aren’t present in controlled tests, we’ll teach our models to recognize the attacks and account for the related behaviors, and ensure that safety classifiers will pick up anything that the model itself misses.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-body-8645973081022379120" itemprop="description articleBody">
<p>I was reading the latest issue of the journal <em>Science</em>, and a paper mentioned the compound Cr<sub>2</sub>Gr<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>6</sub>.
For a moment, I thought my knowledge of the periodic table was slipping, since I couldn't remember the element Gr.
It turns out that <em>Gr</em> was supposed to be <em>Ge</em>, germanium, but that raises two issues.
First, shouldn't the peer reviewers and proofreaders at a top journal catch this error?
But more curiously, it appears that this formula is a mistake that has been copied around several times.</p>
<p>The <em>Science</em> paper [1] states, "Intrinsic ferromagnetism in these materials was discovered in Cr<sub>2</sub>Gr<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>6</sub> and CrI<sub>3</sub> down to the bilayer and monolayer thickness limit in 2017."
I checked the referenced paper [2] and verified that the correct compound is Cr<sub>2</sub><strong>Ge</strong><sub>2</sub>Te<sub>6</sub>, with Ge for germanium.</p>
<p>But in the process, I found more publications that <em>specifically</em> mention the 2017 discovery of intrinsic ferromagnetism in both Cr<sub>2</sub>Gr<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>6</sub> and CrI<sub>3</sub>.
A 2021 paper in <em>Nanoscale</em> [3] says,
"Since the discovery of intrinsic ferromagnetism in atomically thin Cr<sub>2</sub>Gr<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>6</sub> and CrI<sub>3</sub> in 2017, research on two-dimensional (2D) magnetic materials has become a highlighted topic."
Then, a 2023 book chaper [4] opens with the abstract: "Since the discovery of intrinsic long-range magnetic order in two-dimensional (2D) layered magnets, e.g., Cr<sub>2</sub>Gr<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>6</sub> and CrI<sub>3</sub> in 2017, [...]"</p>
<p>This illustrates how easy it is for a random phrase to get copied around with nobody checking it.
(Earlier, I found a <a href="https://www.righto.com/2019/10/how-special-register-groups-invaded.html">bogus computer definition</a> that has persisted for over 50 years.)
To be sure, these could all be independent typos—it's an easy typo to make since G<strong>e</strong> and G<strong>r</strong> are neighbors on the keyboard and Cr2Gr2 scans better than Cr2Ge2.
A few other papers [5, 6, 7] have the same typo, but in different contexts.
My bigger concern is that once AI picks up the erroneous formula,
it will propagate as misinformation forever.
I hope that by calling out this error, I can bring an end to it.

					<p>The Michigan Supreme Court has drawn a firm line around digital privacy, ruling that police cannot use overly broad warrants to comb through every corner of a person’s phone.</p>
<p>In People v. Carson, the court found that warrants for digital devices must include specific limitations, allowing access only to information directly tied to the suspected crime.</p>
<p><strong>We obtained a copy of the opinion for you <a href="https://docs.reclaimthenet.org/people-v-carson-michigan-supreme-court-166923-202.pdf">here</a> (the opinion starts on page 5).</strong></p>
<p>Michael Carson became the focus of a theft investigation involving money allegedly taken from a neighbor’s safe.</p>
<p>Authorities secured a warrant to search his phone, but the document placed no boundaries on what could be examined.</p>
<p>It permitted access to all data on the device, including messages, photos, contacts, and documents, without any restriction based on time period or relevance. Investigators collected over a thousand pages of information, much of it unrelated to the accusation.</p>
<p>The court ruled that this kind of expansive warrant violates the Fourth Amendment, which requires particularity in describing what police may search and seize.</p>
<p>The justices said allowing law enforcement to browse through an entire phone without justification amounts to an unconstitutional exploratory search.</p>
<p>Smartphones now serve as central hubs for people’s lives, containing everything from health records and banking details to travel histories and intimate conversations.</p>
<p>Searching a device without limits can expose a volume and variety of personal information that far exceeds what a physical search could reveal.</p>
<p>Groups including the Electronic Frontier Foundation, ACLU National, and the ACLU of Michigan intervened in the case, filing a brief that called on the court to adopt strict rules for digital searches.</p>
<p>They argued that phones hold what the US Supreme Court has described as “the sum of an individual’s private life,” and that unrestricted warrants effectively strip away meaningful privacy protections.</p>
<p><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a href="https://reclaimthenet.org/your-phone-isnt-safe-at-the-border">Your Phone Isn’t Safe at the Border. Warrantless Phone Searches Hit Record High.</a></strong></p>
<p>A four-justice majority agreed. They emphasized that digital search warrants must be precise, listing exactly what investigators are seeking and explaining why those specific data types or timeframes are relevant. Magistrates authorizing such searches must confirm that police have a factual basis for requesting that access.</p>

<p>Starting August 29th, new regulations have come into effect. Both DHL and UPS currently have no working solution, so on their advice, we are temporarily suspending all shipments to the USA effective immediately.</p>



<p>The issue is that we are now required to collect all taxes and tariffs on U.S. shipments in advance. However, there is no functioning calculator for this, which has created chaos. Parcels are being held in customs for weeks due to unreasonable requirements. For example, importers must declare the exact amount of steel, copper, and aluminum in products, with a 100% tariff applied to these materials. This makes little sense—PCBs, for instance, contain copper traces, but the quantity is nearly impossible to estimate.</p>



<p>U.S. customs is demanding a <em>Certificate of Analysis</em> (which could cost thousands of dollars and to determine what exact amount of Aluminum, Copper and Steel are in the product), otherwise they assume the entire PCB consists of copper, aluminum, and steel, and charge a 100% tariff on the whole product. This is a prime example of unnecessary complexity in international trade.</p>



<p>We sincerely apologize to all U.S. customers wishing to order directly. For now, please purchase our products through Mouser or Digi-Key.</p>



<p>All pending orders will be reviewed one by one and discussed with our customers, to decide what to do in each case.</p>

Could it be all the roles he was submitting to weren't actually real?</p><p>Ghost jobs refer to a practice where businesses post an opening without a specific intent to hire from the ad. Companies have different reasons for doing this, like if they're constantly hiring to fill multiple vacancies with that title, to collect and store resumes for a future need, or to signal to investors that they're growing faster than they really are.</p><p>Some 17% of all job posts on Greenhouse in the second quarter of 2025 were for roles the business never intended to actually fill, according to data provided to CNBC Make It.</p></div><h2><a id="headline0"></a>A federal proposal to ban ghost jobs</h2><div><p>For job seekers, it all boils down to being a time-consuming headache.</p><p>"There's nothing illegal about posting a job, currently, and never filling it," says Thompson, a network engineering leader in Warrenton, Virginia. Not to mention, it's "really hard to prove, and so that's one of the reasons that legally, it's been kind of this gray area."</p><p>As Thompson researched more into the phenomenon, he connected with former colleagues and professional connections across the country experiencing the same thing. Together, the eight of them decided to form the TJAAA working group to spearhead efforts for federal legislation to officially ban businesses from posting ghost jobs.</p><p>In May, the group drafted <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/685ab78e659296152e481c18/t/685b5a8d7d9e787cca155924/1750817421458/TJAA+-+Full+Act.pdf" target="_blank">its first proposal</a>: The TJAAA aims to require that all public job listings include information such as:</p><ul><li>The intended hire and start dates</li><li>Whether it's a new role or backfill</li><li>If it's being offered internally with preference to current employees</li><li>The number of times the position has been posted in the last two years, and other factors, according to the draft language.</li></ul></div><blockquote data-test="Pullquote"><div><p>It's a problem a lot of people know about.

So far, he says he's had close to 30 meetings with Congressional staffers working with elected officials on both sides of the aisle.</p><p>"We have had a lot of people say, 'We would support this if it came to the floor. However, we are too busy right now to make this a priority,'" Thompson says.</p></div><div id="ArticleBody-InlineImage-108188805" data-test="InlineImage"><p>Eric Thompson is the founding member of the Truth in Job Advertising and Accountability Act working group.</p><p>Courtesy of subject</p></div><div><p>Thompson says he and his TJAAA advocates are now focused on "driving that grassroots campaign to get people to make it a priority for their legislators to sponsor it to come to the floor."</p><p>Thompson's work is part of a growing movement to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/07/lawmakers-want-to-end-to-hr-ghosting-during-the-interview-processheres-how.html">crack down</a> on ghost jobs.</p><p>As of Jan. 1, 2026 some companies in Ontario, Canada,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/00e41#BK19" target="_blank">will be subject to new laws </a>requiring them to inform job applicants about the status of their candidacy in a timely fashion (essentially banning HR ghosting in the interview process) and also seeks to eliminate the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/19/hiring-platforms-are-making-it-harder-to-find-a-job-says-hr-tech-founder.html">posting of ghost jobs</a>.</p><p>In the U.S., state lawmakers in New Jersey, Kentucky and California have <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-31/the-era-of-ghosting-job-candidates-is-slowly-ending" target="_blank">their own proposals</a> to prevent HR ghosting and ghost job ads, and to promote transparency in the hiring process.</p><p>For now, Thompson's advocacy efforts go toward learning what he can about the legislative process and encouraging job-seekers to speak up about their experiences.

<div>
<p id="speakable-summary">Andreessen Horowitz and OpenAI President Greg Brockman are among the Silicon Valley veterans putting more than $100 million into a network of political action committees (PACs) that will advocate against strict AI regulations in next year’s midterm elections, reports <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/silicon-valley-launches-pro-ai-pacs-to-defend-industry-in-midterm-elections-287905b3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Wall Street Journal</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The new pro-AI super-PAC network dubbed “Leading the Future” aims to use campaign donations and digital ads to advocate for favorable AI regulation and oppose candidates that the group thinks will stifle the industry.</p>







<p>Both Andreessen Horowitz and OpenAI were part of a push earlier this year to implement a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/30/congress-might-block-state-ai-laws-for-five-years-heres-what-it-means/">10-year moratorium</a> on states’ rights to create their own AI regulations. The ban was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/01/us-senate-removes-controversial-ai-moratorium-from-budget-bill/">ultimately struck down</a>, but the AI industry continues to fight against a “patchwork of regulations,” which they say would slow down innovation and put the U.S. at risk of losing the AI race to China.</p>

<p>The group hopes to model its approach on pro-crypto super-PAC network Fairshake, which helped cement a victory for Donald Trump. It will generally align with the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/23/trumps-ai-strategy-trades-guardrails-for-growth-in-race-against-china/">policies of White House</a> AI and crypto czar David Sacks, per The Journal.&nbsp;</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>On a quiet patch of former farmland in northeastern Louisiana, a fleet of excavators has leveled more than 2,000 acres of reddish clay earth. This is rural Richland Parish, once a floodplain tangled with meandering bayous and wild canebrake where black bears still wander and a quarter of the 20,000 residents live below the poverty line.</p><div>



<p>Enter Meta—the sixth-largest company in the world by market cap. The tech giant is keen on making Richland home to its wildest AI aspirations—<a href="https://fortune.com/2025/02/20/entergy-ceo-interview-10-billion-meta-data-center-louisiana-ai-utility-gold-rush/?utm_source=search&amp;utm_medium=suggested_search&amp;utm_campaign=search_link_clicks" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2025/02/20/entergy-ceo-interview-10-billion-meta-data-center-louisiana-ai-utility-gold-rush/?utm_source=search&amp;utm_medium=suggested_search&amp;utm_campaign=search_link_clicks" data-type="link" data-id="https://fortune.com/2025/02/20/entergy-ceo-interview-10-billion-meta-data-center-louisiana-ai-utility-gold-rush/?utm_source=search&amp;utm_medium=suggested_search&amp;utm_campaign=search_link_clicks">courtesy of a tremendous amount</a> of new gas-fired power. The region has ample land and sits adjacent to Louisiana’s huge Haynesville Shale gas field.



</p><p>In December, construction began on Meta’s biggest-yet data center: a $10 billion complex of nine buildings, housing bank upon bank of servers that will take up over 4 million square feet, an area larger than Disneyland.



</p><p>Meta chairman and CEO Mark Zuckerberg isn’t stopping there. He dubbed the project “Hyperion” in July—a data center “supercluster” that eventually could use the energy equivalent of 4 million homes and become the world’s biggest data center project. Zuckerberg said Hyperion would cover a “significant part of the footprint of Manhattan.”



</p><p>The project entails more than 2 gigawatts of computing capacity—Zuckerberg said it could eventually expand to 5 gigawatts—programmed to train open-source large language models. Meta lagged in the AI race with previous flops and the multibillion-dollar “Metaverse” boondoggle. Now he’s framing Hyperion and his <a href="https://fortune.com/2025/08/20/meta-ai-race-superintelligence-investors-billions-in-ad-revenue/?utm_source=search&amp;utm_medium=suggested_search&amp;utm_campaign=search_link_clicks" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2025/08/20/meta-ai-race-superintelligence-investors-billions-in-ad-revenue/?utm_source=search&amp;utm_medium=suggested_search&amp;utm_campaign=search_link_clicks">construction spree as the pursuit</a> of “superintelligence,” while <a href="https://fortune.com/article/alexandr-wang-meta-scale-ai-entrepreneur-mark-zuckerberg/?utm_source=search&amp;utm_medium=suggested_search&amp;utm_campaign=search_link_clicks" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/article/alexandr-wang-meta-scale-ai-entrepreneur-mark-zuckerberg/?utm_source=search&amp;utm_medium=suggested_search&amp;utm_campaign=search_link_clicks" data-type="link" data-id="https://fortune.com/article/alexandr-wang-meta-scale-ai-entrepreneur-mark-zuckerberg/?utm_source=search&amp;utm_medium=suggested_search&amp;utm_campaign=search_link_clicks">poaching AI talent using $250 million pay packages</a> and <a href="https://fortune.com/2025/06/22/inside-rise-scale-alexandr-wang-meta-zuckerberg-14-billion-deal-acquihire-ai-supremacy-race/?utm_source=search&amp;utm_medium=suggested_search&amp;utm_campaign=search_link_clicks" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2025/06/22/inside-rise-scale-alexandr-wang-meta-zuckerberg-14-billion-deal-acquihire-ai-supremacy-race/?utm_source=search&amp;utm_medium=suggested_search&amp;utm_campaign=search_link_clicks" data-type="link" data-id="https://fortune.com/2025/06/22/inside-rise-scale-alexandr-wang-meta-zuckerberg-14-billion-deal-acquihire-ai-supremacy-race/?utm_source=search&amp;utm_medium=suggested_search&amp;utm_campaign=search_link_clicks">buying a 49% stake in</a> Scale AI.</p><p>It’s the latest in a grandiose game of Big Tech one-upmanship in AI, competing with the likes of <a href="https://fortune.com/company/alphabet/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/alphabet/">Google</a>, <a href="https://fortune.com/company/microsoft/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/microsoft/">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://fortune.com/company/amazon-com/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/amazon-com/">Amazon</a>, and OpenAI.



</p><p>“We are making all these investments because we have conviction that superintelligence is going to improve every aspect of what we do,” Zuckerberg said in Meta’s July 30 earnings call. A Meta spokesperson told <em>Fortune</em> it’s impossible to say exactly what the complex will power since it’s unclear how AI will have evolved when it opens in 2030.



</p><p>The sheer size has left locals in this quiet region stunned.



</p><p>“I think, like a lot of people, my initial reaction was kind of blown away that a site [so] rural was selected for something like that,” said Justin Clark, pastor of First Baptist Church in nearby Rayville. “As we started learning more about what it was and what the scope entailed, that feeling just continued. An amazement of, ‘Good grief.’”



</p><p>Clark looks forward to welcoming new workers to the area but admits it’s difficult to truly visualize the scope. At a recent chamber of commerce banquet, they were told it’s the largest construction site in North America: “That’s unbelievable,” he marveled.</p><p>Altogether, Big Tech’s new data centers will be incredibly energy and water hungry. Keeping the Hyperion servers cool and functional will require twice the power of New Orleans—and eventually more.



</p><p>As AI’s boom shifts into ever-higher gears, speculation abounds about how utilities will quench Big Tech’s deepening thirst for electricity. In the case of Meta (22 on the Fortune 500), regional utility <a href="https://fortune.com/company/entergy/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/entergy/">Entergy</a> will build three new gas-fired turbines with a combined capacity of 2.3 gigawatts—the first such buildout in decades—sparking pushback from ratepayers worried about consumer costs and from climate advocates who fear a backslide from green energy goals.



</p><p>The scramble for AI dominance has positioned utilities as the gatekeepers of the hyperscaler market, weighing the benefits of massive capital investments for an emergent industry—whose future payoffs remain murky—versus potential rate hikes and the risk of stranded assets for decades to come.



</p><p>State regulators gave Entergy the green light Aug. 20—two months earlier than expected—potentially setting the template for future deals between utilities and Big Tech to build new power plants, increasingly in more rural locales with affordable land. Entergy and regulators called the deal a model for the nation’s data center and power proliferation.



</p><p>“This deal could signal to other states that this is how data centers should be governed and operated,” Louisiana Public Service Commissioner Davante Lewis told <em>Fortune</em>. “This would be a test across the nation. I’ve heard that from investors; I’ve heard that from credit agencies; I’ve heard that from fellow data centers—whatever comes out of the Meta deal may be the framework for them all.”</p><div><p><img alt="Meta is leveling the massive site for its data center complex in Richland Parish, Louisiana." loading="lazy" width="960" height="507" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 60vw, (max-width: 768px) 100vw, (max-width: 1200px) 33vw" srcset="https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Meta-site-e1749825864866.jpg?w=128&amp;q=85 128w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Meta-site-e1749825864866.jpg?w=256&amp;q=85 256w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Meta-site-e1749825864866.jpg?w=320&amp;q=85 320w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Meta-site-e1749825864866.jpg?w=384&amp;q=85 384w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Meta-site-e1749825864866.jpg?w=480&amp;q=85 480w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Meta-site-e1749825864866.jpg?w=576&amp;q=85 576w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Meta-site-e1749825864866.jpg?w=768&amp;q=85 768w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Meta-site-e1749825864866.jpg?w=1024&amp;q=85 1024w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Meta-site-e1749825864866.jpg?w=1280&amp;q=85 1280w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Meta-site-e1749825864866.jpg?w=1440&amp;q=85 1440w" src="https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Meta-site-e1749825864866.jpg?w=1440&amp;q=85"></p><figcaption>Meta is leveling the massive site for its data center complex in Richland Parish, Louisiana.</figcaption><p>Meta</p></div>



<h2>Meta’s Hyperion as the template</h2>



<p>Hyperion has plenty of local political support, but it also managed to unite some environmentalists and Big Oil in opposition, the latter of which voiced concerns about increased power costs for their refineries and petrochemical plants.



</p><p>“We’re not naive to the fact that it is a complex situation,” said Clark, noting conflicting local loyalties. “Some people who’ve lived in that area for generations feel displaced because of the development. At the same time, we don’t have any real say on whether it’s going to happen.”



</p><p>The Louisiana Energy Users Group—including <a href="https://fortune.com/company/exxon-mobil/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/exxon-mobil/">Exxon Mobil</a>, <a href="https://fortune.com/company/chevron/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/chevron/">Chevron</a>, and Shell—said the project increases Entergy’s Louisiana energy demand by 30%, creating unprecedented financial risks to existing utility ratepayers.



</p><p>Regardless, Entergy (No. 355 on the Fortune 500) now has the official go-ahead for its gas plants from the Public Service Commission (PSC), the five-person elected body that regulates utilities in the state. Lewis was the only one to vote in opposition. The hearing raised the same questions looming over the nation: How much energy is enough? Can states risk turning down massive economic development investments? And, after the advent of China’s DeepSeek—proving AI can become cheaper and more efficient—could the stampede for power be built on a bubble?



</p><p>The country already counts about 3,800 data centers—many built during the earlier cloud-computing boom—with the biggest chunk concentrated in Virginia’s so-called Data Center Alley, where 500 facilities find easy access to fiber-optic connectivity for high transfer speeds. But most of those are relatively small compared to what’s needed to power AI. This year alone, hyperscalers announced hundreds of billions of dollars to feed the growing generative AI needs.</p><p>Amazon, Google, and Microsoft are investing anywhere from $75 billion to $100 billion each into building data centers in 2025—numbers that would have strained the imagination of any economist just a couple of years ago. Meta’s data center budget is about $70 billion—way up from $28 billion last year—and expected to “ramp significantly” more in 2026 as part of Meta’s “massive bet” on superintelligence, Zuckerberg said.



</p><p>These projects depend on an astonishing amount of new power. A recent report from the U.S. Department of Energy estimates data centers’ grid needs could triple by 2028, consuming up to 12% of the nation’s electricity. OpenAI’s Stargate received an upfront investment of $100 billion in January for the $500 billion data center complex proposed in Texas, where more than 100 new gas plants are proposed to power it and other projects—though many will never come to fruition. Still, industry research group Enverus projects the next five years will bring roughly 46 gigawatts of gas-fired electricity online, a 20% jump in new construction.



</p><p>Experts agree some surge in electric capacity nationwide is needed. It’s the exact extent that’s unknown, said Cathy Kunkel, energy analyst for the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.



</p><p>Electricity demand in the U.S. held steady for 15 years but, last year, it increased by 3%— marking the fifth-highest rise this century. More jumps are projected for years to come.



</p><p>Meta’s and Entergy’s plans to meet that demand are “precedent setting,” Kunkel said.</p><p>Buoyed by the Meta project, Entergy’s stock has hit record highs. Meta, meanwhile, has taken on a significant chunk of the upfront costs in Richland.



</p><p>According to the contract, Meta will pay the power costs for the $3.2 billion gas plants for the first 15 years—more than the typical 10-year contract, but not as much as the 25 years critics sought—as well as some transmission costs. Meta also committed to help build 1.5 gigawatts of solar and battery power throughout Louisiana, despite the ongoing opposition from environmental groups.



</p><p>The arrangements could signal to the market this is the “new gold standard,” Lewis said. That’s a red flag for opponents.



</p><p>“The problem here is that this is going to set precedent,” Logan Burke, of the Alliance for Affordable Energy, testified Aug. 20. “This settlement puts all of us, all of your constituents and customers in the state, at the mercy of a non-public contract between two corporations.”

<h2>Risks of overbuilding or fears of shortages?</h2>



<p>The staggering scale of the project and the resource demands it entails have raised alarm bells for some in Louisiana, where the electric grid is already fragile.</p><p>In May, over 100,000 south Louisiana customers lost power after demand outstripped supply.



</p><p>“The Richland data center is to be the largest in the world,” said Margie Vicknair-Pray, coordinator with the Sierra Club’s Louisiana chapter. “How can we ensure that blackouts won’t become more frequent? What we have yet to fully understand is the impact the data center will have on the land, our resources, and the people.”



</p><p>While Meta has a non-binding promise to build more renewable energy, the Louisiana Legislature passed a new law that adds natural gas to the definition of green energy, allowing Zuckerberg and others to count Entergy’s gas turbines as “green.”



</p><p>Gas-fired plants pose other hurdles. There’s a shortage of turbine manufacturing in the global supply chain. Gas turbines are essentially sold out for the next five years.



</p><p>With the state bypassing the standard, lengthier review process, Lewis questions whether Entergy and Meta need extra turbines. “Why are we only focusing, quite frankly, on generation buildup?” he wondered, rather than grid efficiency and flexibility. He warned of Meta potentially walking away early, leaving ratepayers stuck with excess costs.</p><p>Entergy spokesman Brandon Scardigli told Fortune that “natural gas-fueled generation is the lowest reasonable cost option available that can support the 24/7 electrical demands of a large data center like Meta.”



</p><p>The other wild card is the expectation for improvements in computing and power efficiency. Kunkel concluded an inevitability. The projects will use less energy, she said, “either because they get more efficient or because they don’t and go bankrupt.”



</p><p>It could mean utilities—and Big Tech—find themselves pouring capital into new gas generation no one needs.

<h2>What and where else?</h2>



<p>As huge data centers spread throughout rural locales nationwide, Vicknair-Pray questioned the impact of air and noise pollution on farmers and ranchers, and especially the massive water consumption that could impact their livelihoods.



</p><p>“How will the water be shared?” she asked. “And what happens if the farmers are unable to water their crops?”</p><p>The nonpartisan think tank Energy Innovation proposes that hyperscalers invest primarily in renewable energy and battery storage developments, with some new gas-fired power used only as needed for backup.



</p><p>Mike O’Boyle, senior director of electricity policy at Energy Innovation, believes building too many new gas turbines poses unnecessary risks. “I know the environment right now, federally and in the industry, is ‘Build, build, build,’ as fast as we can.” But costs must be considered. “We’re in a limited resource environment where supply is much lower than demand, and it’s causing prices to skyrocket.”



</p><p><a href="https://fortune.com/company/overstock-com/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/overstock-com/">Beyond</a> Virginia, data centers currently are concentrated in the biggest states, such as Texas and California. But part of what makes data centers attractive to developers is they open industrial development for economically depressed areas that aren’t near ports or airports—such as Richland Parish.



</p><p>Adam Robinson, an energy analyst with Enverus, looked at where the buildout may head next. He said many factors are considered by developers: Power and land prices and availability, grid and fiber-optic connectivity, and the time it takes to connect to the grid.



</p><p>Robinson predicts a lot of development in the PJM Interconnection (Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland) region from New Jersey through the Rust Belt and into Illinois. The region is attracting hyperscalers thanks to competitive power markets, good connectivity, and high data-transfer speeds.</p><p>Developers looking for large plots of affordable land also are looking West, while co-location and smaller developers are more focused on cheap land and tax incentives in Texas and the Deep South, Robinson said. Louisiana, for instance, exempted the Meta deal from sales taxes.



</p><p>Pastor Clark recognizes that tech progress is inevitable in Richland and everywhere else.



</p><p>“It is happening,” he said, “so we want to make the best of it.”

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><span><span>For a few dozen people in the world, the downside of living with a rare immune condition comes with a surprising superpower—the ability to fight off all viruses. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Columbia immunologist Dusan Bogunovic discovered the individuals’ antiviral powers about 15 years ago, soon after he identified the genetic mutation that causes the condition.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>At first, the condition only seemed to increase vulnerability to some bacterial infections. But as more patients were identified, its unexpected antiviral benefits became apparent. Bogunovic, a professor of pediatric immunology at Columbia University’s Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, soon learned that everyone with the mutation, which causes a deficiency in an immune regulator called ISG15, has mild, but persistent systemic inflammation. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>“The type of inflammation they had was antiviral, and that’s when it dawned on me that these individuals could be hiding something,” Bogunovic recalls. When he and his colleagues looked at the individuals’ immune cells, they could see encounters with all sorts of viruses—flu, measles, mumps, chickenpox. But the patients had never reported any overt signs of infection or illness.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>“In the back of my mind, I kept thinking that if we could produce this type of light immune activation in other people, we could protect them from just about any virus,” Bogunovic says. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Today, Bogunovic is closing in on a therapeutic strategy that could provide that broad-spectrum protection against viruses and become an important weapon in next pandemic.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>In his latest study, published Aug. 13 in <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.adx5758">Science Translational Medicine</a>, Bogunovic and his team report that an experimental therapy they’ve developed temporarily gives recipients (hamsters and mice, so far) the same antiviral superpower as people with ISG15 deficiency. When administered prophylactically into the animals' lungs via a nasal drip, the therapy prevented viral replication of influenza and SARS-CoV-2 viruses and lessened disease severity.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>In cell culture, “we have yet to find a virus that can break through the therapy’s defenses,” Bogunovic says. </span></span></p>
<h2><span><span>Mimicking the immune superpowers of a rare condition</span></span></h2>
<p><span><span>Bogunovic’s therapy is designed to mimic what happens in people with ISG15 deficiency, but only for a short time.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Instead of turning off ISG15 directly—which leads to the production of more than 60 proteins—Bogunovic’s therapeutic turns on production of 10 proteins that are primarily responsible for the broad antiviral protection.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The current design resembles COVID mRNA vaccines but with a twist: Ten mRNAs encoding the 10 proteins are packaged inside a lipid nanoparticle. Once the nanoparticles are absorbed by the recipient’s cells, the cells generate the ten host proteins to produce the antiviral protection.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>“We only generate a small amount of these ten proteins, for a very short time, and that leads to much less inflammation than what we see in ISG15-deficient individuals,” Bogunovic says. “But that inflammation is enough to prevent antiviral diseases.”</span></span></p>
<h2><span><span>Foundation for future therapy</span></span></h2>
<p><span><span><span>Bogunovic’s team sees their technology as a weapon for the next pandemic—providing protection for first responders, people in nursing homes, and family members of infected individuals—</span>regardless of the responsible virus. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>“We believe the technology will work even if we don’t know the identity of the virus,” Bogunovic says. Importantly, the antiviral protection provided by the technology will not prevent people from developing their own immunological memory to the virus for longer-term protection.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>But the technology’s drug delivery and absorption properties still need optimization. When delivered to animals via nanoparticles, the 10 proteins were produced in the lungs, “but probably not at high enough levels that makes us comfortable going into people immediately,” Bogunovic says. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>“Once the therapy reaches our cells, it works, but the delivery of any nucleic acid, DNA or RNA, into the part of the body you want to protect is currently the biggest challenge in the field.” The researchers also need to determine how long the therapy’s antiviral protection will last, currently estimated at three to four days. </span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>“Our findings reinforce the power of research driven by curiosity without preconceived notions,” Bogunovic says. “We were not looking for an antiviral when we began studying our rare patients, but the studies have inspired the potential development of a universal antiviral for everyone."</span></span></p>

    <p data-block-key="vq658"><strong>Prompt:</strong> A classic, faded photograph capturing a scene from a 1960s recording studio, featuring these two blue characters. They are depicted in the control room, surrounded by the warm glow of vacuum tubes and the complex array of a large-format mixing console. The larger of the two blue figures has a pair of bulky headphones placed slightly askew on its head and gazes peacefully through the soundproof glass at a musician in the live room. The smaller character, perched on a stool, wears a tiny pair of round, 1960s-style glasses and is turned slightly to adjust a knob on a reel-to-reel tape machine. The entire image has the aesthetic of an aged photograph, with a grainy texture, soft focus, and a desaturated, warm color palette.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<article>
   
  <div><p>I am responsible for approving SSL certificates for my company. I’ve developed a
process over the past couple of years that works well. My stakeholders
understand their roles and responsibilities and put up a minimal amount of fuss
as I review and approve each cert. What started out as a quarterly or
semi-monthly task has become a monthly-to-weekly task depending on when our
certs are expiring.</p>
<p>I appreciate the amount of trust put into certificates and understand that they
are a critical component of digital security. But this 💩 is getting out of
hand.  When certificates underpin nearly all digital security, including VPNs,
WiFi, Email, Websites, APIs, and more, increasing the administrative burden of
managing them will have diminishing returns.</p>
<p>And, I think it’s going to push organizations away from traditional
Certificate Authorities (CAs) in the long run.</p>
<h2 id="validation-mechanisms">Validation Mechanisms</h2>
<p>Our certificate issuer used to allow a number of handy validation methods.</p>
<p>In 2021, <a href="https://knowledge.digicert.com/alerts/domain-validation-policy-changes-in-2021">they announced</a> that file-based domain validation would be
disallowed for wildcard certificates. When used for non-wildcard certs,
file-based domain validation would be required for every individual SAN/FQDN.
This was a minor annoyance, because at the time we had some automation that
would allow us to renew certs with minimal fuss.</p>
<p>File-based domain validation <em>was</em> less secure; one dangling DNS record or
webserver mis-configuration is all it takes to hijack a certificate. (I
recommend any organization leveraging PaaS platforms like AWS or GCP might want
to consider a thorough DNS inventory and cleanup if they haven’t recently; you
may be surprised by what you find.)</p>
<p>The remaining domain control validation (DCV) methods for my organization have
been reduced to two options: DNS TXT recrods and email-based validation. One of
these is completely useless: we don’t set up email addresses for every possible
subdomain, so email-based validation may as well not exist when we need to
update a certificate for <code>test.lab.corp.example.com</code> because there is no
<code><a href="https://www.chrislockard.net/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="8ef9ebece3effdfaebfccefaebfdfaa0e2efeca0ede1fcfea0ebf6efe3fee2eba0ede1e3">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></code>. But, it’s not just validation methods.
There are new defenses requiring more stringent validation.</p>
<p>DNS validation is a decent and secure option in an organization where DNS
management access is tightly controlled. I don’t generally have a problem with
it as it’s a straightforward and small time sink to implement.</p>
<h2 id="defending-against-hijacking-and-spoofing">Defending against Hijacking and Spoofing</h2>
<p>A recent change aims to thwart BGP hijacking and DNS spoofing attacks. Starting
next month, DigiCert (and presumably other CAs) will require <a href="https://www.digicert.com/blog/mpic-for-digital-certificates">Multi-Perspective
Issuance Corroboration (MPIC)</a> checks.</p>
<p>On the face of it, this seems like a good idea. MPIC requires CAs to perform DCV
from two or more global vantage points (RIR regions). This should dramatically
reduce the risk of mis-issuance via BGP attacks. But I wonder how many
organizations segment access to their apps based on geography that this will
impact. I <em>also</em> wonder how many organizations have had certificates mis-issued
due to BGP hijacking.</p>
<div>
  <p><span>ℹ️</span></p><div>
    <p><strong>A Note on Timing</strong></p><p>A particular annoyance I’ve encountered is the notification messages for these
potentially breaking changes. In several cases, I’ve received notification of an
upcoming major change (like MPIC) just a few weeks before it will take place.</p>
<p>Communicating these major changes with such short timeframes is <em>extremely</em>
damaging to the trust and relationship I’ve built with my stakeholders. I feel a
combination of guilt and frustration when I have to Slack a group of people I
<em>know</em> are swamped and sheepishly say “<em>Hey, there’s a potentially huge breaking
change happening soon. Y’know, for security. Please help me make sure we aren’t
going to break anything when this goes live.</em>”</p>

  </div>
</div>


<p>Yes, this will improve the warm fuzzy security feeling we all want at night, but
how much <em>actual</em> risk is this requirement mitigating? The email notifications
telling me I have weeks to implement this change make vague assertions of the
risks, almost like they are trying to justify a thought exercise. Or an
<a href="https://www.princeton.edu/~pmittal/publications/bgp-tls-hotpets17">academic theoretical</a> (which itself acknowledges “no study has yet
to measure the effectiveness of these attacks on real-world certificate
authorities”)</p>
<p>Although certainly not exhaustive, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BGP_hijacking">Wikipedia page on BGP
hijacking</a> lists one example of a BGP hijack resulting in a mis-issued
certificate, and that was for a South Korean cryptocurrency company in 2021.
Total loss (according to Wikipedia): $1.9m USD.</p>
<p>Huh. I <em>wonder</em> if industry is going to lose more than $1.9m implementing MPIC?
🤔</p>
<p>But the absolute worst change is coming, incrementally, over the next three
years.</p>
<h2 id="validation-lifetimes">Validation Lifetimes</h2>
<p>The most obnoxious change is the ongoing shortening of the certificate
validation window. Sure, letting certificates stay valid for 825 days was a bit
much. Okay. I get that. 10 year validation periods? Totes extreme.</p>
<p>Today, certificates are valid for 397 days or around 13 months. This is actually
a decent compromise between security and operational overhead, because it
ensures rotation without being too burdensome to schedules and AOP. The most
significant issue is when many certificates are grouped together on a single
expiration date, but that can be managed easily enough with some planning.</p>
<p>But by March 15, 2029, the maximum lifetime for an SSL certificate will be just
<strong><a href="https://www.digicert.com/blog/tls-certificate-lifetimes-will-officially-reduce-to-47-days">47 days</a></strong>.</p>
<p>47 days. <em>47 days!</em></p>
<p>Maybe AI will have made my job redundant by then and this will all be ChatGPT’s
problem. But I doubt it.</p>
<p>I’m sure in the Ivory Tower or the companies with extremely well-funded and
over-staffed security teams, this is no big deal. “But of course we should do
this, it’s just a little more work for a team of 50 engineers with dedicated
developers!” Should I be grateful they didn’t decide on 47 hours instead?</p>
<p>I am grateful for a multi-year ramp-up to this change. But for the rest of us
treading water and trying to make significant incremental change, this does
nothing but dictate our roadmap for the next three years.</p>
<h2 id="money-changes-hands">Money Changes Hands</h2>
<p>So, with all of these challenges facing us, what is our organization to do? I’m
sure CAs like DigiCert are expecting to make more money off of us as we struggle
to implement these changes. Indeed, there are CA consulting services that will
offer to “bring PKI and DNS together to validate domain ownership and issue
certificates without manual DNS record updates”.</p>
<p>For a fee, of course. By reaching out to the sales team, of course.</p>
<p>What I’m not sure the CAs are considering is that we will instead move as much
of our certificate business off of them as possible.</p>
<p>Any platforms that offer or include certificate management bundled with the
actual services we pay for will win our business by default. Even if there’s
incremental cost for so doing, we will gladly pay the platform to manage
certificates on our behalf since that frees up several expensive engineers from
that responsibility.</p>
<h2 id="so-what">So What?</h2>
<p>These validation tweaks and shrinking lifetimes are interconnected and they
amplify each other’s obnoxiousness. Each one, academically, makes sense for
improving security. However, I can’t help but wonder if the CA/Browser Forum is
aware of the cumulative impact of these changes on under-resourced organizations
or overworked IT departments. Maybe they are and they don’t care. But the CA
vendors should care, because I think they will lose business over incremental
changes like these.</p>
<p>My organization will almost certainly move much of our certificate business to
individual platforms or to free CAs like <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">letsencrypt</a> with
automation either taken care of for us or easily implemented.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_Certificate_Management_Environment">ACME</a> might be a solution to some of these challenges, but it’s not
problem-free. <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/docs/client-options/">Which client</a> do we use? Which resource-starved team
will manage the client and the infrastructure it needs? It will need time to
undergo code review and/or supplier review if it’s sold by a company. There will
be a requirement for secrets management. There will be a need for monitoring and
alerting. It’s not as painless as the certificate approval workflow I have
now.</p>
<p>Are these changes making the Internet more secure? Maybe. Probably. But it’s not
obvious to me that the trade-off is worth it if the work needed to manage
certificates prevents project work from getting done.</p>
<p>What is obvious to me is that my stakeholders and I are hurrying to offload
certificate management to our vendors and platforms and not to our CA.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p><span>+COMMENT</span> US president Donald Trump has threatened to impose extra tariffs on imports from any nation that dares to regulate American technology companies.</p>
<p>Trump took to Truth Social on Monday evening to <a target="_blank" href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115092243259973570">declare</a> “As the President of the United States, I will stand up to Countries that attack our incredible American Tech Companies.”</p>
<p>“Digital Taxes, Digital Services Legislation, and Digital Markets Regulations are all designed to harm, or discriminate against, American Technology. They also, outrageously, give a complete pass to China's largest Tech Companies,” he added.</p>

    

<p>“This must end, and NOW!” his post continued, before promising “substantial additional Tariffs” on any nation that dares to persist with regulations, plus “Export restrictions on our Highly Protected Technology and Chips.”</p>

        


        

<p>“America, and American Technology Companies, are neither the ‘piggy bank’ nor the ‘doormat’ of the World any longer,” he added, before wrapping things up with a demand to “Show respect to America and our amazing Tech Companies or, consider the consequences!”</p>
<h3>+COMMENT Bending the Truth</h3>
<p>The post makes no mention of the following known facts about American Big tech companies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most are extraordinarily profitable;</li>

<li>Most use legal-but-cynical schemes to minimize tax, which is why many nations devised digital services taxes and other measures to ensure Big Tech pays its share;</li>

<li>The USA pulled out of the OECD’s comprehensive tax reforms, which aimed to prevent global companies – especially tech companies – from using legal-but-cynical schemes to minimize tax. Doing so meant other nations who wanted to tax Big Tech needed to consider other measures;</li>

<li>Several American tech companies are proven monopolists who abused market power at home and abroad;</li>

<li>Several offer services known to be harmful – especially social media companies – creating problems that other nations must pay to fix;</li>

<li>Chinese companies do not get a free pass: Many nations have regulated them with acts such as banning Huawei. Europe just took a swipe at <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/06/19/ec_aliexpress_investigation_finds_failings/">AliExpress</a>;</li>

<li>Trump himself has given Chinese company ByteDance and its social network TikTok a free pass by declining to enact a law that required it to divest its US operations or shut up shop stateside by January 19th, 2025. US Congress passed that law after finding TikTok is a threat to national security.</li>
</ul>
<p>We could go on, but you get the idea. America’s tech companies are immensely powerful, efforts to rein them in have seldom succeeded, and China does not get a free pass.</p>

<p>Trump has <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/02/24/trump_administration_dst_countertariffs/">made threats like this before</a>, but this time he has raised the stakes by adding the prospect of tech export bans.</p>
<p>Such bans would likely harm other US tech companies. Chipmakers aren’t subject to digital services taxes, and lost billions when the administration banned sales of all GPUs to China. A comprehensive tech export ban could defend Google and Meta by hurting Intel – which the USA <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/25/intel_gets_trumped/">now partially owns</a> – and the likes of Nvidia and AMD.</p>
<p>Recent history suggests two possible outcomes: The world will try to negotiate with Washington about this matter and end up making modest concessions the president claims as a win, or nothing happens because Trump’s posts are often thought bubbles. ®</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://stratechery.com/2025/u-s-intel/">https://stratechery.com/2025/u-s-intel/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45024786">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>




<p>Now that everyone is using ChatGPT, the lazy columnist’s trick of quoting Wikipedia to open an Article is less cliché than it is charming (at least that’s my excuse). Anyhow, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man#Steelmanning">here is Wikipedia’s definition of “steelmanning”</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>A steel man argument (or steelmanning) is the opposite of a straw man argument. Steelmanning is the practice of applying the rhetorical principle of charity through addressing the strongest form of the other person’s argument, even if it is not the one they explicitly presented. Creating the strongest form of the opponent’s argument may involve removing flawed assumptions that could be easily refuted or developing the strongest points which counter one’s own position. Developing counters to steel man arguments may produce a stronger argument for one’s own position.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The beauty of being in the rather lonely position of supporting <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/trump-to-announce-u-s-taking-nearly-10-stake-in-intel-1a38225d">the U.S. government taking an equity stake in Intel</a> is that I don’t have to steelman the case about it being a bad idea. Scott Lincicome, for example, had a <a href="https://x.com/scottlincicome/status/1958947597478944929">good Twitter thread</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/08/24/trump-intel-government-marketplace/">Washington Post column</a> explaining why this is a terrible idea; this is the opening of the latter:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>President Donald Trump’s announcement on Friday that the U.S. government will take a 10 percent stake in long-struggling Intel marks a dangerous turn in American industrial policy. Decades of market-oriented principles have been abandoned in favor of unprecedented government ownership of private enterprise. Sold as a pragmatic and fiscally responsible way to shore up national security, the $8.9 billion equity investment marks a troubling departure from the economic policies that made America prosperous and the world’s undisputed technological leader.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Lincicome lists a number of problems with this transaction, including (but not limited to!):</p>



<ul>
<li>Intel making decisions for political rather than commercial considerations</li>



<li>Intel’s board prioritizing government interests over their fiduciary duties</li>



<li>Other companies being pressured to purchase Intel products, weakening their long-term position.</li>



<li>Disadvantaging the competitive position of other companies</li>



<li>Incentivizing the misallocation of private capital</li>
</ul>



<p>Lincicome and all of the other critics of this deal are absolutely correct about all of the downsides. The problem with their argument, however, is the lack of steelmanning, in two respects: first, Lincicome’s Twitter thread doesn’t mention “China” or “Taiwan” once (the Washington Post column mentions China, but not in a national security context). Second, Lincicome et al refuse to grapple with the possibility that chips generally, and foundries specifically, really are a unique case.</p>



<h3>The Geopolitical Case</h3>



<p>There is a reason I’ve written so much about chips, and for many years before the AI wave brought the industry to prominence; start with 2020’s <a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/chips-and-geopolitics/">Chips and Geopolitics</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The international status of Taiwan is, as they say, complicated. So, for that matter, are U.S.-China relations. These two things can and do overlap to make entirely new, even more complicated complications.</p>



<p>Geography is much more straightforward:</p>

<p>Taiwan, you will note, is just off the coast of China. South Korea, home to Samsung, which also makes the highest end chips, although mostly for its own use, is just as close. The United States, meanwhile, is on the other side of the Pacific Ocean. There are advanced foundries in Oregon, New Mexico, and Arizona, but they are operated by Intel, and Intel makes chips for its own integrated use cases only.</p>



<p>The reason this matters is because chips matter for many use cases outside of PCs and servers — Intel’s focus — which is to say that TSMC matters. Nearly every piece of equipment these days, military or otherwise, has a processor inside. Some of these don’t require particularly high performance, and can be manufactured by fabs built years ago all over the U.S. and across the world; others, though, require the most advanced processes, which means they must be manufactured in Taiwan by TSMC.</p>



<p>This is a big problem if you are a U.S. military planner. Your job is not to figure out if there will ever be a war between the U.S. and China, but to plan for an eventuality you hope never occurs. And in that planning the fact that TSMC’s foundries — and Samsung’s — are within easy reach of Chinese missiles is a major issue.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The rise of AI makes these realities — and related issues like chip controls — even more pressing. I made the argument earlier this year in <a href="https://stratechery.com/2025/ai-promise-and-chip-precariousness/">AI Promise and Chip Precariousness</a> that the U.S. should be seeking to make China more dependent on both U.S. chip companies and TSMC manufacturing, even as it was doing the opposite. The motivation was to preserve dominance in AI, but this ignored the reality I just laid out: AI depends on chips, and those chips are made next door to China; that means that stopping China could be worse than China succeeding:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s also worth noting that success in stopping China’s AI efforts has its own risks: another reason why China has held off from moving against Taiwan is the knowledge that every year they wait increases their relative advantages in all the real world realities I listed above; that makes it more prudent to wait. The prospect of the U.S. developing the sort of AI that matters in a military context, however, even as China is cut off, changes that calculus: now the prudent course is to move sooner rather than later, particularly if the U.S. is dependent on Taiwan for the chips that make that AI possible.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Beyond the human calamity that would result from a Chinese attack on Taiwan, there is the economic calamity downstream of not just losing AI chips, but chips of all sorts, including the basic semiconductors that power not just computers but basically everything in the world. And, to that end, it’s worth pointing out that an Intel that succeeds <a href="https://stratechery.com/2022/chips-and-china/">doesn’t fully address our chip dependency on Taiwan</a>. It is, however, a pre-requisite, and any argument about the U.S. government’s involvement with Intel must grapple with this reality.</p>



<h3>Decisions Over Decades</h3>



<p>There was one line in Lincicome’s Article that definitely made me raise my eyebrows (<em>emphasis mine</em>):</p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong>The semiconductor industry, more than most, requires nimble responses to rapidly changing technology and market conditions.</strong> Intel already faces significant operational and competitive challenges; it has been a technological laggard for more than a decade as Nvidia, AMD, TSMC and other competitors have raced ahead. Adding a layer of political oversight to Intel’s already-complex turnaround effort is far more likely to hinder than help.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>I get Lincicome’s point, which certainly applies to the technology industry broadly; just look at all of the upheaval that has happened in the two-and-a-half years since ChatGPT launched. I would argue, however, that chips are different: Intel is a technological laggard because of choices made decades ago; it just takes a really long time for the consequences of mistakes to show up.</p>



<p>Starting a new blog is a bit like a band publishing their debut album: you’re full of takes that you’ve held for years and have been waiting to unleash. In my case, I had been worried about Intel ever since <a href="https://stratechery.com/2022/an-interview-with-father-of-the-ipod-tony-fadell/">they missed out on mobile</a>, which meant they missed out on the associated volume that came from making chips for every smartphone in the world. Volume is critical when it comes to managing the ever-expanding cost of staying on the leading edge: as the cost of fabs has surged from hundreds of millions to tens of billions of dollars, the only way to fab chips profitably is to have enough volume over which to spread those massive capital expenditures.</p>



<p>And so, within a month of launching Stratechery, <a href="https://stratechery.com/2013/the-intel-opportunity/">I wrote that Intel needed to become a foundry</a> — i.e. make chips for other companies — if they wanted to remain viable in the long run. And, to be honest, I had been saving up that take for so long that I thought I was too late; after all, I started Stratechery in 2013, six years into the mobile era, and given the massive changes Intel would have to undergo to become a customer service organization, I thought they needed to make that change at least three years earlier.</p>



<p>And then, for the next eight years, Intel’s stock went up and up, <a href="https://stratechery.com/2025/apple-and-the-ghosts-of-companies-past/">as the company rode the cloud boom that was the yin to the smartphone’s yang</a>. If anyone had read my 2013 Article and sold their Intel shares, or worse, shorted them, they would have lost their shirt!</p>



<p>In the end, however, my take was correct, even if it was un-investable. First Intel fell behind TSMC, who was powered by massive orders from Apple in particular, and then, <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4804322-intel-corporation-intc-q2-2025-earnings-call-transcript">on the company’s last earnings call</a>, CEO Lip-Bu Tan admitted the reality of what could have been forecasted when Steve Jobs walked onto that 2007 MacWorld stage:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Up to and through Intel 18A, we could generate a reasonable return on our investments with only Intel Products. The increase in capital cost at Intel 14A, make it clear that we need both Intel products, and a meaningful external customer to drive acceptable returns on our deployed capital, and I will only invest when I’m confident those returns exist.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This is the rotten tree sprung from the seed of Intel’s mobile failure: the company could afford to miss out on a massive market for nearly two decades, but when it comes to 14A, the company simply can’t sell enough chips on its own to justify the investment.</p>



<p>What is worse is the tree that wasn’t planted: the real payoff from Intel building a foundry business in 2010, or 2013 as I recommended, is that they would have been ready for the AI boom. Every hyperscaler is still complaining that demand exceeds supply for AI chips, even as Intel can’t win customers for its newest process that is <a href="https://stratechery.com/2025/tsmc-earnings-a16-and-tsmcs-approach-to-backside-power-intel-earnings-architecture-and-ai/">actually best-suited for AI chips</a>. The company simply has too many other holes in its offering, including the sort of reliability and throughput that is essential to earning customer trust.</p>



<p>In short, contra Lincicome, Intel’s problem is not short-term decision-making, because Intel is in the business of making chips, and making chips is a decades-long endeavor of building expertise, gaining volume, moving down the learning curve, and doing it all again and again to the tune of tens of billions of dollars a year in capex.</p>



<p>That, by extension, is why the stakes today are so high. The problem facing the U.S. is not simply the short-term: the real problems will arise in the 2030s and beyond. Semiconductor manufacturing decision-making does not require nimbleness; it requires gravity and the knowledge that abandoning the leading edge entails never regaining it.</p>



<h3>Competing with TSMC</h3>



<p>This also puts to rest one of the traditional objections to government intervention in support of an incumbent: in almost every case that investment crowds out new companies, companies that are, yes, more nimble and more capable of meeting the moment. The reality of semiconductor manufacturing, however, is that the path is far too long and arduous to ever fill the vacuum that Intel’s exit would leave. Actually, though, that last line is not quite right: Intel’s biggest problem is that its market challenges are closer to that mythical startup that will never exist.</p>



<p>Suppose our mythical startup somehow received hundreds of billions of dollars worth of funding, and somehow moved down the decades-long learning curve that undergirds modern silicon manufacturing: to make the business work our mythical startup would actually need to find customers.</p>



<p>Our mythical startup, however, doesn’t exist in a vacuum: it exists in the same world as TSMC, the company who has defined the modern pure play foundry. TSMC has put in the years, and they’ve put in the money; TSMC has the unparalleled customer service approach that created the entire fabless chip industry; and, critically, TSMC, just as they did in the mobile era, is aggressively investing to meet the AI moment. If you’re an Nvidia, or an Apple in smartphones, or an AMD or a Qualcomm, why would you take the chance of fabricating your chips anywhere else? Sure, TSMC is raising prices in the face of massive demand, but the overall cost of a chip in a system is still quite small; is it worth risking your entire business to save a few dollars for worse performance with a worse customer experience that costs you time to market and potentially catastrophic product failures?</p>



<p>We know our mythical startup would face these challenges because they are the exact challenges Intel faces. Intel may need “a meaningful external customer to drive acceptable returns on [its] deployed capital”, but Intel’s needs do not drive the decision-making of those external customers, despite the fact that Intel, while not fully caught up to TSMC, is at least in the ballpark, something no startup could hope to achieve for decades.</p>



<h3>Intel’s Credibility Problem</h3>



<p>These realities are why <a href="https://stratechery.com/2024/intel-honesty/">I argued a year ago that the U.S. government needed to prop up demand for Intel manufacturing</a>, a point I reiterated <a href="https://stratechery.com/2025/ai-promise-and-chip-precariousness/">earlier this year</a>. And, to steelman the argument of those opposed to this deal, there are ways to do that without acquiring part of the company.</p>



<p>The problem, however, comes back to what Tan said on that earnings call: beyond all of the challenges above, what company is going to go through the trouble of getting their chip working on Intel’s process if it’s possible that the company is going to abandon manufacturing on the next process? It’s a catch-22: Intel needs an external customer to make its foundry viable, but no external customer will go with Intel if there is a possibility that Intel Foundry will not be viable. In other words, the stakes have changed from even earlier this year: Intel doesn’t just need demand, it needs to be able to credibly guarantee would-be customers that it is in manufacturing for the long haul.</p>



<p>A standalone Intel cannot credibly make this promise. The path of least resistance for Intel has always been to simply give up manufacturing and become another TSMC customer; they already fab some number of their chips with the Taiwanese giant. Such a decision would — after some <em>very</em> difficult write-offs and wind-down operations — change the company into a much higher margin business; yes, the company’s chip designs have fallen behind as well, but at least they would be on the most competitive process, with a lot of their legacy customer base still on their side.</p>



<p>The problem for the U.S. is that that then means pinning all of the country’s long-term chip fabrication hopes on TSMC and Samsung not just building fabs in the United States, but also building up a credible organization in the U.S. that could withstand the loss of their headquarters and engineering knowhow in their home countries. <a href="https://stratechery.com/2025/tesla-and-samsung-customer-service-and-intel-the-u-s-semi-supply-chain/">There have been some important steps in this regard</a>, but at the end of the day it seems reckless for the U.S. to place both its national security and its entire economy in the hands of foreign countries next door to China, allies or not.</p>



<p>Given all of this, acquiring 10% of Intel, terrible though it may be for all of the reasons Lincicome articulates — and I haven’t even touched on the legality of this move — is I think the least bad option. In fact, you can even make the case that a lot of what Lincicome views as a problem has silver linings:</p>



<ul>
<li>Intel deciding to stay in manufacturing is arguably making a political decision, not a commercial one; however, it is important for the U.S. that Intel stay in manufacturing.</li>



<li>Intel prioritizing government interests — which are inherently focused on national security and the long-term viability of U.S. semiconductor manufacturing —&nbsp;over their fiduciary duties could just as easily be framed as valuing the long-term over the short term; had Intel done just that over the last two decades they wouldn’t be in this position.</li>



<li>Other companies being pressured to purchase Intel products is exactly what Intel needs to not just be viable in manufacturing, but also to actually get better.</li>



<li>If TSMC and Samsung are disadvantaged by not making chips in the U.S., that’s a good thing from the U.S. perspective. Both companies are investing here; the U.S. wants more.</li>



<li>Private capital prioritizing U.S. manufacturing is a good thing!</li>
</ul>



<p>The single most important reason for the U.S. to own part of Intel, however, is the implicit promise that Intel Foundry is not going anywhere. There simply isn’t a credible way to make that promise without having skin in the game, and that is now the case.</p>



<h3>Steelmanning</h3>



<p>I’ll be honest: there is a very good chance this won’t work. Intel really is a mess: they are actively hostile to customers, no one in the industry trusts them, they prioritize the wrong things even today (i.e. technical innovation with backwide power over yields for chips which don’t necessarily have interference issues), and that’s even without getting into the many problems with their business. Moreover, I led with Lincicome’s argument because I agree! Government involvement in private business almost always ends badly.</p>



<p>At the same time, the China concerns are real, Intel Foundry needs a guarantee of existence to even court customers, and there really is no coming back from an exit. There won’t be a startup to fill Intel’s place. The U.S. will be completely dependent on foreign companies for the most important products on earth, and while everything may seem fine for the next five, ten, or even fifteen years, the seeds of that failure will eventually sprout, just like those 2007 seeds sprouted for Intel over the last couple of years. The only difference is that the repercussions of this failure will be catastrophic not for the U.S.’s leading semiconductor company, but for the U.S. itself.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>25 Aug 2025</p><p>For the last ten years or so of working on Bundler, I’ve had a wish rattling around: I want a better dependency manager. It doesn’t just manage your gems, it manages your ruby versions, too. It doesn’t just manage your ruby versions, it installs pre-compiled rubies so you don’t have to wait for ruby to compile from source every time. And more than all of that, it makes it completely trivial to run any script or tool written in ruby, even if that script or tool needs a different ruby than your application does.</p><p>During all those years of daydreaming, I’ve been hoping someone else would build this tool and I could just use it. Then I discovered that someone <em>did</em> build it… but for Python. It’s called <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/"><code>uv</code></a>, and almost exactly one year ago <a href="https://astral.sh/blog/uv-unified-python-packaging">version 0.3 shipped</a> with all the features I had wished for, and even a few more that I hadn’t thought to wish for.</p><p>Originally created as an alternative to <code>pip</code>, <code>poetry</code>, and all the other Python dependency managers, <code>uv</code> grew to encompass several existing tools, and has a few completely new tricks up its sleeve.</p><p>At this point, I’ve been using <code>uv</code> for almost a year and I have to say, it is really, really good. The combination of speed, reliability, and functionality creates a spectacularly good experience. No more changing a package as you install something new only to realize later you broke something old, no more setting up dependencies manually only to have the cronned script break later.</p><p>About a month ago, I decided that if there was no tool like this for Ruby, I would make one rather than keep dreaming about it. I want to bring all the tricks and innovations of <code>cargo</code>, <code>npm</code>, and <code>uv</code> into a tool for Ruby: <code>rv</code>.</p><p>The first and biggest trick is simply how fast everything is because <code>rv</code> is written in Rust, like <code>uv</code> is. We expect to be able to silently run equivalents of both <code>rvm install</code> and <code>bundle install</code> at the beginning of every <code>bundle exec</code>, with everything still feeling faster than it ever has before.</p><p>The next innovation is <code>rvx</code>/<code>rv tool run</code>, inspired by <code>uvx</code>/<code>uv tool run</code>. It’s like <code>npx</code>/<code>npm exec</code> or <code>gem exec</code>, but with superpowers. Any CLI command can run directly and immediately. No messing around with versions or dependencies, because they get installed as part of running the command. It will also be impossible for a CLI tool to conflict with your current project’s Ruby or gems, because the tool’s Ruby and gems will be installed in a separate and isolated environment.</p><p>Closely related to <code>rv tool run</code> is <code>rv tool install</code>, which lets you install any gem as a CLI tool with its own separate, isolated Ruby and gems. Want to use the <code>gist</code> gem, even while working on an app that needs a different Ruby? No problem. <code>rv tool install gist</code>, and then you have a <code>gist</code> command that you can run anywhere, whether you’re in another Ruby app or not.</p><p>Another “powered up” feature is script support, where a single file script contains the information from <code>.ruby-version</code>, from <code>Gemfile</code>, and from <code>Gemfile.lock</code>, together with the code. You can simply <code>rv run script.rb</code>, and you get the Ruby you need, the gems with versions you need, and the script runs.</p><p>Ultimately, though, the biggest change from anything that exists today is combining all these tools together into one place. By managing both Ruby versions and gems at once, <code>rv</code> is a tool that can just run whatever you want to run. Whether it’s a CLI tool, a webapp, or a random script, <code>rv</code> will always ensure your entire environment is correct as part of running the command.</p><p>Our end goal is a completely new kind of management tool, where you don’t need to install rvm and then install ruby and then update rubygems and then update bundler and then bundle install your gems and then run your actual command—you just run your command, and everything is handled.</p><p>Not a version manager, or a dependency manager, but both of those things and more. I’m currently calling this category a “language manager”, but if you have a better name idea, let me know!</p><p>After a few weeks, the team now includes <a href="https://segiddins.me/">Samuel Giddins</a> from the RubyGems team, and <a href="https://sls.name/">Sam Stephenson</a>, the original creator of <a href="https://rbenv.org/">rbenv</a>. We have the first step in the plan working: <code>rv</code> can auto-switch between installed Ruby versions in zsh, but most importantly <strong>it can install precompiled Ruby 3.4.x on macOS and Ubuntu in one second flat</strong>.</p><p>If you just want to try what we have so far, <a href="https://github.com/spinel-coop/rv">check out the <code>rv</code> repo</a>. You can also read more about <a href="https://github.com/spinel-coop/rv/blob/main/docs/PLANS.md">our future plans</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, if your company could use faster, more productive developers, <a href="mailto:hello+introducing-rv@spinel.coop">let’s talk</a>. We can definitely make that happen.</p><small><p>updated 2025-08-26: <code>uv exec</code> (which doesn’t exist) replaced with <code>uvx</code>, which does exist. thanks <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/xor.blue">@xor.blue</a> and <a href="https://github.com/edmorley">@edmorley</a> for pointing that out.</p></small></div></div>]]></description>

Ruby exploded thanks to Rails, and Python saw a lot of success as a language for data science and a better choice than Perl for command line tools and scripts.</p><p>The two languages were often compared and contrasted, and of course I, as a fan of Ruby, had a lot of opinions about Python.</p></div><h2 id="python-as-a-worse-ruby-and-an-even-worse-scheme">Python as a worse Ruby (and an even worse Scheme)</h2><div><p>I kind of lied earlier when I said that Ruby was my first love as a programmer. The first time I started to really <em>grok</em> programming was when I learned a little bit of Scheme. I learned recursion before<code>for</code> loops, and I learned immutability before mutability.</p><p>As I said in the beginning of this post, I didn’t like Python. My dislike for it was best exemplified by its choice to make <code>if</code> a <em>statement</em> rather than an expression. If you want to assign a variable conditionally in Python you have to <em>declare</em> it first, and then <em>mutate</em> it from inside the <code>if</code> statement, and this just didn’t sit right with me.</p><p>(Yes, you can also use the <code>&lt;then-expression&gt; if &lt;condition&gt; else &lt;else-expression&gt;</code> inline conditional, but that looks weird to me even now.)</p><p><code>lambda</code>s, my bread and butter as a Rubyist and Schemer, are replaced by horrible twisted versions of themselves that don’t allow statements. Even <code>print</code> was a statement before Python 3.0, so you couldn’t use it inside of a <code>lambda</code>. The horror!</p><p>In summary, Python to me just felt <em>unpleasant</em> to use. It’s a language that prides itself on having only one way to do things, and that way was usually not the one I wanted to use.</p></div><h2 id="type-systems-for-the-untypable">Type systems for the untypable</h2><div><p>At some point I found myself writing frontend code. JavaScript is not my favorite language, but TypeScript tried <em>very hard</em> to get me to love it.</p><p>I consider TypeScript to be the gold standard when it comes to type systems on top of dynamic languages. It is powerful enough to model almost all Real World JS, and while this approach introduces a lot of complexity, it also brought the language a lot of success.</p><p>TypeScript does a <em>bit</em> more work than your classic ML (as in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ML_(programming_language)">Meta Language</a>) type system. TypeScript can:</p></div><ul><li><a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/narrowing.html">Narrow</a> a variable’s type based on the return type of a function you call on it!</li><li>Manipulate types by <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/keyof-types.html">destructuring</a> and <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/mapped-types.html">constructing</a> them!</li><li><a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/conditional-types.html">Make choices</a> while constructing a type based on subtyping rules!</li></ul><div><p>The last two features in particular unlock some incredible type-level programming potential. TypeScript is one of the few type systems in which you can <a href="https://github.com/cassiozen/TDungeon">play a text adventure</a> and <a href="https://github.com/codemix/ts-sql">query a database</a>!</p><p>On top of being the most complex (and fun) type system of most languages out there, let alone those topping the TIOBE Index, TypeScript certainly makes JavaScript’s flaws a lot more bearable. It almost made me <em>enjoy</em> writing frontend code for a living.</p></div><h2 id="i-changed">I changed</h2><div><p>One thing I learned while writing TypeScript was that bad language features can be excused by some static analysis. <em>Maybe</em> not having <code>match</code> is ok when you have type narrowing based on control flow and unions. <em>Maybe</em> not having <code>if</code> expressions is ok when you can statically check that a variable was initialized after an <code>if</code> statement. <em>Maybe</em> <a href="https://www.hanselman.com/blog/stringly-typed-vs-strongly-typed">stringly typed</a> variables are ok when you can statically enumerate the magic strings and ensure they are constructed correctly.</p><p>I also started writing quite a bit of Rust, which is a great language to show your functional programmer friends when you want to tell them that mutability is <em>actually fine</em>.</p></div><h2 id="python-changed">Python changed</h2><div><p>Python is not the same language it used to be. Now it supports type hints! And <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#match-statements"><code>match</code> statements</a> with destructuring! Even <code>print</code> got turned into a normal function!</p><p>The type hints are easily my favorite feature. Not only do they provide type information to a good ecosystem of type checkers, but they can also be used by libraries to <a href="https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/">validate schemas</a> and <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/">simplify defining web APIs</a>.</p><p>I think they’re a great case study for integrating types in an existing ecosystem.</p></div><ul><li>They are built into the language, so unlike TypeScript where you need to insert a separate build step, there is no cost of adoption.</li><li>They are orthogonal to type checking and inspectable from within the language, so libraries like Pydantic can leverage them to bring benefits even to users who don’t run a type checker. Everybody wins!</li><li>The aforementioned libraries can serve as a gateway drug into the magical world of types ✨</li></ul><p>And here are some features of Python that I like which are unrelated to types:</p><ul><li>Keyword arguments. You can call any function using the argument names as keywords without any ceremony in the function definition. I wish every language had this feature!</li><li>It has namespaces, which are pretty good.</li><li>The lambdas are bad, but comprehensions and generator functions are neat. They remind me of F#’s sequence expressions.</li><li>Having preferably only one way to do things is a good feature when you’re working with many people on a project.</li></ul><h2 id="ruby-didnt-change">Ruby didn’t change</h2><div><p>So where does that leave Ruby, my former favorite language? Well, Ruby didn’t change as much in the last 10 years. A bunch of performance work to benefit big applications like Rails, a couple of interesting features that didn’t seem to catch on, and a handful of new syntax additions that don’t amount to much. Nothing quite as game-changing as type hints. Matz doesn’t seem to care for them.</p><p>I still use Ruby for some scripts because I know it like the back of my hand, but… it just doesn’t feel the same. I get just a bit more irked by its quirks. I miss features from other languages. I long for keyword arguments, type hints, namespaces, I long for… Python!?</p><p>Maybe this is a sign that I’ve changed too much for Ruby. We had a lot of fun together, but it’s time to leave it behind. Goodbye Ruby, and thanks for all the chunky bacon.</p><p>And to Python I say: good job! You can have one of my midnight chicken nuggets. You deserve it.</p></div></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><header></header><section><p>I’m a big fan of “sharp tools”. These are tools that are powerful enough to be hugely helpful or harmful, depending on how they’re used. Most forms of direct production access are in this category: like ssh or kubectl, or a read-write prod SQL console. It’s also possible to give “dangerous advice”. Dangerous advice is dangerous because (like sharp tools) it takes competence and judgment to use well. Giving the wrong person dangerous advice is like giving the wrong person production SQL access - they might go off and do something enormously destructive with it.</p>
<p>I give a lot of dangerous advice on this blog. For instance, I advise readers to:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.seangoedecke.com/what-is-important">Make your own decisions about what to work on</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.seangoedecke.com/breaking-rules">Deliberately break written company rules sometimes</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.seangoedecke.com/taking-a-position">Take strong positions even when you’re uncertain</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.seangoedecke.com/programmer-archetypes">Identify as a bit of a ‘grifter’</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.seangoedecke.com/how-to-ship">Deliberately avoid all non-shipping activities</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I worry about some readers making the wrong decisions about what to work on, or breaking the rules in the wrong way, and so on. I don’t like the idea that I’ve contributed to harming someone’s career. But I think dangerous advice is important to write down <em>somewhere</em>. </p>
<h3>Most career advice is fake</h3>
<p>The main reason why is that <strong>strong engineers crave dangerous advice</strong>, for the same reason they crave sharp tools. Most career advice is fake: written to avoid liability, or to impress people. If you’re serious about getting things done, you’ll end up doing some of these things because they’re obviously helpful.</p>
<p>It can be deeply alienating to <em>know</em> things don’t work the way they officially should, but to have nobody to talk about it with. When I was a more junior engineer, I really appreciated the few peers I had who were willing to get real with me (off the record).</p>
<h3>Managers can’t tell it to you</h3>
<p>Another reason why is that <strong>managers will almost never give you dangerous advice</strong>, even if it’s what you need to hear. If a manager tells you to ignore company policy, and you do it wrong - for instance, if you post in Slack that you’re doing it and your manager said it was OK - then that’s bad for them. In fact, it’s much worse for them than it is for you. Tech company leadership often views engineers as useful idiots. Managers are expected to be professionals.</p>
<p>However, lots of managers wish they could give you advice like this. They certainly appreciate it when you follow it. I’ve never been a manager, but it must be incredibly frustrating to manage strong engineers who would be much more effective if they approached work a little more tactically (and a little less according to the written job description).</p>
<p>Dangerous advice requires courage to follow. It’s very high-risk, high-reward, and is thus disproportionately useful to strong engineers (and harmful to weaker ones). If you don’t feel comfortable following it, you definitely shouldn’t. But if you’re already operating like this sometimes and wondering whether you’re making some horrible long-term mistake, I don’t think so. Or if you are, I’m making it too!</p></section><p>If you liked this post, consider <a href="https://buttondown.com/seangoedecke" target="_blank">subscribing</a> to email updates about my new posts, or <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/submitlink?u=https://www.seangoedecke.com/dangerous-advice/&amp;t=Dangerous%20advice%20for%20software%20engineers" target="_blank">sharing it on Hacker News</a>.</p><p>April 5, 2025<!-- -->&nbsp;│ Tags: <a href="https://www.seangoedecke.com/tags/good%20engineers/">good engineers</a>, <a href="https://www.seangoedecke.com/tags/tech%20companies/">tech companies</a></p><hr></article></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main">
        
<p>One of my pet peeves is when command-line tools look for user configuration
files in <code>~/Library/Application Support</code> when running on macOS. In addition to
offering poor ergonomics for users, I believe this behavior is <em>incorrect</em>
according to the documentation which is cited to justify it. Instead,
command-line tools should implement the <a href="https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/latest/">XDG Base Directory Specification</a>
and look for configuration files in <code>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME</code>, which defaults to
<code>~/.config</code>.</p>
<p>Usually, when a program looks for configuration files in <code>~/Library/Application Support</code>, it’s not because of an intentional design decision. Instead, the
author delegated that decision to a library, and several popular libraries for
determining platform-specific configuration directories use
<code>~/Library/Application Support</code> as the default configuration directory on
macOS, including <a href="https://pypi.org/project/platformdirs/">Python’s <code>platformdirs</code> package</a> (<a href="https://pypistats.org/packages/platformdirs">242
million downloads / month</a>), <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/env-paths">JavaScript’s
<code>env-paths</code></a> (95 million downloads / month), <a href="https://lib.rs/crates/dirs">Rust’s <code>dirs</code>
crate</a> (4.8 million downloads / month), and <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/adrg/xdg">Go’s <code>adrg/xdg</code>
package</a> (used in 913 packages). While <code>~/Library/Application Support</code>
may be the correct configuration directory for <em>GUI apps</em> which manage their
configuration files for the user automatically, the vast majority of
applications using these libraries are command-line utilities whose
configuration belongs in <code>~/.config</code>.</p>
<p>The main reason I dislike programs looking for dotfiles in
<code>~/Library/Application Support</code> is that it’s <em>unexpected.</em> As <a href="https://github.com/nushell/nushell/issues/893#issuecomment-1736736555">Ashlin Eldridge
explained on GitHub</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a new user, it’s extremely surprising to me to that a modern tool like
<code>nu</code> would put config files under Application Support on macOS. It’s even
more surprising to see that some people are
<a href="https://github.com/nushell/nushell/discussions/5279">actively</a>
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33425312">against</a> adopting the XDG
standard.</p>
<p>The origins of XDG no longer matter at this point. No one really cares what
the X, D, and G stand for. The fact is that
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.jp/index.php/XDG_Base_Directory">hundreds</a> of tools
support it (including Git, Emacs, Neovim, Tmux) and users have come to expect
support for it. It’s the closest thing we have to a standard that allows
users to control the placement of their config files (which facilitates
users’ ability to source control their files) and it also includes support
for files that shouldn’t be source controlled such as cache and data files.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If a user explains that they found a program’s behavior surprising, many
engineers will respond by telling the user that their expectations were wrong.
However, I find that the reason users form an incorrect mental model of a
program’s behavior is usually because the program’s design violated an
established convention from some broader context. In accordance with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment">the
Principle of Least Astonishment</a>, I prefer to change the program to
behave how users expect rather than futilely attempt to change what users
expect.</p>
<p>Users expect macOS CLI tools to look for configuration files in <code>~/.config</code> is
because <strong>that’s what almost every other program does.</strong> Your program should
probably not disagree with Bash and Vim and Git about where configuration files
are supposed to go!</p>
<p>These conventions help us explore unfamiliar systems by letting us apply
knowledge about one part of the system to other parts of the system.
Consistency is predictability. When every tool works the same except for a
small handful, users get justifiably annoyed at the exceptions for wasting
their time.</p>
<h2 id="what-do-dotfile-managers-do"><a href="#what-do-dotfile-managers-do" aria-label="Link to section what-do-dotfile-managers-do">#</a>What do dotfile managers do?</h2>
<p>Many engineers use (or maintain) some sort of dotfile manager to handle
tracking these configuration files. If configuration files are really supposed
to go in <code>~/Library/Application Support</code>, we would expect dotfile managers to
put configuration files there by default when running on macOS. After all, the
whole point of a dotfile manager is to simplify managing configuration files
across multiple machines and platforms. Let’s take a quick survey to see how
some popular dotfile managers behave on macOS:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.chezmoi.io/">chezmoi</a> (14.3k stars) makes no effort to link
configuration to <code>~/Library/Application Support</code>, despite including
<a href="https://www.chezmoi.io/user-guide/machines/macos/">documentation for using chezmoi on macOS
specifically</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot">dotbot</a> (7.3k stars) ignores
<code>~/Library/Application Support</code>. Despite including macOS-specific
configuration files in the examples, the README shows a configuration for VS
Code that will be completely ignored on macOS.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/yadm-dev/yadm">yadm</a> (5.5k stars) makes no effort to
support <code>~/Library/Application Support</code>. The example configurations include
macOS-specific portions but also do not reference <code>~/Library/Application Support</code>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm">rcm</a> (3.2k stars) makes no effort to
support <code>~/Library/Application Support</code>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/">GNU Stow</a> makes (unsurprisingly) no
effort to support <code>~/Library/Application Support</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of these tools are <em>able</em> to link configuration files to
<code>~/Library/Application Support</code> if you ask them to explicitly (although macOS
will regularly replace your symlinks with copies of the destination files), but
the fact that they don’t bother to do so by default is revealing. Users only
want this behavior for specific misbehaving programs.</p>
<h2 id="an-appeal-to-logic"><a href="#an-appeal-to-logic" aria-label="Link to section an-appeal-to-logic">#</a>An appeal to logic</h2>
<p>Perhaps “consistency” isn’t a good enough reason for you to place your
program’s configuration files in <code>~/.config</code> like everybody else. Maybe you
think that programs should follow the platform guidelines, even if they don’t
match developer expectations. <a href="https://github.com/dirs-dev/directories-rs/issues/47#issuecomment-478337412">@soc on GitHub</a> phrases it like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a general advice for macOS devs: If you are developing on their platform,
do what the platform owners tell you. They are the lords, you are the
share-croppers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Elsewhere, <a href="https://github.com/nushell/nushell/issues/12103#issuecomment-1982144513">Reilly Wood rebukes</a> a user asking if there would “be any
downside to just not using <code>Application Support</code> ever” by saying that “[Nushell
would] no longer be following the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/FileManagement/Conceptual/FileSystemProgrammingGuide/FileSystemOverview/FileSystemOverview.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40010672-CH2-SW6">macOS Standard Directories
guidelines</a>.”</p>
<p>We’ll read through those guidelines in a minute, but it’s not entirely clear to
me that they’re relevant in the first place. The <a href="https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/latest/">XDG Base Directory
Specification</a> mentions Unix a few times but lists no carveouts for macOS
or any other operating system. If <code>~/.config</code> is accepted as the standard
location for configuration files on Unix-like operating systems, then surely it
would be the standard location on macOS as well, given that macOS is a Unix by
way of BSD.</p>
<p>But suppose we accept that the XDG specification only applies to <em>some</em> Unix
operating systems, despite making no mention of this. The <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/FileManagement/Conceptual/FileSystemProgrammingGuide/FileSystemOverview/FileSystemOverview.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40010672-CH2-SW6">macOS Standard
Directories</a> documentation starts by stating that
“[w]hether provided by the system or created by your app, every file has its
place in macOS”, and honestly we could stop reading right there, because <strong>a
command-line tool is not the system or an app.</strong></p>
<p>While this might seem like a pedantic nitpick, in reality it’s <em>critical</em> to
correctly interpreting this documentation! I suspect that many of the
developers who cite these guidelines do not know very much about macOS and
think that “app” is just what macOS calls executables, but that’s not true. A
couple screens down, the same page says that <code>/bin</code> “[c]ontains essential
command-line binaries”, so we can be sure the authors aren’t conflating apps
and command-line tools. Apps on macOS are installed in <code>/Applications</code> and are
subject to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/preparing-your-app-for-distribution">a number of additional requirements</a>, from a bundle ID
(a unique reverse-DNS identifier for an app, like <code>com.apple.Preview</code> for
<code>Preview.app</code>) to application icons, launch screens, code signing,
notarization, app sandboxing, and runtime hardening. Needless to say, none of
the developers shipping command-line utilities are following any of <em>these</em>
guidelines.</p>
<p>Moving on, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/FileManagement/Conceptual/FileSystemProgrammingGuide/MacOSXDirectories/MacOSXDirectories.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40010672-CH10-SW1">the documentation for <code>~/Library/Application Support</code></a> says that it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Contains all app-specific data and support files. These are the files that
your app creates and manages on behalf of the user and can include files that
contain user data.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, command-line tools do not have <em>any</em> app-specific data because they are
not apps. Further, dotfiles are usually written by hand and not managed <em>on
behalf of</em> the user.</p>
<p>The next paragraph makes it very clear that <code>~/Library/Application Support</code> is
for apps only:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By convention, all of these items should be put in a subdirectory whose name
matches the bundle identifier of the app. For example, if your app is named
<code>MyApp</code> and has the bundle identifier <code>com.example.MyApp</code>, you would put your
app’s user-specific data files and resources in the <code>~/Library/Application Support/com.example.MyApp/</code> directory. Your app is responsible for creating
this directory as needed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Command-line tools do not have a bundle identifier, including many command-line
tools shipped with macOS by Apple (such as <code>ls</code> or <code>vim</code>). And even though
<a href="https://git.lix.systems/lix-project/lix/issues/515">Apple feels very comfortable shipping command-line tools that behave in a
subtly different manner from their equivalents on other modern Unix-descendent
operating systems,</a> the macOS variants of <code>bash</code>, <code>zsh</code>, <code>git</code>, and
<code>vim</code> all look for their configuration files in the same place: <code>~/.config</code>.
Unless your tool is installed in <code>/Applications</code>, there’s no reason for its
configuration to live in <code>~/Library/Application Support</code>.</p>
<h2 id="when-should-you-use-library-application-support"><a href="#when-should-you-use-library-application-support" aria-label="Link to section when-should-you-use-library-application-support">#</a>When <em>should</em> you use <code>~/Library/Application Support</code></h2>
<p>With the guidelines and conventions listed above in mind, your application
should store its configuration files in <code>~/Library/Application Support</code> instead
of <code>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME</code> if both of the following conditions apply:</p>
<ol>
<li>It is a GUI application installed in <code>/Applications</code> or <code>~/Applications</code>.</li>
<li>It manages its configuration files automatically on behalf of the user,
rather than expecting the user to write their configuration in a text file
themself.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="tl-dr"><a href="#tl-dr" aria-label="Link to section tl-dr">#</a>TL;DR</h2>
<p>Users do not expect command-line tools to look for configuration files in
<code>~/Library/Application Support</code> on macOS. Dotfile managers do not place
configuration files in <code>~/Library/Application Support</code> on macOS. The most
commonly-cited justifications for placing configuration files in
<code>~/Library/Application Support</code> are not meant to apply to command-line tools at
all. Even command-line tools like <code>bash</code> and <code>git</code> shipped by Apple look for
their configuration files in <code>~/.config</code>.</p>
<p>Please, please, <em>please</em> just use the <a href="https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/latest/">XDG Base Directory Specification</a>.</p>

<p>This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-4De-zNTT4">minute-long clip of a Will Smith concert</a> is blowing up online for all the wrong reasons, with people accusing him of using AI to generate fake crowds filled with fake fans carrying fake signs. The story’s blown up a bit, with coverage in <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/will-smith-ai-crowd-tour-video-1235415353/">Rolling Stone</a>, <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/will-smith-accused-of-creating-ai-fans-in-new-tour-video-3887232">NME</a>, <a href="https://www.the-independent.com/arts-entertainment/music/news/will-smith-tour-video-ai-crowd-fans-signs-b2813526.html">The Independent</a>, and <a href="https://consequence.net/2025/08/will-smith-ai-crowds-video/">Consequence of Sound</a>.</p>

<p>And it definitely looks terrible! The faces have all the characteristics of AI slop, with familiar artifacts like uncanny features, smeared faces, multiple fingers/limbs, and nonsensical signage. “From West Philly to West Swig̴̙̕g̷̤̔͜y”?</p>



<figure><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/will_smith_slop-1024x576.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/will_smith_slop-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/will_smith_slop-300x169.jpg 300w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/will_smith_slop-768x432.jpg 768w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/will_smith_slop-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/will_smith_slop-2048x1152.jpg 2048w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/will_smith_slop-800x450.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>It gets worse the more you look at it.</figcaption></figure>



<p>But here’s where things get complicated.</p>



<p><strong>The crowds are real. </strong>Every person you see in the video above started out as real footage of real fans, pulled from video of multiple Will Smith concerts during his recent European tour.</p>







<p>The main Will Smith performance footage in the clip is from the Positiv Festival, held last month at the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DMx76OzMdxO/">Théâtre Antique d’Orange</a> in Orange, France. (Here’s a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZLQ-fARByI">phone recording</a> from the audience of the first half of the performance.) It’s intercut with various shots of audiences from Gurtenfestival and Paléo in Switzerland, the Ronquieres Festival in Belgium, among others.</p>



<p>From this <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DMfgAkXRSyF/">slideshow of photos</a> from the Paléo festival in Nyon, Switzerland, you can see professionally-shot photos of the same audience from the video. </p>



<p>The signs, previously distorted, can now be read, like this one which actually reads “From West Philly to West Swizzy.” (Short for Switzerland, if you’re wondering.)</p>

<p>One of the most egregious examples is the couple holding the sign thanking Will Smith for helping them survive cancer which — <em>if it was AI-generated slop</em> — would be pretty disgusting: a gross attempt to drum up sympathy with fake people.</p>



<p>In an <a href="https://www.the-independent.com/arts-entertainment/music/news/will-smith-tour-video-ai-crowd-fans-signs-b2813526.html">article</a> posted by <em>The Independent</em> today, music editor Roisin O’Connor points to the couple as clear evidence of AI generation: </p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Another shot shows a man’s knuckle appear to blur along with his sign, which reads ‘You Can Make It’ helped me survive cancer. THX Will.’ Meanwhile, the woman in front of him is seemingly holding his hand, but the headband of the woman behind her is somehow over her wrist.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p><strong>But the couple is real</strong>. There’s two good photos of them on Will Smith’s Instagram in a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DMVPEtPscFM/?img_index=5">slideshow</a> of photos and videos from Gurtenfestival in Bern last month.</p>

<p>You can see them in this video from <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DMT6bldoD2G/">Will Smith’s Instagram post</a>, which I clipped below.</p>

<h2>Two Levels of AI Enhancement</h2>



<p>So if these fans aren’t AI-generated fakes, what’s going on here?</p>



<p>The video features real performances and real audiences, but I believe they were manipulated on two levels:</p>



<ol>
<li>Will Smith’s team generated several short AI image-to-video clips from professionally-shot audience photos</li>



<li>YouTube post-processed the resulting Shorts montage, making everything look so much worse</li>
</ol>



<p>Let’s start with YouTube.</p>



<h2>YouTube’s Shorts “Experiment”</h2>



<p>Will Smith’s team also uploaded this same video to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DNQsphpxgrg/">Instagram</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/reel/739450732135683">Facebook</a>, where it looks <em>considerably</em> better than the copy on YouTube, without the smeary sheen of uncanny detail.</p>



<p>I put them side-by-side below. Try going full-screen and pause at any point to see the difference. The Instagram footage is noticeably better throughout, though some of the audience clips still have issues.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>For the last <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2025/08/youtube-shorts-ai-upscaling/683946/">two months</a>, it turns out that YouTube was quietly experimenting with post-processing YouTube Shorts videos: unblurring and denoising videos with often-unpleasant results.</p>



<p>I first heard about this ten days ago, when guitarist Rhett Shull <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86nhP8tvbLY">posted a great video</a> about the issue, which now has over 700k views.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Five days ago, YouTube finally confirmed it was happening. YouTube’s Creator Liaison Rene Ritchie <a href="https://twitter.com/YouTubeInsider/status/1958199532363317467">posted on X</a> about the experiment.</p>



<figure><a href="https://twitter.com/YouTubeInsider/status/1958199532363317467"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="721" src="https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-15-1024x721.png" alt="" srcset="https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-15-1024x721.png 1024w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-15-300x211.png 300w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-15-768x541.png 768w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-15-800x563.png 800w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-15.png 1298w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<blockquote>
<div><p>In a <a href="https://twitter.com/YouTubeInsider/status/1958241868736815311">followup reply</a>, Ritchie clarified the difference, as he saw it:</p><p>GenAI typically refers to technologies like transformers and large language models, which are relatively new. Upscaling typically refers to taking one resolution (like SD/480p) and making it look good at a higher resolution (like HD/1080p). This isn’t using GenAI or doing any upscaling. It’s using the kind of machine learning you experience with computational photography on smartphones, for example, and it’s not changing the resolution.</p></div>
</blockquote>



<p>On Friday, Alex Reisner wrote about “<a href="https://archive.is/JjXn9#selection-581.0-586.0">YouTube’s Sneaky AI ‘Experiment’</a>” in <em>The Atlantic</em>, and got another official statement from Google:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>When I asked Google, YouTube’s parent company, about what’s happening to these videos, the spokesperson Allison Toh wrote, “We’re running an experiment on select YouTube Shorts that uses image enhancement technology to sharpen content. These enhancements are not done with generative AI.” But this is a tricky statement: “Generative AI” has no strict technical definition, and “image enhancement technology” could be anything. I asked for more detail about which technologies are being employed, and to what end. Toh said YouTube is “using traditional machine learning to unblur, denoise, and improve clarity in videos,” she told me.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>I agree with Reisner that it’s likely that a diffusion model is at work here and Google is trying to split hairs over the definition of “generative AI” because of how divisive it is. </p>



<h2>Will Smith’s Generated Videos</h2>



<p>That explains why the entire YouTube Shorts video has that smeary look to it that isn’t present throughout the copy posted on Instagram, but <em>both</em> versions have those terrible audience shots with AI artifacts and garbled signage.</p>



<p>After looking at it, I believe that Will Smith’s team was using a generative video model, but not to create entirely new audience footage, like most people suspect.</p>



<p>Instead, they started with photos shot by their official tour photographers, and used those photos in <a href="https://academy.runwayml.com/gen4/gen4-image-to-video">Runway</a>, <a href="https://developers.googleblog.com/en/veo-3-fast-image-to-video-capabilities-now-available-gemini-api/">Veo 3</a>, or a similar image-to-video model to create a short animated clip suitable for a concert montage.</p>



<p>Let’s go back to the crowd photo from Paléo in Switzerland:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="768" height="1024" src="https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-16-768x1024.png" alt="" srcset="https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-16-768x1024.png 768w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-16-225x300.png 225w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-16-1152x1536.png 1152w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-16-800x1067.png 800w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-16.png 1440w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"></figure>



<p>I believe this is the <strong><em>exact</em></strong> photo that the crowd shot in the video was generated with. Here it is as a two-frame animation, with the first frame from the AI video overlaid on the original photo.</p>



<figure><video autoplay="" loop="" muted="" src="https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/will_smith_comparison_animation.mp4"></video></figure>



<p>Here’s another example. The photo below was taken at Ronquieres Festival in Belgium, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DNBJHKmx75j/?img_index=14">posted to Will Smith’s</a> Instagram three weeks ago.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="819" height="1024" src="https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-17-819x1024.png" alt="" srcset="https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-17-819x1024.png 819w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-17-240x300.png 240w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-17-768x960.png 768w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-17-800x1000.png 800w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-17.png 1080w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 819px) 100vw, 819px"></figure>



<p>And here’s the AI-generated clip that it was turned into.</p>



<figure><video autoplay="" loop="" controls="" src="https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fresh_prince.mp4"></video></figure>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Virtually all of the commenters on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-4De-zNTT4">YouTube</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=%22will+smith%22+ai&amp;type=posts&amp;sort=top&amp;t=week">Reddit</a>, and X believe this was fake footage of fake fans, generated by Will Smith’s team to prop up a lackluster tour. </p>



<p>Like the faces in the video, the truth is blurry. </p>



<p>The crowds were real, but the videos were manipulated: first by Will Smith’s team, and then without asking, by YouTube.</p>



<p>We can debate the ethics of using an image-to-video model to animate photos in this way, but I think it’s meaningfully different than what most people were accusing Will Smith of doing here: using generative AI video to fake a sold-out crowd of passionate fans.</p>
