            <h4>Jan 27,2026</h4>
            <h2>Xfwl4 - The roadmap for a Xfce Wayland Compositor</h2>

            <p>We, the Xfce team are excited to share some great news!</p>

            <p>After careful consideration, we’ve decided on a meaningful way to use the generous donations from our community: funding longtime Xfce core developer <a href="https://gitlab.xfce.org/kelnos" target="_blank">Brian Tarricone</a> to create xfwl4, a brand-new Wayland compositor for Xfce.</p>

            <p>This initiative will utilize a significant portion of the project’s donated funds, but we believe it’s an important investment in Xfce’s future.</p>
 
            <p>The goal is, that xfwl4 will offer the same functionality and behavior as xfwm4 does, or as much as possible considering the differences between X11 and Wayland. Using xfwl4 should feel just like using xfwm4 on X11. We even plan to reuse the existing xfwm4 configuration dialogs and xfconf settings to ensure a seamless transition.</p>

            <p>Xfwl4 will not be based on the existing xfwm4 code. Instead, it will be written from scratch in rust, using <a href="https://github.com/Smithay/smithay/" target="_blank">smithay</a> building blocks.</p>

            <h3>Why doing a rewrite?</h3>

            <p>The first attempt at creating an Xfce Wayland compositor involved modifying the existing xfwm4 code to support both X11 and Wayland in parallel. However, this approach turned out to be the wrong path forward for several reasons:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Xfwm4 is architected in a way that makes it very difficult to put the window management behavior behind generic interfaces that don't include X11 specifics.</li>
              <li>Refactoring Xfwm4 is risky, since it might introduce new bugs to X11. Having two parallel code bases will allow for rapid development and experimentation with the Wayland compositor, with zero risk to break xfwm4.</li>
              <li>Some X11 window management concepts just aren't available or supported by Wayland protocols at this time, and dealing with those differences can be difficult in an X11-first code base.</li>
              <li>Using the existing codebase would require us to use C and wlroots, even if a better alternative is available.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Why to base xfwl4 on smithay?</h3>

            <p>Once the decision to write a compositor from scratch was done, the next major question was: Which Wayland support library to use as a base? In order to find an answer on that question Brian evaluated wlroots and smithay. The decision to use smithay as a base was done for the following reasons:</p>
            <ul>            
              <li>smithay supports most/all official Wayland protocol extensions, as well as the wlroots protocols and some KDE protocols.</li>
              <li>smithay has no high level abstraction, as wlroots has. However, it allows for very deep customization of the graphics and input pipeline, as well as all aspects of Wayland protocol and desktop/shell handling.</li>
              <li>smithay has great documentation.</li>
              <li>Using rust makes it easier to avoid memory related bugs and decreases the chances of crashes, something that should never happen for a Wayland compositor.</li>
              <li>Rather subjective: Brian has a strong preference to write code in rust over writing code in C.</li>
              <li>wlroots is written in C, in a way which makes it very difficult to write <a href="https://way-cooler.org/blog/2019/04/29/rewriting-way-cooler-in-c.html" target="_blank">wlroots rust bindings</a>.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Scope of the project</h3>

            <p>Besides getting feature parity with xfwm4, the xfwl4 project scope includes as well some other related tasks:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Major changes to session-startup will be required, since on Wayland the compositor has to be the root of the session instead of xfce4-session.</li>
              <li>Support for the xdg-session-management protocol is another goal.</li>
              <li>As well support for XWayland is part of the roadmap.</li>
              <li>The build system of the Xfce CI container will need to be upgraded in order to support building rust code via meson.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Brian has already started work on the project, so stay tuned for the first development release of xfwl4, which we hope to share around mid-year.</p>

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi called the pact "historic".</p><p>It will allow free trade of goods between the bloc of 27 European states and the world's most populous country, which together make up nearly 25% of global gross domestic product and a market of two billion people.</p><p>The deal will see a number of huge tariff cuts across a range of goods and services, and a joint security partnership.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Von der Leyen and European Council President António Costa are in Delhi, where they met Modi at a bilateral summit.</p><p>The European Commission said  would eliminate tariffs on most exports of chemicals, machinery and electrical equipment, as well as aircraft and spacecraft, following phased reductions. Significantly, duties on motor vehicles, currently as high as 110%, would be cut to 10% under a quota of 250,000 vehicles. That is six times larger than the 37,000-unit quota India granted to the UK in a deal signed last July.</p><p>India will also cut tariffs on wine, beer and olive oil from the EU. Brussels said the agreement would support investment flows, improve access to European markets and deepen supply-chain integration.</p><p>Delhi said almost all of its exports would get "preferential access" into the EU, with textiles, leather, marine products, handicrafts, gems and jewellery set to see a reduction or elimination of tariffs.</p><p>While commodities such as tea, coffee, spices and processed foods will benefit from the agreement, Delhi "has prudently safeguarded sensitive sectors, including dairy, cereals, poultry, soy meal, certain fruits and vegetables, balancing export growth with domestic priorities", it said.</p><p>Delhi and Brussels have also agreed on a mobility framework that eases restrictions for professionals to travel between India and the EU in the short term. </p><p>"This is India's biggest free trade agreement," Modi said. "It will make access to European markets easier for India's farmers and small business. It will also boost manufacturing and services sectors. It will boost innovative partnerships."</p><p>The trade deal comes as both India and the EU contend with economic and geopolitical pressure from the US. </p><p>Delhi is grappling with 50% tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump last year amid talks aimed at securing a trade deal between India and the US that are still  dragging on.</p><p>Last week, Trump threatened to escalate his trade war with European allies for opposing a US takeover of Greenland, before <a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgezx40r7d7o">backing off</a>. </p><p>That larger geopolitical context was evident in statements made by leaders.</p><p>On Tuesday, von der Leyen said: "This is the tale of two giants - the world's second and fourth largest economies. Two giants which chose partnership in a true win-win fashion. A strong message that co-operation is the best answer to global challenges."</p><p>A day before that Costa had <a target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-eu-trade-pact-to-be-very-important-geopolitical-stabiliser-antonio-costa-101769440061733.html">said</a>, without naming the US, that the trade deal would send an "important political message to the world that India and the EU believe more in trade agreements than in tariffs".</p></div><figure><div data-component="image-block"><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png" aria-label="image unavailable"><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/eff1/live/e41a92a0-fb44-11f0-a0e0-496c391d5d58.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/eff1/live/e41a92a0-fb44-11f0-a0e0-496c391d5d58.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/eff1/live/e41a92a0-fb44-11f0-a0e0-496c391d5d58.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/eff1/live/e41a92a0-fb44-11f0-a0e0-496c391d5d58.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/eff1/live/e41a92a0-fb44-11f0-a0e0-496c391d5d58.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/eff1/live/e41a92a0-fb44-11f0-a0e0-496c391d5d58.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/eff1/live/e41a92a0-fb44-11f0-a0e0-496c391d5d58.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/eff1/live/e41a92a0-fb44-11f0-a0e0-496c391d5d58.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Narendra Modi/X Leaders stand in a line on a decorated stage at an outdoor ceremony.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p><em>Update: This post generated a <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/bpqtph/state_linux_music_players_2026">thread on lobste.rs</a> with some more recommendations and thoughts from the friendly folks over there!</em></p>
<p>If you haven’t heard yet, in big 2026 we’re all ditching <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/artificial-intelligence/microslop-trends-on-social-media-backlash-to-microsofts-on-going-ai-obsession-continues">Microslop</a> for systems that actually respect you, and we’re also breaking up with our <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/862465/spotify-premium-us-price-increase-2026">ever-pricier Spotify subscriptions</a> in exchange for actual ownership of the media we consume. So, for Fun February, I thought I’d take a look at some of the apps we can use to fill the Spotify-shaped void.</p>
<h2 id="the-manifesto-which-you-can-skip-if-you-do-not-care-about-the-self-righteous-linux-user-rant">The manifesto, which you can skip if you do not care about the self-righteous Linux user rant</h2>
<p>At this point, I strongly believe even straight up piracy is better for artists than streaming. At least looking up your favorite artist on Soulseek doesn’t pop up a dozen ads and two AI-generated ripoffs that Spotify would rather you listen to as they profit more from them.</p>
<p>But copyright infringement is only good when multi-trillion-dollar corporations do it to feed their LLMs. Us peasants are still bound by regular laws. So do not Google “life of a showgirl torrent safe no virus”. Instead, you can just… buy music for cheap.</p>
<p>The never-ending vinyl trend cratered prices of CDs, and even new releases can be found for under 10€, with older ones available for half that, especially if you look up sales. If you aren’t too bothered by a lossy format, iTunes - yes, that iTunes, the Apple one - will sell you DRM-free music on release day just like in the good old days. Finally, most music that’s not released on a major label finds its way to Bandcamp, which is another venue for lossless DRM-free music.</p>
<p>Of course, we’re not living in the stone ages anymore, so no one expects you to carry your Discman or iPod around. It takes whole of five minutes to pop a CD into a cheap drive and rip high-quality FLACs onto your drive, which you can then stream from wherever you are in the world. Yes, this advanced technology that took Spotify almost two full decades to figure out can be yours in just a few simple steps through servers like <a href="https://jellyfin.org/">Jellyfin</a> or <a href="https://github.com/navidrome/navidrome">Navidrome</a> running on your own hardware.</p>
<p>You might say that owning is more expensive than renting, even with all the price increases. Sure. But I’ve paid for Spotify for ten years, from 2014 to 2024, and that’s a solid 1200€ with the old pricing. At the end, I had nothing to show for it. My carefully curated “library” was not mine - it was held hostage by a company that can up the prices at any point. If I stop paying, it’s all gone. And it’s not like the artists profited from that exchange either - one purchase of an album easily pays them more than a thousand streams, and realistically I do not stream most albums a thousand times.</p>
<p>At a time when copyright, and laws in general, only seem to apply selectively, I would rather directly support the artists whose work I enjoy and who need it. And for the rest… well, Taylor already got my right kidney for the Eras tour tickets. I’m sure she won’t mind if I give Opalite a few spins without selling my left one too.</p>
<h2 id="the-competition">The competition</h2>
<p>Anyway, with that out of the way, I wanted to take a look at the state of Linux music players in the current year. I went to  <code>nixpkgs</code> and searched for “music player”<sup id="fr-1-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>, which gave me about 200 results. Then I narrowed it down to a handful of actual desktop music players that are also not streaming services.</p>
<p>I looked for features that I would expect to find in an average streaming app:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Appearance:</strong> Modern, intuitive user interface. Looks like a desktop app, and not a blown-up phone app. Designed for human use (no CLIs). Celebrates music as an art form (doesn’t look like an Excel spreadsheet).</li>
<li><strong>Native:</strong> Respects common protocols - I can run it in the background, control the player with keyboard shortcuts, and it shows up in my shell as a music player.</li>
<li><strong>Performance:</strong> Snappy navigation. Works reasonably well with a moderately sized music library.</li>
<li><strong>Features:</strong> Has a concept of a “music library”. Fast, quality search. Playlists and play queues are easy to access and control. Respects existing metadata, doesn’t mess up my files by enforcing its own scheme.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following is by no means an exhaustive list of Linux music players, but I think it covers a nice range and hope it helps someone discover something new. I also tried to surface only the apps I either thought were good or had a lot of potential - if I thought something was downright bad or if it didn’t work I just skipped over it, as all of these apps are free and open source and someone, somewhere put at least some effort into them.</p>
<h2 id="amberol">Amberol</h2>
<p><a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/amberol">Amberol</a> is “a small and simple sound and music player that is well integrated with GNOME.”</p>
<p>This barely fits my criteria for features. But you know what? I kinda like it! Super minimal, no library management (beyond restoring your previous playlist when you load it up), but what it does, it does great. The waveform on the scrubber is a very nice touch. Looks great for very casual listeners, or maybe as your default app when opening an audio file.</p>
<p><img src="https://crescentro.se/posts/linux-music-players-2026/amberol.png" alt="screenshot of Amberol" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></p>
<h2 id="">Euphonica</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/htkhiem/euphonica">Euphonica</a> is an “MPD client with delusions of grandeur”. To set up Euphonica you will also need to set up MPD, which is not tragically difficult, and you might even prefer it over a bespoke library isolated to a specific app.</p>
<p>Euphonica has been my daily driver before I embarked on this journey, and it’s fairly straightforward with a few flourishes on top. You have your album and artist pages, a queue, playlists, and nice extras like synced lyrics. I also think it’s the prettiest one in the list - there’s <em>just enough</em> flair to the UI that it seems like it’s “glowing”, the album art is given ample space as it deserves, and the (optional) background visualizer is very tastefully implemented.</p>
<p>It’s not without its quirks. The UI chokes a bit with large collections, and despite my best efforts I’m unable to get photos for any artist except ABBA for some reason (maybe the developer is Swedish?). I also wish it had a song search function, more sorting options, and that re-ordering the queue could be done with drag and drop rather than buttons. My biggest complaint, however, is that changing the volume requires using my scroll wheel on the volume knob. At least let me click and move it up and down.</p>
<p><img src="https://crescentro.se/posts/linux-music-players-2026/euphonica.png" alt="screenshot of Euphonica" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></p>
<h2 id="-1">Feishin</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/jeffvli/feishin">Feishin</a> is “a modern self-hosted music player”. You will need a music server of some description: Jellyfin, Navidrome and Subsonic are supported.</p>
<p>Feishin is by far the most feature-complete player on this list. If you want your “personal Spotify”, this is it. The user interface is very customizable, there’s not just search but a <em>goddamn command palette</em> for easy keyboard navigation, and the entire experience is very reminiscent of what you’d get from a streaming service if it cared for the user rather than the shareholders. This includes recommendations (from your own library), highlights, statistics and other fun stuff. Sure, a lot of it is powered by Jellyfin itself, but Feishin presents it in a coherent, understandable and friendly manner.</p>
<p>Not everything is perfect. Since Feishin is an Electron app that talks to your (potentially remote) music server, there are some obvious web-isms, like the in-app notifications and spinners while content loads, as well as the icky feeling of running yet another Chrome instance. You also depend on the Electron audio stack. However, those rough edges are generally minor, the important stuff works well, and the entire package is absolutely worth your try.</p>
<p><img src="https://crescentro.se/posts/linux-music-players-2026/feishin.png" alt="screenshot of Feishin" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></p>
<h2 id="-2">Lollypop</h2>
<p><a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/lollypop">Lollypop</a> is “a new GNOME music playing application”.</p>
<p>I really want to like this app. The album of the day feature is very cool - a small, simple, but thoughtful feature (even if it did try to get me to listen to Weezer’s Blue Album - not today, Satan!). I like that it opens up on the “suggestions” page instead of an alphabetical list of Everything. It supports YouTube music playback. Someone clearly cares about this a lot.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the user experience is painful. The onboarding flow that gives no indication of the next step, the hidden sidebar that magically appears when you resize the window, the fact that you need to click the “plus” button next to the “Reset collection” label in the settings to add a directory to your library (and yes, I understand that ‘Reset collection’ is a button in its own right, but it only looks like a button if you hover over it), the location of the queue (hidden in the “Playing albums” item in the sidebar)…</p>
<p>I get that these might be GNOME-isms, but they are <strong>bad</strong> GNOME-isms. You absolutely <strong>can</strong> make a good app with GTK4 that looks like it belongs on the GNOME desktop. You just need to ignore everything the GNOME developers tell you to do. Be brave! I believe in you, Lollypop!</p>
<p><img src="https://crescentro.se/posts/linux-music-players-2026/lollypop2.png" alt="screenshot of Lollypop" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></p>
<h2 id="-3">Plattenalbum</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/SoongNoonien/plattenalbum">Plattenalbum</a> is an album-focused MPD client. “Browse your collection while viewing large album covers. Play your music without managing playlists”. As with the previous MPD client, you will need to bring your own MPD.</p>
<p>Plattenalbum is kinda like Amberol if you strapped basic library search on top of it. If you want to occasionally listen to a full album and you generally know what you want, it’s going to get you there. The UI is pretty clean and minimal, although (another GNOME-ism) what you see is what you get - there are barely any customization options to speak of.</p>
<p>I want to like this concept - it’s reminiscent of the <a href="https://longplay.rocks/">Longplay app</a> which is an album-focused Apple Music client for iOS and the Mac. But Plattenalbum falls a bit short. You cannot even see a list of <em>all</em> albums in your library or sort by anything except the weird ‘Lastname, Firstname unless it’s a band then Sorta Alphabetically unless the name starts with “The” or “A”’. There’s also no support for multi-disc releases. I think there’s a lot of potential here, and I hope it gets realized over time.</p>
<p><img src="https://crescentro.se/posts/linux-music-players-2026/plattenalbum.png" alt="screenshot of Plattenalbum" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></p>
<h2 id="-4">Recordbox</h2>
<p><a href="https://codeberg.org/edestcroix/Recordbox">Recordbox</a> is “yet another music player for Linux, built with GTK and Libadwaita for the GNOME desktop”.</p>
<p>Recordbox had the best onboarding experience by far of any app on this list - click the prominent button, choose your music directory, wait for the obvious progress indicator to fill up, bam, done. You’re dropped into a very comfortable three-pane library screen reminiscent of iTunes when it was good.</p>
<p>From there I was also very happy to just hit Ctrl+F, be placed in the universal search bar, look up albums, artists or tracks, and have a few obvious options on what to do next. The app feels snappy even when rapidly scrolling through hundreds of albums. It <em>even</em> properly shows multi-disc albums. Another thing that I appreciated is that albums are grouped in the queue, so if you queue a couple of albums you can see (and also re-order!) them as whole units rather than a bunch of tracks.</p>
<p>I could nitpick the “now playing” section which seems a little bit unfinished, and some GNOME-isms like putting some settings into the Settings window (good) and some settings in three-dot menus (why?). But, all things considered, and given that it’s a pre-1.0 release, I’m really impressed by what the developers did in what seems to be a little over two years. Great job!</p>
<p><img src="https://crescentro.se/posts/linux-music-players-2026/recordbox.png" alt="screenshot of Recordbox" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></p>
<h2 id="-5">Strawberry (Clementine, Amarok)</h2>
<p><a href="https://amarok.kde.org/">Amarok</a> needs little introduction - it was <em>the</em> Linux music player of its day, back when getting the audio drivers to work was a cause for celebration in its own right. It heavily influenced <a href="https://www.clementine-player.org/">Clementine</a> and <a href="https://www.strawberrymusicplayer.org/">Strawberry</a>. I’m grouping them all together because Clementine and Strawberry both look like Amarok’s UI was dragged kicking and screaming from late 90s into the early 2010s, and out of those three, Strawberry seems to be the most prominent one, while Amarok is kinda buggy on my WM.</p>
<p>Both Clementine and Strawberry seem functional, but out of the two, Strawberry looks marginally better with the context pane and slightly more consistent design. The interface is still less intuitive than I’d like it to be, and there’s really no need to have a giant translucent strawberry in the middle of my screen at all times. The foundation seems solid, though, and I really think that this venerable lineage of music players could reclaim its crown as the undisputed king of music players with a clean new design that streamlined the experience, trimmed some of the cruft, and modernized the appearance to match the rest of the Plasma desktop.</p>
<p><img src="https://crescentro.se/posts/linux-music-players-2026/strawberry.png" alt="screenshot of Strawberry" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></p>
<h2 id="-6">Tauon</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Taiko2k/Tauon">Tauon</a> is “the music player of today”. (It seems like the tagline used to be “Linux desktop music player from the future”, which sounds way cooler, but okay…)</p>
<p>I’m going to be super honest here - I never liked the “everything-is-a-playlist” approach of a specific breed of music players. Some people swear by it, but I find it overwhelming and confusing.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, if this is your vibe, Tauon seems solid. The UI is a bit reminiscent of a DJ deck - I think it’s the default color scheme and the stretched icons. Being a native app, it’s super snappy, and scrolling through 8k+ tracks feels smooth, even if the scroll bar is on the left of the window for some reason. Navigation is not super intuitive at the start, but it certainly gets out of your way as much as possible and I see how I could learn to appreciate it with a little bit of effort.</p>
<p>Tauon also seems to support Plex, Subsonic, Jellyfin and even Spotify as network sources, includes tag management options, a lyrics editor and Discord integration if that’s your jam. It certainly gives Feishin a run for its money in the features department. Overall, if you’d consider yourself a “power user” and you’ve been looking for a Linux version of foobar2000, this is the app for you.</p>
<p><img src="https://crescentro.se/posts/linux-music-players-2026/tauon.png" alt="screenshot of Tauon" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></p>
<h2 id="-7">Summary</h2>
<p>If you have a Jellyfin or a Subsonic-compatible server, and even if you do not but are willing to spend a little bit of time setting one up, <a href="https://github.com/jeffvli/feishin">Feishin</a> is the obvious choice. It works great, looks modern, and has tons of features. Once you set it up, it’s super simple to use.</p>
<p>For local playback or for the Electron-averse, <a href="https://github.com/Taiko2k/Tauon">Tauon</a> is definitely the power user’s choice with all of its intricacies. Otherwise, <a href="https://codeberg.org/edestcroix/Recordbox">Recordbox</a> is shaping up to be a really good choice, and <a href="https://github.com/htkhiem/euphonica">Euphonica</a> is still my pick if you already have an MPD server running.</p>
<p>If you’re just looking to play a few tracks now and then, I don’t know why you’ve been reading up until now, but <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/amberol">Amberol</a> is super cute.</p>
<p>Honestly, I’m really happy with this. I started looking into this feeling a bit desperate, but there’s actually a vibrant ecosystem of native Linux apps out there, with people building things they care about, and even if all the features aren’t all the way there yet, it’s much better than it was. I hope these trends continue!</p>

And yet, in the same period, the CCF was overturning roughly half of all Russian requests that it received complaints about. This raises questions about whether the measures had been stringent enough.</p><p>One report describes how in 2024 Russia attempted to place red diffusions on judges and a prosecutor at the International Criminal Court, after the body issued arrest warrants for President Vladimir Putin and another government official for their actions in Ukraine. These requests from Moscow were rejected.</p><p>Even while concerns about Russia's misuse of Interpol's systems were being expressed inside the organisation, the reports also show that discussions were taking place in 2024 and 2025 about whether to remove additional restrictions on Russian activity.</p><p>This seems to have been settled in Moscow's favour. The whistleblower told the BBC that in 2025 Interpol quietly dropped some extra measures against Russia — it is not clear how far this softening may have gone. Despite repeated requests, Interpol said it was not able to comment due to its "strict rules on the processing of data".</p><p>The BBC was unable to disclose all the details of the leak to Interpol as doing so could reveal the source. However, when asked about the issues raised in the investigation, Interpol said it was "concerned that a number of the accusations seems to come from a misunderstanding of how Interpol and CCF systems work, or factual errors about data and changes within Interpol's systems".</p><p>"It is untrue to say that we prioritise police co-operation over preventing abuse – Interpol follows its constitution that expressly forbids the use of our systems on information that is of a predominantly political, military, religious or racial character."</p><p>And in the past, it has said it can do more good to prevent crimes by ensuring that lines of communication remain open.</p><p>We asked Russia's ministry of internal affairs for comment, but it did not respond.</p><p>Lawyers Yuriy Nemets and Ben Keith agree that Interpol should do more to prevent misuse of its systems. "If countries are found to be significantly and persistently abusing red notices and diffusions, then they should be suspended from the system for a period of time," says Keith.</p><p>Otherwise, Igor Pestrikov fears that Russia, "with the push of a button, can enter anything, pin any crime on you - this lets them persecute you further around the world".</p><p><i id="additional-reporting:-andreea-jitaru-and-ned-davies"><b id="additional-reporting:-andreea-jitaru-and-ned-davies">Additional reporting: Andreea Jitaru and Ned Davies</b></i></p></div></article></div>]]></description>

                        <p>French politicians have passed a bill that will ban social media use by under-15s, a move championed by President Emmanuel Macron as a way to protect children from excessive screen time.</p>
<p>The lower National Assembly adopted the text by a vote of 130 to 21 in a lengthy session that started yesterday.</p>
<p>It will now go to the Senate, France's upper house, ahead of becoming law.</p>
<p>Mr Macron hailed the vote as a "major step" to protect French children and teenagers in a post on X.</p>
<p>The legislation, which also provides for a ban on mobile phones in high schools, would make France the second country to take such a step following Australia's ban for under-16s in December<a href="https://www.rte.ie/news/world/2025/1209/1547984-australia-social-media-ban/" target="_blank">.</a></p>
<p>As social media has grown, so has concern that too much screen time is harming child development and contributing to mental health problems.</p>
<p>"The emotions of our children and teenagers are not for sale or to be manipulated, either by American platforms or Chinese algorithms," Mr Macron said in a video broadcast on Saturday.</p>

<figcaption>The draft bill excludes online encyclopedias and educational platforms</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Authorities want the measures to be enforced from the start of the 2026 school year for new accounts.</p>
<p>Former prime minister Gabriel Attal, who leads Mr Macron's Renaissance party in the lower house, said he hoped the Senate would pass the bill by mid-February so that the ban could come into force on 1 September.</p>
<p>He added that "social media platforms will then have until 31 December to deactivate existing accounts" that do not comply with the age limit.</p>
<p>In addition to combatting the impact of screens and social media on the mental health of young adolescents, Mr Attal stressed the measure would counter "a number of powers that, through social media platforms, want to colonise minds".</p>
<p>"France can be a pioneer in Europe in a month: we can change the lives of our young people and our families, and perhaps also change the destiny of our country in terms of independence," he said.</p>
<p>France's public health watchdog ANSES said this month that social media such as TikTok, Snapchat and Instagram had several detrimental effects on adolescents, particularly girls, though it was not the sole reason for their declining mental health.</p>
<p>The risks listed include cyberbullying and exposure to violent content.</p>
<p>The legislation stipulates that "access to an online social networking service provided by an online platform is prohibited for minors under the age of 15".</p>
<p>The draft bill excludes online encyclopedias and educational platforms.</p>
<p>An effective age verification system would have to come into force for the ban to become reality.</p>
<p>Work on such a system is under way at the European level.</p>

<figcaption>President Emmanuel Macron has backed a ban on pupils having mobile phones in high schools</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Arnaud Saint-Martin, of the left-wing France Unbowed party, criticised the ban as "a form of digital paternalism" and an "overly simplistic" response to the negative impacts of technology.</p>
<p>Yesterday, nine child protection associations urged politicians to "hold platforms accountable", not "ban" children from social media.</p>
<p>Mr Macron has also backed a ban on pupils having mobile phones in high schools.</p>
<p>In 2018, France banned children from using mobile phones in colleges, the schools attended between the ages of 11 and 15.</p>
<p>Former prime minister Elisabeth Borne expressed reservations about the measure.</p>
<p>"It's more complicated than that," she told broadcaster France 2.</p>
<p>"We first need to make sure that the ban is properly enforced in middle schools," she added.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.rte.ie/news/world/2025/1209/1547984-australia-social-media-ban/" target="_blank">In December, Australia became the first country to implement a minimum age for social media use</a>, with platforms like Instagram, TikTok and YouTube forced to block more than a million accounts.</p>
<p>It required ten of the biggest platforms to block Australians aged under 16 or be fined up to A$49.5 million (€28 million).</p>
<p>The law received criticism from major technology companies and free speech advocates, but was praised by parents and child advocates.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-v-40f5842c="" id="app"><p>Today, we are introducing Kimi K2.5, the most powerful open-source model to date.</p><p>Kimi K2.5 builds on Kimi K2 with continued pretraining over approximately 15T mixed visual and text tokens. Built as a native multimodal model, K2.5 delivers state-of-the-art <strong>coding and vision</strong> capabilities and a self-directed <strong>agent swarm</strong> paradigm.</p><p>For complex tasks, Kimi K2.5 can self-direct an <strong>agent swarm</strong> with up to 100 sub-agents, executing parallel workflows across up to <strong>1,500</strong> <strong>tool calls</strong>. Compared with a single-agent setup, this reduces execution time by up to <strong>4.5x</strong>. The agent swarm is automatically created and orchestrated by Kimi K2.5 without any predefined subagents or workflow.</p><p>Kimi K2.5 is available via <strong><a href="https://www.kimi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Kimi.com</a>, the Kimi App, the <a href="https://platform.moonshot.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">API</a>, and <a href="http://www.kimi.com/code" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Kimi Code</a></strong>. Kimi.com &amp; Kimi App now supports 4 modes: K2.5 Instant, K2.5 Thinking, K2.5 Agent, and K2.5 Agent Swarm (Beta).

Coding with Vision <a href="#_1-coding-with-vision" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;1. Coding with Vision&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Kimi K2.5 is the strongest open-source model to date for coding, with particularly strong capabilities in front-end development.</p><p>K2.5 can turn simple conversations into complete front-end interfaces, implementing <strong>interactive layouts</strong> and <strong>rich animations such as scroll-triggered effects</strong>. Below are examples generated by K2.5 from a single prompt with image-gen tool:</p><!----><p>Beyond text prompts, K2.5 excels at <strong>coding with vision</strong>. By reasoning over images and video, K2.5 improves image/video-to-code generation and visual debugging, lowering the barrier for users to express intent visually.</p><p>Here is an example of K2.5 reconstructing a website from video:</p><!----><p>This capability stems from massive-scale vision-text joint pre-training. At scale, the trade-off between vision and text capabilities disappears — they improve in unison.</p><p>Below is an example of K2.5 reasoning over a puzzle and marking the shortest path using code:</p><!----><p><strong>K2.5 excels in real-world software engineering tasks.</strong> We evaluate it using <strong>Kimi Code Bench</strong>, our <strong>internal coding benchmark</strong> covering diverse end-to-end tasks — from building to debugging, refactoring, testing, and scripting — across multiple programming languages. On this benchmark, <strong>K2.5 shows consistent and meaningful improvements over</strong> <strong>K2</strong> <strong>across task types</strong>.</p><p><img src="https://statics.moonshot.cn/blogs/k2-5/img_v3_02ub_47858019-34ce-4e34-ae76-f7165f95b91g.png"></p><p>To try out K2.5's agentic coding capabilities, <strong><a href="http://kimi.com/agent" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">K2.5 Agent</a></strong> offers a set of preconfigured tools for immediate, hands-on experiences. For software engineering use cases, we recommend pairing Kimi K2.5 with our new coding product, <strong><a href="https://www.kimi.com/code" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Kimi Code</a></strong>.</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.kimi.com/code" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Kimi Code</a></strong> works in your terminal and can be integrated with various IDEs including VSCode, Cursor, Zed, etc. Kimi Code is open-sourced and supports images and videos as inputs.

Running these subtasks concurrently significantly reduces end-to-end latency compared to sequential agent execution.</p><p>Training a reliable parallel orchestrator is challenging due to delayed, sparse, and non-stationary feedback from independently running subagents. A common failure mode is <strong>serial collapse</strong>, where the orchestrator defaults to single-agent execution despite having parallel capacity.

The ‌iPhone‌ 5s came out in September 2013, while the ‌iPhone‌ 6 launched in September 2014.</p>
<p>According to Apple's release notes for the update, iOS 12.5.8 extends the certificate required for features like iMessage, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a>, and device activation, so they will continue to work after January 2027.</p>
<p>Originally, certificate-limited functions like device activation would have ceased when the certificate expired, but now key features on the two older iPhones will continue to work in the years to come.</p>
<p>Prior to now, the ‌iPhone‌ 5s and ‌iPhone‌ 6 last received software updates in January 2023, when Apple released important security fixes.</p>
<p>Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/06/apple-iphone-security-updates-five-year-minimum/">has publicly committed</a> to providing a minimum of five years of security updates for an ‌iPhone‌ from the time that it launches, but it often offers vulnerability fixes for an even longer period of time.</p>
<p>The ‌iPhone‌ 6s, for example, was released 11 years ago, but it received a security update in September 2025 with the launch of iOS 15.8.5. The device received an iOS 15.8.6 update just today, adding the same certificate extension.</p>
<p>Apple also released new versions of iOS 18 and iOS 16.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Change implies Canadian startups have to incorporate in the US, Cayman Islands, or Singapore to join accelerator. </p><article>
                                    
<p>Y Combinator has revised its standard deal terms to exclude Canada as a permitted site of investment, implying that Canadian startups aspiring to join the prestigious San Francisco-based startup accelerator will have to incorporate their companies elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As first reported by <a href="https://thelogic.co/news/exclusive/y-combinator-canada-startups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" title=""><em>The Logic</em></a> Monday, Y Combinator’s standard deal terms webpage now says it invests in corporations based in the United States, the Cayman Islands, or Singapore. Canada was in that list as recently as Nov. 2, 2025, according to an archived version of the webpage, but the reference was removed by the end of that month. Dozens of <a href="https://betakit.com/opennote-raises-850000-usd-secures-y-combinator-spot-for-edtech-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">Canadian</a> <a href="https://betakit.com/team-of-toronto-talent-unites-after-y-combinator-to-build-clado/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">companies</a> have been part of Y Combinator’s <a href="https://betakit.com/meet-the-y-combinator-winter-2024-cohort-startups-with-canadian-roots/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">numerous</a> winter and summer cohorts since the first one was accepted in 2008.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The deal terms go on to state that if a startup is already incorporated in another country that is “not one of the three” (previously “four”) countries listed, the startup needs to “flip” its corporate structure to have a parent company in one of those three countries.</p>



<p>BetaKit has reached out to Y Combinator for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The gravitational pull of Y Combinator’s program over Canadian startups has <a href="https://betakit.com/y-combinator-is-stealing-canadian-startups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">increased in recent years</a>, aided by remote policies instituted during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the 2010s, there were usually fewer than five Canadian-headquartered companies in a given Y Combinator cohort, according to data gathered last year by <a href="https://x.com/bram/status/1896999177256886726?s=20">Bram Sugarman</a>. Between winter 2020 and winter 2022, that number grew to range between nine and 15 startups in the program.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>RELATED: </strong><a href="https://betakit.com/y-combinator-is-stealing-canadian-startups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title=""><strong>Y Combinator is stealing Canadian startups</strong></a></p>



<p>It is common practice for Canadian founders to set up shop in the Valley, especially to participate in Y Combinator. Y Combinator CEO Garry Tan claimed in an X post last year that “The Canadians stay in the USA and raise more money. The ones that stay in SF after demo day become unicorns at 2.5X the rate.”</p>



<p>Tan <a href="https://x.com/garrytan/status/1897161477548896370?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" title="">added</a> at the time that he was part of a YC dinner with many Canadian founders looking to base their startups in San Francisco after graduation.</p>



<p>One such company is Guelph, Ont.- and Irvine, Calif.-based edtech startup <a href="https://betakit.com/opennote-raises-850000-usd-secures-y-combinator-spot-for-edtech-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">Opennote</a>. A member of Y Combinator’s Summer 2025 batch, co-founder Vedant Vyas told BetaKit last July that the firm hoped to scale out of the Bay Area, citing support from US-based investors and an increased institutional willingness in the US to pilot new edtech solutions.</p>



<p>The pull was a topic of conversation at Toronto Tech Week’s <a href="https://betakit.com/canadian-tech-leaders-tell-the-next-generation-to-learn-to-say-no-at-homecoming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">Homecoming event</a> in June 2025, where Shopify president Harley Finkelstein, Wealthsimple founder Mike Katchen, and Cohere founder Aidan Gomez encouraged the crowd to say no to leaving Canada.</p>



<p>“It’s the Valley-or-bust mentality that breaks the ecosystem and really hurts Canada,” Gomez said.&nbsp;</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Hi! Long time no see, huh? 🙂</p>



<p>It’s been three years since my last State of the Windows article, which was about the inconsistencies in the Windows 11 user experience. Since then, Microsoft (and the world as a whole to be quite honest) has gotten through a lot of changes, especially since the introduction of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, and in our case, most importantly, Microsoft Copilot.</p>



<p>Until a few years ago, Windows was Microsoft’s crown jewel (or as they said in the Windows 7 commercial, <strong>the heartbeat of Microsoft</strong>), an impressive operating system that had the purpose to be a common platform for all devices. However, since the launch of Windows 11, which at first had the purpose to somewhat modernize the look and feel of the OS, it seems that priorities have changed quite a bit.</p>



<p>Today we are going to talk about the perceived drop of quality in Windows, from fundamental issues like critical bugs and incidents from the last 3 years to how everything’s become a Copilot upsell funnel mechanism.</p>



<p>So, without further ado, let’s go!</p>



<p>First, let’s talk about the current, show-stopping errors that appeared with the latest January 2026 update, and how to fix them.</p>



<h2>1. PCs that wouldn’t shutdown – January 2026.</h2>



<p>This is one of the bugs that I’ve actually encountered a few days ago at work – people would come in saying that their PCs would either act unresponsive after shutting down (as in, they wouldn’t start up again the next day), or it would reboot immediately after shutting down.  </p>



<p>This issue was introduced with the January 2026 update, KB5073455&nbsp;and it is more prominent on newer platforms, especially Intel’s Meteor Lake and Arrow Lake.</p>



<p>Reportedly this issue is caused by the System Guard Secure Launch, a virtualization-based security component which, as the name implies, protects the boot process by using DRTM, or Dynamic Root of Trust for Measurement.</p>

<p>Since last Patch Tuesday, Microsoft released a patch for this issue, <a href="https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=KB5077797">KB5077797</a>, which seems to solve the issues. </p>



<p>As a temporary workaround, users can shutdown their PCs using the Command Prompt, by entering <em><strong>shutdown /s /t 0</strong>.</em> But this begs the question, why does the shutdown command work through this command which supposedly does the same thing, but not through the classic shutdown button?</p>



<h2>2. Outlook “classic” can’t open pst files – january 2026</h2>



<p>Once again, this month’s Patch Tuesday brought another major issue, which has the potential to affect one’s productivity in a big way. </p>



<p>If the KB5074109&nbsp;is installed, applications can become unresponsive when accessing PST files stored on cloud storage. To put it simply, if you have your mail archive saved on OneDrive or Dropbox and are still using the classic Win32 Outlook (and not the WebView based one) it’s possible that you can’t access the file, since the application would become unresponsive.</p>



<p>Also, users with Outlook POP account profiles and profiles with PST files report that Outlook hangs and does not exit properly.</p>



<p>Up until yesterday, the only fixes were to either <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/classic-outlook-profiles-with-pop-accounts-and-psts-hang-after-windows-updates-on-january-13-2026-590fe356-ecc2-49f4-b9e3-bd39fafa58f6#wl">uninstall the update or to “use webmail”</a>.  Their words, not mine.</p>

<p>However, as of January 25th, Microsoft released the <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/help/5078132" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">KB5078132</a> update, which should fix the issue.</p>



<p>Some other issues with the latest update include:</p>



<p>Apps that wouldn’t load (including system ones like Notepad), crashing with the error 0x803f8001.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, these are only some of the more prominent issues that occurred in the last year.</p>



<h2>But wait, that’s not all! </h2>



<p>Another ever-growing issue is the fact that Windows is <strong><em>bloated</em></strong>. And I’m not talking about the number of apps that are included in the OS or something that any script or custom OS could fix, but the fact that critical components are becoming so heavy that Microsoft has to develop workarounds in order to make them feel faster.</p>



<p>The prime example is Windows Explorer, which has become so sluggish that it has to be preloaded in order to make it faster, but even then it’s actually slower than previous versions of Windows! </p>

<p>More than 4 times bigger! <em>And you probably know why</em>. More on that later.</p>



<p>Last, but not least, the technical debt of Windows has become almost unbearable. 30+ years of Windows NT certainly adds up. And the fact that Microsoft can’t focus on a visual language or a software platform for once is daunting, especially since given the nature of Windows you have to support them <em>all</em>.</p>



<p>However, the biggest problem is that Windows is not only buggy. Sure, a piece of software of this magnitude can and will have its fair share of issues. Our use cases have gotten more complex and the software that we expect to fulfill those use cases have become more complex, more secure, more powerful, you name it. That being said…</p>



<h2>windows is getting annoying.</h2>



<p>Let’s tackle the elephant in the room.</p>



<p>LLMs (and AI as a whole) have the potential to be an outright revolution, changing the fabric of society and the way of our lives. Microsoft Copilot as well could be a brilliant idea if it is implemented correctly and has the power to completely transform Microsoft into an even bigger juggernaut, unlocking even more of that sweet shareholder value… if it’s done properly, that is.</p>



<p>Introduced in 2023, Microsoft Copilot is Microsoft’s chatbot based on OpenAI’s models after a $10 billion investment. Introduced in Windows 11 with the December 2023 Patch Tuesday, at first it was just a benign WebView application that could be easily removed. However, since 2024, Copilot and artificial intelligence have taken a critical role in Microsoft’s overall strategy, especially in areas like programming.</p>



<p>This shift also showed up in subsequent versions of Windows.</p>



<p>In Windows 11 24H2, the main highlight of the new update was the introduction of a suite of AI features, with the most important being Windows Recall.</p>



<p>The flagship feature of 24H2, Recall was intended to a be a “photographic memory” of sorts for your PC. This meant that, as you might have guessed, Windows Recall would take a snapshot of your screen every few seconds. Then, the information from those screenshots would be processed using local AI to make it searchable.</p>

<p>However, soon after it was introduced it became clear that it was a security nightmare. Early security researchers discovered that the data was stored in a largely unencrypted SQLite database, making it a goldmine for info-stealing malware. Not only that, but the early builds of Recall had no option to disable it. The backlash was so severe that Microsoft was forced to pull the feature just days before the Copilot+ PC launch in 2024, leaving a new generation of PCs without their flagship feature. </p>



<p>Applications like Signal and Brave implemented anti-Recall features that would prevent the app from taking screenshots.</p>



<p>While Microsoft would mitigate the main security concerns related to Recall, by making it uninstallable, encrypting its database and making it usable only if Windows Hello was enabled, the damage was already done. </p>



<p>Also, Windows Recall is one of the main reasons why Windows updates are so big these days, as each Windows update also introduces updates to the AI models included with the OS, even though you may not even have a Copilot+ PC that supports these features.</p>



<p>Apart from Recall, Windows has also suffered from an acute Copilot-ification. </p>

<p>The preinstalled browser (Edge) has Copilot.</p>



<p>The main text editor (Notepad) has Copilot.</p>



<p>There is also a dedicated Copilot app which is preinstalled and non-removable (in most cases)</p>



<p>The main photo viewer has a Copilot button which just opens the main app</p>



<p>The Settings application has Copilot in its search function (which doesn’t even work properly).</p>



<p>The Search application has Copilot (which only opens up the Copilot app) and needs a COMPLETE overhaul in my opinion.</p>



<p>Paint has Copilot</p>



<p>Office has Copilot (which is one of the few instances where Copilot and AI as a whole is genuinely useful if used correctly)</p>



<p>Also, judging by the latest Windows 11 builds, even Windows Explorer, which is already quite heavy in itself as we discussed earlier is getting Copilot!</p>

<p>With the Copilot epidemic also came the complete death of the “offline” Windows.</p>



<p>Perhaps the most nagging change since 2023 is the slow death of the local account. Microsoft has spent the last three years systematically closing every “backdoor” that allowed users to set up Windows without a Microsoft Account.</p>

<p>Methods like OOBE.exe /bypassNRO or a@a.com as the email for the account have been “fixed”, meaning that it becomes harder and harder to use a local account with each subsequent update.</p>



<h2>a vision with a crumbling foundation</h2>



<p>Looking back at the last three years, the “State of Windows” is one of extreme ambition built on a crumbling foundation. Microsoft is trying to build a futuristic AI skyscraper, but they are building it on top of a basement filled with 30-year-old technical debt and a ground floor that can’t even handle a shutdown command properly.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, the issue that plagued Windows since the dawn of time has only aggravated recently. Windows 11 is a mixture of old and new technologies that are glued together, with decades of legacy code that simply refuses to die (because if it did a lot of corporate costumers would complain, and whether we like it or not they are paying big cash for support to Microsoft). </p>



<p>Also, it tries to have a “modern” UI that unfortunately not only is inconsistent, but also it’s too heavy for its own good, being just a lipstick on a bloated old pig.</p>



<p>Last, but certainly not least, it is full of AI features that most people didn’t ask for, some are even actively feared (see Recall) and are also quite lacking in polish and usefulness. </p>



<p>I feel like a good analogy of the current situation with Windows is this picture which was shown in an internal presentation regarding the performance and reliability of pre-reset Longhorn </p>

<p>Until Microsoft stops treating Windows as an “AI innovation platform” of sorts and starts treating it as the stable, reliable tool it was always meant to be, the user experience will continue to feel like a battle between the person sitting at the desk and the company that built the desk.</p>

<p>26th January 2026</p>



<p>One of my favourite features of ChatGPT is its ability to write and execute code in a container. This feature launched as ChatGPT Code Interpreter <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Apr/12/code-interpreter/">nearly three years ago</a>, was half-heartedly rebranded to “Advanced Data Analysis” at some point and is generally really difficult to find detailed documentation about. Case in point: it appears to have had a <em>massive</em> upgrade at some point in the past few months, and I can’t find documentation about the new capabilities anywhere!</p>
<p>Here are the most notable new features:</p>
<ol>
<li>ChatGPT can <strong>directly run Bash commands</strong> now. Previously it was limited to Python code only, although it could run shell commands via the Python <code>subprocess</code> module.</li>
<li>
<strong>It has Node.js</strong> and can run JavaScript directly in addition to Python. I also got it to run “hello world” in <strong>Ruby, Perl, PHP, Go, Java, Swift, Kotlin, C and C++</strong>. No Rust yet though!</li>
<li>While the container still can’t make outbound network requests, <strong><code>pip install package</code> and <code>npm install package</code> both work</strong> now via a custom proxy mechanism.</li>
<li>ChatGPT can locate the URL for a file on the web and use a <code>container.download</code> tool to <strong>download that file and save it to a path</strong> within the sandboxed container.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is a substantial upgrade! ChatGPT can now write and then test code in 10 new languages (11 if you count Bash), can find files online and download them into the container, and can install additional packages via <code>pip</code> and <code>npm</code> to help it solve problems.</p>
<p>(OpenAI <em>really</em> need to develop better habits at <a href="https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6825453-chatgpt-release-notes">keeping their release notes up-to-date</a>!)</p>
<p>I was initially suspicious that maybe I’d stumbled into a new preview feature that wasn’t available to everyone, but I <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/6977aa7c-7bd8-8006-8129-8c9e25126fed">tried some experiments</a> in a free ChatGPT account and confirmed that the new features are available there as well.</p>

<p>My first clue to the new features came the other day when I got curious about Los Angeles air quality, in particular has the growing number of electric vehicles there hade a measurable impact?</p>
<p>I prompted a fresh GPT-5.2 Thinking session with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Show me Los Angeles air quality over time for last 20 years</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here’s the <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/6977a80d-e6e4-8006-b4fe-ed8478fe99d8">shared transcript</a>. Annoyingly that doesn’t make the thinking trace available, so here’s a screenshot:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/container-download.jpg" alt="Exploring methods to fetch AQI data and reports Downloading AQI data for Los Angeles  I found an xlsx file titled &quot;Air Quality Statistics by City, 2000-2023&quot;, which should include data for Los Angeles. While user requested data for Using provided URL to download file  The URL from the error message leads to an Excel file containing air quality trends. I can use the container.download tool to fetch it. Let’s proceed with this approach and see if it works out for downloading the file directly! Analyzed Parsing and analyzing the data for Los Angeles  Now that we've downloaded the data, I'll parse it using Python. First, I'll focus on identifying the row(s) corresponding to Los Angeles, which may be labeled under &quot;Los Angeles-Long Beach-Anaheim, CA.&quot; Afterward, I'll plot metrics like &quot;Median AQI&quot; and &quot;Days Good&quot; over time to visualize trends. Let’s begin!"></p>
<p>This bit instantly caught my eye:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[...] The URL from the error message leads to an Excel file containing air quality trends. I can use the container.download tool to fetch it. [...]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What’s <code>container.download</code>? I <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/6977aab0-b874-8006-9b54-d3d216ed884b">asked ChatGPT</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Without running any searches tell me about your container.download tool</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And got back:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sure. <code>container.download</code> is a built-in tool I can call that <strong>fetches a file from a URL and saves it into the sandboxed container filesystem</strong> for this chat session.</p>
<h4 id="what-it-does">What it does</h4>
<ul>
<li>Takes a <strong>publicly reachable URL</strong> and a <strong>destination filepath</strong> in the container.</li>
<li>Downloads the bytes from that URL and writes them to the given path.</li>
<li>After that, I can read/process the file locally in the container (e.g., unzip it, parse it with Python, open it as an image, convert it, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="signature-inputs-">Signature (inputs)</h4>
<p>It’s called like this (conceptually):</p>
<div><pre>{
  <span>"url"</span>: <span><span>"</span>https://example.com/somefile.zip<span>"</span></span>,
  <span>"filepath"</span>: <span><span>"</span>/mnt/data/somefile.zip<span>"</span></span>
}</pre></div>
</blockquote>
<p>Further experimentation confirmed that <code>container.download</code> behaves as described.</p>
<p>I had it download one file from a server with logs enabled and captured the IP address and user-agent. Here are the most interesting headers:</p>
<pre><code>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko); compatible; ChatGPT-User/1.0; +https://openai.com/bot
Accept: text/html, application/xhtml+xml, application/xml;q=0.9, image/avif, image/webp, image/apng, */*;q=0.8, application/signed-exchange;v=b3;q=0.9
Cf-Connecting-Ip: 52.230.164.178
</code></pre>
<p>That <code>52.230.164.178</code> IP address <a href="http://ip-api.com/json/52.230.164.178">resolves to</a> Microsoft Azure Cloud (centralus) in Des Moines, Iowa.</p>
<h4 id="is-container-download-a-data-exfiltration-vulnerability-">Is container.download a data exfiltration vulnerability?</h4>
<p>On the one hand, this is really useful! ChatGPT can navigate around websites looking for useful files, download those files to a container and then process them using Python or other languages.</p>
<p>Is this a data exfiltration vulnerability though? Could a prompt injection attack trick ChatGPT into leaking private data out to a <code>container.download</code> call to a URL with a query string that includes sensitive information?</p>
<p>I don’t think it can. I tried getting it to assemble a URL with a query string and access it using <code>container.download</code> and it couldn’t do it. It told me that it got back this error:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ERROR: download failed because url not viewed in conversation before. open the file or url using web.run first.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This looks to me like the same safety trick <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/10/claude-web-fetch-tool/">used by Claude’s Web Fetch tool</a>: only allow URL access if that URL was either directly entered by the user or if it came from search results that could not have been influenced by a prompt injection.</p>
<p>(I poked at this a bit more and managed to get a simple constructed query string to pass through <code>web.run</code>—a different tool entirely—but when I tried to compose a longer query string containing the previous prompt history a <code>web.run</code> filter blocked it.)</p>
<p>So I <em>think</em> this is all safe, though I’m curious if it could hold firm against a more aggressive round of attacks from a seasoned security researcher.</p>
<h4 id="bash-and-other-languages">Bash and other languages</h4>
<p>The key lesson from coding agents like Claude Code and Codex CLI is that Bash rules everything: if an agent can run Bash commands in an environment it can do almost anything that can be achieved by typing commands into a computer.</p>
<p>When Anthropic added their own code interpreter feature to Claude <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/9/claude-code-interpreter/">last September</a> they built that around Bash rather than just Python. It looks to me like OpenAI have now done the same thing for ChatGPT.</p>
<p>Here’s what ChatGPT looks like when it runs a Bash command—here my prompt was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>npm install a fun package and demonstrate using it</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/chatgpt-bash.jpg" alt="Screenshot of ChatGPT 5.2 Thinking interface with Activity panel. Main chat shows user prompt &quot;npm install a fun package and demonstrate using it&quot; and response &quot;Thought for 32s > Yep — here's a fun one: cowsay 🐄 I installed it with npm and ran a tiny Node script:&quot; followed by bash code block containing &quot;mkdir -p /mnt/data/npmfun cd /mnt/data/npmfun npm init -y npm install cowsay --no-fund --no-audit node -e &quot;const cowsay=require('cowsay'); console.log(cowsay.say({text:'Hel&quot; and Output: section showing ASCII cow art saying &quot;< Hello from npm inside the container! >&quot; with cow drawing made of characters. Activity panel on right (32s) shows: &quot;Running npm install in container&quot; with bash command and output &quot;v22.16.0 10.9.2&quot;, &quot;Inspecting npm command output and container status&quot; with directory listing showing &quot;drwxr-xr-x 2 root oai_shared 80 Jan 26 17:32 . drwxrwxr-x 2 oai oai_shared 60 Jan 26 17:32 .. -rw-r--r-- 1 root root&quot;, &quot;Re-running npm install&quot; note about node_modules missing, and &quot;Rerunning npm install with output&quot; showing &quot;added 41 packages in 2s&quot;."></p>
<p>It’s useful to click on the “Thinking” or “Thought for 32s” links as that opens the Activity sidebar with a detailed trace of what ChatGPT did to arrive at its answer. This helps guard against cheating—ChatGPT might claim to have run Bash in the main window but it can’t fake those black and white logs in the Activity panel.</p>
<p>I had it run <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/6977b890-f1c0-8006-b39a-9a02c7ca1993">Hello World in various languages</a> later in that same session.</p>

<h4 id="installing-packages-from-pip-and-npm">Installing packages from pip and npm</h4>
<p>In the previous example ChatGPT installed the <code>cowsay</code> package from npm and used it to draw an ASCII-art cow. But how could it do that if the container can’t make outbound network requests?</p>
<p>In <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/69773501-b6d8-8006-bbf2-fa644561aa26">another session</a> I challenged it to explore its environment. and figure out how that worked.</p>
<p>Here’s <a href="https://github.com/simonw/research/blob/main/chatgpt-container-environment/README.md">the resulting Markdown report</a> it created.</p>
<p>The key magic appears to be a <code>applied-caas-gateway1.internal.api.openai.org</code> proxy, available within the container and with various packaging tools configured to use it.</p>
<p>The following environment variables cause <code>pip</code> and <code>uv</code> to install packages from that proxy instead of directly from PyPI:</p>
<pre><code>PIP_INDEX_URL=https://reader:****@packages.applied-caas-gateway1.internal.api.openai.org/.../pypi-public/simple
PIP_TRUSTED_HOST=packages.applied-caas-gateway1.internal.api.openai.org
UV_INDEX_URL=https://reader:****@packages.applied-caas-gateway1.internal.api.openai.org/.../pypi-public/simple
UV_INSECURE_HOST=https://packages.applied-caas-gateway1.internal.api.openai.org
</code></pre>
<p>This one appears to get <code>npm</code> to work:</p>
<pre><code>NPM_CONFIG_REGISTRY=https://reader:****@packages.applied-caas-gateway1.internal.api.openai.org/.../npm-public
</code></pre>
<p>And it reported these suspicious looking variables as well:</p>
<pre><code>CAAS_ARTIFACTORY_BASE_URL=packages.applied-caas-gateway1.internal.api.openai.org
CAAS_ARTIFACTORY_PYPI_REGISTRY=.../artifactory/api/pypi/pypi-public
CAAS_ARTIFACTORY_NPM_REGISTRY=.../artifactory/api/npm/npm-public
CAAS_ARTIFACTORY_GO_REGISTRY=.../artifactory/api/go/golang-main
CAAS_ARTIFACTORY_MAVEN_REGISTRY=.../artifactory/maven-public
CAAS_ARTIFACTORY_GRADLE_REGISTRY=.../artifactory/gradle-public
CAAS_ARTIFACTORY_CARGO_REGISTRY=.../artifactory/api/cargo/cargo-public/index
CAAS_ARTIFACTORY_DOCKER_REGISTRY=.../dockerhub-public
CAAS_ARTIFACTORY_READER_USERNAME=reader
CAAS_ARTIFACTORY_READER_PASSWORD=****
NETWORK=caas_packages_only
</code></pre>
<p>Neither Rust nor Docker are installed in the container environment, but maybe those registry references are a clue of features still to come.</p>
<h4 id="adding-it-all-together">Adding it all together</h4>
<p>The result of all of this? You can tell ChatGPT to use Python or Node.js packages as part of a conversation and it will be able to install them and apply them against files you upload or that it downloads from the public web. That’s <em>really</em> cool.</p>
<p>The big missing feature here should be the easiest to provide: we need <strong>official documentation</strong>! A release notes entry would be a good start, but there are a lot of subtle details to how this new stuff works, its limitations and what it can be used for.</p>
<p>As always, I’d also encourage OpenAI to come up with a name for this set of features that properly represents how it works and what it can do.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I’m going to call this <strong>ChatGPT Containers</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="list-of-tools">Update: a full list of tools</h4>
<p>I decided to ask ChatGPT about other tools that were available to it in case there was anything interesting in there:</p>
<blockquote><p>List all tools that are available to you, with their exact names and descriptions and signatures</p></blockquote>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2026/01/26/cursor_opinion/">https://www.theregister.com/2026/01/26/cursor_opinion/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46769965">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p><span>Opinion</span> AI-integrated development environment (IDE) company Cursor recently <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cursor.com/blog/scaling-agents">implied</a> it had built a working web browser almost entirely with its AI agents. I won't say they lied, but CEO Michael Truell certainly <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/mntruell/status/2011562190286045552">tweeted</a>: "We built a browser with GPT-5.2 in Cursor."</p>
<p>He followed up with: "It's 3M+ lines of code across thousands of files. The rendering engine is from-scratch in Rust with HTML parsing, CSS cascade, layout, text shaping, paint, and a custom JS VM."</p>
<p>That sounds impressive, doesn't it? He also added: "It *kind of* works," which is not the most ringing endorsement. Still, numerous news sources and social media chatterboxes ran with the news that <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://medium.com/write-a-catalyst/ai-agents-built-a-web-browser-in-one-week-and-that-should-make-us-pause-1be4fab67d03">AI built a web browser in a week</a>.</p>

    

<p>Too bad it wasn't true. If you actually looked at Cursor engineer Wilson Lin's blog post about <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/wilsonzlin/fastrender">FastRender</a>, the AI-created web browser, you won't see much boasting about a working web browser. Instead, there's a video of a web browser sort of working, and a much less positive note that "building a browser from scratch is extremely difficult."</p>

        


        

<p>The thing about making such a software announcement on GitHub is that while the headlines are proclaiming another AI victory, developers have this nasty trick. They actually git the code and try it out.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://emsh.cat/cursor-implied-success-without-evidence/">Developers quickly discovered the "browser" barely compiles</a>, often does not run, and was heavily misrepresented in marketing.</p>

        

<p>As a techie, the actual blog post about how they tried and didn't really succeed was much more interesting. Of course, that Cursor sicced hundreds of GPT-5.2-style agents which ran for a week to produce three million lines of new code, to produce, at best, a semi-functional web browser from scratch, doesn't make for a good headline.</p>
<p>According to Perplexity, my AI chatbot of choice, this week‑long autonomous browser experiment consumed in the order of 10-20 trillion tokens and would have cost several million dollars at then‑current list prices for frontier models.</p>
<p>I'd just cloned a copy of Chromium myself, and for all that time and money, independent developers who cloned the repo reported that the codebase is very far from a functional browser. Recent commits do not compile cleanly, GitHub Actions runs on <code>main</code> are failing, and reviewers could not find a single recent commit that was built without errors.</p>

        

<p>Where builds succeeded after manual patching, performance was abysmal, with reports of pages taking around a minute to load and a heavy reliance on existing projects like <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://servo.org/">Servo</a>, a Rust-based web rendering engine, and QuickJS, a JavaScript engine, despite "from scratch" claims.</p>
<p>Lin defended the project on Y Combinator, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46650998">saying</a>, for instance: "The JS engine used a custom JS VM being developed in vendor/ecma-rs as part of the browser, which is a copy of my personal JS parser project vendored to make it easier to commit to." If it's derived from his personal JavaScript parser, that's not really from scratch, is it? Nor is it, from the sound of the argument, written by AI.</p>

<p>Gregory Terzian, a Servo maintainer, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46709191">responded</a>: "The actual code is worse; I can only describe it as a tangle of spaghetti... I can't make much, if anything, out of it." He then gave the backhanded compliment: "So I agree this isn't just wiring up of dependencies, and neither is it copied from existing implementations: it's a uniquely bad design that could never support anything resembling a real-world web engine." Now that's a burn.</p>
<p>From where I sit, what makes the Cursor case more dangerous than just a failed hack‑week project is that the hype is baked into its methodology. The "experiment" wasn't presented as what it really was: an interesting, but messy, internal learning exercise. No, it was rolled out as a milestone that conveniently confirmed the company's long‑running autonomous agent advertising. Missing from the story were basics any senior engineer would demand: passing Continuous Integration (CI), reproducible builds, and real benchmarks that show the browser doing more than limping through a hello-world page.</p>
<p>Zoom out, and CEOs are still predicting that AI will write 90 percent of code in a year, while most enterprise AI pilots still fail to deliver meaningful return on investment.</p>
<p>We're now in a kind of AI uncanny valley for developers. Sure, tools like Cursor can be genuinely helpful as glorified autocomplete and refactoring assistants, but marketing keeps insisting junior engineers can take whole projects from spec to shipping. When you start believing your own sizzle reel, you stop doing the tedious validation work that separates a demo from a deliverable.</p>
<p>Enough already. The hype has grown cold. Sarah Friar, OpenAI's CFO, recently blogged that in 2026, its focus would be on "<a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2026/01/20/openai_money/">practical adoption</a>." Let's see real-world practical results first, and then we can talk about practical AI adoption. ®</p>

INTRODUCTION</strong><br> This notice and its contents have been authorized by the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The Court has taken no position in this case regarding the merits of Plaintiffs’ claims or of Workday’s defenses.</span><span>The purpose of this notice is to provide notification of your following rights under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (“ADEA”):</span></p><div id="list01"><ul><li><p>You have the right to join this lawsuit if you applied for employment opportunities using Workday’s application platform since September 24, 2020, while you were 40 or more years old.</p></li><li><p>To join this lawsuit you must fill out and electronically sign and send in the Opt-In Consent To Join Form by clicking submit on or before March 7, 2026. How to do that is explained more fully in this Section III of this notice.</p></li><li><p>You have the right to have the Plaintiffs’ attorneys represent you in connection with this case, and to contact them for advice or assistance regarding the Opt-In Form or regarding the case, at this link or via the email addresses and phone numbers listed below in Section V of this Notice</p></li></ul></div><p id="ABOUT"><span><strong>II. WHAT IS THIS LAWSUIT ABOUT?</strong><br> Derek Mobley (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Workday, Inc. in the Northern District of California, Case No. 3:23-0770-RFL (“Lawsuit”), on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated. His allegations include that Workday, Inc., through its use of certain Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) features on its job application platform, violated the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (“ADEA”). Workday denies these allegations. The Court has not made any findings about whether Plaintiff’s claims or Workday’s denial of liability have any merit.</span><span>The Court has provisionally certified an ADEA collective, which includes: “All individuals aged 40 and over who, from September 24, 2020, through the present, applied for job opportunities using Workday, Inc.’s job application platform and were denied employment recommendations.” In this context, being “denied” an “employment recommendation” means that (i) the individual’s application was scored, sorted, ranked, or screened by Workday’s AI; (ii) the result of the AI scoring, sorting, ranking, or screening was not a recommendation to hire; and (iii) that result was communicated to the prospective employer, or the result was an automatic rejection by Workday.</span><span>Once you submit your Opt-In Consent to Join Form, the Court will subsequently need to determine that you meet the requirements described in the above paragraph in order for you to have the right to stay in the Lawsuit. However, all you need to know right now to opt-in to this case is that, on or after September 24, 2020, you applied for employment opportunities using Workday’s application platform while you were 40 or more years old.</span></p><p id="HOWTO"><span><strong>III. HOW TO JOIN THIS LAWSUIT</strong><br> To join this case, please complete, sign and return the Opt-In Consent To Join Form. If you have questions, you may contact the Plaintiffs’ attorneys by clicking submit or at the addresses and phone numbers provided below in Section V of this Notice.</span><span>If you are unable to sign and return the Opt-In Consent To Join Form electronically through this notice, you may obtain a paper copy of such forms to sign and return by mail, email, text or other delivery on or before March 7 2026. A paper copy can be downloaded and printed from this link or you can contact Plaintiffs’ attorneys to request such Forms by calling, emailing, texting or mailing them at the addresses or phone numbers provided below in Section V of this Notice. <strong>To join this case you must submit your Opt-In Consent To Join Form on or before March 7, 2026.</strong></span><span>The Opt-In Consent To Join Form requires that you sign page one and that you list your contact information and birthday on page two. Only page one will be publicly filed with the Court. Your contact information and birthday will not be filed with the Court as part of your initial opt-in to the case.</span></p><p id="HOWWILL"><span><strong>IV. HOW WILL YOUR CLAIM BE HANDLED AND PROVEN?</strong><br> After you submit your Opt-In Consent To Join Form to the Plaintiffs’ attorneys for filing, and unless and until you decide otherwise, they will continue to represent you as your counsel in this matter. As your legal representative, Plaintiffs’ attorneys can help you obtain the documents, testimony, and other evidence that you may need to show that you meet all the requirements necessary to litigate your claim as a party to this Lawsuit.<br> If you choose to join this case, you may be required, with the help of Plaintiffs’ attorneys, to answer written questions, produce documents related to your job application process, attend a deposition, and/or testify in court. Workday may also be required to answer written questions or produce documents related to its products to you. The Court has procedures that will protect your confidential information from public disclosure, including your birthday.</span></p><p id="LEGELEFFECTS"><span><strong>V. LEGAL EFFECT OF OPTING IN TO JOIN THIS CASE</strong><br> If you opt in to the Lawsuit, you will be bound by a favorable or unfavorable judgment on Plaintiffs’ ADEA claim. If you do not opt in, you will be precluded from future participation in the ADEA collective, including participation in any settlement related to the ADEA claim, but you may still bring your own separate lawsuit, depending on your situation. No ADEA collective has been finally certified, and you may still be dismissed from the case.</span></p><p id="NORETALI"><span><strong>VI. NO RETALIATION PERMITTED</strong><br> Federal law prohibits Workday from retaliating against you for opting in to this Lawsuit or otherwise exercising your rights.</span></p><p id="YOURLEGAL"><span><strong>VII. YOUR LEGAL REPRESENTATION IF YOU JOIN</strong><br> When you join this Lawsuit by electronically completing and sending the Opt-In Consent To Join Form, unless you decide otherwise, the lawyers representing you will be:</span></p><p id="text19"><span>You will not be responsible for paying any lawyers’ fees. Plaintiffs’ attorneys are being paid on contingency, which means that if Plaintiffs do not receive a recovery in this case, no lawyer fees will be owed. If Plaintiffs obtain a recovery, either by settlement or judgment, Plaintiffs’ attorneys may file a request with the Court to receive part of the recovery as compensation for their services.</span><span>If you want to join the Lawsuit, but prefer to retain your own attorney to represent you, you have the right to do so. You also have the right to represent yourself. <strong>To join this case you must submit the Opt-In Consent To Join Form with the Court on or before March 7, 2026.</strong></span></p><hr id="divider01"><p id="text13">PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT THE COURT WITH QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS LAWSUIT.</p><hr id="divider02"><p><span><img src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHg9IjAiIHk9IjAiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAzODQwIDEzMzkiIHdpZHRoPSIzODQwIiBoZWlnaHQ9IjEzMzkiIHByZXNlcnZlQXNwZWN0UmF0aW89Im5vbmUiPjxyZWN0IGZpbGw9IiMyNDI1MWYiIHdpZHRoPSIxMDAlIiBoZWlnaHQ9IjEwMCUiLz48L3N2Zz4%3D" data-src="assets/images/image02.jpg?v=f1a8d860" alt=""></span></p><hr id="divider03"></div><section id="done-section"><div id="container03"><p id="text06"><span>Almost there!<br> Check your inbox and click the confirmation link to complete your submission.<br> Don’t see the email?
