Instead of relying on a combination of dollars spent and miles traveled in the air, Delta will grant status based on a single metric—dollars spent—and raise the amount of spending required to get it. In short, SkyMiles is no longer a frequent-flier program; it’s a big-spender program. These changes are so drastic that one of the reporters at the preeminent travel-rewards website The Points Guy <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://thepointsguy.com/news/why-i-wont-chase-airline-status/">declared</a> that he’s going to “stop chasing airline status.”</p><p>When even the points insiders are sick of playing the mileage game, something has clearly gone wrong. In fact, frequent-flier programs are a symptom of a much deeper rot in the American air-travel industry. And although getting mad at airlines is perfectly reasonable, the blame ultimately lies with Congress.</p><p>From the late 1930s through the ’70s, the federal government regulated airlines as a public utility. The Civil Aeronautics Board decided which airlines could fly what routes and how much they could charge. It aimed to set prices that were fair for travelers and that would provide airlines with a modest profit. Then, in 1978, Congress passed a sweeping law deregulating the airline industry and ultimately abolishing the CAB. Unleashed from regulation, airlines devised new tactics to capture the market. American Airlines was one of the most aggressive. In the lead-up to the deregulation bills, it created discount “super saver” fares to sell off the final few remaining seats on planes. That meant cheap prices for last-minute travelers and more revenue for American, because the planes were going to take off whether or not the seat was filled. But these fares upset business travelers, who tended to buy tickets further in advance for higher prices. So in <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/timeline-events-american-airlines-history-011902886.html?guccounter=1">1981</a>, American developed AAdvantage, its frequent-flier program, to give them additional benefits. Other airlines followed suit.</p><p id="injected-recirculation-link-0" data-view-action="view link - injected link - item 1" data-event-element="injected link" data-event-position="1"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2022/06/summer-air-travel-flights-cancelled/661385/">Read: Air travel is a disaster right now. Here’s why.</a></p><p>In the early years, these programs were simple, like the punch card at a café where your 11th coffee is free. But three big changes transformed them into the systems we know today. First, in 1987, American partnered with Citibank to offer a branded credit card that offered points redeemable for flights on the airline. Second, in the ’90s, the airlines proliferated the number of fare classes, charging differential prices for tickets. With more complicated fare structures came the third change: Virgin America realized that the amount people spend on a flight, based on the fare class, is more important to their bottom line than the number of miles flown. So, in 2007, it introduced a loyalty <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/roadwarriorvoices/2016/02/25/frequent-flier-miles-points-loyalty-programs/80860962/">program</a> rewarding money spent rather than mileage accrued.</p><p>These three shifts fundamentally transformed the airline industry. They turned frequent-flier systems into the sprawling points systems they are today. And they turned airlines into something more like financial institutions that happen to fly planes on the side.</p><p>Here’s how the system works now: Airlines create points out of nothing and sell them for real money to banks with co-branded credit cards. The banks award points to cardholders for spending, and both the banks and credit-card companies make money off the swipe fees from the use of the card. Cardholders can redeem points for flights, as well as other goods and services sold through the airlines’ proprietary e-commerce portals.</p><p>For the airlines, this is a great deal. They incur no costs from points until they are redeemed—or ever, if the points are forgotten. This setup has made loyalty programs highly lucrative. <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90934980/how-much-do-we-charge-to-our-delta-air-american-express-cards-its-a-lot">Consumers now</a> charge nearly 1 percent of U.S. GDP to Delta’s American Express credit cards alone. A 2020 analysis by the <i>Financial Times</i> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ft.com/content/1bb94ed9-90de-4f15-aee0-3bf390b0f85e">found</a> that Wall Street lenders valued the major airlines’ mileage programs more highly than the airlines themselves. United’s MileagePlus program, for example, was valued at $22 billion, while the company’s market cap at the time was only $10.6 billion.</p><p>Is this a good deal for the American consumer? That’s a trickier question. Paying for a flight or a hotel room with points may feel like a free bonus, but because credit-card-swipe fees increase prices across the economy—Visa or Mastercard takes a cut of every sale—redeeming points is more like getting a little kickback. Certainly the system is bad for Americans who don’t have points-earning cards. They pay higher prices on ordinary goods and services but don’t get the points, effectively <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-credit-card-companies-reward-the-rich-and-punish-the-rest-of-us/">subsidizing</a> the perks of card users, who tend to be wealthier already.</p><p>Like the federal reserve, airlines issue currency—points—out of thin air. They also get to decide how much that currency is worth and what it can be spent on. This helps explain why the points system feels so opaque and, often, unfair. Online analysts try to offer estimates of points’ cash value, but airlines can <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://viewfromthewing.com/delta-air-lines-is-even-devaluing-your-banked-rollover-elite-qualifying-miles/">reduce</a> these <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://viewfromthewing.com/delta-ceo-were-not-done-making-changes-to-skymiles-status-or-first-class/">values</a> after the fact and change how points can be redeemed. Airlines even <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/credit-cards/is-buying-frequent-flyer-miles-ever-a-good-deal/">sell</a> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/travel/times-it-actually-makes-sense-to-buy-miles">points</a> at above their exchange-rate valuation, meaning that people are paying for something worth less than the money they’re buying it with, in part because it’s so hard to know what the real value is.</p><p>In this context, it’s easy to see why Delta is making changes. The shift to a focus on spending, rather than mileage, has long been coming, because of the rise of multiple fare classes and the decoupling of mileage and revenue. Limiting benefits and increasing the requirements for status, meanwhile, looks like a way to spread out costs: 1 percent of GDP spending is a lot of outstanding points that could be redeemed.</p><p>Still, you might wonder how airlines can get away with angering their customers by devaluing loyalty programs. Aren’t they worried that those customers will get a little less loyal? Well, not really. The U.S. has only four major carriers, which <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.npr.org/2023/03/07/1161640389/jetblue-spirit-airlines-doj-lawsuit">account</a> for more than three-quarters of the market, and they tend to move in lockstep. Indeed, American Airlines recently made a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://thepointsguy.com/news/american-aadvantage-vs-delta-skymiles/">similar</a> change to its mileage program. Customers don’t have many other places to go.</p><p>I<span>n this</span> and other respects, the strange evolution of airlines into quasi-banks reflects how badly deregulation has gone. Regulation carefully set the terms under which airlines could do business. It was designed to ensure that they remained a stable business and a reliable mode of transportation. Deregulation, in turn, allowed the airlines to pursue profits in whatever way they could—including getting into the financial sector.</p><p>The proponents of deregulation made a few big promises. The cost of flying would go down once airlines were free to compete on price. The industry would get less monopolistic as hundreds of new players entered the market, and it would be stable even without the government guaranteeing profitable rates. Small cities wouldn’t lose service. In the deregulators’ minds, airlines were like any other business. If they were allowed to compete freely, the magic of the market would make everything better. Whatever was good for the airlines’ bottom line would be good for consumers.</p><p>They were wrong. As I explain in my <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/why-flying-is-miserable-and-how-to-fix-it-ganesh-sitaraman/9798987053584?affiliate_id=atl-347">forthcoming book</a>, most of their predictions didn’t come true, because air travel isn’t a normal business. There are barriers to entry, such as the fixed supply of airport runways and gates. (And, for that matter, mileage programs, designed to keep customers from ditching an established airline for a rival.) There are network effects and economies of scale. There are high capital costs. (Airplanes aren’t cheap.) The idea that anyone could successfully start an airline and outcompete the big incumbents never made much sense.</p><p>After a relatively short period of fierce competition, the deregulated era quickly turned to consolidation and cost-cutting, as dozens of airlines either went bankrupt or were acquired. Service keeps getting worse, because the airlines, facing little competition, have nothing to fear from antagonizing passengers with cramped legroom, cancellations, and ever-multiplying fees for baggage and snacks. Worse still, without mandated service, cities and regions across the country have lost commercial air service, with <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://washingtonmonthly.com/2012/03/01/terminal-sickness/">serious consequences</a> for their economies. And when a crisis like 9/11 or the coronavirus pandemic comes along, the airlines—which prefer to direct their profits to stock buybacks rather than rainy-day funds—need massive financial relief from the federal government.</p><p id="injected-recirculation-link-1" data-view-action="view link - injected link - item 2" data-event-element="injected link" data-event-position="2"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/06/airline-customer-service-chatbot-ai/674412/">Read: Somehow, airline customer service is getting even worse</a></p><p>Deregulation even failed to deliver the one thing it is sometimes credited with: lowering prices. Airfare did get cheaper in the years after the 1978 deregulation law. But the cost of flying had already been falling before<i> </i>deregulation, and it kept falling after at about the same rate.</p><p>The old system of airline regulation wasn’t perfect. Barred from competing directly on price, the airlines got into an amenities arms race that notoriously included <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnimcgMPuXk">in-flight piano bars</a>. But the cure was worse than the disease. The industry went from being a regulated oligopoly, which had real problems, to an unregulated oligopoly, which we are now seeing is much worse.</p><p>Airlines serve a vital public need, just like railroads, the electric grid, and communication networks. They also exist within a system of special privileges from the government. The public has built and paid for a substantial federal infrastructure to coordinate flights safely. Historically, these are all standard reasons to regulate an industry. A modernized set of rules could arrest the trajectory of airlines becoming financialized e-commerce platforms—and maybe even get them to focus on making air travel less miserable.</p><div data-view-action="view - affiliate module" data-view-label="Why Flying Is Miserable - And How To Fix It"><a href="https://web.tertulia.com/book/9798987053584?affiliate=atl-347" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-label="Why Flying Is Miserable - And How To Fix It" data-action="click link - affiliate module - book cover" target="_blank"><picture><img alt="" loading="lazy" srcset="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/Zh_7jqRmMvGK6Gg6nXJl9R3pn9E=/0x0:333x500/80x120/media/img/book_reviews/2023/09/19/51XeRgTLhgL._SL500_/original.jpg, https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/KdBuSjWrqT4SQxIcOGX5eMfm2WE=/0x0:333x500/160x240/media/img/book_reviews/2023/09/19/51XeRgTLhgL._SL500_/original.jpg 2x" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/Zh_7jqRmMvGK6Gg6nXJl9R3pn9E=/0x0:333x500/80x120/media/img/book_reviews/2023/09/19/51XeRgTLhgL._SL500_/original.jpg" width="80" height="120"></picture></a></div><div><hr><p>​When you buy a book using a link on this page, we receive a commission.

Important risk factors that may cause such a difference include, but are not limited to: (i) the completion of the proposed transaction on anticipated terms and timing, including obtaining shareholder and regulatory approvals, anticipated tax treatment, unforeseen liabilities, future capital expenditures, revenues, expenses, earnings, synergies, economic performance, indebtedness, financial condition, losses, future prospects, business and management strategies for the management, expansion and growth of Splunk’s business and other conditions to the completion of the transaction; (ii) the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Splunk’s business and general economic conditions; (iii) Splunk’s ability to implement its business strategy; (iv) significant transaction costs associated with the proposed transaction; (v) potential litigation relating to the proposed transaction; (vi) the risk that disruptions from the proposed transaction will harm Splunk’s business, including current plans and operations; (vii) the ability of Splunk to retain and hire key personnel; (viii) potential adverse reactions or changes to business relationships resulting from the announcement or completion of the proposed transaction; (ix) legislative, regulatory and economic developments affecting Splunk’s business; (x) general economic and market developments and conditions; (xi) the evolving legal, regulatory and tax regimes under which Splunk operates; (xii) potential business uncertainty, including changes to existing business relationships, during the pendency of the merger that could affect Splunk’s financial performance; (xiii) restrictions during the pendency of the proposed transaction that may impact Splunk’s ability to pursue certain business opportunities or strategic transactions; and (xiv) unpredictability and severity of catastrophic events, including, but not limited to, acts of terrorism or outbreak of war or hostilities, as well as Splunk’s response to any of the aforementioned factors. These risks, as well as other risks associated with the proposed transaction, are more fully discussed in the Proxy Statement to be filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with the proposed transaction. While the list of factors presented here is, and the list of factors presented in the Proxy Statement will be, considered representative, no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. Unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles to the realization of forward looking statements. Consequences of material differences in results as compared with those anticipated in the forward-looking statements could include, among other things, business disruption, operational problems, financial loss, legal liability to third parties and similar risks, any of which could have a material adverse effect on Splunk’s financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. Splunk does not assume any obligation to publicly provide revisions or updates to any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, should circumstances change, except as otherwise required by securities and other applicable laws.</i></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>India is grappling with a three-and-a-half year surge in cyber crime, with analysis suggesting cities like Bengaluru and Gurgaon – centers of India's tech development – are also hubs of evil activity.</p>
<p>The report – <i>A Deep Dive into Cybercrime Trends Impacting India</i> from the non-profit Future Crime Research Foundation (FCRF) – identified cyber crime hot spots, as well as the most popular types of infosec assaults, from January 2020 until June 2023.</p>
<p>"The analysis of the top 10 cyber crime-prone districts in India reveals several common factors contributing to their vulnerability. These include geographical proximity to major urban centers, limited cyber security infrastructure, socioeconomic challenges, and low digital literacy," <a target="_blank" href="https://www.futurecrime.org/cyber-crime-research">states</a> the report.</p>

    

<p>Several of the most cyber crime-prone top geographies house tech hubs. Gurgaon and Bangalore – both <a target="_blank" href="https://hightech.cbrevancouver.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Asia-Pacific-Major-Report_Programming-Asia-Pacific-Tech-Cities-as-Global-Tech-Hubs_April-2019.pdf">considered</a> [PDF] among the top five most attractive cities for the IT industry in Asia – featured for the wrong reasons.</p>

        


        

<p>The Gurgaon district, which is home to a planned IT-focused city of the same name, made number six on FCRF's list. The district accounted for 8.1 percent of reported cyber crime, despite being home to less than 0.2 percent of India's population.</p>
<p>FCRF cited the high crime rate as "likely influenced by its status as a major corporate and IT hub, making it an attractive target for cyber criminals seeking valuable data or financial gains."</p>

        

<p>Outsourcing services and call centers are prominent in the area. Globally recognised tech names including Google, Microsoft, IBM India, Accenture, Cognizant, Infosys, Wipro and more all have presence in the city.</p>
<p>And while the city is known for economic affluence – it's <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gmda.gov.in/aboutus/metropolitan-area.html?language=en">said</a> to have the third highest per capita income in India – the Foundation suggested "disparities in digital literacy and cyber security awareness" could be factors likely to drive criminal activity.</p>

</ul>
<p>Meanwhile, Bangalore – in the district of Karnataka – was named by FCRF as an emerging cyber crime hotspot. The city is known as the "Silicon Valley of India" thanks to its proliferation of IT employers – including Infosys, Wipro, Tata Consultancy Services, IBM India, Microsoft, Google, Amazon Intel, Cisco, Samsung Research Institute, Nvidia Graphics and more.</p>
<p>Topping the list was Gurgaon's neighbor Bharatpur, with 18 percent of India's overall cyber crime. FCRF cites limited employment opportunities and lack of digital literacy as reasons for the region's prevalence of crime, as well as the fact it contains major urban centers like Delhi and Jaipur.</p>
<p>Mathura – a district filled with significant religious sites – took second place with 12 percent. The FCRF cited limited cyber security infrastructure and the area's status as a tourist attraction among likely reasons it was so popular with crims.</p>

        

<p>Another finding in the report was that of all reported cyber crimes in India, almost half (47.25 percent) involved Unified Payments Interface (UPI) fraud. Debit, credit card and sim swap fraud came in a distant second place with 11.27 percent. Overall, financially motivated crime accounted for 77.41 percent of incidents. ®</p>

        <p><em>This is article expands on the topic of gradual set-theoretic typing discussed during my keynote at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giYbq4HmfGA">ElixirConf US 2023</a>.</em></p>

<p>There is an on-going effort <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2023/06/22/type-system-updates-research-dev/">to research and develop a type system for Elixir</a>, lead by <a href="https://www.irif.fr/~gc/">Giuseppe Castagna</a>, CNRS Senior Researcher, and taken by <a href="https://www.irif.fr/users/gduboc/index">Guillaume Duboc</a> as part of his PhD studies.</p>

<p>In this article, we will discuss how the proposed type system will tackle gradual typing and how it relates to set-theoretic types, with the goal of providing an introduction to the ideas <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06391">presented in our paper</a>.</p>

<h2 id="set-theoretic-types">Set-theoretic types</h2>

<p>The type system we are currently researching and developing for Elixir is based on set-theoretic types, which is to say its operations are based on the fundamental set operations of union, intersection, and negation.</p>

<p>For example, the atom <code>:ok</code> is a value in Elixir, that can be represented by the type <code>:ok</code>. All atoms in Elixir as represented by themselves in the type system. A function that returns either <code>:ok</code> or <code>:error</code> is said to return <code>:ok or :error</code>, where the <code>or</code> operator represents the union.</p>

<p>The types <code>:ok</code> and <code>:error</code> are contained by the type <code>atom()</code>, which is an infinite set representing all atoms. The union of the types <code>:ok</code> and <code>atom()</code> can be written as <code>:ok or atom()</code>, and is equivalent to <code>atom()</code> (as <code>:ok</code> is a subset of <code>atom()</code>). The intersection of the types <code>:ok</code> and <code>atom()</code> can be written as <code>:ok and atom()</code>, and is equivalent to <code>:ok</code>.</p>

<p>Similarly, <code>integer()</code> is another infinite set representing all integers. <code>integer() or atom()</code> is the union of all integers and atoms. The intersection <code>integer() and atom()</code> is an empty set, which we call <code>none()</code>. The union of all types that exist in Elixir is called <code>term()</code>.</p>

<p>The beauty of set-theoretic types is that we can model many interesting properties found in Elixir programs on top of those fundamental set operations, which in turn we hope to make typing in Elixir both more expressive and accessible. Let’s see an example of how a type system feature, called bounded quantification (or bounded polymorphism), can be implemented with set-theoretic types.</p>

<h2 id="upper-and-lower-bounds">Upper and lower bounds</h2>

<p>The <code>identity</code> function is a function that receives an argument and returns it as is. In Java, it would be written as follows:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>static</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>T</span> <span>identity</span><span>(</span><span>T</span> <span>arg</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>arg</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>In TypeScript:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>identity</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>:</span> <span>T</span><span>):</span> <span>T</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>arg</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Or in Haskell:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>id</span> <span>::</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>a</span>
<span>id</span> <span>arg</span> <span>=</span> <span>arg</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>In all of the examples above, we say the function receives an argument of type variable <code>T</code> (or type variable <code>a</code> in Haskell’s case) and return a value of the same type <code>T</code>. We call this parametric polymorphism, because the function parameter - its argument - can take many (poly) shapes (morphs). In Elixir, we could then support:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>a</span>
<span>def</span> <span>identity</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>),</span> <span>do</span><span>:</span> <span>arg</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Sometimes we may want to further constrain those type variables. As example, let’s constraint the identity function in Java to numbers:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>static</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>T</span> <span>extends</span> <span>Number</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>T</span> <span>identity</span><span>(</span><span>T</span> <span>arg</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>arg</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Or in TypeScript:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>identity</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span> <span>extends</span> <span>number</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>:</span> <span>T</span><span>):</span> <span>T</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>arg</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>In Haskell, we can constrain to a typeclass, such as <code>Ord</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>id</span> <span>::</span> <span>Ord</span> <span>a</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>a</span>
<span>id</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>x</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>In order words, these functions can accept any type as long as they fullfil a given constraint. This in turn is called bounded polymorphism, because we are putting bounds on the types we can receive.</p>

<p>With all that said, how can we implement bounded polymorphism in set-theoretic types? Imagine we have a type variable <code>a</code>, how can we ensure it is bounded or constrained to another type?</p>

<p>With set-theoretic types, this operation is an intersection. If you have <code>a and atom()</code>, <code>a</code> can be the type <code>:foo</code>. <code>a</code> can also be the type <code>atom()</code>, which represents all atom types, but <code>a</code> cannot be <code>integer()</code>, as <code>integer() and atom()</code> will return an empty set. In other words, there is no need to introduce a new semantic construct, as intersections can be used to place upper bounds in type variables! Therefore, we could restrict Elixir’s identity function to numbers like this:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$</span> <span>a</span> <span>and</span> <span>number</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>a</span> <span>and</span> <span>number</span><span>()</span>
<span>def</span> <span>identity</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>),</span> <span>do</span><span>:</span> <span>arg</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Or course, we can provide syntax sugar for those constraints:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>a</span> <span>when</span> <span>a:</span> <span>number</span><span>()</span>
<span>def</span> <span>identity</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>),</span> <span>do</span><span>:</span> <span>arg</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>But at the end of the day it will simply expand to intersections. The important bit is that, at the semantic level, there is no need for additional constructs and representations.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: for the type-curious readers, set-theoretic types implement <a href="http://lucacardelli.name/Papers/OnUnderstanding.pdf">a limited form of bounded quantification <em>à la</em> Kernel Fun</a>. In a nutshell, it means we can only compare functions if they have the same bounds. For example, our type system states <code>a -&gt; a when a: integer() or boolean()</code> is not a subtype of <code>a -&gt; a when a: integer()</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We also get lower bounds for free. If intersections allow us to place an upper bound on a type variable, a union is equivalent to a lower bound as it specifies the type variable will always be augmented by the union-ed type. For example, <code>a or atom()</code> says the result will always include atoms plus whatever else specified by <code>a</code> (which may be an atom, <code>atom()</code> itself, or a completely disjoint type such as <code>integer()</code>).</p>

<p>Elixir protocols, which is an Elixir construct equivalent to Haskell Typeclasses or Java interfaces, is another example of functionality that can be modelled and composed with set-theoretic types without additional semantics. The exact mechanism to do so is left as an exercise to the reader (or the topic of a future blog post).</p>

<h2 id="enter-gradual-typing">Enter gradual typing</h2>

<p>Elixir is a functional dynamic programming language. Existing Elixir programs are untyped, which means that a type system needs mechanisms to interface existing Elixir code with future statically typed Elixir code. We can achieve this with gradual typing.</p>

<p>A gradual type system is a type system that defines a <code>dynamic()</code> type. It is sometimes written as <code>?</code> and sometimes known as the <code>any</code> type (but I prefer to avoid <code>any</code> because it is too short and too lax in languages like TypeScript).</p>

<p>In Elixir, the <code>dynamic()</code> type means the type is only known at runtime, effectively disabling static checks for that type. More interestingly, we can also place upper and lower bounds on the dynamic type using set operations. As we will soon learn, this will reveal interesting properties about our type system.</p>

<p>It is often said that gradual typing is the best of both words. Perhaps ironically, that’s true and false at the same time. If you use a gradual type system but you never use the <code>dynamic()</code> type, then it behaves exactly like a static type system. However, the more you use the <code>dynamic()</code> type, the fewer guarantees the type system will give you, the more the <code>dynamic()</code> type propagates through the system. Therefore, it is in our interest to reduce the occurrences of the <code>dynamic()</code> type as much as possible, and that’s what we set out to do.</p>

<h2 id="interfacing-static-and-dynamic-code-the-trouble-with-dynamic">Interfacing static and dynamic code: the trouble with <code>dynamic()</code></h2>

<p>Let’s go back to our constrained identity function that accepts only numbers:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>a</span> <span>when</span> <span>a:</span> <span>number</span><span>()</span>
<span>def</span> <span>identity</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>),</span> <span>do</span><span>:</span> <span>arg</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Now imagine that we have some untyped code that calls this function:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>debug</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>)</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>"we got: "</span> <span>&lt;&gt;</span> <span>identity</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Since <code>debug/1</code> is untyped, its argument will receive the type <code>dynamic()</code>.</p>

<p><code>debug/1</code> proceeds to call <code>identity</code> with an argument and then uses the string concatenation operator (<code>&lt;&gt;</code>) to concatenate <code>"we got: "</code> to the result of <code>identity(arg)</code>. Since <code>identity/1</code> is meant to return a number and string concatenation requires two strings as operands, there is a typing error in this program. On the other hand, if you call <code>debug("hello")</code> at runtime, the code will work and won’t raise any exceptions.</p>

<p>In other words, the static typing version of the program and its runtime execution do not match in behaviour. So how do we tackle this?</p>

<p>One option is to say that’s all behaving as expected. If <code>debug/1</code> is untyped, its <code>arg</code> has the <code>dynamic()</code> type. To type check this program, we specify that <code>identity(dynamic())</code> returns the <code>dynamic()</code> type, the concatenation of a string with <code>dynamic()</code> also returns <code>dynamic()</code>, and consequently <code>debug/1</code> gets the type <code>dynamic() -&gt; dynamic()</code>, with no type errors emitted.</p>

<p>The trouble is: this is not a very useful choice. Once <code>dynamic()</code> enters the system, it <em>spreads everywhere</em>, we perform fewer checks, effectively discarding the information that <code>identity/1</code> returns a number, and the overall type system becomes less useful.</p>

<p>Another option would be for us to say: once we call a statically typed function with <code>dynamic()</code>, we will ignore the <code>dynamic()</code> type. If the function says it returns a <code>number()</code>, then it will surely be a number! In this version, <code>identity(dynamic())</code> returns <code>number()</code> and the type system will catch a type error when concatenating a string with a number.</p>

<p>This is similar to the approach taken by TypeScript. This means we can perform further static checks, but it also means we can call <code>debug("foobar")</code> and that will return the string <code>"we got: foobar"</code>! But how can that be possible when the type system told us that <code>identity</code> returns a <code>number()</code>? This can lead to confusion and surprising results at runtime. We say this system is unsound, because the types at runtime do not match our compile-time types.</p>

<p>None of our solutions so far attempted to match the static and runtime behaviors, but rather, they picked one in favor of the other.</p>

<p>But don’t despair, there is yet another option. We could introduce runtime checks whenever we cross the “dynamic &lt;-&gt; static” boundaries. In this case, we could say <code>identity(dynamic())</code> returns a <code>number()</code>, but we will introduce a runtime check into the code to guarantee that’s the case. This means we get static checks, we ensure the value is correct at runtime, with the cost of introducing additional checks at runtime. Unfortunately, those checks may affect performance, depending on the complexity of the data structure and on how many times we cross the “dynamic &lt;-&gt; static” boundary.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: there is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.13831">recent research in using the runtime checks introduced by a gradual type system to provide compiler optimizations</a>. Some of these techniques are already leveraged by the Erlang VM to optimize code based on patterns and guards.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To summarize, we have three options:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Calling static code from dynamic code returns <code>dynamic()</code>, dropping the opportunity of further static typing checks (this is sound)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Calling static code from dynamic code returns the static types, potentially leading to mismatched types at runtime (this is unsound)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Calling static code from dynamic code returns the static types with additional runtime checks, unifying both behaviours but potentially impacting performance (this is sound)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="introducing-strong-arrows">Introducing strong arrows</h2>

<p>I have always said that Elixir, thanks to Erlang, is an assertive language. For example, if our identity function is restricted to only numbers, in practice we would most likely write it as:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>a</span> <span>when</span> <span>a:</span> <span>number</span><span>()</span>
<span>def</span> <span>identity</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>)</span> <span>when</span> <span>is_number</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>),</span> <span>do</span><span>:</span> <span>arg</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>In the example above, <code>identity</code> will fail if given any value that is not a number. We often rely on pattern matching and guards and, in turn, they helps us assert on the types we are working with. Not only that, Erlang’s JIT compiler already relies on this information to <a href="https://www.erlang.org/blog/type-based-optimizations-in-the-jit/">perform optimizations</a> whenever possible.</p>

<p>We also say Elixir is strongly typed because its functions and operators avoid implicit type conversions. The following functions also fail when their input does not match their type:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$</span> <span>binary</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>binary</span><span>()</span>
<span>def</span> <span>debug</span><span>(</span><span>string</span><span>),</span> <span>do</span><span>:</span> <span>"we got: "</span> <span>&lt;&gt;</span> <span>string</span>

<span>$</span> <span>(</span><span>integer</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>integer</span><span>())</span> <span>and</span> <span>(</span><span>float</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>float</span><span>())</span>
<span>def</span> <span>increment</span><span>(</span><span>number</span><span>),</span> <span>do</span><span>:</span> <span>number</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p><code>&lt;&gt;</code> only accepts binaries as arguments and will raise otherwise. <code>+</code> only accepts numbers (integers or floats) and will raise otherwise. <code>+</code> does not perform implicit conversions of non-numeric types, such as strings to number, as we can see next:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>iex</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>increment</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span>
<span>2</span>
<span>iex</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>)</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>increment</span><span>(</span><span>13.0</span><span>)</span>
<span>14.0</span>
<span>iex</span><span>(</span><span>3</span><span>)</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>increment</span><span>(</span><span>"foobar"</span><span>)</span>
<span>**</span> <span>(</span><span>ArithmeticError</span><span>)</span> <span>bad</span> <span>argument</span> <span>in</span> <span>arithmetic</span> <span>expression:</span> <span>"foobar"</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>In other words, Elixir’s runtime consistently checks the values and their types at runtime. If <code>increment</code> fails when given something else than a number, then it will fail when the <code>dynamic()</code> type does not match its input at runtime. This guarantees <code>increment</code> returns its declared type and therefore we do not need to introduce runtime type checks when calling said function from untyped code.</p>

<p>When we look at the <code>identity</code>, <code>debug</code>, and <code>increment</code> functions above, we - as developers - can state that these functions raise when given a value that does not match their input. However, how can we generalize this property so it is computed by the type system itself? To do so, we introduce a new concept called <strong>strong arrows</strong>, which relies on set-theoretical types to derive this property.</p>

<p>The idea goes as follows: a strong arrow is a function that can be statically proven that, when evaluated on values outside of its input types (i.e. its domain), it will error. For example, in our <code>increment</code> function, if we pass a <code>string()</code> as argument, it won’t type check, because <code>string() + integer()</code> is not a valid operation. Thanks to set-theoretic types, we can compute all values outside of the domain by computing the negation of a set. Given <code>increment/1</code> will fail for all types which are <code>not number()</code>, the function is strong.</p>

<p>By applying this rule to all typed functions, we will know which functions are strong and which ones are not. If a function is strong, the type system knows that calling it with a <code>dynamic()</code> type will always evaluate to its return type! Therefore we say the return type of <code>increment(dynamic())</code> is <code>number()</code>, which is sound and does not need further runtime checks!</p>

<p>Going back to our <code>debug</code> function, when used with a guarded identity, it will be able emit warnings at compile-time, errors at runtime, without introducing any additional runtime check:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>a</span> <span>when</span> <span>a:</span> <span>number</span><span>()</span>
<span>def</span> <span>identity</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>)</span> <span>when</span> <span>is_number</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>),</span> <span>do</span><span>:</span> <span>arg</span>

<span>def</span> <span>debug</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>)</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>"we got: "</span> <span>&lt;&gt;</span> <span>identity</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>However, if the <code>identity</code> function is not strong, then we must fallback to one of the strategies in the previous section.</p>

<p>Another powerful property of strong arrows is that they are composable. Let’s pick an example from the paper:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$</span> <span>number</span><span>(),</span> <span>number</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>number</span><span>()</span>
<span>def</span> <span>subtract</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>)</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>negate</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>$</span> <span>number</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>number</span><span>()</span>
<span>def</span> <span>negate</span><span>(</span><span>int</span><span>),</span> <span>do</span><span>:</span> <span>-</span><span>int</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>In the example above, <code>negate/1</code>’s type is a strong arrow, as it raises for any input outside of its domain. <code>subtract/2</code>’s type is also a strong arrow, because both <code>+</code> and our own <code>negate</code> are strong arrows too. This is an important capability as it limits how <code>dynamic()</code> types spread throughout the system.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Errata: my presentation used the type <code>integer()</code> instead of <code>number()</code> for the example above. However, that was a mistake in the slide. Giving the type <code>integer(), integer() -&gt; integer()</code> to <code>subtract</code> and <code>integer() -&gt; integer()</code> to <code>negate</code> does not make <code>subtract</code> a strong arrow. Can you tell why?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Luckily, other gradually typed languages can also leverage strong arrows. However, the more polymorphic a language and its functions are, the more unlikely it is to conclude that a given function is strong. For example, in other gradually typed languages such as Python or Ruby, the <code>+</code> operator is extensible and the user can define custom types where the operation is valid. In TypeScript, <code>"foobar" + 1</code> is also a valid operation, which expands the function domain. In both cases, an <code>increment</code> function restricted to numbers would not have a strong arrow type, as the operator won’t fail for all types outside of <code>number()</code>. Therefore, to remain sound, they must either restrict the operands with further runtime checks or return <code>dynamic()</code> (reducing the number of compile-time checks).</p>

<p>There is one last scenario to consider, which I did not include during my keynote for brevity. Take this function:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$</span> <span>integer</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>:ok</span>
<span>def</span> <span>receives_integer_and_returns_ok</span><span>(</span><span>_arg</span><span>),</span> <span>do</span><span>:</span> <span>:ok</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The function above can receive any type and return <code>:ok</code>. Is its type a strong arrow? Well, according to our definition, it is not. If we negate its input, type checking does not fail, it returns <code>:ok</code>.</p>

<p>However, given the return type is always the same, it should be a strong arrow! To do so, let’s amend and rephrase our definition of strong arrows: we negate the domain (i.e. the inputs) of a function and then type check it. If the function returns <code>none()</code> (i.e. it does not type check) or a type which is a subset of its codomain (i.e. its output), then it is a strong arrow.</p>

<h2 id="gradual-typing-and-false-positives">Gradual typing and false positives</h2>

<p>There is one last scenario we must take into consideration when interfacing dynamic and static code. Imagine the following code:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>increment_and_remainder</span><span>(</span><span>numerator</span><span>,</span> <span>denominator</span><span>)</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>rem</span><span>(</span><span>numerator</span><span>,</span> <span>increment</span><span>(</span><span>denominator</span><span>))</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>$</span> <span>(</span><span>integer</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>integer</span><span>())</span> <span>and</span> <span>(</span><span>float</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>float</span><span>())</span>
<span>def</span> <span>increment</span><span>(</span><span>number</span><span>),</span> <span>do</span><span>:</span> <span>number</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The <code>increment_and_remainder/2</code> function is untyped, therefore both of its arguments receive type <code>dynamic()</code>. The function then computes the remainder of the numerator by the denominator incremented by one. For this example, let’s assume all uses of <code>increment_and_remainder/2</code> in our program passes two integers as arguments.</p>

<p>Given <code>increment/1</code> has a strong arrow type, according to our definition, <code>increment(dynamic())</code> will return <code>integer() or float()</code> (also known as <code>number()</code>). Here lies the issue: if <code>increment(dynamic())</code> returns <code>integer() or float()</code>, the program above won’t type check because <code>rem/2</code> does not accept floats.</p>

<p>When faced with this problem, there are two possible reactions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>It is correct for the function to not type check given <code>increment</code> may return a float</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is incorrect for the function to not type check because the error it describes never occurs in the codebase</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Another interesting property of gradual set-theoretic types is that we can also place upper bounds on the <code>dynamic()</code> type. If a function returns <code>number()</code>, it means the caller needs to handle both <code>integer()</code> and <code>float()</code>. However, if a function returns <code>dynamic() and number()</code>, it means the type is defined at runtime, but it must still verify it is one of <code>integer()</code> or <code>float()</code> at compile time.</p>

<p>Therefore, <code>rem/2</code> will type check if its second argument has the type <code>dynamic() and number()</code>, as there is one type at runtime (<code>integer()</code>) that satisfies type checking. On the other hand, if you attempt to use the string concatenation operator (<code>&lt;&gt;</code>) on <code>dynamic() and number()</code>, then there is no acceptable runtime type and you’d still get a typing violation!</p>

<p>Going back to strong arrows, there are two possible return types from a strong arrow:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>A strong arrow, when presented with a dynamic type, returns its codomain</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A strong arrow, when presented with a dynamic type, returns the intersection of the codomain with the <code>dynamic()</code> type</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The second option opens up the possibility for existing codebases to gradually migrate to static types without dealing with false positives. Coming from a dynamic background, false positives can be seen as noisy or as an indication that static types are not worth the trouble. With strong arrows and gradual set-theoretic types, we will be able to explore different trade-offs on mixed codebases. Which of the two choices above we will adopt as a default and how to customize them is yet to be decided. It will depend on the community feedback as we experiment and integrate the type system.</p>

<p>Erlang and Elixir developers who use Dialyzer will be familiar with these trade-offs, as the second option mirrors Dialyzer’s behaviour of no false positives. The difference here is that our semantics are integrated into a complete type system. If no type signature is present, the <code>dynamic()</code> type is used, and we will leverage the techniques described here to interface dynamic and static code. If a function has a type signature, and no <code>dynamic()</code> type is present, then it will behave as statically typed code when called with statically typed arguments. Migrating to static types will naturally reduce the interaction points between dynamic and static code, removing the reliance on the <code>dynamic()</code> type.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>Set-theoretic types allow us to express many typing features based on set operations of union, intersection, and negation.</p>

<p>In particular, we have been exploring a gradual set-theoretic type system for Elixir, paying special attention to how the type system will integrate with existing codebases and how it can best leverage the semantics of the Erlang Virtual Machine. The type system will also perform limited inference based on patterns and guards (as described in the paper), which - in addition to strong arrows - we hope to bring some of the benefits of static typing to codebases without changing a single line of code.</p>

<p>While our efforts have officially moved from research into development, and <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2023/06/22/type-system-updates-research-dev/">we have outlined an implementation plan</a>, we haven’t yet fully implemented nor assessed the usability of set-theoretic types in existing Elixir codebases, nor large nor small. There is much to implement and validate, and we don’t rule the possibility of finding unforeseen deal breakers that could send us back to square one. Yet we are pleased and cautiously excited with the new developments so far.</p>

<p>Re-Logic</p>
<p>The team at Re-Logic has been watching the recent events surrounding Unity with both interest and sadness. The loss of a formerly-leading and user-friendly game engine to the darker forces that negatively impact so much of the gaming industry has left us dismayed to put it mildly. While we do not personally use Unity outside of a few elements on our console/mobile platforms), we feel like we cannot sit idly by as these predatory moves are made against studios everywhere.</p>
<p>We unequivocally condemn and reject the recent TOS/fee changes proposed by Unity and the underhanded way they were rolled out. The flippant manner with which years of trust cultivated by Unity were cast aside for yet another way to squeeze publishers, studios, and gamers is the saddest part. That this move was wholly unnecessary pushes things into the tragedy category - a cautionary tale the industry will not soon forget.</p>
<p>We do not feel that a simple public statement is sufficient. Even if Unity were to recant their policies and statements, the destruction of trust is not so easily repaired. We strongly feel that it is now equally important to get behind some of the other up-and-coming open source game engines. Lighting some candles in an otherwise dark moment. To that end, we are donating $100,000 to each of the open source engines listed below.</p>
<p>Additionally, we are sponsoring each of these projects with $1,000/month each moving forward. All we ask in return is that they remain good people and keep doing all that they can to make these engines powerful and approachable for developers everywhere.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>On a Saturday night, a security engineer at Equifax was updating an SSL certificate on a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS). Immediately after, suspicious connections were detected. After a more in-depth investigation, it became evident that the situation was far graver than anticipated. A service had to be promptly shut down to prevent further exploitation, but by that point, the damage was already done. Malicious actors had been exfiltrating data for several months and had already collected personal information from 163 million customers.</p><h2 id="how-it-happened"><span>How It Happened</span><a href="#how-it-happened"><i></i></a></h2><h3 id="initial-access"><span>Initial Access</span><a href="#initial-access"><i></i></a></h3><p>The story begins in March 2017 with the disclosure of a vulnerability in the Apache Struts software, tracked as <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2017-5638">CVE-2017-5638</a>. This security flaw allowed threat actors to achieve remote code execution on a server by crafting a specific <code>Content-Type</code> HTTP header.

It was a legacy application built in the 1970s that customers used to dispute incorrect credit information.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://hardfault.life/p/organic-maps-review">https://hardfault.life/p/organic-maps-review</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37592712">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A couple weeks ago while perusing Hacker News, I came across an open-source maps app
called <a href="https://organicmaps.app/">Organic Maps</a>. Proudly billing itself as privacy-focused and
open-source, Organic Maps’ website claims that it is “one of a few applications
nowadays that supports 100% of features without an active internet connection.”</p>
<h2>A World’s Worth Of Doubts</h2>
<p>Map apps are complicated. They must handle tons and tons of road
data. That data has to be accurate - even the most complex interchanges must be
charted correctly. That data needs to be kept up-to-date with information about
closures and other conditions. The routing algorithm has to be effective enough
to get the user to their destination in a safe and timely manner. It also can’t
just sit there saying “recalculating” for minutes on end every time you make a
wrong turn.</p>
<p>Google Maps, Apple Maps, and Waze have elevated the average person’s expectations for a maps app.
15 years ago, a little Garmin GPS mounted to your windshield would give
simple “turn left, turn right” commands using data loaded to an SD card. Today,
a maps app must know if there is traffic ahead, and re-route you accordingly.
It must know which lane(s) you need to use to make a turn. It must know if
there is a state trooper hiding around the corner with a radar gun. It must
know about speed cameras, stalled vehicles, and construction, and all of this
data must be received in real time… right?</p>
<h2>Organic Maps Under Pressure</h2>
<p>I had an emergency last week that requried me to drive more than 300 miles into
the rural Midwest with my fiancee. Having learned of this emergency mere minutes
after reading about Organic Maps, I decided to install the app and put it to
the test on this sudden road trip.</p>
<p>My first stop was downtown Chicago, where I would pick up my fiancee before
leaving the city. I didn’t need the app for this part of the drive, but I
figured it would make a good sanity check. Thankfully, Organic Maps gave me a
sane route that used the interstate and major streets competently.</p>
<p>I was pleased initially, but then I looked at its ETA: 4 minutes! To drive 5
miles! In Chicago! As it turns out, Organic Maps has no traffic data. I already
felt like I had made a mistake by even giving this thing a try. If it doesn’t
know about traffic, then surely
it will be worthless in one of the largest and most congested cities in the
United States!</p>
<p>I opened Google Maps to compare. Google happily presented me with
long stretches of red, indicating the heavy traffic that I knew was there. It
estimated that I would take 14 minutes to arrive downtown (it was right). Yet,
Google chose the same route as Organic Maps. <strong>Google’s traffic data offered me
a much more accurate arrival time, but Google Maps couldn’t actually get me to my
destination faster than Organic Maps.</strong></p>
<p>As it turns out, this wasn’t a fluke. Google Maps and Waze altered our
expectations for a map app’s capabilities, without actually getting
us to our destinations faster. <a href="https://trid.trb.org/view/1495267">This study</a> indicates that modern maps apps
haven’t magically gotten rid of traffic jams, though they have managed to clog up
local streets that didn’t see heavy traffic before. Other sources agree with
this conclusion, including <a href="https://citymonitor.ai/community/neighbourhoods/google-maps-local-traffic">this article from City Monitor</a> that cites some
fascinating UK Department of Transport data. The Atlantic also has
<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/03/mapping-apps-and-the-price-of-anarchy/555551/">a great writeup</a> on the topic.
Even the most clever of traffic-aware apps can’t get you to your destination a
whole lot faster than a “dumb” app. Traffic is sort of like
energy: you can move it around, but you can’t get rid of it.</p>
<h2>The First Drive</h2>
<p>My impression of Organic Maps immediately improved when I started driving. It
talks! It knows exit numbers! It can tell you which lanes to use! Sure, it isn’t
as polished as Google Maps, but all of the functionality is present. The UI is
high-contrast and easy to read, although I wish the text showing exit
numbers/street names was a little bigger. When you’re simply on the road and
following directions, Organic Maps feels every bit as intuitive as Google Maps.</p>
<p>As my fiancee and I prepared to set off into the boonies, I plugged in the address of our
hotel. About 45 seconds later, Organic Maps returned the 300-mile route to
our destination. It can take a lot longer to calculate longer routes using your
phone’s processor instead of a huge cloud server. It didn’t really bother me
though; 45 seconds is nothing compared to the 6-hour trip ahead. If that’s the
cost of using a maps app that doesn’t spray your personal data all over the
internet, I’ll pay it.</p>
<h2>Heading Into The Boonies</h2>
<p>This drive is familiar to me. As a child, I saw these same roads drift by from
the backseat of a minivan. This was before smartphones and tablets
were in the hands of every child in the country, so I actually paid
attention to the road signs, the condition of each highway, and the
subtle changes in the natural environment. I know those long stretches of the
rural Midwest like a child knows their hometown, through a mental map as vivid
as it is inaccurate.</p>
<p>As we sliced through miles of picturesque nothingness, Organic Maps blended
seamlessly into the background. As interstates gave way to state numbered highways, Organic Maps’
charmingly robotic voice prompted me a couple thousand feet in advance of each
turn. As state numbered highways gave way to county roads, Organic Maps
avoided dirt roads that would look like shortcuts to the uninformed. When the
sun fell below the horizon, Organic Maps switched to a dark mode that prevented
my phone’s screen from blinding me as a drove.</p>
<p>Organic Maps was at its best on this long drive. After I stopped for gas in
a town with no cell service, I had no trouble getting my maps back. Organic
Maps doesn’t need an internet connection to route you to your destination. This
no-network-necessary approach means that you don’t have to fear losing your
route when cell service isn’t available. This feature alone is enough reason to
keep it installed on your phone, just in case you need it.</p>
<h2>Putting a Town On The Map</h2>
<p>Organic Maps performed exceptionally well while driving through rural America,
but once I arrived at my destination, it struggled. This
town isn’t small (technically it qualifies as a city!), and it’s well-known within
its state, yet there were dozens of businesses missing from the map. Many of the
missing businesses weren’t new either - at least a few
have been around for over a decade, yet somehow never made it into
Organic Maps’ database. I could only find my hotel by address; Organic Maps
knew the address, but didn’t know that there was a hotel there.</p>
<p>Organic Maps uses an open map database called <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a>. Although
OpenStreetMap has very accurate data about streets, addresses, and highways,
its knowledge of what’s actually located at any given address is spotty at best.
Thankfully, Organic Maps has a half-solution to this problem: contribute OpenStreetMap data
yourself! Organic Maps lets you contribute data to OpenStreetMap. Simply press
and hold where the business should be, tap “add a place to the map,” and fill
out the form. I ended up spending an hour of downtime adding information about
various restaurants, libraries, museums, and stores around town. It
would take far longer to add every business in the area, but it’s a good start.
I love being able to contribute to OpenStreetMap, and Organic Maps makes it easy
to do that.</p>
<h2>Fumbling The ITR</h2>
<p>If you need to come into downtown Chicago from the east, there are two ways you
can go. The expensive way is to take I-90 via the Indiana Toll Road (“ITR” for
short) and Chicago Skyway. The cheap way is to take I-94 south to the I-80/I-294
interchange. Both routes eventually put you on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Ryan_Expressway">the Dan Ryan</a>, a 14-lane
behemoth heading straight into the heart of the city. Just writing about the
ITR makes my skin crawl, and apparently it also makes Organic Maps upset.</p>
<p>Nearing the end of the drive home, as my impending merge onto the ITR loomed,
Organic Maps did something strange. It told me to take the wrong ramp, which
would have put me on the ITR heading west, then make a U-turn and head
east. I know this drive well enough to know it was asking me to do something
physically impossible. So, I did what I had been trying to avoid the entire
weekend: I disobeyed Organic Maps. I took the correct ramp, Organic Maps quickly
recalculated, and everything went back to normal.</p>
<p>I tried re-creating this problem a couple days later, and Organic Maps did it
again! Here is the incorrect route:</p>
<p><img src="https://hardfault.life/public/organic-maps-review/organic-bad-route.png" alt="Screenshot of the Organic Maps app showing an incorrect route"></p>
<p>Notice the little kink in the route near the top-right corner of the image -
that’s a U-turn that doesn’t actually exist. Even more bizarre is that
the <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a> website gets the correct route:</p>
<p><img src="https://hardfault.life/public/organic-maps-review/osm-correct-route.png" alt="Screenshot of the OpenStreetMap web app showing the correct route"></p>
<p>This shook my confidence in Organic Maps, but after more than 1000 miles of
otherwise worry-free routing, this seemed to be a one-off bug. I created an
<a href="https://github.com/organicmaps/organicmaps/issues/5983">issue on GitHub</a> and the developers responded swiftly. Unfortunately, it can
take a few weeks for an OpenStreetMap update to get pushed out, so now I
(and anyone else driving westbound into Chicago) must wait for the new, more
accurate map data.</p>
<h2>Returning Home</h2>
<p>Organic Maps has proven itself to be a competent alternative to Google Maps,
at least for my purposes. Its UI is simple and intuitive. Organic Maps gets me
to my destinations as quickly and safely as Google Maps, even though it doesn’t
have Google’s extensive traffic data. Organic Maps isn’t operated by megacorp
trying to make you buy things.</p>
<p>Organic Maps is certainly not for everyone. If you are constantly
running out of storage space on your phone, Organic Maps’ need to download
hundreds of megabytes of map data onto your phone will be a non-starter. On the
other hand, its offline map storage means that it doesn’t need an internet
connection to get you to your destination.</p>
<p>Incorrect or missing businesses are the biggest inconvenience of using Organic Maps.
I occasionally switch back to Google Maps when a business or address is missing.
In this regard, Organic Maps can only improve if people use it. If your destination
is missing, add it. If some information is out of date, update it. I would
strongly encourage anyone to try Organic Maps for a week or two. I gave it an
honest chance, and it made a lasting impression.</p>

  <div><p><span>The U.K. Parliament </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uks-online-safety-bill-passed-by-parliament-2023-09-19/"><span>has passed the Online Safety Bill</span></a><span> (OSB), which says it will make the U.K. “the safest place” in the world to be online. In reality, the OSB will lead to a much more censored, locked-down internet for British users. The bill could empower the government to undermine not just the privacy and security of U.K. residents, but <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/08/if-you-build-it-they-will-come-apple-has-opened-backdoor-increased-surveillance">internet users worldwide</a>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b>A Backdoor That Undermines Encryption</b></h3>
<p><span>A clause of the bill allows Ofcom, the British telecom regulator, to serve a notice requiring tech companies to scan their users–all of them–for child abuse content.This would&nbsp;affect&nbsp;even messages and files that are end-to-end encrypted to protect user privacy. As enacted, the OSB allows the government to force companies to build technology that can scan regardless of encryption–in other words, build a backdoor.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>These types of </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/11/why-adding-client-side-scanning-breaks-end-end-encryption"><span>client-side scanning systems</span></a><span> amount to </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.07450"><span>“Bugs in Our Pockets,”</span></a><span> and a group of leading computer security experts has reached the same conclusion as EFF–they undermine privacy and security for everyone. That’s why EFF has </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/07/uk-government-very-close-eroding-encryption-worldwide"><span>strongly opposed the OSB</span></a><span> for </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/08/uks-online-safety-bill-attacks-free-speech-and-encryption"><span>years</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It’s a basic human right to have a private conversation. This right is even more important for the most vulnerable people. If the U.K. uses its new powers to scan people’s data, lawmakers will damage&nbsp;the security people need to protect themselves from harassers, data thieves, authoritarian governments, and others. Paradoxically, U.K. lawmakers have created these new risks in the name of online safety.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The U.K. government has </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/09/uk-government-knows-how-extreme-online-safety-bill"><span>made some recent statements</span></a><span> </span><span>indicating that it actually realizes that getting around end-to-end encryption isn’t compatible with protecting user privacy. But given the text of the law, neither the government’s private statements to tech companies, nor its weak public assurances, are enough to protect the human rights of British people or internet users around the world.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b>Censorship and Age-Gating</b></h3>
<p><span>Online platforms will be expected to remove content that the U.K. government views as inappropriate for children. If they don’t, they’ll face heavy penalties. The problem is, in the U.K. as in the U.S., </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/08/us-government-about-control-speech-online-protect-kids"><span>people do not agree about what type of content is harmful for kids</span></a><span>. Putting that decision in the hands of government regulators will lead to politicized censorship decisions.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The OSB will also lead to </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/03/age-verification-mandates-would-undermine-anonymity-online"><span>harmful age-verification systems</span></a><span>. This violates fundamental principles about anonymous and simple access that has existed since the beginning of the Internet. You shouldn’t have to show your ID to get online. Age-gating systems meant to keep out kids invariably lead to adults losing their rights to private speech, and anonymous speech, which is sometimes necessary.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In the coming months, we’ll be watching what type of regulations the U.K. government publishes describing how it will use these new powers to regulate the internet. If the regulators claim their right to require the creation of dangerous backdoors in encrypted services, we expect encrypted messaging services to </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/27/an-encryption-exodus-looms-over-uks-online-safety-bill/"><span>keep their promises</span></a><span> and withdraw from the U.K. if that nation’s government&nbsp;compromises their ability to protect other users.&nbsp;</span></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="textcore-ce5d68a1d8">
    <p>Real median household income after taxes fell 8.8% to $64,240 from 2021 to 2022 and the poverty rate after taxes as measured by the Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) increased 59% to 12.4%.</p>
<p>These significant changes in <i>after-tax</i> income and poverty rates of U.S. households were much larger than the annual changes in <i>before-tax</i> income and poverty, according to U.S. Census Bureau data released today.</p>

</div><div>
<p>The expiration of expansions to refundable tax credits had a particularly important impact on SPM poverty.</p>

    

</div><div id="textcore-824ce80faa">
    <p>The Census Bureau reports, <i>Income in the United States: 2022 </i>and <i>Poverty in the United States: 2022</i>, show that <i>before</i> taxes, median household income declined 2.3% to $74,580 and the poverty rate (11.5%), as measured by the official poverty measure, was not statistically different from 2021.</p>
<p>This dramatic difference can be attributed to key changes in federal tax policy.</p>
<p>In 2022, several policies enacted by the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/american-rescue-plan/" target="_blank">American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA)</a> expired, including an expansion of the <a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/changes-to-the-earned-income-tax-credit-for-the-2022-filing-season" target="_blank">Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)</a> for filers without children and full refundability of the <a href="https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/2021-child-tax-credit-and-advance-child-tax-credit-payments-topic-c-calculation-of-the-2021-child-tax-credit" target="_blank">Child Tax Credit (CTC)</a> and <a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/child-and-dependent-care-credit-faqs" target="_blank">Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit (CDCTC)</a>. ARPA also increased the maximum amount of CTC.</p>
<p>In 2020 and 2021, most households also received <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/coronavirus/assistance-for-american-families-and-workers/economic-impact-payments" target="_blank">Economic Impact Payments (EIP)</a> that were no longer issued in 2022.</p>
<p>The rollback of these tax policies had the largest effect on post-tax income among the nation’s lowest-income households.</p>
<p>In 2021, for example, post-tax income at the 10th percentile, meaning at the bottom of the income distribution, was 17.1% <i>higher</i> than the corresponding pretax income estimate, reflecting the substantial boost that lower-income households received that year from the EIP and expanded CTC.</p>
<p>In contrast, the 2022 estimates of pretax and post-tax income at the 10th percentile were not significantly different (Figure 1).</p>
<p>Lower post-tax income, particularly at the bottom of the income distribution, also resulted in an increase in income inequality.</p>
<p>The Gini index, a common measure of how spread out or unequal incomes are, for pretax income was 1.2% lower in 2022 than in 2021, reflecting real income declines at the top of the income distribution. However, the post-tax Gini index was 3.2% higher due to substantial declines in post-tax income among lower-income households.</p>

</div><div id="textcore-44a48ec46d">
    <p>The decline in post-tax income also corresponds to an increase in the SPM, which incorporates noncash government assistance programs like the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP) and taxes, through income and payroll taxes and refundable tax credits like the CTC and EITC. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The 4.6 percentage point increase in the SPM poverty rate was driven almost entirely by the change in tax policy (Figure 2). &nbsp;When a version of the SPM excluding taxes is examined, the poverty rate did not change: 12.6% in 2022, not statistically different from 2021.</p>

</div><div id="textcore-a1e0b57298">
    <p>The expiration of expansions to refundable tax credits had a particularly important impact on SPM poverty (Figure 3).</p>
<p>In 2021, 9.6 million people were kept out of poverty due to refundable tax credits. This number declined to 6.4 million in 2022 as the pandemic era expansions expired. The effect declined for each of the major age groups, with 3.5 million children lifted out of poverty in 2022 compared to 4.9 million in 2021.</p>

<p>The LTS (long-term support) period for the Linux kernel is being cut down. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/09/android-users-rejoice-linux-kernel-lts-releases-are-now-good-for-6-years/">In 2017</a>, the kernel jumped from two years of support to six. Now, six years later, it turns out that's a lot of work. <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/long-term-support-for-linux-kernel-to-be-cut-as-maintainence-remains-under-strain/">ZDNet</a> reports that at the Open Source Summit Europe this week (videos will be out in a few weeks), <a href="https://lwn.net/">Linux Weekly News</a> executive editor Jonathan Corbet announced the Linux kernel will return to two years of LTS support.</p>
<p>The plan to cut back down to two years isn't instant. The Linux community is still honoring the <a href="https://www.kernel.org/category/releases.html">current end-of-life timelines</a>, so 6.1, 5.15, 5.10, 5.4, 4.19, and 4.14 are still six years, but new kernels will only get two years. Even this six-year window was supposed to be an optional thing when it started, with the release page FAQ saying, "Each new longterm kernel usually starts with only a 2-year projected EOL that can be extended further if there is enough interest from the industry at large to help support it for a longer period of time." The reality was that everything received a six-year life span, and now that will no longer be the case.</p>
<p>Corbet cited a mix of lack of use and a lack of support for why Linux is cutting back on LTS kernels. Corbet says, "There's really no point to maintaining [old kernels] for that long because people are not using them." The other big problem is the burnout from maintainers, which are often unpaid and could use a lot more support from the billion-dollar companies that benefit from using Linux.</p>                                            
                                                        
<h2>But what about Android?</h2>
<p>Two years seems like a fine support window for PCs, but what about Android? The original LTS extension was mainly made with Android and Internet of Things devices in mind—it was announced during an Android Linux talk by Google developer Iliyan Malchev. The problem was that on PCs, two years only represents the time between kernel <em>updates</em>, so that's a fine timeline. Embedded devices tend not to update the kernel, though, so those "two years" represent most of the development cycle and the entire consumer support window, and that's not long enough.</p>

<p>The original picture Google painted in 2017 was that phones take two years to be developed and that the kernel is locked in near the beginning of the engineering process. The LTS kernel would be hitting end-of-life right around when the phone finally shipped, and customers would use obsolete kernels for the lifetime of their devices. The Android kernel development process is a whole pile of forks: First, Google forks from a new Linux LTS to make the "Android Common" kernel, then that is sent to SoC vendors like Qualcomm and forked for each model of SoC, then <em>that</em> fork is sent to device makers, which fork it again for each model of device. It takes a while.</p>
<p>Are things better in 2023? I don't know about that. The Android kernel docs have a Linux "<a href="https://source.android.com/docs/core/architecture/kernel/android-common#compatibility-matrix">compatibility matrix</a>" for each version of Android, and Android 14—releasing any day now—still supports launching new devices with Linux 5.4, a 4-year-old kernel. That's going to <em>start</em> a new window of support, remember, so even with a paltry two years of ownership, that's a six-year-old kernel. That's also just for new devices. You can upgrade to Android 14 from Linux 4.14, which goes back to 2017. You can see how Google arrived at the six-year number. It's hard to know what every cheap Android phone is doing at any given time, but I assume these are all supported because they are still needed.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>There are also smartwatches to consider, where things are even worse. The Pixel Watch is so ashamed of its Linux kernel that it's not even listed in the settings, but the device launched in 2022 with <a href="https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1580695517763276800/photo/1">Linux kernel 4.19</a>, a 4-year-old kernel at the time.</p>
<figure><img alt="Android's GKI has a bunch of modules for hardware support that you can plug into the kernel. " src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/generic-kernel-image-architecture.png" width="740" height="395"><figcaption><p>Android's GKI has a bunch of modules for hardware support that you can plug into the kernel. </p><p>Google</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>Android's big advancement since 2017 is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/11/android-12-the-ars-technica-review/3/">the GKI</a>, Google's "Generic Kernel Image," which cuts down on the "fork of a fork of a fork" Android kernel development process. That first fork, Android Common, adds all the Android compatibility stuff to Linux, so that still happens with the GKI, but fork No. 2 and 3 are for hardware compatibility, and the GKI instead moves those to modules. Further out, there is a plan to move to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/09/android-to-take-an-upstream-first-development-model-for-the-linux-kernel/">mainline Linux.&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>Even GKI phones still don't do major kernel updates, though. You get minor LTS security updates, but the Pixel 6, the first GKI phone, launched with Linux 5.10 and is still on Linux 5.10. That's a 3-year-old kernel. If this trend keeps up, when it gets its last security update in 2027, it will have a 7-year-old kernel. Google <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/09/the-android-11-interview-googlers-answer-our-burning-questions/2/">has said</a> before that major GKI kernel updates are in the plans eventually. There's even mention of <a href="https://source.android.com/docs/core/architecture/kernel/gki-faq">major kernel swaps</a> in the documents, but the landmark of updating a production consumer device to a major new GKI version is not something that has happened yet. <a href="https://9to5google.com/2023/08/28/google-pixel-8-android-os-updates/">Rumor has it</a> that the Pixel 8 will have a longer support window, so maybe we'll see major kernel updates launch with that phone.</p>

        <p>OR</p><p>The story of how a misplaced decimal point at Alameda Research caused a market crash that echoed around the world.</p><p>This incident happened just a few weeks after I joined Alameda. I had just gotten a hang of our engineering workflows and was starting to wrap my head around our trading systems.At a high level, Alameda's trading operated in two modes:</p><p>The main one was our semi-systematic strategies, where traders set model parameters that control a complex automated trading system. This way, traders aren't placing actual trades, but rather fine-tuning an algorithm that decides how to execute those trades at high frequency.</p><p>However every once in a while, a trader would need to manually execute a trade. Usually this might happen if our automated trading systems were being buggy due to market volatility, or if there was an arbitrage opportunity on a venue where we hadn't set up automated trading yet.</p><p>Our automated trading systems handled the vast majority of Alameda's trading. So naturally, we had sanity checks in place to make sure that the orders being sent were reasonable relative to current market prices. Not so for manual trades, which were by nature discretionary.</p><p>The tricky thing about risk is that it's usually invisible, right up until it comes around and bites you in the ass.</p><p>Well, on October 21 2021, an Alameda trader's finger slipped.</p><p>The trader was trying to sell a block of BTC in response to news, and sent out the order via our manual trading system.

</p></div><div><p>One year ago, we published a hypothesis that generative AI would become a profound platform shift in technology. Then came the firestorm.</p></div></div></section>



<section>
<p>Scientists, historians and economists have long studied the optimal conditions that create a Cambrian explosion of innovation. In generative AI, we have reached a modern marvel, our generation’s space race.</p>



<p>This moment has been decades in the making. Six decades of Moore’s Law has given us the compute horsepower to process exaflops of data. Four decades of the internet (accelerated by COVID) has given us trillions of tokens’ worth of training data. Two decades of mobile and cloud computing has given every human a supercomputer in the palm of our hands. In other words, decades of technological progress have accumulated to create the necessary conditions for generative AI to take flight.</p>



<p>ChatGPT’s rise was the spark that lit the fuse, unleashing a density and fervor of innovation that we have not seen in years—perhaps since the early days of the internet. The breathless excitement was especially visceral in “Cerebral Valley,” where AI researchers reached rockstar status and hacker houses were filled to the brim each weekend with new autonomous agents and companionship chatbots. AI researchers transformed from the proverbial “hacker in the garage” to special forces units commanding billions of dollars of compute. The arXiv printing press has become so prolific that researchers have jokingly called for a pause on new publications so they can catch up.</p>



<p>But quickly, AI excitement turned to borderline hysteria. Suddenly, every company was an “AI copilot.” Our inboxes got filled up with undifferentiated pitches for “AI Salesforce” and “AI Adobe” and “AI Instagram.” The $100M pre-product seed round returned. We found ourselves in an unsustainable feeding frenzy of fundraising, talent wars and GPU procurement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And sure enough, the cracks started to show. Artists and writers and singers challenged the legitimacy of machine-generated IP. Debates over ethics, regulation and looming superintelligence consumed Washington. And perhaps most worryingly, a whisper began to spread within Silicon Valley that generative AI was not actually useful. The products were falling far short of expectations, as evidenced by terrible user retention. End user demand began to plateau for many applications. Was this just another vaporware cycle?</p>



<p>The AI summer of discontent has sent critics gleefully grave dancing, reminiscent of the early days of the internet, where in 1998 one famous economist declared “By 2005, it will become clear that the Internet’s impact on the economy has been no greater than the fax machine’s.”</p>



<p>Make no mistake—despite the noise and the hysteria and the air of uncertainty and discontent,&nbsp; generative AI has already had a more successful start than SaaS, with &gt;$1 billion in revenue from startups alone (it took the SaaS market years, not months, to reach the same scale). Some applications have become household names: ChatGPT became the fastest-growing application with particularly strong product-market fit among students and developers; Midjourney became our collective creative muse and was reported to have reached hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue with a team of just eleven; and Character popularized AI entertainment and companionship and created the consumer “social” application we craved the most—with users spending two hours on average in-app.</p>



<p>Nonetheless, these early signs of success don’t change the reality that a lot of AI companies simply do not have product-market fit or a sustainable competitive advantage, and that the overall ebullience of the AI ecosystem is unsustainable.</p>



<p>Now that the dust has settled for a bit, we thought it would be an opportune moment to zoom out and reflect on generative AI—where we find ourselves today, and where we’re possibly headed.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-towards-act-two">Towards Act Two</h2>



<p>Generative AI’s first year out the gate—“Act 1”—came from the <em>technology-out</em>. We discovered a new “hammer”—foundation models—and unleashed a wave of novelty apps that were lightweight demonstrations of cool new technology.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We now believe the market is entering “Act 2”—which will be from the <em>customer-back</em>. Act 2 will solve human problems end-to-end. These applications are different in nature than the first apps out of the gate. They tend to use foundation models as a piece of a more comprehensive solution rather than the entire solution. They introduce new editing interfaces, making the workflows stickier and the outputs better. They are often multi-modal.</p>



<p>The market is already beginning to transition from “Act 1” to “Act 2.” Examples of companies entering “Act 2” include <a href="http://harvey.ai/">Harvey</a>, which is building custom LLMs for elite law firms; <a href="http://glean.com/">Glean</a>, which is crawling and indexing our workspaces to make Generative AI more relevant at work; and <a href="http://character.ai/">Character</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ava-your-digital-friend/id6446257579">Ava</a>, which are creating digital companions.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-market-map">Market Map</h2>



<p>Our updated generative AI market map is below.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unlike last year’s map, we have chosen to organize this map by use case rather than by model modality. This reflects two important thrusts in the market: Generative AI’s evolution from technology hammer to actual use cases and value, and the increasingly multimodal nature of generative AI applications.</p>

<h2>Revisiting Our Thesis</h2>



<p>Our original <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/generative-ai-a-creative-new-world/">essay</a> laid out a thesis for the generative AI market opportunity and a hypothesis for how the market would unfold. How did we do?</p>



<p>Here’s what we got wrong:</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>Things happened quickly.</strong> Last year, we anticipated it would be nearly a decade before we had intern-level code generation, Hollywood-quality videos or human quality speech that didn’t sound mechanical. But a quick listen to Eleven Labs’ voices on TikTok or Runway’s AI film festival makes it clear that the future has arrived at warp speed. Even 3D models, gaming and music are becoming good, <em>quickly</em>.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>The bottleneck is on the supply side. </strong>We did not anticipate the extent to which end user demand would outstrip GPU supply. The bottleneck to many companies’ growth quickly became not customer demand but access to the latest GPUs from Nvidia. Long wait times became the norm, and a simple business model emerged: pay a subscription fee to skip the line and access better models.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Vertical separation hasn’t happened yet</strong>. We still believe that there will be a separation between the “application layer” companies and foundation model providers, with model companies specializing in scale and research and application layer companies specializing in product and UI. In reality, that separation hasn’t cleanly happened yet. In fact, the most successful user-facing applications out of the gate have been vertically integrated.</li>



<li><strong>Cutthroat competitive environment and swiftness of the incumbent response.</strong> Last year, there were a few overcrowded categories of the competitive landscape (notably image generation and copywriting), but by and large the market was whitespace. Today, many corners of the competitive landscape have more competition than opportunity. The swiftness of the incumbent response, from Google’s Duet and Bard to Adobe’s Firefly—and the willingness of incumbents to finally go “risk on”—has magnified the competitive heat. Even in the foundation model layer, we are seeing customers set up their infrastructure to be agnostic between different vendors.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>The moats are in the customers, not the data. </strong>We predicted that the best generative AI companies could generate a sustainable competitive advantage through a data flywheel: more usage → more data → better model → more usage. While this is still somewhat true, especially in domains with very specialized and hard-to-get data, the “data moats” are on shaky ground: the data that application companies generate does not create an insurmountable moat, and the next generations of foundation models may very well obliterate any data moats that startups generate. Rather, <em>workflows</em> and <em>user networks</em> seem to be creating more durable sources of competitive advantage.</li>
</ol>



<p>Here’s what we got right:</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>Generative AI is a thing. </strong>Suddenly, every developer was working on a generative AI application and every enterprise buyer was demanding it. The market even kept the “generative AI” moniker. Talent flowed into the market, as did venture capital dollars. Generative AI even became a pop culture phenomenon in viral videos like “Harry Potter Balenciaga” or the Drake imitation song “Heart on My Sleeve” by Ghostwriter which has become a chart-topping hit.</li>



<li><strong>The first killer apps emerged</strong>. It’s been well documented that ChatGPT was the fastest application to reach 100M MAU—and it did so organically in just 6 weeks. By contrast, Instagram took 2.5 years, WhatsApp took 3.5 years, and YouTube and Facebook took 4 years to reach that level of user demand. But ChatGPT is not an isolated phenomenon. The depth of engagement of Character AI (2 hour average session time), the productivity benefits of Github Copilot (55% more efficient), and the monetization path of Midjourney (hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue) all suggest that the first cohort of killer apps has arrived.</li>



<li><strong>Developers are the key</strong>. One of the core insights of developer-first companies like Stripe or Unity has been that developer access opens up use cases you could not even imagine. In the last several quarters, we have been pitched everything from music generation communities to AI matchmakers to AI customer support agents.</li>



<li><strong>The form factor is evolving. </strong>The first versions of AI applications have largely been autocomplete and first drafts, but these form factors are now growing in complexity. Midjourney’s introduction of camera panning and infilling is a nice illustration of how the generative AI-first user experience has grown richer. Across the board, form factors are evolving from individual to system-level productivity and from human-in-the-loop to execution-oriented agentic systems.</li>



<li><strong>Copyright and ethics and existential dread</strong>. The debate has roared on these hot-button topics. Artists and writers and musicians are split, with some creators rightfully outraged that others are profiting off derivative work, and some creators embracing the new AI reality (Grimes’ profit-sharing proposition and James Buckhouse’s optimism about becoming part of the <a href="https://buckhouse.medium.com/augmented-imagination-a3f4519f9784">creative genome</a> come to mind). No startup wants to be the <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90942310/ai-napster-who-going-to-own-it-next">Napster or Limewire to the eventual Spotify</a> (h/t Jason Boehmig). The rules are opaque: Japan has declared that content used to train AI has no IP rights, while Europe has proposed heavy-handed regulation.&nbsp;</li>

<h2>Where do we stand now? Generative AI’s Value Problem</h2>



<p>Generative AI is not lacking in use cases or customer demand. Users crave AI that makes their jobs easier and their work products better, which is why they have flocked to applications in record-setting droves (in spite of a lack of natural distribution).&nbsp;</p>

<p>But do people stick around? Not really. The below chart compares the month 1 mobile app retention of AI-first applications to existing companies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>User engagement is also lackluster. Some of the best consumer companies have 60-65% DAU/MAU; WhatsApp’s is 85%. By contrast, generative AI apps have a median of 14% (with the notable exception of Character and the “AI companionship” category). This means that users are not finding enough value in Generative AI products to use them every day yet.</p>

<p>In short, generative AI’s biggest problem is not finding use cases or demand or distribution, it is proving value. As our colleague David Cahn writes, “the <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/follow-the-gpus-perspective/">$200B question</a> is: What are you going to use all this infrastructure to do? How is it going to change people’s lives?” The path to building enduring businesses will require fixing the retention problem and generating deep enough value for customers that they stick and become daily active users.</p>



<p>Let’s not despair. Generative AI is still in its “awkward teenage years.” There are glimpses of brilliance, and when the products fall short of expectations the failures are often reliable, repeatable and fixable. Our work is cut out for us.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Act Two: A Shared Playbook</h2>



<p>Founders are embarking on the hard work of prompt engineering, fine tuning and dataset curation to make their AI products *good*. Brick by brick, they are building flashy demos into whole product experiences. And meanwhile, the foundation model substrate continues to brim with research and innovation.</p>



<p>A shared playbook is developing as companies figure out the path to enduring value. We now have shared techniques to make models useful, as well as emerging UI paradigms that will shape generative AI’s second act.</p>



<p><strong>The Model Development Stack</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Emerging reasoning techniques like chain-of-thought, tree-of-thought and reflexion</strong> are improving models’ ability to perform richer, more complex reasoning tasks, closing the gap between customer expectations and model capabilities. Developers are using frameworks like <a href="http://langchain.com/">Langchain</a> to invoke and debug more complex multi-chain sequences.</li>



<li><strong>Transfer learning techniques like RLHF and fine-tuning </strong>are becoming more accessible, especially with the recent availability of fine-tuning for GPT-3.5 and Llama-2, which means that companies can adapt foundation models to their specific domains and improve from user feedback. Developers are downloading open-source models from <a href="http://huggingface.co/">Hugging Face</a> and fine-tuning them to achieve <a href="https://www.anyscale.com/blog/fine-tuning-llms-lora-or-full-parameter-an-in-depth-analysis-with-llama-2">quality</a> performance.</li>



<li><strong>Retrieval-augmented generation</strong> is bringing in context about the business or the user, reducing hallucinations and increasing truthfulness and usefulness. Vector databases from companies like <a href="http://pinecone.io/">Pinecone</a> have become the infrastructure backbone for RAG.</li>



<li><strong>New developer tools and application frameworks </strong>are giving companies reusable building blocks to create more advanced AI applications and helping developers evaluate, improve and monitor the performance of AI models in production, including LLMOps tools like <a href="https://www.langchain.com/langsmith">Langsmith</a> and <a href="http://wandb.ai/">Weights &amp; Biases</a>&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>AI-first infrastructure companies </strong>like <a href="http://corweave.com/">Coreweave</a>, <a href="https://lambdalabs.com/">Lambda Labs</a>, <a href="https://mlfoundry.com/">Foundry</a>, <a href="https://replicate.com/">Replicate</a> and <a href="https://modal.com/">Modal</a> are unbundling the public clouds and providing what AI companies need most: plentiful GPUs at a reasonable cost, available on-demand and highly scalable, with a nice PaaS developer experience.</li>
</ul>



<p>Together, these techniques should close the expectations vs reality gap for models as the underlying foundation models simultaneously improve. But making the models great is only half the battle. The playbook for a generative AI-first user experience is evolving as well:</p>



<p><strong>Emerging Product Blueprints</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Generative interfaces</strong>. A text-based conversational user experience is the default interface on top of an LLM. Gradually, newer form factors are entering the arsenal, from Perplexity’s <a href="https://twitter.com/alexgraveley/status/1659276299091812353">generative user interfaces</a> to new modalities like human-sounding voices from Inflection AI.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>New editing experiences: from Copilot to Director’s Mode</strong>. As we advance from zero-shot to <a href="https://thezbook.com/ask-adjust-the-future-of-productivity-interfaces">ask-and-adjust</a> (h/t Zach Lloyd), generative AI companies are inventing a new set of knobs and switches that look very different from traditional editing workflows. Midjourney’s new panning commands and Runway’s Director’s Mode create new camera-like editing experiences. Eleven Labs is making it possible to manipulate voices through prompting.</li>



<li><strong>Increasingly sophisticated agentic systems. </strong>Generative AI applications are increasingly not just autocomplete or first drafts for human review; they now have the autonomy to problem-solve, access external tools and solve problems end-to-end on our behalf. We are steadily progressing from level 0 to level 5 autonomy.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>System-wide optimization</strong>. Rather than embed in a single human user’s workflow and make that individual more efficient, some companies are directly tackling the system-wide optimization problem. Can you pick off a chunk of support tickets or pull requests and autonomously solve them, thereby making the whole system more effective?</li>
</ul>



<h2>Parting Thoughts</h2>



<p>As we approach the <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/ai-paradox-perspective/">frontier paradox</a> and as the novelty of transformers and diffusion models dies down, the nature of the generative AI market is evolving. Hype and flash are giving way to real value and whole product experiences.</p>



<p>At Sequoia we remain steadfast believers in generative AI. The necessary conditions for this market to take flight have accumulated over the span of decades, and the market is finally here. The emergence of killer applications and the sheer magnitude of end user demand has deepened our conviction in the market.</p>



<p>However, Amara’s Law—the phenomenon that we tend to overestimate the effect of a technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the long run—is running its course. We are applying patience and judgment in our investment decisions, with careful attention to how founders are solving the value problem. The shared playbook companies are using to push the boundaries on model performance and product experiences gives us optimism on generative AI’s second act.</p>

<p>And neither is any other device maker.&nbsp;This industry is full of "feel good" messaging, but generates 50 million metric tons of e-waste each year. We believe the best way to reduce environmental impact is to create products that last longer, meaning fewer new ones need to be made. Instead of operating on feels, we operate on data and actions.&nbsp;With funding from Intel, we commissioned Fraunhofer IZM to do a detailed life cycle analysis (LCA) on Framework Laptop 13 to help us understand where we are today and where we can continue to improve.&nbsp;Check out our thoughts on reducing environmental impact and download the LCA report <a href="https://frame.work/sustainability">here</a>.</p>
<h2>Production update on Framework Laptop 13 (AMD Ryzen 7040 Series)</h2>

<p>We continue to be on track to start shipments before the end of the month on the new Framework Laptop 13 (AMD Ryzen 7040 Series). Last week we shared that SMT (Mainboard production) had started, and this week we’ve begun final assembly of laptops. We also pulled some early units to send out to press reviewers to make sure that you can see exactly where we’ve landed on performance and battery life.&nbsp;We have another happy bit of news to share with you: our Lead System Architect Kieran was able to implement a firmware solution to reduce power consumption when using HDMI and DP Expansion Cards on the back two slots.&nbsp;The only remaining power issue is with USB-A Expansion Cards on the back slots, which we are investigating a future USB-A Expansion Card hardware revision to resolve.</p>

			<p>Half a million years ago, earlier than was previously thought possible, humans were building structures made of wood, according to new research by a team from the University of Liverpool and Aberystwyth University.</p>
<p>The research, published in the journal <em>Nature, </em>reports on the excavation of well-preserved wood at the archaeological site of Kalambo Falls, Zambia, dating back at least 476,000 years and predating the evolution of our own species, <em>Homo sapiens.</em></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://news.liverpool.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/5-the-wooden-structure.png" alt="The excavation team uncovering the wooden wedge" width="399" height="598"></p>
<p>Expert analysis of stone tool cut-marks on the wood show that these early humans shaped and joined two large logs to make a structure, probably the foundation of a platform or part of a dwelling.</p>
<p>This is the earliest evidence from anywhere in the world of the deliberate crafting of logs to fit together. Until now, evidence for the human use of wood was limited to its use for making fire, digging sticks and spears.</p>
<p>Wood is rarely found in such ancient sites as it usually rots and disappears, but at Kalambo Falls permanently high water levels preserved the wood.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://news.liverpool.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2-Larry-1.png" alt="Researchers uncover wooden artefacts on the banks of the Kalambo River in Zambia, near where the oldest-known use of wood in construction was found" width="481" height="342"></p>
<p>This discovery challenges the prevailing view that Stone Age humans were nomadic. At Kalambo Falls these humans not only had a perennial source of water, but the forest around them provided enough food to enable them to settle and make structures.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/archaeology-classics-and-egyptology/staff/lawrence-barham/">Professor Larry Barham</a>, from the University of Liverpool’s <a href="https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/archaeology-classics-and-egyptology/">Department of Archaeology, Classics and Egyptology</a>, who leads the <a href="https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/archaeology-classics-and-egyptology/">‘Deep Roots of Humanity’</a> research project said:</p>
<blockquote><p>This find has changed how I think about our early ancestors. Forget the label ‘Stone Age,’ look at what these people were doing: they made something new, and large, from wood. They used their intelligence, imagination, and skills to create something they’d never seen before, something that had never previously existed.</p>
<p>They transformed their surroundings to make life easier, even if it was only by making a platform to sit on by the river to do their daily chores. These folks were more like us than we thought.</p></blockquote>
<p>The specialist dating of the finds was undertaken by experts at Aberystwyth University.</p>

<p>They used new luminescence dating techniques, which reveal the last time minerals in the sand surrounding the finds were exposed to sunlight, to determine their age.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.aber.ac.uk/en/dges/staff-profiles/listing/profile/ggd/">Professor Geoff Duller</a> from Aberystwyth University said:</p>
<blockquote><p>At this great age, putting a date on finds is very challenging and we used luminescence dating to do this. These new dating methods have far reaching implications – allowing us to date much further back in time, to piece together sites that give us a glimpse into human evolution. The site at Kalambo Falls had been excavated back in the 1960s when similar pieces of wood were recovered, but they were unable to date them, so the true significance of the site was unclear until now.</p></blockquote>
<p>The site of Kalambo Falls on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalambo_River">Kalambo River</a> lies above a 235 metres (772 foot) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall">waterfall</a> on the border of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zambia">Zambia</a> with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rukwa_Region">Rukwa Region</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanzania">Tanzania</a> at the edge of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Tanganyika">Lake Tanganyika</a>. The area is on a ‘tentative‘ list from UNESCO for becoming a World Heritage site because of its archaeological significance.</p>

<p>Professor Duller added:</p>
<p>“Our research proves that this site is much older than previously thought, so its archaeological significance is now even greater. It adds more weight to the argument that it should be a United Nations World Heritage Site.”</p>

<p>This research forms part of the pioneering ‘Deep Roots of Humanity’ project, an investigation into how human technology developed in the Stone Age. The project is funded by the UK’s Arts and Humanities Research Council and involved teams from Zambia’s National Heritage Conservation Commission, Livingstone Museum, Moto Moto Museum and the National Museum, Lusaka.</p>
<p>Professor Barham added:</p>
<p>“Kalambo Falls is an extraordinary site and a major heritage asset for Zambia. The Deep Roots team is looking forward to more exciting discoveries emerging from its waterlogged sands.”</p>

                      <p>Statistics show that men and boys in the United States today disproportionately suffer from a number of serious problems. Since the 1970s, they’ve seen their wages stagnate and are now far less likely than women to attend or graduate from college. Even more seriously, men are much more likely than women to be afflicted by “deaths of despair”: deaths due to suicide or alcohol or drug abuse. These trends are affecting boys and men across racial groups, and especially working-class boys and men.</p>
<p>Richard Reeves, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, is the author of <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/books/of-boys-and-men/"><i>Of Boys and Men: Why the Modern Male Is Struggling, Why It Matters, and What to Do About It</i></a>. For the <a href="https://www.levernews.com/the-american-masculinity-crisis/"><i>Lever Time</i></a><i> </i>podcast, <i>Jacobin </i>editor at large David Sirota interviewed Reeves about the crisis afflicting men, how right-wing politicians have weaponized it to promote a reactionary agenda, and how the Left might come up with a better response to men’s problems. This transcript has been edited for length and clarity.</p>

                      David Sirota
                </span></p><p>What are some of the most telling signals that the modern male is struggling — and specifically as a group, as distinct from the struggles of the population writ large?</p>

              </div>
            <div>
                <p><span>
                  
                    
                      Richard Reeves
                </span></p><p>Let’s start with the economy and the labor market, where the well-told story about wage stagnation is particularly acute for men. Most American men earned less in 2019 than most American men did in 1979.</p>
<p>Of course, it’s also true that wages didn’t grow that quickly for working-class women by comparison to other women. But women’s wages did grow across the board — just faster at the top than at the bottom — whereas for men you saw wage stagnation.</p>
<p>What that means is that the only reason that middle-class American households saw any rise in their household incomes at all over that period was because of women. It was women’s work, women’s wages. So there’s all kinds of downstream consequences.</p>
<p>Then if we turn to something like education, what we see is a massive overtaking by girls and women of men, such that there’s now a bigger gender gap in education today than there was in 1972. On college campuses, for example, women are further ahead of men now than men were ahead of women when we passed Title IX in 1972.</p>
<p>Some of the consequences for that are difficulties around family formation and deaths of despair. There’s been lots of discussion of deaths of despair — which are from suicide, alcohol, or drugs — but maybe a little less attention to the fact that men are at least three times higher risk of one of those deaths of despair than women are. Deaths of despair are largely a male — and largely a working-class male — problem.</p>

              </div>
          
            <div>
                <p><span>
                  
                    
                      David Sirota
                </span></p><p>There has been a gender wage gap for a very long time. Are you saying that what we’ve seen is that the gap has somewhat narrowed not just because women’s wages are going up, but also because men’s wages have stagnated or actually dropped? There’s an alternate history where everything is improving for both men and women, but it improves more quickly for women to deal with historic disparities. But you’re saying that’s not happening: it’s a negative story for men.</p>

              </div>
            <div>
                <p><span>
                  
                    
                      Richard Reeves
                </span></p><p>In terms of earnings, yes. The gender pay gap is typically measured at the median. So when people hear that women earn eighty-two or eighty-three cents on the dollar versus men, what’s being referred to there is median pay. One reason why the gender pay gap has narrowed over the last few decades is that women’s wages have risen quite sharply at the median — 30-something percent or more — but part of it is because male wages have dropped at the median.</p>
<p>That’s not the main reason for the narrowing, but it’s one of the reasons, and I don’t think it’s controversial to suggest that that’s bad news. If we’d seen similar levels of women’s wage growth at the median, and we hadn’t seen wage stagnation for men, it’s not clear to me that that would have been a worse world. I don’t think many people want to close the gender wage gap by crashing male wages.</p>

<p>At the top of the distribution, men and women have seen rising wages. Up toward that eightieth or ninetieth percentile, women have seen faster wage growth, but both men and women have seen it.</p>
<p>My overall understanding of these labor market trends over the last few decades is that we’ve seen a narrowing of the gender wage gap, for the reasons we just discussed, and a sharp widening of the class wage gap. They’re pulling in different directions. So the gap between the median and the top has gotten much wider, but the gap between men and women at each level has gotten narrower.</p>

              </div>
          
            <div>
                <p><span>
                  
                    
                      David Sirota
                </span></p><p>I want to ask about the maleness part of this, in looking at wages, jobs, education levels, health care, deaths of despair, and so on. How much of this is related to maleness, however we define that, rather than other factors like economic inequality, geography, or education? How do we narrow in on this as a problem of maleness specifically?</p>

              </div>
            <div>
                <p><span>
                  
                    
                      Richard Reeves
                </span></p><p>There is enough evidence that some of these problems do break quite strongly along male-female lines, so as to justify the attention on men in particular. The male suicide rate is four times higher than the female suicide rate. It has risen by 25 percent in the last decade and rose very sharply between 2020 and 2021, 8 percent for young men alone. And there wasn’t an increase for women.</p>
<p>That isn’t to say that female suicide isn’t a problem; of course it is. Sometimes, when I’m drawing attention to the gaps in education, people will say, no one cared when it was the other way around, when women were that far behind men. To that, my answer is: yeah, people did care. And we did a whole bunch of stuff about it, and quite rightly too. We passed laws; we had significant campaigns to try and overcome it.</p>
<p>To some extent, it becomes an empirical question as to whether there’s enough of a gender gap here on whatever the issue is to say, we should look at that. I would say the same is true the other way around. For example, the gender pay gap we’ve just talked about — just because 40 percent of women earn more than the average man now doesn’t mean there isn’t still an issue about gender pay gaps.</p>
<p>I’d look at the data on it and say, is there a strong enough pattern here to make you think this is worth looking at through that lens? There’ll be a whole bunch of issues where you’re like, “There isn’t much to see here in terms of gender.”</p>
<p>But there are other issues where there clearly is, in one direction or the other, and then I think we should be gender sensitive. We should also look at how that intersects by class, by race, and so on. So we might talk about the gender pay gap, but we shouldn’t forget the fact that white women now earn a lot more than black men.</p>
<p>That wasn’t true in 1979. So white women have seen very strong increases in their wages, such that for every dollar earned by a white woman, a black man earns about eighty-four cents, which is similar to the gender gap.</p>
<p>The point of that is not to say that the gender gap isn’t important and real. It is just to say that it’s very important that we don’t look at these things just through one lens, but try to look at them through different lenses.</p>

              </div>
          
            <div>
                <p><span>
                  
                    
                      David Sirota
                </span></p><p>What is fueling this dynamic? Is it mostly the economic issues that you mentioned? Does it have to do with the changing nature of our culture? Is it something in our politics?</p>

              </div>
            <div>
                <p><span>
                  
                    
                      Richard Reeves
                </span></p><p>I put it under three headings. Number one is, almost independently of everything else, the education system isn’t doing very well by lots of our boys and men now. We have a ten percentage point drop in the share of male teachers, incredible underinvestment in apprenticeships and vocational forms of learning, and all kinds of changes in school environments that mean that we’re not serving them very well.</p>
<p>That’s not to suggest that there aren’t plenty of girls who aren’t being served well too. But overall, young men hit the labor market or college or whatever less well-prepared as a result of the education system. The single biggest risk factor for dropping out of college, controlling for everything else, is being male. They struggle throughout education; they might struggle to land in the labor market.</p>
<p>The second bucket is that the labor market has been transformed in the last forty or fifty years in such a way as to make it much more difficult for men with modest levels of education to do OK.</p>

<p>We can have a very long discussion as to why that is: globalization, deunionization, loss of all kinds of jobs, and so on. It’s not because women came into the labor market; it’s because of these other external shocks to the labor market.</p>
<p>Then bucket number three is the most contentious one, in a way. The fact that women have seen such a massive increase in their economic independence means that the basis upon which men and women form families and relationships has been significantly transformed. In the space of not much more than a generation, the presumption of the male breadwinner has largely unraveled. In my view, that’s a great thing.</p>
<p>However, I think that has left a lot of men struggling to catch up with a culture where their role as a breadwinner has been undermined by economic brute facts, and then has been undermined by changes in their relationships to women, and they’ve come into it ill-served as well. So you have underskilled men facing a labor market that’s become a bit more hostile than the one their dads faced, and women who are saying, “Well, I might not need you.” I think all of those feed off each other.</p>

              </div>
          
            <div>
                <p><span>
                  
                    
                      David Sirota
                </span></p><p>In the past several years, we’ve seen right-wing politicians like Josh Hawley and Ted Cruz talk about the so-called attack on masculinity. We’ve seen YouTubers whose entire business model seems to be repackaging and selling one version of masculinity. We’ve seen gun marketing trying to fuse masculinity with the idea of buying weapons, owning weapons, shooting weapons.</p>
<p>Why do you think these messages have become so effective? What do you think would be a more constructive counternarrative to those kinds of messages?</p>

              </div>
            <div>
                <p><span>
                  
                    
                      Richard Reeves
                </span></p><p>I think they’re effective because, first, they identify some real problems. Hawley’s a great example of this. If you read some passages of Hawley’s book or [listen to him speak], I’m like, yeah, that’s the same data that I’ve got. Yes, I’m with you so far, senator.</p>
<p>But then what he does is he says, these men are struggling, and you know why? And he doesn’t say because of what’s happened to the economy, or because of what’s happening elsewhere. He says, “Because of the Left. Because the Left is obsessed with toxic masculinity, and birthing people, and so on. The Left hates masculinity. The Left hates men. The Left would rather have a world where we got rid of men.”</p>
<p>It’s a straw woman that he creates. He says, “It’s feminism’s fault,” and “If you’re feeling pissed off, if you’re struggling as a man, I hear you, it’s their fault, vote for me. Do I have any policy prescriptions? No, because I’m a culture warrior and so I don’t need to actually be able to do anything about it.” But what he and what others do is successfully wrap together these real anxieties that a lot of men fee or that women feel on behalf of the men in their lives.</p>
<p>He says that’s also about the Second Amendment, and that’s also about Americanism; that’s also about religion. It gets wrapped up into this sense of being a real Christian American white man. Masculinity, Hawley says, is the tip of the spear of the Left’s attack against America.</p>

<p>I don’t think that’s even plausibly true. But I know why he’s doing that — because it’s visceral. You can attach a bunch of other things to that visceral sense of your identity as a man being under attack.</p>
<p>That doesn’t only work with Christian white men, although I’ve just mentioned them. I was very struck by a poll that found that half of American men now agree that “today, men are sometimes criticized just for acting like men” — that’s the quote in the survey — and black men are more likely to say that’s true.</p>
<p>A more positive response would be to say, we get it, here are a bunch of problems. For example, would it be a terrible idea to have an office of men’s health focused on issues around suicide and male mental health? Would it be a good idea if the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] recognized the suicide gap facing men and had some work around that?</p>
<p>Would it be a terrible idea to have a recruitment drive for male teachers? We have a massive recruitment drive for women into STEM and, most recently, women into construction. I’m here for that. But what about the fact that we have emptied out, not only education, but social work and psychology of men?</p>
<p>You have an infrastructure bill that will create jobs largely for men. Two-thirds of the jobs in the infrastructure bill will go to men: black men as much as white men, and Hispanic men a little bit more, because they’re so represented in the construction industry. Don’t hide from that fact, as the administration does when they’re challenged on it.</p>
<p>Own it. Make it a feature, not a bug. And say, “Here are all the things we’re doing on behalf of women.” There’s lots more to do for women. But the fact that this bill is the first piece of legislation for a long time that will specifically help working-class men of all races and ethnicities — I’m proud of that as a Democrat, because working-class men have had it pretty rough for the last few years.</p>
<p>Why not say that? Simple things like that, I believe, would take the wind out of the sails of the attack from the Right. The silence on these issues from the Left creates this huge political opening for the Right. And they’re seizing it.</p>

<p>My spicy take is that XML is better than YAML, because there are situations where XML is appropriate, but there’s no situation where YAML is appropriate.</p>
<p><strong>Johnny Boursiquot:</strong> <em>Dang. Shots fired! 🤣</em></p>
<h2>Let’s talk about XML first</h2>
<p>So, XML got a really bad reputation. The reason it got a really bad reputation is because people were using it for things that it should never have been used for. XML stands for <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xml/">Extensible Markup Language</a>. And if you’re using it as an <em>extensible markup language</em>, it’s actually really great.</p>
<p>Let’s say you’re working on something and you’re like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I’m making a new kind of book, and I need to annotate all of the verses in the Bible, and have the chapter headings and stuff.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s great for that.</p>
<p>It’s really good for when you have a document, and some things are italicized, and some things are in a foreign language, and subtitles, and all that stuff. It’s really good for that. It’s not good if it’s like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I need to configure this server and the server needs to know if this value is true or false.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, that’s bad. Don’t do that. That’s not a good use for XML.</p>
<p>But XML does have some uses for which it’s appropriate. And I think the fact that now everybody is writing React… and they’re writing it with JSX… and JSX is basically just inline XML… I think that shows that there are cases where actually XML is pretty good.</p>
<h2>YAML on the other hand</h2>
<p>YAML on the other hand I think is never good. There’s always something better than YAML!</p>
<p>We’ve finally made it to Go 1.21 and I’m very happy about this. And you know why? Because YAML repeatedly <em>bit me in the behind</em> on Go 1.20. Ask me why.</p>
<p><strong>Johnny Boursiquot:</strong> <em>Why?</em></p>
<p>Well, when you say in your test file:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“test this against Go 1.20”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It interprets that as Go 1.2. 😭🤣</p>
<p>So it was like two or three different times I had a repo where I’m like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“These tests aren’t passing. Why are my tests not passing?! I’ve just upgraded to Go 1.20.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And it was like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Oh, no. I’ve decided that this is Go 1.2”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And so YAML is always going to do that to you…</p>
<h3>Better choices</h3>
<p>Now, I understand why people do YAML, but there are better choices. You can use <a href="https://toml.io/en/">TOML</a>. You can use <a href="https://cuelang.org/">CUE</a>. You can use lots of things.</p>
<p>I like how <a href="https://caddyserver.com/">Caddy</a> does it. With Caddy, the canonical language that Caddy understands is JSON, but they have adapters.</p>
<p>So if you want to write YAML, you can. But it’ll just take that YAML and turn it into JSON behind the scenes.  Then they also have a specific Caddy language. So you can give it the Caddy language and then it turns that into JSON behind the scenes. And you can give it an NGINX config and it’ll turn that into JSON behind the scenes. If you have the cycles and time to spare, that’s probably the best solution for most people…</p>
<p>But when the only way to do it is YAML, it’s like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“No…!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s just too error-prone, there’s too many things… You just have to always quote everything.</p>
<h3>Also…</h3>
<p>Also the YAML specification has all these features that nobody ever uses, because they’re really confusing, and hard, and you can include documents inside of other documents, with references and stuff… And it’s like</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Oh, man, I don’t want to have to understand any of this stuff.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then if you’re not careful, it’d be like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Oh yeah, the first three things I fed it to understood that, but then the third one was just like using some parser that they found on the back of a truck, and it doesn’t understand it”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and it’s like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Oh, man…”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>YAML… never appropriate. XML is sometimes appropriate.</p>

<p><strong>LOS ALTOS, Calif. and CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (Sept. 19, 2023)<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>– Today, Toyota Research Institute (TRI) announced a breakthrough generative AI approach based on Diffusion Policy to quickly and confidently teach robots new, dexterous skills. This advancement significantly improves robot utility and is a step towards building “Large Behavior Models (LBMs)” for robots, analogous to the Large Language Models (LLMs) that have recently revolutionized conversational AI.</p>

<p>“Our research in robotics is aimed at amplifying people rather than replacing them,” said<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.tri.global/about-us/dr-gill-pratt" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Gill Pratt</a>, CEO of TRI and Chief Scientist for Toyota Motor Corporation. “This new teaching technique is both very efficient and produces very high performing behaviors, enabling robots to much more effectively amplify people in many ways.”</p>

<p>Previous state-of-the-art techniques to teach robots new behaviors were slow, inconsistent, inefficient, and often limited to narrowly defined tasks performed in highly constrained environments. Roboticists needed to spend many hours writing sophisticated code and/or using numerous trial and error cycles to program behaviors.</p>

<p>TRI has already taught robots more than 60 difficult, dexterous skills using the new approach, including pouring liquids, using tools, and manipulating deformable objects. These achievements were realized without writing a single line of new code; the only change was supplying the robot with new data. Building on this success, TRI has set an ambitious target of teaching hundreds of new skills by the end of the year and 1,000 by the end of 2024.</p>

<p>Today’s news also highlights that robots can be taught to function in new scenarios and perform a wide range of behaviors. These skills are not limited to just “‘pick and place” or simply picking up objects and putting them down in new locations. TRI’s robots can now interact with the world in varied and rich ways — which will one day allow robots to support people in everyday situations and unpredictable, ever-changing environments.</p>

</p>




<p>“The tasks that I’m watching these robots perform are simply amazing – even one year ago, I would not have predicted that we were close to this level of diverse dexterity,” remarked<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.tri.global/about-us/dr-russ-tedrake" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Russ Tedrake</a>, Vice President of Robotics Research at TRI. Dr. Tedrake, who is also the Toyota Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Aeronautics and Astronautics, and Mechanical Engineering at MIT, explained, “What is so exciting about this new approach is the rate and reliability with which we can add new skills. Because these skills work directly from camera images and tactile sensing, using only learned representations, they are able to perform well even on tasks that involve deformable objects, cloth, and liquids — all of which have traditionally been extremely difficult for robots.”</p>

<p><strong>Technical details:</strong></p>

<p>TRI’s robot behavior model learns from haptic demonstrations from a teacher, combined with a language description of the goal. It then uses an AI-based Diffusion Policy to learn the demonstrated skill. This process allows a new behavior to be deployed autonomously from dozens of demonstrations. Not only does this approach produce consistent, repeatable, and performant results, but it does so with tremendous speed.</p>

<p>Key achievements of TRI’s research for this novel development include:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Diffusion Policy:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>TRI and our collaborators in<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://shurans.github.io/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Professor Song</a>’s group at Columbia University developed a new, powerful generative-AI approach to behavior learning. This approach, called<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04137" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Diffusion Policy</a>, enables easy and rapid behavior teaching from demonstration.</li>
	<li><strong>Customized Robot Platform:<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>TRI’s robot platform is custom-built for dexterous dual-arm manipulation tasks with a special focus on enabling haptic feedback and tactile sensing.</li>
	<li><strong>Pipeline</strong>: TRI robots have learned 60 dexterous skills already, with a target of hundreds by the end of the year and 1,000 by the end of 2024.</li>
	<li><strong>Drake:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Part of our (not so) secret sauce is<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://drake.mit.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Drake</a>, a model-based design for robotics that provides us with a cutting-edge toolbox and simulation platform. Drake’s high degree of realism allows us to develop in both simulation and in reality at a dramatically increased scale and velocity than would otherwise be possible. Our internal robot stack is built using Drake’s optimization and systems frameworks, and we have made Drake open source to catalyze work across the entire robotics community.</li>
	<li><strong>Safety:<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>Safety is core to our robotics efforts at TRI. We have designed our system with strong safeguards, powered by Drake and our custom robot control stack, to ensure our robots respect safety guarantees like not colliding with itself or its environment.</li>
