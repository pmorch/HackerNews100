Last year, Willow proved its power with our Random Circuit Sampling benchmark, a test designed to measure maximum quantum state complexity. The Quantum Echoes algorithm represents a new class of challenge because it models a physical experiment. This means this algorithm tests not only for complexity, but also for precision in the final calculation. This is why we call it “quantum verifiable,” meaning the result can be cross-benchmarked and verified by another quantum computer of similar quality. To deliver both precision and complexity, the hardware must have two key traits: extremely low error rates and high-speed operations.</p>

One of the tools scientists use to understand chemical structure is Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), the same science behind MRI technology. NMR acts as a molecular microscope, powerful enough to let us see the relative position of atoms, which helps us understand a molecule’s structure. Modeling molecules’ shape and dynamics is foundational in chemistry, biology and materials science, and advances that help us do this better underpin progress in fields ranging from biotechnology to solar energy to nuclear fusion.</p><p data-block-key="7svu9">In a <a href="https://quantum.devsite.corp.google.com/site-assets/downloads/quantum-computation-molecular-geometry-via-nuclear-spin-echoes.pdf">proof-of-principle experiment</a> in partnership with The University of California, Berkeley, we ran the Quantum Echoes algorithm on our Willow chip to study two molecules, one with 15 atoms and another with 28 atoms, to verify this approach. The results on our quantum computer matched those of traditional NMR, and revealed information not usually available from NMR, which is a crucial validation of our approach.</p><p data-block-key="57iba">Just as the telescope and the microscope opened up new, unseen worlds, this experiment is a step toward a ‘quantum-scope’ capable of measuring previously unobservable natural phenomena. Quantum computing-enhanced NMR could become a powerful tool in drug discovery, helping determine how potential medicines bind to their targets, or in materials science for characterizing the molecular structure of new materials like polymers, battery components or even the materials that comprise our quantum bits (qubits).</p></div>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/2025/new-ebu-research-ai-assistants-news-content">https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/2025/new-ebu-research-ai-assistants-news-content</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45668990">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-testid="textComponent"><p>New research coordinated by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and led by the BBC has found that AI assistants – already a daily information gateway for millions of people – routinely misrepresent news content no matter which language, territory, or AI platform is tested.</p>
<p>The intensive international study of unprecedented scope and scale was launched at the EBU News Assembly, in Naples. Involving 22 public service media (PSM) organizations in 18 countries working in 14 languages, it identified multiple systemic issues across four leading AI tools.</p>
<ul>
<li>Read the <strong><a title="Opens a PDF in a new window." href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/aboutthebbc/documents/news-integrity-in-ai-assistants-report.pdf%20" target="_blank">News Integrity in AI Assistants Report</a></strong></li>
<li>Read the&nbsp;<strong><a title="Opens a PDF in a new window." href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/aboutthebbc/documents/news-integrity-in-ai-assistants-toolkit.pdf%20" target="_blank">News Integrity in AI Assistants Toolkit</a></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Professional journalists from participating PSM evaluated more than 3,000 responses from ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini, and Perplexity against key criteria, including accuracy, sourcing, distinguishing opinion from fact, and providing context.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Key findings:&nbsp;<br> </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>45% of all AI answers had at least one significant issue.</li>
<li>31% of responses showed serious sourcing problems – missing, misleading, or incorrect attributions.</li>
<li>20% contained major accuracy issues, including hallucinated details and outdated information.</li>
<li>Gemini performed worst with significant issues in 76% of responses, more than double the other assistants, largely due to its poor sourcing performance.</li>
<li>Comparison between the BBC’s results earlier this year and this study show some improvements but still high levels of errors.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why this distortion matters</strong></p>
<p>AI assistants are already replacing search engines for many users. According to the Reuters Institute’s Digital News Report 2025, 7% of total online news consumers use AI assistants to get their news, rising to 15% of under-25s.</p>
<p>‘This research conclusively shows that these failings are not isolated incidents,’ says EBU Media Director and Deputy Director General Jean Philip De Tender. ‘They are systemic, cross-border, and multilingual, and we believe this endangers public trust. When people don’t know what to trust, they end up trusting nothing at all, and that can deter democratic participation.’</p>
<p>Peter Archer, BBC Programme Director, Generative AI, says: ‘We’re excited about AI and how it can help us bring even more value to audiences. But people must be able to trust what they read, watch and see. Despite some improvements, it’s clear that there are still significant issues with these assistants. We want these tools to succeed and are open to working with AI companies to deliver for audiences and wider society.’</p>
<p><strong>Next steps</strong></p>
<p>The research team have also released a <a title="Opens a PDF in a new window." href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/aboutthebbc/documents/news-integrity-in-ai-assistants-toolkit.pdf%20" target="_blank">News Integrity in AI Assistants Toolkit</a>, to help develop solutions to the issues uncovered in the report. It includes improving AI assistant responses and media literacy among users. Building on the extensive insights and examples identified in the current research, the Toolkit addresses two main questions: “What makes a good AI assistant response to a news question?” and “What are the problems that need to be fixed?”.</p>
<p>In addition, the EBU and its Members are pressing EU and national regulators to enforce existing laws on information integrity, digital services, and media pluralism. And they stress that ongoing independent monitoring of AI assistants is essential, given the fast pace of AI development, and are seeking options for continuing the research on a rolling basis.</p>
<p><strong>About the project</strong></p>
<p>This study built on research by the BBC published in February 2025, which first highlighted AI’s problems in handling news. This second round expanded the scope internationally, confirming that the issue is systemic and is not tied to language, market or AI assistant.</p>
<p><strong>Participating broadcasters:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Belgium (RTBF, VRT)</li>
<li>Canada (CBC-Radio Canada)</li>
<li>Czechia (Czech Radio)</li>
<li>Finland (YLE)</li>
<li>France (Radio France)</li>
<li>Georgia (GPB)</li>
<li>Germany (ARD, ZDF, Deutsche Welle)</li>
<li>Italy (Rai)</li>
<li>Lithuania (LRT)</li>
<li>Netherlands (NOS/NPO)</li>
<li>Norway (NRK)</li>
<li>Portugal (RTP)</li>
<li>Spain (RTVE)</li>
<li>Sweden (SVT)</li>
<li>Switzerland (SRF)</li>
<li>Ukraine (Suspilne)</li>
<li>United Kingdom (BBC)</li>
<li>USA (NPR)</li>
</ul>
<p>Separately, the BBC has today published research into audience use and perceptions of AI assistants for News. This shows that many people trust AI assistants to be accurate - with just over a third of UK adults saying that they trust AI to produce accurate summaries, rising to almost half for people under-35.</p>
<p>The findings raise major concerns. Many people assume AI summaries of news content are accurate, when they are not; and when they see errors, they blame news providers as well as AI developers – even if those mistakes are a product of the AI assistant. Ultimately, these errors could negatively impact people’s trust in news and news brands.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>The relationship between computing systems and the brain has served as motivation for pioneering theoreticians since John von Neumann and Alan Turing. Uniform, scale-free biological networks, such as the brain, have powerful properties, including generalizing over time, which is the main barrier for Machine Learning on the path to Universal Reasoning Models.
<br>We introduce `Dragon Hatchling' (BDH), a new Large Language Model architecture based on a scale-free biologically inspired network of \$n\$ locally-interacting neuron particles. BDH couples strong theoretical foundations and inherent interpretability without sacrificing Transformer-like performance.
<br>BDH is a practical, performant state-of-the-art attention-based state space sequence learning architecture. In addition to being a graph model, BDH admits a GPU-friendly formulation. It exhibits Transformer-like scaling laws: empirically BDH rivals GPT2 performance on language and translation tasks, at the same number of parameters (10M to 1B), for the same training data.
<br>BDH can be represented as a brain model. The working memory of BDH during inference entirely relies on synaptic plasticity with Hebbian learning using spiking neurons. We confirm empirically that specific, individual synapses strengthen connection whenever BDH hears or reasons about a specific concept while processing language inputs. The neuron interaction network of BDH is a graph of high modularity with heavy-tailed degree distribution. The BDH model is biologically plausible, explaining one possible mechanism which human neurons could use to achieve speech.
<br>BDH is designed for interpretability. Activation vectors of BDH are sparse and positive. We demonstrate monosemanticity in BDH on language tasks. Interpretability of state, which goes beyond interpretability of neurons and model parameters, is an inherent feature of the BDH architecture.

<p>Click. Ugh. Another one.</p>
<p>You know the drill. You land on a new website, eager to read an article or check a product price, and before the page even finishes loading, it appears: the dreaded cookie banner. A pop-up, a slide-in, a full-screen overlay demanding you "Accept All," "Manage Preferences," or navigate a labyrinth of toggles designed by a corporate lawyer.</p>
<p>Most people do the same thing: they sigh, their eyes glaze over, and they click "Accept All" with the muscle memory of a weary soldier.</p>
<p>This daily ritual of digital whack-a-mole is the result of well-intentioned privacy laws like GDPR and CCPA. The goal was noble: to give users control over their data. But the execution? It's a colossal failure. It has created a web experience that is more annoying, less transparent, and arguably no more private.</p>
<p>The problem isn't the <em>what</em>. It's the <em>where</em>. The law placed the burden of consent on millions of individual websites, when it should have targeted the one tool we all use to access them: <strong>the browser.</strong></p>
<h2>The Insanity of the Status Quo</h2>
<p>Imagine if every time you got into your car, you had to manually approve the engine's use of oil, the tires' use of air, and the radio's use of electricity. It’s absurd, right? You’d set your preferences once, and the car would just work.</p>
<p>Yet, that’s exactly what we do online. We are asked the same questions, by every single website, every single day. This approach is broken for three simple reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Consent Fatigue is Real:</strong> We're so bombarded with these requests that they’ve become meaningless. The banners are an obstacle to be cleared, not a choice to be considered. True consent requires a conscious, informed decision, not an exasperated click to get the pop-up out of the way.</li>
<li><strong>It Punishes the Little Guys:</strong> A giant corporation can afford a team of lawyers and expensive Consent Management Platforms (CMPs) to create a compliant (and often deliberately confusing) banner. But what about the small blogger, the local restaurant, or the indie developer? For them, it's another technical and legal headache, forcing them to install clunky, site-slowing plugins just to avoid a potential lawsuit.</li>
<li><strong>It Doesn't Actually Give Us Control:</strong> The illusion of choice is not choice. When the options are "Accept All" or "Spend Five Minutes in a Menu of Legalese," the system is designed to push you toward the path of least resistance.</li>
</ol>
<h2>A Simple, Radical Idea: Put Consent in the Browser</h2>
<p>Now, imagine a different internet.</p>
<p>When you set up your browser—be it Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge—you go through a simple, one-time setup. It asks for your privacy preferences in plain English:</p>
<p><strong>How do you want to handle your data?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Essential Only:</strong> "Only allow data necessary for websites to function (e.g., keeping me logged in, remembering my shopping cart)."</li>
<li><strong>Performance &amp; Analytics:</strong> "Help creators improve their sites by letting them see anonymous data about how I use them."</li>
<li><strong>Personalized Experience:</strong> "Allow sites to use my data for personalized content and relevant advertising."</li>
<li><strong>Custom:</strong> Fine-tune your settings for specific data types.</li>
</ul>
<p>You make your choice once. <em>Set it and forget it.</em></p>
<p>From that moment on, the responsibility shifts. Your browser becomes your personal privacy enforcer, and the law would require it to act on your behalf. Based on your one-time choice, it would be responsible for allowing or declining cookies from every site you visit. If a website tries to use a cookie with an unclear or undeclared purpose? The browser simply blocks it—no questions asked.</p>
<p>It's much more realistic and effective to make a handful of browsers follow the law than it is to force millions of websites to do the same thing. This isn't just a theory—it's the exact lesson we learned from the failure of the "Do Not Track" signal. DNT relied on websites to voluntarily honor a user's choice, and most simply didn't. Even if it were legally binding, you can't possibly police millions of websites to ensure they comply. By contrast, you can easily check that a few major browsers are actively enforcing the settings you choose. Browser-side enforcement solves the problem by turning a polite request into an unbreakable rule.</p>
<h2>The World We Could Have</h2>
<p>This browser-centric model would fix everything that’s wrong with the current system:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>For Users: Real Control &amp; A Cleaner Web.</strong> Your choice would be meaningful because you’d make it once, thoughtfully. The result? A faster, cleaner, and radically less annoying internet experience. You could easily review or change your global settings at any time, right in your browser.</li>
<li><strong>For Website Owners: A Massive Burden Lifted.</strong> Suddenly, millions of developers, creators, and small business owners are freed from the role of digital janitor. They no longer need to install ugly, performance-killing scripts. Compliance becomes automatic. The web becomes more accessible and innovative.</li>
<li><strong>For Regulators: Easier Enforcement.</strong> Instead of trying to police millions of websites, regulators could focus on a handful of major browser developers. Are they implementing the standard correctly? Are they honoring the user's choice? It’s a much more efficient and effective system.</li>
</ul>
<h2>From a Tangled Mess to a Simple Tool</h2>
<p>Some might call this a radical change, but the truly radical thing is the convoluted system we've accepted as normal.</p>
<p>Right now, the internet runs on a fragile, sprawling patchwork of compliance tools. Think about the sheer absurdity of it. Every individual website owner is forced to bolt on a third-party Consent Management Platform (CMP). That platform must then be perfectly configured to talk to dozens of different ad-tech vendors, analytics scripts, and embedded services. All of this has to work flawlessly while navigating the subtle legal differences between GDPR, CCPA, and a growing list of other regulations.</p>
<p>It’s an ecosystem where countless platforms are all trying to talk to each other, duplicating effort and overcomplicating the simple act of a user saying "yes" or "no." We've built a million different, shaky bridges to solve a problem that requires only one.</p>
<p>A browser-based approach cuts through this entire tangled web.</p>
<p>It replaces millions of individual, often-conflicting systems with <strong>one, single source of truth</strong>: your browser.</p>
<p>This isn’t about building a new, complex system. It’s about <strong>dismantling a monstrously inefficient one.</strong></p>
<p>It’s about freeing developers and small businesses from being amateur privacy lawyers. It’s about creating a standard that is clear for users, simple for creators, and effective for regulators.</p>
<p>It's time to take the consent dialog out of the websites we visit and put it where it always belonged: in our hands, via our browsers.</p><!-- CONTENT END 2 -->

					The NVIDIA Inception startup projects that space-based data centers will offer 10x lower energy costs and reduce the need for energy consumption on Earth.				</p>
			
			
		</div>

	
	
		<div>
<div><p>Extraterrestrial data centers are just on the horizon. Soon, an AI-equipped satellite from Starcloud, a member of the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/startups/?nvid=nv-int-tblg-295718-vt33">NVIDIA Inception</a> program for startups, will orbit the Earth.</p>
<p>It’s a large step toward the startup’s ultimate goal to bring state-of-the-art data centers to outer space. This can be a part of the solution to address challenges faced by rising AI demands, including energy consumption and cooling requirements for data centers on Earth.</p>
</div>

	</p>
</div>

<div><p>“In space, you get almost unlimited, low-cost renewable energy,” said Philip Johnston, cofounder and CEO of the startup, which is based in Redmond, Washington. “The only cost on the environment will be on the launch, then there will be 10x carbon-dioxide savings over the life of the data center compared with powering the data center terrestrially on Earth.”</p>
<p>Starcloud’s upcoming satellite launch, planned for November, will mark the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/h100/">NVIDIA H100 GPU’s</a> cosmic debut — and the first time a state-of-the-art, data center-class GPU is in outer space.</p>
<p>The 60-kilogram Starcloud-1 satellite, about the size of a small fridge, is expected to offer 100x more powerful GPU compute than any previous space-based operation.</p>

<div>
	<h2>How Data Centers in Space Can Increase Sustainability</h2><div><p>Instead of relying on fresh water for cooling through evaporation towers, as many Earth-based data centers do, Starcloud’s space-based data centers can use the vacuum of deep space as an infinite heat sink.</p>
<p>Emitting waste heat from infrared radiation into space can conserve significant water resources on Earth, since water isn’t needed for cooling. Constant exposure to the sun in orbit also means nearly infinite solar power — aka no need for the data centers to rely on batteries or backup power.</p>

	<p>Starcloud projects the energy costs in space to be 10x cheaper than land-based options, even including launch expenses. “In 10 years, nearly all new data centers will be being built in outer space,” Johnston predicts.</p></div>

<div>
	<h2>Applications for Space-Based Data Centers</h2><div><p>An early use case for extraterrestrial data centers is the analysis of Earth observation data, which could inform applications for detecting crop types and predicting local weather.</p>
<p>Plus, real-time data processing in space offers immense benefits for critical applications such as wildfire detection and distress-signal response. Running <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/ai-inference/">inference</a> in space, right where the data’s collected, allows insights to be delivered nearly instantaneously, reducing response times from hours to minutes.</p>

	</p>
</div>

<div><p>Earth observation methods include optical imaging with cameras, hyperspectral imaging using light wavelengths beyond human vision and synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) imaging to build high-resolution, 3D maps of Earth.</p>
<p>SAR, in particular, generates lots of data — about 10 gigabytes per second, according to Johnston — so in-space inference would be especially beneficial when creating these maps.</p>
<p>“Starcloud needs to be competitive with the type of workload you can run on an Earth-based data center, and NVIDIA GPUs are the most performant in terms of training, fine-tuning and inference,” Johnston said, explaining why the company chose to use NVIDIA accelerated computing on its upcoming satellite launch.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="mw-content-text" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>I'm very sad to announce that Dr. Gregory B. Newby (gbnewby) has died after a short battle with cancer. Dr. Newby was CEO of the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation for more than 20 years and, in that role, worked very closely with Distributed Proofreaders. He was also a voting member of the Distributed Proofreader Foundation board.
</p><p>Born in Canada, Dr. Newby grew up in the US. He returned to Canada, however, to work for the government in the Yukon Territory as he continued his direction of Project Gutenberg.
</p><p>In a recent interview, Greg described how he, a life-long reader, became excited about the possibilities of ebooks back in 1987 when someone emailed him a copy of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland -- "I immediately realized what a tremendous thing that was." He cared deeply about Project Gutenberg's mission. "You know," he told the podcast interviewer, "That keeps me going ... having a positive impact and getting all that literature into people's hands."
</p><p>In 2023, Dr. Newby collaborated with Microsoft and MIT to produce the Project Gutenberg Open Audiobook Collection of AI-narrated audiobooks. This initiative was named one of "The Best Inventions of 2023" by TIME magazine.
</p><p>Greg's vision saw the ebooks (many of them produced here at Distributed Proofreaders) made available through Project Gutenberg grow to more than 75,000.
</p><p>Dr. Newby and his tireless leadership of Project Gutenberg was a close partner of Distributed Proofreaders and will be greatly missed here.
</p><p>The official announcement is <a href="https://www.pgdp.net/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?t=84636" title="forumtopic:84636">here</a>.

<p>In today’s world, internet access is essential for education, health, and safety. </p>



<p>Yet, many people in East and North Greenland still struggle with slow or unreliable connections. That is about to change.</p>



<h2>Faster and More Stable</h2>

<p>Greenland’s national telecom company, Tusass, has signed a new agreement with the French company Eutelsat<strong> </strong>to provide satellite internet through OneWeb, reports Danish News Media <a href="https://www.dr.dk/nyheder/indland/groenland/groenland-satser-paa-fransk-selskab-frem-elon-musk-s-satellitter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DR</a>.</p>



<p>These satellites will bring faster and more stable coverage to towns and settlements that do not have underwater cables or radio links.</p>



<h2>Closing the Gap</h2>

<p>Tusass director Toke Binzer said the new service will improve life in remote areas such as Tasiilaq, Ittoqqortoormiit, and Qaanaaq. </p>

<p>He explained that customers in these regions have waited too long for reliable service. The goal is to close that gap and bring them online at a much higher standard.</p>



<h2>An Improvement</h2>



<figure data-wp-context="{&quot;imageId&quot;:&quot;68f873b7ada92&quot;}" data-wp-interactive="core/image"><img decoding="async" data-wp-class--hide="state.isContentHidden" data-wp-class--show="state.isContentVisible" data-wp-init="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-async--click="actions.showLightbox" data-wp-on-async--load="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-async-window--resize="callbacks.setButtonStyles" src="https://media.mgdk.dk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/Shutterstock_2434412393-1024x512.png" alt="Satellite, space, orbit, tech, global"><figcaption>Shutterstock.com</figcaption></figure>



<p>Eutelsat is a major player in global satellite communications. Its OneWeb satellites orbit closer to Earth than traditional ones, which allows for faster and more reliable signals. </p>



<p>The company says the partnership will help connect isolated communities, support critical infrastructure, and improve maritime safety and rescue operations.</p>



<p>The first area to benefit will be Tasiilaq, which is expected to gain access before the end of the year. Other communities will follow as Tusass expands the network.</p>



<h2>Starlink Was Considered</h2>



<figure data-wp-context="{&quot;imageId&quot;:&quot;68f873b7aded0&quot;}" data-wp-interactive="core/image"><img decoding="async" data-wp-class--hide="state.isContentHidden" data-wp-class--show="state.isContentVisible" data-wp-init="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-async--click="actions.showLightbox" data-wp-on-async--load="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-async-window--resize="callbacks.setButtonStyles" src="https://media.mgdk.dk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/Elon-Musk-Grok-1024x532.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>Photo Agency / Shutterstock.com</figcaption></figure>



<p>Tusass had also been in talks with Starlink, owned by Elon Musk, but chose to continue working with Eutelsat. </p>



	<div x-data="{
        posts: [],
        loadPosts() {
            try {
                const relatedPostData = JSON.parse(document.getElementById('related-post-data').textContent);
                if (!relatedPostData.length) return;
                let postsToShow = relatedPostData.slice(4);
                                postsToShow = postsToShow.slice(0, 2);
                                this.posts = postsToShow;
            } catch (error) {
                console.error('Error loading related posts:', error);

<p>Binzer said it was not about which company was better, but about trust and long-term cooperation. Tusass already works with Eutelsat and knows their systems well.</p>



<h2>Maintaining Greenlandic Control</h2>



<figure data-wp-context="{&quot;imageId&quot;:&quot;68f873b7ae2be&quot;}" data-wp-interactive="core/image"><img decoding="async" data-wp-class--hide="state.isContentHidden" data-wp-class--show="state.isContentVisible" data-wp-init="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-async--click="actions.showLightbox" data-wp-on-async--load="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-async-window--resize="callbacks.setButtonStyles" src="https://media.mgdk.dk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/Shutterstock_2538006591-1-1024x512.jpg" alt="Grønland, greenland, flag"><figcaption>ACERS_FOTO/Shutterstock</figcaption></figure>



<p>Some Greenlandic politicians have warned that the country must keep control of its telecom infrastructure. </p>



<p>They fear that opening the market to foreign providers could threaten national security. For now, Tusass remains the sole provider of telecommunications in Greenland.</p>



<p>Binzer said the company will keep an open mind for future partnerships, but the priority remains clear. Greenland’s communication systems must stay under Greenlandic control.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="auto"><p>Strix Halo is the codename for AMD’s highest end mobile chip, which is used in the Ryzen AI MAX series. It combines a powerful CPU with 16 Zen 5 cores and a large GPU with 20 RDNA 3.5 Workgroup Processors (WGPs). The sizeable iGPU makes Strix Halo particularly interesting because GPUs have high bandwidth requirements. Strix Halo tackles that with a 256-bit LPDDR5X-8000 setup combined with 32 MB of memory side cache. The latter is often referred to as Infinity Cache, or MALL (Memory Attached Last Level). I’ll refer to it as Infinity Cache for brevity.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Il1z!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7bdb0948-6a82-4441-927a-4dcdce851029_847x714.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Il1z!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7bdb0948-6a82-4441-927a-4dcdce851029_847x714.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Il1z!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7bdb0948-6a82-4441-927a-4dcdce851029_847x714.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Il1z!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7bdb0948-6a82-4441-927a-4dcdce851029_847x714.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Il1z!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7bdb0948-6a82-4441-927a-4dcdce851029_847x714.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Il1z!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7bdb0948-6a82-4441-927a-4dcdce851029_847x714.png" width="847" height="714" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/7bdb0948-6a82-4441-927a-4dcdce851029_847x714.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:714,&quot;width&quot;:847,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Il1z!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7bdb0948-6a82-4441-927a-4dcdce851029_847x714.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Il1z!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7bdb0948-6a82-4441-927a-4dcdce851029_847x714.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Il1z!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7bdb0948-6a82-4441-927a-4dcdce851029_847x714.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Il1z!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7bdb0948-6a82-4441-927a-4dcdce851029_847x714.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Infinity Cache has been around since RDNA2 in AMD’s discrete consumer GPU lineup, where it helped AMD hit high performance targets with lower DRAM bandwidth requirements. However, Infinity Cache’s efficacy has so far been difficult for me to evaluate. AMD’s discrete GPUs have performance monitoring facilities accessible through AMD’s developer tools. But those tools stop providing information past L2. Strix Halo stands out because it has an Infinity Cache implementation, and all the accessible performance monitoring features typical of a recent AMD GPU. That includes programmable performance counters at Infinity Fabric and memory controllers. It’s an opportunity to finally get insight into how well AMD’s Infinity Cache does its job in various graphics workloads.</p><p>Special thanks goes out to ASUS for sampling their ROG Flow Z13. This device implements AMD’s Ryzen AI MAX+ 395 with 32 GB of LPDDR5X in a thin and light form factor. It superficially represents a convertible tablet from Microsoft’s Surface line, and is remarkably portable for a device with gaming credentials. Without ASUS’s help, this article wouldn’t have been possible.</p><p>AMD’s Infinity Fabric aims to abstract away details of how data travels across the chip. It does so by providing endpoints with well defined interfaces to let blocks make or handle memory requests. Infinity Fabric also provides a set of programmable performance counters. AMD documents a single DATA_BW performance event that counts data beats at endpoints. DATA_BW targets an endpoint via its 8-bit instance ID, and can count either reads or writes. AMD never documented Infinity Fabric instance IDs for Strix Halo. So, I did some guessing by generating traffic at various blocks and observing bandwidth counts at all possible instance IDs.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!cH9c!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb9c7e404-6987-45a7-8816-916580073352_959x411.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!cH9c!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb9c7e404-6987-45a7-8816-916580073352_959x411.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!cH9c!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb9c7e404-6987-45a7-8816-916580073352_959x411.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!cH9c!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb9c7e404-6987-45a7-8816-916580073352_959x411.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!cH9c!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb9c7e404-6987-45a7-8816-916580073352_959x411.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!cH9c!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb9c7e404-6987-45a7-8816-916580073352_959x411.png" width="959" height="411" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b9c7e404-6987-45a7-8816-916580073352_959x411.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:411,&quot;width&quot;:959,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!cH9c!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb9c7e404-6987-45a7-8816-916580073352_959x411.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!cH9c!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb9c7e404-6987-45a7-8816-916580073352_959x411.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!cH9c!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb9c7e404-6987-45a7-8816-916580073352_959x411.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!cH9c!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb9c7e404-6987-45a7-8816-916580073352_959x411.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Instance IDs start from the Coherent Stations (CS-es), just like on server platforms. CS blocks sit in front of memory controllers and ensure cache coherency by probing another block if it might have a modified copy of the requested cacheline. If it doesn’t, which is most of the time, the CS will pass the request on to its attached Unified Memory Controller (UMC). Because CS blocks observe all requests to physical memory backed by DRAM, it’s a logical place to implement a memory side cache. That’s exactly what AMD does on chips with Infinity Cache. Cache hits let the CS avoid going to the UMC.</p><p>Strix Halo has 16 memory controllers and CS instances, each handling a 16-bit LPDDR5X channel. The GPU occupies the next eight instance IDs, suggesting it has a wide interface to Infinity Fabric. CPU core clusters come next. Each octa-core Zen 5 Core Complex (CCX) connects to Infinity Fabric via one endpoint. Miscellaneous blocks follow. These include the NPU, media engine, the display engine, and a mystery.</p><p>Cache misses usually cause a request to the next level in the memory hierarchy, while cache hits do not. Therefore, my idea is to compare traffic levels at the CS and UMC levels. Traffic that shows up at the CS but not at the UMCs can be used as a proxy for Infinity Cache hits. There are a few problems with that approach though.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!FxOO!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07bf475d-4ec5-4a2b-b748-bb0094222fc8_1101x358.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!FxOO!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07bf475d-4ec5-4a2b-b748-bb0094222fc8_1101x358.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!FxOO!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07bf475d-4ec5-4a2b-b748-bb0094222fc8_1101x358.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!FxOO!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07bf475d-4ec5-4a2b-b748-bb0094222fc8_1101x358.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!FxOO!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07bf475d-4ec5-4a2b-b748-bb0094222fc8_1101x358.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!FxOO!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07bf475d-4ec5-4a2b-b748-bb0094222fc8_1101x358.png" width="1101" height="358" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/07bf475d-4ec5-4a2b-b748-bb0094222fc8_1101x358.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:358,&quot;width&quot;:1101,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!FxOO!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07bf475d-4ec5-4a2b-b748-bb0094222fc8_1101x358.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!FxOO!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07bf475d-4ec5-4a2b-b748-bb0094222fc8_1101x358.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!FxOO!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07bf475d-4ec5-4a2b-b748-bb0094222fc8_1101x358.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!FxOO!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07bf475d-4ec5-4a2b-b748-bb0094222fc8_1101x358.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>First, Strix Halo only provides eight Infinity Fabric performance counters. I have to use two counters per endpoint to count both read and write data beats, so I can only monitor four CS-es simultaneously. Memory traffic is interleaved across channels, so taking bandwidth observed at four CS-es and multiplying by four should give a reasonably accurate estimate of overall bandwidth. But interleaving isn’t perfectly even in practice, so I expect a few percentage points of error. The UMC situation is easier. Each UMC has its own set of four performance counters, letting me monitor all of them at the same time. I’m using one counter per UMC to count Column Address Strobe (CAS) commands. Other available UMC events allow monitoring memory controller frequency, bus utilization, and ACTIVATE or PRECHARGE commands. But that stuff goes beyond what I want to focus on here, and collecting more data points would make for annoyingly large spreadsheets.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!HXhV!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2caf6cd2-64db-48f1-bd75-d9fbf4cd3632_800x216.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!HXhV!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2caf6cd2-64db-48f1-bd75-d9fbf4cd3632_800x216.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!HXhV!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2caf6cd2-64db-48f1-bd75-d9fbf4cd3632_800x216.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!HXhV!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2caf6cd2-64db-48f1-bd75-d9fbf4cd3632_800x216.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!HXhV!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2caf6cd2-64db-48f1-bd75-d9fbf4cd3632_800x216.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!HXhV!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2caf6cd2-64db-48f1-bd75-d9fbf4cd3632_800x216.png" width="800" height="216" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2caf6cd2-64db-48f1-bd75-d9fbf4cd3632_800x216.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:216,&quot;width&quot;:800,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!HXhV!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2caf6cd2-64db-48f1-bd75-d9fbf4cd3632_800x216.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!HXhV!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2caf6cd2-64db-48f1-bd75-d9fbf4cd3632_800x216.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!HXhV!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2caf6cd2-64db-48f1-bd75-d9fbf4cd3632_800x216.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!HXhV!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2caf6cd2-64db-48f1-bd75-d9fbf4cd3632_800x216.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Cross-CCX traffic presents a second source of error as mentioned above. If a CS sends a probe that hits a modified line, it won’t send a request to the UMC. The request is still being satisfied out of cache, just not the Infinity Cache that I’m interested in. I expect this to be rare because cross-CCX traffic in general is usually low compared to requests satisfied from DRAM. It’ll be especially rare in the graphics workloads I’m targeting here because Strix Halo’s second CCD tends to be parked in Windows.</p><p><span>CPU-side traffic in general presents a more significant issue. Strix Halo’s Infinity Cache narrowly targets the GPU, and </span><a href="https://chipsandcheese.com/p/amds-strix-halo-under-the-hood" rel="">only GPU-side memory requests cause cache fills</a><span>. CPU memory accesses will be counted as misses in a hitrate calculation. That may be technically correct, but misses the point of Infinity Cache. Most memory traffic comes from the GPU, but there’s enough CPU-side traffic to create a bit more of an error bar than I’d like. Therefore, I want to focus on whether Infinity Cache is handling enough traffic to avoid hitting DRAM bandwidth bottlenecks.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!aNVH!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb7b48d2a-ec15-44ef-bfba-cd5edcffd261_1412x451.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!aNVH!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb7b48d2a-ec15-44ef-bfba-cd5edcffd261_1412x451.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!aNVH!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb7b48d2a-ec15-44ef-bfba-cd5edcffd261_1412x451.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!aNVH!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb7b48d2a-ec15-44ef-bfba-cd5edcffd261_1412x451.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!aNVH!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb7b48d2a-ec15-44ef-bfba-cd5edcffd261_1412x451.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!aNVH!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb7b48d2a-ec15-44ef-bfba-cd5edcffd261_1412x451.png" width="1412" height="451" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b7b48d2a-ec15-44ef-bfba-cd5edcffd261_1412x451.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:451,&quot;width&quot;:1412,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!aNVH!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb7b48d2a-ec15-44ef-bfba-cd5edcffd261_1412x451.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!aNVH!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb7b48d2a-ec15-44ef-bfba-cd5edcffd261_1412x451.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!aNVH!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb7b48d2a-ec15-44ef-bfba-cd5edcffd261_1412x451.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!aNVH!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb7b48d2a-ec15-44ef-bfba-cd5edcffd261_1412x451.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Traffic captured at the CCD endpoints and two of the GPU’s (multiplied by 4)</figcaption></figure></div><p>A final limitation is that I’m sampling performance counters with a tool I wrote years ago. I wrote it so I could look at hardware performance stats just like how I like looking at Task Manager or other monitoring utilities to see how my system is doing. Because I’m updating a graphical interface, I sample data every second and thus have lower resolution compared to some vendor tools. Those can often sample at millisecond granularity or better. That opens the window to underestimating bandwidth demands if a bandwidth spike only occurs over a small fraction of a second. In theory I could write another tool. But Chips and Cheese is an unpaid hobby project that has to be balanced with a separate full time job as well as other free time interests. Quickly rigging an existing project to do my bidding makes more efficient use of time, because there’s never enough time to do everything I want.</p><p>I logged data over some arbitrarily selected graphics workloads, then selected the 1-second interval with the highest DRAM bandwidth usage. That should give an idea of whether Strix Halo comes close to reaching DRAM bandwidth limits. Overall, the 32 MB cache seems to do its job. Strix Halo is able to stay well clear of the 256 GB/s theoretical bandwidth limit that its LPDDR5X-8000 setup can deliver.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!C1NN!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F49e44e20-a4f7-46ad-9eff-3849449cf6d6_1254x765.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!C1NN!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F49e44e20-a4f7-46ad-9eff-3849449cf6d6_1254x765.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!C1NN!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F49e44e20-a4f7-46ad-9eff-3849449cf6d6_1254x765.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!C1NN!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F49e44e20-a4f7-46ad-9eff-3849449cf6d6_1254x765.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!C1NN!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F49e44e20-a4f7-46ad-9eff-3849449cf6d6_1254x765.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!C1NN!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F49e44e20-a4f7-46ad-9eff-3849449cf6d6_1254x765.png" width="1254" height="765" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/49e44e20-a4f7-46ad-9eff-3849449cf6d6_1254x765.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:765,&quot;width&quot;:1254,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!C1NN!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F49e44e20-a4f7-46ad-9eff-3849449cf6d6_1254x765.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!C1NN!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F49e44e20-a4f7-46ad-9eff-3849449cf6d6_1254x765.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!C1NN!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F49e44e20-a4f7-46ad-9eff-3849449cf6d6_1254x765.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!C1NN!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F49e44e20-a4f7-46ad-9eff-3849449cf6d6_1254x765.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Approximate CS-side bandwidth demands do indicate several workloads can push uncomfortably close to 256 GB/s.

Strix Halo has the same 2 MB of graphics L2 cache that AMD’s older 7000 series “Phoenix” mobile chip had, despite more than doubling GPU compute throughput. Unsurprisingly, the GPU can draw a lot of bandwidth across Infinity Fabric. 3DMark Time Spy again stands out. If AMD wanted to simply scale up DRAM bandwidth without spending die area on cache, they would need well over 335 GB/s from DRAM.</p><p>Curiously, Digital Foundry notes that Strix Halo has very similar graphics performance to the PS5. The PS5 uses a 256-bit, 14 GT/s GDDR6 setup that’s good for 448 GB/s of theoretical bandwidth, and doesn’t have a memory side cache like Strix Halo. 448 GB/s looks just about adequate for satisfying Time Spy Extreme’s bandwidth needs, if just barely. If Strix Halo didn’t need to work in power constrained mobile devices, and didn’t need high memory capacity for multitasking, perhaps AMD could have considered a GDDR6 setup. To bring things back around to Infinity Cache, it seems to do very well at that interval above. It captures approximately 73% of memory traffic going through Infinity Fabric, which is good even from a hitrate point of view.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!yi5W!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5319a316-0b50-475c-8e70-29c8fa1fe6c5_1520x761.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!yi5W!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5319a316-0b50-475c-8e70-29c8fa1fe6c5_1520x761.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!yi5W!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5319a316-0b50-475c-8e70-29c8fa1fe6c5_1520x761.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!yi5W!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5319a316-0b50-475c-8e70-29c8fa1fe6c5_1520x761.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!yi5W!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5319a316-0b50-475c-8e70-29c8fa1fe6c5_1520x761.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!yi5W!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5319a316-0b50-475c-8e70-29c8fa1fe6c5_1520x761.png" width="1456" height="729" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5319a316-0b50-475c-8e70-29c8fa1fe6c5_1520x761.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:729,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!yi5W!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5319a316-0b50-475c-8e70-29c8fa1fe6c5_1520x761.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!yi5W!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5319a316-0b50-475c-8e70-29c8fa1fe6c5_1520x761.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!yi5W!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5319a316-0b50-475c-8e70-29c8fa1fe6c5_1520x761.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!yi5W!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5319a316-0b50-475c-8e70-29c8fa1fe6c5_1520x761.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>The two bar graphs above already hint at how bandwidth demands and cache hitrates vary across workloads.

Plotting the percentage of traffic at the CS not observed at the UMCs as a proxy for hitrate further emphasizes that point.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wEdj!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F487baf64-b146-4177-b647-e92b33c1cef3_1515x766.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wEdj!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F487baf64-b146-4177-b647-e92b33c1cef3_1515x766.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wEdj!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F487baf64-b146-4177-b647-e92b33c1cef3_1515x766.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wEdj!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F487baf64-b146-4177-b647-e92b33c1cef3_1515x766.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wEdj!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F487baf64-b146-4177-b647-e92b33c1cef3_1515x766.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wEdj!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F487baf64-b146-4177-b647-e92b33c1cef3_1515x766.png" width="1456" height="736" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/487baf64-b146-4177-b647-e92b33c1cef3_1515x766.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:736,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wEdj!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F487baf64-b146-4177-b647-e92b33c1cef3_1515x766.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wEdj!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F487baf64-b146-4177-b647-e92b33c1cef3_1515x766.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wEdj!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F487baf64-b146-4177-b647-e92b33c1cef3_1515x766.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wEdj!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F487baf64-b146-4177-b647-e92b33c1cef3_1515x766.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Resolution settings can impact cache hitrate as well.

Taking a simplistic view and tripling maximum observed 8K bandwidth demands would give a figure just north of 525 GB/s. But Strix Halo’s iGPU clearly wasn’t built with such a scenario in mind, and AMD’s selected combination of cache capacity and DRAM bandwidth works well enough at all tested resolutions. While high resolutions create the most DRAM traffic, 1080P shows the heaviest bandwidth demands at the Infinity Fabric level.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Q1FQ!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3a35935a-a75a-4e3a-9148-1f5411cbff0e_1360x753.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Q1FQ!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3a35935a-a75a-4e3a-9148-1f5411cbff0e_1360x753.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Q1FQ!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3a35935a-a75a-4e3a-9148-1f5411cbff0e_1360x753.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Q1FQ!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3a35935a-a75a-4e3a-9148-1f5411cbff0e_1360x753.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Q1FQ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3a35935a-a75a-4e3a-9148-1f5411cbff0e_1360x753.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Q1FQ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3a35935a-a75a-4e3a-9148-1f5411cbff0e_1360x753.png" width="1360" height="753" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3a35935a-a75a-4e3a-9148-1f5411cbff0e_1360x753.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:753,&quot;width&quot;:1360,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Q1FQ!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3a35935a-a75a-4e3a-9148-1f5411cbff0e_1360x753.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Q1FQ!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3a35935a-a75a-4e3a-9148-1f5411cbff0e_1360x753.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Q1FQ!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3a35935a-a75a-4e3a-9148-1f5411cbff0e_1360x753.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Q1FQ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3a35935a-a75a-4e3a-9148-1f5411cbff0e_1360x753.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>3DMark Wild Life Extreme is a better example because it’s a lightweight benchmark designed to run on mobile devices.

Over a decade ago, Intel created “halo” iGPU variants and paired a 128 MB eDRAM cache while sticking with a typical 128-bit client memory bus. AMD’s console chips use large and fast DRAM buses. The PS5 is one example. Strix Halo does a bit of both. It combines modest cache capacity with a more DRAM bandwidth than typical client chips, but doesn’t rely as much on DRAM bandwidth as console chips.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!FxEQ!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F32a3cead-075c-4b4e-b4e4-f7c89bbba388_1600x851.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!FxEQ!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F32a3cead-075c-4b4e-b4e4-f7c89bbba388_1600x851.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!FxEQ!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F32a3cead-075c-4b4e-b4e4-f7c89bbba388_1600x851.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!FxEQ!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F32a3cead-075c-4b4e-b4e4-f7c89bbba388_1600x851.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!FxEQ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F32a3cead-075c-4b4e-b4e4-f7c89bbba388_1600x851.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!FxEQ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F32a3cead-075c-4b4e-b4e4-f7c89bbba388_1600x851.png" width="1456" height="774" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/32a3cead-075c-4b4e-b4e4-f7c89bbba388_1600x851.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:774,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!FxEQ!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F32a3cead-075c-4b4e-b4e4-f7c89bbba388_1600x851.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!FxEQ!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F32a3cead-075c-4b4e-b4e4-f7c89bbba388_1600x851.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!FxEQ!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F32a3cead-075c-4b4e-b4e4-f7c89bbba388_1600x851.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!FxEQ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F32a3cead-075c-4b4e-b4e4-f7c89bbba388_1600x851.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Those varied approaches to the bandwidth problem are fascinating. Watching how Infinity Cache behaves in various graphics workloads has been fascinating as well. But everything would be so much more fun if AMD’s tools provided direct data on Infinity Cache hitrates. That applies to both integrated and discrete GPUs. Infinity Cache is a well established part of AMD’s strategy. It has been around for several generations, and now has a presence in AMD’s mobile lineup too. I suspect developers would love to see Infinity Cache hitrates in addition to the data on GPU-private caches that AMD’s current tools show.</p><p><span>If you like the content then consider heading over to the </span><a href="https://www.patreon.com/ChipsandCheese" rel="">Patreon</a><span> or </span><a href="https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=4EMPH66SBGVSQ" rel="">PayPal</a><span> if you want to toss a few bucks to Chips and Cheese.

<p>And Oxycyte was ideal for the group’s 2021 Ig Nobel-winning efforts. The experiments involved intra-anally administering oxygen gas or a liquid oxygenated perfluorocarbon to the unfortunate rodents and porcines. Yes, they gave the animals enemas. They then induced respiratory failure and evaluated the effectiveness of the intra-anal treatment. The result: Both treatments were pretty darned effective at staving off respiratory failure with no major complications.</p>

<p>So far, so good. The next logical step was to determine if EVA could work in human patients, too. “Patients with severe respiratory failure often need mechanical ventilation to survive, but these therapies can cause further lung injury,” the authors wrote in this latest paper. EVA “could give the lungs a chance to rest and heal.”</p>
<p>The team recruited 27 healthy adult men in Japan, each of whom received a dose of non-oxygenated perfluorodecalin via the anus. They were asked to retain the liquid for a full hour as the dosage slowly increased from 25 to 1,500 mL. Twenty of the men successfully completed the experiment. Apart from mild temporary abdominal bloating and discomfort—which proved to be dosage dependent and resolved with no need for medical attention—they experienced no adverse effects.</p>
<p>“This is the first human data and the results are limited solely to demonstrating the safety of the procedure and not its effectiveness,” <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1102615">said co-author Takanori Takebe</a> of Cincinnati Children’s Hospital and the University of Osaka in Japan. “But now that we have established tolerance, the next step will be to evaluate how effective the process is for delivering oxygen to the bloodstream.”</p>

  <p><em>[Note that this article is a transcript of the video embedded above.]</em></p><p>Niagara Falls is one of the most spectacular waterfalls in the world. With a vertical drop of more than 50 meters or 164 feet and a flow rate that often exceeds 2800 cubic meters per second or 100,000 cubic feet per second, it’s one of North America’s crown jewels. Roughly ten million people visit the falls every year just to catch a glimpse of the curtains of water pouring over the edge and the constant clouds of mist at the bottom. But Niagara Falls isn’t just a tourist attraction. The special geology and hydrology of this region, situated between Lake Erie and Lake Ontario, have resulted in some fascinating feats of infrastructure, from shipping to electricity to water control. It’s basically a microcosm of all the things I love. The falls themselves have required quite a bit of engineering over the years, and they’ve even been shut off for maintenance. Let’s take a little tour of the Niagara Peninsula (even though it’s really an isthmus), and I’ll show you some of the things that aren’t usually listed in a guidebook. I’m Grady, and this is Practical Engineering.</p><p>Let’s get oriented first. This is a map of the isthmus. We’ve got Lake Erie to the south, Lake Ontario to the north, Buffalo and western New York to the East, and Ontario, Canada, to the west. The Niagara River runs northward, connecting the two great lakes. And right in the middle, it plunges off the Niagara Escarpment, creating the famous falls. On the US side, there are the American Falls and the smaller Bridal Veil Falls. And on the Canadian side is the Horseshoe Falls where a majority of the river flows. It’s pretty impressive to see in person, but it’s actually not entirely a benefit. Because these falls pose a major problem for shipping.</p><p>The Great Lakes form the largest inland freshwater transportation system in the world. Since the 19th century, they’ve served as the backbone for moving iron ore, coal, grain, and manufactured goods between the American heartland and the Atlantic Ocean. Ore from Minnesota and grain from the Midwest can travel by ship all the way to steel mills or export terminals on the East Coast. Barges and freighters are efficient at moving bulk cargo in a way rail and trucks can’t match. For a time, the Niagara Escarpment was a natural bottleneck between Lake Erie and Lake Ontario, preventing goods from moving directly between the upper lakes and the Atlantic. Freight had to be offloaded and portaged around the falls before it could continue its journey. The Erie Canal solved the problem somewhat, starting in 1825, bypassing Lake Ontario. But it could only accommodate smaller vessels, and even before the Canal opened, another solution was being planned.</p><p>The Welland Canal runs through the peninsula west of the Niagara River, connecting two massive areas by shipping traffic for the first time in 1829. The canal fueled the early growth of cities along the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence River - including Cleveland, Detroit, Milwaukee, Chicago, Toronto, Montreal, and Quebec City - and it’s been rebuilt and moved several times over its life. The Welland Canal is really a titanic engineering achievement and, were it not positioned next to one of the natural wonders of the world, it would probably be famous in its own right. Because of the huge difference in elevation between the two lakes created by the escarpment, eight separate locks are required to allow ships to traverse between them. And all different kinds do - from personal leisure craft to the lakers that stay in fresh water to the salties that travel between the lakes and the ocean through the St. Lawrence Seaway.</p><p>Starting on the upstream, Lake Erie side of the canal, the first lock isn’t really for lifting or lowering ships so much as for control. The level of Lake Erie actually fluctuates throughout the year, and there are longer-term trends as well. Wind storms also raise the level locally similar to the way storm surge works during hurricanes. The control lock does just that: it controls the level in the downstream canal. It prevents excess water from rushing down the canal when the lake is high, kind of like an airlock on a spaceship keeps air from rushing out when astronauts step outside for a spacewalk.</p><p>Downstream of the control lock, the canal splits in two. The original pathway of the canal flows through the eponymous town of Welland, while the larger and newer section of canal, the Welland Bypass… well, it bypasses Welland to the east. If you look carefully, you’ll also notice a small river, the Welland River, which passes underneath both the original and bypass canals. On the way downstream from Lake Erie to Lake Ontario, shipping traffic passes over aqueducts that pass over a natural river. A hydrological wonderland!</p><p>Continuing downstream from the aqueducts, the remaining seven locks are lift locks, more like what you think of when you imagine a lock. Notice how they’re clustered tightly around the terrain and not distributed evenly along the length of the canal. That’s the Niagara escarpment, the same geological feature that the water cascades down at the falls. This is the elevation diagram of the entire Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Seaway system from Lake Superior to the Atlantic Ocean, and you can see that this drop is the biggest one of the whole thing. And that’s pretty important for another part of the infrastructure on the peninsula.</p><p>The power available from a moving fluid is directly proportional to the flow rate multiplied by the height of the drop. In most hydropower applications, that height is created artificially by a dam. There aren’t that many places in the world where you have both a large volume of flowing water and a significant natural drop in elevation. But that combination made Niagara Falls the birthplace of large-scale electric power in North America. In 1895, the Niagara Power Company opened the Edward Dean Adams Power Plant, built with Westinghouse AC generators based on the ideas and patents of Nikola Tesla. The plant served as the basis for the modern electrical grids we have today, and many of the fundamental concepts are basically unchanged.</p><p>But the power infrastructure at Niagara Falls definitely has changed. Where the Adams Power Plant put out about 40 megawatts of power in 1895, now the combined capacity from the region is in the neighborhood of 5 gigawatts. But in both cases, it wasn’t as simple as putting a turbine at the base of the falls. While it might be technically possible to generate power by placing a water wheel directly in the stream of a waterfall like a kid’s bath toy, it’s not the most efficient way (plus it would take away from the beauty). The water used to power the hydroelectric plants on both the US and Canadian sides of the Niagara River is water that never actually flows over the falls. Instead, it’s diverted into five massive tunnels - two on the US side and three on the Canadian side.</p><p>Like most tunnels, you can’t really see the extent of the hydro tunnels at Niagara Falls. There are a few conspicuous clues though, like these gigantic buildings. These interesting protrusions from the landscape house enormous steel doors, nearly 60 feet tall, that can drop down into the tunnels and close off the flow for inspections and maintenance. Both the Ontario and New York sides of the river feature similar structures.</p><p>From the tunnels, water flows into major hydropower plants on both sides of the border: the twin Adam Beck stations on the Canadian side and Robert Moses station on the US side. Then it’s released into the the lower part of the river below the falls. When you add them up, that’s 39 turbines with a combined capacity of more than 4000 megawatts. It’s a tremendous amount of power generation in one place. But actually, that’s not all of it.</p><p>These tunnels divert 50-75% of the flow of the Niagara River. That wide range in percentage of diversion isn’t because we don’t know how much is diverted, but because we actually control how much water is diverted, depending on the tourist requirements agreed upon in a treaty by both nations. During the day in peak tourist season, more water is allowed to flow over the falls to ensure the grandeur of the falls is on full display for the huge crowds of tourists that visit every year. At night and during the winter, more of the flow is diverted to generate power. That’s all managed by this structure upstream of the falls: the international control dam.</p><p>I’ve always thought this is an interesting dam, since it doesn’t even go all the way across the river. But it doesn’t need to. This structure’s not meant to create a reservoir; it just subtly adjusts the level in the river to control how much water flows over the falls versus into the hydropower intakes. The US side of the Niagara River is pretty shallow, so that side acts kind of like an uncontrolled spillway. Then, the gates on the Canadian side can be adjusted to balance the competing demands on water between tourism and power.</p><p>But there’s one big problem with those competing needs: they both have the same timing. We want thunderous cascades of water over the falls during the day when tourists are visiting, but daytime is also when the demand for electricity is highest. It’s like if solar panels only worked at night. To accommodate this, both the US and Canada have pumped storage plants. At night, excess electricity is used to pump diverted water into reservoirs, essentially storing both the power and the extra water that’s available during off-peak hours. Then, during the day, the water is released back into the forebay of the power plants. You get a little extra power from that drop out of the reservoir into the forebays, so both sides have small hydropower facilities to capture that. But more importantly, you get a lot more water during the day than would otherwise be available to run through the big plants, making more power when it’s needed most. And there’s just something funny to me that the infrastructure is duplicated on both sides of the river, like neither country was willing to be one-upped by the other.</p><p>All of this diversion noticeably reduces the flow of water over the falls. Even when they are at ‘full blast’ during the day in the tourist season, only 50% of the flow of the Niagara River makes it over the falls. You can imagine how powerful the falls would be if 100% of the flow were to cascade over. It might seem like this diversion detracts from the majesty of the falls, but in another sense, it actually preserves it. </p><p>All waterfalls undergo some degree of erosion as the water and sediment suspended in it scours away the rocks and soil underneath. Without any diversion, Niagara Falls would be receding towards Lake Erie at a rate of about 3 feet every year. At the end of the last ice age, the falls were right at the edge of the Niagara Escarpment, but thousands of years of erosion have caused them to work their way upstream. You can actually see how far it’s already progressed by looking at this elevation map. Over the last 12,000 years or so, the falls have migrated by erosion to their current location. By diverting a significant portion of the flow, the power plants have actually slowed the rate of erosion to approximately one foot per year, which will help preserve the falls for a longer period.</p><p>While flow on the falls is downregulated by diversion for hydropower, the falls are never ‘turned off’...except for the one time in the 1960s. The smaller American Falls (and nearby Bridal Veil Falls) have a pile of loose rocks and boulders, called talus, at their base. This pile of rocky debris actually extends a good fraction of the way up the falls, and officials worried that the falls might ultimately transition into a series of rapids cascading down the slope of talus rather than remaining a majestic waterfall. So, in 1969, the Army Corps of Engineers built a temporary cofferdam between the New York shoreline and Goat Island, diverting the water over the Canadian Horseshoe Falls and leaving the American Falls dry(ish)!</p><p>After the engineers got a chance to inspect the situation, they determined that the best course of action was just to leave the majority of the talus in place, since it seemed to be stabilizing the cliff face. Sometimes, doing mostly nothing is a decision you make as an engineer, even if you have to do a monumental amount of work to come to that conclusion. So the cofferdam was taken out, and water has flowed continuously over all the falls since then.</p><p>It really highlights the complexity of Niagara Falls. On the one hand, you have one of the natural wonders of the world, an absolutely enormous set of waterfalls that inspire awe and wonder in the countless travelers who are lucky enough to take in the view. The same thing that makes it impressive for tourists (the big drop) makes it valuable for power and a major challenge for shipping. And out of that comes all kinds of fascinating infrastructure, not only to facilitate the tourism but the other stuff too: a major canal with locks and aqueducts, the international dam control gates, pumped storage reservoirs, epic tunnels, towering gates, massive hydropower plants, and so much more. It’s really a pretty remarkable place for engineering.</p>

I was lounging in my pajamas, idly scrolling through Netflix, having spent the morning reading news stories, occasionally tweeting, and watching TV. It was a rare day off.<br></p><p>Then my phone lit up with a notification. I glanced down at the message.<br></p><p>“Anna, Lindsey Halligan here,” it began.&nbsp;</p><p>Lindsey Halligan—the top prosecutor in the Eastern District of Virginia—was texting me. As it turned out, she was texting me about a criminal case she is pursuing against one of the president’s perceived political enemies: New York Attorney General Letitia James.<br></p><p>So began my two-day text correspondence with the woman President Donald Trump had installed, in no small part, to bring the very prosecution she was now discussing with me by text message.<br></p><p>Over the next 33 hours, Halligan texted me again.<br></p><p>And again.&nbsp;<br></p><p>And again.&nbsp;</p><p>And again.<br></p><p>Through the whole of our correspondence, however, there is something Halligan never said: She never said a word suggesting that she was not “on the record.”</p><p>It is not uncommon for federal prosecutors to communicate with the press, both through formal channels and sometimes informally. My exchange with Halligan, however, was highly unusual in a number of respects. She initiated a conversation with me, a reporter she barely knew, to discuss an ongoing prosecution that she is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/27/us/politics/trump-comey-justice-department.html" data-sf-ec-immutable="">personally handling</a>. She mostly criticized my reporting—or, more precisely, my summary of someone else’s reporting. But several of her messages contained language that touched on grand jury matters, even as she insisted that she could not reveal such information,&nbsp; which is protected from disclosure by prosecutors under federal law.<br></p><p>As a legal journalist covering the Justice Department, I had never encountered anything quite like my exchange with Halligan. Neither had my editor. Over the last several days, he and I spoke with multiple former federal officials and journalists who cover the justice system. None could recall a similar instance in which a sitting U.S. attorney reached out to chastise a reporter about matters concerning grand jury testimony in an active case.</p><p><a href="https://givebutter.com/journalism" target="_blank" data-sf-ec-immutable=""><img src="https://lawfare-assets-new.azureedge.net/assets/images/default-source/article-images/support-lawfare8495e13b-9c80-42f6-ac96-e96789089124.png?sfvrsn=86c5a5d4_3" height="62" width="206" alt="" sf-size="69672"></a></p><p>Justice Department spokeswoman Natalie Baldassarre confirmed the authenticity of the texts at 4:34 p.m.&nbsp;today, responding to my questions about the exchange with a statement that reads in its entirety:</p><blockquote>You clearly didn’t get the response you wanted—which was information handed over to you without having to dig into the facts of the case to craft a truthful story—so you thought you’d “tattletale” to main justice. Lindsay [sic] Halligan was attempting to point you to facts, not gossip, but when clarifying that she would adhere to the rule of the law and not disclose Grand Jury information, you threaten to leak an entire conversation. Good luck ever getting anyone to talk to you when you publish their texts.</blockquote><p>After I reached out to the department for comment on Halligan’s texts, Halligan texted me yet again, for the first time in several days, insisting that our entire correspondence had been off the record. Our full exchange, linked below, allows readers to make their own judgments on that question.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>***</strong><br></p><p>As with many Trumpworld stories, this one began with someone getting sacked. That someone was Erik Siebert, Halligan’s predecessor as the U.S. Attorney in eastern Virginia, who was removed—or <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/19/us/politics/erik-siebert-comey-letitia-james.html" data-sf-ec-immutable="">forced to resign</a>—last month.&nbsp;</p><p>According to <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/us-attorney-plans-resign-amid-pressure-trump-after/story?id=125750006" data-sf-ec-immutable="">multiple</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/19/us/politics/erik-siebert-comey-letitia-james.html" data-sf-ec-immutable="">reports</a>, Siebert had raised doubts that the evidence was strong enough to pursue criminal charges against two of President Trump’s longtime adversaries: New York Attorney General Letitia James, who won a civil fraud verdict against the Trump Organization, and former FBI Director James Comey, whom Trump had fired during his first term in office and had long blamed for the so-called “Russiagate” investigation. For years, Trump has publicly said that Comey and James should be punished for <em>something</em>. But Siebert <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/19/us/politics/erik-siebert-comey-letitia-james.html" data-sf-ec-immutable="">reportedly balked</a> at the idea of bringing criminal charges that he thought lacked merit. After news of his objections surfaced in the press, he abruptly departed.<br></p><p>The fallout was swift. That weekend, in the wake of Siebert’s departure, Trump went on a social media tirade, demanding that the attorney general, Pam Bondi, move swiftly to prosecute his perceived foes. “They’re all guilty as hell,” Trump wrote of Comey and James in a <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115239044548033727" data-sf-ec-immutable="">Sept. 20 Truth Social post</a>—which, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-doj-inside-political-enemies-17f13f72?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqcfTHPLdgzc-PAS8WDsHnRql46_qbUhtVoQI_2jHzEAnNx7-HjZ-vcW9AKaI4Y%3D&amp;gaa_ts=68f5867a&amp;gaa_sig=l3iUZaUHTpvyS-LcsEihIdrkS6SCC3U5smjqlzOwEFzBi90n3wQPvHgRcDULXJnNdDGaZo4ABNjlgf8JcXAV7w%3D%3D" data-sf-ec-immutable="">according to the Wall Street Journal</a>, may have been intended as a private message. “JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!”<br></p><p>By the following Monday morning, Trump had installed a new top prosecutor in the Eastern District of Virginia: Halligan, his former personal attorney, who until now had never prosecuted a case. Despite her lack of prosecutorial experience—and reportedly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/27/us/politics/trump-comey-justice-department.html" data-sf-ec-immutable="">against the urging</a> of veteran prosecutors in her office—Halligan pressed forward. Within days of her arrival, she secured an <a href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/former-fbi-director-james-comey-indicted" data-sf-ec-immutable="">indictment against Comey</a> for false statements to Congress and obstruction. Two weeks after that, she persuaded a separate grand jury to <a href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/ny-attorney-general-letitia-james-indicted-in-eastern-district-of-virginia" data-sf-ec-immutable="">indict James for mortgage fraud</a>.<br></p><p>This is around when I entered the picture—on Saturday, Oct. 11.<br></p><p>Until she texted me, I’d spent much of that morning catching up on news stories about the case Halligan brought against James, which had just been handed up on Thursday, Oct. 9.&nbsp; <a href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/the-justice-department-s-dangerously-weak-case-against-letitia-james" data-sf-ec-immutable="">The indictment</a> accuses the New York attorney general of misrepresenting how she intended to use a Norfolk, Virginia property when she applied for a loan to purchase it back in 2020.<br></p><p>Specifically, prosecutors say that she told lenders the property would be used as a “second home” when, in reality, she used it as a “rental investment property, renting the property to a family of (3).” By misrepresenting the purpose of the property, the indictment alleges, James was able to obtain a more favorable mortgage rate.&nbsp;<br></p><p>While many <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-lede/the-indictment-of-letitia-james-and-the-collapse-of-impartial-justice" data-sf-ec-immutable="">commentators</a> ridiculed the case, <a href="https://x.com/RogerJStoneJr/status/1970164891265778057" data-sf-ec-immutable="">a </a><a href="https://x.com/RogerJStoneJr/status/1970164891265778057" data-sf-ec-immutable="">few</a> were quick to proclaim that Halligan had an <a href="https://x.com/HansMahncke/status/1976405182092136675" data-sf-ec-immutable="">“airtight”</a> case against James.<br></p><p>I was decidedly <a href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/the-justice-department-s-dangerously-weak-case-against-letitia-james" data-sf-ec-immutable="">among the skeptics</a>. Putting aside the apparently retaliatory nature of the charges, it wasn’t clear to me that the facts alleged in <a href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/ny-attorney-general-letitia-james-indicted-in-eastern-district-of-virginia" data-sf-ec-immutable="">the indictment</a> amounted to a crime at all. The mortgage agreement James signed, which used standard Fannie Mae language, required her to treat the property as a “second home,” mandating that she keep it “available” for her personal use. The agreement explicitly <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/second-home-rider-rewrite-11555599871?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqcUT8LvIU2CXmeDCoIMsludAJmjr5issT4tfkgias5sFkphmFK88OqBU7bdpYI%3D&amp;gaa_ts=68f2ab4b&amp;gaa_sig=azS6fiwCJVPkqbgw8qwqhY-r0TwcXalD5-U0w2DxFeykdbxDzOkFjzkILYm3LToufUtoVji9kLdpb3tPriUGNA%3D%3D" data-sf-ec-immutable="">allowed James to rent</a> the home after one year of ownership, and it <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/second-home-rider-rewrite-11555599871?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqcUT8LvIU2CXmeDCoIMsludAJmjr5issT4tfkgias5sFkphmFK88OqBU7bdpYI%3D&amp;gaa_ts=68f2ab4b&amp;gaa_sig=azS6fiwCJVPkqbgw8qwqhY-r0TwcXalD5-U0w2DxFeykdbxDzOkFjzkILYm3LToufUtoVji9kLdpb3tPriUGNA%3D%3D" data-sf-ec-immutable="">allowed occasional renting</a> within the first year.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Though <a href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/ny-attorney-general-letitia-james-indicted-in-eastern-district-of-virginia" data-sf-ec-immutable="">the indictment</a> notes that James declared “thousand(s)” of dollars in rent on “tax form(s),” it provides scant details about the circumstances of the supposed rental arrangement, including the timing and amount collected.&nbsp; Without knowing those details, I found it difficult to assess whether James had even violated the mortgage contract—much less whether she’d committed a crime by fraudulently entering into it or making false statements on her application intending to deceive anyone.<br></p><p>All of which is why, last Saturday, I took particular interest in a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/11/us/politics/letitia-james-indictment-house.html" data-sf-ec-immutable="">New York Times story</a> about the Norfolk home at the center of the James case. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/11/us/politics/letitia-james-indictment-house.html" data-sf-ec-immutable="">The report</a> revealed that the property is occupied by James’s grand-niece, Nakia Thompson. Several times a year, the report said, James stays at the property with Thompson and her children, who have lived there since James purchased the home in 2020.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/11/us/politics/letitia-james-indictment-house.html" data-sf-ec-immutable="">further reported</a> that Thompson appeared before a Norfolk grand jury in June, testifying that “she had lived in the house for years and that she did not pay rent.” According to the report, Thompson was not asked to testify again, and the grand jury that voted to indict James was seated in Alexandria rather than Norfolk.&nbsp;</p><p>As I saw it, the Times report tended to undermine the indictment’s central claim: that James used the home as a “rental investment property.” The evidence, assuming the Times report is accurate, would be exculpatory, I reasoned, in that it tends to show that James did not primarily use the property as a means to collect rent.<br></p><p>I decided to share the article on X, formerly Twitter, as I often do when notable developments arise in relation to the legal cases I cover for<em> Lawfare</em>. Shortly after noon, I tapped out <a href="https://x.com/AnnaBower/status/1977046307970895925" data-sf-ec-immutable="">a post</a>, linking to the Times article and summarizing it as follows:</p><blockquote>NYT reports that Letitia James’s great niece lives in the home that is the subject of the indictment. The niece reportedly testified before a *different* grand jury, telling them that she had lived there for many years without paying rent. James visits regularly.”<br></blockquote><p>I included <a href="https://x.com/AnnaBower/status/1977046307970895925" data-sf-ec-immutable="">two screenshots</a> from the story, one of which highlighted this quotation: “Ms. Thompson testified to a grand jury in Norfolk that she had lived in the house for years and that she did not pay rent.”</p><p><img src="https://lawfare-assets-new.azureedge.net/assets/images/default-source/article-images/screenshot-2025-10-20-at-5-25-44-pm.png?sfvrsn=7447e92c_3" alt="" sf-size="100"></p><p>Not long after that, at 12:48 p.m., I followed up with a <a href="https://x.com/AnnaBower/status/1977053748511097105" data-sf-ec-immutable="">second observation</a>: “This is important exculpatory evidence bc the indictment accuses James of seeking a ‘second home’ mortgage when in reality she intended to use it as an ‘investment’ home by renting it.”</p><p><img src="https://lawfare-assets-new.azureedge.net/assets/images/default-source/article-images/screenshot-2025-10-20-at-5-27-50-pm.png?sfvrsn=34af51be_3" alt="" sf-size="100"></p><p>I didn’t think much of the tweets at the time. Sharing other journalists’ reporting is a routine part of how I try to keep people apprised of the cases I follow.<br></p><p>But the prosecutor who <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/10/politics/lindsey-halligan-no-coordinate-letitia-james-indictment-doj" data-sf-ec-immutable="">personally presented</a> James’s case to the grand jury apparently saw my tweets very differently.<br></p><p><strong>***</strong></p><p>When I received the 1:20 p.m. connection request on Signal—an encrypted messaging service that many journalists use to communicate with sources—my first reaction was that the user identified as “Lindsey Halligan” couldn’t actually be Halligan.<br></p><p>“Anna, Lindsey Halligan here,” the first message read. “You are reporting things that are simply not true. Thought you should have a heads up.”<br></p><p>The user on the other end had selected a setting to make all messages in the chat disappear after eight hours, so I took screenshots of the exchange as it happened to make sure a record of the back-and-forth was preserved. Those <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26190909-signal-screenshots/" data-sf-ec-immutable="">screenshots are all available </a><a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26190909-signal-screenshots/" data-sf-ec-immutable="">here</a>.<br></p><p>Even as I took this precaution, I assumed the exchange was a hoax because, while it is not unusual for lawyers to reach out to me about my reporting or commentary, it is highly unusual for a U.S. attorney to do so regarding an ongoing prosecution—particularly in a high-profile case in which her conduct is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbKHyNhaaCM" data-sf-ec-immutable="">already the subject</a> of <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/lindsey-halligan-is-already-making-mistakes-prosecuting-james-comey-10799728" data-sf-ec-immutable="">immense public scrutiny</a>. Halligan has publicly said little about the cases she is pursuing against the president’s enemies. And I didn’t believe she would message me to complain about a tweet that merely summarized other journalistic coverage of grand jury testimony.<br></p><p>With all that in mind, I hypothesized that the message was from someone impersonating Halligan, either to troll me or as a part of some kind of disinformation campaign.&nbsp;<br></p><p>But there was an easy way to validate my correspondent’s claim to be Halligan. I’d met Halligan once before, a few years ago in West Palm Beach, Florida. At the time, the Justice Department was investigating Trump’s unlawful retention of classified materials and the FBI had executed a search at Mar-a-Lago. Halligan was one of the former and future president’s personal lawyers litigating over the search and the handling of seized materials.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Our meeting was happenstance: I ran into her and another Trump lawyer, James Trusty, at a restaurant inside The Breakers hotel, where I dined after <a href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/mar-lago-showdown-federal-court" data-sf-ec-immutable="">covering a hearing</a> before Judge Aileen Cannon for<em> Lawfare</em>. When I introduced myself to the pair, they’d made no secret of their dissatisfaction with how I’d characterized <a href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/mar-lago-showdown-federal-court" data-sf-ec-immutable="">Trusty’s presentation</a> during the hearing—particularly, my use of verbs like “gripe” and “complain” to describe his arguments to the judge.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The Guardian would <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/01/trump-lawyers-resign-criminal-investigation" data-sf-ec-immutable="">later report</a> that Trusty had been overheard telling Halligan that he had no interest in talking to reporters from <em>Lawfare</em> on account of <a href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/projects-series/archived-projects/the-trump-trials">our coverage</a>. Still, my conversation with them that evening was otherwise pleasant enough. And I suspected that the real Halligan would remember me.<br></p><p>So I accepted the Signal request and typed out a response, explaining that I needed some additional details to confirm her identity. “Can you tell me where we first met, and who you were with?” I asked.<br></p><p>The person purporting to be “Lindsey Halligan” responded one minute later: “Breakers; Trusty. Got your name from your X account.”<br></p><p>This changed things. I had never spoken publicly about my run-in with Halligan and Trusty at The Breakers. So it seemed exceedingly unlikely that a Halligan impersonator would be able to accurately answer the question, let alone within one minute.<br></p><p>As improbable as it had seemed just minutes ago, it now appeared that I really was texting with interim U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Later in the week, I verified that the text exchange had genuinely been with Halligan—or, at least, with Halligan’s phone. I obtained her cell phone number from an independent source and added the number as a contact on my phone. Signal immediately associated the phone number with the “Lindsey Halligan” account with which I had been texting.&nbsp;<br></p><p>But that was later. For now, I was pretty sure my correspondent was Halligan. So I did what any reporter would do: I started asking questions.<br></p><p>“Ok, I’m all ears,” I said after thanking her. “What am I getting wrong?”<br></p><p>“Honestly, so much,” Halligan replied. “I can’t tell you everything but your reporting in particular is just way off.” She then said it was clear to her that I jump to “biased conclusions” based on what I read rather than “truly looking into the evidence.”<br></p><p>I felt confident that Halligan was alluding to one of the tweets I’d posted that afternoon. Other than the tweets, I hadn’t published anything of substance about the James case; my colleague, Molly Roberts, has been <a href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/the-justice-department-s-dangerously-weak-case-against-letitia-james" data-sf-ec-immutable="">running</a><a href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/the-justice-department-s-dangerously-weak-case-against-letitia-james" data-sf-ec-immutable=""> point</a> on that matter for <em>Lawfare</em>.&nbsp; What’s more, Halligan had mentioned that she found my Signal contact on my X profile, suggesting that she had been looking at my tweets.<br></p><p>To confirm, I sent Halligan a link to <a href="https://x.com/AnnaBower/status/1977046307970895925" data-sf-ec-immutable="">the post</a> in which I summarized Thompson’s grand jury testimony <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/11/us/politics/letitia-james-indictment-house.html" data-sf-ec-immutable="">as reported by</a> the Times. “Are you saying that something I said in this post is inaccurate?” I asked. “And if so, what?”<br></p><p>Halligan replied: “You’re assuming exculpatory evidence without knowing what you’re talking about. It’s just bizarre to me. If you have any questions, before you report, feel free to reach out to me. But jumping to conclusions does your credibility no good.”&nbsp;</p><p>Halligan’s real beef seemed to be with the Times, not me, though she wasn’t saying what was wrong with the Times’s story either. I brought this up in my response, pointing out that my post explicitly credited <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/11/us/politics/letitia-james-indictment-house.html" data-sf-ec-immutable="">the Times story</a>, not my own reporting. “Did they get something wrong?” I asked.<br></p><p>“Yes they did but you went with it!” she said. “Without even fact checking anything!!!!”&nbsp;</p><p>Then she added this: “And they are disclosing grand jury info - which is also not a full representation of what happened. I guess I expect them to do that but I was surprised by you running with it.”<br></p><p>Note that there is nothing improper about the New York Times disclosing grand jury information. The rules of grand jury secrecy, codified in <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcrmp/rule_6" data-sf-ec-immutable="">Rule 6(e) of t</a><a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcrmp/rule_6" data-sf-ec-immutable="">he Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure</a>, don’t apply to the press. And they don’t bind defense attorneys or witnesses either. So if, say, Thompson or her lawyers had dished to the New York Times about her testimony and the Times had reported about her account, nobody would be violating any rule.<br></p><p>On the other hand, it is <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcrmp/rule_6" data-sf-ec-immutable="">generally improper</a> for prosecutors to disclose matters that took place before a grand jury. Rule 6(e) very explicitly covers “an attorney for the government,” and it very specifically prohibits those it covers—subject to certain exceptions—from “disclos[ing] a matter occurring before the grand jury.” And the Justice Manual, which serves as the official statement of Justice Department policies, places <a href="https://www.justice.gov/jm/jm-9-11000-grand-jury" data-sf-ec-immutable="">detailed restrictions</a> on prosecutors’ use of matters before the grand jury. The matters reported on by the Times are matters of which Halligan would be intimately aware, as she is <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/10/politics/letitia-james-case-explained" data-sf-ec-immutable="">reported</a> to have personally presented the case to the grand jury.&nbsp;</p><p>Avoiding grand jury secrecy violations is one reason Justice Department officials so <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2017/10/02/robert-mueller-russia-probe-secret-243345" data-sf-ec-immutable="">frequently offer </a><a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2017/10/02/robert-mueller-russia-probe-secret-243345" data-sf-ec-immutable="">“no comment”</a> on ongoing investigations or cases, preferring instead that the department <a href="https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/speech/attorney-general-merrick-b-garland-delivers-opening-statement-senate-judiciary-committee" data-sf-ec-immutable="">“speak through its court filings.</a><a href="https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/speech/attorney-general-merrick-b-garland-delivers-opening-statement-senate-judiciary-committee" data-sf-ec-immutable="">”</a> And that’s why my dialogue with Halligan struck me as so unusual. Reaching out to a reporter to complain about tweets concerning another publication’s coverage of grand jury testimony seemed uncharacteristically risky for a government lawyer.<br></p><p>I told Halligan that I’d be happy to retract or correct anything I had tweeted that was untrue. “But I can’t do that if I don’t know what the supposed error is,” I said. “Can you be more specific?”<br></p><p>She directed me to the indictment. “It says she received thousand(s) of dollars in rent,” she said, presumably referring to James. Then she added: “I can’t tell you grand jury stuff.”<br></p><p>At this point, I broadly understood Halligan to be conveying a few things to me.&nbsp; The first is that the Times story did indeed disclose grand jury information, but that she believed some part of its account was either inaccurate or misleading or lacked the full context of what occurred. Though she hadn’t explicitly said <em>what</em> grand jury information the Times had disclosed, I interpreted the focus of her ire to be the paper’s account of Thompson’s testimony, which I’d summarized in my tweet.<br></p><p>The second point is that Halligan seemed to be responding in some way to the substance of Thompson’s reported testimony—specifically, that she did not pay rent—by directing me to the indictment, which alleged that James reported “thousand(s)” of dollars in rental income on “tax form(s).”<br></p><p>This did not seem to me to be much of a conflict. I had interpreted the Times to be saying that Thompson was not <em>currently</em> paying rent and had gone for years without doing so, not that she had <em>never</em> paid any rent at any point.<br></p><p>The indictment’s wording on this point is odd and ambiguous. It conspicuously omits the timing and the amount of money in rental income James supposedly reported on her “tax form(s).” And, while the “tax form(s)” are not publicly available, James’s state ethics disclosures are.<br></p><p><a href="https://whitecollarfraud.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2018-to-2023-Letitia-James-Financial-Disclosures.pdf" data-sf-ec-immutable="">Those disclosures report</a> rental income on the Norfolk property only once, back in 2020, for a sum of between $1,000 and $5,000. That James might have collected a relatively small sum of rental income at some point half a decade ago does not contradict the idea that Thompson has lived there for years without paying rent. Nor does it show that James violated her mortgage agreement, given that the contract <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/second-home-rider-rewrite-11555599871?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqdYiN0zOEWG_ZmXuGCu-GNKwV6h7TzaVn-erMKvObNnWA-xJFXhbN2Hg3-tVtc%3D&amp;gaa_ts=68f67b82&amp;gaa_sig=UFQK17cjRwHmmxL76ytAQ1iOgcGHrbi-djFnm7QlRklZPyVT0P8ss7U4l_T-XXGvD3vEgpiWtkpv3DNdKldNNQ%3D%3D" data-sf-ec-immutable="">allowed occasional rentals</a>, even during the first year.</p><p>To be sure, it’s possible that the evidence at trial will show otherwise. But the indictment Halligan had filed, coupled with the publicly available facts, don’t promise that it will. And the specific allegation she’d pointed me to did not on its face contradict the testimony I’d summarized in my tweet.&nbsp;</p><p>Beyond that, though, I still couldn’t understand precisely <em>what </em>Halligan was trying to tell me. Was she suggesting that Thompson had lied to the grand jury? Or that the Times had mischaracterized Thompson’s testimony? Or something else entirely?<br></p><p>I explained my thinking to Halligan in my next response, writing as follows:</p><blockquote>I read the NY Times report as saying that Nakia testified that she lived in the house for years without paying rent. Though the indictment says there were thousands of dollars of rent paid *at one point,* I don’t see that as inconsistent with her testimony as reported by the NY Times. James’s ethics disclosures report between $1,000-$5,000 in rent back in 2020. But after that, she didn’t disclose additional rental income. I’m still not sure I understand what’s incorrect about the NY Times account or my summary of it.<br></blockquote><p>Halligan replied:</p><blockquote><p>Anna,</p><p>You’re biased. Your reporting isn’t accurate. I’m the one handling the case and I’m telling you that. If you want to twist and torture the facts to fit your narrative, there’s nothing I can do. Waste to even give you a heads up.<br></p></blockquote><p>In turn, I reminded Halligan that it was she who had approached me to tell me that I’d compounded or repeated something inaccurate in the Times’s account of Thompson’s testimony. “I am happy to correct it, but I can’t do so without a sense of what I supposedly got wrong,” I said.<br></p><p>“Continue to do what you have been and you’ll be completely discredited when the evidence comes out,” she replied.</p><p>I still wasn’t sure what I’d supposedly gotten wrong, or why she’d contacted me, or what to make of it all.</p><p>And for what it’s worth, the Times doesn’t know either. In a statement to <em>Lawfare</em>, the paper said that the Justice Department had raised no issue with the Times about its story: “We’re confident in the accuracy of our reporting. The DOJ declined to comment before publication and has not raised any concerns with us since the story was published more than a week ago.”</p><p>It was clear that Halligan and I had reached a point of diminishing returns.</p><p>“I’d love to talk further when you are at liberty to be specific,” I said.</p><p>And we left it there—at least for a few hours.</p><p><strong>***</strong></p><p>Later that evening, I followed up with Halligan. She’d seemed frustrated by the end of our conversation that afternoon. But she’d also told me that I could “feel free” to reach out to her if I had any questions. And I wanted to find out if she was serious about that.<br></p><p>“I’m curious for your thoughts more broadly,” I wrote at 9:19 p.m. on Saturday. “What are you most frustrated that reporters aren’t focusing on or writing about with respect to this case?”<br></p><p>“No frustration generally,” she replied. “You’re the only reporter I reached out to.”<br></p><p>The next day, I tried again. I asked if I should expect additional charges against James, as <a href="https://www.wsj.com/us-news/law/trumps-favored-prosecutor-is-moving-at-full-steam-8b3cdecb?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqdHnHePvJ-PT4MBAvwmJkH923hWWmBtw12kyV8tZglO8BT9Ic6LhUnXCe72q1c%3D&amp;gaa_ts=68f2af08&amp;gaa_sig=_EIG6DY_NytNy0l-whyS6zFJbDSawqC9W_bnxH1Ljrvo5WIQjD6PWVblfMOaR-NGqAsiAX7RNhHINQCOmY9lyg%3D%3D" data-sf-ec-immutable="">the </a><a href="https://www.wsj.com/us-news/law/trumps-favored-prosecutor-is-moving-at-full-steam-8b3cdecb?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqdHnHePvJ-PT4MBAvwmJkH923hWWmBtw12kyV8tZglO8BT9Ic6LhUnXCe72q1c%3D&amp;gaa_ts=68f2af08&amp;gaa_sig=_EIG6DY_NytNy0l-whyS6zFJbDSawqC9W_bnxH1Ljrvo5WIQjD6PWVblfMOaR-NGqAsiAX7RNhHINQCOmY9lyg%3D%3D" data-sf-ec-immutable="">Wall Street Journal</a> had reported over the weekend.<br></p><p>“You don’t report fairly!” Halligan replied. Then she added: “I can’t discuss any potential charges with reporters. If evidence arises that warrants further charges, I’ll look into it!”<br></p><p>I was genuinely confused. Only the previous day, she had essentially invited me to fact-check other outlets’ reporting before tweeting about them. Now she was refusing to engage when I did exactly that. “I thought you said I was welcome to reach out to you about what other outlets are reporting,” I said.<br></p><p>She wrote back: “Why do you report on what other outlets are reporting? If I was you, I’d develop sources myself and out compete them all!”<br></p><p>I expressed my confusion in my next message: “What was the purpose of reaching out to me, if not to open a line of communication? Was it just to insult my reporting?”<br></p><p>“No, it was for you to correct it, which you refused to do,” she replied.<br></p><p>We’d come full circle, back to my tweet summarizing the Times article. Something about it had seemed to strike a nerve with Halligan, but I couldn’t figure out exactly what or why.<br></p><p>“I am more than happy to correct it, but you still haven’t told me what’s incorrect!” I said. “What precisely is wrong with the tweet?”<br></p><p>Halligan didn’t respond.<br></p><p>Over the next several days, I followed up twice more, asking Halligan for her perspective on a variety of questions I had about the James case. My texts went unanswered.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>***</strong><br></p><p>Halligan had said quite a lot during our correspondence, although much of it was hard for me to parse. But there was an important thing she had <em>not</em> said during the entirety of our communications: “Off the record” or “On background” or anything whatsoever about the terms on which we were talking.&nbsp;</p><p>As anyone who professionally engages with the media as routinely as Halligan would know, the default assumption when a reporter speaks with a public official is that everything is “on the record,” meaning that anything the source says can be printed with attribution. If the source wishes to speak confidentially, she can negotiate how the information will be used. “On background” means that the information the source provides to a journalist can be published, so long as the journalist doesn’t reveal the source’s name or identifying information. “Off the record” means the reporter can’t print what the source tells them at all. There are other variations too. But with any condition, a fundamental premise is that the reporter must <em>agree </em>to speak on that basis.<br></p><p>In the course of my work as a journalist, I frequently agree to speak with sources on background or off the record. I take my duty of confidentiality seriously and I have never burned a source by revealing confidential communications.<br></p><p>I certainly would have been willing to speak with Halligan on background or off the record. But she never raised the terms on which we were speaking at any point during the two days in which we exchanged texts.&nbsp;<br></p><p>After Saturday evening’s message, she went radio silent. By the end of the week, this much was clear: U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan was ghosting me.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>***</strong><br></p><p>Even now, I remain mystified by Halligan’s texts to me. She is currently the most scrutinized prosecutor in the country, widely seen as hand-picked to prosecute her boss’s political enemies.&nbsp; Even the slightest misstep could be seized on and picked apart by defense counsel representing James, who <a href="https://transcripts.cnn.com/show/cnc/date/2025-10-14/segment/03" data-sf-ec-immutable="">analysts expect</a> will<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2025/10/15/letitia-james-indictment-defense-interview-00607888" data-sf-ec-immutable=""> seek dismissal</a> of her charges based on selective or vindictive prosecution.<br></p><p>It’s not as if Halligan didn’t understand the rules of engagement with the press. For years, she worked as a member of Trump’s criminal defense team, which routinely courted media attention, despite <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/08/us/politics/trumps-lawyers-jack-smith-justice-department.html" data-sf-ec-immutable="">accusing</a><a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/08/us/politics/trumps-lawyers-jack-smith-justice-department.html&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1760992934198748&amp;usg=AOvVaw3nRuG0WRHhDM_2ia4jaIKA" data-sf-ec-immutable=""> prosecutors</a> of improper leaks. And now, as a prosecutor herself, she has accused former FBI director Comey of lying about whether he authorized a colleague at the bureau to serve as an anonymous source in news reports about an ongoing investigation. A central issue in that case, which Halligan reportedly also <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/26/politics/james-comey-indictment-trump-prosecution" data-sf-ec-immutable="">presented to the grand jury herself</a>, concerns the nature of interactions between reporters and federal law enforcement sources.<br></p><p>So the irony was hard to ignore when, just days after she texted me, Halligan <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/17/politics/lindsey-halligan-ousts-more-prosecutors-eastern-district-virginia" data-sf-ec-immutable="">reportedly fired</a> two senior career prosecutors for supposedly “leaking ‘unauthorized’ information to the press.” That same week, she released a statement in response to <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/news/trumps-doj-punitive-firings-public-scoldings-pressure-prosecute-foes-rcna237622" data-sf-ec-immutable="">an MSNBC story</a> about a separate case against a Democratic state lawmaker. “EDVA enforces a strict zero-tolerance policy on the unauthorized disclosure of information concerning ongoing investigations or cases,” she said. In the same story, Justice Department spokesman Chad Gilmartin is quoted saying: “While we do not confirm the existence of, nor comment on, specific investigations outside of our public filings, any Department employee who leaks deliberative or investigative developments only jeopardizes the integrity of investigations and the incredible work of federal law enforcement.”&nbsp;</p><p>For someone so attuned to the risks of speaking out of turn—and so willing to punish others for allegedly doing so—Halligan’s decision to reach out to me over text remains baffling.<br></p><p>She knew I was a journalist. She approached me. She invited my questions. She even encouraged me to stop chasing other reporters’ stories and focus on my own.<br></p><p>Turns out, she gave me a great one.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>Epilogue</em></strong><br></p><p>Earlier today, I reached out to the Justice Department’s Office of Public Affairs, seeking comment for this story. In addition to a transcript of my Signal exchange with Halligan, I also outlined some of my questions related to the story: Were these authorized communications? Is it consistent with DOJ policy or other applicable guidance for senior Justice Department officials to discuss ongoing prosecutions on Signal disappearing messages? Does the Department take the position that the contents of the messages are consistent with its legal obligations and DOJ policy? Does Halligan deny that these were in fact her texts? Does the Justice Department dispute any of the facts reported in the New York Times article discussed in my exchange with Halligan?<br></p><p>I told the Justice Department that my deadline was 4:15 p.m.<br></p><p>In response, the department sent the statement quoted at the outset of this piece. In addition, just a few minutes before the deadline, my dormant Signal connection with Halligan suddenly came alive again.<br></p><p>At 4:10 p.m., she texted me: “By the way—everything I ever sent you is off record. You’re not a journalist so it’s weird saying that but just letting you know.”<br></p><p>I responded: “I’m sorry, but that’s not how this works. You don’t get to say that in retrospect.”<br></p><p>Halligan was unpersuaded: “Yes I do. Off record.”&nbsp;</p><p>“I am really sorry. I would have been happy to speak with you on an off the record basis had you asked,” I said. “But you didn’t ask, and I still haven’t agreed to speak on that basis. Do you have any further comment for the story?&nbsp;</p><p>To my surprise, she kept going: “It’s obvious the whole convo is off record. There’s disappearing messages and it’s on signal. What is your story? You never told me about a story.”<br></p><p>I didn’t respond. It was time to publish my story. I’ll text it to her.<em></em><br></p><p><em>Postscript: Read </em><a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26190909-signal-screenshots/" data-sf-ec-immutable=""><em>the full exchange between </em></a><a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26190909-signal-screenshots/" data-sf-ec-immutable=""><em>Lindsey Halligan and </em>Lawfare’<em>s Anna Bower here</em></a><em>.</em><br></p>

        <h2>Magit Is Amazing!</h2>
        <p>
            I was reading a post about Jujutsu version control system the other day and that just made me realize how awesome is Magit!

        <p>I’ve been hearing a lot about <a href="https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jujutsu</a>
 VCS lately, and when I say a lot I mean maybe 5 times this year. But that is a lot for a new VCS I would say.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.stavros.io/posts/switch-to-jujutsu-already-a-tutorial/?utm_source=changelog-news" target="_blank" rel="noopener">article</a>
 I came across mostly goes through the flexibility of Jujutsu VCS over <a href="https://git-scm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Git</a>
, or at least that’s as far as I managed to read before I lost interest. I was thinking “<em>you can easily do this using Git???</em>”, but then I realized that I’ve actually never used Git for almost anything besides cloning repositories… I’ve always been using <a href="https://magit.vc/" title="Magit! 🪄" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Magit</a>
 for almost everything.</p>
<p>Sometimes I think whether it would have been better if I started using Git CLI and then switched to Magit, that way I would really understand why it’s called that way, rather than taking all the amazing work behind it for granted. But I think afterall I wouldn’t have discovered Git commands so early in my career if I had just used the Git CLI from the start. I remember I was stashing my code changes back in my early career while other coworkers were struggling to move to another branch without losing their changes.</p>
<p>I’m pretty sure this isn’t all what Jujutsu is about, but now I really don’t feel like giving it a try anytime soon because of that article.</p>
