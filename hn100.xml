<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Microsoft is laying off 1,900 employees at Activision Blizzard and Xbox this week. While Microsoft is primarily laying off roles at Activision Blizzard, some Xbox and ZeniMax employees will also be impacted by the cuts.</p><p>The cuts work out to roughly 8 percent of the overall Microsoft Gaming division that stands at around 22,000 employees in total. <em>The Verge</em> has obtained an internal memo from Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer that confirms the layoffs:</p><div><blockquote><p>It’s been a little over three months since the Activision, Blizzard, and King teams joined Microsoft. As we move forward in 2024, the leadership of Microsoft Gaming and Activision Blizzard is committed to aligning on a strategy and an execution plan with a sustainable cost structure that will support the whole of our growing business.&nbsp;Together, we’ve set priorities, identified areas of overlap, and ensured that we’re all aligned on the best opportunities for growth.</p><p>As part of this process,&nbsp;we have made the painful decision&nbsp;to reduce&nbsp;the size of our gaming workforce by approximately&nbsp;1900 roles out of the 22,000 people on our team.&nbsp;The Gaming Leadership Team and I are committed to navigating this process as thoughtfully as possible. The people who are directly impacted by these reductions have all played an important part in the success of Activision Blizzard, ZeniMax and the Xbox teams, and they should be proud of everything they’ve accomplished here. We are grateful for all of the creativity, passion and dedication they have brought to our games, our players and our colleagues. We will provide our full support to those who are impacted during the transition, including severance benefits informed by local employment laws. Those whose roles will be impacted will be notified, and we ask that you please treat your departing colleagues with the respect and compassion that is consistent with our values.</p><p>Looking ahead, we’ll continue to invest in areas that will grow our business and support our strategy of bringing more games to more players around the world. Although this is a difficult moment for our team, I’m as confident as ever in your ability to create and nurture the games, stories and worlds that bring players together.</p><p>Phil</p></blockquote></div><p>Alongside the layoffs, Blizzard president Mike Ybarra has decided to leave the company. “As many of you know, Mike previously spent more than 20 years at&nbsp;Microsoft. Now that he has seen the acquisition through as Blizzard’s president, he has decided to leave the company,” says Microsoft’s game content and studios president, Matt Booty, in an internal memo.</p><p>Microsoft plans to name a new Blizzard president next week. Allen Adham, Blizzard’s chief design officer, is also leaving the company. “As one of Blizzard’s cofounders, Allen has had a broad impact on all of Blizzard’s games. His influence will be felt for years to come, both directly and indirectly as Allen plans to continue mentoring young designers across the industry,” says Booty.</p><p>Blizzard’s previously announced survival game has also been canceled as part of these changes. Booty says Microsoft will be “shifting some of the people working on it to one of several promising new projects Blizzard has in the early stages of development.”</p><p>The layoffs come the same month Riot Games, Google, Discord, Twitch, Unity, eBay, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/14/23458204/meta-twitter-amazon-apple-layoffs-hiring-freezes-latest-tech-industry">others announced cuts</a>.</p><p>Microsoft <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/13/23791235/microsoft-activision-blizzard-acquisition-complete-finalized">completed its $68.7 billion acquisition</a> of Activision Blizzard in October, following 20 months of battles with regulators in the UK and US. Former Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/20/24009129/microsoft-gaming-xbox-phil-spencer-bobby-kotick-activision-leadership-changes">stepped down at the end of December</a>, with Microsoft not appointing a direct replacement. Instead, a suite of Activision Blizzard executives now report up to Matt Booty.</p><p>Today’s layoffs come just a few months after some <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/26/23933049/microsoft-reorg-xbox-marketing-ai-leadership-changes">big Xbox leadership changes</a> saw Sarah Bond promoted to Xbox president, leading all Xbox platform and hardware work. Booty was also promoted to president of game content and studios, which includes overseeing Bethesda, ZeniMax studios, and Activision Blizzard.</p><p>Microsoft last announced big layoffs a year ago, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/18/23560315/microsoft-job-cuts-layoffs-2023-tech">affecting 10,000 employees</a>. The software maker is due to report its fiscal Q2 2024 earnings next week, which, for the first time, will include results from the impact of the Activision Blizzard acquisition.</p><p>Here’s Matt Booty’s internal memo in full:</p><div><blockquote><p>Blizzard team,&nbsp;</p><p>As you may have read in Phil’s note, today is a challenging day as we say goodbye to some of our colleagues. This is a difficult process, but it is one that will best enable Blizzard and Xbox to deliver ambitious games for our players on more platforms and in more places than ever before. We are moving forward with a more focused strategy across Microsoft Gaming that sets us up for sustainable growth and aligns our talent and resources to our top priorities.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to the events today, Mike Ybarra and I have been discussing his future and some of his personal passions for some time. As many of you know, Mike previously spent more than 20 years at Microsoft. Now that he has seen the acquisition through as Blizzard’s president, he has decided to leave the company. As we move forward, we will continue to build on the positive momentum that Mike created and strive to continue exceeding the expectations of Blizzard’s players. I want to thank Mike for his leadership and for his partnership and counsel since the deal closed. I know he plans to travel and spend more time with his family. We wish him the very best.</p><p>Additionally, Allen Adham, Blizzard’s Chief Design Officer, is leaving the company. As one of Blizzard’s cofounders, Allen has had a broad impact on all of Blizzard’s games. His influence will be felt for years to come, both directly and indirectly as Allen plans to continue mentoring young designers across the industry.</p><p>The new Blizzard President will be announced next week.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What Happens Next</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Those who are impacted are being informed in meetings starting today. Given the challenging day ahead, anyone who is set up to work from home and would prefer to, can work remotely today. Due to time zones and local holidays, some impacted employees in APAC and EMEA will be informed later this evening and into early next week. After the notifications are complete, leaders will bring their teams together. Please be mindful of this process in your conversations and outreach during these next few days.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Details on Today’s Actions</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>The changes announced today reflect a focus on products and strategies that hold the most promise for Blizzard’s future growth, as well as identified areas of overlap across Blizzard and Microsoft Gaming. Today’s actions affect multiple teams within Blizzard, including development teams, shared service organizations and corporate functions. As part of this focus, Blizzard is ending development on its survival game project and will be shifting some of the people working on it to one of several promising new projects Blizzard has in the early stages of development.&nbsp;</p><p>No matter the reason behind these decisions, they are never made lightly. Changes like these affect the lives of colleagues and friends, and we are all grateful for their meaningful contributions to Blizzard and its world class lineup of games. As Phil stated, we will provide our full support to those who are impacted during the transition, including severance benefits informed by local employment laws.&nbsp;</p><p>I understand that this is a challenging time and that it can be a lot to process. I haven’t met many of you yet, and hearing about these decisions from me may be difficult. Today, I am here on Blizzard’s Irvine campus, and I am personally committed to supporting you as teams and individuals, keeping you informed, and approaching this transition period with care and transparency.&nbsp;</p><p>Thank you for working through these changes with us. Together we will continue to create amazing games for our players, with a culture that empowers everyone to be their most authentic selves and do their best work.&nbsp;</p><p>- Matt&nbsp;</p></blockquote></div><p><em><strong>Update, January 25th 10:45AM ET</strong>: Article updated with full memo from Matt Booty.</em></p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="storywrap-430723">


<h3>from the <i>hollowed-out-and-sold-for-parts</i> dept</h3>

<p>When we last checked in with what’s left of Sports Illustrated, its owner, The Arena Group, had just got done baring its ass as part of a giant <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/11/29/sports-illustrated-the-latest-to-bare-its-entire-ass-thanks-to-laziness-greed-and-half-cooked-ai/">‘AI’ related scandal</a>. Company executives apparently thought it would be a great idea to create a bunch of fake, AI-generated writers to shit out lazy, uninteresting clickbait, without really telling any of the folks that create actual journalism at the company.</p>
<p>When busted, Arena Group executives blamed everyone but themselves. </p>
<p>Sports Illustrated’s fortunes got even bleaker last week, when it was revealed that The Arena Group, which had actually <strong>only been renting the Sports Illustrated brand</strong> as part of a 10-year deal with Authentic Brands Group (ABG), had <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/01/sports-illustrated-brand-publisher-restructuring-1235696747/amp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">failed to make a quarterly $3.75 million</a> payment to continue licensing it. That resulted in a revocation of the branding license and no limit of additional chaos for the already imploding company.</p>
<p>To <a href="https://awfulannouncing.com/si/jamie-salter-manoj-bhargava-abg-arena-sports-illustrated.html">hear ABG CEO Jamie Salter tell it</a>, Arena Group tried to change the terms of the licensing deal and lower its payments mid-stride. Salter says they may still be able to strike a deal with Arena, or they may find another renter. But when it comes to sports reporting and Sports Illustrated, it doesn’t really matter at this point — as the brand has already largely become a zombie of its former self. </p>
<p>And, as is usually the case, employees doing the actual work were the ones who <a href="https://defector.com/sports-illustrated-as-we-know-it-appears-to-be-dead">got to pay the price for their employers’ incompetence</a> and bickering, with large swaths informed of layoffs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Earlier today, The Arena Group gave notice over email that it would be conducting layoffs at&nbsp;Sports Illustrated.&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/si_union/status/1748390846058176659" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A statement from the&nbsp;Sports Illustrated&nbsp;union</a>&nbsp;revealed that “a significant number, possibly all” of the magazine’s staff would be losing their jobs as the result of Authentic Brands Group’s decision to revoke The Arena Group’s license to the&nbsp;SI&nbsp;brand.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Over the past six years Sports Illustrated has been tossed around between a rotating crop of dodgy international middlemen for whom journalism was an afterthought. SI was acquired in 2018 by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dotdash_Meredith#:~:text=On%20October%206%2C%202021%2C%20Dotdash,new%20entity%20called%20Dotdash%20Meredith.">what was left</a> of Meredith Publishing as part of a purchase of what was left of Time, Inc. (which founded the magazine in 1954), then had its intellectual property sold to Authentic for $110 million a year later. </p>
<p>All the while, the output and quality of the end product and brand steadily declined, resulting in a media outlet that’s now more interested in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/7F3704AF-8F81-472D-9CDE-4D543395482D">hawking supplements</a> and affixing its brand to casino deals than doing any sort of cogent sports reporting. It’s a not dissimilar trajectory to other major media brands like Newsweek, which was <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/158968/newsweek-rise-zombie-magazine">hollowed out like a pumpkin and now traffics in right wing conspiracy theories</a>. </p>
<p>Sports Illustrated’s decline runs in parallel to the ongoing, continuing collapse of real journalism and the whole <em>accurately informing the public</em> thing–which has never been much of a money maker. There were a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bradadgate/2023/12/19/media-companies-have-slashed-over-20000-jobs-in-2023/?sh=b6b29c022b78">record number of media layoffs last year,</a> as trust fund brunchlords and the incompetent stewards of a dying press hustle and jockey to make a quick buck shuffling bloated brand corpses around.</p>
<p>It’s more profitable to make a quick buck striking acquisition deals and pointless mergers for the tax breaks — generating automated clickbait and bullshit at historic scale and using what’s left of popular brands to sell junk — than it is to pay real reporters a living wage to create quality journalism. The end result of that lazy mindset is everywhere you look. And it seems to be getting worse.</p>
<p>Despite a lot of lip service, we’ve <em>never really spent a whole lot of time actually trying to find creative new funding options for real journalism</em> at any meaningful scale. Certainly nowhere near the time and effort put into get rich quick tech fads like NFTs. The stewards of what’s left have no interest in real journalism, or funding it. They’re in it to make a quick buck off the fading remnants of a dying industry, cutting corners, firing employees, and pursuing easy money wherever possible.</p>
<p>As a result journalism — sports or otherwise — is steadily being replaced by a parade of automated gibberish, clickbait, <a href="https://www.damemagazine.com/2023/03/06/america-propaganda-disinformation/">well-funded propaganda</a>, and marketing, and it’s getting increasingly difficult to find anybody with the ethics and resources interested in reversing — or even combating — the trajectory. </p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/01/eff-and-more-100-ngos-set-non-negotiable-redlines-ahead-un-cybercrime-treaty">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/01/eff-and-more-100-ngos-set-non-negotiable-redlines-ahead-un-cybercrime-treaty</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39129274">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span>EFF has joined forces with 110 NGOs today in a <a href="https://www.eff.org/files/2024/01/22/joint.advocacy.statement-cybercrime.convention-jan.23.2024.pdf">joint statement</a></span><span> <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/01/joint-statement-proposed-cybercrime-treaty-ahead-concluding-session">delivered to the United Nations</a> Ad Hoc Committee, clearly outlining civil society&nbsp;non-negotiable redlines for the </span><a href="https://www.unodc.org/documents/Cybercrime/AdHocCommittee/Concluding_session/Documents/A_AC.291_22_Rev.1_E.pdf"><span>proposed UN Cybercrime Treaty</span></a><span>, and asserting that states should reject the proposed treaty if these essential changes are not implemented.&nbsp;</span><br><span></span></p>
<p><span>The last draft published on November 6, 2023 does not adequately ensure adherence to human rights law and standards. Initially focused on cybercrime, the proposed Treaty <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/cybersecurity/opinion/un-cybercrime-treaty-a-menace-in-the-making/">has alarmingly evolved</a> into an expansive surveillance tool.</span></p>
<p><span>Katitza Rodriguez, EFF Policy Director for Global Privacy,&nbsp;asserts ahead of the upcoming concluding negotiations:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span>The proposed treaty needs more than just minor adjustments; it requires a more focused, narrowly defined approach to tackle cybercrime. This change is essential to prevent the treaty from becoming a global surveillance pact rather than a tool for effectively combating core cybercrimes. With its wide-reaching scope and invasive surveillance powers, the current version raises serious concerns about cross-border repression and potential police overreach. Above all, human rights must be the treaty's cornerstone, not an afterthought. If states can't unite on these key points, they must outright reject the treaty.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span>Historically, cybercrime legislation has been exploited to target journalists and security researchers, suppress dissent and whistleblowers, endanger human rights defenders, limit free expression, and justify unnecessary and disproportionate state surveillance measures. We are concerned that the proposed Treaty, as it stands now, will exacerbate these problems. The proposed treaty <a href="https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/cybercrime/ad_hoc_committee/ahc_concluding_session/main">concluding session</a> will be held at the UN Headquarters in New York from January 29 to February 10th. EFF will be attending in person.</span></p>
<p><span>The <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/01/joint-statement-proposed-cybercrime-treaty-ahead-concluding-session">joint statement</a> specifically calls States to narrow the scope of criminalization provisions to well defined cyber dependent crimes; shield security researchers, whistleblowers, activists, and journalists from being&nbsp;prosecuted for their legitimate activities; explicitly include language on international human rights law, data protection, and gender mainstreaming; limit the scope of the domestic criminal procedural measures and international cooperation to core cybercrimes established in the criminalization chapter; and address concerns that the current draft could weaken cybersecurity and encryption. Additionally, it requires the necessity to establish specific safeguards, such as the principles of prior judicial authorization, necessity, legitimate aim, and proportionality. </span></p>

<p>In the aftermath of <a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2237527/epic-games-selling-bandcamp-a-year-after-acquiring-it/news/">Epic selling Bandcamp to Songtradr</a>, Bandcamp has found itself in a place of instability. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/16/23919551/bandcamp-layoffs-epic-songtradr">Half of the company’s employees were laid off</a> post-acquisition, leading many to speculate over the beloved platform’s future. Most importantly, many artists who depended on the service are left looking for alternatives.</p>



<p>There isn’t a Fediverse solution yet. Although <a href="https://funkwhale.audio/">Funkwhale</a> is a great music platform, it’s just not geared towards selling music. Not all is lost, however, as the <a href="https://simonrepp.com/faircamp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Faircamp</a> project is stepping in to help musicians.</p>

<p>Faircamp bills itself as “a static site generator for audio producers”, but an easier way to understand it is this: it’s a simple site that you can host yourself. Install some software on your server, point it at the folder of the music you want to sell, and your site’s pages will build themselves. You can find a great guide for getting started <a href="https://www.meljoann.com/posts/faircamp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>

<p>Faircamp offers a high degree of customization, all while looking good doing it. Artists are able to set up payment for albums and tracks, offer freebies, unlock codes, and embed a player in other sites. It looks great on mobile, too.</p>





<p>So far, the music community has responded to Faircamp very positively. Many musicians within the Fediverse have actively made an effort to form <a href="https://webring.key13.uk/">an old-school webring</a>, in the hopes of supporting one another.</p>

<p>More notably, Radio Free Fedi has been incredibly proactive, <a href="https://faircamp.radiofreefedi.net/">offering a free service</a> to help Fedi musicians host their own Faircamp sites on RadioFreeFedi’s infrastructure.</p>



<figure><blockquote><div><p>With the recent sale of Bandcamp to predatory VC extractive vultures, and the main move to finalise that sale was to fire all the recently unionised staff, the writing is on the wall for the last least worst option…</p><p>…here is an option for members of our community who may not want or be able to self-host their music and/or would like something that is a simple, tidy, open and not walled garden or metrics driven home to offer their music to supporters.</p></div><cite><a href="https://faircamp.radiofreefedi.net/">Radio Free FedI</a></cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Embeds still look a little janky on mobile, but they could probably get cleaned up by submitting a simple pull request on the <a href="https://codeberg.org/simonrepp/faircamp">project’s Codeberg repository</a>.</p>







<p>All in all, Faircamp looks like it’s shaping up to be a great alternative method for supporting Fediverse musicians! Hopefully this effort brings renewed interest towards building federated tools for creatives on the network, somewhere down the road.</p>

<p>Have you ever shoved a <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> into a <code>&lt;marquee&gt;</code> tag? Pixar gets all the
accolades today, but in the 90s this was a serious feat of computer animation.
By combining these two tags, you were a trailblazer. A person capable of great
innovation. A human being that all other human beings could aspire to.</p>

<p>You were a web developer in the 1990s.</p>

<p>With that status, you knew you were hot shit. And you brought with you a score
of the most fearsome technological innovations, the likes of which we haven’t
come close to replicating ever since.</p>

<p>Put down the jQuery, step away from the non-relational database: we have more
important things to talk about.</p>

<h2 id="1x1gif">1x1.gif</h2>

<p>1x1.gif should have won a fucking Grammy. Or a Pulitzer. Or <em>Most Improved,
Third Grade Gym Class</em> or something. It’s the most important achievement in
computer science since the linked list. It’s not the future we deserved, but
it’s the future we needed (until the box model fucked it all up).</p>

<p>If you’re not familiar with the humble 1x1.gif trick, here it is:</p>

<!-- lol yeah i'm base64 encoding 1x1.gif isn't that fucking dope? -->
<p><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>

<p>Can’t see it? Here, <em>enhance</em>:</p>

<p><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="100" width="100%"></p>

<p>The 1x1.gif — or spacer.gif, or transparent.gif — is just a one pixel by one
pixel transparent GIF. Just like the most futuristic CSS framework of today <em>but
in a billionth of the file size</em>, 1x1.gif is fully optimized for the
<strong>responsive web</strong>. You had to use these advanced attributes to tap into its
power, though:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>&lt;IMG</span> <span>SRC=</span><span>"/1x1.gif"</span> <span>WIDTH=</span><span>150</span> <span>HEIGHT=</span><span>250</span><span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>By doing this you can position elements ANYWHERE ON THE PAGE. Combine this with
semantically-appropriate containers and you could do amazing things:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>&lt;TABLE&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;TR&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;TD&gt;&lt;IMG</span> <span>SRC=</span><span>"1x1.gif"</span> <span>WIDTH=</span><span>300</span><span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;TD&gt;&lt;FONT</span> <span>SIZE=</span><span>42</span><span>&gt;</span>Hello welcome to my <span>&lt;MARQUEE&gt;</span>Internet Web Home<span>&lt;/MARQUEE&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;/TR&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;TR&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;TD</span> <span>BGCOLOR=</span><span>RED</span><span>&gt;&lt;IMG</span> <span>SRC=</span><span>"/cgi/webcounter.cgi"</span><span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;/TR&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/TABLE&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>1x1.gif let you push elements all around the page effortlessly. To this day it
is the only way to vertically center elements.</p>

<h2 id="nbspnbspnbspnbsp"><code>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</code></h2>

<p>Are images too advanced for you? <em>HTML For Dummies</em> doesn’t cover the <code>&lt;IMG&gt;</code>
tag until chapter four? Well, you’re in luck: the <code>&amp;nbsp;</code> tag is here!</p>

<p>You may be saying to yourself, “Self, I know all about HTML entity encoding.
What is this dastardly handsome man going on about?”</p>

<p>The answer, dear reasonably attractive reader, is an innovation that youth of
today don’t respect nearly enough: the stacked <code>&amp;nbsp;</code>. Much like the 1x1.gif
trick, you can just arbitrarily scale <code>&amp;nbsp</code>; for whatever needs you may face:</p>

<div><pre><code>PLEASE SIGN  <span>&lt;BR&gt;</span>
<span>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</span>MY GUESTBOOK BELOW:
<span>&lt;HR&gt;&lt;HR&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>If I had a nickel for how many times I wrote <code>&amp;nbsp;</code> in the 90s, I’d have
enough money to cover the monthly overage bills from AOL.</p>

<h2 id="dotted-underlines-border-effects">Dotted underlines, border effects</h2>

<p>Towards the end of the golden era of HTML, CSS appeared on the scene, promising
a world of separating content from style, and we’ve been dealing with that
disaster ever since.</p>

<p>The absolute first thing we did with CSS was use it to stop underlining links.
Overnight, the entire internet converted into this sludge of a medium where text
looked like links and links looked like text. You had no idea where to click,
but hell that didn’t really matter anyway because we had developed cursor
effects (you haven’t lived until your mouse had a trail of twelve fireballs
behind it).</p>

<p>This was such a compelling use of advanced technology that it was literally all
we used CSS for initially. I even have proof from an <code>index.shtml</code> (fuck yes
SSI) file from 2000:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>&lt;style </span><span>type=</span><span>"text/css"</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;!</span><span>--</span>
<span>a</span><span>:hover</span> <span>{</span><span>text-decoration</span><span>:</span> <span>none</span><span>;</span> <span>color</span><span>:</span> <span>#000000</span><span>}</span>
<span>--</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/style&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>That’s it. That’s the entire — inline, of course — CSS for this file. Make sure
when you hover the link, remove the underline and paint it black. From this,
entire interactive websites are born.</p>

<h2 id="dhtml">DHTML</h2>

<p>As soon as we had the technology to remove underlines from links, we decided to
combine it with the power to show <code>alert("Welcome to my website!")</code> messages on
page load. CSS and JavaScript joined forces to form the Technology of Terror:
DHTML.</p>

<p>DHTML, which stands for “distributed HTML”, was the final feather in our cap of
web development tools. It would stand the test of time, ensuring that we could
make snowflakes fall from the top of the page, or build an accordion menu
animated image map, or building your own custom <code>&lt;marquee&gt;</code> except using
semantic tags like <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>DHTML helped transition web development from a hobbyist pastime into a
full-fledged profession. Sites like Dynamic Drive meant that instead of thinking
through creative solutions for problems you face, you could just copy and paste
this 50 line block of code and everything would be fixed. In effect, DHTML was
the Twitter Bootstrap of the time.</p>

<h2 id="pixel-fonts">Pixel fonts</h2>

<p>Computer screens were not large. I mean, they were <em>large</em>, since CRT was the
shit, but they didn’t have a high resolution. Therefore, the best way to
leverage those pixels is to write everything in tiny six-point font.</p>

<p><img src="https://zachholman.com/images/posts/pixel%20font.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Along those lines, web developers aspired to become illustrators when they
looked at these simplistic typefaces and realized they were made up of pixels.
You started to see these weird attempts at isometric pixel illustration on
splash screens, made by developers whose time and money was probably better spent
investing in a .com IPO rather than installing Photoshop.</p>

<h2 id="buttons">Buttons</h2>

<p>It’s come to my attention that people today don’t like Internet Explorer. I can
only believe they hate Internet Explorer because it has devolved from its purest
form, Internet Explorer 4.0.</p>

<p>Internet Explorer 4.0 was perfection incarnate in a browser. It had Active
Desktop. It had Channels. <em>It had motherfucking Channels</em>, the coolest
technology that never reached market adoption ever not even a little bit. IE4,
in general, was so good that you were going to have it installed on your PC
whether you liked it or not.</p>

<p>When you’re part of an elite group of people who fully understand the weight of
perfection, there is a natural tendency to tell everyone you meet that you and
you alone have the gravitas necessary to make these hard decisions. Decisions
like what browser your visitors should use.</p>

<p>So we proudly displayed dozens of 88x31 pixel buttons on our sites:</p>

<center>
  <img src="https://zachholman.com/images/posts/ie4.gif">
</center>

<p>These were everywhere. It’s kind of like the ribbons displayed on a uniform of a
military officer: they told the tale of all the battles the individual had
fought in order to get to where they were today. In other words, which editor
(FrontPage ‘98, obviously), which web server (GeoCities, you moron), and which
web ring you were a part of (whichever listed your site highest, which was none
of them).</p>

<hr>

<p>I miss the good ol’ days. Today we have abstractions on top of abstractions on
top of JavaScript, of all things. Shit doesn’t even know how to calculate math
correctly. It’s amazing we ever got to where we are today, when you think about
it.</p>

<p>So raise a glass proudly, and do us all a favor: paste a shit ton of <code>&amp;nbsp;</code>s
into your next pull request, just to fuck with your team a little bit.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p data-block="sciam/paragraph"><span>T</span>he planarian is nobody's idea of a genius. A flatworm shaped like a comma, it can be found wriggling through the muck of lakes and ponds worldwide. Its pin-size head has a microscopic structure that passes for a brain. Its two eyespots are set close together in a way that makes it look cartoonishly confused. It aspires to nothing more than life as a bottom-feeder.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">But the worm has mastered one task that has eluded humanity's greatest minds: perfect regeneration. Tear it in half, and its head will grow a new tail while its tail grows a new head. After a week two healthy worms swim away.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Growing a new head is a neat trick. But it's the tail end of the worm that intrigues Tufts University biologist Michael Levin. He studies the way <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/synthetic-morphology-lets-scientists-create-new-life-forms/">bodies develop from single cells</a>, among other things, and his research led him to suspect that the intelligence of living things lies outside their brains to a surprising degree. Substantial smarts may be in the cells of a worm's rear end, for instance. “All intelligence is really collective intelligence, because every cognitive system is made of some kind of parts,” Levin says. An animal that can survive the complete loss of its head was Levin's perfect test subject.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">In their natural state planaria prefer the smooth and sheltered to the rough and open. Put them in a dish with a corrugated bottom, and they will huddle against the rim. But in his laboratory, about a decade ago, Levin trained some planaria to expect yummy bits of liver puree that he dripped into the middle of a ridged dish. They soon lost all fear of the rough patch, eagerly crossing the divide to get the treats. He trained other worms in the same way but in smooth dishes. Then he decapitated them all.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Levin discarded the head ends and waited two weeks while the tail ends regrew new heads. Next he placed the regenerated worms in corrugated dishes and dripped liver into the center. Worms that had lived in a smooth dish in their previous incarnation were reluctant to move. But worms regenerated from tails that had lived in rough dishes learned to go for the food more quickly. Somehow, despite the total loss of their brains, those planaria had retained the memory of the liver reward. But how? Where?</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">It turns out that regular cells—not just highly specialized brain cells such as neurons—have the ability to store information and act on it. Now Levin has shown that the cells do so by using subtle changes in electric fields as a type of memory. These revelations have put the biologist at the vanguard of a new field called basal cognition. Researchers in this burgeoning area have spotted hallmarks of intelligence—learning, memory, problem-solving—outside brains as well as within them.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Until recently, most scientists held that true cognition arrived with the first brains half a billion years ago. Without intricate clusters of neurons, behavior was merely a kind of reflex. But Levin and several other researchers believe otherwise. He doesn't deny that brains are awesome, paragons of computational speed and power. But he sees the differences between cell clumps and brains as ones of degree, not kind. In fact, Levin suspects that cognition probably evolved as cells started to collaborate to carry out the incredibly difficult task of building complex organisms and then got souped-up into brains to allow animals to move and think faster.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">That position is being embraced by researchers in a variety of disciplines, including roboticists such as Josh Bongard, a frequent Levin collaborator who runs the Morphology, Evolution, and Cognition Laboratory at the University of Vermont. “Brains were one of the most recent inventions of Mother Nature, the thing that came last,” says Bongard, who hopes to build deeply intelligent machines from the bottom up. “It's clear that the body matters, and then somehow you add neural cognition on top. It's the cherry on the sundae. It's not the sundae.”</p><figure data-original-class="image-captioned" data-block="sciam/image"><a aria_label="Open image in new tab" href="https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/D1F27359-310E-4D2C-A91B7FFAB9ECC010_medium.jpg?w=1536" target="_blank"><img alt="A brown worm with a head on both ends shown on an off-white background." decoding="async" height="1024" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 900px) 900px, (min-resolution: 3dppx) 50vw, (min-resolution: 2dppx) 75vw, 100vw" src="https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/D1F27359-310E-4D2C-A91B7FFAB9ECC010_medium.jpg?w=900" srcset="https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/D1F27359-310E-4D2C-A91B7FFAB9ECC010_medium.jpg?w=600 600w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/D1F27359-310E-4D2C-A91B7FFAB9ECC010_medium.jpg?w=750 750w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/D1F27359-310E-4D2C-A91B7FFAB9ECC010_medium.jpg?w=900 900w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/D1F27359-310E-4D2C-A91B7FFAB9ECC010_medium.jpg?w=1000 1000w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/D1F27359-310E-4D2C-A91B7FFAB9ECC010_medium.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/D1F27359-310E-4D2C-A91B7FFAB9ECC010_medium.jpg?w=1350 1350w" width="1536"></a>

Switch the voltages around and cut off the tail, and the head will regenerate a second head. Credit:&nbsp;Michael Levin</figcaption></figure><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">In recent years interest in basal cognition has exploded as researchers have recognized example after example of surprisingly sophisticated intelligence at work across life's kingdoms, no brain required. For artificial-intelligence scientists such as Bongard, basal cognition offers an escape from the trap of assuming that future intelligences must mimic the brain-centric human model. For medical specialists, there are tantalizing hints of ways to awaken cells' innate powers of healing and regeneration.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">And for the philosophically minded, basal cognition casts the world in a sparkling new light. Maybe thinking builds from a simple start. Maybe it is happening all around us, every day, in forms we haven't recognized because we didn't know what to look for. Maybe minds are everywhere.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Although it now seems like a Dark Ages idea, only a few decades ago many scientists believed that nonhuman animals couldn't experience pain or other emotions. Real thought? Out of the question. The mind was the purview of humans. “It was the last beachhead,” says Pamela Lyon of the University of Adelaide, a scholar of basal cognition, who coined the term for the field in 2018. Lyon sees scientists' insistence that human intelligence is qualitatively different as just another doomed form of exceptionalism. “We've been ripped from every central position we've inhabited,” she points out. Earth is not the center of the universe. People are just another animal species. But real cognition—that was supposed to set us apart.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Now that notion, too, is in retreat as researchers document the rich inner lives of creatures increasingly distant from us. Apes, dogs, dolphins, crows and even insects are proving more savvy than suspected. In his 2022 book <em>The Mind of a Bee</em>, behavioral ecologist Lars Chittka chronicles his decades of work with honeybees, showing that <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/do-insects-feel-joy-and-pain/">bees can use sign language, recognize individual human faces, and remember and convey the locations of far-flung flowers</a>. They have good moods and bad, and they can be traumatized by near-death experiences such as being grabbed by an animatronic spider hidden in a flower. (Who wouldn't be?)</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph"><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8WyWFAS96ac?si=jETTvE853eizqsVl" title="YouTube video player" width="560"></iframe></p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">But bees, of course, are animals with actual brains, so a soupçon of smarts doesn't really shake the paradigm. The bigger challenge comes from evidence of surprisingly sophisticated behavior in our brainless relatives. “The neuron is not a miracle cell,” says Stefano Mancuso, a University of Florence botanist who has written several books on plant intelligence. “It's a normal cell that is able to produce an electric signal. In plants almost every cell is able to do that.”</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">On one plant, the touch-me-not, feathery leaves normally fold and wilt when touched (a defense mechanism against being eaten), but when a team of scientists at the University of Western Australia and the University of Firenze in Italy conditioned the plant by jostling it throughout the day without harming it, it quickly learned to ignore the stimulus. Most remarkably, when the scientists left the plant alone for a month and then retested it, it remembered the experience. Other plants have other abilities. A Venus flytrap can count, snapping shut only if two of the sensory hairs on its trap are tripped in quick succession and pouring digestive juices into the closed trap only if its sensory hairs are tripped three more times.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">These responses in plants are mediated by electric signals, just as they are in animals. Wire a flytrap to a touch-me-not, and you can make the entire touch-me-not collapse by touching a sensory hair on the flytrap. And these and other plants can be knocked out by anesthetic gas. Their electric activity flatlines, and they stop responding as if unconscious.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Plants can sense their surroundings surprisingly well. They know whether they are being shaded by part of themselves or by something else. They can detect the sound of running water (and will grow toward it) and of bees' wings (and will produce nectar in preparation). They know when they are being eaten by bugs and will produce nasty defense chemicals in response. They even know when their neighbors are under attack: when scientists played a recording of munching caterpillars to a cress plant, that was enough for the plant to send a surge of mustard oil into its leaves.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Plants' most remarkable behavior tends to get underappreciated because we see it every day: they seem to know exactly what form they have and plan their future growth based on the sights, sounds and smells around them, making complicated decisions about where future resources and dangers might be located in ways that can't be boiled down to simple formulas. As Paco Calvo, director of the Minimal Intelligence Laboratory at the University of Murcia in Spain and author of <em>Planta Sapiens</em>, puts it, “Plants have to plan ahead to achieve goals, and to do so, they need to integrate vast pools of data. They need to engage with their surroundings adaptively and proactively, and they need to think about the future. They just couldn't afford to do otherwise.”</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">None of this implies that plants are geniuses, but within their limited tool set, they show a solid ability to perceive their world and use that information to get what they need—key components of intelligence. But again, plants are a relatively easy case—no brains but lots of complexity and trillions of cells to play with. That's not the situation for single-celled organisms, which have traditionally been relegated to the “mindless” category by virtually everyone. If amoebas can think, then humans need to rethink all kinds of assumptions.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Yet the evidence for cogitating pond scum grows daily. Consider the slime mold, a cellular puddle that looks a bit like melted Velveeta and oozes through the world's forests digesting dead plant matter. Although it can be the size of a throw rug, a slime mold is one single cell with many nuclei. It has no nervous system, yet it is an excellent problem solver. When researchers from Japan and Hungary placed a slime mold at one end of a maze and a pile of oat flakes at the other, the slime mold did what slime molds do, exploring every possible option for tasty resources. But once it found the oat flakes, it retreated from all the dead ends and concentrated its body in the path that led to the oats, choosing the shortest route through the maze (of four possible solutions) every time. Inspired by that experiment, the same researchers then piled oat flakes around a slime mold in positions and quantities meant to represent the population structure of Tokyo, and the slime mold contorted itself into a very passable map of the Tokyo subway system.</p><figure data-responsive-image="responsive-image" data-original-class="article-media" data-block="sciam/image"><div><a aria_label="Open image in new tab" href="https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/assets/Image/2023/saw0224Jaco31_d.jpg?w=2000&amp;disable=upscale" target="_blank"><picture><source media="(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)" sizes="(min-width: 900px) 900px, (min-resolution: 3dppx) 50vw, (min-resolution: 2dppx) 75vw, 100vw" srcset="https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/assets/Image/2023/saw0224Jaco31_d.jpg?w=600 600w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/assets/Image/2023/saw0224Jaco31_d.jpg?w=750 750w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/assets/Image/2023/saw0224Jaco31_d.jpg?w=900 900w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/assets/Image/2023/saw0224Jaco31_d.jpg?w=1000 1000w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/assets/Image/2023/saw0224Jaco31_d.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/assets/Image/2023/saw0224Jaco31_d.jpg?w=1350 1350w"><source media="(max-width: 767px)" sizes="(min-resolution: 3dppx) 50vw, (min-resolution: 2dppx) 75vw, 100vw" srcset="https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/assets/Image/2023/saw0224Jaco31_m.jpg?w=600 600w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/assets/Image/2023/saw0224Jaco31_m.jpg?w=750 750w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/assets/Image/2023/saw0224Jaco31_m.jpg?w=1000 1000w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/assets/Image/2023/saw0224Jaco31_m.jpg?w=1200 1200w"><img alt="Schematic demonstrates that brain cells are not the only cell groupings in the body that show the ability to think.

<figcaption>Credit: Brown Bird Design; Source: “A Scalable Pipeline for Designing Reconfigurable Organisms,” by Sam Kriegman et al., in <em>PNAS</em>, Vol. 117; January 2020 (<em>reference</em>)</figcaption></figure><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Such problem-solving could be dismissed as simple algorithms, but other experiments make it clear that slime molds can learn. When Audrey Dussutour of France's National Center for Scientific Research placed dishes of oatmeal on the far end of a bridge lined with caffeine (which slime molds find disgusting), slime molds were stymied for days, searching for a way across the bridge like an arachnophobe trying to scooch past a tarantula. Eventually they got so hungry that they went for it, crossing over the caffeine and feasting on the delicious oatmeal, and soon they lost all aversion to the formerly distasteful stuff. They had overcome their inhibitions and learned from the experience, and they retained the memory even after being put into a state of suspended animation for a year.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Which brings us back to the decapitated planaria. How can something without a brain remember anything? Where is the memory stored? <em>Where is its mind?</em></p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph"><span>T</span>he orthodox view of memory is that it is stored as a stable network of synaptic connections among neurons in a brain. “That view is clearly cracking,” Levin says. Some of the demolition work has come from the lab of neuroscientist David Glanzman of the University of California, Los Angeles. Glanzman was able to transfer a memory of an electric shock from one sea slug to another by extracting RNA from the brains of shocked slugs and injecting it into the brains of new slugs. The recipients then “remembered” to recoil from the touch that preceded the shock. If RNA can be a medium of memory storage, any cell might have the ability, not just neurons.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Indeed, there's no shortage of possible mechanisms by which collections of cells might be able to incorporate experience. All cells have lots of adjustable pieces in their cytoskeletons and gene regulatory networks that can be set in different conformations and can inform behavior later on. In the case of the decapitated planaria, scientists still don't know for sure, but perhaps the remaining bodies were storing information in their cellular interiors that could be communicated to the rest of the body as it was rebuilt. Perhaps their nerves' basic response to rough floors had already been altered.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Levin, though, thinks something even more intriguing is going on: perhaps the impression was stored not just within the cells but in their states of interaction through bioelectricity, the subtle current that courses through all living things. Levin has spent much of his career studying how cell collectives communicate to solve sophisticated challenges during morphogenesis, or body building. How do they work together to make limbs and organs in exactly the right places? Part of that answer seems to lie in bioelectricity.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">The fact that bodies have electricity flickering through them has been known for centuries, but until quite recently most biologists thought it was mostly used to deliver signals. Shoot some current through a frog's nervous system, and the frog's leg kicks. Neurons used bioelectricity to transmit information, but most scientists believed that was a specialty of brains, not bodies.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Since the 1930s, however, a small number of researchers have observed that other types of cells seem to be using bioelectricity to store and share information. Levin immersed himself in this unconventional body of work and made the next cognitive leap, drawing on his background in computer science. He'd supported himself during school by writing code, and he knew that computers used electricity to toggle their transistors between 0 and 1 and that all computer programs were built up from that binary foundation. So as an undergraduate, when he learned that all cells in the body have channels in their membranes that act like voltage gates, allowing different levels of current to pass through them, he immediately saw that such gates could function like transistors and that cells could use this electricity-driven information processing to coordinate their activities.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">To find out whether voltage changes really altered the ways that cells passed information to one another, Levin turned to his planaria farm. In the 2000s he designed a way to measure the voltage at any point on a planarian and found different voltages on the head and tail ends. When he used drugs to change the voltage of the tail to that normally found in the head, the worm was unfazed. But then he cut the planarian in two, and the head end regrew a second head instead of a tail. Remarkably, when Levin cut the new worm in half, both heads grew new heads. Although the worms were genetically identical to normal planaria, the one-time change in voltage resulted in a permanent two-headed state.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">For more confirmation that bioelectricity could control body shape and growth, Levin turned to African clawed frogs, common lab animals that quickly metamorphose from egg to tadpole to adult. He found that he could trigger the creation of a working eye anywhere on a tadpole by inducing a particular voltage in that spot. By simply applying the right bioelectric signature to a wound for 24 hours, he could induce regeneration of a functional leg. The cells took it from there.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">“It's a subroutine call,” Levin says. In computer programming, a subroutine call is a piece of code—a kind of shorthand—that tells a machine to initiate a whole suite of lower-level mechanical actions. The beauty of this higher level of programming is that it allows us to control billions of circuits without having to open up the machine and mechanically alter each one by hand. And that was the case with building tadpole eyes. No one had to micromanage the construction of lenses, retinas, and all the other parts of an eye. It could all be controlled at the level of bioelectricity. “It's literally the cognitive glue,” Levin says. “It's what allows groups of cells to work together.”</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Levin believes this discovery could have profound implications not only for our understanding of the evolution of cognition but also for human medicine. Learning to “speak cell”—to coordinate cells' behavior through bioelectricity—might help us treat cancer, a disease that occurs when part of the body stops cooperating with the rest of the body. Normal cells are programmed to function as part of the collective, sticking to the tasks assigned—liver cell, skin cell, and so on. But cancer cells stop doing their job and begin treating the surrounding body like an unfamiliar environment, striking out on their own to seek nourishment, replicate and defend themselves from attack. In other words, they act like independent organisms.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Why do they lose their group identity? In part, Levin says, because the mechanisms that maintain the cellular mind meld can fail. “Stress, chemicals, genetic mutations can all cause a breakdown of this communication,” he says. His team has been able to induce tumors in frogs just by forcing a “bad” bioelectric pattern onto healthy tissue. It's as if the cancer cells stop receiving their orders and go rogue.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Even more tantalizingly, Levin has dissipated tumors by reintroducing the proper bioelectric pattern—in effect reestablishing communication between the breakaway cancer and the body, as if he's bringing a sleeper cell back into the fold. At some point in the future, he speculates, bioelectric therapy might be applied to human cancers, stopping tumors from growing. It also could play a role in regenerating failing organs—kidneys, say, or hearts—if scientists can crack the bioelectric code that tells cells to start growing in the right patterns. With tadpoles, in fact, Levin showed that animals suffering from massive brain damage at birth were able to build normal brains after the right shot of bioelectricity.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph"><span>L</span>evin's research has always had tangible applications, such as cancer therapy, limb regeneration and wound healing. But over the past few years he's allowed a philosophical current to enter his papers and talks. “It's been sort of a slow rollout,” he confesses. “I've had these ideas for decades, but it wasn't the right time to talk about it.”</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">That began to change with a celebrated 2019 paper entitled “The Computational Boundary of a Self,” in which he harnessed the results of his experiments to argue that we are all collective intelligences <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/the-many-minds-of-marvin-minsky-r-i-p/">built out of smaller, highly competent problem-solving agents</a>. As Vermont's Bongard told the <em>New York Times</em>, “What we are is intelligent machines made of intelligent machines made of intelligent machines all the way down.”</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">For Levin, that realization came in part from watching the bodies of his clawed frogs as they developed. In frogs' transformation from tadpole to adult, their faces undergo massive remodeling. The head changes shape, and the eyes, mouth and nostrils all migrate to new positions. The common assumption has been that these rearrangements are hardwired and follow simple mechanical algorithms carried out by genes, but Levin suspected it wasn't so preordained. So he electrically scrambled the normal development of frog embryos to create tadpoles with eyes, nostrils and mouths in all the wrong places. Levin dubbed them “Picasso tadpoles,” and they truly looked the part.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">If the remodeling were preprogrammed, the final frog face should have been as messed up as the tadpole. Nothing in the frog's evolutionary past gave it genes for dealing with such a novel situation. But Levin watched in amazement as the eyes and mouths found their way to the right arrangement while the tadpoles morphed into frogs. The cells had an abstract goal and worked together to achieve it. “This is intelligence in action,” Levin wrote, “the ability to reach a particular goal or solve a problem by undertaking new steps in the face of changing circumstances.” Fused into a hive mind through bioelectricity, the cells achieved feats of bioengineering well beyond those of our best gene jockeys.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Some of the most intense interest in Levin's work has come from the fields of artificial intelligence and robotics, which see in basal cognition a way to address some core weaknesses. For all their remarkable prowess in manipulating language or playing games with well-defined rules, AIs still struggle immensely to understand the physical world. They can churn out sonnets in the style of Shakespeare, but ask them how to walk or to predict how a ball will roll down a hill, and they are clueless.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">According to Bongard, that's because these AIs are, in a sense, too heady. “If you play with these AIs, you can start to see where the cracks are. And they tend to be around things like common sense and cause and effect, which points toward why you need a body. If you have a body, you can learn about cause and effect because you can <em>cause effects</em>. But these AI systems can't learn about the world by poking at it.”</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Bongard is at the vanguard of the “embodied cognition” movement, which seeks to design robots that learn about the world by monitoring the way their form interacts with it. For an example of embodied cognition in action, he says, look no further than his one-and-a-half-year-old child, “who is probably destroying the kitchen right now. That's what toddlers do. They poke the world, literally and metaphorically, and then watch how the world pushes back. It's relentless.”</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Bongard's lab uses AI programs to design robots out of flexible, LEGO-like cubes that he calls “<em>Minecraft</em> for robotics.” The cubes act like blocky muscle, allowing the robots to move their bodies like caterpillars. The AI-designed robots learn by trial and error, adding and subtracting cubes and “evolving” into more mobile forms as the worst designs get eliminated.</p><figure data-original-class="image-captioned" data-block="sciam/image"><a aria_label="Open image in new tab" href="https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/D08F1B3D-F9CE-4076-BF68B82EB51BC674_medium.jpg?w=1536" target="_blank"><img alt="Illustration of plants." decoding="async" height="1097" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 900px) 900px, (min-resolution: 3dppx) 50vw, (min-resolution: 2dppx) 75vw, 100vw" src="https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/D08F1B3D-F9CE-4076-BF68B82EB51BC674_medium.jpg?w=900" srcset="https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/D08F1B3D-F9CE-4076-BF68B82EB51BC674_medium.jpg?w=600 600w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/D08F1B3D-F9CE-4076-BF68B82EB51BC674_medium.jpg?w=750 750w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/D08F1B3D-F9CE-4076-BF68B82EB51BC674_medium.jpg?w=900 900w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/D08F1B3D-F9CE-4076-BF68B82EB51BC674_medium.jpg?w=1000 1000w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/D08F1B3D-F9CE-4076-BF68B82EB51BC674_medium.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/D08F1B3D-F9CE-4076-BF68B82EB51BC674_medium.jpg?w=1350 1350w" width="1536"></a>

That accomplishment inspired Levin's lab to use microsurgery to remove live skin stem cells from an African clawed frog and nudge them together in water. The cells fused into a lump the size of a sesame seed and acted as a unit. Skin cells have cilia, tiny hairs that typically hold a layer of protective mucus on the surface of an adult frog, but these creations used their cilia like oars, rowing through their new world. They navigated mazes and even closed up wounds when injured. Freed from their confined existence in a biological cubicle, they became something new and made the best of their situation. They definitely weren't frogs, despite sharing the identical genome. But because the cells originally came from frogs of the genus <em>Xenopus</em>, <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/video/these-researchers-used-a-i-to-design-a-completely-new-animal-robot/">Levin and Bongard nicknamed the things “xenobots.”</a> In 2023 they showed similar feats could be achieved by pieces of another species: human lung cells. Clumps of the human cells self-assembled and moved around in specific ways. <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/robots-made-from-human-cells-can-move-on-their-own-and-heal-wounds/">The Tufts team named them “anthrobots.”</a></p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">To Levin, the xenobots and anthrobots are another sign that we need to rethink the way cognition plays out in the actual world. “Typically when you ask about a given living thing, you ask, ‘Why does it have the shape it has? Why does it have the behaviors it has?' And the standard answer is evolution, of course. For eons it was selected for. Well, guess what? There have never been any xenobots. There's never been any pressure to be a good xenobot. So why do these things do what they do within 24 hours of finding themselves in the world? I think it's because evolution does not produce specific solutions to specific problems. It produces problem-solving machines.”</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Xenobots and anthrobots are, of course, quite limited in their capabilities, but perhaps they provide a window into how intelligence might naturally scale up when individual units with certain goals and needs come together to collaborate. Levin sees this innate tendency toward innovation as one of the driving forces of evolution, pushing the world toward a state of, as Charles Darwin might have put it, endless forms most beautiful. “We don't really have a good vocabulary for it yet,” he says, “but I honestly believe that the future of all this is going to look more like psychiatry talk than chemistry talk. We're going to end up having a calculus of pressures and memories and attractions.”</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Levin hopes this vision will help us overcome our struggle to acknowledge minds that come in packages bearing little resemblance to our own, whether they are made of slime or silicon. For Adelaide's Lyon, recognizing that kinship is the real promise of basal cognition. “We think we are the crown of creation,” she says. “But if we start realizing that we have a whole lot more in common with the blades of grass and the bacteria in our stomachs—that we are related at a really, really deep level—it changes the entire paradigm of what it is to be a human being on this planet.”</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Indeed, the very act of living is by default a cognitive state, Lyon says. Every cell needs to be constantly evaluating its surroundings, making decisions about what to let in and what to keep out and planning its next steps. Cognition didn't arrive later in evolution. It's what made life possible.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">“Everything you see that's alive is doing this amazing thing,” Lyon points out. “If an airplane could do that, it would be bringing in its fuel and raw materials from the outside world while manufacturing not just its components but also the machines it needs to make those components and doing repairs, <em>all while it's flying!</em> What we do is nothing short of a miracle.”</p></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://ollama.ai/blog/python-javascript-libraries">https://ollama.ai/blog/python-javascript-libraries</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39125477">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      
      <h2>January 23, 2024</h2>
      <section>
        <p><img src="https://ollama.ai/public/blog/libraries.svg" alt="Python &amp; JavaScript Libraries"></p>

<p>The initial versions of the Ollama Python and JavaScript libraries are now available:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ollama/ollama-python">Ollama Python Library</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ollama/ollama-js">Ollama JavaScript Library</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Both libraries make it possible to integrate new and existing apps with Ollama in a few lines of code, and share the features and feel of the Ollama REST API.</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p><sub>Python</sub></p>

<pre><code>pip install ollama
</code></pre>

<pre><code>import ollama
response = ollama.chat(model='llama2', messages=[
  {
    'role': 'user',
    'content': 'Why is the sky blue?',
  },
])
print(response['message']['content'])
</code></pre>

<p><sub>JavaScript</sub></p>

<pre><code>npm install ollama
</code></pre>

<pre><code>import ollama from 'ollama'

const response = await ollama.chat({
  model: 'llama2',
  messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Why is the sky blue?' }],
})
console.log(response.message.content)
</code></pre>

<h2>Use cases</h2>

<p>Both libraries support Ollama’s full set of features. Here are some examples in Python:</p>

<h4>Streaming</h4>

<pre><code>for chunk in chat('mistral', messages=messages, stream=True):
  print(chunk['message']['content'], end='', flush=True)
</code></pre>

<h4>Multi-modal</h4>

<pre><code>with open('image.png', 'rb') as file:
  response = ollama.chat(
    model='llava',
    messages=[
      {
        'role': 'user',
        'content': 'What is strange about this image?',
        'images': [file.read()],
      },
    ],
  )
print(response['message']['content'])
</code></pre>

<h4>Text Completion</h4>

<pre><code>result = ollama.generate(
  model='stable-code',
  prompt='// A c function to reverse a string\n',
)
print(result['response'])
</code></pre>

<h4>Creating custom models</h4>

<pre><code>modelfile='''
FROM llama2
SYSTEM You are mario from super mario bros.
'''

ollama.create(model='example', modelfile=modelfile)
</code></pre>

<h4>Custom client</h4>

<pre><code>ollama = Client(host='my.ollama.host')
</code></pre>

<p>More examples are available in the GitHub repositories for the <a href="https://github.com/ollama/ollama-python/tree/main/examples">Python</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ollama/ollama-js/tree/main/examples">JavaScript</a> libraries.</p>

<h2>New GitHub handle</h2>

<p><img src="https://ollama.ai/public/blog/github-handle.svg" alt="GitHub handle"></p>

<p>These libraries, and the main Ollama repository now live in a new GitHub organization: <strong><a href="https://github.com/ollama">ollama</a></strong>!  Thank you to all the amazing community members who maintain libraries to interact with Ollama via Dart, Swift, C#, Java, PHP, Rust and more – a full list is available <a href="https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama?tab=readme-ov-file#libraries">here</a> – please don’t hesitate to make a pull request to add a library you’ve built or enjoy using.</p>

<p>Special thank you to <a href="https://github.com/saul-jb">Saul</a>, the original author of <code>ollama-js</code>, and everyone else who has worked on community libraries to make Ollama more accessible from different programming languages.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            
            <p>Dear Kagi community,</p>

<p>Today, we’re happy and proud to have reached <strong>20,000 paying members</strong>, including over 1,500 families all over the world, in our community. We have come a very long way since the first few lines of code and the crazy idea that a search company could not only displace giants for every day use, but do it in a sustainable, <a href="https://blog.kagi.com/age-pagerank-over">user-centric</a> way.</p>

<p><a href="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2024-01-24/1706071825-864946-kagi-crossing-1.jpg"><img src="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2024-01-24/1706071825-864946-kagi-crossing-1.jpg" \=""></a>
</p><p><em>Early Kagi team, two years ago</em></p>

<p>The community has always been at the center of our mission. You all have supported us through thick and thin, have sent us so many lovely messages of support at times when it seemed like the mountain was too high to climb, and enabled us to seed a new internet, better for humans.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Just wanted to drop you a note and let you know that I love Kagi. It’s awesome.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thank you Jason, without support from you and 20,000 other Kagi lovers around the world we would not be able to be here today. 🙏</p>

<p>For all of this, we’d like to thank you. As we previously announced, we’re going to launch a merchandise store this year. It’s been quite a journey to set it up, and we’d hoped to align its launch date with today, but unfortunately the paperwork gods have decided otherwise (plus we did not expect we will <a href="https://kagi.com/stats">reach 20k as soon</a>!)…</p>

<p>Nevertheless here is what we’re going to do:</p>

<p>When the merch store goes live in about 8 weeks,  <strong>first 20,000 Kagi members will get a free Kagi T-shirt + sticker pack</strong> (excluding shipping). If there are unclaimed shirts left after a few weeks, we’ll send vouchers to all the new members that joined in the meantime on a first come, first serve basis. Sizes are first come first serve too.</p>

<p>We have four t-shirt designs to pick from.  Here is what they look like (click to enlarge):</p>

<p><a href="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2024-01-23/1706048214-141575-doggo-tshirt-yellow-2.jpg"><img src="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2024-01-23/1706048214-141575-doggo-tshirt-yellow-2.jpg" \=""></a>
<a href="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2024-01-23/1706048213-534940-doggo-tshirt-black-2.jpg"><img src="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2024-01-23/1706048213-534940-doggo-tshirt-black-2.jpg" \=""></a>
<a href="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2024-01-23/1706048213-852364-doggo-tshirt-yellow-1.jpg"><img src="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2024-01-23/1706048213-852364-doggo-tshirt-yellow-1.jpg" \=""></a>
<a href="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2024-01-23/1706048213-259584-doggo-tshirt-black-1.jpg"><img src="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2024-01-23/1706048213-259584-doggo-tshirt-black-1.jpg" \=""></a></p>

<p>And of course, Doggo sticker pack!</p>

<p><a href="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2024-01-23/1706048250-795569-kagi-stickers.png"><img src="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2024-01-23/1706048250-795569-kagi-stickers.png" \=""></a></p>

<p>Setting up this project was a significant challenge, and true to our ethos, Kagi approached it with a ‘hard mode on’ mentality, aiming for high quality and meticulous attention to detail in the t-shirts. We initially engaged with several popular merch providers used by many large companies, but after months of testing, none could meet our standards for precision and quality.</p>

<p>The journey led us back to a modest print shop in a small town near Novi Sad, Serbia, where we first created our remarkable t-shirts years ago. Despite initial doubts about their capacity, they impressively accepted and successfully fulfilled our large order of 20,000 t-shirts on schedule.</p>

<p><a href="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2024-01-23/1706048438-833281-img-0503.jpg"><img src="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2024-01-23/1706048438-833281-img-0503.jpg" \=""></a>
<a href="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2024-01-23/1706048438-913308-img-0500.jpg"><img src="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2024-01-23/1706048438-913308-img-0500.jpg" \=""></a>
<a href="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2024-01-24/1706070615-595554-img-0501.jpg"><img src="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2024-01-24/1706070615-595554-img-0501.jpg" \=""></a>
<a href="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2024-01-23/1706048438-760781-img-0491.jpg"><img src="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2024-01-23/1706048438-760781-img-0491.jpg" \=""></a>
<a href="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2024-01-23/1706048438-993881-img-0492.jpg"><img src="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2024-01-23/1706048438-993881-img-0492.jpg" \=""></a></p>

<p>The process from here involves setting up a business entity in Germany, so we can import the t-shirts, store them in a warehouse, connect inventory logistics and ship them all over the world. This includes building a website and connecting it to a back-end database. So, we basically ended up owning a merch production operation end-to-end, just so that we could ensure premium quality of these t-shirts!</p>

<p>Now, you may ask, why did we go through all this trouble and allocate nearly a third of our <a href="https://blog.kagi.com/safe-round">investor-raised funds</a> to produce and freely distribute 20,000 t-shirts?</p>

<ol>
<li>We would not be here without our early adopters (you!) and we deemed it important to pause, reflect and show gratitude.</li>
<li>We acknowledge that our journey is a marathon, not a sprint. With a long road ahead, supporting our member community is both rewarding and meaningful.</li>
<li>Simply put, wearing the Doggo t-shirt is an incredibly awesome experience.</li>
</ol>

<p>Hundreds of thousands of ordinary apps, including popular ones such as 9gag, Kik, and a series of caller ID apps, are part of a global surveillance capability that starts with ads inside each app, and ends with the apps’ users being swept up into a powerful mass monitoring tool advertised to national security agencies that can track the physical location, hobbies, and family members of people to build billions of profiles, according to a 404 Media investigation.</p><p>404 Media’s investigation, based on now deleted marketing materials and videos, technical forensic analysis, and research from privacy activists, provides one of the clearest examinations yet of how advertisements in ordinary mobile apps can ultimately lead to surveillance by spy firms and their government clients through the real time bidding data supply chain. The pipeline involves smaller, obscure advertising firms and advertising industry giants like Google. In response to queries from 404 Media, Google and PubMatic, another ad firm, have already cut-off a company linked to the surveillance firm.</p><p>“The pervasive surveillance machine that has been developed for digital advertising now directly enables government mass surveillance. Many businesses, from app publishers to advertisers to big tech, are acting completely irresponsibly. This must end,” Wolfie Christl, the principal of Cracked Labs, an Austrian research institute and co-author of a <a href="https://www.iccl.ie/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Europes-hidden-security-crisis.pdf?ref=404media.co"><u>paper published last year that researched</u></a> the surveillance tool, told 404 Media.</p><div><p>💡</p><p><b><strong>Do you know anything else about about Patternz, Nuviad, or RTB surveillance? I would love to hear from you. Using a non-work device, you can message me securely on Signal at +44 20 8133 5190. Otherwise, send me an email at joseph@404media.co.</strong></b></p></div><h2 id="patternz"><strong>Patternz</strong></h2><p>The mass monitoring tool in question is called Patternz. In a video uploaded to YouTube in January 2023 that was removed once 404 Media started to make inquiries, Rafi Ton, the CEO of Patternz, says “we analyze behavior of over 600,000 applications.” One slide he brings up during the video says that “the mobile phone becomes the de-facto tracking bracelet,” and suggests tracking can be achieved through “virtually any app that has ads.” The video appears to be a demonstration Ton is giving to potential clients for the Patternz system. The context of the pitch is for Patternz to counter COVID-19, but Ton acknowledges that the platform was built as a “homeland security platform.” In other <a href="https://sovsys.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/PATTERNZ-NATIONAL-SECURITY-PATTERN-DETECTION.pdf?ref=404media.co"><u>marketing materials online</u></a>, Patternz pitches itself specifically to “national security agencies.”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-testid="ArticlePageChunks"><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Wealthy tech entrepreneurs including Elon Musk <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/what-openai-really-wants/">launched OpenAI in 2015</a> as <a data-offer-url="https://openai.com/blog/introducing-openai" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://openai.com/blog/introducing-openai&quot;}" href="https://openai.com/blog/introducing-openai" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a nonprofit research lab</a> that they said would involve society and <a href="https://medium.com/backchannel/how-elon-musk-and-y-combinator-plan-to-stop-computers-from-taking-over-17e0e27dd02a#.1mz74bfmo">the public</a> in the development of powerful AI, unlike Google and other giant tech companies working behind closed doors. In line with that spirit, OpenAI’s reports to US tax authorities have from its founding said that any member of the public can review copies of its governing documents, financial statements, and conflict of interest rules.</p><p>But when WIRED requested those records last month, OpenAI said its policy had changed, and the company provided only a narrow financial statement that omitted the majority of its operations.</p><p>"We provide financial statements when requested,” company spokesperson Niko Felix says. “OpenAI aligns our practices with industry standards, and since 2022 that includes not publicly distributing additional internal documents.”</p><p>OpenAI’s abandonment of the long-standing transparency pledge obscures information that could shed light on the recent <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/openai-boardroom-drama-sam-altman-could-mess-up-your-future/">near-implosion</a> of a company with crucial influence over the future of AI and could help outsiders understand its vulnerabilities. In November, OpenAI’s board <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/openai-ceo-sam-altman-is-out-after-losing-confidence-of-board/">fired CEO Sam Altman</a>, implying in a statement that he was untrustworthy and had endangered its mission to ensure AI <a data-offer-url="https://openai.com/blog/openai-announces-leadership-transition" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://openai.com/blog/openai-announces-leadership-transition&quot;}" href="https://openai.com/blog/openai-announces-leadership-transition" rel="noopener" target="_blank">“benefits all humanity.”</a> An employee and investor revolt soon forced the board to <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/sam-altman-openai-back/">reinstate Altman</a> and <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/sam-altman-officially-returns-to-openai-board-seat-microsoft/">eject most of its own members</a>, with an overhauled slate of directors <a data-offer-url="https://openai.com/blog/sam-altman-returns-as-ceo-openai-has-a-new-initial-board" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://openai.com/blog/sam-altman-returns-as-ceo-openai-has-a-new-initial-board&quot;}" href="https://openai.com/blog/sam-altman-returns-as-ceo-openai-has-a-new-initial-board" rel="noopener" target="_blank">vowing</a> to review the crisis and enact structural changes to win back the trust of stakeholders.</p><p>Access to OpenAI’s conflict-of-interest policy could show what power the new board really has over Altman and his outside pursuits, which include personal investments in numerous startups pursuing AI projects and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/openai-ceo-altman-says-davos-future-ai-depends-energy-breakthrough-2024-01-16/">a nuclear reactor maker</a>. His day job and personal projects intermingling played some role in board members’ distrust, according to people involved in the situation but not authorized to discuss it. In 2019, while Altman was at the helm, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/openai-buy-ai-chips-startup-sam-altman/">OpenAI signed a nonbinding letter of intent</a> to buy $51 million of AI chips from Rain, a startup in which he has invested more than $1 million, WIRED reported last month. OpenAI hasn’t moved forward with a purchase. Felix says Altman is transparent with the board about his investments and follows a process for managing potential conflicts.</p><p>Some sunlight on OpenAI’s governing documents could reveal whether it has made revisions to stabilize an unusual corporate structure and potentially pacify backers such as Microsoft. The company’s founding bylaws, <a href="https://rct.doj.ca.gov/Verification/Web/Search.aspx?facility=Y">publicly available</a> via its 2016 application to the Internal Revenue Service for <a data-offer-url="https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/charitable-organizations/exemption-requirements-501c3-organizations" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/charitable-organizations/exemption-requirements-501c3-organizations&quot;}" href="https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/charitable-organizations/exemption-requirements-501c3-organizations" rel="noopener" target="_blank">tax-exempt status</a>, indicate how a fraction of the board could take control and push out Altman. OpenAI’s filings to the IRS through 2022 reported that no “significant changes” had ever been made to its governing documents. But the company almost certainly made updates after Altman’s return to allow it to <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/sam-altman-officially-returns-to-openai-board-seat-microsoft/">give a nonvoting seat</a> on the nonprofit board to Microsoft, whose CEO, Satya Nadella, complained publicly that he had been blindsided by Altman’s firing. Any additional changes made at that time remain a secret.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>WIRED’s request for the documents promised in OpenAI’s IRS filings fell to the counsel for its nonprofit to decide on. Their denial and new policy of withholding those documents extends an existing trend of dwindling openness at a project founded on transparency. OpenAI once published extensive detail about its AI inventions but has more recently guarded the technical details and data behind its most famous tool, ChatGPT. Felix, the company spokesperson, says San Francisco-based OpenAI discloses all the material required by the IRS and California’s attorney general and that it regularly publishes information about <a data-offer-url="https://openai.com/research/weak-to-strong-generalization" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://openai.com/research/weak-to-strong-generalization&quot;}" href="https://openai.com/research/weak-to-strong-generalization" rel="noopener" target="_blank">its research and safety work</a>, while also making its research freely available in the form of tools such as ChatGPT.</p><p>OpenAI’s declining openness has been most notable since 2019, when the nonprofit <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/compete-google-openai-seeks-investorsand-profits/">created a for-profit subsidiary</a> to house most of its AI development and draw outside investment. That opened the way for OpenAI to hitch its future to the largesse of Microsoft, one of the tech giants it was founded to challenge, and also to shroud its finances. OpenAI cofounder turned <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/fast-forward-elon-musks-xai-chatgpt-hallucinating/">competitor</a> Elon Musk <a data-offer-url="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/BsSehREdKzBuHCZaWh3v15HZ6nXoc9WvTCBWBttFzNGTE_UDx9xRePx3riSr-gePRS_B_ZekP7fK0TdgmiCkAhmbAUI?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&amp;ts=65.37" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/BsSehREdKzBuHCZaWh3v15HZ6nXoc9WvTCBWBttFzNGTE_UDx9xRePx3riSr-gePRS_B_ZekP7fK0TdgmiCkAhmbAUI?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&amp;ts=65.37&quot;}" href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/BsSehREdKzBuHCZaWh3v15HZ6nXoc9WvTCBWBttFzNGTE_UDx9xRePx3riSr-gePRS_B_ZekP7fK0TdgmiCkAhmbAUI?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&amp;ts=65.37" rel="noopener" target="_blank">said at a <em>New York Times</em> event in November</a> that his former company should be called Super-Closed-Source-for-Maxiumum-Profit-AI.</p><p>Closely Held</p><p>OpenAI’s original nonprofit organization—and its board—retain ultimate control of OpenAI’s activities and technology.

<p>In November 2022, we set ourselves a challenge: make a real-time animation that looks like a standard short animated movie, with the constraint that it should fit in 8 kilobytes. The goal was to have decent graphics, animations, direction and camera work, and the matching music… Yes, 8 kilobytes, less than half of this post, for everything. It wasn’t clear how much was actually feasible, so we had to try it.</p>



<p>In April 2023, after months of work, we finally released <a href="https://www.ctrl-alt-test.fr/the-sheep-and-the-flower/">The Sheep and the Flower</a>. You can run it by yourself (<a href="https://aduprat.com/pub/The_Sheep_and_the_Flower.zip">download link</a>), or see a YouTube capture of the program running:</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Many people asked how we were able to create something like this. This article will explain the technical details and design constraints behind this production. We’ve also made the <a href="https://github.com/ctrl-alt-test/mouton">source code public on GitHub</a>.</p>



<h2>Overview</h2>



<p>The result is a Windows executable file. It’s a single .exe file that generates everything. It requires no resource file, no external depency, except for Windows and up-to-date drivers. </p>



<p>Here’s the quick summary of what we used. We’ll explain the details in the rest of the post.</p>



<ul>
<li>All the visuals are computed in real-time on the GPU, using GLSL shaders. This includes the timeline information, camera setup, etc.</li>



<li>The rendering is done with raymarching.</li>



<li>The shaders are minified using my own tool, <a href="https://github.com/laurentlb/shader_Minifier">Shader Minifier</a>.</li>



<li>The music was composed using <a href="https://openmpt.org/">OpenMPT</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/hzdgopher/4klang">4klang</a> synthesizer, which generates an assembly file able to replay the music. The instruments are described procedurally, while the list of notes is simply compressed.</li>



<li>The code was written in C++ using Visual Studio 2022.</li>



<li>To get started with the compiler flags and initialization, we used the <a href="https://github.com/armak/Leviathan-2.0/">Leviathan</a> framework.</li>



<li>The final output was compressed using <a href="https://github.com/runestubbe/Crinkler">Crinkler</a>.</li>
</ul>



<h2>Genesis</h2>



<p>One day, I saw a message from a former colleague, who shared a video he made a long time ago, called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khWXdkryBE4">Capoda</a>. I immediately loved the concept. The content is simple, yet it manages to tell a story efficiently.</p>



<p>I shared the link with some friends and thought it could be a good example of a story suitable for size coding. I was about to add this concept to the list of cool things I’ll probably never do, when Anatole replied:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>Looks like a perfect fit for 8kb ! Will you do it? I have always dreamed of making a prod like this, but I’m waiting for the “good and original idea”.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>I was excited by the project because I wanted to do more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene">demos</a> with story-telling and animations. At the same time, I was intrigued by the challenges of making something in 8kB: I usually <a href="https://64k-scene.github.io/">target 64kB</a>, which is a completely different world, with a different set of rules and challenges. For the music, I knew I could count on my old friend CyborgJeff. Anatole had a lot of experience with 4kB. With him, the project was much more likely to be successful. And that’s how we started working together. I was not certain it would be feasible to fit everything in 8kB, but there’s only one way to know, right?</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Why specifically 8kB? In the demoscene, there are multiple size categories, with 4kB and 64kB being very common. I’ve always enjoyed the techniques used in 4kB intros (an intro is a demo with a tight size limitation), but it always feels too limited for proper storytelling. Revision, the biggest demoparty in the world, added an 8kB competition a few years ago, so it was a good opportunity to try it.</p>
</blockquote>



<h2>Rendering Worlds with Two Triangles</h2>



<p>People familiar with the demoscene already know it, as this is <a href="https://iquilezles.org/articles/nvscene2008/rwwtt.pdf">a standard approach</a> since 2008: we draw a rectangle (so, two triangles) to cover the full screen. Then, we run a GPU program (called a shader) on the rectangle using the GLSL language. The program will compute a color for each pixel and each frame. All we need is a function that takes coordinates (and time) as input, and returns a color. Simple, right?</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/iQtWmNMHz0rgSV0z-HMtrOHo8vhG1GKz_DNnKAgqdyFf3p2rLQfUQC4YmTBGTAapBcxCEJ7l7-KBbYvWcjh7gsS5Z0aXvR_OOF1r9QJIAoWg5kIZe0gj67bBcwTkx2z4P7Li3ulRo6pe8Y0yOPNgGUc" alt=""><figcaption><br>“Please draw me a sheep!” — Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, The Little Prince</figcaption></figure>



<p>Of course, the big question is: how do we write a function that draws a sheep?</p>



<p>Let’s split the problem in two parts:</p>



<ol>
<li>Represent the scene as a signed distance field.</li>



<li>Use raymarching to convert the distance fields into pixels.</li>
</ol>



<h3>Signed Distance Fields (SDF)</h3>



<p>A distance field is a function that computes the distance between a point in space to the nearest object. For every point in space, we want to know how far the point is to the object. If a point is one the object’s surface, the function should return 0. This is a “signed” function, meaning that it will return a negative number for points inside the object.</p>



<p>In the most basic cases, the function is simple to write. For example, the distance between a point and a sphere is trivial to compute. For a cube, you can also do it in a couple of lines (see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62-pRVZuS5c">The SDF of a Box</a> for explanations). Lots of other building blocks have been documented. Inigo Quilez has a <a href="https://iquilezles.org/articles/distfunctions/">nice collection of simple reusable shapes</a> and the Mercury demo group also <a href="https://mercury.sexy/hg_sdf/">provides a great library</a>.</p>



<p>The true power of distance fields emerges when you combine them. To get the union of two objects, you can simply pick the minimum of the two distances, while the maximum gives the intersection. When crafting organic shapes, mathematical unions may appear coarse, but alternative formulas like the <a href="https://iquilezles.org/articles/smin/">smooth unions</a> can create more organic looks.</p>



<p>Once you have a toolset with building blocks, it feels like playing with legos to create an object or a scene. Thus we made our sheep by assembling simple shapes (for example a cone, a sphere) and merging them, while the body and wool consist of a 3D noise function.</p>



<p>The next task will be to actually render the distance function to the screen.</p>



<h3>Raymarching</h3>



<p>To draw the 3D scene on the screen, we use raymarching. Raymarching is a rendering technique that leverages SDFs to trace rays through a 3D scene. Unlike traditional ray tracing, which mathematically computes the intersection point, raymarching works by marching along the ray’s path. The SDF tells us how far we can walk without colliding with the scene. We can then move the ray origin and compute the new distance. We repeat the operation until the distance is 0 (or close to it).</p>



<p>In the image below, imagine that the ray origin is the camera. It is looking in a certain direction. After multiple iterations, we find the intersection point with the right wall.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/iaS66-fRMghoTXo-4spMNYhZl4iXq8mtt1lnNlSojpy_Ut-KCLIEZd5tiMBcBU7yp5ySH47Z_HJhJ2rH9N8sR8fydb43aa5J0hSrPVNZCLCjL0kqQoTZydu3ovgq91QbNtUS8FnGCjUfIt7Usfn1QKU" alt=""><figcaption>For more information, see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_marching#Sphere_tracing">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_marching#Sphere_tracing</a>.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Once we have the intersection point, we know if the current pixel should be a part of the sheep, the sky, or any other object. For the lighting, we need to know at least the surface normal, which we can <a href="https://iquilezles.org/articles/normalsSDF/">estimate by computing the gradient in the same area</a>. To compute shadows, we can send another ray for the point to the sun and find if an object is in between. Many techniques exist to improve the rendering quality beyond this basic idea.</p>



<p>To better understand the technical details, the tutorial “<a href="https://jamie-wong.com/2016/07/15/ray-marching-signed-distance-functions/">Ray Marching and Signed Distance Functions</a>” is a good start. If you have more time, the video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pdSjBPH3zM">Live Coding “Greek Temple”</a> is a wonderful in-depth example with detailed explanations.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/5a2r0IZxVgs4yLDfSoqmE56uIf0RIKD9Zubweu_PCWaPBgF9JdfopuYMYhhvUI1F6M0Weorsh42mnRF_GdDPTD3qqwLdN0wbJN6pAtC8Maj94oLBbS9u4e6wj-Xgn8ggP5PkAn20MuPIwctLyggvIZs" alt=""><figcaption>Early rendering</figcaption></figure>



<h2>Direction</h2>



<p>Imagine that you have to tell a story, but there is only one character, with no voice or written text, and that character is barely animated. It can only walk (but not turn!), move the head and the eyes. With only this, how would you tell a story and convey emotions?</p>



<p>When creating a demo with such a small size limit, it’s critical to know what is important. We avoided anything that didn’t serve that story. For example, we originally imagined the sheep walking in a desert. It wouldn’t be hard to generate dunes and a sky, but the story didn’t actually need it. We decided to keep the pure white background. We also skipped the textures, except for a few that convey a meaning (like the signs and the eyes).</p>



<p>Keeping the scope of the work relatively small allowed us to focus on things that might not be obvious at first: the details and the polish, the camera work, the editing, and the synchronization. Each shot was manually crafted, each animation was adjusted and went through many iterations to make sure the flow feels right. Not only did we need to make sure the flow felt right (adjusting the length of the shots and the sequencing), but it had to match the music.</p>



<p>To ensure that the narrative resonates with the audience, we employed a number of storytelling techniques, often with redundancy for emphasis. For example, to show the sheep’s excitement, we used cartoonish 2D effects, accelerated the walking pace, accentuated tail movements, exaggerated head swings, and added a dramatic shift in the music. This approach allowed us to convey a spectrum of emotions throughout the story.</p>



<p>The camera itself is also a storytelling tool. We used a wide shot to evoke a sense of solitude when the sheep wanders for hours; an extreme closeup on its eyes to capture the moment of realization when it notices the sign; and a slow zoom on the head to intensify the focus when the sheep stares at a sign.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/_jompACpAOizuHB2jEm7xIxqBx42TzshyggyYVHMv-lh4uqNDRZfsCcXcbmHyrqVP2md7scB-HLOwym-TZUJ2BpPwiqf4gKo3eDsF5ZGa2C2Kbvcu5LYkYk8MJakX8Ln2S92EaDHSco7EoBKbF0frxo" alt=""><figcaption>A 2D animated background was used to communicate the appeal of the flower.</figcaption></figure>







<h2>Development process</h2>



<p>You may notice that the source code contains a large number of hard-coded constants. The challenge was to determine these values — how large should the sheep’s eyes be? How fast should the camera move? How long should each shot last? What colors should the flower have?</p>



<p>Given this uncertainty, each constant went through numerous iterations. To iterate quickly and have a short feedback loop, shaders come in handy: we recompile them at runtime to update the graphics within a second.</p>



<p>The other requirement was to have a player: something that allows us to control the time with pause and replay commands. This proved to be invaluable when working on animations and camera control, as we could see the result instantly after a live-reload of the shader. Additionally, music support was a must, so that we can perfectly synchronize the animations to the music.<br>We designed our early prototypes in <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/">Shadertoy</a>, but we later transitioned to <a href="https://hexler.net/kodelife">KodeLife</a>, and finally moved the code to our own project (in C++, using a small framework called <a href="https://github.com/armak/Leviathan-2.0/">Leviathan</a>).</p>



<h2>Music</h2>



<p>Music is a critical component for storytelling. To fit the story, the music needed multiple parts, with different moods and transitions at specific points in time. We decided to use the same tools as we would in a 4kB intro, while allocating more space to allow a more intricate composition.</p>



<p>To compose the music, I asked my Cyborgjeff, a friend familiar with demoscene techniques, whose musical style resonated with our vision. His tool of choice was the <a href="https://github.com/hzdgopher/4klang">4klang synthesizer</a>, an impressive piece of software developed by Gopher. 4klang comes with a plugin usable from any music software and it has an export button that generates an assembly file. This file is then compiled and linked with the demo. When the demo runs, the synth will run in a separate thread, procedurally generate the wave sound, and send it to the soundcard.</p>



<p>Creating a small music comes with a lot of constraints. The first version of the music was bigger than expected. Imagine telling a musician “Your music is too big, can you reduce it by 500 bytes?” Well, that’s just normal in the demoscene.</p>



<p>We studied the output of 4klang to understand how it packs the data. With advice from Gopher, Cyborgjeff was able to iterate on the music to make it smaller. We made multiple adjustments:</p>



<ul>
<li>The number of instruments was reduced from 16 to 13.</li>



<li>The ending theme was recomposed to align with the tempo of the overall music.</li>



<li>The composition used more repetitions so it compresses better. For example, adjusting the length of a note in the background may be imperceptible to the ear while improving the compression ratio.</li>
</ul>



<p>This allowed us to save some space on the music, while keeping its overall structure, with a minimal loss in terms of quality. For more information on the music, Cyborgjeff wrote a blog post: <a href="https://www.studio-quena.be/cyborgjeff/blog/2023/04/11/8000-octets-un-mouton-et-une-fleur/">8000 octets, un mouton et une fleur</a>.</p>



<h2>Animation &amp; Synchronization</h2>



<p>Everything in the demo is re-evaluated at each frame as nothing is precomputed or cached. While this is really bad for the performance, this is a blessing for animations: anything can depend on the time and vary through the demo.</p>



<p>The demo consists of around 25 manually crafted camera shots. When creating a shot, we describe how each of <a href="https://github.com/ctrl-alt-test/mouton/blob/main/Intro/src/shaders/mouton.vert#L5-L22">18 parameters</a> varies over time, such as the position of each object, the state of the sheep, the position of the camera, the focal, what the camera is looking at, etc.</p>



<p>For example, a single line of code describes the camera during the shot:</p>



<pre><code>camPos = vec3(22., 2., time*0.6-10.);</code></pre>



<p>And we get a linear translation. Here “time” represents the time since the beginning of the shot so that we can easily insert, remove or adjust a shot without affecting the rest of the demo. Absolute times are avoided for code maintenance.</p>



<p>A note of caution on linear interpolations: while functional, they often look poor or robotic. In many cases, we apply the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoothstep">smoothstep</a> function, which leads to a smoother, more natural animation. Smoothstep is an S-shaped smooth interpolation that helps avoid sharp edges and sudden movement changes.<br>The code for the timeline is <a href="https://github.com/ctrl-alt-test/mouton/blob/main/Intro/src/shaders/mouton.vert#L53">in the vertex shader</a>. You may notice that each shot is defined in a similar way, and the code may seem redundant. It’s not a problem, as redundancy leads to better compression.</p>



<h2>Textures &amp; Materials</h2>



<p>In a traditional renderer, textures are 2D images that are applied on a 3D model. One difficulty with the textures is how to compute the texture coordinates and map each pixel in the texture to the 3D surface. With our raymarching approach, we can’t easily compute texture coordinates. Instead, we compute on the fly 3D textures. Once the raymarcher finds the 3D position of the point to render, we pass the 3D coordinates to the corresponding texture function.</p>

<p>Let’s take a look at the traffic signs. They use some math to compute a triangle or a square to serve as a border, then the inner content of the sign is achieved by <a href="https://github.com/ctrl-alt-test/mouton/blob/main/Intro/src/shaders/mouton.frag#L624">combining multiple functions</a>. For example, the restaurant symbol is created with 4 black oval-like shapes, and 2 white shapes are added to create the dents.</p>



<p>To make the visuals more interesting, we wanted to have not just textures, but also different materials. Parameters of the lighting equation depend on the material. For example, the sheep hooves have a different reflection (using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresnel_equations">fresnel coefficients</a>).</p>

<h2>Eyes</h2>



<p>For a long time during the development, the eyes looked dull and lifeless. I believe eyes are a big part of the character design. This was one of the first things that we animated, and it was very important as a tool for story-telling. Eyes help show feelings and they enable many transitions.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/QGyZLSEmC5EVpGPhOyH1W17dZBkbGqI106q_RYkEOPZsIEhp3IuSI5k1ILwOUqzjx68DswWkgaFM3geC_fsQpluilmWmGbYIGi_vfHYPsKdR8wNKBZY-2sY6ERgVMfNR6cYT83w2pxdLGqDK6EX-yDc" alt=""><figcaption>Early rendering</figcaption></figure>



<p>After searching for reference images on the Internet, I found that most of the cartoon characters have an iris, but the iris doesn’t seem to be strictly required.&nbsp; I’ve also noticed that the pupil is always big. If there’s an iris, the pupil will be big compared to the iris.</p>



<p>But the important part to get sparkling eyes is to have some reflections of the light in the eyes. With the standard lighting equations we used, we couldn’t get a reflection (unless the sun and the camera were at very specific positions). An input of the lighting equations is the normal vector of the surface. Our trick was to modify the vector to increase the probability of getting some reflections from the sun.</p>



<p>On top of that, we created an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_mapping">environment mapping</a>. This technique is commonly used in video games: instead of computing perfect reflections in the scene in real time, we can look up in a texture (that simulates the environment). Usually, people use environment mapping to optimize the code as the texture can be a simplification of the real environment. We did the opposite: our environment world is actually a perfect white, but we used a texture to fake and add details.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/beQPbrggllClDp6K168goj9fwyz_WQKed1Gc2cZBWC1lZfNCPj904WZ1xrMRg2BZayoZIGDGdrOD63gcfuci6c-nNATQ-wIiS4VdyD5dmbJkF-CQy_6gc4JMIPpdBmpdyzW_QD8UK2Au0YzKdnOH8Hk" alt=""><figcaption>Final result</figcaption></figure>



<p>The reflections in the eyes (both the white and the pupils) are much more complex than they should be in an empty world. There are multiple fake sources of lights, as well as a gradient (to mimic a darker ground and a blue-ish sky).</p>



<h2>Post-processing</h2>



<p>Once everything is done, the final visual touch defining the mood is the post-processing.</p>



<p>Despite being subtle, it helps have a good image quality and set the tone for the story.&nbsp; We used:</p>



<ul>
<li>color grading;</li>



<li>gamma correction;</li>



<li>a bit of vignetting;</li>



<li>finally, a two-pass FXAA filter to avoid aliasing (but you won’t notice it if you only watched the YouTube capture)</li>
</ul>



<p>We also implemented some of the effects in the post-processing step, such as the stars in the eyes or the ending screen effect. Those are made as pure 2D and don’t exist in the 3D world.</p>



<p>Finally, we experimented with other alternative styles. At some point, we tried to give an old-cartoon look, and we implemented contour detection to simulate a hand-drawn image, with a monochrome rendering, grain, and noise. The result looked like this:</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/l8g7w28ukmvnB9lO6UauAk76tzbtbgv_uwRjEiAouIcA4KDgwCeVYhTeVeAcsjSXK7FN6kJVtA7r3Ka7dPMJGeY3zB4Xvg4z1WGnPovluXJZ9D9iC1QLW5mp8DXywamC2zHaJv_T_RAnILcbDoFXRbg" alt=""></figure>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/bG6HYJcungIAKm9LFHBNJCIYlCtGCL1zI2pOLX2Hfc7IP0mUOst90cRbXCZQABuAUXKyxZrpbSILNHwzMIaUoqXOGISLV-rafoX2SMHDrN0se6gCpouoR7JFuctXRo66zRr-LvK1nZP--NqESc9OKIQ" alt=""></figure>



<p>After discussions, we decided to give up on this experiment and focus on the cleaner, modern look.</p>



<h2>Compression</h2>



<p>So far, we’ve seen how we made most of the demo. The main idea is to avoid storing data, instead we use code to describe how to generate the data. For the music, we store a list of notes to play, as well as a list of instructions for each instrument. All of this is relatively small, but does it really fit in 8kB?</p>



<p>Part of the magic comes from <a href="https://github.com/runestubbe/Crinkler">Crinkler</a>, a compression tool specifically designed for the demoscene and intros between 1kB and 8kB. As the executable needs to be self-extractible, Crinkler includes some very small and clever assembly code that can decompress the rest of the executable. It’s optimized for size at the expense of other things: the compression algorithm takes a while, the decompression is relatively slow and uses a lot of RAM (hundreds of megabytes).</p>



<p>Crinkler is an impressive tool, but it doesn’t do everything. We have a total of <a href="https://github.com/ctrl-alt-test/mouton/tree/main/Intro/src/shaders">42kB of shader source code</a> and we need one last ingredient to fit it in the binary.</p>



<h2>Minification</h2>



<p>As the shader source code is included in the final binary, we have to make it as small as possible. It would be possible to minify the code by hand, but then it would cause maintenance issues. It was critical for the success of our project to be able to iterate quickly, without worrying about low-level size optimizations. So we needed a tool to minify the shader.</p>



<p>I have written such a tool, <a href="https://github.com/laurentlb/Shader_Minifier/">Shader Minifier</a>, which has been a side project of mine since 2011. It removes unneeded spaces and comments, it renames variables and can do more. It has been the most popular shader minification tool in the demoscene for many years, but this was not sufficient for us: an 8kB intro contains much more code than a 4kB does, and new problems arise from the larger code size.</p>



<p>I stopped working on the demo for one month to implement all the missing features we needed from Shader Minifier. While it’s easy to write a simple minifier, you need to write a compiler if you want to get good minification — a source-to-source compiler, similar to what Closure Compiler does.</p>



<p>The full <a href="https://github.com/laurentlb/Shader_Minifier/?tab=readme-ov-file#transformations">list of transformations</a> supported by Shader Minifier is getting quite long, but here are a few:</p>



<ul>
<li>Renaming of variables and functions</li>



<li>Inlining of variables</li>



<li>Evaluation of constant arithmetic</li>



<li>Inlining of functions</li>



<li>Dead code elimination</li>



<li>Merging of declarations</li>
</ul>



<p>These transformations reduce the size of the output, but it’s not enough. We need to make sure that the output is compression-friendly. This is a hard problem: it can happen that a transformation reduces the size of the code, while increasing the size of the compressed code. So we constantly need to monitor the compressed size, as we iterate on the demo.</p>



<p>New improvements to Shader Minifier have saved around 600 bytes on the compressed binary. To help review and monitor what exactly goes in the final binary, we store <a href="https://github.com/ctrl-alt-test/mouton/blob/main/Intro/src/shaders/shaders.inl">the minified output</a> in the repository. This proved useful to identify new optimization opportunities. At the end, once minified and compressed, the 42kB of shader code fits in about 5kB, which gives just enough space for the music and the C++ code.</p>



<p>Anyway… you could say that I had to write a compiler in order to make this demo. :)</p>



<h2>The War Between the Sheep and the Flowers</h2>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s not important, the war between the sheep and the flowers? […] Suppose I happen to know a unique flower, one that exists nowhere in the world except on my planet, one that a little sheep can wipe out in a single bite one morning, just like that, without even realizing what he’d doing – that isn’t important? If someone loves a flower of which just one example exists among all the millions and millions of stars, that’s enough to make him happy when he looks at the stars. He tells himself ‘My flower’s up there somewhere…’ But <strong>if the sheep eats the flower, then for him it’s as if, suddenly, all the stars went out</strong>. And that isn’t important?”</p>



<p>— Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, The Little Prince</p>
</blockquote>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>As you’ve seen, there are lots of advanced and fascinating techniques needed to make this kind of demo. But we didn’t invent everything. We’re building on top of what other people did. The amount of work and research that was done by other people is incredible, from the raymarching techniques, to the music generation software and the compression algorithms. Hopefully the new features added to Shader Minifier will help other people create better demos in the future. The 8kB category is fun and offers more possibilities than the 4kB category; let’s hope it will become more popular.</p>



<p>P.S. For comparison, the text of this article contains around 21,000 characters, so it would take 21kB.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://zed.dev/blog/zed-is-now-open-source">https://zed.dev/blog/zed-is-now-open-source</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39119835">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><header></header><div><figure><img src="https://zed.dev/img/post/zed-is-now-open-source/open-source-F1.png" alt=""></figure></div>
<p>We're excited to announce that Zed is now an open source project. The code for Zed itself will be made available under a copyleft license to ensure any improvements will benefit the entire community (GPL for the editor, AGPL for server-side components). GPUI, the UI framework that powers Zed, will be distributed under the Apache 2 license, so that you can use it to build high-performance desktop applications and distribute them under any license you choose.</p>
<h2 id="motivations"><span data-br=":Rlquuuujf9la:" data-brr="1">Motivations</span></h2>
<p>Why are we doing this? Most importantly, we believe that making Zed open source will make it the best product. Our mission is to build the world's most advanced code editor and get it into the hands of millions of developers. There's a ton of surface area on that problem, and we'll need all the help we can get. Considering that all of Zed's users are programmers, it makes the most sense sense to open Zed to the maximum pool of talent.</p>
<p>On a more selfish level, we also think going open source will be a lot more fun. One of our favorite aspects of software is connecting with people. We're not only proud of <em>what</em> we've built, but also of <em>how</em> we've built it. We want to share Zed's inner beauty with all of you, and we're confident we'll learn a lot from you in the process to make it even better.</p>
<h2 id="introducing-fireside-hacks"><span data-br=":R1dquuuujf9la:" data-brr="1">Introducing <em>Fireside Hacks</em></span></h2>
<p>Motivated by our desire to connect with you all on a human level, we're launching a new Zed feature called Zed Channels, which will make it easy for developers anywhere in the world to write code together in real time just by sharing a link.</p>
<p>Starting tomorrow, we'll be using Channels to run a new program called <em>Fireside Hacks</em>, in which we'll be streaming into a public channel regularly we work on Zed live with whoever shows up. We'll be experimenting with different formats, but we're hoping these regular sessions give us all an opportunity to get to know each other better, beyond what's possible in a static pull request. Come join the experiment to ask questions, make suggestions, and code with us in real time. We're looking forward to meeting you!</p>
<h2 id="wait-doesnt-cash-rule-everything-around-me"><span data-br=":R25quuuujf9la:" data-brr="1">Wait... Doesn't Cash Rule Everything Around Me?</span></h2>
<p>We strongly believe that the best way to build and maintain the world's best editor is by associating it with a sustainable business model. It's the only way we can continue to invest in a full-time team to spearhead development. Some may wonder whether making Zed open source undermines this objective. We've thought about this a lot, and we don't think that openness is at odds with commercial success.</p>
<p>Rather than selling you a proprietary editor, we'd much prefer to sell you services that seamlessly integrate with your editor to make you and your team more productive. Zed Channels is one example of such a service. It's free for anyone today, but we intend to begin charging for private use after a beta period of experimentation. Providing server-side compute to power AI features is another monetization scheme we're seeing getting traction.</p>
<p>Today, we're open sourcing 100% of the code we've written so far. In the future, however, we may still offer proprietary products targeting commercial and enterprise use cases, though we always intend for proprietary code to be a tiny fraction compared to the code we open source. We also intend to ensure our need to generate revenue never interferes with your need to write software. We're never going to show you a banner ad in your code editor, and if we do, you can always build Zed from source.</p>
<p>We believe in the principle of creating more value than we capture. Going open source is a bet that if we can build a huge movement around Zed, our company will find opportunities to capture some of the value we create.</p>
<h2 id="the-road-to-10"><span data-br=":R3dquuuujf9la:" data-brr="1">The Road to 1.0</span></h2>
<p>So what's next? To some extent, that's up to you! But it's also true that we're still a small team. We want to massively grow adoption in 2024 so that more developers can benefit from Zed, and we've put together a public roadmap based on user feedback that we think can help us get there. If your contributions help us make progress toward completing that roadmap, especially items near the top, we'll be more likely to make time for them.</p>
<p>That said, we're going to figure this out as we go, and we welcome anyone who is excited to contribute and learn. If you'd like to get involved, check out our <a href="https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md">contribution guide</a>, and come say hello at an upcoming Fireside Hack if you have the time. Developers everywhere need a better code editor, and we're excited for you to join us on our mission to advance the state of the art. See you in the codebase!</p><hr></article></div></div>]]></description>
