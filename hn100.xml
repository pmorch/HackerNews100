<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A world-beating deposit of <a href="https://www.chemistryworld.com/3005835.article" rel="intextlink_6">lithium</a> along the Nevada–Oregon border could meet surging demand for this metal, according to a new analysis.</p>
<p>An estimated 20 to 40 million tonnes of lithium metal lie within a volcanic crater formed around 16 million years ago. This is notably larger than the lithium deposits found beneath a Bolivian salt flat, previously considered the largest deposit in the world.</p>
<p>‘If you believe their back-of-the-envelope estimation, this is a very, very significant deposit of lithium,’ says <a href="https://www.kuleuven.be/wieiswie/en/person/00143067">Anouk Borst</a>, a geologist at KU Leuven University and the Royal Museum for Central Africa in Tervuren, Belgium. ‘It could change the dynamics of lithium globally, in terms of price, security of supply and geopolitics.’</p>
<p>New in situ analysis reveals that an unusual claystone, composed of the mineral illite, contains 1.3% to 2.4% of lithium in the volcanic crater. This is almost double the lithium present in the main lithium-bearing clay mineral, <a href="https://www.chemistryworld.com/3005842.article" rel="intextlink_3">magnesium</a> smectite, which is more common than illite.</p>
<p>Some unusual conditions created what could be a uniquely rich volcanic deposit. The crater – the McDermitt caldera – formed 16.4 million years ago when around 1000km<sup>3</sup> of magma exploded outwards. The caldera was filled with erupted products of an alkaline magma rich in <a href="https://www.chemistryworld.com/3005954.article" rel="intextlink_5">sodium</a> and <a href="https://www.chemistryworld.com/3005912.article" rel="intextlink_4">potassium</a>, as well as lithium, <a href="https://www.chemistryworld.com/3005734.article" rel="intextlink_1">chlorine</a> and <a href="https://www.chemistryworld.com/3005716.article" rel="intextlink_0">boron</a>. This quickly cooled to form a finely crystalline glassy volcanic rock, ignimbrite, which weathered to produce lithium-rich particles.</p>
<p>A lake subsequently formed in the crater, persisting for hundreds of thousands of years, with weathered volcanic and surrounding materials forming a clay-rich sediment at its bottom. The new analysis suggested that, after the lake had emptied, another bout of volcanism exposed the sediments to a hot, alkaline brine, rich in lithium and potassium.</p>

</div>
<p>‘Previous research assumed that the illite was everywhere at depth in the caldera,’ says Thomas Benson, a geologist at Lithium Americas Corporation, and was formed when high temperatures and pressures turned smectite to illite.</p>
<p>Benson’s team proposed that a layer of illite around 40m thick was formed in the lake sediments by this hot brine. The fluid moved upwards along fractures formed as volcanic activity restarted, transforming smectite into illite in the southern part of the crater, Thacker Pass. The result was a claystone rich in lithium.</p>
<p>‘This would be a multistep alteration of lithium-bearing smectite to illite, where hydrothermal fluids enriched the clays in potassium, lithium and <a href="https://www.chemistryworld.com/3005779.article" rel="intextlink_2">fluorine</a>,’ says Borst. ‘They seem to have hit the sweet spot where the clays are preserved close to the surface, so they won’t have to extract as much rock, yet it hasn’t been weathered away yet.’</p>
<p>The material could be best described as looking ‘a bit like brown potter’s clay’, says <a href="https://nbmg.unr.edu/staff/henry.html">Christopher Henry</a>, emeritus professor of geology at the University of Nevada in Reno. ‘It is extremely uninteresting, except that it has so much lithium in it.’</p>
<p>‘There’s been a lot of searching for additional [lithium] deposits,’ Henry adds. ‘The United States has just one small lithium-producing brine operation in Nevada.’</p>
<div data-attachment="528639" data-sequence="2">

</div>
<p>Henry does not wholly agree with the newly proposed history of the crater, since isotopic dating showed that a lake existed there until 15.7 million years ago, but the volcanic system went extinct by 16.1 million years. The new timeline would require volcanic activity for longer than the evidence suggests, he explains.</p>
<p>Benson says his company expects to begin mining in 2026. It will remove clay with water and then separate out the small lithium-bearing grains from larger minerals by centrifuging. The clay will then be leached in vats of sulfuric acid to extract lithium.</p>
<p>‘If they can extract the lithium in a very low energy intensive way, or in a process that does not consume much acid, then this can be economically very significant,’ says Borst. ‘The US would have its own supply of lithium and industries would be less scared about supply shortages.’</p>
<p>Benson views the lithium-rich claystone at Thacker Pass as ‘unique’ amongst volcanic sedimentary deposits. ‘Smectite clays are relatively more abundant,’ he says. Exploration for further lithium deposits following eruptions should focus on calderas with lake sediments that have been hydrothermally altered in lakes with no outflows, he adds.</p></div></div>]]></description>

															<p>Spying on people’s behavior and profiling them is wrong. That is why we have made sure that Google’s Topics is disabled in two separate ways in the Vivaldi browser. </p>

<div><p>And this is simply ridiculous. Topics, a part of <a href="https://privacysandbox.com/">Chrome Privacy Sandbox</a>, is something we have long known as a deceitful attempt by Google to appear to be privacy-oriented while introducing new means of spying on their users.</p><p>In short: Topics is among Google’s attempts to replace the third-party cookie as a means of identifying people online by striking a balance between preserving people’s privacy and preserving companies’ abilities to buy and sell targeted ads.&nbsp;</p></div>



<div><p>From the moment they started developing it, we have voiced our concerns about this — whether it was <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/03/googles-floc-terrible-idea">Floc</a> or Topics, and have sought to fully disable it in Vivaldi.  We never had any faith in the Topics API from the very start. </p><p>Read our <a href="https://vivaldi.com/blog/technology/heads-up-googles-going-off-topics-again/">blog</a> when Topics was announced. </p></div>



<h2>Google’s Topics disabled in Vivaldi.</h2>



<p>Google’s Topics API will not be enabled in Vivaldi, and it cannot work in Vivaldi. It would need two things to make it work, and we have disabled both of them.</p>







<ol>
<li>It would need a setting enabled for it to collect local profiles about you. We disable the setting by default, and we forcibly do it in a way that means that changes to Chromium cannot remotely enable it. We do not provide any settings UI to allow you to change it, and we will soon remove the new Chromium settings section for it. (Technically, you could enable it by editing your settings or installing an extension that manipulates it. However, all that would do is enable&nbsp;<strong>local</strong>&nbsp;data collection. It will not be used because of #2)<br></li>



<li>Before exposing the <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/en/docs/privacy-sandbox/topics/overview/#:~:text=The%20Topics%20API%20is%20a,the%20sites%20a%20user%20visits.">Topics API</a> information to websites, Chromium checks if the setting is enabled or disabled. We forcibly make it always return “disabled”, even if it is enabled. So that even if you somehow manage to bypass #1 and enable local profile collection, it will not expose it to Google or other websites.<br></li>
</ol>



<h2>Do you really want to be tracked? </h2>



<p>Did you ever imagine a browser that has user-tracking and ad platforms baked in? That’s Google Chrome for you. Google says it will block third-party cookies in the second half of 2024  — presumably after it makes sure the “Privacy Sandbox” will allow it to keep its profits. </p>



<div><p>We believe that having tracking and profiling baked into a browser is fundamentally wrong. Even if it can be disabled, and even if it is disabled by default but allows you to enable it on demand. Users should not be exposed to this sort of privacy invasion, and the browser should be protecting you from it.</p><p>The world’s largest tech companies generate most of their revenues from advertising, and when that advertising is driven by your data and interactions with their services, the balance is very wrong.</p><p>But at the same time, there are companies out there that have genuinely good intentions as well. As we’ve said before, what happens next is up to all of us — all of you. It all depends on what choices we make. </p><p>Our mission is to stay true to our users and respect their privacy, and we shall continue to do so. </p></div>



<div><p>Thank you, Topics. You have made our relationship with our users stronger. </p><p><em>Input from Yngve Pettersen and Julien Picalausa</em></p></div>

<p dir="auto">While this is a "DIY" open-source project, it is not yet a mature plug-and-play project. If you intend to build your own, note that it requires advanced soldering experience to build - very small-pitch surface-mount soldering is required (reflow or hot air recommended), and assembly is quite time-consuming and delicate. Please go into it with the expectation that you will almost certainly need to be able to troubleshoot some hardware and firmware issues yourself - I recommend reviewing/understanding the schematics and basic firmware before jumping in!</p>

<p dir="auto">A few miscellaneous notes in the meantime:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>There's limited space inside the LCD mount for wiring, and 8 wires need to fit through the hole in the center. I used 30 AWG wire-wrapping wire. Enamel-coated wire would probably work too.</li>
<li>Older versions of the design (as seen in the videos) used glued-on BF350-3AA strain gauges to detect presses; in v0.5 these were replaced with footprints for SMD resistors, which exhibit similar properties when stretched/compressed and are much easier to assemble.</li>
<li>The TMC6300 is <em>tiny</em> and has a bottom pad, so I would seriously consider getting a stencil along with the PCB order. Even with the stencil I needed to manually clean up some bridging afterward; I <em>highly</em> recommend Chip Quik NC191 gel flux, available on <a href="https://amzn.to/3MGDSr5" rel="nofollow">Amazon</a> (or use this <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Smooth-Flow-No-Clean-syringe-plunger/dp/B08KJPG3NZ" rel="nofollow">non-affiliate link</a> instead) or from your electronics distributor of choice. Flux is also very helpful when soldering the LCD ribbon cable to to screen PCB.</li>
<li>For breadboard prototyping, the <a href="https://www.trinamic.com/support/eval-kits/details/tmc6300-bob/" rel="nofollow">TMC6300-BOB</a> or SparkFun's <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/21867" rel="nofollow">TMC6300 driver board</a> are awesome and way easier to work with than the bare chip if you just want to play around with low current BLDC motors</li>
<li>For AliExpress purchases: I highly recommend <strong>only</strong> using AliExpress Standard Shipping (purchasing in the US). I have had multiple purchases take months or never get delivered when purchased with Cainiao or other low cost shipping options, whereas AliExpress Standard is very reliable and generally faster in my experience.</li>
<li>Make sure to check the <a href="https://github.com/scottbez1/smartknob/issues">open issues</a> - this design is not yet "stable", so beware that everything may not go smoothly. I would not recommend ordering these parts yourself until the <a href="https://github.com/scottbez1/smartknob/milestone/1">stable release v1.0 milestone</a> is complete, as there are some mechanical interference issues in the current revision.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Future plans:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>consider switch to using an ESP32-S3-MINI-1 module</li>
<li>get wifi configured and working (probably MQTT?). Currently memory is an issue with the full display framebuffer sprite. PSRAM might fix this (requires newer ESP-IDF &amp; unreleased Arduino core, and from a brief test I got horrible performance with PSRAM enabled), or the next item might help reduce memory:</li>
<li>migrate to LVGL, for better display rendering and easy support for menus, etc. Shouldn't require a full 240x240x24b framebuffer in memory, freeing some for wifi, etc.</li>
<li>Home Assistant integration, or other real-world applications</li>
<li>???</li>

<p dir="auto">Ordering notes: use white soldermask, for reflecting light from RGB LED ring around the knob. Should be 1.2mm thick (not "standard" 1.6mm).</p>
<p dir="auto">If you are ordering a stencil for solder paste from JLCPCB and plan to apply paste by hand (as
<a href="https://youtu.be/Q76dMggUH1M?t=372" rel="nofollow">shown in the video</a>) without a stencil frame/machine, make sure to select
<strong>"Customized size"</strong> and enter smaller dimensions (e.g. 100mm x 100mm) to avoid getting a much larger stencil than you
need. This will also likely reduce the cost of shipping substantially! Also, select only the <strong>Top</strong> side; the bottom
only has 2 SMT components - the motor connector and VEML7700 ALS - so it's not worth getting a stencil for that.</p>

<p dir="auto">There are few enough components on the Screen PCB that I chose to hand-solder them rather than reflow with solder paste
and a stencil, but if you order a stencil, see the note above about selecting a "Customized size" to be easier to
handle and save on shipping. Also make sure to select the <strong>Bottom</strong> side only; all the components are on the bottom
side of the screen PCB.</p>

<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Printed parts</h4>
<p dir="auto">You will need six printed parts. The current stable designs can be found as STL assets in the <a href="https://github.com/scottbez1/smartknob/releases/tag/releases%2Fmechanical%2Fv185-dummy-tag">v185 mechanical release</a> or you can export the latest untested designs from the CAD model by opening it in Fusion 360: <a href="https://a360.co/3BzkU0n" rel="nofollow">https://a360.co/3BzkU0n</a></p>
<p dir="auto">The parts can <em>probably</em> be FDM 3D printed with a well-tuned printer, but the parts shown in videos/photos were MJF printed in nylon for tight tolerances and better surface finish.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you wanted a simpler build, you could omit the LCD and just merge the knob + glass from the model into a single STL to get a closed-top knob.</p>
<p dir="auto">Export and print the following 6 parts:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>Enclosure</code></li>
<li><code>Knob</code> (RotorAssembly-&gt;KnobAssembly-&gt;Knob)</li>
<li><code>ScreenPlatform</code></li>
<li><code>RotorSpacer</code> (RotorAssembly-&gt;RotorSpacer)</li>
<li><code>MountBase</code></li>
<li><code>BackPlate</code></li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><g-emoji alias="warning">⚠️</g-emoji> If you opt to go for MJF Nylon printing from JLCPCB, their system may complain about <code>&lt; 0.8mm wall thickness detected</code> on the <code>MountBase</code>, <code>ScreenPlatform</code> and <code>RotorSpacer</code> parts. This appears to be a false positive, possibly on some of the print tapers. You should be able to ignore this, as all print orders at JLCPCB are subject to a final manual review, and they will contact you by email if there are any job-stopping issues or risks with your prints.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">NanoFOC (3rd party)</h2>
<p dir="auto">If you're looking to tinker with FOC/haptic feedback, but don't want to build a full SmartKnob View yourself, I can
recommend the NanoFOC DevKit++, an <a href="https://github.com/katbinaris/nanofoc_devkit">open-source design</a> made and
<a href="https://store.binaris.io/products/nanofoc-devkit" rel="nofollow">sold</a> by a member of the SmartKnob community! It's super compact
and is a great testbed or core for building your own BLDC-based haptic input device.</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>
<p dir="auto"><strong>How much does it cost?</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">I wish I could tell you now, but I don't actually know off the top of my head. Check back soon - I've only built a few so far, which was the result of a bunch of tinkering and prototyping over an extended period, so I don't have all the expenses tallied up yet. Probably less than $200 in parts? But some items have gotten more expensive, and you may be limited by minimum order quantities or shipping charges from multiple separate suppliers.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Does it work with XYZ?</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Not yet, regardless of whatever "XYZ" you're thinking of. So far I've only implemented enough firmware for the demo shown in the video, so you can't actually use it for anything productive yet. The basic detent configuration API is there, but not much else. Lots of firmware work remains to be done. If you build one, I'd love your help adding support for "XYZ" though!</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Can I buy one as a kit or already assembled?</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Probably not? Or at least, I don't have any immediate plans to sell them myself. It's not that I don't want you to be happy, but hardware is a hard business and I just work on this stuff in my free time.</p>
<p dir="auto">It's open source with a fairly permissive license though, so in theory anyone could start offering kits/assemblies. If someone does go down that route of selling them, note that attribution is
<em>required</em> (and I wouldn't say no to <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/scottbez1/">royalties/tips/thanks</a> if you're in a giving mood 🙂).</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">General Component Info</h2>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Magnetic encoders</h3>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">MT6701 (MagnTek)</h4>
<p dir="auto">Excellent sensor at a reasonable price - highly recommended. Less noisy than TLV493D, and more responsive (control loop is more stable) using SSI.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Lots of IO options - SSI, I2C, and ABZ - should offer good response latency</li>
<li>SSI includes CRC to validate data</li>
<li>No power-down or low-power options - may not be ideal for battery-powered devices</li>
<li>Not available from US distributors (Mouser, Digi-Key)</li>
</ul>

<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">TLV493D (Infineon)</h4>
<p dir="auto">Not used in the SmartKnob view, but a common/popular magnetic encoder in general. It's a mediocre choice for a haptic feedback implementation. Easy to prototype with using <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/4366" rel="nofollow">Adafruit's QWIIC breakout board</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">In my testing, it's noisy, requiring filtering/smoothing that can slow responsiveness, hurting control loop stability. Or, with less filtering, the noise
can easily be "amplified" by the derivative component in the PID motor torque controller, causing audible (and tactile) humming/buzzing.</p>
<p dir="auto">But the bigger issue is that there is apparently a known silicon issue that causes the internal ADC to sometimes completely lock up, requiring a full reset and re-configuration, which can cause delays/gaps in data! See section
5.6 in the <a href="https://www.infineon.com/dgdl/Infineon-TLV493D-A1B6_3DMagnetic-UM-v01_03-EN.pdf?fileId=5546d46261d5e6820161e75721903ddd" rel="nofollow">User Manual</a></p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="In the Master Controlled Mode (MCM) or the Fast Mode (FM) the ADC conversion may hang up. A hang up can
be detected by:
 - Frame Counter (FRM) counter stucks and does not increment anymore."><pre><code>In the Master Controlled Mode (MCM) or the Fast Mode (FM) the ADC conversion may hang up. A hang up can
be detected by:
 - Frame Counter (FRM) counter stucks and does not increment anymore.
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">In my experience testing 4 different Adafruit breakout boards, 2 of them (50%) regularly exhibit this lockup behavior within a minute or two of use. It is possible to detect and auto-reset (and there is code in the project to do so), but it is slow and may cause undesirable jumps/delays if the sensor locks up often.</p>

<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">AS5600 (AMS)</h4>
<p dir="auto">A mediocre choice. Cheap breakout boards are readily available.</p>
<p dir="auto">In my testing, it's fairly noisy (anecdotally, noisier than the TLV493d), requiring filtering/smoothing that can slow responsiveness, hurting control loop stability. Additionally, it saturates at a lower magnetic field strength than other sensors I tested, requiring a significant air gap (8-10mm) when used with a strong neodymium diametric magnet like <a href="https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/radial-magnets-inc/8995/5126077" rel="nofollow">Radial Magnets 8995</a>.</p>

<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Motor drivers</h3>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">TMC6300-LA</h4>
<p dir="auto">This is a relatively new IC and it's a perfect match! There generally aren't any other drivers (with integrated fets) that meet the requirements for the low-voltage and low-current motors used in this project (DRV8316 might work, but has not been tested).</p>
<p dir="auto">Highlights:</p>

<li>5.9mm hollow shaft</li>
<li>built-in diametric magnet for encoder</li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>There is a common sentiment I’ve seen over and over in the Rust community that I think is ignorant at best and harmful at worst.</p>

<p>This blogpost is largely a response to <a href="https://bitbashing.io/async-rust.html">this post</a> by Matt Kline, but I’ve seen this kind of sentiment all over the Rust community. I’ve found that, in almost every case where <code>async</code>/<code>await</code> is mentioned, at least one person says this. It always gets on my nerves a little bit.</p>

<p>The guilty phrase is as follows: “<code>async</code> rust is only useful for a small number of programs, so why do library authors insist on using it in their APIs?”</p>

<p>I can understand where this kind of thinking comes from. Especially for newer Rustaceans, <code>async</code>/<code>await</code> is quite a bit of complexity up front. But, I think actively shying away from <code>async</code> is the wrong way to go.</p>

<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> I am one of the maintainers for <a href="https://crates.io/crates/smol"><code>smol</code></a>, a small and fast <code>async</code> runtime for Rust. So, obviously, I am somewhat biased. However, I think that <code>async</code> can be cool, small and fun; it’s just the presence of complicated <code>async</code> code used commonly across the ecosystem that scared people off.</p>

<h2 id="why-async">Why async?</h2>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenspun%27s_tenth_rule">Greenspun’s tenth rule</a> comes to mind quite often. For those unfamiliar, Greenspun’s tenth rule of programming is that every sufficiently complicated program contains a bug-ridden version of half of Common Lisp. Likewise, there are a worrying number of Rust programs that contain a bug-ridden version of half of an <code>async</code> runtime.</p>

<p>I call this “poor man’s <code>async</code>”. <code>async</code>/<code>await</code> is a natural pattern for doing multiple things at once; usually, non-<code>async</code> code tends to evolve into something closer and closer to <code>async</code> code, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinisation">carcinisation</a>. It’s all over the place in the Rust ecosystem, once you start looking for it.</p>

<p>It happens like this: programs are naturally complicated. Even the simple, Unix-esque atomic programs can’t help but do two or three things at once. Okay, now you set it up so, instead of waiting on <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/read.2.html"><code>read</code></a> or <a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/accept.2.html"><code>accept</code></a> or whatnot, you register your file descriptors into <a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/poll.2.html"><code>poll</code></a> and wait on that, then switching on the result of <a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/poll.2.html"><code>poll</code></a> to figure out what you actually want to do.</p>

<p>Eventually, two or three sockets becomes a hundred, or even an unlimited amount. Guess it’s time to bring in <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/epoll.7.html"><code>epoll</code></a>! Or, if you want to be cross-platform, it’s now time to write a wrapper around that, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kqueue"><code>kqueue</code></a> and, if you’re brave, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/i-o-completion-ports">IOCP</a>.</p>

<p>Great, now you need a way to organize all of this work, because switching on it means you have to add two hundred lines to your program every time you want to handle some other corner case. No problem, let’s set up a queue of tasks. Whoops, turns out that queueing strategy is inefficient. Better make a new one. Let’s hope it’s thread safe!</p>

<p>At the end of this process, you’ve re-invented <a href="https://crates.io/crates/async-io"><code>async-io</code></a> and <a href="https://crates.io/crates/async-executor"><code>async-executor</code></a>, two of the core components of <a href="https://crates.io/crates/smol"><code>smol</code></a>.</p>

<p>This isn’t a knock on anyone in particular; this is a knock on me too! I’ve written quite a few Rust projects where I expect it to only involve blocking primitives, only to find out that, actually, I’m starting to do a lot of things at once, guess I’d better use <code>async</code>. The original <code>async</code> setup at the beginning of the project is somewhat annoying, but it’s a walk in the park compared to going back and rewriting my entire program setup to use <code>async</code>/<code>await</code>.</p>

<p>The point being, many people say that only five percent of Rust projects use <code>async</code>, and the remaining ninety-five percent have to put up with it. I disagree. Many of the remaining ninety-five percent (if that is an accurate number) are currently using <code>async</code>/<code>await</code>; they just haven’t admitted it yet!</p>

<h2 id="why-dont-people-like-async">Why don’t people like async?</h2>

<p>Now here’s where I speculate <em>why</em> this attitude is so pervasive in the Rust community. I personally think it’s a combination of poor advertising on the part of <code>async</code> combined with poor standard library support.</p>

<p>I’d argue that, if you walked up to your average Rustacean on the street and asked what they thought of <code>async</code> programming, they’d argue that it’s just a obtuse, niche way to create web servers.</p>

<p>That’s not true! Even if you ignore the benefits of using <code>async</code> from a network clients, you can still definitely use <code>async</code> for desktop apps. <a href="https://crates.io/crates/async-winit"><code>async-winit</code></a> is my attempt at bringing <code>async</code>/<code>await</code> to desktop apps in a managable way. I just think that too many people see <code>async</code>/<code>await</code> as part of Rust’s whole web shindig, instead of a reasonable way to structure highly concurrent applications.</p>

<p>In addition, the standard library is definitely built around synchronous code first and <code>async</code> code second. This means that a lot of <code>async</code> code that <em>should</em> be in the standard library ends up being pushed into external crates. This is definitely a problem that, thankfully, is being fixed as traits like <a href="https://docs.rs/futures-core/latest/futures_core/stream/trait.Stream.html"><code>Stream</code></a> are now finally making their way into <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/async_iter/trait.AsyncIterator.html">the standard library</a>.</p>

<p>Even if you’re writing one of the simple programs that doesn’t explicitly need <code>async</code>/<code>await</code>, it’s not too difficult to move between the two worlds. <a href="https://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2015/02/01/what-color-is-your-function/">Function colors</a> get brought up a lot in this area of debate. However, personally, I find it much easier to go from <code>async</code> to sync and vice versa than JavaScript does. For instance, to run an <code>async</code> function in synchronous code, you can bring in the zero-dependency <a href="https://crates.io/crates/pollster"><code>pollster</code></a> crate and run this:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>use</span> <span>pollster</span><span>::</span><span>FutureExt</span> <span>as</span> <span>_</span><span>;</span>

<span>async</span> <span>{</span> <span>"Hello world!"</span> <span>}</span><span>.block_on</span><span>();</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Likewise, to run sync code in the <code>async</code> world, it’s usually easy to spawn it onto a <a href="https://crates.io/crates/blocking"><code>blocking</code></a> task and then poll it from <code>async</code> code. There’s some thread-safety subtlety I’m papering over here, but overall it looks something like this:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>blocking</span><span>::</span><span>unblock</span><span>(||</span> <span>"Hello world!"</span><span>)</span><span>.await</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Another benefit of <code>async</code>/<code>await</code> that I don’t know how to bring up organically above: it translates a lot better to web targets. Blocking synchronous code isn’t allowed in WASM in browsers, so by using <code>async</code> code, you can be reasonably sure that your algorithm can be ported to the web very easily.</p>

<p>Generally, <code>async</code>/<code>await</code> makes things more portable and easier to work into different application setups. I think that, if more Rustaceans invested the effort into learning how <code>async</code>/<code>await</code> ticks, we’d see it used in much more programs.</p>

<h2 id="keeping-the-faith">Keeping the Faith</h2>

<p>I’ve been dancing around it for too long, let’s finally dive into <a href="https://bitbashing.io/async-rust.html">this post</a>.</p>

<p>The main complaint that the author has around <code>async</code>/<code>await</code> is that it requires your futures to be <code>Send</code> and <code>'static</code>. This property tends to spread throughout the program.</p>

<div><pre><code>async fn foo(&amp;BIG_GLOBAL_STATIC_REF_OR_SIMILAR_HORROR, sendable_chungus.clone())
</code></pre></div>

<p>Except, this isn’t a problem with Rust’s <code>async</code>, it’s a problem with <a href="https://crates.io/crates/tokio"><code>tokio</code></a>. <a href="https://crates.io/crates/tokio"><code>tokio</code></a> uses a <code>'static</code>, threaded runtime that has its benefits but requires its futures to be <code>Send</code> and <code>'static</code>. In <a href="https://crates.io/crates/smol"><code>smol</code></a>, on the other hand, it’s perfectly possible to pass around things by reference.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>big</span> <span>=</span> <span>/* ... */</span><span>;</span>
<span>let</span> <span>chungus</span> <span>=</span> <span>/* ... */</span><span>;</span>

<span>// With smol, you can create an executor...</span>
<span>let</span> <span>ex</span> <span>=</span> <span>smol</span><span>::</span><span>Executor</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>();</span>

<span>// ...and, as long as its captured variables outlive it, you can pass things around from the stack!</span>
<span>ex</span><span>.spawn</span><span>(</span><span>async</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>async</span> <span>fn</span> <span>foo</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>big</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>chungus</span><span>)</span><span>.await</span>
<span>})</span><span>.detach</span><span>();</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Actually, the main draw here is that this particular executor isn’t multithreaded. But it’s very easy to make it multithreaded.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>// Create an executor.</span>
<span>let</span> <span>ex</span> <span>=</span> <span>smol</span><span>::</span><span>Executor</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>();</span>

<span>// Create a channel used to stop the threadpool.</span>
<span>let</span> <span>(</span><span>signal</span><span>,</span> <span>shutdown</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>smol</span><span>::</span><span>channel</span><span>::</span><span>bounded</span><span>::</span><span>&lt;</span><span>()</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>);</span>

<span>// Create a threadpool to run this executor on.</span>
<span>std</span><span>::</span><span>thread</span><span>::</span><span>scope</span><span>(|</span><span>s</span><span>|</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// Spawn 4 worker threads.</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>_</span> <span>in</span> <span>0</span><span>..</span><span>4</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>let</span> <span>shutdown</span> <span>=</span> <span>shutdown</span><span>.clone</span><span>();</span>
        <span>let</span> <span>ex</span> <span>=</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>ex</span><span>;</span>
        <span>s</span><span>.spawn</span><span>(</span><span>move</span> <span>||</span> <span>smol</span><span>::</span><span>block_on</span><span>(</span><span>ex</span><span>.run</span><span>(</span><span>shutdown</span><span>)));</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>// Run a future on this executor.</span>
    <span>smol</span><span>::</span><span>block_on</span><span>(</span><span>ex</span><span>.spawn</span><span>(</span><span>async</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>// Variables can be passed along just like before!</span>
        <span>async</span> <span>fn</span> <span>foo</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>big</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>chungus</span><span>)</span><span>.await</span>
    <span>}));</span>
<span>});</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Let’s say you don’t even want to use threads. You’re a fan of <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cell/struct.RefCell.html"><code>RefCell</code></a> and <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/rc/struct.Rc.html"><code>Rc</code></a> so thread-safety doesn’t really fit your use-case. That’s okay too! <a href="https://docs.rs/async-executor/latest/async_executor/struct.LocalExecutor.html"><code>smol::LocalExecutor</code></a> doesn’t require anything to be <code>Send</code> at all.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>my_thing</span> <span>=</span> <span>RefCell</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>4</span><span>);</span>
<span>let</span> <span>ex</span> <span>=</span> <span>smol</span><span>::</span><span>LocalExecutor</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>();</span>

<span>// Look, ma! A thread-unsafe task!</span>
<span>ex</span><span>.spawn</span><span>(</span><span>async</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>*</span><span>ex</span><span>.borrow_mut</span><span>()</span> <span>=</span> <span>5</span><span>;</span>
<span>})</span><span>.detach</span><span>();</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Really, <code>Send</code> and <code>'static</code> are not intrinsic properties of <code>async</code> Rust; it’s just what the biggest runtime decided on. If you’re not a fan of that, consider taking <a href="https://crates.io/crates/smol"><code>smol</code></a> for a spin!</p>

<h2 id="wrap-it-up">Wrap it up</h2>

<p>Really, I think that most Rustacean’s fears of <code>async</code> are unjustified. Yes, there are complicated semantics at play, but really no more complicated than, say, a borrow checker. In exchange, you gain access to much more powerful program semantics (that you’re probably trying to use anyways!)</p>

<p>So, consider using <code>async</code>/<code>await</code> today! Even if you’ve been turned of by it in the past, there may be parts of the ecosystem that fit your use cases better.</p>

If you value you my writing on Medium, j</em><a href="http://futureproofnews.substack.com/subscribe" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank"><em>oining them is a great way to support that</em></a><em>.</em></p><p id="8522"><span>L</span>ove it or hate it, we’re living in the subscription era.</p><p id="2350">I’m not just talking about streaming platforms, which have been biting the wallet for years, or newspapers and magazines, which have simply migrated their long-term models to a new digital era. No, I’m talking about <em>everything</em>. Beer, insurance, cinema: just three of the crazy subscriptions that I’ve currently taken out.</p><p id="8169">This move stems, obviously, from the <strong>collapse of digital advertising</strong> and the <strong>decline of the high-street</strong>. These are two related trends, which have had an enormous impact on the way that product purchasing works. Media enterprises — whether that’s Netflix or the New York Times — cannot rely on advertising revenue to underwrite their costs, and, similarly, the rise of online retail has made the expense of doing IRL business prohibitive. And so, rather than going to a local bottle shop for my craft beers, I have them sent to me once a month. And where <em>product</em> is not available on subscription, those businesses use subscriptions to incentivise loyalty: just look at ASOS Premier, which puts the <em>fast</em> in fast fashion.</p><p id="3beb"><strong>Anyway, we all already know this because we all experience human life in 2023</strong>. But the impact of the rise of the subscription model on the media has been staggering. It has changed the way that people do business — not just the businesses themselves, but the would-be employees and contractors. Just look at this quote from British journalist Emma Gannon, <a href="https://pressgazette.co.uk/newsletters/substack-six-figures-emma-gannon/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">given to Press Gazette</a>, who has 26,000 subscribers to her lucrative Substack: “One of my passions really is talking about writers being paid fairly — and not just that, but even thriving and making a really good living from writing and creativity — because I think in the past people have often viewed it as a hobby or just a nice to have”.</p><p id="9de3">She credits Substack with offering that — a nice idea, and one, perhaps, that’s easy to imagine at 26,000 subscribers. Certainly, Gannon is not alone in having this experience with Substack, and I imagine it feels liberating for journalists who have previously been constrained by things like “contracts” and “editors”. In its early days, Substack was aggressive in providing its top — partner — writers with economic security: anecdotally I heard that they were offering 1.5x the salary of the magazines/newspapers that they were poaching columnists from.</p><p id="02b5">The question is not “can you make money with Substack?” or “can you find an audience with Substack?” but what the averages are. Substack’s CEO, Hamish McKenzie, has been quoted as putting the number of Substack subscribers at “millions”, which is not hugely helpful. Globally, the figure was pitched at about 500,000 paying subscribers in 2021, according to Nieman Lab. According to Axios there are more than 17,0000 writers running paying Substacks (<a href="https://futureproofnews.substack.com/subscribe" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">including mine</a>) and the Top 10 publishers earned more than $25m last year.</p><p id="04da">Very good, I’m sure. Substack’s own figures also refer to $300m paid out to writers, though that doesn’t claim to be an “annual” figure (as the $25m is). But let’s assume it is, for simplicity’s sake. That leaves $275m to be disbursed between 16,975 writers, which, if shared equally, would be $16,200 a piece. A nice side hustle, if not a living.</p><p id="bd84">But if the Top 10 publishers are making roughly $2.5m a piece, let’s also assume that the rest of the Top 100 (the top 0.59% of Substack paid writers) are making $500,000 on average. Then we lose another $45m and $230m is left to be shared between 16,000 (suddenly the average earning, if distributed equitably, is down to $13,609). You can repeat this exercise as many times as it takes you to realise that the average writer of a paid Substack is earning next to nothing. And probably that means that they’re broadcasting to next to nobody.</p><p id="9c73">While these thoughts were floating around about Substack — which is currently running a fundraising round <a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/03/28/substack-community-fundraising-round" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">encouraging writers to invest in the platform</a> — OnlyFans, the UK based membership service for <em>*cough*</em> fans, released its 2022 financials. The headlines were a $5.6bn spend on-site last year, of which the site takes a 20% cut before distributing to creators. Which means roughly $4.5bn was disbursed by OnlyFans to its 3.2m creators (a figure that’s up a staggering 47% from 2021).</p><p id="8c40">Distributed equally across all creators, this would be a mere $1,406 per person. But, like Substack, OnlyFans is, of course, not divided equally. In fact, the inequalities are even more stark. Top earners on OnlyFans can make almost as much as the Top 10 earners on Substack <em>combined</em>. Blac Chyna, rumoured to be the top earner, was said to have made $20m, annually, from the platform. (Other publications claim she makes $20m <em>a month</em> which seems like crazy money, even for softcore pornography).</p><p id="31e8">Again, the point here is that the subscriber side of the creator economy can be hugely lucrative, but the average earnings are almost certainly prohibitively minute. And unlike Substack, unsuccessful creators on OnlyFans don’t just have an archive of inane ramblings to show as evidence of their failed project. Likely, they have, instead, an archive of material which may create personal or professional issues in the future. All for gas money.</p><p id="d66d">But let’s think about the other side of the equation. How do consumers feel about this increasing reliance on an atomised constellation of subscriptions?</p><p id="aaca">The New York Times costs $7 for a hard copy. In the New York metro area, a full 7-day a week home delivery subscription will set you back $845 per year. This is the sort of inflation to print costs that drove the dot.com bubble and the digital boom, and made readers believe that they were getting value on the, apparently free, web. After all, who can afford to spend basically a thousand bucks a year on newspapers?</p><p id="e33f">The problem is, that’s close to 100-pages a day of content from hundreds of writers and dozens of top columnists. The Times has something like 2,000 writers on staff so (you can see that I have my calculator out today) that’s about $0.40 a year, per writer, if you’re a Times subscriber.</p><p id="72e0">To take a random example, Matthew Yglesias, the Vox founder, has a Subsack called Slow Boring (make your own joke, I’m sure he’s heard them all). Subscriptions cost $8 a month or $80 a year. That’s the same price as ex-Times columnist Bari Weiss’s (ironically, in this sense, named) Free Press, which retails at $8 a month (up from the $5 a month subscription Weiss initially offered when she left the Times for Substack).</p><p id="9284">I’m not going to debate the merits of Yglesias and Weiss as writers and columnists but at $80 a year, you could have 10 subscriptions to a Substack like Slow Boring for the cost of having the Times delivered to your front door every morning. At a basic level the cost per journalist, cost per editor, cost per photographer, cost per columnist, commentator, critic, contrarian…etc is <strong>going up in journalism, not down</strong>. Just as OnlyFans is, in fact, an extremely expensive way of consuming pornography (I don’t want to give away the secrets of the internet, but you can, in fact, acquire pornography for free), so too is the current trend of Substackification an extremely expensive way of consuming journalism.</p><p id="2b73">The question is where the inflection point for our consumption of paid subscriptions lies. The OnlyFans data from 2022 (<em>I really do wish that Substack would provide this sort of detail</em>) suggests a 27% rise in total “fans” year-on-year. At a modest 25% year-on-year increase to total number of fans, it would take OnlyFans 6 years to reach 1.1bn fans and 13 years before there are more fans (8.4bn) than people on earth. Jokes aside, the growth is demonstrably unsustainable and the cooling will necessarily come.</p><p id="616f">I’ve got this far in the piece without even mentioning the cost-of-living crisis and the commensurate reduction in households’ discretionary spending. How much are you spending now on eating out, compared to pre-pandemic levels? How much are you spending on wine? How much are you spending on toilet roll? How much are you spending on perfume? How much are you spending on dog food? How much are you spending on newspapers? How much are you spending on porn? If the answers to any of those questions is anything other than “less”, well done you (and <a href="http://futureproofnews.substack.com/subscribe" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">please take out a paid subscription to my newsletter</a>).</p><p id="7a26">The pressure on households to trim budgets is huge (see, for example, the impact that this has had on streaming platforms, which are a full half-decade cycle ahead of the rest of the media in this regard) and yet the number of available products continues to increase. Stop, for a second, and mull over the fact that <strong>OnlyFans experienced a 47% increase in the number of creators using its platform between 2021 and 2022</strong>. That’s almost a doubling; the sort of thing that scary amoebas would do in high school biology class.</p><p id="ad23">And, in fact, these two trends are highly related. Go back to the part where I looked at the distribution of cash on Substack and OnlyFans. I mentioned that we were not really talking about salaries but about “<strong>side hustles</strong>”. Another string in the bow of the multi-hyphenate. Sure, there’s the ambitious lure of miraculous making Matt Taibbi or Blac Chyna money, but more pragmatically, there’s the possibility of being able to supplement your income with a few thousand bucks of beer money. In a cost-of-living crisis, that’s not to be sniffed at. And with the media a more depressing environment than ever for job seekers — whether they’re at entry level or experienced — the temptation to take control of your own destiny is strong. And in a depression era, the moonshot of celebrity is even more gravitational than before. Look at the 1930s, when the Western economic climate was miserable, but the screens were littered with stars. Clark Cable, Humphrey Bogart, Cary Grant, Bette Davis, Katherine Hepburn, Judy Garland. Economic instability does not engender realism — it adds value to dreams.</p><p id="71c2">It all reminds me of a few years ago in the cycle of the Great Podcast Boom, when the fact that a handful of people had become stars, and made profitable careers, from podcasting, made the viewing public believe that podcasting was an expeditious route to success. In fact, podcasting is, in media terms, a low-yield product. Advertising is cheaper on podcasting than almost all equivalent products, and audiences are, on average, very small. Movies, TV, theatre, books, music, comedy, journalism, radio: all are media forms in which you are more likely to get famous and/or rich than podcasting.</p><p id="6edc">What people were confusing was the ease of creation with the ease of success. It is, in essence, the two-sided nature of the term “distribution”. Podcasters for many years prided themselves on the stunning ease of distribution. You could record in your bedroom, with gear bought from RadioShack, and be listened to all around the world by the time that the sun set. That’s one meaning of the term “distribution”, which we’ll label “technical distribution”. But distribution also speaks to the way that we access markets and audiences, not to mention capital. We’ll call this “social distribution”. Podcasting was never able to solve that distributional question. And, in fact, the graph seems to suggest an inverse correlation: the easier it is to technically distribute the product, the harder it is to achieve social distribution.</p><figure></figure><p id="285f">For now, we’re in an upward trend. Creators want more autonomy and audiences want to achieve a tighter fit for their social/political persuasion. Creators want to decrease their losses to an (imagined, largely) middleman, while audiences want to avoid inadvertent exposure to products they wouldn’t intentionally pay for. It’s a fragile truce but there’s one certainty: in the end, money will talk.</p><p id="eabf">Which brings me back to what I quote Emma Gannon as saying, at the start of the piece. She gave that quote to Press Gazette after <a href="https://thehyphen.substack.com/p/why-im-investing-in-substack" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">announcing</a> that she would be investing in Substack’s fundraising round. “I’m putting thousands of my own money back into Substack, because I believe in it,” she told her subscribers. “I believe in writers being paid. I believe more people should be able to make a good and profitable career out of writing.”</p><p id="69a8">It is an idyllic, almost utopian, perspective. There is an imagined logic at play, entirely divorced from reality. In the world where Substack were an expeditious route to “more people” being able to “make a good and profitable career out of writing”, we would also live in a world where you bought your lamp chops from a butcher, your baguette from a bakery, your stilton from a cheesemonger and your wine from a vintner, rather than just everything from a supermarket. The fact that there was a period, in the 90s and 00s, when consumers seemed to repudiate newspapers — the supermarkets of journalism — did not mean that the idea was wrong, but that the sale mechanic was at fault. Just as supermarkets have iterated, in the same period, to introduce self-service and home delivery, so too should the more endangered business of journalism. To think that long term stability is in returning to individual shopkeepers, and raising prices for consumers, is regression masking as progress.</p><p id="154c">The inflection point is coming — sure as it has already with podcasts — for Substack, OnlyFans and any platform where creators are reliant on the largesse of their audiences. When creators realise the dream of financial success and celebrity is sputtering, so too will the impression that this is a radical new future for content creation fade.</p><p id="59f0">The question is how best to ready oneself for this inevitability. Personally, I favour a like-minded bundling, trying to create a product that has more voices, viewpoints and expertise, and thus feels more acceptable at the sort of price point individual Substacks or OnlyFans accounts are retailing for. But of course, I’ve just re-invented the “website” there. So I suspect that producers will bend over backwards to find a solution that feels more radical and more innovative, even if its ultimately just as backwards looking as the dream of the subscription economy in the first place.</p><p id="353d"><a href="http://twitter.com/nickfthilton" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Give me a follow on Twitter, if you fancy, and let me know your thoughts!</em></a></p></div></div>]]></description>

										<p>Way back in 2017, <a href="https://awealthofcommonsense.com/2017/08/the-canadian-housing-market-is-bananas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I wrote about how bananas Canadian housing prices were</a>.</p>
<p>This was the chart I used at the time:</p>

<p>Canada basically skipped the housing bust from the Great Financial Crisis.</p>
<p>Well, things got even more bananas in the ensuing years.</p>
<p>Here’s the updated version:</p>
<img decoding="async" src="https://awealthofcommonsense.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screenshot-2023-09-07-131527-2.png" alt="" width="896" height="652" srcset="https://awealthofcommonsense.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screenshot-2023-09-07-131527-2.png 1037w, https://awealthofcommonsense.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screenshot-2023-09-07-131527-2-300x218.png 300w, https://awealthofcommonsense.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screenshot-2023-09-07-131527-2-1024x746.png 1024w, https://awealthofcommonsense.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screenshot-2023-09-07-131527-2-768x559.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 896px) 100vw, 896px">
<p>Canadian housing prices can remain irrational longer than you can stay solvent or something like that. The crazy thing is Canadian housing prices would have to fall an additional 40%+ from those levels just to get back in line with growth in real U.S. housing prices since 1975.</p>
<p>Since the start of 2005, Canadian home prices are up a staggering 142% on a real basis (after inflation). And that includes a decrease of 19% in the final 9 months of 2022.<sup>1</sup> From 2005-2022, U.S. housing prices were up just shy of 26% on a real basis.</p>
<p>Housing price gains in Canada make the U.S. housing price gain look tiny by comparison.</p>
<img decoding="async" src="https://awealthofcommonsense.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screenshot-2023-09-08-110922.png" alt="" width="404" height="512" srcset="https://awealthofcommonsense.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screenshot-2023-09-08-110922.png 588w, https://awealthofcommonsense.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screenshot-2023-09-08-110922-237x300.png 237w" sizes="(max-width: 404px) 100vw, 404px">
<p>The year-by-year gains and losses stand out here as well:</p>
<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://awealthofcommonsense.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screenshot-2023-09-08-110224.png" alt="" width="1037" height="758" srcset="https://awealthofcommonsense.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screenshot-2023-09-08-110224.png 1037w, https://awealthofcommonsense.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screenshot-2023-09-08-110224-300x219.png 300w, https://awealthofcommonsense.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screenshot-2023-09-08-110224-1024x748.png 1024w, https://awealthofcommonsense.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screenshot-2023-09-08-110224-768x561.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1037px) 100vw, 1037px">
<p>Bigger gains and bigger losses in Canada. It’s like the S&amp;P 500 versus the Nasdaq 100.</p>
<p>The differences between the two markets look even more stark when you compare the real gains in housing prices to real gains in disposable income over time:</p>
<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://awealthofcommonsense.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screenshot-2023-09-08-115349.png" alt="" width="741" height="839" srcset="https://awealthofcommonsense.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screenshot-2023-09-08-115349.png 741w, https://awealthofcommonsense.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screenshot-2023-09-08-115349-265x300.png 265w" sizes="(max-width: 741px) 100vw, 741px">
<p>I used the same scale for both to highlight the differences here.</p>
<p>Yes, real housing prices are now growing faster than real disposable income in the United States but that relationship has been relatively stable for the past 50 years or so. Incomes have kept pace with housing prices after accounting for inflation.</p>
<p>But things in Canada have gone completely off the rails over the past 20 years or so. Our kind neighbors to the north are in a completely different stratosphere than we are.</p>
<p>I’m not saying this makes it any easier if you’re looking to buy in the U.S. right now.</p>
<p>Affordability here is still as bad as it’s ever been. We just hit another new all-time high in average monthly payment (via <a href="https://www.redfin.com/news/housing-market-update-home-prices-increase-miami/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Redfin</a>):</p>

<p>Just be thankful you’re not trying to buy a house in Canada…it’s even worse there.</p>
<p>Michael and I talked about the insanity of Canadian housing prices and much more on this week’s Animal Spirits video:</p>

		<p>Welcome to Learning Zig, an introduction to the Zig programming language. This guide aims to make you comfortable with Zig. It assumes prior programming experience, though not in any particular language.</p>

		<p>Zig is under heavy development and both the Zig language and its standard library are constantly evolving. This guide targets the latest development version of Zig. However, it's possible for some of the code to be out of sync. If you've downloaded the latest version of Zig and have problems running some code, please <a href="https://github.com/karlseguin/blog/issues">report the issue</a>.</p>

		<p>For my computer, I'll be downloading <i>zig-macos-aarch64-0.12.0-dev.161+6a5463951.tar.xz</i>. You might be on a different platform or a more recent release. After expanding the archive you should have a <code>zig</code> binary (in addition to other things) which you'll want to alias, or add to your path; whatever flow you're used to.</p>

		<p>You should now be able to run <code>zig zen</code> and <code>zig version</code> to test your setup.</p>

<pre>Summary of changes
- move back to regular, non-macro, get_bits API
- reduce the lookup to switch the coding method
- shorter reads wherever possible, in particular for the end of bitstream
  (16 bits instead of 32, as per the above)

There are cases that really need longer lengths (larger EG codes) of up
to 27 bits.

Win64: 6.10 -&gt; 4.87 (~20% speedup)

Reference for an hypothetical 32bits version of the cached reader:
Win32: 11.4 -&gt; 9.8  (14%, because iDCT is not SIMDed)

The app doesn’t work on any iOS device, I’ve tried all the way back to 15.7! So stop telling us to try other devices and fix the damn thing, it’s been 3 months! The fault is the squad responsible not testing on iOS devices with multiple iOS version’s installed. Stop shifting the blame from DJI.<p>

It’s your incompetency that we’re still waiting! Full your finger out and get your act into gear! <img src="https://forum44.djicdn.com/static/image/smiley/emoji/3_2x.gif" smilieid="141" alt=""></p></div>

Hello, SlavoSpace. I'm sorry about the inconvenience. The delay of the display is due to the compatibility problem of mobile devices. Our engineering team has already noticed this problem. But temporarily, we suggest you try to change other mobile devices for testing.</blockquote></div><br>
Everyone has noticed it over year ago now and you have not sorted it, don't play dumb, DJI is just lazy with software, DJI could be amazing but you seem to fail so hard at firmware and software, get your act together</div>

Considered?! Our concerns shouldn’t be considered, it should damn well be fixed. You released a faulty product! I’ve spent a total of AU$3,000.00 on the FPV and if I knew not long after buying it that DJI have pathetic customer service and take this long to pull their fingers out of their backsides to release a software update, the I would’ve spent my money on something else!</p></div>

Yeah, this really sux. <br>
There is an alternative though. It's not perfect, but it works: Use the DJI flight simulator FPV <strong>app</strong> a.k.a DJI Virtual Flight<br>
I assume you also use the DJI Fly app? If not, install that too, here's a step by step:<br>
1. What you need to do is power on all your devices: Drone, Goggles, Controller and have them connect to each other (like you're about to fly for real).<br>
2. Then connect the goggles to your phone. (I find that this connecting to my android doesn't work if I don't have the short female usb to charger cable connected to the goggles, instead of the other way around.)<br>
3. Start the DJI fly app if it doesn't already open automatically. <br>
4. Now you shut down DJI Fly(, but leave everything connected).<br>
5. Open the DJI Flight Sim. app.<br>
6. Press the "Ready to go" button or whatever it says on that yellow button.<br>
7. The app will tell you to turn off your drone, so turn it off and continue.<br>
8. App might freeze for a moment as it establishes its own connection to your controller and goggles.<br>
9. Everything should now be connected and you can practice using your phone.<p>

I know, DJI should just fix their s*** but we know that's not happening any time soon. What's somehow <strong>extra annoying</strong> is that for 2 glorious hours it worked on windows, but after that, never again. Software up to date, reinstalled, controller connects to the computer just fine, but still blinks green like it's looking for a connection, and the windows app even knows the controller IS connected, but doesn't respond to any inputs. But what can you do?</p><p>

This has worked reliably for me. My cellphone is old, but runs the app just fine and other than the 30fps it is responsive enough to at least practice.</p></div>

hmm, not sure. I know there are multiple modes to fly, and there are tons of settings, but i dont think there is a mode that perfectly matches the DJI normal/sport mode, as it is really an fpv simulator, not specifically DJI. There are many drones to choose from, also the DJI FPV. This drone is actually called "dgi" <img src="https://forum44.djicdn.com/static/image/smiley/default/smile.gif" smilieid="1" alt="">&nbsp;&nbsp;, i think because license stuff. ironically this dgi in velocidrone behaves much more realistic than the offical dji virtual flight app. <p>

I only use the manual mode in this sim, because i think the normal or sport mode isn't really something i need to practice in a sim.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure there is a lot to learn in these modes as well, but it's not nearly as risky to do in real life than the manual mode. I actually practiced in real life in sport/normal mode, and when i got home i practiced the manual mode in the sim. So a little bit of both worlds in that way.</p><p>

anyway, i'm glad i spent the 15 euro's for this simulator. I think i practiced for a week or 2 or so everyday, an hour or more before finally doing manual in real life, and i immediately felt comfortable (first few times i went to around 50m in the air in normal mode, before switching mode). And i still practice in the sim, because it's fun.</p></div>

hmm, not sure. I know there are multiple modes to fly, and there are tons of settings, but i dont think there is a mode that perfectly matches the DJI normal/sport mode, as it is really an fpv simulator, not specifically DJI. There are many drones to choose from, also the DJI FPV. This drone is actually called "dgi"&nbsp; &nbsp;, i think because license stuff. ironically this dgi in velocidrone behaves much more realistic than the offical dji virtual flight app. <p>

I&nbsp;only use the manual mode in this sim, because i think the normal or sport mode isn't really something i need to practice in a sim.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure there is a lot to learn in these modes as well, but it's not nearly as risky to do in real life than the manual mode. I actually practiced in real life in sport/normal mode, and when i got home i practiced the manual mode in the sim. So a little bit of both worlds in that way.</p></blockquote></div><br>
I was looking last night and couldn’t see a The DJI FPV,&nbsp;&nbsp;it did see the one you mentioned and thought it looked like the FPV. I’ll look into it. </div>

In Sep 01, 2021 Virtual Flight 1.2.0 was released.<br>
It broke in March 14, 2022 when iOS 15.4 was released.<p>

After two months of being broken, Virtual Flight 1.3.1 was released on May 05, 2022.<br>
It stopped working just a few days later, on May 16, 2023 when iOS 15.6 was released.</p><p>

Virtual flight 1.3.2 was released on Jun 30 2022, but it didn't resolve the issue.<br>
Virtual Flight 1.4.0 was released on Aug 25, 2022, but it didn't resolve the issue.<br>
Virtual Flight 1.4.1 was released on Aug 30, 2022, fixing the issue after 3.5 months.</p><p>

Then iOS 16 came out on Sep 22 2022 and Virtual flight broke again.<br>
Virtual Flight 1.4.2 was released a week later on Sep 28 2022 to fix this.</p><p>

On March 27 2023, iOS 16.4 was released and DJI Virtual flight broke again.<br>
Currently Virtual Flight has been broken for five months.</p><p>

Since I bought my FPV, the simulator has been broken for about 10 months.<br>
I don't know what to say, it's inexcusable.</p></div>

No, that's not the case. DJI can perfectly well use the beta versions of iOS and verify that the app is working before a new iOS version comes out. Since the release of the FPV and the Avata, DJI has shown that they don't do this.<p>

There's no excuses for not following best practices when developing software. Neither are there any excuses for not delivering timely patches when issues shows up.</p></div>

Exactly. All companies who create apps for release to the App Store have beta access to every iOS update.</p></div>

Hello, SlavoSpace. I'm sorry about the inconvenience. The delay of the display is due to the compatibility problem of mobile devices. Our engineering team has already noticed this problem. But temporarily, we suggest you try to change other mobile devices for testing.</blockquote></div><br>
since I bought DJI FPV I haven't been able to train for 210 days due to DJI incompetence<p>

i would like to ask DJI again:</p><p>

is it fair?</p></div>

AGAIN: You sell the FPV Series including the Sim! I get the Message in my googles i should first practice in the simulator. PAHAHAHA...NOT WORKING. Whats the fu***** Problem? Millions and Millions of Cash but you Dev Team for Ios is only one person? that's just crazy. Jesus fu***** Christ. I'll sell the garbage and have my peace back again.

That is up from 28 per cent in the first quarter of last year, and 22 per cent in the same period in 2020. The central bank defines an investor as a buyer who took out a mortgage to buy the property while maintaining a mortgage on another home.</p><p>Meanwhile, the percentage of first-time homebuyers shrunk to 43 per cent in the first quarter of this year from 48 per cent in the same three months in 2020. Similarly, repeat buyers fell to 27.5 per cent from 30 per cent over the same period.</p><p>The Bank of Canada’s data reveal the growing investor influence on the Canadian <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/topics/housing/" target="_blank">housing</a> market. The pandemic’s low interest rate environment and the proliferation of marketing promoting real estate investing have encouraged everyday Canadians and investors to buy multiple properties.</p><p>“The presence of investors in real estate markets can amplify house price cycles,” the Bank of Canada said in a note accompanying the data.</p><p>“During housing booms, greater demand from investors can add to bidding pressures and intensify price increases,” said the note. “Similarly, when prices are stable or declining, a lower influx of investors can add downward pressure on housing demand and prices.”</p><p>So far, the federal government has not addressed individual domestic real estate investors as it tries to come up with policies to deal with the lack of affordable housing. Instead, Ottawa has targeted foreign real estate buyers with a ban on purchases until the end of 2024.</p><p>The central bank’s data are designed to shed light on two vulnerabilities facing the Canadian economy: the elevated level of household indebtedness and high house prices. It reveals that some vulnerabilities are increasing, including tiny increases in delinquencies for car loans and instalment loans, which have set repayment schedules. Mortgage delinquencies, in which a borrower misses a payment by at least 90 days, stayed steady at 0.12 per cent.</p><p>There was a slight uptick in highly indebted borrowers, or those with a mortgage that is 4.5 times greater than their annual income. And the share of new mortgage borrowers who spent more than 25 per cent of their gross income on mortgage payments was 29 per cent in the second quarter. That level is similar to the previous few quarters, but higher than 2022′s second quarter at 19 per cent.</p><p>The central bank considers households that spend at least a quarter of their gross income on mortgage payments to be more vulnerable to rising interest rates or a loss of income.</p><p>At the same time, other vulnerabilities are easing. The share of homeowners who put down less than 20 per cent of a property’s purchase price has waned over the past few years. They were responsible for 12 per cent of the purchases in the second quarter of this year, compared with 18 per cent in the same period in 2020.</p><p>The data show home flipping, where buyers sell their properties within 12 months of their purchase, has been on the rise over the past two years. But over all, home flipping still accounted for less than 3 per cent of transactions in the first quarter.</p><p>The bank said it would update these indicators every quarter.</p></article></div>]]></description>

<p>Scientists have transformed cancer cells into healthy muscle tissue in the lab using <a href="https://www.livescience.com/58790-crispr-explained.html"><u>CRISPR</u></a> gene-editing technology — and they hope new cancer treatments can be built on the back of this experiment.</p><p>In a study published Aug. 28 in the journal <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2303859120" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2303859120"><u>PNAS</u></a>, researchers found that disabling a particular protein complex in cells of <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/types/soft-tissue-sarcoma/patient/rhabdomyosarcoma-treatment-pdq" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cancer.gov/types/soft-tissue-sarcoma/patient/rhabdomyosarcoma-treatment-pdq"><u>rhabdomyosarcoma</u></a> (RMS) — a rare cancer in skeletal muscle tissue that mainly affects <a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/rhabdomyosarcoma/about/key-statistics.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/rhabdomyosarcoma/about/key-statistics.html"><u>children under age 10</u></a> — in the laboratory causes the tumor cells to turn into healthy muscle cells.</p><p>Although the research is still in its early days, this process of "resetting" cancer cells into healthy cells, broadly known as differentiation therapy, has already been tested in other types of cancer, such as <a href="https://www.cshl.edu/stopping-a-rare-childhood-cancer-in-its-tracks/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cshl.edu/stopping-a-rare-childhood-cancer-in-its-tracks/"><u>bone</u></a> and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8643352/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8643352/"><u>blood</u></a> cancer. <a href="https://www.haematologica.org/article/view/haematol.2020.262121" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.haematologica.org/article/view/haematol.2020.262121"><u>Four drugs</u></a> have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat the latter disease and generally work by inhibiting a specific protein in the cancer cells.</p><p>The protein complex pinpointed in the new research could serve as a target for such a therapy, the study authors wrote, and with further development, it could be a promising new treatment option for patients with RMS, which is normally treated with surgery, radiation and <a href="https://www.livescience.com/chemotherapy.html"><u>chemotherapy</u></a>.</p><p>"This technology can allow you to take any cancer and go hunting for how to cause it to differentiate," or cause it to stop multiplying uncontrollably and turn into normal, noncancerous cells, <a href="https://www.cshl.edu/research/faculty-staff/chris-vakoc/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cshl.edu/research/faculty-staff/chris-vakoc/"><u>Christopher Vakoc</u></a>, lead author and professor at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, said in a <a href="https://www.cshl.edu/once-rhabdomyosarcoma-now-muscle/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cshl.edu/once-rhabdomyosarcoma-now-muscle/"><u>statement</u></a>.

In RMS, however, patients have genetic mutations that cause their cells to make a specific protein, called <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2575376/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2575376/"><u>PAX3-FOXO1</u></a>, which stops differentiation from happening in skeletal muscle cells. So instead of turning into muscle, the cells form a mass of cancerous tissue.</p><p>In the new study, the researchers used CRISPR to disable, or "knock out," different genes to see which ones make proteins that work together with PAX3-FOXO1 to stop RMS cells from differentiating. Their analysis revealed that, if RMS cells lose the ability to make <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3744014/#:~:text=Highly%20conserved%20between%20human%20and,cycle%20and%20various%20human%20diseases." target="_blank" data-url="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3744014/#:~:text=Highly%20conserved%20between%20human%20and,cycle%20and%20various%20human%20diseases."><u>nuclear factor Y</u></a> (NF-Y) — a protein that regulates gene expression — the cells instead differentiate into muscle cells. Knocking out PAX3-FOXO1 directly has the same effect.</p><p>"The tumor loses all cancer attributes," Vakoc said in the statement. "They're switching from a cell that just wants to make more of itself to cells devoted to contraction."</p><p>Although deactivating PAX3-FOXO1 and NF-Y has similar effects, the researchers discovered that the proteins don't physically interact with each other. Instead, in RMS cells, NF-Y switches on the genes needed to make PAX3-FOXO1 by binding to a specific sequence of DNA. So by blocking NF-Y, the researchers also blocked production of PAX3-FOXO1.</p><p>The findings are still a long way from being translated into a treatment for RMS. However, drugs that inhibit NF-Y are already being developed, including those that stop the protein complex from <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31539186/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31539186/">forming</a> or <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33138093/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33138093/">binding to DNA</a>.</p><p>One hurdle that will need to be overcome is that NF-Y also regulates important processes in healthy cells, such as <a href="https://www.livescience.com/metabolism">metabolism</a> and the <a href="https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Cell-Cycle" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Cell-Cycle">cell cycle</a>, the series of steps that cells go through as they grow and divide. However, Vakoc and team hypothesize that because RMS cells are "highly sensitive" to changes in PAX3-FOXO1 expression, there could be a "window of opportunity" in which a drug inhibits NF-Y long enough for RMS cells to differentiate but not so long that healthy tissues get damaged. More research will be needed to confirm that this is a viable treatment strategy, they wrote.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Even as global tech giants are carrying out mass layoffs, several top Silicon Valley companies are reportedly looking to hire lower-paid tech workers from foreign countries. Google, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, Zoom, Salesforce and Palantir have applied for thousands of H1B worker visas this year, according to a US Department of Labor data, reported independent investigative journalist Lee Fang.</p><p>

Ironically, thousands of workers on H1B visa, including Indians, have been affected by the layoffs in the United States, with many taking to social media to share the news and seek new opportunities.</p><p>

Just a month after Sundar Pichai announced Google’s plan to cut 12,000 jobs around the world in January, the company filed applications for H1B visas to hire software engineers, analytical consultants, user experience researchers and other roles from outside the United States, with several requests aimed for new Google employees to join in August, the report states. Google parent Alphabet owned Waymo too has reportedly filed similar H1B applications to hire engineers.</p><p>

Meta has laid off nearly 25 per cent of its estimated workforce in just a few months in what CEO Mark Zuckerberg has called the company's "year of efficiency" as the US tech sector continues to downsize.<br>
Amazon CEO Andy Jassy in March laid out a plan to cut 9,000 more jobs from the online retail giant's workforce, following the 18,000 that were axed in January.</p><p>

The layoffs account for a smaller percentage of Amazon's total workforce, which ran up to 1.5 million people in December 2022, than the cuts seen at some other tech giants.</p><p>

Jassy told workers that the extra layoffs were necessary as the company seeks to downsize after years of hiring, particularly during the coronavirus pandemic when people turned to the internet for shopping.</p><p>

In January, Microsoft said it would eliminate 10,000 jobs, almost 5 per cent of the global workforce, as it braces for a potential recession. In an email to employees, CEO Satya Nadella said, “While we are eliminating roles in some areas, we will continue to hire in key strategic areas.”</p></div></div>]]></description>

  <h2><strong>A Plethora of Plastics</strong></h2><p>Most people know that most LEGO bricks are made of ABS, but that’s not the only plastic that LEGO uses! Historically and currently, LEGO bricks are made with a variety of materials depending on the use case. This article will explore many of them, with a brief overview of their properties and when/how they have been used.</p><p>Disclaimer: I am only a LEGO enthusiast, not a plastics specialist by any means. If anything here seems wrong or misleading, please do let me know and I will gladly correct it! Also note that within each plastic category, there is the potential for additives and colorants that may further affect how the part performs. Most of the plastics below are really names for families of hundreds of subtly different plastics. LEGO’s exact plastic formulations are trade secrets, and for good reason.</p><p><em>Much of this article was informed by The LEGO Group’s own </em><a href="https://www.lego.com/en-gb/sustainability/product-safety/materials" target="_blank"><em>materials webpage</em></a><em> as well as hobbyist researchers such as Gary Istok, Bailey Fullarton, and others.

<p>CA is a moderately hard <em>thermoplastic</em> (a plastic that softens when heated and hardens when cooled). It can have very glossy, vibrant coloration, and good transparency, but it doesn’t hold its color over time as well as other plastics. The very first LEGO bricks in 1949 were made from CA, and this use continued through the Town Plan and Samsonite eras. However, over time CA has a tendency to warp, often severely. Many of these bricks are now incompatible with modern bricks due to this deformation. LEGO switched to ABS around 1963, and fully phased CA out by 1970.</p>

<p>Polystyrene is a very durable plastic, used for some early bricks (PRIMA, waffle plates) and modern baseplates. Despite its impact resistance, it can be brittle, and has a tendency to turn white along the edges as it wears (see the factory-cut edge of the baseplate pictured, and play-worn Minitalia bricks). Older polystyrene bricks have a very high-pitched, glassy sound when dropped. I believe LEGO now adds a rubber additive to HIPS to increase its strength and flexibility, as well as decrease the whitening effect.</p>

  <p>Bakelite is a trademarked name and the world’s first synthetic plastic. Unlike thermoplastics like CA and ABS, Bakelite is a thermoset, meaning that once the resin has hardened it cannot be remolded. It is heat-resistant and inflexible, as well as very shiny and slightly translucent. These bricks were produced for LEGO by the Swedish company Geas Konstharts from 1950–1953, before they rebranded as PRIMA and switched to a polystyrene, which was likely cheaper to produce and had more coloration potential.</p><p>*At least, this is the current AFOL historian consensus for these Geas bricks. From my limited readings, it seems they may more likely be <a href="https://plastiquarian.com/?page_id=14332" target="_blank">Catalin or Beetle</a>, given the consistent bright colors and slight translucency.</p>

<p>ABS is a strong, stable, scratch-resistant thermoplastic, and makes up the vast majority of LEGO pieces since 1963. It is a translucent-milky color when uncolored, so it cannot be used for transparent parts. LEGO used to receive their raw ABS granules from Bayer, which has a long history of testing 2x4 bricks for LEGO in unusual colors and molds. In 2004 Bayer’s ABS division became Lanxess, which now provides LEGO with ABS under the brand name Novodur (colored with Lanxess’s Macrolex dyes).</p>

<p>Polypropylene is a tough, flexible plastic, used for most Bionicle weapons and minifigure parts that might break easily if they were a more rigid plastic. The plastic’s flexibility allows for it to be used as a “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_hinge" target="_blank">living hinge</a>”, as in the book pictured here. Because it cannot be fully transparent, colors like 48 Transparent Green (pictured) look nearly opaque in PP, sometimes being mistaken for their solid counterpart color. PP often turns whitish along the edges as it wears. It is used for as varied applications as large buckets and pick-a-brick cups, and even the polybags that parts and small sets come in!</p>

<p>Polycarbonate is a strong material that can be very clear. I believe that PC replaced CA for transparent parts at the same time that ABS replaced CA for opaque parts in 1963. The vast majority of transparent parts in LEGO’s history are made of PC — but around 2019, LEGO switched to MABS, so PC is now only used for opaque parts like hinges and joints. Transparent PC tends to bond to itself when connected tightly, which is why it’s so difficult to remove a transparent cone from a 4L bar, and PC minifigures only exist as rare delicate prototypes. The PC LEGO uses is Lanxess’s Makrolon.</p>

<p>This thermoplastic offers high strength and impact resistance, though not quite as strong as standard ABS. But unlike ABS, MABS offers high transparency and can display very bright transparent colors and glitter effects. Since around 2018, LEGO has switched to using MABS for most transparent parts (possibly because PC uses BPA, which is increasingly regulated by the EU—read more about the transition in <a href="https://bricknerd.com/home/a-clear-path-forward-for-transparent-bricks-1-21-22" target="_blank">this BrickNerd article</a>). It tends to look slightly milkier than older transparent parts, but I believe this is improving as LEGO continues to refine the material.</p>

<p>Polyamide, or nylon, is a very strong plastic that holds up against high impact, lending itself to connectors and gears, even in non-LEGO machinery, where durability is more important than perfect coloration. LEGO used nylon as far back as the 1960s for flexible vehicle couplings (pictured right), although today most of these have hardened and are very brittle. Modern Technic bricks with pins, such as 42929, are dual-molded so the brick part is ABS and the pin is PA (this is why they show up in BrickSet as “multicombination”, even though it’s the same color throughout).</p>

<p>TP is a broad category of materials, including PET, that are strong and can be very transparent. In LEGO, it is both tougher than PC (so the thin fire doesn’t snap) and softer than ABS (so the brick separator is less likely to damage other bricks). Fun fact, older separators were made out of HV-PC instead, so you might have both varieties in your collection.</p>

<p>Polyethylene is a very common thermoplastic with low strength and rigidity, and a low melting point. Its relative flexibility makes it perfect for large thin parts like leaves and stems. On the left in the photo above are high-density polyethylene (HDPE), while the right two parts are low-density polyethylene (LDPE): the lower the density, the softer it is. PE is a very versatile plastic — the thin plastic in LEGO store shopping bags is LDPE, and some <a href="https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?G=case1" target="_blank">carry cases</a> that have a living hinge are HDPE. In 2018, LEGO started sourcing their PE from 98% sugarcane (the two small leaves pictured), as part of their long-term <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/aboutus/news/2019/october/lego-plants-made-from-plants" target="_blank">sustainability plan</a>. Although the source is different, the end product is, in theory, identical.</p>

<p>SEBS is a thermoplastic that behaves like rubber, without needing vulcanization. LEGO uses this for tires — and, famously, LEGO makes most of the tires in the world, by number if not by mass! I believe that LEGO used to make their tires out of styrene-butadiene-styrene (SBS), which is less stable and heat-resistant than SEBS.</p>

<p>No photo here, sorry. PET, a type of polyester, is a versatile plastic used for water bottles (among a myriad of other items including fabrics and electronics). LEGO currently uses PET for thermoformed clamshell packages such as Build-a-Minifig packages and comic con promos. LEGO has been prototyping <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/aboutus/news/2021/june/prototype-lego-brick-recycled-plastic/" target="_blank">actual bricks</a> in this plastic, due to its readily recyclable nature (when not thermoformed), but none have been released publicly just yet.</p>

<p>As any LEGO fan knows, not all parts are plastic. LEGO has used all sorts of metals, fabrics, foams, rubber bands, and even wood to complete their sets, giving play functionality, textures, and motion that plastic alone couldn’t.</p>

  <h2><strong>The Future of Plastics</strong></h2><p>That’s all the plastics LEGO has used that I’m aware of — far more than I thought when I started, and I’m certain I haven’t caught all of them! In 2015, LEGO <a href="https://consumerist.com/2015/06/24/lego-investing-150m-to-develop-sustainable-non-plastic-materials-for-brick-making/" target="_blank">announced</a> plans to invest 1 billion DKK (~$150m USD) in developing new sustainable materials for their products over the following 15 years, kicking off with the 2016 opening of their LEGO Sustainable Materials Centre in Billund. In 2018, the first plant-sourced polyethylene parts <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/lego-sustainable-bricks/" target="_blank">started appearing</a> in sets. By 2020, plastic shopping bags were <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/sustainability/environment/sustainable-packaging/" target="_blank">being phased out</a> in LEGO stores. And in late 2020, LEGO announced that they were massively <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/aboutus/news/2020/september/sustainability" target="_blank">reinforcing</a> their sustainability plan, investing $400m USD to replace all packaging with sustainable materials (as well as other “social responsibility initiatives”). Paper bags are already replacing plastic bags inside sets this year.</p><p>So what becomes of ABS, the plastic that accounts for around 80% of LEGO’s production? LEGO <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/aboutus/news/2021/june/prototype-lego-brick-recycled-plastic/" target="_blank">has tested</a> “over 250 variations of PET”, as well as hundreds of other plastics — a New Elementary article <a href="https://www.newelementary.com/2018/07/sustainable-lego-plants-made-from-sugarcane.html" target="_blank">mentions</a> test bricks made from corn, algae, and wheat! But as of now, no final replacement has been announced, and the vast majority of LEGO parts remain fossil-fuel-based. I look forward to seeing what LEGO comes up with by 2030, and given our present climate crisis, it can’t come soon enough.</p>

  <p>Just for fun, what are some materials that LEGO <em>hasn’t</em> used for building bricks?

I have a 2x4 brick made of corn-based PLA (I wish I knew who made it) — not only bio-sourced but biodegradable too!

	  <p>I've been running a Kubernetes cluster on a mix of virtual and bare metal machines with Hetzner for about a year now, and while the setup has served me well, being a very exploratory exercise at the time it wasn't very well documented.</p>

<h2 id="choosing-a-kubernetes-distribution"><a href="#choosing-a-kubernetes-distribution" aria-label="Anchor link for: choosing-a-kubernetes-distribution">Choosing a Kubernetes Distribution</a></h2>
<p>I've deployed Kubernetes clusters in a myriad ways over the years, with all sorts of combinations of k8s|k3s|k0s using kubeadm|<a href="https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way">the hard way</a>|managed(EKS &amp; Exoscale) packaged using both Docker and Hashicorp's Packer and deployed with Ansible or Terraform, or more recently <a href="https://syself.com/">syself</a>'s <a href="https://github.com/syself/cluster-api-provider-hetzner">Cluster API Provider for Hetzner</a>.</p>
<p>My conclusion at this point is that if you can afford it, both in terms of privacy/GDPR and dollarinos then <em>managed</em> is the way to go. If you can't, then you have a bit of investigative work ahead of you.</p>
<p>All of the different tools I've tried have seemed great on paper, but usually had some annoying trade-off or caveat.</p>
<p>For <a href="https://www.packer.io/">Packer</a> and <a href="https://www.terraform.io/">Terraform</a> it's state management. Building static virtual machine images for all your control plane and worker nodes sounds great in theory, but you have to put those images <em>somewhere</em>. Kubernetes clusters are also not pure idempotent structures, even if they largely aspire to be. Handling cluster bootstrapping, node joining, etc. in Terraform is borderline impossible, not because Terraform is a bad tool, but because it is so far outside the realm of what it's designed to do. Terraform is about desired state, but you can't "desire" your way into bootstrapping a distributed system unless someone has hidden all the nitty gritty details from you behind a managed service.</p>
<p>For Cluster API and its providers, the issue is more of a me-problem than a them-problem. It's a very flexible setup, which is what allows it to work across so many providers and scenarios, even ones that make no effort to provide any kind of official Kubernetes support like Hetzner, or your own desktop Raspberry Pi cluster. All aspects of the cluster itself are managed through Kubernetes and Custom Resource Definitions, which is cool in its own right, but if you dig into the sausage of the Hetzner provider, you'll realize it's a tower built on <em>bash</em>. None of this should by any means disqualify it from use, but my experience with it was one of confusion. It did everything it should, but it was at times really hard to follow <em>why</em> it was doing what it did, or how. Like I said, I'm really impressed with their work otherwise and Cluster API might be the future, so it's probably a me-problem.</p>
<p>For <a href="https://k3s.io/">k3s</a>, <a href="https://k0sproject.io/">k0s</a> and all the other minimal Kubernetes distributions the problem is <em>alignment</em>. They're able to achieve their streamlined deployment and setup stories by making a lot of difficult decisions for you, which is great as long as your values align with theirs, otherwise you have to compromise, hack or turn back.</p>
<p>Talos Linux of course suffers the same curse as k3s and k0s, taking the decision-making to the extreme and choosing even the kernel for you. Fortunately however, their choices align perfectly with my needs and values. I really like the philosophy of container-oriented distributions and have previously dabbled in <a href="https://www.flatcar.org/">Flatcar Container Linux</a>, but at least at the time I found it very difficult to get working on Hetzner's bare metal servers, although the exact reasons elude me at this time.</p>
<p>Having read through the documentation for Talos Linux, I really like their approach to node and cluster configuration. It's very similar to the way Cluster API approaches it, but by owning the underlynig Linux distribution and not relying on existing tools like kubeadm to interact with the cluster, they get to radically simplify the interface exposed to the administrator, which makes it at least <em>look</em> like a very pleasant experience.</p>
<p>Based on that very subjective feeling, my past experience, and of course a healthy dose of grass always being greener, Talos Linux is my choice for this cluster.</p>
<h2 id="installing-talos-on-a-dedicated-server"><a href="#installing-talos-on-a-dedicated-server" aria-label="Anchor link for: installing-talos-on-a-dedicated-server">Installing Talos on a Dedicated Server</a></h2>
<p>Their <a href="https://www.talos.dev/v1.4/introduction/quickstart/">Quickstart</a> and <a href="https://www.talos.dev/v1.4/introduction/getting-started/">Getting Started</a> guides can get you started with a local Docker-based cluster, or with installing it on one of the supported providers, but deploying it to a Hetzner dedicated server takes some extra steps.</p>
<p>We can't provide the dedicated server with a custom ISO to boot from, but we can boot into Hetzner's rescue system and write the Talos ISO directly to a hard drive which means that next time we reboot the server (providing no other disks have valid boot configurations and take precedence) our server will boot into an unconfigured Talos instance running in Maintenance mode. This was the script I used to install Talos v1.4.4 onto my dedicated server from the Linux rescue system:</p>
<pre data-lang="bash"><code data-lang="bash"><span># I'm intentionally picking a version that's behind by patch version so I 
</span><span># can try out the upgrade procedure once it's up and running.
</span><span>TALOS_VERSION</span><span>="</span><span>v1.4.4</span><span>"
</span><span># Keep in mind that device paths might change between reboots so either
</span><span># double-check the device path, or use one of the udev paths instead.
</span><span>TARGET_DISK</span><span>="</span><span>/dev/sda</span><span>"
</span><span>
</span><span># Download the release asset designed for (bare) metal deployments.
</span><span>wget -O</span><span> /tmp/talos.tar.gz https://github.com/siderolabs/talos/releases/download/$</span><span>TALOS_VERSION</span><span>/metal-amd64.tar.gz
</span><span># Unpack the archive 
</span><span>tar -xvf</span><span> /tmp/talos.tar.gz
</span><span># Write the raw disk image directly to the hard drive.
</span><span>dd</span><span> if=disk.raw of=$</span><span>TARGET_DISK </span><span>&amp;&amp; </span><span>sync
</span><span>shutdown -r</span><span> now
</span></code></pre>
<p>After a while the server should come back up, so let's see if it worked by using the <code>talosctl</code> command line utility to interact with the (hopefully up) talos API on the node:</p>
<pre data-lang="bash"><code data-lang="bash"><span>[mpd@ish]$</span><span> talosctl</span><span> -n</span><span> 159.69.60.182 disks</span><span> --insecure
</span><span>error</span><span> getting disks: rpc error: code = Unavailable desc = connection error: desc = "</span><span>transport: Error while dialing: dial tcp 159.69.60.182:50000: i/o timeout</span><span>"
</span></code></pre>
<p>Curious! The server doesn't respond on the Talos API endpoint, looks like something went wrong.</p>
<p>Activating the Hetzner vKVM rescue system and forcing a hardware reset boots the server, and I can see the Talos interface. It even responds to my requests now:</p>
<pre data-lang="bash"><code data-lang="bash"><span>[mpd@ish]$</span><span> talosctl</span><span> -n</span><span> 159.69.60.182 disks</span><span> --insecure
</span><span>DEV</span><span>        MODEL            TYPE    MODALIAS      SIZE     BUS_PATH       SYSTEM_DISK
</span><span>/dev/sda</span><span>   QEMU HARDDISK    HDD     scsi:t-0x00   2.0 TB   .../0:0:0:0/      
</span><span>/dev/sdb</span><span>   QEMU HARDDISK    HDD     scsi:t-0x00   2.0 TB   .../1:0:0:0/      
</span><span>/dev/sdc</span><span>   QEMU HARDDISK    HDD     scsi:t-0x00   256 GB   .../2:0:0:0/   *
</span></code></pre>
<p><small>output truncated to fit</small></p>
<p>I've run into problems magically being solved by Hetzner's <a href="https://docs.hetzner.com/robot/dedicated-server/virtualization/vkvm/">vKVM system</a> before, so I'm not convinced we're out of the woods yet. If we can boot the system without the vKVM system, I'll put it down to a random fluke and continue configuration.</p>
<p>After another hardware reset (without the rescue system) Talos is still responding to our requests. I'm still not sure of the cause, but let's get on with it<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<h2 id="configuring-talos"><a href="#configuring-talos" aria-label="Anchor link for: configuring-talos">Configuring Talos</a></h2>
<p>In order to build a Kubernetes cluster from Talos, you must first configure Talos. This is done in two steps, first by generating a <code>talosconfig</code> which similarly to <code>kubeconfig</code> contains the definition of a collection of Talos endpoints and credentials to access them with. With Kubernetes you generally configure the cluster first and then extract the kubeconfig, but with Talos, you instead generate the configuration first and then <em>imprint</em> it on the individual nodes.</p>
<p>Following along in the <a href="https://www.talos.dev/v1.4/introduction/getting-started/">Getting Started</a> guide we first have to decide on a cluster name and endpoint. My intention is to run this cluster purely on bare metal, so I don't want to put a load balancer in front of the cluster, although that particular configuration was worked well for me in the past. I want to get as close to a DIY setup as I can, so it can potentially be migrated or extended to on-premise at a later date. For the same reason, and because of the high cost associated with it, using vSwitch and floating IPs is off the table as well.</p>
<p>I've chosen to use DNS load balancing, since I don't expect a lot of churn in control plane/talos nodes, nor heavy load.</p>
<h2 id="cluster-name-and-endpoint"><a href="#cluster-name-and-endpoint" aria-label="Anchor link for: cluster-name-and-endpoint">Cluster Name and Endpoint</a></h2>
<p>Let's start by exporting our cluster name and endpoint for future reference. I've picked the clustername "kronform" semi-arbitrarily, and will be using it as a subdomain of one of my existing domains to access it.</p>
<pre data-lang="bash"><code data-lang="bash"><span>[mpd@ish]$</span><span> export CLUSTER_NAME="</span><span>kronform</span><span>"
</span><span>[mpd@ish]$</span><span> export API_ENDPOINT="</span><span>https://api.kronform.pius.dev:6443</span><span>"
</span></code></pre>
<h2 id="dns"><a href="#dns" aria-label="Anchor link for: dns">DNS</a></h2>
<p>Create the DNS record pointing to our one node, so it has a chance to propagate by the time we'll need it.</p>
<p><img src="https://datavirke.dk/posts/bare-metal-kubernetes-part-1-talos-on-hetzner/dns-configuration.png" alt="DNS Configuration"></p>
<p>I've configured both IPv4 and IPv6 and set a low time-to-live, so if a node dies and has to be removed from the cluster in the future, its address should get cleared out of most DNS caches relatively quickly.</p>
<h2 id="secrets"><a href="#secrets" aria-label="Anchor link for: secrets">Secrets</a></h2>
<p>First we need to generate a secrets bundle which contains all the sensitive keys used to define our cluster:</p>
<pre data-lang="bash"><code data-lang="bash"><span>[mpd@ish]$</span><span> talosctl gen secrets</span><span> --output-file</span><span> secrets.yaml
</span></code></pre>
<p>We'll need to keep this file safe, but won't be able commit it to git until we have a method of encrypting it.</p>
<h2 id="talosconfig"><a href="#talosconfig" aria-label="Anchor link for: talosconfig">talosconfig</a></h2>
<p>Generate the <code>talosconfig</code> based on the cluster name and endpoint specified earlier.</p>
<pre data-lang="bash"><code data-lang="bash"><span>[mpd@ish]$</span><span> talosctl gen config  \
</span><span>    --with-secrets</span><span> secrets.yaml \
</span><span>    --output-types</span><span> talosconfig  \
</span><span>    --output</span><span> talosconfig        \
</span><span>    $</span><span>CLUSTER_NAME               </span><span>\
</span><span>    $</span><span>API_ENDPOINT
</span></code></pre>
<p>I'm not entirely sure why the API endpoint is required at this stage since it doesn't seem to figure in the generated <code>talosconfig</code> and the endpoint specified is just <code>127.0.0.1</code>. Meanwhile the provided <code>$CLUSTER_NAME</code> is used to name the context, so that at least makes sense:</p>
<pre data-lang="yaml"><code data-lang="yaml"><span>context</span><span>: </span><span>kronform
</span><span>contexts</span><span>:
</span><span>  </span><span>kronform</span><span>:
</span><span>    </span><span>endpoints</span><span>:
</span><span>    - </span><span>127.0.0.1
</span><span>    </span><span>ca</span><span>: </span><span>LS0t...
</span><span>    </span><span>crt</span><span>: </span><span>LS0t...
</span><span>    </span><span>key</span><span>: </span><span>LS0t...
</span></code></pre>
<p>Neither the <code>crt</code> or <code>ca</code> field certificate contain references to this endpoint either, and I suppose they wouldn't since it's for Kubernetes, and this relates to the Talos API.</p>
<p>Like the <code>secrets.yaml</code> file, this client configuration is also sensitive.</p>
<p>You can either copy this config file to <code>~/.talos/config</code> or use the <code>talosctl</code> merge command, which doesn't destroy any existing configurations you might have:</p>
<pre data-lang="bash"><code data-lang="bash"><span>[mpd@ish]$</span><span> talosctl config merge ./talosconfig
</span></code></pre>
<h2 id="generate-our-first-machineconfig"><a href="#generate-our-first-machineconfig" aria-label="Anchor link for: generate-our-first-machineconfig">Generate our first MachineConfig</a></h2>
<p>Now it's finally time to generate a talos machine configuration for our very first node!</p>
<p>... But not so fast! We'll need to customize it a bit. Now we could use <code>talosctl</code> to generate a <code>controlplane.yaml</code> generic machine configuration and then modify it to fit our needs, or we could use the patch system as intended instead to generate the finished config directly.</p>
<p>I've created a couple of directories to keep track of all this:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>patches/</code> where I'll put cluster-wide patches,</li>
<li><code>nodes/</code> which will contain the per-node patch files, and finally</li>
<li><code>rendered/</code> where I'll output the finished machine configurations.</li>
</ol>
<p>First of all we'll want to enable workloads on our control plane machines. Our servers are quite beefy and since we're going to run only bare metal, we'll need <em>somewhere</em> to run the workloads.</p>
<pre data-lang="yaml"><code data-lang="yaml"><span># patches/allow-controlplane-workloads.yaml
</span><span>cluster</span><span>:
</span><span>  </span><span>allowSchedulingOnControlPlanes</span><span>: </span><span>true
</span></code></pre>
<p>Secondly since we'll want to use <a href="https://cilium.io/">Cilium</a> as our CNI, so we need to disable the default CNI and disable <code>kube-proxy</code>, since Cilium comes with its own replacement as per the Talos <a href="https://www.talos.dev/v1.4/kubernetes-guides/network/deploying-cilium/#machine-config-preparation">documentation</a>:</p>
<pre data-lang="yaml"><code data-lang="yaml"><span># patches/disable-kube-proxy-and-cni.yaml
</span><span>cluster</span><span>:
</span><span>  </span><span>network</span><span>:
</span><span>    </span><span>cni</span><span>:
</span><span>      </span><span>name</span><span>: </span><span>none
</span><span>  </span><span>proxy</span><span>:
</span><span>    </span><span>disabled</span><span>: </span><span>true
</span></code></pre>
<p>We also want to override the cluster name and DNS domain. This is completely optional, but it's nice to have:</p>
<pre data-lang="yaml"><code data-lang="yaml"><span># patches/cluster-name.yaml
</span><span>cluster</span><span>:
</span><span>  </span><span>clusterName</span><span>: </span><span>kronform.pius.dev
</span><span>  </span><span>network</span><span>:
</span><span>    </span><span>dnsDomain</span><span>: </span><span>local.kronform.pius.dev
</span></code></pre>
<p>Finally, we need to add some customizations for our one node (named n1 here):</p>
<pre data-lang="yaml"><code data-lang="yaml"><span># nodes/n1.yaml
</span><span>machine</span><span>:
</span><span>  </span><span>install</span><span>:
</span><span>    </span><span>disk</span><span>: </span><span>none
</span><span>    </span><span>diskSelector</span><span>:
</span><span>      </span><span>size</span><span>: '</span><span>&lt; 1TB</span><span>'
</span><span>    </span><span>image</span><span>: </span><span>ghcr.io/siderolabs/installer:v1.4.4
</span><span>  </span><span>network</span><span>:
</span><span>    </span><span>hostname</span><span>: </span><span>n1
</span><span>    </span><span>interfaces</span><span>:
</span><span>    - </span><span>interface</span><span>: </span><span>eth0
</span><span>      </span><span>dhcp</span><span>: </span><span>true
</span></code></pre>
<p>I'm using the size-based disk selector since both the basic device path <code>/dev/sda</code> and the device bus path are subject to change between reboots, which is not ideal since our node is designed to attempt to converge on our desired state, which in some circumstances could cause Talos to reinstall itself multiple times on multiple devices.</p>
<p>I'm also (temporarily) hard-coding the image to use Talos v1.4.4 so we can try out the upgrade procedure once it's up and running. You should omit this line (<code>image: ghcr...</code>) from your configuration, if you don't care about that.</p>
<p>With all that done, it's time to generate the actual machine config for our node<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup>:</p>
<pre data-lang="bash"><code data-lang="bash"><span>[mpd@ish]$</span><span> talosctl gen config \
</span><span>        --output</span><span> rendered/n1.yaml                                 \
</span><span>        --output-types</span><span> controlplane                               \
</span><span>        --dns-domain</span><span> local.$</span><span>CLUSTER_NAME                          </span><span>\
</span><span>        --with-cluster-discovery</span><span>=false                            \
</span><span>        --with-secrets</span><span> secrets.yaml                               \
</span><span>        --config-patch</span><span> @patches/cluster-name.yaml                 \
</span><span>        --config-patch</span><span> @patches/disable-kube-proxy-and-cni.yaml   \
</span><span>        --config-patch</span><span> @patches/allow-controlplane-workloads.yaml \
</span><span>        --config-patch</span><span> @nodes/n1.yaml                             \
</span><span>        $</span><span>CLUSTER_NAME                                             </span><span>\
</span><span>        $</span><span>API_ENDPOINT
</span></code></pre>
<p>Configuration can now be found in <code>nodes/n1.yaml</code></p>
<h2 id="bootstrap-the-cluster"><a href="#bootstrap-the-cluster" aria-label="Anchor link for: bootstrap-the-cluster">Bootstrap the Cluster</a></h2>
<p>Review the rendered configuration in <code>rendered/n1.yaml</code> and apply it!</p>
<pre data-lang="bash"><code data-lang="bash"><span>[mpd@ish]$</span><span> talosctl</span><span> --nodes</span><span> 159.69.60.182 apply-config</span><span> --file</span><span> rendered/n1.yaml</span><span> --insecure
</span></code></pre>
<p>Rather anticlimactically we get absolutely no response. Luckily, we can use Talos' dashboard functionality to see what's going on:</p>
<pre data-lang="bash"><code data-lang="bash"><span>[mpd@ish]$</span><span> talosctl</span><span> -n</span><span> 159.69.60.182 dashboard
</span><span>rpc</span><span> error: code = Unavailable desc = connection error: desc = "</span><span>transport: Error while dialing: dial tcp 127.0.0.1:50000: connect: connection refused</span><span>"
</span></code></pre>
<p>Right. Our <code>talosconfig</code> doesn't know about the endpoint, so it just put in 127.0.0.1, let's fix that.</p>
<p>In <code>~/.talos/config</code> find the <code>endpoints</code> array...</p>
<pre data-lang="yaml"><code data-lang="yaml"><span># ~/.talos/config (before)
</span><span>context</span><span>: </span><span>kronform
</span><span>contexts</span><span>:
</span><span>    </span><span>kronform</span><span>:
</span><span>        </span><span>endpoints</span><span>:
</span><span>            - </span><span>127.0.0.1
</span><span># (...)
</span></code></pre>
<p>... And replace <code>127.0.0.1</code> with our one and only node <code>159.69.60.182</code>:</p>
<pre data-lang="yaml"><code data-lang="yaml"><span># ~/.talos/config (after)
</span><span>context</span><span>: </span><span>kronform
</span><span>contexts</span><span>:
</span><span>    </span><span>kronform</span><span>:
</span><span>        </span><span>endpoints</span><span>:
</span><span>            - </span><span>159.69.60.182
</span><span># (...)
</span></code></pre>
<p>Let's try again!</p>
<p><img src="https://datavirke.dk/posts/bare-metal-kubernetes-part-1-talos-on-hetzner/talos-dashboard.png" alt="Talos Dashboard"></p>
<p>Sweet! Scrolling back up the logs a bit we can see that the configuration was applied, and the <code>STAGE</code> has changed to <code>Booting</code>, where it would previously have been <code>Maintenance</code>.</p>
<p>More recently in the logs we can see a warning indicating that <code>etcd</code> is waiting to join a cluster. This is our cue to initiate the cluster bootstrap, so let's go ahead:</p>
<pre data-lang="bash"><code data-lang="bash"><span>[mpd@ish]$</span><span> talosctl</span><span> --nodes</span><span> 159.69.60.182 bootstrap
</span></code></pre>
<p>Watching the dashboard logs scroll by, talos will start spewing out a ton of warnings as it starts to reconcile the desired state of the newly bootstrapped cluster, bringing up services.</p>
<p>Eventually it will settle down, and the <code>READY</code> state of the node will change to <code>True</code>, and all the Kubernetes service indicators will switch to <code>Healthy</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://datavirke.dk/posts/bare-metal-kubernetes-part-1-talos-on-hetzner/all-green.png" alt="All Green Dashboard"></p>
<p>Let's reboot the node and see if it the installation stuck, or if we've just been dilly-dallying around in memory.</p>
<p>Since we don't have SSH access to the server, we can either request a hardware reset from the Hetzner Robot interface, or we can just ask Talos to do it for us.</p>
<pre data-lang="bash"><code data-lang="bash"><span>[mpd@ish]$</span><span> talosctl</span><span> --nodes</span><span> 159.69.60.182 reboot
</span></code></pre>
<p>This will launch a nice dynamic display of the status of the reboot, which is probably useful if you're rebooting multiple nodes.</p>
<p>The node will show as green, go red as it becomes unavailable, switch to yellow as it boots and then finally... Oh.</p>
<p>It never transitions back to green. Interesting. Talos dashboard works, and all the Kubernetes services are up, so let's extract the kubeconfig and see for ourselves.</p>
<p>The following command will create a systems administrator kubeconfig for our new cluster, merge it with our current <code>~/.kube/config</code> if one exists, and automatically set our cluster as the currently selected context.</p>
<pre data-lang="bash"><code data-lang="bash"><span>[mpd@ish]$</span><span> talosctl</span><span> -n</span><span> 159.69.60.182 kubeconfig
</span></code></pre>
<pre data-lang="bash"><code data-lang="bash"><span>[mpd@ish]$</span><span> kubectl get nodes
</span><span>NAME</span><span>   STATUS     ROLES           AGE   VERSION
</span><span>n1</span><span>     NotReady   control-plane   14m   v1.27.2
</span></code></pre>
<p>Our node <em>exists</em> so that's good, but it's <code>NotReady</code>, why?</p>
<pre data-lang="bash"><code data-lang="bash"><span>[mpd@ish]$</span><span> kubectl describe node n1 | </span><span>grep</span><span> NotReady
</span><span>  </span><span>Ready</span><span>            False   Thu, 22 Jun 2023 17:36:18 +0200   Thu, 22 Jun 2023 17:21:32 +0200   KubeletNotReady              container runtime network not ready: NetworkReady=false reason:NetworkPluginNotReady message:Network plugin returns error: cni plugin not initialized
</span></code></pre>
<p>Duh. We haven't installed a CNI yet!</p>
<p>We'll consider the job done for now, and tackle CNI-installation in the next post: <strong><a href="https://datavirke.dk/posts/bare-metal-kubernetes-part-2-cilium-and-firewalls/">Part II: Cilium CNI &amp; Firewalls</a></strong></p>
<h2 id="epilogue"><a href="#epilogue" aria-label="Anchor link for: epilogue">Epilogue</a></h2>
<p>Here I've gathered some of my reflections and learnings from the process.</p>

<dl><dd><h4>ABSTRACT</h4>
The C programming language was devised in the early 1970s as a system
implementation language for the nascent Unix operating system.
Derived from the typeless language BCPL, it evolved
a type structure;
created on a tiny machine as a tool to improve
a meager programming environment, it has become
one of the dominant languages of today.
This paper studies its evolution.

This paper is about the development of the C programming language,
the influences on it,
and the conditions under which it was created.
For the sake of brevity, I omit full descriptions of C itself,
its parent B [Johnson 73] and its grandparent BCPL [Richards 79],
and instead concentrate on characteristic elements
of each language and how they evolved.
<p>
C came into being in the years 1969-1973,
in parallel with the early development
of the Unix operating system;
the most creative period occurred during 1972.
Another spate of changes peaked between 1977 and 1979,
when portability of the Unix system was being demonstrated.
In the middle of this second period, the first widely available description
of the language appeared:
<i>The C Programming Language,</i>
often called the `white book' or `K&amp;R' [Kernighan 78].
Finally, in the middle 1980s, the language was officially standardized
by the ANSI X3J11 committee, which made further changes.
Until the early 1980s, although compilers existed for a variety
of machine architectures and operating systems, the language was almost exclusively
associated with Unix;
more recently, its use has spread much more widely, and today it
is among the languages most commonly used throughout the computer industry.
</p>
<h4>History: the setting
</h4>
<p>
The late 1960s were a turbulent era
for computer systems research at Bell Telephone Laboratories
[Ritchie 78] [Ritchie 84].
The company was pulling
out of the Multics project [Organick 75], which had started as a joint venture
of MIT, General Electric, and Bell Labs; by 1969, Bell Labs management,
and even the researchers, came to believe
that the promises of Multics could be fulfilled
only too late and too expensively.  Even before the GE-645 Multics
machine was removed from the premises, an informal group, led
primarily by Ken Thompson, had begun investigating alternatives.
</p>

Thompson wanted to create a comfortable computing
environment constructed according to his own design, using whatever
means were available.  His plans, it is evident in retrospect,
incorporated many of the innovative aspects of Multics, including an
explicit notion of a process as a locus of control,
a tree-structured file system, a command interpreter
as user-level program, simple representation of text files, and generalized
access to devices.
They excluded others, such as unified access to
memory and to files.  At the start, moreover, he and the rest
of us deferred another pioneering (though not original)
element of Multics, namely writing almost exclusively in a
higher-level language.
PL/I, the implementation language of Multics, was not
much to our tastes, but we were also using other languages, including BCPL, and
we regretted losing the advantages of writing programs in a
language above the level of assembler, such as
ease of writing and clarity
of understanding.
At the time we did not put much weight
on portability; interest in this arose later.
</p>
<p>
Thompson was faced with
a hardware environment cramped and spartan even for the time:
the DEC PDP-7 on which he started in 1968 was a machine with 8K 18-bit words
of memory and no software useful to him.
While wanting to use a higher-level language,
he wrote the original Unix system in PDP-7 assembler.
At the start, he did not even program
on the PDP-7 itself, but instead used a set of macros
for the GEMAP assembler on a
GE-635 machine.
A postprocessor
generated a paper tape readable by the PDP-7.
</p>
<p>
These tapes were
carried from the GE machine to the PDP-7 for testing until a primitive Unix kernel,
an editor, an assembler, a simple shell (command interpreter), and a few utilities
(like
the Unix
<i>rm, cat, cp</i>
commands)
were completed.  After this point, the operating system was self-supporting:
programs could be written and tested without resort to paper tape,
and development continued on the PDP-7 itself.
</p>
<p>
Thompson's PDP-7 assembler outdid even DEC's in simplicity;
it evaluated expressions and emitted the corresponding bits.
There were no libraries,
no loader or link editor: the entire source of a program was presented to
the assembler, and the output file—with a fixed name—that emerged was directly
executable.
(This name,
<i>a.out</i>,
explains a bit of Unix etymology;
it is the output of the assembler.
Even after the system gained a linker
and a means of specifying another name explicitly,
it was retained as the default executable
result of a compilation.)
</p>
<p>
Not long after Unix first ran on the PDP-7, in 1969, Doug McIlroy created
the new system's first higher-level language: an implementation of
McClure's TMG [McClure 65].  TMG is a language for writing compilers
(more generally, TransMoGrifiers) in a top-down, recursive-descent
style that combines context-free syntax notation with
procedural elements.  McIlroy and Bob Morris had used TMG to write the early
PL/I compiler for Multics.
</p>
<p>
Challenged by McIlroy's feat in reproducing TMG,
Thompson decided that Unix—possibly it had not even been
named yet—needed a system programming language.
After a rapidly scuttled attempt at Fortran,
he created instead a language of his own,
which he called B.
B can be thought of
as C without types; more accurately, it is BCPL squeezed into 8K bytes of memory
and filtered through Thompson's brain.
Its name most probably represents
a contraction of BCPL, though
an alternate theory holds that
it derives from Bon [Thompson 69],
an unrelated language created by
Thompson during the Multics days.
Bon in turn was named either after his wife Bonnie,
or (according to an encyclopedia quotation in its manual),
after a religion whose rituals involve the murmuring of magic formulas.
</p>
<h4>Origins: the languages
</h4>
<p>
BCPL was
designed by Martin Richards in the mid-1960s while he was visiting MIT,
and was used during the early 1970s
for several interesting projects, among them the OS6 operating system
at Oxford [Stoy 72], and parts of the seminal Alto work at Xerox PARC [Thacker 79].
We became familiar with it
because the
MIT CTSS system [Corbato 62] on which Richards worked was used for Multics development.
The original BCPL compiler was transported both to Multics and to the GE-635
GECOS system
by Rudd Canaday
and others at Bell Labs [Canaday 69];
during the final throes of Multics's life at Bell Labs
and immediately after, it was the language of choice
among the group of people who would later become involved with Unix.
</p>
<p>
BCPL, B, and C all fit firmly in the traditional
procedural family typified by Fortran and Algol 60.
They are particularly oriented towards
system programming, are small and compactly described,
and are amenable to translation by simple compilers.  They are `close
to the machine' in that the abstractions they introduce are readily
grounded in the concrete data types and operations supplied by
conventional computers, and they rely on library routines
for input-output and other interactions with an operating system.
With less success, they also use library procedures to specify interesting
control constructs such as coroutines and procedure
closures.  At the same time, their abstractions lie at a sufficiently
high level that, with care, portability between machines can
be achieved.
</p>
<p>
BCPL, B and C differ syntactically in many details, but broadly
they are similar.
Programs consist of a sequence of
global declarations and function (procedure) declarations.
Procedures can be nested in BCPL, but may not refer to non-static
objects defined in containing procedures.
B and C avoid this restriction by imposing a more severe one:
no nested procedures at all.
Each of the languages (except for earliest versions of B)
recognizes
separate compilation, and provides a means for including
text from named files.
</p>
<p>
Several syntactic and lexical mechanisms of BCPL are
more elegant and regular than those of B and C.
For example, BCPL's procedure and data declarations
have a more uniform structure, and it supplies a more complete
set of looping constructs.
Although BCPL programs are notionally supplied from an undelimited
stream of characters, clever rules allow most semicolons to be elided
after statements that end on a line boundary.
B and C omit this convenience, and end
most statements with semicolons.
In spite of the differences, most of the statements and operators of BCPL map
directly into corresponding B and C.
</p>
<p>
Some of the structural differences between BCPL and B
stemmed from limitations on intermediate memory.
For example, BCPL declarations may take the form
</p><dl><dt></dt><dd><tt><pre>let P1 be <i>command</i>
and P2 be <i>command</i>
and P3 be <i>command</i>
 ...
</pre></tt></dd></dl>
where the program text represented by the commands
contains whole procedures.
The subdeclarations
connected by
<tt>and</tt>
occur simultaneously, so the name
<tt>P3</tt>
is known inside procedure
<tt>P1</tt>.
Similarly, BCPL can package a group of declarations and statements into
an expression that yields a value, for example
<dl><dt></dt><dd><tt><pre>E1 := valof <i>( </i><i>declarations</i><i> ; </i><i>commands</i><i> ; resultis E2 </i><i>) + 1
</i></pre></tt></dd></dl><i>
</i>The BCPL compiler readily handled such constructs
by storing and analyzing a parsed representation of the entire
program in memory before producing output.
Storage limitations on the B compiler demanded a one-pass technique in which
output was generated as soon as possible, and the syntactic
redesign that made this possible was carried forward into C.

<p>
Certain less pleasant aspects of BCPL owed to its own technological
problems and were consciously
avoided in the design of B.
For example, BCPL uses a `global vector' mechanism for communicating
between separately compiled programs.
In this scheme,
the programmer explicitly associates the name of each externally visible
procedure and data object with a numeric offset in the global
vector; the linkage is accomplished in the compiled code
by using these numeric offsets.
B evaded this inconvenience initially by insisting that the entire
program be presented all at once to the compiler.
Later implementations of B, and all those of C, use a conventional
linker to resolve external names occurring in files compiled separately,
instead of placing the burden of assigning offsets on the programmer.
</p>
<p>
Other fiddles in the transition from BCPL to B were introduced as
a matter of taste, and some remain controversial, for example the decision
to use the single character
<tt>=</tt>
for assignment instead of
<tt>:=</tt>.
Similarly, B uses
<tt>/**/</tt>
to enclose comments, where BCPL uses
<tt>//</tt>,
to ignore text up to the end of the line.
The legacy of PL/I is evident here.
(C++ has resurrected the BCPL comment convention.)
Fortran influenced the syntax
of declarations:
B declarations begin with a specifier
like
<tt>auto</tt>
or
<tt>static</tt>,
followed by a list of names, and C
not only followed this style but ornamented it by
placing its type keywords at the start of declarations.
</p>
<p>
Not every difference between the BCPL language documented in
Richards's book
[Richards 79]
and B was deliberate;
we started from an earlier version of BCPL [Richards 67].
For example, the
<tt>endcase</tt>
that escapes from a BCPL
<tt>switchon</tt>
statement was not present in the language when we learned it
in the 1960s,
and so the overloading of the
<tt>break</tt>
keyword
to escape from the B and C
<tt>switch</tt>
statement
owes to divergent
evolution rather than conscious change.
</p>
<p>
In contrast to the pervasive syntax variation that occurred
during the creation of B, the core semantic content of BCPL—its
type structure and expression evaluation rules—remained intact.
Both languages are typeless, or rather have a single data type,
the `word,' or `cell,' a fixed-length bit pattern.  Memory in these languages
consists of a linear array of such cells, and the meaning of
the contents of a cell depends on the operation applied.
The
<tt>+</tt>
operator, for example, simply adds its operands using the machine's
integer add instruction, and the other arithmetic
operations are equally unconscious of the actual meaning
of their operands.  Because memory is a linear array, it is possible
to interpret the value in a cell as an index in this array,
and BCPL supplies an operator for this purpose.  In the
original language it was spelled
<tt>rv</tt>,
and later
<tt>!</tt>,
while B uses the unary
<tt>*</tt>.
Thus, if
<tt>p</tt>
is a cell containing
the index of (or address of, or pointer to) another cell,
<tt>*p</tt>
refers to the contents of the pointed-to cell, either
as a value in an expression or as the target of
an assignment.
</p>
<p>
Because pointers in BCPL and B are merely integer indices
in the memory array, arithmetic on them is meaningful:
if
<tt>p</tt>
is the address of a cell, then
<tt>p+1</tt>
is the address of
the next cell.
This convention is the basis for the semantics
of arrays in both languages.  When in BCPL one writes
</p><dl><dt></dt><dd><tt><pre>let V = vec 10
</pre></tt></dd></dl>
or in B,
<dl><dt></dt><dd><tt><pre>auto V[10];
</pre></tt></dd></dl>
the effect is the same: a cell named
<tt>V</tt>
is allocated, then
another group of 10 contiguous cells is set aside, and the memory index
of the first of these is placed into
<tt>V</tt>.
By a general rule, in B the expression
<dl><dt></dt><dd><tt><pre>*(V+i)
</pre></tt></dd></dl>
adds
<tt>V</tt>
and
<tt>i</tt>,
and refers to the
<tt>i</tt>-th
location after
<tt>V</tt>.
Both
BCPL and B each add special notation to sweeten such array accesses;
in B an equivalent expression is
<dl><dt></dt><dd><tt><pre>V[i]
</pre></tt></dd></dl>
and in BCPL
<dl><dt></dt><dd><tt><pre>V!i
</pre></tt></dd></dl>
This approach to arrays was unusual even at the time;
C would later assimilate it in an
even less conventional way.

<p>
None of BCPL, B, or C supports character data strongly
in the language; each treats strings
much like vectors of integers and supplements general rules by
a few conventions.
In both BCPL and B a string literal denotes the address of a
static area initialized with the characters of the string,
packed into cells.
In BCPL, the first packed byte contains the number of characters
in the string;
in B, there is no count and strings are terminated by
a special character, which B spelled
`<tt>*e</tt>'.
This change was made partially to avoid the limitation
on the length of a string caused by holding the count
in an 8- or 9-bit slot, and partly because maintaining
the count seemed, in our experience, less convenient than using a
terminator.
</p>
<p>
Individual characters in a BCPL string were usually manipulated
by spreading the string out into another array, one character per cell,
and then repacking it later;
B provided corresponding routines, but people more often used
other library functions that accessed or replaced individual
characters in a string.
</p>
<h4>More History
</h4>
<p>
After the TMG version of B was working, Thompson rewrote B in itself
(a bootstrapping step).
During development, he continually struggled against memory limitations:
each language addition
inflated the compiler so it could barely fit, but each
rewrite taking advantage of the feature reduced its size.
For example, B introduced generalized assignment operators, using
<tt>x=+y</tt>
to add
<tt>y</tt>
to
<tt>x</tt>.
The notation came from
Algol 68 [Wijngaarden 75] via McIlroy, who had incorporated
it into his version of TMG.
(In B and early C, the operator was spelled
<tt>=+</tt>
instead of
<tt>+=</tt>
; this mistake, repaired in 1976, was induced by a seductively easy
way of handling the first form in B's lexical analyzer.)
</p>
<p>
Thompson went a step further by inventing the
<tt>++</tt>
and
<tt>--</tt>
operators, which increment or decrement;
their prefix
or postfix position determines whether the alteration
occurs before or after noting the value of the operand.
They were not in the earliest versions of B, but appeared
along the way.
People often guess that
they were created to use the auto-increment and
auto-decrement address modes provided by the DEC PDP-11 on which C and Unix
first became popular.
This is historically impossible, since there was no PDP-11
when B was developed.
The PDP-7, however,
did have a few `auto-increment' memory cells, with the property
that an indirect memory reference through them incremented the cell.
This feature probably suggested such operators to Thompson;
the generalization to make them both prefix and postfix
was his own.
Indeed, the auto-increment cells were not used directly in implementation of the
operators, and a stronger motivation for the innovation was probably
his observation that
the translation of
<tt>++x</tt>
was smaller than that of
<tt>x=x+1</tt>.
</p>
<p>
The B compiler on the PDP-7 did not generate machine instructions,
but instead `threaded code' [Bell 72], an interpretive scheme in which
the compiler's output consists
of a sequence of addresses of code fragments that perform the
elementary operations.
The operations typically—in particular for B—act on a simple stack machine.
</p>
<p>
On the PDP-7 Unix system, only a few things were written in B except B itself,
because the machine was too small and too slow to do more than
experiment; rewriting the operating system and the utilities
wholly into B was too expensive a step to
seem feasible.
At some point Thompson relieved the address-space crunch by offering a
`virtual B' compiler that allowed the interpreted program to occupy more than 8K bytes
by paging the code and data within the interpreter,
but it was too slow to be practical for the common utilities.
Still, some utilities written in B appeared, including an early version of
the variable-precision calculator
<i>dc</i>
familiar to Unix users [McIlroy 79].
The most ambitious enterprise I undertook was a genuine
cross-compiler that translated B to GE-635 machine instructions, not threaded code.
It was a small
<i>tour de force</i>:
a full B compiler, written in its
own language and generating code for a 36-bit mainframe,
that ran on an 18-bit machine with 4K words of user address space.
This project was possible only because of the simplicity
of the B language and its run-time system.
</p>
<p>
Although we entertained occasional thoughts
about implementing one of the major languages of the time like Fortran,
PL/I, or Algol 68, such a project seemed hopelessly large for our resources:
much simpler and smaller tools were called for.
All these languages influenced our work,
but it was more fun to do things on our own.
</p>
<p>
By 1970, the Unix project had shown enough promise that we were
able to acquire the new DEC PDP-11.
The processor was among the first of its line delivered by DEC, and three months
passed before its disk arrived.
Making B programs
run on it using the threaded technique
required only writing the code fragments for the operators,
and a simple assembler which I coded in B;
soon,
<i>dc</i>
became the first
interesting program to be tested, before any operating system, on our PDP-11.
Almost as rapidly, still waiting for the disk, Thompson recoded
the Unix kernel and some basic commands in PDP-11 assembly language.
Of the 24K bytes of memory on the machine, the earliest PDP-11 Unix system
used 12K bytes for the operating system,
a tiny space for user programs, and the remainder as a RAM disk.
This version was only for testing, not for real work;
the machine marked time by enumerating closed knight's
tours on chess boards of various sizes.
Once its disk appeared, we quickly migrated to it after
transliterating assembly-language commands to the PDP-11 dialect, and
porting those already in B.
</p>
<p>
By 1971, our miniature computer center was beginning to have users.
We all wanted to create interesting software more easily.
Using assembler was dreary enough that B, despite its performance
problems, had been supplemented by a small library of useful service routines
and was being used for more and more new programs.
Among the more notable results of this period was Steve Johnson's
first version of the
<i>yacc</i>
parser-generator [Johnson 79a].
</p>
<h4>The Problems of B
</h4>
<p>
The machines on which we first used BCPL and then B were word-addressed,
and these languages' single data type, the `cell,' comfortably
equated with the hardware machine word.
The advent of the PDP-11 exposed several inadequacies of B's semantic model.
First, its character-handling mechanisms, inherited with few changes from BCPL,
were clumsy:
using library procedures to spread packed strings into individual
cells and then repack, or to access and replace
individual characters,
began to feel awkward, even silly, on a byte-oriented machine.
</p>
<p>
Second, although the original PDP-11 did not provide for floating-point
arithmetic,
the manufacturer promised that it would soon be available.
Floating-point operations had been added to BCPL
in our Multics and GCOS compilers by defining
special operators, but the mechanism was possible
only because on the relevant machines, a single word
was large enough to contain a floating-point number;
this was not true on the 16-bit PDP-11.
</p>
<p>
Finally, the B and BCPL model implied overhead in dealing
with pointers: the language rules, by defining a pointer
as an index in an array of words, forced pointers to be represented
as word indices.
Each pointer reference
generated a run-time scale conversion from the pointer to the
byte address expected by the hardware.
</p>
<p>
For all these reasons, it seemed that a typing scheme
was necessary to cope
with characters and byte addressing, and to prepare for the
coming floating-point hardware.
Other issues, particularly type safety and interface checking, did not
seem as important then as they became later.
</p>
<p>
Aside from the problems with the language itself, the B compiler's
threaded-code technique yielded programs
so much slower than their assembly-language counterparts
that we discounted the possibility of recoding the
operating system or its central utilities in B.
</p>
<p>
In 1971 I began to extend the B language by adding a character type
and also rewrote its compiler to generate PDP-11 machine instructions
instead of threaded code.
Thus the transition from B to C
was contemporaneous with the creation of a compiler
capable of producing programs fast and small enough
to compete with assembly language.
I called the slightly-extended language NB, for `new B.'
</p>
<h4>Embryonic C
</h4>
<p>
NB existed so briefly that no full description of
it was written.
It supplied the types
<tt>int</tt>
and
<tt>char</tt>,
arrays of them, and pointers to them, declared in a style typified by
</p><dl><dt></dt><dd><tt><pre>int i, j;
char c, d;
int iarray[10];
int ipointer[];
char carray[10];
char cpointer[];
</pre></tt></dd></dl>
The semantics of arrays remained exactly as in B and BCPL:
the declarations of
<tt>iarray</tt>
and
<tt>carray</tt>
create cells dynamically initialized with a value pointing to the
first of a sequence of 10 integers and characters respectively.
The declarations for
<tt>ipointer</tt>
and
<tt>cpointer</tt>
omit the size, to assert that no storage should be allocated automatically.
Within procedures, the language's interpretation of
the pointers was identical to that of the array variables:
a pointer declaration created a cell differing from
an array declaration only in that the programmer was expected to assign
a referent, instead of letting the compiler allocate the space
and initialize the cell.

<p>
Values stored in the cells bound to
array and pointer names
were the machine addresses,
measured in bytes, of the corresponding storage area.
Therefore, indirection through a pointer implied no
run-time overhead to scale the pointer from word to byte offset.
On the other hand, the machine code for array subscripting and pointer arithmetic
now depended on the type of the array or the pointer:
to compute
<tt>iarray[i]</tt>
or
<tt>ipointer+i</tt>
implied scaling the addend
<tt>i</tt>
by the size of the object referred to.
</p>
<p>
These semantics represented an easy transition from B,
and I experimented with them for some months.
Problems became evident when I tried to extend the type notation, especially
to add structured (record) types.
Structures, it seemed, should map in an intuitive way
onto memory in the machine,
but in a
structure containing an array, there was no good place to stash the
pointer containing the base of the array, nor any
convenient way to arrange that it be initialized.
For example, the directory entries of early Unix systems
might be described in C as
</p><dl><dt></dt><dd><tt><pre>struct {
	int	inumber;
	char	name[14];
};
</pre></tt></dd></dl>
I wanted the structure not merely to characterize an abstract object
but also to describe a collection of bits that might be read from
a directory.
Where could the compiler hide the pointer to
<tt>name</tt>
that the semantics demanded?
Even if structures were thought of more abstractly,
and the space for pointers could be hidden somehow,
how could I handle the technical problem of properly initializing
these pointers when allocating a complicated object, perhaps one that specified
structures containing arrays containing structures to arbitrary depth?

<p>
The solution constituted the crucial jump
in the evolutionary chain between typeless BCPL and typed C.
It eliminated the
materialization of the pointer in storage, and instead caused the
creation of the pointer when the array name is mentioned in an expression.
The rule, which survives in today's C, is that values of array
type are converted, when they appear in expressions, into
pointers to the first of the objects making up the array.
</p>
<p>
This invention enabled most existing B code to continue
to work, despite the underlying shift in the language's semantics.
The few programs that assigned new values to
an array name to adjust its origin—possible in B and BCPL,
meaningless in C—were easily repaired.
More important, the new language retained a coherent and workable (if unusual)
explanation of the semantics of arrays, while opening the way to a
more comprehensive type structure.
</p>
<p>
The second innovation that most clearly
distinguishes C from its predecessors is
this fuller type structure and especially its expression in the syntax of declarations.
NB offered the basic types
<tt>int</tt>
and
<tt>char</tt>,
together with arrays of them, and pointers to them,
but no further ways of composition.
Generalization was required:
given an object of any type, it should
be possible to describe a new object that gathers several into an array,
yields it from a function, or is a pointer to it.
</p>
<p>
For each object of such a composed type, there
was already a way to mention the underlying object:
index the array,
call the function, use the indirection operator on the pointer.
Analogical reasoning led to a declaration syntax for names
mirroring that of the expression syntax in which the names typically appear.
Thus,
</p><dl><dt></dt><dd><tt><pre>int i, *pi, **ppi;
</pre></tt></dd></dl>
declare an integer, a pointer to an integer, a pointer to
a pointer to an integer.
The syntax of these declarations reflects the
observation that
<tt>i</tt>,
<tt>*pi</tt>,
and
<tt>**ppi</tt>
all yield an
<tt>int</tt>
type when used in an expression.  Similarly,
<dl><dt></dt><dd><tt><pre>int f(), *f(), (*f)();
</pre></tt></dd></dl>
declare a function returning an integer, a function returning
a pointer to an integer, a pointer to a function returning
an integer;
<dl><dt></dt><dd><tt><pre>int *api[10], (*pai)[10];
</pre></tt></dd></dl>
declare an array of pointers to integers, and a pointer to
an array of integers.
In all these cases the declaration of a variable resembles
its usage in an expression whose type is the one named at the head of
the declaration.

<p>
The scheme of type composition adopted by C owes considerable debt
to Algol 68, although it did not, perhaps, emerge in a form
that Algol's adherents would approve of.
The central notion I captured from Algol was a type structure
based on atomic
types (including structures), composed into arrays, pointers (references),
and functions (procedures).
Algol 68's concept of unions
and casts also had an influence that appeared later.
</p>
<p>
After creating the type system, the associated
syntax, and the compiler for the new language,
I felt that it deserved a new name;
NB seemed insufficiently distinctive.
I decided to follow the single-letter style and called it C,
leaving open the question whether the name represented
a progression through the alphabet or through the letters in BCPL.
</p>
<h4>Neonatal C
</h4>
<p>
Rapid changes continued after the language had been named,
for example
the introduction of the
<tt>&amp;&amp;</tt>
and
<tt>||</tt>
operators.
In BCPL and B, the evaluation of expressions depends
on context: within
<tt>if</tt>
and other conditional statements that compare
an expression's value with zero,
these languages place a special interpretation on the
<tt>and</tt>
(<tt>&amp;</tt>)
and
<tt>or</tt>
(<tt>|</tt>)
operators.
In ordinary contexts, they operate bitwise, but
in the B statement
</p><dl><dt></dt><dd><tt><pre>if (e1 &amp; e2) ...
</pre></tt></dd></dl>
the compiler must evaluate
<tt>e1</tt>
and if it is non-zero, evaluate
<tt>e2</tt>,
and if it too is non-zero, elaborate the statement dependent on
the
<tt>if</tt>.
The requirement descends recursively on
<tt>&amp;</tt>
and
<tt>|</tt>
operators within
<tt>e1</tt>
and
<tt>e2</tt>.
The short-circuit semantics of the Boolean operators in such
`truth-value' context seemed desirable,
but the overloading of the operators was difficult to explain and use.
At the suggestion of Alan Snyder,
I introduced the
<tt>&amp;&amp;</tt>
and
<tt>||</tt>
operators
to make the mechanism more explicit.

<p>
Their tardy introduction explains an
infelicity of C's precedence rules.  In B one writes
</p><dl><dt></dt><dd><tt><pre>if (a==b &amp; c) ...
</pre></tt></dd></dl>
to check whether
<tt>a</tt>
equals
<tt>b</tt>
and
<tt>c</tt>
is non-zero;
in such a conditional expression it is better that
<tt>&amp;</tt>
have lower precedence than
<tt>==</tt>.
In converting from B to C, one wants to replace
<tt>&amp;</tt>
by
<tt>&amp;&amp;</tt>
in such a statement;
to make the conversion less painful,
we decided to keep the precedence of the
<tt>&amp;</tt>
operator the same relative to
<tt>==</tt>,
and merely split the precedence of
<tt>&amp;&amp;</tt>
slightly from
<tt>&amp;</tt>.
Today, it seems that it would have been preferable to move
the relative precedences of
<tt>&amp;</tt>
and
<tt>==</tt>,
and thereby simplify a common C idiom:
to test a masked value
against another value, one must write
<dl><dt></dt><dd><tt><pre>if ((a&amp;mask) == b) ...
</pre></tt></dd></dl>
where the inner parentheses are required but easily forgotten.

<p>
Many other changes occurred around 1972-3, but the most important
was the introduction of the preprocessor,
partly at the urging of Alan Snyder [Snyder 74],
but also in recognition of the utility of the
the file-inclusion mechanisms available in BCPL and PL/I.
Its original version was exceedingly simple,
and provided only included files and
simple string replacements:
<tt>#include</tt>
and
<tt>#define</tt>
of parameterless macros.
Soon thereafter, it was extended, mostly by Mike Lesk
and then by John Reiser,
to incorporate macros with arguments and conditional
compilation.
The preprocessor was originally considered an optional adjunct
to the language itself.  Indeed, for some years,
it was not even invoked unless the source program contained
a special signal at its beginning.
This attitude persisted, and explains
both the incomplete integration of the syntax of the
preprocessor with the rest of the language
and the imprecision of its description in early reference
manuals.
</p>
<h4>Portability
</h4>
<p>
By early 1973, the essentials of
modern C were complete.
The language and compiler were strong enough to permit us to
rewrite the Unix kernel for the PDP-11 in C during the summer of that year.
(Thompson had made a brief attempt to produce a system coded in an early version of
C—before structures—in 1972, but gave up the effort.)
Also during this period, the compiler was retargeted to other nearby machines,
particularly the Honeywell 635 and IBM 360/370;
because the language could not live in isolation,
the prototypes for the modern libraries
were developed.
In particular, Lesk wrote a `portable I/O package' [Lesk 72]
that was later reworked to become the C `standard I/O' routines.
In 1978 Brian Kernighan and I published
<i>The C Programming Language</i>
[Kernighan 78].
Although it did not describe some additions
that soon became common, this book served as the language
reference until a formal standard was adopted more than
ten years later.
Although we worked closely together on this book, there was a clear division of labor:
Kernighan wrote almost all the expository material, while
I was responsible for the appendix containing the reference manual and
the chapter on interfacing with the Unix system.
</p>
<p>
During 1973-1980,
the language grew a bit:
the type structure gained unsigned, long, union, and enumeration types,
and structures became nearly first-class objects
(lacking only a notation for literals).
Equally important developments appeared in its environment and the accompanying
technology.
Writing the Unix kernel in C had given us enough confidence in the language's
usefulness and efficiency that we began to recode the
system's utilities and tools as well,
and then to move the most interesting among them to the other
platforms.
As described in [Johnson 78a], we discovered that the hardest problems
in propagating Unix tools lay not in the
interaction of the C language with new hardware,
but in adapting to the existing software of other
operating systems.
Thus Steve Johnson began to work on
<i>pcc</i>,
a C compiler intended to be easy to retarget to new machines [Johnson 78b],
while he, Thompson, and I began to move the Unix system itself to
the Interdata 8/32 computer.
</p>
<p>
The language changes during this period, especially around 1977,
were largely focused on considerations of portability and type safety,
in an effort to cope with the problems we foresaw and observed
in moving a considerable body of code to the new Interdata
platform.
C at that time still manifested strong signs of its typeless
origins.
Pointers, for example, were barely distinguished from
integral memory indices in early language manuals or extant code;
the similarity of the arithmetic properties of
character pointers and unsigned integers made it hard
to resist the temptation to identify them.
The
<tt>unsigned</tt>
types were added to make unsigned arithmetic available
without confusing it with pointer manipulation.
Similarly, the early language condoned assignments between
integers and pointers, but this practice began to be discouraged;
a notation for type conversions (called `casts' from the example of Algol 68)
was invented to specify type conversions more explicitly.
Beguiled by the example of PL/I, early C
did not tie structure pointers firmly to the structures
they pointed to, and permitted programmers to write
<tt>pointer-&gt;member</tt>
almost without regard to the type of
<tt>pointer</tt>;
such an expression was taken uncritically as a reference
to a region of memory designated by the pointer, while the member
name specified only an offset and a type.
</p>
<p>
Although the first edition of K&amp;R described most of the
rules that brought C's type structure to its present form,
many programs written in the older, more relaxed style
persisted, and so did compilers that tolerated it.
To encourage people to pay more attention to the
official language rules, to detect legal but suspicious constructions,
and to help find interface mismatches
undetectable with simple mechanisms for separate compilation,
Steve Johnson adapted his
<i>pcc</i>
compiler to produce
<i>lint</i>
[Johnson 79b],
which scanned a set of files and remarked on dubious constructions.
</p>
<h4>Growth in Usage
</h4>
<p>
The success of our portability experiment on the
Interdata 8/32 soon led to another by Tom London and John Reiser
on the DEC VAX 11/780.
This machine became much more popular than the Interdata, and
Unix and the C language began to spread rapidly, both within AT&amp;T and
outside.
Although by the middle 1970s
Unix was in use by
a variety of projects within the Bell System
as well as a small group of research-oriented
industrial, academic, and government organizations outside our company,
its real growth began only after portability had been achieved.
Of particular note were the System III and System V
versions of the system from the emerging Computer Systems division of AT&amp;T, based
on work by the company's development and research groups,
and the BSD series of releases by the University
of California at Berkeley that derived from research
organizations in Bell Laboratories.
</p>
<p>
During the 1980s the use of the C language spread widely,
and compilers became available on nearly every machine architecture
and operating system; in particular it became popular as a
programming tool for personal computers, both for manufacturers
of commercial software for these machines, and for end-users
interested in programming.
At the start of the decade, nearly every compiler was based on Johnson's
<i>pcc</i>;
by 1985 there were many independently-produced compiler products.
</p>
<h4>Standardization
</h4>
<p>
By 1982 it was clear that C needed formal standardization.
The best approximation to a standard,
the first edition of K&amp;R, no longer described the language in actual use;
in particular, it mentioned neither the
<tt>void</tt>
or
<tt>enum</tt>
types.
While it foreshadowed the newer approach to structures, only after
it was published did the language support assigning them, passing them
to and from functions, and associating the names of members firmly
with the structure or union containing them.
Although compilers distributed by AT&amp;T incorporated these changes,
and most of the purveyors of compilers not based on
<i>pcc</i>
quickly picked up them up, there remained no complete, authoritative
description of the language.
</p>
<p>
The first edition of K&amp;R was also insufficiently precise on many details
of the language, and it became increasingly impractical to regard
<i>pcc</i>
as a `reference compiler;'
it did not perfectly
embody even the language described by K&amp;R, let alone subsequent extensions.
Finally, the incipient use of C in projects subject to commercial
and government contract meant that the imprimatur of an official
standard was important.
Thus (at the urging of M. D. McIlroy), ANSI established the X3J11
committee under the direction of CBEMA
in the summer of 1983, with the goal of producing
a C standard.
X3J11 produced its report [ANSI 89] at the end of 1989,
and subsequently this standard was accepted by ISO as
ISO/IEC 9899-1990.
</p>
<p>
From the beginning, the X3J11 committee took a cautious,
conservative view of language extensions.
Much to my
satisfaction, they took seriously their goal:
`to develop a clear, consistent, and unambiguous Standard
for the C programming language which codifies the common,
existing definition of C and which promotes the portability
of user programs across C language environments.' [ANSI 89]
The committee realized that mere promulgation of a standard
does not make the world change.
</p>
<p>
X3J11 introduced only one genuinely important change to the language itself:
it incorporated the types of formal arguments in the type
signature of a function, using syntax borrowed from C++ [Stroustrup 86].
In the old style, external functions were declared like this:
</p><dl><dt></dt><dd><tt><pre>double sin();
</pre></tt></dd></dl>
which says only that
<tt>sin</tt>
is a function returning a
<tt>double</tt>
(that is, double-precision floating-point) value.
In the new style, this better rendered
<dl><dt></dt><dd><tt><pre>double sin(double);
</pre></tt></dd></dl>
to make the argument type explicit
and thus encourage better type checking and appropriate conversion.
Even this addition, though it produced a noticeably better language,
caused difficulties.
The committee justifiably felt that simply outlawing
`old-style' function definitions and declarations was not
feasible, yet also agreed that the new forms were better.
The inevitable compromise was as good as it
could have been, though the language definition is complicated by
permitting both forms, and writers of portable software must contend
with compilers not yet brought up to standard.

<p>
X3J11 also introduced
a host of smaller additions and adjustments, for example,
the type qualifiers
<tt>const</tt>
and
<tt>volatile</tt>,
and slightly different type promotion rules.
Nevertheless, the standardization process did not change the character
of the language.
In particular, the C standard did not attempt to specify formally
the language semantics, and so there can be dispute over fine points;
nevertheless, it successfully accounted for changes in
usage since the original description, and is sufficiently precise to
base implementations on it.
</p>
<p>
Thus the core C language escaped nearly unscathed from the
standardization process, and the Standard emerged more
as a better, careful codification than a new invention.
More important changes took place in the language's surroundings:
the preprocessor and the library.
The preprocessor performs macro substitution, using conventions
distinct from the rest of the language.
Its
interaction with the compiler had never
been well-described, and X3J11 attempted to remedy the
situation.
The result is noticeably better than the explanation in the first edition of K&amp;R;
besides being more comprehensive, it provides
operations, like token concatenation, previously available
only by accidents of implementation.
</p>
<p>
X3J11 correctly believed that a full and careful
description of a standard C library was as important as its
work on the language itself.
The C language itself does not provide for input-output
or any other interaction with the outside world, and thus
depends on a set of standard procedures.
At the time of publication of K&amp;R, C was thought of mainly
as the system programming language of Unix; although we
provided examples of library routines intended to be readily transportable
to other operating systems, underlying support from Unix was implicitly
understood.
Thus, the X3J11 committee spent much of its time designing
and documenting a set
of library routines required to be available in all
conforming implementations.
</p>
<p>
By the rules of the standards process, the current activity of the X3J11
committee is confined to issuing interpretations on the existing
standard.
However, an informal group originally convened by Rex Jaeschke
as NCEG (Numerical C Extensions Group) has been officially accepted
as subgroup X3J11.1,
and they continue to consider extensions to C.
As the name implies, many of these possible extensions are intended to make the language
more suitable for numerical use: for example, multi-dimensional arrays
whose bounds are dynamically determined, incorporation of facilities
for dealing with IEEE arithmetic, and making the language more effective on machines
with vector or other advanced architectural features.
Not all the possible extensions are specifically numerical; they
include a notation for structure literals.
</p>
<h4>Successors
</h4>
<p>
C and even B have several direct descendants, though they
do not rival Pascal in generating progeny.
One side branch developed early.
When Steve Johnson visited the University of Waterloo on sabbatical
in 1972,
he brought B with him.  It became popular
on the Honeywell machines there, and later spawned Eh and Zed
(the Canadian answers to `what follows B?').
When Johnson returned to Bell Labs in 1973, he was disconcerted to
find that the language whose seeds he brought to Canada
had evolved back home;
even his own
<i>yacc</i>
program had been rewritten in C, by Alan Snyder.
</p>
<p>
More recent descendants of C proper include Concurrent C [Gehani 89],
Objective C [Cox 86], C* [Thinking 90],
and especially C++ [Stroustrup 86].
The language is also widely used as an intermediate
representation (essentially, as a portable assembly language)
for a wide variety of compilers, both for direct descendents
like C++, and independent languages like
Modula 3 [Nelson 91] and
Eiffel
[Meyer 88].
</p>
<h4>Critique
</h4>
<p>
Two ideas are most characteristic of C among languages of its class:
the relationship between arrays and pointers,
and the way in which declaration syntax mimics expression syntax.
They are also among its most frequently criticized features,
and often serve as stumbling blocks to the beginner.
In both cases, historical accidents or mistakes have exacerbated
their difficulty.
The most important of these has been the tolerance of C compilers
to errors in type.
As should be clear from the history above, C evolved from typeless
languages.
It did not suddenly appear to its earliest
users and developers as an entirely new language with its own rules;
instead we continually had to adapt existing programs as the
language developed, and make allowance for an existing body
of code.  (Later, the ANSI X3J11 committee standardizing C would
face the same problem.)
</p>
<p>
Compilers in 1977, and even well after,
did not complain about usages such as assigning between integers
and pointers or using objects of the wrong type to refer
to structure members.
Although the language definition presented in the first edition of K&amp;R
was reasonably (though not completely) coherent in its treatment of type rules,
that book admitted that existing compilers didn't enforce them.
Moreover, some rules designed to ease early transitions
contributed to later confusion.
For example, the empty square brackets in the function declaration
</p><dl><dt></dt><dd><tt><pre>int f(a) int a[]; { ... }
</pre></tt></dd></dl>
are a living fossil, a remnant of NB's way of declaring a pointer;
<tt>a</tt>
is, in this special case only, interpreted in C as a pointer.
The notation survived in part for the sake of
compatibility, in part under the rationalization
that it would allow programmers
to communicate to their readers
an intent to pass
<tt>f</tt>
a pointer generated from an array, rather than a reference to a single
integer.
Unfortunately, it serves as much to confuse the learner
as to alert the reader.

<p>
In K&amp;R C, supplying arguments of the proper type to a function call
was the responsibility of the programmer, and the extant compilers
did not check for type agreement.
The failure of the original language to include argument types
in the type signature of a function
was a significant weakness,
indeed the one that required the X3J11 committee's boldest and most painful
innovation to repair.
The early design is explained (if not justified) by my avoidance of technological
problems, especially cross-checking between separately-compiled source files,
and my incomplete assimilation of the implications of moving between
an untyped to a typed language.
The
<i>lint</i>
program,
mentioned above,
tried to alleviate the problem:
among its other functions,
<i>lint</i>
checks the consistency and coherency of a whole program by scanning a set
of source files,
comparing the types of function arguments used in calls with those
in their definitions.
</p>
<p>
An accident of syntax contributed to the perceived complexity of the language.
The indirection operator, spelled
<tt>*</tt>
in C, is syntactically a unary prefix operator, just as in BCPL and B.
This works well in simple expressions, but in more complex cases,
parentheses are required to direct the parsing.
For example, to distinguish indirection through the value
returned by a function from calling a function designated by
a pointer, one writes
<tt>*fp()</tt>
and
<tt>(*pf)()</tt>
respectively.
The style used in expressions carries through to declarations, so the names might be
declared
</p><dl><dt></dt><dd><tt><pre>int *fp();
int (*pf)();
</pre></tt></dd></dl>
In more ornate but still realistic cases, things become worse:
<dl><dt></dt><dd><tt><pre>int *(*pfp)();
</pre></tt></dd></dl>
is a pointer to a function returning a pointer to an integer.
There are two effects occurring.
Most important, C has a relatively rich set of ways of
describing types (compared, say, with Pascal).
Declarations in languages
as expressive as C—Algol 68, for example—describe objects equally hard
to understand, simply because the objects themselves are complex.
A second effect owes to details of the syntax.
Declarations in C must be read
in an `inside-out' style that many find
difficult to grasp [Anderson 80].
Sethi [Sethi 81] observed that many of the nested declarations
and expressions would become simpler
if the indirection operator had been taken as a postfix operator
instead of prefix, but by then it was too late to change.

<p>
In spite of its difficulties,
I believe that the C's approach to declarations remains plausible,
and am comfortable with it; it is a useful unifying principle.
</p>
<p>
The other characteristic feature of C, its treatment of arrays,
is more suspect on practical grounds, though it also has
real virtues.
Although the relationship between pointers and arrays
is unusual, it can be learned.
Moreover, the language shows considerable power to describe important
concepts, for example, vectors whose length varies at run time,
with only a few basic rules and conventions.
In particular, character strings are handled by the same mechanisms
as any other array, plus the convention that a null character
terminates a string.
It is interesting to compare C's approach with that of two
nearly contemporaneous languages, Algol 68 and Pascal [Jensen 74].
Arrays in Algol 68 either have fixed bounds, or are `flexible:'
considerable mechanism is required both in the language
definition, and in compilers, to accommodate flexible arrays
(and not all compilers fully implement them.)
Original Pascal had only fixed-sized arrays and strings,
and this proved confining [Kernighan 81].
Later, this was partially fixed, though the resulting
language is not yet universally available.
</p>
<p>
C treats strings as arrays of characters
conventionally terminated by a marker.
Aside from one special rule about initialization by string literals,
the semantics of strings are fully subsumed by more general
rules governing all arrays, and
as a result the language is simpler to describe and
to translate than one incorporating the string as a unique
data type.
Some costs accrue from its approach:
certain string operations are more expensive than in other designs
because application code or
a library routine must occasionally search for the end of a string,
because few built-in operations are available, and because
the burden of storage management for strings falls more
heavily on the user.
Nevertheless, C's approach to strings works well.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, C's treatment of arrays in general (not just strings)
has unfortunate implications both for optimization
and for future extensions.
The prevalence of pointers in C programs, whether those declared
explicitly or arising from arrays, means that
optimizers must be cautious, and must use careful dataflow techniques
to achieve good results.
Sophisticated compilers can understand what most pointers
can possibly change, but some important usages remain difficult
to analyze.
For example, functions with pointer arguments derived from
arrays are hard to compile into efficient code on
vector machines, because it is seldom possible to determine
that one argument pointer does not overlap data also
referred to by another argument, or accessible externally.
More fundamentally, the definition of C so specifically describes
the semantics of arrays that
changes or extensions treating arrays as more
primitive objects, and permitting operations on them as wholes,
become hard to fit into the existing language.
Even extensions to permit the declaration and use of multidimensional arrays whose
size is determined dynamically are not entirely straightforward [MacDonald 89]
[Ritchie 90],
although they would make it much easier to write numerical
libraries in C.
Thus, C covers the most important uses of strings and arrays
arising in practice by a uniform and simple mechanism,
but leaves problems for highly efficient implementations and for extensions.
</p>
<p>
Many smaller infelicities exist in the language
and its description
besides those discussed above, of course.
There are also
general criticisms to be lodged that transcend detailed points.
Chief among these is that the language and its generally-expected
environment provide little help for writing very large systems.
The naming structure provides only two main levels,
`external' (visible everywhere) and `internal' (within
a single procedure).
An intermediate level
of visibility (within a single file of data and procedures)
is weakly tied to the language definition.
Thus, there is little direct support for modularization,
and project designers are forced to create their own conventions.
</p>
<p>
Similarly, C itself provides two durations of storage:
`automatic' objects that exist while control resides in or below
a procedure, and `static,' existing throughout execution of a program.
Off-stack, dynamically-allocated storage is provided only
by a library routine and
the burden of managing it is placed on
the programmer: C is hostile to automatic garbage collection.
</p>
<h4>Whence Success?
</h4>
<p>
C has become successful to an extent far surpassing any early
expectations.  What qualities contributed to its widespread use?
</p>
<p>
Doubtless the success of Unix itself was the most important factor;
it made the language available to hundreds of thousands of people.
Conversely, of course, Unix's use of C and its consequent
portability to a wide variety of machines
was important in the system's success.
But the language's invasion of other environments suggests more
fundamental merits.
</p>
<p>
Despite some aspects mysterious to the beginner and
occasionally even to the adept,
C remains a simple and small language, translatable with simple and small compilers.
Its types and operations are
well-grounded in those provided by
real machines, and for
people used to how computers work,
learning the idioms for generating time- and space-efficient programs
is not difficult.
At the same time the language is sufficiently abstracted from machine
details that program portability can be achieved.
</p>
<p>
Equally important, C and its central library support always
remained in touch with a real environment.
It was not designed in isolation to prove a point, or to serve
as an example, but as a tool to write programs that did
useful things; it was always meant to interact with a larger
operating system, and was regarded as a
tool to build larger tools.
A parsimonious, pragmatic approach influenced the things that went into C:
it covers
the essential needs of many programmers,
but does not try to supply too much.
</p>
<p>
Finally, despite the changes that it has undergone since its first
published description, which was admittedly informal
and incomplete, the actual C language as seen by millions of users
using many different compilers has remained remarkably stable
and unified compared to those of similarly widespread currency,
for example Pascal and Fortran.
There are differing dialects of C—most noticeably, those described by
the older K&amp;R and the newer Standard C—but on the whole, C has remained
freer of proprietary extensions than other languages.
Perhaps the most significant extensions are the `far' and `near'
pointer qualifications intended to deal with peculiarities
of some Intel processors.
Although C was not originally designed with portability
as a prime goal, it succeeded in expressing
programs, even including operating systems,
on machines ranging from the smallest personal
computers through the mightiest supercomputers.
</p>
<p>
C is quirky, flawed, and an enormous success.
While accidents of history surely helped,
it evidently satisfied a need for a system implementation language
efficient enough
to displace assembly language, yet sufficiently abstract and fluent to
describe algorithms and interactions in a wide variety of environments.
</p>
<h4>Acknowledgments
</h4>
<p>
It is worth summarizing compactly the roles of the direct contributors to today's
C language.
Ken Thompson created the B language in 1969-70; it was derived directly
from Martin Richards's BCPL.
Dennis Ritchie turned B into C during 1971-73, keeping most of B's syntax
while adding types and many other changes, and writing the
first compiler.
Ritchie, Alan Snyder, Steven C. Johnson, Michael Lesk, and Thompson contributed language
ideas during 1972-1977,
and Johnson's portable compiler remains widely used.
During this period, the collection of library routines grew
considerably, thanks to these people and many others at Bell Laboratories.
In 1978, Brian Kernighan and Ritchie wrote the book that
became the language definition for several years.
Beginning in 1983, the ANSI X3J11 committee standardized
the language.  Especially notable in keeping its
efforts on track were its officers
Jim Brodie, Tom Plum, and  P. J. Plauger, and the successive draft redactors,
Larry Rosler and Dave Prosser.

              <p>For those of you who aren’t aware, the Mojo SDK was recently released, so I thought I would take the opportunity to start benchmarking some Julia code against Mojo. As a first test, I am calculating the Mandelbrot set using the <a href="https://docs.modular.com/mojo/notebooks/Mandelbrot.html" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">code provided by Modular</a>.</p>
<p>This is my Julia implementation:</p>

    z = c
    for i = 1:MAX_ITERS
        z = z * z + c
        if abs2(z) &gt; 4
            return i
        end
    end
    return MAX_ITERS
end

    result = zeros(yn, xn)

    y_range = range(ymin, ymax, xn)

    Threads.@threads for j = 1:yn
        for i = 1:xn
            x = x_range[i]
            y = y_range[j]
            result[j, i] = mandelbrot_kernel(complex(x, y))

<p>On my machine, the Mojo code will run in <strong>2.14 ms</strong>. The Julia code takes <strong>7.45 ms</strong>. I’m using 32 threads for Julia, but I admit that I haven’t fine tuned that number. I was wondering if anyone would be willing to offer up ways to improve the Julia code further? I don’t really know what else I can do and I think this would be an excellent way to learn more about squeezing every last drop of performance out of Julia. If we could end up beating the Mojo code that’d be fantastic! Doubly so because of how much more elegant the Julia code is.</p>
<p>Thank you all for your time.</p>

<p>The Federal Trade Commission's chief administrative law judge ruled that Intuit violated US law with deceptive advertising and should be forced to stop promoting TurboTax as "free" unless all conditions imposed on the free offer are immediately and conspicuously displayed to consumers.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/intuit_initial_decision_public_redacted_1.pdf">initial decision</a> by Administrative Law Judge D. Michael Chappell was released today and is subject to an automatic review by the full commission. The FTC commissioners will likely rule against Intuit, which issued a statement indicating that it will take the matter to federal court. The order would be in effect for 20 years if it survives appeal.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.intuit.com/blog/news-social/intuit-responds-to-u-s-federal-trade-commissions-anticipated-decision-and-reaffirms-its-commitment-to-free-tax-preparation/">The response from Intuit</a> noted that the administrative law judge is "an employee of the FTC" and "ruled in favor of the FTC in the agency's own lawsuit." The FTC filed an <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2022/03/ftc-sues-intuit-its-deceptive-turbotax-free-filing-campaign">administrative complaint</a> against Intuit in March 2022.</p>
<p>"Intuit will appeal this groundless and seemingly predetermined decision by the FTC to rule in its own favor and is confident that when the matter ultimately returns to a neutral body Intuit will prevail, as it has previously in this matter," the company said.</p>
<p>Intuit also said it "already adheres to most of the advertising practices in the FTC's erroneous decision. There is no monetary penalty, and Intuit expects no significant impact to its business."</p>
<h2>Clearly and conspicuously</h2>
<p>According to Chappell's 242-page ruling, "the evidence proves that Intuit engaged in deceptive advertising in violation of Section 5 of the FTC Act." Intuit "advertised to consumers that they could file their taxes online for free using TurboTax, when in truth, for approximately two-thirds of taxpayers, the advertised claim was false," he wrote.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>The order said Intuit "must not represent that a good or service is 'Free'" unless it actually offers the good or service for free to all consumers, or "All the terms, conditions, and obligations upon which receipt and retention of the 'Free' good or service are contingent are set forth clearly and conspicuously at the outset of the offer so as to leave no reasonable probability that the terms of the offer might be misunderstood."</p>
<p>Moreover, if an Intuit good or service is not free for most US taxpayers, that fact must be "disclosed clearly and conspicuously at the outset of any disclosures required" by the order. The order defines "clearly and conspicuously" in some detail.</p>
<p>"In any communication that is solely visual or solely audible, the disclosure must be made through the same means through which the communication is presented," it says. "In any communication made through both visual and audible means, such as a television advertisement, the disclosure must be presented simultaneously in both the visual and audible portions of the communication even if the representation requiring the disclosure is made in only one means."</p>
<p>The order then provides more specifics on how disclosures must be conveyed in various formats. For example, visual disclosures "must stand out from any accompanying text or other visual elements so that it is easily noticed, read, and understood," and audible disclosures "must be delivered in a volume, speed, and cadence sufficient for ordinary consumers to easily hear and understand it."</p>
<p>Similarly strict requirements apply to online advertisements, product labels, and face-to-face communications. The disclosures also "must not be contradicted or mitigated by, or inconsistent with, anything else in the communication."</p>                                            
                                                        
<h2>Court denied FTC injunction request</h2>
<p>At the same time it filed the administrative complaint last year, the FTC also <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/03/turbotax-maker-sued-by-ftc-over-deceptive-ads-that-promise-free-tax-filing/">sued Intuit</a> in US District Court for the Northern District of California. In the federal court, a judge denied the FTC's motion for a preliminary injunction in an April 2022 <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.393685/gov.uscourts.cand.393685.66.0.pdf">order</a> that said the issue could remain on hold while the FTC's administrative process unfolds.</p>
<p>The ruling said that "Intuit had removed several of the most plausibly deceptive advertisements—that is, three videos that repeated the word 'free' a dozen or more times over 30 seconds before a very brief disclaimer."</p>
<p>"However, if Intuit resumes its full advertising campaign... or the facts on the ground change significantly, the FTC may return to this Court to request relief," US District Judge Charles Breyer wrote.</p>
<p>In a separate case involving all 50 US states and the District of Columbia, Intuit, in May 2022, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/05/turbotax-forced-to-stop-misleading-free-free-free-ads-and-pay-back-141m/">agreed</a> to pay $141 million in restitution to nearly 4.4 million consumers who "started using TurboTax's Free Edition for tax years 2016 through 2018 and were told that they had to pay to file even though they were eligible to file for free using the IRS Free File program offered through TurboTax," New York Attorney General Letitia James' office said at the time. Under that settlement, Intuit was required to stop its "free, free, free" ad campaign.</p>
<p>In its response to the administrative law judge's decision, Intuit said it expected the ruling because of the FTC's "flawed and highly questionable process, Chair Lina Khan's previous public and prejudicial statements against Intuit, and the fact that the FTC has ruled in its own favor in nearly every consumer protection case for the last two decades."</p>
<p>"We believe the FTC's decision is improper, wholly ignores the facts, and tramples on the foundations of an independent American judicial system with its serving as prosecutor, judge, and jury on its own matters," Intuit said.</p>
