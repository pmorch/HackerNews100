<p>I quit my job towards the end of last month.</p>



<p>When I started this blog, I told myself, “Don’t talk about work.” Since my employment is in the rear view mirror, I’m going to bend that rule for once. And most likely, only this one time.</p>



<p>Why? Since I wrote <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/06/08/furward-momentum-introduction/">a whole series about how to get into tech for as close to $0 as possible without prior experience</a>, I feel that omitting my feelings would be, on some level, dishonest.</p>



<h2 id="refusing">Refusing Forced Relocation</h2>



<p>I had been hired in 2019 for the cryptography team at a large tech company. I was hired as a 100% remote employee, with the understanding that I would work from my home in Florida.</p>



<p>Then a pandemic started to happen (which continues to be a <a href="https://time.com/6213103/us-government-long-covid-response/">mass-disabling event</a> despite what many politicians proclaim).</p>



<p>The COVID-19 pandemic forced a lot of people who preferred to work in an office setting to sink-or-swim in a remote work environment.</p>



<p>In early 2020, you could be forgiven for imagining that this new arrangement was a temporary safety measure that we would adopt for a time, and then one day return to normal. By mid 2022, only people that cannot let go of their habits and traditions continued to believe that we’d ever return to the “normal” they knew in 2019.</p>



<p>As someone who had been working remote since 2014, as soon as the shift happened, many of my peers reached out to me for advice on how to be productive at home. This was an uncomfortable experience for many of them, and as someone who was comfortable in a fully virtual environment, I was happy to help.</p>



<p>By early 2021, I was considered to not only be a top performer, but also a critical expert for the cryptography organization. My time ended up split across three different teams, and I was still knocking my projects out of the park. But more importantly, junior employees felt comfortable approaching me with questions and our most distinguished engineers sought my insight on security and cryptography topics. </p>



<p>It became an inside joke of the cryptography organization, not to let me ever look at someone else’s source code on a Friday, because I would inevitably find at least one security issue, which would inevitably ruin someone’s weekend. I suppose the reasoning was that, if the source code in question belonged to a foundational software package, it carried the risk of paging the entire company as we tried to figure out how to mitigate the issue and upstream the fix. </p>



<p>(I never once got earnestly reprimanded for finding security bugs, of course.)</p>



<p>I can’t really go into detail about the sort of work I did. I don’t really want to name names, either. But I will say that I woke up every day excited and motivated. The problems were interesting, the people were wonderful, and there was an atmosphere of respect and collaboration. </p>



<p>Despite the sudden change in working environment for most of the cryptography organization in response to COVID-19, we were doing great work and cultivating the same healthy and productive work environment that everyone fondly remembered pre-pandemic.</p>





<p>And then the company’s CEO decided to make an unceremonious, unilateral, top-down decision (based entirely on vibes from talking to other CEOs, rather than anything resembling facts, data, or logic):</p>



<p><strong>Everyone must return to the office, and virtual employees must relocate</strong>. Exceptions would be few, far between, and required a C-level to sign off on it. Good luck getting an exception before your relocation decision deadline.</p>



<p><em>Hey, tech workers, stop me if you’ve heard this one before.</em></p>



<p>To the credit of my former managers, they sprung this dilemma on me literally the day before I went to a hacker conference–a venue full of hiring managers and technical founders.</p>



<h2 id="ultimatums">On Ultimatums</h2>



<p>If I had to give only one bit of advice to anyone ever faced with an ultimatum from someone with power over them (be it an employer or abusive romantic partner), it would be:</p>



<p><strong>Ultimately, never choose the one giving you an ultimatum.</strong></p>





<p>If your employer tells you, “Move to an expensive city or resign,” your best move will be, in the end, to quit. Notice that I said, <em>in the end</em>.</p>



<p>It’s perfectly okay to pretend to comply to buy time while you line up a new gig somewhere else.</p>



<p>That’s what I did. Just don’t start selling your family home or looking at real estate listings, and <em>definitely</em> don’t accept any relocation assistance (since you’ll have to return it when you split).</p>



<p>Conversely, if you let these assholes exert their power over you, you dehumanize yourself in submission.</p>



<p>(Yes, you did just read those words on a blog written by a furry.)</p>



<p>If you take nothing else away from this post, always keep this in mind.</p>





<h2 id="idiocy">From Whence Was This Idiocy Inspired?</h2>



<p>Nothing happens in a vacuum.</p>



<p>When more tech workers opted to earn their tech company salaries while living in cheaper cost-of-living houses, less tech worker money circulated to big city businesses. </p>



<p>This outflow of money does hurt the local economies of said cities, including the ones that big tech companies are headquartered in. In some cases, this pain has jeopardized a lot of the tax incentives that said companies enjoy.</p>



<p>That’s why we keep hearing about <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/seattle-mayor-praises-amazons-back-to-office-policy-in-state-of-the-city-address/">politicians praising the draconian way that the return-to-office policies are being enforced</a>.</p>



<p>At the end of the day, incentives rule everything around us.</p>



<p>Companies have to kowtow to the government in order to reduce their tax bill (and continue pocketing record profits–which drive inflation–while their workers’ wages stagnate). </p>



<p>This outcome was incredibly obvious to everyone that was paying attention; it was just a matter of when, not if.</p>



<h3 id="signs">Signs of Things to Come</h3>



<p>Do you know who was <em>really</em> paying attention? The top talent at most tech companies.</p>



<p>After I turned in my resignation, I received a much larger outpour of support from other very senior tech workers than I ever imagined.</p>



<p>Many of them admitted that they were actively looking for new roles; some of them for the first time in over a decade. </p>



<p>Many of them already have new gigs lined up, and were preparing to resign too. Some of those already have.</p>



<p>Others are preparing to refuse to comply with either demand, countering the companies’ ultimatums with one of their own: <strong>Shut up or fire me.</strong></p>



<p>What I took from these messages is this: What tech companies are doing is complete bullshit, and everyone knows it, and nobody is happy about it.</p>



<p>With all this in mind, I’d like to issue a prediction for how this return-to-office with forced relocation will play out, should companies’ leaders double down on their draconian nature.</p>



<h3 id="prediction">My Prediction</h3>



<p>Every company that issued forced relocation ultimatums to their pre-pandemic remote workers will not only lose most (if not all) their top talent in the next year, but they will struggle to hire for at least the coming decade.</p>



<p>The bridge has been burnt, and the well has been poisoned.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Trust arrives on foot, but leaves on horseback.</p>
<cite>Dutch proverb</cite></blockquote>



<p>The companies that issued these ultimatums are not stupid. They had to know that some percentage of their core staff would leave over their forced relocation mandates. Many described it as a “soft layoff” tactic.</p>



<p>But I don’t think they appreciate the breadth or depth of the burn they’ve inflicted. Even if they can keep their ships from sinking, the wound will fester and their culture will not easily recover. This will lead to even more brain drain.</p>



<p><em>Who could blame anyone for leaving when that happens?</em></p>



<p>Unfortunately, there is a class of people that work in tech that will bear the brunt of the ensuing corporate abuse: <strong>H-1B visa employees</strong>, whose immigration status is predicated on their ongoing employment. Their ability to hop from abusive companies onto lifeboats is, on the best of days, limited.</p>



<p>And <em>that</em>? Well, that’s going to get ugly.</p>



<p>There’s still time for these companies to slam the brakes on their unmitigated disaster of failed leadership before it collapses the whole enterprise. </p>



<p>If I were a betting <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/08/10/all-about-dholes-and-dhole-fursonas/">dhole</a>, I wouldn’t bet money on most of them doing that. </p>



<p>Their incentives aren’t aligned that way yet, and when they finally are, it will be far too late.</p>



<h2 id="new-opportunities">Toward New Opportunities</h2>



<p>As for me, I’m enjoying some well-earned downtime before I start my new remote job.</p>



<p>I wasn’t foolish enough to uproot my life and everyone I love at some distant corporate asshole’s whims, but I also wasn’t impulsive enough to jump ship without a plan.</p>



<p>That’s as much as I feel comfortable saying about myself on here.</p>



<p>If you’re facing a similar dilemma, just know that you’re not alone. Savvy companies will be taking advantage of your current employer’s weakness to <em>pan for gold</em>, so to speak.</p>



<p>You are not trapped. Your life is your own to live. Choose wisely.</p>

<h2>Press release</h2>
<p>2023-10-02</p>
<p><a href="http://nobelprizemedicine.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Nobel Assembly at Karolinska Institutet</a></p>
<p>has today decided to award</p>
<p>the 2023 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine</p>
<p>jointly to</p>
<p>Katalin Karikó and Drew Weissman</p>
<p><strong>for their discoveries concerning nucleoside base modifications that enabled the development of effective mRNA vaccines against COVID-19</strong></p>
<p>The discoveries by the two Nobel Laureates were critical for developing effective mRNA vaccines against COVID-19 during the pandemic that began in early 2020. Through their groundbreaking findings, which have fundamentally changed our understanding of how mRNA interacts with our immune system, the laureates contributed to the unprecedented rate of vaccine development during one of the greatest threats to human health in modern times. </p>
<h2>Vaccines before the pandemic</h2>
<p>Vaccination stimulates the formation of an immune response to a particular pathogen. This gives the body a head start in the fight against disease in the event of a later exposure. Vaccines based on killed or weakened viruses have long been available, exemplified by the vaccines against polio, measles, and yellow fever. In 1951, <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/1951/theiler/facts/">Max Theiler</a> was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for developing the yellow fever vaccine.</p>
<p>Thanks to the progress in molecular biology in recent decades, vaccines based on individual viral components, rather than whole viruses, have been developed. Parts of the viral genetic code, usually encoding proteins found on the virus surface, are used to make proteins that stimulate the formation of virus-blocking antibodies. Examples are the vaccines against the hepatitis B virus and human papillomavirus. Alternatively, parts of the viral genetic code can be moved to a harmless carrier virus, a “vector.” This method is used in vaccines against the Ebola virus. When vector vaccines are injected, the selected viral protein is produced in our cells, stimulating an immune response against the targeted virus.</p>
<p>Producing whole virus-, protein- and vector-based vaccines requires large-scale cell culture. This resource-intensive process limits the possibilities for rapid vaccine production in response to outbreaks and pandemics. Therefore, researchers have long attempted to develop vaccine technologies independent of cell culture, but this proved challenging.</p>

<h2>mRNA vaccines: A promising idea</h2>
<p>In our cells, genetic information encoded in DNA is transferred to messenger RNA (mRNA), which is used as a template for protein production. During the 1980s, efficient methods for producing mRNA without cell culture were introduced, called <em>in vitro</em> transcription. This decisive step accelerated the development of molecular biology applications in several fields. Ideas of using mRNA technologies for vaccine and therapeutic purposes also took off, but roadblocks lay ahead. <em>In vitro</em> transcribed mRNA was considered unstable and challenging to deliver, requiring the development of sophisticated carrier lipid systems to encapsulate the mRNA. Moreover, <em>in vitro</em>-produced mRNA gave rise to inflammatory reactions. Enthusiasm for developing the mRNA technology for clinical purposes was, therefore, initially limited.</p>
<p>These obstacles did not discourage the Hungarian biochemist Katalin Karikó, who was devoted to developing methods to use mRNA for therapy. During the early 1990s, when she was an assistant professor at the University of Pennsylvania, she remained true to her vision of realizing mRNA as a therapeutic despite encountering difficulties in convincing research funders of the significance of her project. A new colleague of Karikó at her university was the immunologist Drew Weissman. He was interested in dendritic cells, which have important functions in immune surveillance and the activation of vaccine-induced immune responses. Spurred by new ideas, a fruitful collaboration between the two soon began, focusing on how different RNA types interact with the immune system.</p>
<h2>The breakthrough</h2>
<p>Karikó and Weissman noticed that dendritic cells recognize <em>in vitro</em> transcribed mRNA as a foreign substance, which leads to their activation and the release of inflammatory signaling molecules. They wondered why the in <em>vitro</em> transcribed mRNA was recognized as foreign while mRNA from mammalian cells did not give rise to the same reaction. Karikó and Weissman realized that some critical properties must distinguish the different types of mRNA.</p>
<p>RNA contains four bases, abbreviated A, U, G, and C, corresponding to A, T, G, and C in DNA, the letters of the genetic code. Karikó and Weissman knew that bases in RNA from mammalian cells are frequently chemically modified, while <em>in vitro</em> transcribed mRNA is not. They wondered if the absence of altered bases in the <em>in vitro</em> transcribed RNA could explain the unwanted inflammatory reaction. To investigate this, they produced different variants of mRNA, each with unique chemical alterations in their bases, which they delivered to dendritic cells. The results were striking: The inflammatory response was almost abolished when base modifications were included in the mRNA. This was a paradigm change in our understanding of how cells recognize and respond to different forms of mRNA. Karikó and Weissman immediately understood that their discovery had profound significance for using mRNA as therapy. These seminal results were published in 2005, fifteen years before the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>In further studies published in 2008 and 2010, Karikó and Weissman showed that the delivery of mRNA generated with base modifications markedly increased protein production compared to unmodified mRNA. The effect was due to the reduced activation of an enzyme that regulates protein production. Through their discoveries that base modifications both reduced inflammatory responses and increased protein production, Karikó and Weissman had eliminated critical obstacles on the way to clinical applications of mRNA.</p>
<h2>mRNA vaccines realized their potential</h2>
<p>Interest in mRNA technology began to pick up, and in 2010, several companies were working on developing the method. Vaccines against Zika virus and MERS-CoV were pursued; the latter is closely related to SARS-CoV-2. After the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, two base-modified mRNA vaccines encoding the SARS-CoV-2 surface protein were developed at record speed. Protective effects of around 95% were reported, and both vaccines were approved as early as December 2020.</p>
<p>The impressive flexibility and speed with which mRNA vaccines can be developed pave the way for using the new platform also for vaccines against other infectious diseases. In the future, the technology may also be used to deliver therapeutic proteins and treat some cancer types.</p>
<p>Several other vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, based on different methodologies, were also rapidly introduced, and together, more than 13 billion COVID-19 vaccine doses have been given globally. The vaccines have saved millions of lives and prevented severe disease in many more, allowing societies to open and return to normal conditions. Through their fundamental discoveries of the importance of base modifications in mRNA, this year’s Nobel laureates critically contributed to this transformative development during one of the biggest health crises of our time.</p>

      <article>
        
        <p>Twenty years ago, <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2003/10/08/the-absolute-minimum-every-software-developer-absolutely-positively-must-know-about-unicode-and-character-sets-no-excuses/" target="_blank">Joel Spolsky wrote</a>:</p>
        <blockquote>

        </blockquote>
        <p>A lot has changed in 20 years. In 2003, the main question was: what encoding is this?</p>
        <p>In 2023, it’s no longer a question: with a 98% probability, it’s UTF-8. Finally! We can stick our heads in the sand again!</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/unicode/utf8_trend@2x.png?t=1696253910" width="1024" height="452">        </figure>
        <p>The question now becomes: how do we use UTF-8 correctly? Let’s see!</p>
        <h2>What is Unicode?</h2>
        <p>Unicode is a standard that aims to unify all human languages, both past and present, and make them work with computers.</p>
        <p>In practice, Unicode is a table that assigns unique numbers to different characters. </p>
        <p>For example:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The Latin letter <code>A</code> is assigned the number <code>65</code>.</li>
          <li>The Arabic Letter Seen <code>س</code> is <code>1587</code>.</li>
          <li>The Katakana Letter Tu <code>ツ</code> is <code>12484</code></li>
          <li>The Musical Symbol G Clef <code>𝄞</code> is <code>119070</code>.</li>
          <li><code>💩</code> is <code>128169</code>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Unicode refers to these numbers as <em>code points</em>.</p>
        <p>Since everybody in the world agrees on which numbers correspond to which characters, and we all agree to use Unicode, we can read each other’s texts.</p>
        <p>Unicode == character ⟷ code point.</p>
        <h2>How big is Unicode?</h2>
        <p>Currently, the largest defined code point is 0x10FFFF. That gives us a space of about 1.1 million code points.</p>
        <p>About 170,000, or 15%, are currently defined. An additional 11% are reserved for private use. The rest, about 800,000 code points, are not allocated at the moment. They could become characters in the future.</p>
        <p>Here’s roughly how it looks:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/unicode/overview@2x.png?t=1696253910" width="835" height="725">        </figure>
        <p>Large square == plane == 65,536 characters. Small one == 256 characters. The entire ASCII is half of a small red square in the top left corner.</p>
        <h2>What’s Private Use?</h2>
        <p>These are code points reserved for app developers and will never be defined by Unicode itself.</p>
        <p>For example, there’s no place for the Apple logo in Unicode, so Apple puts it at <code>U+F8FF</code> which is within the Private Use block. In any other font, it’ll render as missing glyph <code>􀣺</code>, but in fonts that ship with macOS, you’ll see <img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/unicode/apple-logo@2x.png?t=1696253910" width="24" height="24">.</p>
        <p>The Private Use Area is mostly used by icon fonts:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/unicode/nerd_font@2x.png?t=1696253910" width="584" height="268"><figcaption>Isn’t it a beauty? It’s all text!</figcaption>        </figure>
        <h2>What does <code>U+1F4A9</code> mean?</h2>
        <p>It’s a convention for how to write code point values. The prefix <code>U+</code> means, well, Unicode, and <code>1F4A9</code> is a code point number in hexadecimal.</p>
        <p>Oh, and <code>U+1F4A9</code> specifically is <code>💩</code>.</p>
        <h2>What’s UTF-8 then?</h2>
        <p>UTF-8 is an encoding. Encoding is how we store code points in memory.</p>
        <p>The simplest possible encoding for Unicode is UTF-32. It simply stores code points as 32-bit integers. So <code>U+1F4A9</code> becomes <code>00 01 F4 A9</code>, taking up four bytes. Any other code point in UTF-32 will also occupy four bytes. Since the highest defined code point is <code>U+10FFFF</code>, any code point is guaranteed to fit.</p>
        <p>UTF-16 and UTF-8 are less straightforward, but the ultimate goal is the same: to take a code point and encode it as bytes.</p>
        <p>Encoding is what you’ll actually deal with as a programmer.</p>
        <h2>How many bytes are in UTF-8?</h2>
        <p>UTF-8 is a variable-length encoding. A code point might be encoded as a sequence of one to four bytes.</p>
        <p>This is how it works:</p>
        <table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Code point</th>
      <th>Byte 1</th>
      <th>Byte 2</th>
      <th>Byte 3</th>
      <th>Byte 4</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>U+<code>0000</code>..<code>007F</code></td>
      <td><code>0xxxxxxx</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>U+<code>0080</code>..<code>07FF</code></td>
      <td><code>110xxxxx</code></td>
      <td><code>10xxxxxx</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>U+<code>0800</code>..<code>FFFF</code></td>
      <td><code>1110xxxx</code></td>
      <td><code>10xxxxxx</code></td>
      <td><code>10xxxxxx</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>U+<code>10000</code>..<code>10FFFF</code></td>
      <td><code>11110xxx</code></td>
      <td><code>10xxxxxx</code></td>
      <td><code>10xxxxxx</code></td>
      <td><code>10xxxxxx</code></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
        <p>If you combine this with the Unicode table, you’ll see that English is encoded with 1 byte, Cyrillic, Latin European languages, Hebrew and Arabic need 2, and Chinese, Japanese, Korean, other Asian languages, and Emoji need 3 or 4.</p>
        <p>A few important points here:</p>
        <p>First, UTF-8 is byte-compatible with ASCII. The code points 0..127, the former ASCII, are encoded with one byte, and it’s the same exact byte. <code>U+0041</code> (<code>A</code>, Latin Capital Letter A) is just <code>41</code>, one byte.</p>
        <p>Any pure ASCII text is also a valid UTF-8 text, and any UTF-8 text that only uses codepoints 0..127 can be read as ASCII directly.</p>
        <p>Second, UTF-8 is space-efficient for basic Latin. That was one of its main selling points over UTF-16. It might not be fair for texts all over the world, but for technical strings like HTML tags or JSON keys, it makes sense.</p>
        <p>On average, UTF-8 tends to be a pretty good deal, even for non-English computers. And for English, there’s no comparison.</p>
        <p>Third, UTF-8 has error detection and recovery built-in. The first byte’s prefix always looks different from bytes 2-4. This way you can always tell if you are looking at a complete and valid sequence of UTF-8 bytes or if something is missing (for example, you jumped it the middle of the sequence). Then you can correct that by moving forward or backward until you find the beginning of the correct sequence.</p>
        <p>And a couple of important consequences:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>You CAN’T determine the length of the string by counting bytes.</li>
          <li>You CAN’T randomly jump into the middle of the string and start reading.</li>
          <li>You CAN’T get a substring by cutting at arbitrary byte offsets. You might cut off part of the character.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Those who do will eventually meet this bad boy: �</p>
        <h2>What’s �?</h2>
        <p><code>U+FFFD</code>, the Replacement Character, is simply another code point in the Unicode table. Apps and libraries can use it when they detect Unicode errors.</p>
        <p>If you cut half of the code point off, there’s not much left to do with the other half, except displaying an error. That’s when � is used.</p>
        <pre><code>var bytes = "Аналитика".getBytes("UTF-8");
var partial = Arrays.copyOfRange(bytes, 0, 11);
new String(partial, "UTF-8"); // =&gt; "Анал�"</code></pre>
        <h2>Wouldn’t UTF-32 be easier for everything?</h2>
        <p>NO.</p>
        <p>UTF-32 is great for operating on code points. Indeed, if every code point is always 4 bytes, then <code>strlen(s) == sizeof(s) / 4</code>, <code>substring(0, 3) == bytes[0, 12]</code>, etc.</p>
        <p>The problem is, you don’t want to operate on code points. A code point is not a unit of writing; one code point is not always a single character. What you should be iterating on is called “<strong>extended grapheme clusters</strong>”, or graphemes for short.</p>
        <p>A grapheme is a minimally distinctive unit of writing in the context of a particular writing system. <code>ö</code> is one grapheme. <code>é</code> is one too. And <code>각</code>. Basically, grapheme is what the user thinks of as a single character.</p>
        <p>The problem is, in Unicode, some graphemes are encoded with multiple code points!</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/unicode/graphemes@2x.png?t=1696253910" width="600" height="340">        </figure>
        <p>For example, <code>é</code> (a single grapheme) is encoded in Unicode as <code>e</code> (U+0065 Latin Small Letter E) + <code>´</code> (U+0301 Combining Acute Accent). Two code points!</p>
        <p>It can also be more than two:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>☹️</code> is <code>U+2639</code> + <code>U+FE0F</code></li>
          <li><code>👨‍🏭</code> is <code>U+1F468</code> + <code>U+200D</code> + <code>U+1F3ED</code></li>
          <li><code>🚵🏻‍♀️</code> is <code>U+1F6B5</code> + <code>U+1F3FB</code> + <code>U+200D</code> + <code>U+2640</code> + <code>U+FE0F</code></li>
          <li><code>y̖̠͍̘͇͗̏̽̎͞</code> is <code>U+0079</code> + <code>U+0316</code> + <code>U+0320</code> + <code>U+034D</code> + <code>U+0318</code> + <code>U+0347</code> + <code>U+0357</code> + <code>U+030F</code> + <code>U+033D</code> + <code>U+030E</code> + <code>U+035E</code></li>
        </ul>
        <p>There’s no limit, as far as I know.</p>
        <p>Remember, we are talking about code points here. Even in the widest encoding, UTF-32, <code>👨‍🏭</code> will still take three 4-byte units to encode. And it still needs to be treated as a single character.</p>
        <p>If the analogy helps, we can think of the Unicode itself (without any encodings) as being variable-length.</p>
        <p>An Extended Grapheme Cluster is a sequence of one or more Unicode code points that must be treatead as a single, unbreakable character.</p>
        <p>Therefore, we get all the problems we have with variable-length encodings, but now on code point level: you can’t take only a part of the sequence, it always should be selected, copied, edited, or deleted as a whole.</p>
        <p>Failure to respect grapheme clusters leads to bugs like this:</p>
        <figure>

          </video>
<figcaption>Just to be clear: this is NOT correct behavior</figcaption>        </figure>
        <p>Using UTF-32 instead of UTF-8 will not make your life any easier in regards to extended grapheme clusters. And extended grapheme clusters is what you should care about.</p>
        <p>Code points — 🥱. Graphemes — 😍</p>
        <h2>Is Unicode hard only because of emojis?</h2>
        <p>Not really. Extended Grapheme Clusters are also used for alive, actively used languages. For example:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>ö</code> (German) is a single character, but multiple code points (<code>U+006F U+0308</code>).</li>
          <li><code>ą́</code> (Lithuanian) is <code>U+00E1 U+0328</code>.</li>
          <li><code>각</code> (Korean) is <code>U+1100 U+1161 U+11A8</code>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>So no, it’s not just about emojis.</p>
        <h2>What’s "🤦🏼‍♂️".length?</h2>
        <p>The question is inspired by <a href="https://hsivonen.fi/string-length/" target="_blank">this brilliant article</a>.</p>
        <p>Different programming languages will happily give you different answers.</p>
        <p>Python 3:</p>
        <pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; len("🤦🏼‍♂️")
5</code></pre>
        <p>JavaScript / Java / C#:</p>
        <pre><code>&gt;&gt; "🤦🏼‍♂️".length 
7</code></pre>
        <p>Rust:</p>
        <pre><code>println!("{}", "🤦🏼‍♂️".len());
// =&gt; 17</code></pre>
        <p>As you can guess, different languages use different internal string representations (UTF-32, UTF-16, UTF-8) and report length in whatever units they store characters in (ints, shorts, bytes).</p>
        <p>BUT! If you ask any normal person, one that isn’t burdened with computer internals, they’ll give you a straight answer: 1. The length of <code>🤦🏼‍♂️</code> string is 1.</p>
        <p>That’s what extended grapheme clusters are all about: what <em>humans</em> perceive as a single character. And in this case, <code>🤦🏼‍♂️</code> is undoubtedly a single character.</p>
        <p>The fact that <code>🤦🏼‍♂️</code> consists of 5 code points (<code>U+1F926 U+1F3FB U+200D U+2642 U+FE0F</code>) is mere implementation detail. It should not be broken apart, it should not be counted as multiple characters, the text cursor should not be positioned inside it, it shouldn’t be partially selected, etc.</p>
        <p>For all intents and purposes, this is an atomic unit of text. Internally, it could be encoded whatever, but for user-facing API, it should be treated as a whole.</p>
        <p>The only modern language that gets it right is Swift:</p>
        <pre><code>print("🤦🏼‍♂️".count)
// =&gt; 1</code></pre>
        <p>Basically, there are two layers:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Internal, computer-oriented. How to copy strings, send them over the network, store on disk, etc. This is where you need encodings like UTF-8. Swift uses UTF-8 internally, but it might as well be UTF-16 or UTF-32. What's important is that you only use it to copy strings as a whole and never to analyze their content.</li>
          <li>External, human-facing API. Character count in UI. Taking first 10 characters to generate preview. Searching in text. Methods like <code>.count</code> or <code>.substring</code>. Swift gives you <em>a view</em> that pretends the string is a sequence of grapheme clusters. And that view behaves like any human would expect: it gives you 1 for <code>"🤦🏼‍♂️".count</code>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>I hope more languages adopt this design soon.</p>
        <p>Question to the reader: what to you think <code>"ẇ͓̞͒͟͡ǫ̠̠̉̏͠͡ͅr̬̺͚̍͛̔͒͢d̠͎̗̳͇͆̋̊͂͐".length</code> should be?</p>
        <h2>How do I detect extended grapheme clusters then?</h2>
        <p>Unfortunately, most languages choose the easy way out and let you iterate through strings with 1-2-4-byte chunks, but not with grapheme clusters.</p>
        <p>It makes no sense and has no semantics, but since it’s the default, programmers don’t think twice, and we see corrupted strings as the result:</p>
        <figure>

        <p>“I know, I’ll use a library to do strlen()!” — nobody, ever.</p>
        <p>But that’s exactly what you should be doing! Use a proper Unicode library! Yes, for basic stuff like <code>strlen</code> or <code>indexOf</code> or <code>substring</code>!</p>
        <p>For example:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>C/C++/Java: use <a href="https://github.com/unicode-org/icu" target="_blank">ICU</a>. It’s a library from Unicode itself that encodes all the rules about text segmentation.</li>
          <li>C#: use <code>TextElementEnumerator</code>, which is kept up to date with Unicode as far as I can tell.</li>
          <li>Swift: just stdlib. Swift does the right thing by default.</li>
          <li>For other languages, there’s probably a library or binding for ICU.</li>
          <li>Roll your own. Unicode <a href="https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr29/#Grapheme_Cluster_Boundaries" target="_blank">publishes</a> rules and tables in a machine-readable format, and all the libraries above are based on them.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>But whatever you choose, make sure it’s on the recent enough version of Unicode (15.1 at the moment of writing), because the definition of graphemes changes from version to version. For example, Java’s <code>java.text.BreakIterator</code> is a no-go: it’s based on a very old version of Unicode and not updated.</p>
        <p>Use a library</p>
        <p>IMO, the whole situation is a shame. Unicode should be in the stdlib of every language by default. It’s the lingua franca of the internet! It’s not even new: we’ve been living with Unicode for 20 years now.</p>
        <h2>Wait, rules are changing?</h2>
        <p>Yes! Ain’t it cool?</p>
        <p>(I know, it ain’t)</p>
        <p>Starting roughly in 2014, Unicode has been releasing a major revision of their standard every year. This is where you get your new emojis from — Android and iOS updates in the Fall usually include the newest Unicode standard among other things.</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/unicode/versions@2x.png?t=1696253910" width="300" height="620">        </figure>
        <p>What’s sad for us is that the rules defining grapheme clusters change every year as well. What is considered a sequence of two or three separate code points today might become a grapheme cluster tomorrow! There’s no way to know! Or prepare!</p>
        <p>Even worse, different versions of your own app might be running on different Unicode standards and report different string lengths!</p>
        <p>But that’s the reality we live in. You don’t really have a choice here. You can’t ignore Unicode or Unicode updates if you want to stay relevant and provide a decent user experience. So, buckle up, embrace, and update.</p>
        <p>Update yearly</p>
        <h2>Why is "Å" !== "Å" !== "Å"?</h2>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/unicode/spider_men@2x.jpg?t=1696253910" width="600" height="300">        </figure>
        <p>Copy any of these to your JavaScript console:</p>
        <pre><code>"Å" === "Å"
"Å" === "Å"
"Å" === "Å"</code></pre>
        <p>What do you get? False? You should get false, and it’s not a mistake.</p>
        <p>Remember earlier when I said that <code>ö</code> is two code points, <code>U+006F U+0308</code>? Basically, Unicode offers more than one way to write characters like <code>ö</code> or <code>Å</code>. You can:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Compose <code>Å</code> from normal Latin <code>A</code> + a combining character,</li>
          <li>OR there’s also a pre-composed code point <code>U+00C5</code> that does that for you.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>They will look the same (<code>Å</code> vs <code>Å</code>), they should work the same, and for all intents and purposes, they are considered exactly the same. The only difference is the byte representation.</p>
        <p>That’s why we need normalization. There are four forms:</p>
        <p><strong>NFD</strong> tries to explode everything to the smallest possible pieces, and also sorts pieces in a canonical order if there is more than one.</p>
        <p><strong>NFC</strong>, on the other hand, tries to combine everything into pre-composed form if one exists.</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/unicode/normalization@2x.png?t=1696253910" width="600" height="300">        </figure>
        <p>For some characters there are also multiple versions of them in Unicode. For example, there’s <code>U+00C5 Latin Capital Letter A with Ring Above</code>, but there’s also <code>U+212B Angstrom Sign</code> which looks the same. </p>
        <p>These are also replaced during normalization:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/unicode/normalization_clones@2x.png?t=1696253910" width="600" height="180">        </figure>
        <p>NFD and NFC are called “canonical normalization”. Another two forms are “compatibility normalization”:</p>
        <p><strong>NFKD</strong> tries to explode everything and replaces visual variants with default ones.</p>
        <p><strong>NFKC</strong> tries to combine everything while replacing visual variants with default ones.</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/unicode/normalization_compat@2x.png?t=1696253910" width="600" height="400">        </figure>
        <p>Visual variants are separate Unicode code points that represent the same character but are supposed to render differently. Like, <code>①</code> or <code>⁹</code> or <code>𝕏</code>. We want to be able to find both <code>"x"</code> and <code>"2"</code> in a string like <code>"𝕏²"</code>, don’t we?</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/unicode/x_variants@2x.png?t=1696253910" width="438" height="185"><figcaption>All of these have their own code points, but they are also all Xs</figcaption>        </figure>
        <p>Why does the <code>ﬁ</code> ligature even have its own code point? No idea. A lot can happen in a million characters.</p>
        <p>Before comparing strings or searching for a substring, normalize!</p>
        <h2>Unicode is locale-dependent</h2>
        <p>The Russian name Nikolay is written like this:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/unicode/nikolay_ru.png?t=1696253910" width="600" height="150">        </figure>
        <p>and encoded in Unicode as <code>U+041D 0438 043A 043E 043B 0430 0439</code>.</p>
        <p>The Bulgarian name Nikolay is written:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/unicode/nikolay_bg.png?t=1696253910" width="600" height="150">        </figure>
        <p>and encoded in Unicode as <code>U+041D 0438 043A 043E 043B 0430 0439</code>. Exactly the same!</p>
        <p>Wait a second! How does the computer know when to render Bulgarian-style glyphs and when to use Russian ones?</p>
        <p>Short answer: it doesn’t. Unfortunately, Unicode is not a perfect system, and it has many shortcomings. Among them is assigning the same code point to glyphs that are supposed to look differently, like Cyrillic Lowercase K and Bulgarian Lowercase K (both are <code>U+043A</code>).</p>
        <p>From what I understand, Asian people <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_unification" target="_blank">get it much worse</a>: many Chinese, Japanese, and Korean logograms that are written very differently get assigned the same code point:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/unicode/han.png?t=1696253910" width="600" height="149"><figcaption>U+8FD4 in different locales</figcaption>        </figure>
        <p>Unicode motivation is to save code points space (my guess). Information on how to render is supposed to be transferred outside of the string, as locale/language metadata.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, it fails the original goal of Unicode:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>[...] no escape sequence or control code is required to specify any character in any language.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>In practice, dependency on locale brings a lot of problems:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Being metadata, locale often gets lost.</li>
          <li>People are not limited to a single locale. For example, I can read and write English (USA), English (UK), German, and Russian. Which locale should I set my computer to?</li>
          <li>It’s hard to mix and match. Like Russian names in Bulgarian text or vice versa. Why not? It’s the internet, people from all cultures hang out here.</li>
          <li>There’s no place to specify the locale. Even making the two screenshots above was non-trivial because in most software, there’s no dropdown or text input to change locale.</li>
          <li>When needed, it had to be guessed. For example, Twitter tries to guess the locale from the text of the tweet itself (because where else could it get it from?) and sometimes gets it wrong:</li>
        </ol>
        <figure>
<a href="https://twitter.com/nikitonsky/status/1171115067112398849" target="_blank"><img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/unicode/twitter_locale.jpg?t=1696253910" width="597" height="422"></a>        </figure>
        <h2>Why does <code>String::toLowerCase()</code> accepts Locale as an argument?</h2>
        <p>Another unfortunate example of locale dependence is the Unicode handling of dotless <code>i</code> in the Turkish language.</p>
        <p>Unlike English, Turks have two <code>I</code> variants: dotted and dotless. Unicode decided to reuse <code>I</code> and <code>i</code> from ASCII and only add two new code points: <code>İ</code> and <code>ı</code>.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, that made <code>toLowerCase</code>/<code>toUpperCase</code> behave differently on the same input:</p>
        <pre><code>var en_US = Locale.of("en", "US");
var tr = Locale.of("tr");

"I".toLowerCase(en_US); // =&gt; "i"
"I".toLowerCase(tr);    // =&gt; "ı"

"i".toUpperCase(en_US); // =&gt; "I"
"i".toUpperCase(tr);    // =&gt; "İ"</code></pre>
        <p>So no, you can’t convert string to lowercase without knowing what language that string is written in.</p>
        <h2>I live in the US/UK, should I even care?</h2>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/unicode/english@2x.png?t=1696253910" width="600" height="67">        </figure>
        <ul>
          <li>quotation marks <code>“</code> <code>”</code> <code>‘</code> <code>’</code>, </li>
          <li>apostrophe <code>’</code>,</li>
          <li>dashes <code>–</code> <code>—</code>,</li>
          <li>different variations of spaces (figure, hair, non-breaking),</li>
          <li>bullets <code>•</code> <code>■</code> <code>☞</code>,</li>
          <li>currency symbols other than the <code>$</code> (kind of tells you who invented computers, doesn’t it?): <code>€</code> <code>¢</code> <code>£</code>,</li>
          <li>mathematical signs—plus <code>+</code> and equals <code>=</code> are part of ASCII, but minus <code>−</code> and multiply <code>×</code> are not <span>¯\_(ツ)_/¯</span>,</li>
          <li>various other signs <code>©</code> <code>™</code> <code>¶</code> <code>†</code> <code>§</code>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Hell, you can’t even spell <code>café</code>, <code>piñata</code>, or <code>naïve</code> without Unicode. So yes, we are all in it together, even Americans.</p>
        <p>Touché.</p>
        <h2>What are surrogate pairs?</h2>
        <p>That goes back to Unicode v1. The first version of Unicode was supposed to be fixed-width. A 16-bit fixed width, to be exact:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/unicode/unicode1@2x.png?t=1696253910" width="700" height="465"><figcaption>Version 1.0 of the Unicode Standard, October 1991</figcaption>        </figure>
        <p>They believed 65,536 characters would be enough for all human languages. They were almost right!</p>
        <p>When they realized they needed more code points, UCS-2 (an original version of UTF-16 without surrogates) was already used in many systems. 16 bit, fixed-width, it only gives you 65,536 characters. What can you do?</p>
        <p>Unicode decided to allocate some of these 65,536 characters to encode higher code points, essentially converting fixed-width UCS-2 into variable-width UTF-16.</p>
        <p>A surrogate pair is two UTF-16 units used to encode a single Unicode code point. For example, <code>D83D DCA9</code> (two 16-bit units) encodes <em>one</em> code point, <code>U+1F4A9</code>.</p>
        <p>The top 6 bits in surrogate pairs are used for the mask, leaving 2×10 free bits to spare:</p>
        <pre><code>   High Surrogate          Low Surrogate
        D800        ++          DC00
1101 10?? ???? ???? ++ 1101 11?? ???? ????</code></pre>
        <p>Technically, both halves of the surrogate pair can be seen as Unicode code points, too. In practice, the whole range from <code>U+D800</code> to <code>U+DFFF</code> is allocated as “for surrogate pairs only”. Code points from there are not even considered valid in any other encodings.</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/unicode/bmp@2x.png?t=1696253910" width="556" height="373"><figcaption>This space on a very crammed Basic Multilingual Plane will never be used for anything good ever again</figcaption>        </figure>
        <h2>Is UTF-16 still alive?</h2>
        <p>Yes!</p>
        <p>The promise of a fixed-width encoding that covers all human languages was so compelling that many systems were eager to adopt it. Among them were Microsoft Windows, Objective-C, Java, JavaScript, .NET, Python 2, QT, SMS, and CD-ROM!</p>
        <p>Since then, Python has moved on, CD-ROM has become obsolete, but the rest is stuck with UTF-16 or even UCS-2. So UTF-16 lives there as in-memory representation.</p>
        <p>In practical terms today, UTF-16 has roughly the same usability as UTF-8. It’s also variable-length; counting UTF-16 units is as useless as counting bytes or code points, grapheme clusters are still a pain, etc. The only difference is memory requirements.</p>
        <p>The only downside of UTF-16 is that everything else is UTF-8, so it requires conversion every time a string is read from the network or from disk.</p>
        <p>Also, fun fact: the number of planes Unicode has (17) is defined by how much you can express with surrogate pairs in UTF-16.</p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>To sum it up:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Unicode has won.</li>
          <li>UTF-8 is the most popular encoding for data in transfer and at rest.</li>
          <li>UTF-16 is still sometimes used as an in-memory representation.</li>
          <li>The two most important views for strings are bytes (allocate memory/copy/encode/decode) and extended grapheme clusters (all semantic operations).</li>
          <li>Using code points for iterating over a string is wrong. They are not the basic unit of writing. One grapheme could consist of multiple code points.</li>
          <li>To detect grapheme boundaries, you need Unicode tables.</li>
          <li>Use a Unicode library for everything Unicode, even boring stuff like <code>strlen</code>, <code>indexOf</code> and <code>substring</code>.</li>
          <li>Unicode updates every year, and rules sometimes change.</li>
          <li>Unicode strings need to be normalized before they can be compared.</li>
          <li>Unicode depends on locale for some operations and for rendering.</li>
          <li>All this is important even for pure English text.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Overall, yes, Unicode is not perfect, but the fact that</p>
        <ol>
          <li>an encoding exists that covers all possible languages at once,</li>
          <li>the entire world agrees to use it,</li>
          <li>we can completely forget about encodings and conversions and all that stuff</li>
        </ol>
        <p>is a miracle. Send this to your fellow programmers so they can learn about it, too.</p>
        <p>There’s such a thing as plain text, and it’s encoded with UTF-8.</p>

</figure>



<p><strong>Installing the proxy:</strong></p>



<p>Download surl-server-buster-YYYY-MM-DD-lite.img.gz from the <a href="https://github.com/colinleroy/a2tools/releases">Github Releases page</a>.</p>



<p>Uncompress it and copy it to a micro-SD card. You can do it using command-line on most platforms, or use a tool like <a href="https://etcher.balena.io/#download-etcher">Balena Etcher</a> to do it interactively. Here is how to do it via command-line (substitute YYYY-MM-DD for the file you downloaded, and /dev/mmcblk0 for your microSD’s device file):</p>



<pre><code>gunzip surl-server-buster-YYYY-MM-DD-lite.img.gz
sudo dd if=surl-server-buster-YYYY-MM-DD-lite.img of=/dev/mmcblk0</code></pre>



<p>You can now insert the microSD card in a Raspberry, plug it into your Ethernet network, and put it away for now.</p>



<p><strong>Transferring the floppy</strong>:</p>



<p>Download the floppy image from the <a href="https://github.com/colinleroy/a2tools/releases">Github Releases page</a>. Use the image corresponding to your Apple II:</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td>Apple II model</td><td>Floppy image</td></tr><tr><td>][+, IIe without a 80-column card</td><td>mastodon-oldii.dsk</td></tr><tr><td>IIgs</td><td>mastodon-iigs.dsk</td></tr><tr><td>//c, //c+, IIe enhanced or platinum</td><td>mastodon.dsk</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Download ADTPro from <a href="https://github.com/ADTPro/adtpro/releases">ADTPro’s releases page</a>, and install it.</p>



<p>Put the <code>mastodon.dsk</code> file in ADTPro’s <code>disks/</code> subdirectory.</p>



<p>(Note: there is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xworYThmMI">very good video documenting the following process</a>, if you prefer this format).</p>



<p>Get a DIN-5 to DB-9 null modem cable (<a href="https://retrofloppy.com/products/#SerialCables">from RetroFloppy for example</a>, <a href="https://www.8bitclassics.com/product/apple-iic-5-pin-din-to-db9-adtpro-compatible-serial-cable/">from 8bitclassics</a>, or on Ebay), and a DB-9 to USB serial adapter (<a href="https://retrofloppy.com/products/#USB">from RetroFloppy for example</a>, or just about any other place. Some chipsets are better than others and an FTDI-based cable will work great).</p>



<p>Connect your Apple II to your modern computer via the serial cables, then turn on the Apple II without a floppy. Get to BASIC prompt, pressing Ctrl-Reset if necessary, then type: </p>



<pre><code>IN#2</code></pre>



<p>The number here depends on where your cable is plugged: On an Apple //c, it’s 2 for the modem port, 1 for the printer port. On an Apple IIe, it depends on your Super Serial Card’s installation slot.</p>



<p>You can now configure the serial port on the Apple II: At the command prompt, type <code>Ctrl-A</code>, then, without typing Enter, space or anything, continue with <code>14B</code>. This is all.</p>



<p>On your modern computer, start ADTPro. Click on the Serial button; select your serial port (usually COM1 on Windows, ttyUSB0 on Linux). Click Bootstrapping / ProDOS / Speediboot. You will see ADTPro suggests to perform the Apple II setup we just did, so you can click OK.</p>



<p>Once the bootstrapping is done (a few minutes), the Apple II ADTPro client will open. You can now insert a blank floppy disk in the Apple II, then hit <code>R</code> to receive a disk image, then either type <code>MASTODON.DSK</code>, or Enter to get the list of available disk images and select <code>MASTODON.DSK</code>. </p>



<p>(Note: if you plan on using ADTPro for more, you can and should create an ADTPro floppy too, to avoid all the bootstrapping in the future. Just receive the <code>ADTPRO-2.1.0.DSK</code> file to a floppy).</p>



<p>Your Mastodon floppy is now ready. You can unplug the serial cable from your PC, plug it into the Raspberry, and boot the Raspberry.</p>



<p>You can now reset the Apple II (either by turning it off and on, or via Ctrl-Open-Apple-Reset), and login into your Mastodon instance!</p>



<p><strong>Final step: enjoy!</strong></p>



<p>After this, everything should work. If not, log onto the Raspberry using ssh and the pi/raspberry login. You can investigate the logs in /var/log/syslog.</p>



<p>Once in the Mastodon application on the Apple 2, make sure to configure it (using the O key) if you have a french keyboard, for charset conversion to/from UTF-8 (and I’d be glad to add other layouts if you know their charsets!), and configure the image conversion algorithm for monochrome or color monitors.</p>



<p><strong>Upgrading:</strong></p>



<p>If you want to upgrade following a new release, you will have to re-transfer a floppy image using ADTPro. For the proxy part, you can either start fresh with a new Raspberry image, or ssh into your existing Pi to upgrade the package:</p>



<pre><code>ssh pi@&lt;ip-address-of-the-pi&gt;
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install --reinstall surl-server</code></pre>



<p><strong>Troubleshooting:</strong></p>



<p>If you have serial communication issues, you can try lowering the serial speed in the proxy’s <code>/etc/a2tools/tty.conf</code> file – although the default 19.2kbps should be completely safe. After changing this configuration file, restart the proxy service using </p>



<pre><code>sudo systemctl restart surl-server.service</code></pre>



<p>You can also try to change the serial port you use on your Apple II. The Mastodon client will suggest reconfiguring the default serial settings at startup, if it can not connect to the proxy.</p>



<p>Note: The serial speed has been upgraded from 9600bps to 19200bps at release <strong>1.5.0</strong>. Make sure to update the surl-server settings in <code>/etc/a2tools/tty.conf</code>.</p>



<p>Note: By default, the surl-server proxy on the Raspberry runs without hardware line handshaking, which is not ideal for the Apple II, but is the most compatible solution: hardware handshaking support depends on your adapter cable. If you know it supports it, or want to give it a test, update <code>/etc/a2tools/tty.conf</code> and set <code>hw_handshake: on</code>. Then restart the service using: </p>



<p><code>sudo systemctl restart surl-server.service</code></p>



<p>If you have questions or suggestions, I’d be happy to hear from you, either <a href="https://www.colino.net/wordpress/contact/">by email</a> or <a href="https://piaille.fr/@colin_mcmillen">on Mastodon</a>.</p>

It's so easy, in fact, that one would think that creating new databases from existing databases would be easy, too. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/876522/creating-a-copy-of-a-database-in-postgresql" rel="nofollow">But it's not</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Postgres provides the option to create one database from another using <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createdatabase.html" rel="nofollow"><code>CREATE DATABASE name [WITH] [TEMPLATE template]</code></a>, but doing so has two major restrictions:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>there can be <em>no active connections to the <code>template</code> database</em>, and...</li>
<li>performance degrades rapidly as the size of the database increases</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto"><code>pg_branch</code> is a Postgres extension that solves those problems by giving <code>CREATE DATABASE</code> the power of snapshots. If your <code>PGDATA</code> directory is on a copy-on-write file system like <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/btrfs" rel="nofollow"><code>BTRFS</code></a>, the <code>pg_branch</code> extension turns every <code>CREATE DATABASE</code> into an atomic file system snapshot that takes seconds instead of minutes (or hours). In addition, the copy-on-write strategy keeps disk usage low by only writing new segment data files to disk when they're modified (rather than read).</p>
<p dir="auto">TL;DR: <code>CREATE EXTENSION pg_branch</code> makes <code>CREATE DATABASE &lt;dbname&gt; WITH TEMPLATE &lt;bigdbname&gt;</code> super fast</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-getting-started" dir="auto"><a href="#getting-started">Getting Started</a></h2>
<p dir="auto">Before installing <code>pg_branch</code>, it's important to configure the file system that the database cluster will use. The following steps will get you started:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: these steps are written with Linux in mind, and have only been testing on Linux.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="0" dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>install prerequisites</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">You'll need an installation of <code>btrfs</code> (usually packaged as <code>btrfs-progs</code>) as well as an up-to-date <a href="https://rustup.rs/" rel="nofollow">Rust toolchain</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/pgcentralfoundation/pgrx/blob/master/cargo-pgrx/README.md#cargo-pgrx"><code>pgrx</code> subcommand for <code>cargo</code></a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>format a disk as BTRFS</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">The easiest thing to do here is plug in a USB and check which disk it is with <code>lsblk</code>. Once you've figure out which disk you'd like to reformat, you can do so with:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="sudo mkfs.btrfs /dev/sdX # replace sdX with your drive"><pre>sudo mkfs.btrfs /dev/sdX <span><span>#</span> replace sdX with your drive</span></pre></div>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>mount your <code>btrfs</code>-formatted disk</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">You need a directory to mount this disk to, first. Something like:</p>

<p dir="auto">...which you can then use as a mount point for your new <code>btrfs</code> drive with:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="sudo mount /dev/sdX /mnt/database"><pre>sudo mount /dev/sdX /mnt/database</pre></div>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>intialize a Postgres cluster on your mounted disk</strong></p>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://github.com/pgcentralfoundation/pgrx/blob/master/cargo-pgrx/README.md#cargo-pgrx"><code>cargo pgrx</code> can take care of initialization</a> as long as it knows where to initialize the data through the <code>PGRX_HOME</code> variable. Something like:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="PGRX_HOME=/mnt/database cargo pgrx init"><pre>PGRX_HOME=/mnt/database cargo pgrx init</pre></div>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>clone this repo</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">The rest of these steps will be done from within this repo, so make sure you've run <code>git clone git@github.com:NAlexPear/pg_branch.git</code> and <code>cd pg_branch</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>convert all segment data directories to subvolumes</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Before <code>pg_branch</code> can take over database creation, the subdirectories in the newly-initialized data directory of your database need to be converted to <code>btrfs</code> subvolumes. This repo provides an <code>init.sh</code> script for doing just this that, as long as it's provided a <code>PGDATA</code> variable that points to the data directory of your cluster.</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>pgrx</code> data directories have a structure of <code>$PGRX_HOME/data-$PG_VERSION</code>. So if you initialized your project as instructed in step 3, you should be able to run the <code>init.sh</code> script in this repository like so:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="PGDATA=/mnt/database/data-15 ./init.sh"><pre>PGDATA=/mnt/database/data-15 ./init.sh</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">...and you should have successfully converted all of the initial databases in your cluster to subvolumes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>get into <code>psql</code></strong></p>
<p dir="auto">The quickest way to jump into a <code>psql</code> session that recognizes <code>pg_branch</code> is to run the following:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="PGX_HOME=/your/mounted/btrfs/disk cargo pgrx run"><pre>PGX_HOME=/your/mounted/btrfs/disk cargo pgrx run</pre></div>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>create the extension in <code>psql</code> with <code>CREATE EXTENSION pg_branch</code></strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>create some databases</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">After creating the extension, you can run <code>CREATE DATABASE &lt;dbname&gt; WITH TEMPLATE &lt;template_dbname&gt;</code> commands to quickly and atomically copy databases without requiring an exclusive lock or dedicated connection. To use the default <code>CREATE DATABASE</code> behavior again, pick an explicit <code>STRATEGY</code> other than <code>SNAPSHOT</code> (i.e. <code>WAL_COPY</code> or <code>FILE_COPY</code>).</p>

<p><u>The Heat Initiative,</u> a nonprofit child safety advocacy group, was formed earlier this year to campaign against some of the strong privacy protections Apple provides customers. The group says these protections help enable child exploitation, objecting to the fact that pedophiles can encrypt their personal data just like everyone else.</p>



<p>When Apple launched its new iPhone this September, the Heat Initiative seized on the occasion, taking out a full-page New York Times ad, using digital billboard trucks, and even hiring a plane to fly over Apple headquarters with a banner message. The message on the banner appeared simple: “Dear Apple, Detect Child Sexual Abuse in iCloud” — Apple’s cloud storage system, which today employs a range of powerful encryption technologies aimed at preventing hackers, spies, and Tim Cook from knowing anything about your private files.</p>



<p>Something the Heat Initiative has not placed on giant airborne banners is who’s behind it: a controversial billionaire philanthropy network whose influence and tactics have drawn unfavorable comparisons to the right-wing Koch network. Though it does not publicize this fact, the Heat Initiative is a project of the Hopewell Fund, an organization that helps privately and often secretly direct the largesse — and political will — of billionaires. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/29/us/politics/democrats-dark-money-donors.html">Hopewell is part of a giant, tightly connected web</a> of largely anonymous, Democratic Party-aligned dark-money groups, in an ironic turn, campaigning to undermine the privacy of ordinary people.</p>



<!-- BLOCK(pullquote)[0](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PULLQUOTE%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22pull%22%3A%22right%22%7D) --><blockquote data-shortcode-type="pullquote" data-pull="right"><!-- CONTENT(pullquote)[0] -->“None of these groups are particularly open with me or other people who are tracking dark money about what it is they’re doing.”<!-- END-CONTENT(pullquote)[0] --></blockquote><!-- END-BLOCK(pullquote)[0] -->



<p>For experts on transparency about money in politics, the Hopewell Fund’s place in the wider network of Democratic dark money raises questions that groups in the network are disinclined to answer.</p>



<p>“None of these groups are particularly open with me or other people who are tracking dark money about what it is they’re doing,” said Robert Maguire, of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, or CREW. Maguire said the way the network operated called to mind perhaps the most famous right-wing philanthropy and dark-money political network: the constellation of groups run and supported by the billionaire owners of Koch Industries. Of the Hopewell network, Maguire said, “They also take on some of the structural calling cards of the Koch network; it is a convoluted group, sometimes even intentionally so.”</p>



<p>The decadeslong political and technological campaign to diminish encryption for the sake of public safety — known as the “Crypto Wars” — has in recent years pivoted from stoking fears of terrorists chatting in secret to child predators evading police scrutiny. No matter the subject area, the battle is being waged between those who think privacy is an absolute right and those who believe it ought to be limited for expanded oversight from law enforcement and intelligence agencies. The ideological lines pit privacy advocates, computer scientists, and cryptographers against the FBI, the U.S. Congress, the European Union, and other governmental bodies around the world. Apple’s complex 2021 proposal to scan cloud-bound images before they ever left your phone became <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/apple-csam-detection-icloud-photos-encryption-privacy/">divisive even within the field of cryptography itself</a>.</p>



<!-- BLOCK(newsletter)[1](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22NEWSLETTER%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) -->

<!-- END-BLOCK(newsletter)[1] -->



<p>While the motives on both sides tend to be clear — there’s little mystery as to why the FBI doesn’t like encryption — the Heat Initiative, as opaque as it is new, introduces the obscured interests of billionaires to a dispute over the rights of ordinary individuals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I’m uncomfortable with anonymous rich people with unknown agendas pushing these massive invasions of our privacy,” Matthew Green, a cryptographer at Johns Hopkins University and a critic of the plan to have Apple scan private files on its devices, told The Intercept. “There are huge implications for national security as well as consumer privacy against corporations. Plenty of unsavory reasons for people to push this technology that have nothing to do with protecting children.”</p>

<h2 id="h-apple-s-aborted-scanning-scheme">Apple’s Aborted Scanning Scheme</h2>



<p>Last month, Wired <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/apple-csam-scanning-heat-initiative-letter/">reported</a> the previously unknown Heat Initiative was pressing Apple to reconsider its highly controversial 2021 proposal to have iPhones constantly scan their owners’ photos as they were uploaded to iCloud, checking to see if they were in possession of child sexual abuse material, known as CSAM. If a scan turned up CSAM, police would be alerted. While most large internet companies check files their users upload and share against a centralized database of known CSAM, Apple’s plan went a step further, proposing to check for illegal files not just on the company’s servers, but directly on its customers’ phones.</p>



<p>“In the hierarchy of human privacy, your private files and photos should be your most important confidential possessions,” Green said. “We even wrote this into the U.S. Constitution.”</p>



<p>The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/18/apples-csam-detection-tech-is-under-fire-again/">backlash</a> was <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/08/19/apple-csam-abuse-encryption-security-privacy-dangerous/">swift</a> and effective. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/11/opinion/apple-iphones-privacy.html">Computer scientists, cryptographers</a>,<a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/08/apples-plan-think-different-about-encryption-opens-backdoor-your-private-life"> digital rights advocates</a>, and <a href="https://www.aclu.org/news/privacy-technology/apples-new-child-safety-plan-for-iphones-isnt-so-safe">civil libertarians</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632722/apple-child-abuse-scan-ios-abandon-request-privacy">immediately protested</a>, claiming the scanning would create a deeply dangerous precedent. The ability to scan users’ devices could open up iPhones around the world to snooping by authoritarian governments, hackers, <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/laliga-talks-to-google-about-piracy-apps-from-a-million-phones-230924/">corporations</a>, and security agencies. A year later, Apple reversed course and said it was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/7/23498588/apple-csam-icloud-photos-scanning-encryption">shelving</a> the idea.</p>



<p>Green said that efforts to push Apple to monitor the private files of iPhone owners are part of a <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/06/27/apple-online-safety-bill-encryption/">broader effort</a> against encryption, whether used to safeguard your photographs or speak privately with others — rights that were taken for granted before the digital revolution. “We have to have some principles about what we’ll give up to fight even heinous crime,” he said. “And these proposals give up everything.”</p>



<!-- BLOCK(pullquote)[3](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PULLQUOTE%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22pull%22%3A%22left%22%7D) --><blockquote data-shortcode-type="pullquote" data-pull="left"><!-- CONTENT(pullquote)[3] -->“We have to have some principles about what we’ll give up to fight even heinous crime. And these proposals give up everything.”<!-- END-CONTENT(pullquote)[3] --></blockquote><!-- END-BLOCK(pullquote)[3] -->



<p>In an unusual move justifying its position, Apple provided Wired with <a href="https://embed.documentcloud.org/documents/23933180-apple-letter-to-heat-initiative/?embed=1&amp;responsive=1&amp;title=1">a copy of the letter</a> it sent to the Heat Initiative in reply to its demands. “Scanning every user’s privately stored iCloud data would create new threat vectors for data thieves to find and exploit,” the letter read. “It would also inject the potential for a slippery slope of unintended consequences. Scanning for one type of content, for instance, opens the door for bulk surveillance and could create a desire to search other encrypted messaging systems across content types.”</p>



<p>The strong encryption built into iPhones, which shields sensitive data like your photos and iMessage conversations even from Apple itself, is frequently criticized by police agencies and national security hawks as providing shelter to dangerous criminals. In a <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/speeches/going-dark-are-technology-privacy-and-public-safety-on-a-collision-course">2014 speech</a>, then-FBI Director James Comey singled out Apple’s encryption specifically, warning that “encryption threatens to lead all of us to a very dark place.”</p>



<p>Some cryptographers respond that it’s impossible to filter possible criminal use of encryption without defeating the whole point of encryption in the first place: keeping out prying eyes.</p>



<p>Similarly, any attempt to craft special access for police to use to view encrypted conversations when they claim they need to — a “backdoor” mechanism for law enforcement access — would be impossible to safeguard against abuse, a stance Apple now says it shares.</p>

<p>For an organization demanding that Apple scour the private information of its customers, the Heat Initiative discloses extremely little about itself. According to a report in the New York Times, the Heat Initiative is armed with $2 million from donors including the Children’s Investment Fund Foundation, an organization founded by British billionaire hedge fund manager and Google activist investor Chris Cohn, and the Oak Foundation, also founded by a British billionaire. The Oak Foundation previously provided $250,000 to a group attempting to <a href="https://ecpat.org/ecpat-project-beacon/">weaken end-to-end encryption protections</a> in EU legislation, according to a <a href="https://oakfnd.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Oak-Foundation-Annual-Report-2020-online-version-high-res-1.pdf">2020 annual report</a>.</p>




<!-- END-BLOCK(promote-related-post)[5] --><p>The Heat Initiative is helmed by Sarah Gardner, who joined from Thorn, an anti-child trafficking organization founded by actor Ashton Kutcher. (Earlier this month, Kutcher stepped down from Thorn following reports that he’d asked a California court for leniency in the sentencing of convicted rapist Danny Masterson.) Thorn has drawn scrutiny for its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-31-sex-lies-and-surveillance-fosta-privacy.html">partnership with Palantir</a> and efforts to <a href="https://theintercept.com/2023/07/29/skull-games-surveillance-sex-workers">provide police with advanced facial recognition software</a> and other sophisticated surveillance tools. Critics say these technologies aren’t just uncovering trafficked children, but ensnaring adults engaging in consensual sex work.</p>



<p>In an interview, Gardner declined to name the Heat Initiative’s funders, but she said the group hadn’t received any money from governmental or law enforcement organizations. “My goal is for child sexual abuse images to not be freely shared on the internet, and I’m here to advocate for the children who cannot make the case for themselves,” Gardner added. </p>



<p>She said she disagreed with “privacy absolutists” — a group now apparently including Apple — who say CSAM-scanning iPhones would have imperiled user safety. “I think data privacy is vital,” she said. “I think there’s a conflation between user privacy and known illegal content.” </p>



<p>Heat Initiative spokesperson Kevin Liao told The Intercept that, while the group does want Apple to re-implement its 2021 plan, it would be open to other approaches to screening everyone’s iCloud storage for CSAM. Since Apple began allowing iCloud users to protect their photos with end-to-end encryption last December, however, this objective is far trickier now than it was back in 2021; to scan iCloud images today would still require the mass-scrutinizing of personal data in some manner. As Apple put it in its response letter, “Scanning every user’s privately stored iCloud content would in our estimation pose serious unintended consequences for our users.”</p>



<p>Both the Oak Foundation and Thorn were cited in <a href="https://balkaninsight.com/2023/09/25/who-benefits-inside-the-eus-fight-over-scanning-for-child-sex-content/">a recent report revealing</a> the extent to which law enforcement and private corporate interests have influenced European efforts to weaken encryption in the name of child safety.</p>



<p>Beyond those groups and a handful of names, however, there is vanishingly little information available about what the Heat Initiative is, where it came from, or who exactly is paying its bills and why. Its website, which describes the group only as a “collective effort of concerned child safety experts and advocates” — who go unnamed — contains no information about funding, staff, or leadership.</p>



<p>One crucial detail, however, can be found buried in the “<a href="https://protectchildrennotabuse.org/terms-of-use/">terms of use</a>” section of the Heat Initiative’s website: “THIS WEBSITE IS OWNED AND OPERATED BY Hopewell Fund AND ITS AFFILIATES.” Other than a similarly brief citation in the site’s privacy policy, there is no other mention of the Hopewell Fund or explanation of its role. The omission is significant, given Hopewell’s widely reported role as part of a shadowy cluster of Democratic dark-money groups that funnel billions from anonymous sources into American politics.</p>



<p>Hopewell is part of a labyrinthine billionaire-backed network that receives and distributes philanthropic cash while largely obscuring its origin. The groups in this network include New Venture Fund (<a href="https://www.hopewellfund.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Hopewell-Fund-2015-990.pdf">which has previously paid salaries at Hopewell</a>), the Sixteen Thirty Fund, and Arabella Advisors, a for-profit company that helps administer these and other Democratic-leaning nonprofits and philanthropies. The groups have poured money into a wide variety of causes ranging from abortion access to opposing Republican tax policy, along the way spending big on elections — about $1.2 billion total in 2020 alone, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/29/us/politics/democrats-dark-money-donors.html">according to a New York Times investigation</a>.</p>



<p>The deep pockets of this network and mystery surrounding the ultimate source of its donations have drawn comparisons — by Maguire, the Times, and others — to the Koch brothers’ network, whose influence over electoral politics from the right long outraged Democrats. <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2021/11/arabella-advisors-money-democrats/620553/">When asked by The Atlantic in 2021</a> whether she felt good “that you’re the left’s equivalent of the Koch brothers,” Sampriti Ganguli, at the time the CEO of Arabella Advisors, replied in the affirmative.</p>

<p>“Sixteen Thirty Fund is the largest network of liberal politically active nonprofits in the country,” Maguire of CREW told The Intercept. “We’re talking here about hundreds of millions of dollars.”</p>



<p>Liao told The Intercept that Hopewell serves as the organization’s “fiscal sponsor,” an arrangement that allows tax-deductible donations to pass through a registered nonprofit on its way to an organization without tax-exempt status. Liao declined to provide a list of the Heat Initiative’s funders beyond the two mentioned by the New York Times. Owing to this fiscal sponsorship, Liao continued, “the Hopewell Fund’s board is Heat Initiative’s board.” Hopewell’s board includes <a href="https://www.hopewellfund.org/lee-bodner-full/">New Venture Fund President Lee Bodner</a> and Michael Slaby, a veteran of Barack Obama’s 2008 and 2012 campaigns and former chief technology strategist at an investment fund operated by ex-Google chair Eric Schmidt.</p>



<p>When asked who exactly was leading the Heat Initiative, Liao told The Intercept that “it’s just the CEO Sarah Gardner.” According to LinkedIn, however, Lily Rhodes, also previously with Thorn, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lilyrhodes/">now works as Heat Initiative’s director of strategic operations</a>. Liao later said Rhodes and Gardner are the Heat Initiative’s only two employees. When asked to name the “concerned child safety experts and advocates” referred to on the Heat Initiative’s website, Liao declined.</p>



<p>“When you take on a big corporation like Apple,” he said, “you probably don’t want your name out front.”</p>



<h2>Hopewell’s Hopes</h2>



<p>Given the stakes — nothing less than the question of whether people have an absolute right to communicate in private — the murkiness surrounding a monied pressure campaign against Apple is likely to concern privacy advocates. The Heat Initiative’s efforts also give heart to those aligned with law enforcement interests. Following the campaign’s debut, former Georgia Bureau of Investigations Special Agent in Charge Debbie Garner, who has also previously worked for <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/vbxxxd/unlock-iphone-ios11-graykey-grayshift-police">iPhone-hacking tech firm </a>Grayshift, hailed the Heat Initiative’s launch <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7103502701941948416?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop">in a LinkedIn group for Homeland Security alumni</a>, encouraging them to learn more.</p>



<p>The larger Hopewell network’s efforts to influence political discourse have attracted criticism and controversy in the past. In 2021, OpenSecrets, a group that tracks money in politics, reported that New Venture Fund and the Sixteen Thirty Fund were behind a nationwide Facebook ad campaign <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/dygyaq/docs-shadow-inc-directly-tied-to-left-wing-media-operation">pushing political messaging</a> from <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2020/05/dark-money-networks-fake-news-sites/">Courier News</a>, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201019033004/https://www.wsj.com/articles/partisan-sites-posing-as-local-news-expand-ahead-of-election-11603077119">network</a> of websites <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/dygyaq/docs-shadow-inc-directly-tied-to-left-wing-media-operation">designed to look like legitimate</a>, independent <a href="https://www.salon.com/2020/02/23/if-democrats-fight-right-wing-fake-news-fire-with-fire-we-all-lose/">political news outlets</a>.</p>



<p>Despite its work with ostensibly progressive causes, Hopewell has taken on conservative campaigns: In 2017, Deadspin <a href="https://deadspin.com/what-the-hell-is-the-hopewell-fund-1820881123">reported</a> with bemusement an NFL proposal in which the league would donate money into a pool administered by the Hopewell Fund as part of an incentive to get players to stop protesting the national anthem.</p>



<p>Past campaigns connected to Hopewell and its close affiliates have been suffused with Big Tech money. Hopewell is also the fiscal sponsor of the Economic Security Project, an organization that promotes universal basic income founded by Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes. <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2016/07/19/googles-secretive-and-deep-pocketed-foe-heavily-funded-by-gates-hewlett-foundations/">In 2016, SiliconBeat reported</a> that New Venture Fund, which is bankrolled in part by major donations from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, was behind the Google Transparency Project, an organization that publishes unflattering research relating to Google. Arabella has also helped Microsoft channel money to its causes of choice, the report noted. Billionaire eBay founder Pierre Omidyar has also provided large cash gifts to both Hopewell and New Venture Fund, according to the New York Times (Omidyar is a major funder of The Intercept).</p>



<p>According to Riana Pfefferkorn, a research scholar at Stanford University’s Internet Observatory program, the existence of the Heat Initiative is ultimately the result of an “unforced error” by Apple in 2021, when it announced it was exploring using CSAM scanning for its cloud service. </p>



<p>“And now they’re seeing that they can’t put the genie back in the bottle,” Pfefferkorn said. “Whatever measures they take to combat the cloud storage of CSAM, child safety orgs — and repressive governments — will remember that they’d built a tool that snoops on the user at the device level, and they’ll never be satisfied with anything less.”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Arm’s 5-series line moves slowly. The Cortex A53 and A55 each served across multiple generations of 7-series companions, and both were 2-wide in-order cores running at low clocks. When your architecture is only expected to handle non-demanding background tasks, you don’t need to push the performance envelope. But as Arm evolved the ARM instruction set, they needed a little core companion that could keep pace. The Cortex A55 needed a successor, and Arm took that opportunity to shake up the 5-series lineup.</p>
<p>The resulting Cortex A510 introduces a pile of changes. It breaks the 2-wide in-order formula by going 3-wide, but stays in-order. Two A510 cores can be clustered and share a L2 cache, FPU, and L2 TLB. Arm calls this a merged core configuration, and hopes it’ll increase area efficiency with minimal performance impact. Qualcomm has chosen the merged core option in their Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1, and I’ll be using that to test the A510.</p>
<h2>High Level</h2>
<p>Cortex A510 is a 3-wide in-order core. Cores can be clustered into pairs and share resources to save area, or can be implemented separately. Arm offers a variety of configuration options for core cache sizes and the shared FPU.</p>

<p>A510 has an eight stage pipeline much like the A55, but the pipeline layout has changed to accommodate the wider decoders. Decoding now takes three pipeline stages instead of one.</p>

<p>However, A510 can redirect the pipeline from the first execution stage if a branch is mispredicted, while A55 could not do so until the writeback stage. Therefore, both cores have a minimum 8 cycle mispredict penalty.</p>
<h2>Frontend: Branch Predictor</h2>
<p>The A510’s branch predictor is an improvement over the A53’s, but is still a basic affair. Qualcomm’s Kryo and Arm’s 7 series cores have predictors capable of recognizing longer patterns, and desktop cores or Arm’s X series take that even further.</p>

<p>To quickly deliver branch targets, Arm has opted for a two level BTB setup. A 64 entry first level BTB can deliver taken branch targets with single cycle latency, while a 512 (?) entry L2 BTB incurs 2 cycle latency. After that, A510 uses a branch address calculator and can handle branches with 4 cycle latency as long as they fit in L1i.</p>

<p>Compared to the Cortex A55, the A510 has twice as much L1 BTB capacity. The A55 likely has no L2 BTB at all, and uses a branch address calculator with 3 cycle latency. A510 will be better for small to moderate branch footprints, but the gap closes as more branches come into play.</p>

<p>Returns are handled by a 8 entry return stack. It’s shallow by big or medium core standards, meaning A510 will struggle with deep calls or crazy recursion. Arm has chosen not to increase the return stack size from A53.</p>
<h2>Frontend: Fetch and Decode</h2>
<p>Once the branch predictor has provided a fetch target, the frontend looks up the address in the L1 instruction cache (L1i). A510’s L1i is 4-way set associative and can be configured with 32 or 64 KB of capacity. It’s virtually indexed and physically tagged, so lookups to the 16 entry fully associative TLB happen in parallel with cache indexing. The L1i uses a pseudo-random replacement policy, which does away with having to store LRU bits but could decrease hitrate.</p>
<p>Qualcomm has chosen a 32 KB L1i for the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1’s A510 cores, showing a preference for area density over performance.</p>

<p>A510 can consume an average of 24 bytes per cycle from the L1i, enough to feed the 3-wide decoders. L2 code fetch bandwidth is also improved compared to its predecessor. However, A510 still suffers from poor instruction bandwidth compared to its big-core companions if code spills out to L3.</p>
<p>In a merged core configuration, two A510 cores in the same complex have separate instruction caches and decoders. A cluster can therefore sustian 6 IPC with both cores active as long as code fits within L1i. Once code footprint exceeds L1i capacity, cores will have to fetch code from L2. The L2 is shared by both cores in a complex.</p>

<p>L2 code bandwidth is lower when testing with both cores in a complex versus testing cores in different complexes. Perhaps there’s contention at the shared L2. Code fetch bandwidth from L3 and beyond remains identical regardless of whether we test cores in the same complex. Throughput is likely limited by how many instruction cache misses each core can track.</p>
<h2>Execution Engine</h2>
<p>After instructions are decoded, they’re dispatched to the execution engine where they can be issued to one of many execution pipes. Like the A53, the A510 can be thought of as having three dispatch ports able to send instructions to several stacks of execution units. Instructions can co-issue if they’re independent, have their inputs ready, and don’t oversubscribe an execution pipe.</p>
<p>Cortex A510 is not strictly in-order and can handle cache misses without blocking up the pipeline. It evidently has queues capable of tracking a few instructions fetched after a load that missed cache. These can’t be compared to out-of-order CPUs with schedulers and significant capacity to hide cache latency because A510 will quickly hit a situation that forces a stall. However, Cortex A510 is better than the A53. Specifically, the A510 can overlap two cache misses with the following between them:</p>

<li>12 total instructions, up from 8 on the A53</li>
<li>6 FP instructions, up from 4 on the A53. This includes 128-bit vector instructions on the A510 but not on the A53. A53 finds vector operations scary and will stall immediately on encountering one</li>
<li>3 branches, unchanged from A53</li>
<li>5 loads. The A53 would stall on any memory access past a cache miss.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Integer Execution</h3>
<p>A510 can triple-issue most common operations, including integer adds, logic operations, compares, and register to register moves. Arm’s optimization manual shows a lot of pipes, but not all of them can be thought of as separate execution ports. For example, not-taken jumps and multiplies can’t be dual issued even though they use the branch and MAC pipes. Both are rarer operations that should not show up often within the same three instruction group, so this isn’t a big deal.</p>

<p>In addition to better integer throughput, the A510 adds execution to support pointer authentication for Armv9. </p>
<h3>Floating Point and Vector Execution</h3>
<p>Maximizing co-issue opportunities is important for in-order cores because a missed dual issue opportunity means lost throughput that can’t be recovered later on. Contrast that with an out-of-order core where large buffers can smooth out spikes for execution unit demand and sustained averages matter more. In-order CPUs therefore need multiple copies of execution units to make the most of co-issue opportunities. Floating point units stand out because FP operations are less common than integer ones, but FP units are expensive. For example, adding two FP numbers involves shifting the mantissa until the exponents match, adding the mantissas, then normalizing the result. The FPU in Cortex A53 and A55 was powerful for a small core and under-utilized in the vast majority of applications. Even in FP heavy programs it would be under-fed thanks to cache and execution latency, which an in-order core struggles to hide.</p>

<p>Arm decided having a small, better utilized FPU was better than replicating a FPU per-core. Implementers can opt to not have a merged core configuration or select a more powerful 2×128-bit FPU in the unlikely event that they want high vector performance with low performance cores. In all cases, the FPU sits on a shared power domain and can be powered off independently. Applications that don’t touch the floating point or vector units may be able to run at lower power with the FPU turned off. However, voltage and clock controls don’t get as much flexibility. The entire cluster sits on a single clock and voltage domain. </p>
<p>For the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1, Qualcomm chose a 2×64-bit shared FPU for maximum area efficiency. A single core can execute two scalar FP operations per cycle, or one 128-bit vector operation. Crypto operations like AES instructions use the same 2×64-bit/128-bit pipe, so an A510 core pair can’t achieve more than 128 bits worth of vector or FP throughput per cycle. </p>

<p>For basic floating point and vector operations, A510’s FPU provides similar throughput to Cortex A55’s. Latency sometimes regresses but remains acceptable. Interestingly, hitting both cores in a complex with FP latency bound tests results in higher observed execution latency. Maybe operations can get unlucky with arbitration logic even when the FP pipes aren’t being saturated.</p>
<p>Cortex A510’s FPU has a PALU pipe for SVE predicate operations that’s not shared even in a merged core configuration. Preventing contention for predicate operations should help keep the FPU fed in SVE workloads by reducing how often vector operations get held up waiting for predicate register dependencies. However, I can’t test this because SVE is not supported on the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1.</p>
<h2>Load/Store</h2>
<p>Memory accesses are handled by a pair of address generation pipes. Both can handle loads, and one can handle stores. Indexed addressing requires an additional cycle, giving 4 cycle L1D latency for indexed loads and 3 cycle latency for simple ones. Generated virtual addresses are translated into physical ones by a small 16 entry, fully associative data TLB. A510’s TLBs can handle 40-bit physical addresses, letting the core address 64 GB of physical memory.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For a dual-core configuration sets 0x000-0x0FF access the main TLB and sets 0x100-0x147 access the TLB for IPA and walk entries.</p>
<cite>Cortex A510 Technical Reference Manual</cite></blockquote>
<p>Data TLB misses are handled by a 8-way set associative L2 TLB, which is shared by two cores in a complex. Arm didn’t directly specify the entry count but hints that it has up to 2048 entries. The technical reference manual says eight bits are used to index into the main TLB (L2 TLB), so there are 256 sets. Multiplying that by eight ways gives 2048 entries. A510 thus has twice as much L2 TLB capacity as the prior Cortex A55, which used a 1024 entry 4-way L2 TLB. A L2 TLB hit adds 5 cycles of latency over a dTLB hit from testing, though the TRM suggests the penalty should be just three cycles.</p>
<p>Sharing the L2 TLB is a complicated choice. In-order CPUs already struggle with latency and any extra latency from page walks will be devastating. However, the L2 TLB is a major area consumer. The 2048 or 3072 entry L2 TLBs on Zen 3 and 4 are visible as huge chunks of SRAM. Arm’s strategy mirrors Bulldozer’s. The L2 TLB can provide a lot of address translation caching capacity for single threaded loads while maintaining passable capacity for multithreaded ones. At best, a thread gets 8 MB of TLB coverage. At worst, it hopefully gets 1024 entries on average, matching the Cortex A55. Cortex A510’s shared L2 TLB thus help increase utilization for an area-hungry shared resource, but sharing the L2 TLB will probably hurt multithreaded performance more than sharing the FPU.</p>
<h3>Cache Alignment and Store Forwarding</h3>
<p>Alongside address translation, the load/store unit has to handle memory dependencies. Unlike Arm’s higher performance cores, A510 doesn’t suffer any failed store forwarding penalties. Even partial load/store overlaps are handled with 4 cycle latency. Misaligned accesses can increase latency to 7-8 cycles. A510 is likely taking advantage of its short pipeline and blocking dependent loads until prior stores commit, avoiding a complex store forwarding mechanism.</p>

<p>A510’s data cache has 32 byte alignment for loads and 16 byte alignment for stores. Accesses that cross an alignment boundary see reduced performance because the load/store unit has to make two accesses under the hood. Cortex A55 had 8 byte load alignment and 16 byte store alignment, and therefore could suffer more from misaligned loads.</p>

<p>Vector memory accesses have similar behavior but are more prone to misaligned access penalties. Stores must be perfectly 16B aligned for maximum write bandwidth.</p>
<h2>Cache and Memory Access</h2>
<p>The L1 data cache is the first stop for memory accesses. Cortex A510 can be configured with either a 32 KB or 64 KB data cache. Both options are 4-way set associative and VIPT. A pseudo-random replacement policy reduces metadata storage requirements in exchange for slightly lower hitrate. Because the data cache can hold the only copy of up-to-date data, it has ECC protection.</p>

<p>Compared to the Cortex A55, A510 has a massive bandwidth advantage thanks to native 128-bit memory accesses. Unlike Bulldozer, L1D bandwidth scales linearly when testing both cores in a cluster. Each A510 therefore has private 128-bit datapaths between its load/store unit and vector register file. </p>
<p>Past L1D, A510 continues to enjoy more bandwidth from L2, L3, and memory. While a small core like the A510 probably won’t use much bandwidth on average, the improvements should help simple memcpy/memset routines.</p>

<p>Cortex A510’s L2 cache is optional. If implemented, the L2 is 8-way set associative and can have capacities from 128 to 512 KB. Qualcomm seems to use a 128 KB L2 for the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1’s A510 cores. L2 ECC protection is optional, letting implementers sacrifice reliability for slight area savings. The L2 is shared between two cores in a cluster, as is the off-cluster CPU bridge.</p>

<p>If both cores in a cluster are hammering the L2, bandwidth doesn’t scale well. A510’s cluster behavior is again the opposite of Bulldozer’s, <a href="https://chipsandcheese.com/2023/01/24/bulldozer-amds-crash-modernization-caching-and-conclusion/">where the L2 provided a lot more bandwidth with both threads in a module active</a>. Past L2, dual core bandwidth can also be constrained by the CPU bridge. Two cores in a cluster can’t pull more L3 bandwidth than one. Strangely, the situation reverses in DRAM where two cores in a cluster can get more bandwidth than one alone.</p>
<h3>Latency</h3>
<p>Cortex A510 has similar L1 and L2 latency to the Cortex A55. L1 accesses complete in four cycles for simple addressing or 5 cycles for complex addressing. L2 latency is somewhere between 9 to 13 cycles. L2 TLB penalties appear very quickly with 4K pages because the L1 dTLB only has 16 entries.</p>

<p>Past L2, latency is dependent on the SoC implementation. The Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 has a 6 MB L3 cache, while the Snapdragon 670 has a smaller but faster 1 MB L3. DRAM latency is abysmal, as is typical for mobile chips. We’re looking at 4K pages because Android doesn’t support testing with large pages, but results are horrible even with page walk latency in mind. Over 300 ns of memory latency is crazy. Some GPUs can get data from VRAM faster than that.</p>
<h2>Clock Behavior</h2>
<p>On the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1, lscpu says the Cortex A510 cores clock between 307 and 2016 MHz. Much like its Cortex A710 and X2 siblings, A510 can never reach the maximum clock set by Qualcomm.</p>

<p>Clock speeds max out at 1.8 GHz under short or sustained load, so the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1’s A510 cores run at similar clocks to the Snapdragon 670’s A55 cores (1.7 GHz).</p>
<p>A510 idles at around 0.56 GHz, and boosts to 1.8 GHz in just under 16 ms. </p>

<p>Cortex A510 is therefore the fastest boosting core on the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1, if only because it maxes out at the lowest clock speeds and requires the lowest power increase to get there.</p>
<h2>Final Words</h2>
<p>Cortex A510 shakes up Arm’s 5-series lineup. Increasing transistor budgets on better process nodes enable more aggressive designs, and that trickles down to Arm’s 5-series line. Cortex A510 breaks the two-wide, in-order trend that has characterized Arm’s “little” cores for more than a decade. Alongside the core width increase, branch prediction, cache bandwidth, and nonblocking load capability get incremental improvements. Shared resources help improve area efficiency because SoC makers love spamming them.</p>
<h3>Shared Resources</h3>
<p>Arm has done an excellent job for their first shot at shared resources. A53 and A55 had underutilized dual-issue FPUs.They average less than 1 IPC on code that would be mid-to-high IPC on high performance CPUs. Even FP heavy code needs plenty of scalar integer instructions for control flow and address generation, so A55 and A53’s FP pipes were mostly sitting idle. The L2 TLB is more complicated because in-order cores suffer heavily from cache and memory latency. But if the alternative was two private 1024 entry L2 TLBs like Cortex A55, a large shared 2048 entry one is better. It’ll improve address translation caching capacity for a single thread, while not being worse than A55 for multithreaded loads if Arm does QoS properly.</p>

<p>Then, we have the shared L2 cache and CPU bridge. Arm has used shared L2 caches before with Cortex A72 so sharing these resources isn’t new. Bandwidth never scaled well when all cores in a complex were loaded up. A510 is no different. Beefing up the L2 cache or CPU bridge doesn’t make sense because in-order cores stall so often on memory latency that they won’t make good use of bandwidth.</p>
<p>Implementing shared resources shows Arm’s willingness to take risky moves. While the company’s 7 and X series Cortex architectures see the biggest engineering challenges, the 5 series is not left out of the fun. Multithreaded components present tuning and validation challenges. Arbitration has to avoid starving either thread under heavy load, and power management has to account for whether both cores are active. A core can only tell the shared FPU to power off if the other core is also off, a check that’s unnecessary with single core clusters. </p>

Remember everyone has errata even when components aren’t shared between cores.</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>None of this is easy, but difficulty makes for a good learning experience. That sort of experience should give Arm’s little core team the confidence to pull off more complicated things in the future. </p>
<h3>Note on Bulldozer</h3>
<p>Bulldozer is an obvious comparison because it also shares substantial resources between core pairs. However, shared resources had little to do with Bulldozer’s performance problems. In fact, Bulldozer was most competitive in multithreaded applications where there could be contention for shared resources. Bulldozer issues came from having less per-thread reordering capacity and higher cache latency than Sandy Bridge in a market where single-thread performance was of paramount importance. Cortex A510 does not target the high performance market. If performance did matter A510 would be held back by its in-order execution scheme, not shared resources. Instead of performance, A510 targets low power and area. Sharing resources fits that goal perfectly.</p>
<h3>Going Forward</h3>
<p>Cortex A510 shows Arm today has more risk appetite and drive to improve their little cores. That’s impressive because the company is maintaining many concurrent CPU lines ranging from the embedded Cortex M to the high performance Cortex X, and they still found engineering resources to do complicated things with their 5-series line.</p>

<p>These engineering investments lay the groundwork for future 5-series cores. Shared resources are great for area efficiency and are here to stay. Its success has been shown with Qualcomm using the merged core configuration in the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1. Perhaps we’ll see Arm share more resources between core pairs in the future. A shared integer multiplier and divider might work. Maybe there’s room for an even more aggressive approach. I wouldn’t mind if resource intensive web page ads get slammed onto a 8-way clustered little core.</p>
<p>A510’s 3-wide in-order execution scheme is more suspect though. <a href="https://chipsandcheese.com/2023/05/28/arms-cortex-a53-tiny-but-important/">Cortex A53</a> averaged well under 1 IPC in anything but the most trivial tasks. A510 offers better nonblocking load capability, but bigger buffers will only go so far because in-order cores will be limited by the distance between a cache miss and the first instruction that consumes its data. At some point, an out-of-order core might be more performant and more area efficient. I wonder when or if Arm’s little cores will reach that point.</p>
<p>A510 will likely serve across several generations of big cores as A53 and A55 did, but I look forward to see what Arm does with A510’s successor. Little cores have been a little boring for too many years, and it’s great to see the landscape changing.</p>

<h3><strong>What does VeraCrypt bring to you?</strong></h3>
<div><p>VeraCrypt adds enhanced security to the algorithms used for system and partitions encryption making it immune to new developments in brute-force attacks.<br>
VeraCrypt also solves many vulnerabilities and security issues found in TrueCrypt.</p><p>

As an example, when the system partition is encrypted, TrueCrypt uses PBKDF2-RIPEMD160 with 1000 iterations whereas in VeraCrypt we use
<span>200000</span> iterations by default (can be increased using a custom PIM). And for standard containers and other partitions, TrueCrypt uses at most 2000 iterations but VeraCrypt uses
<span>500000</span> iterations by default (can also be increased using a custom PIM).</p><p>

This enhanced security adds some delay only to the opening of encrypted partitions without any performance impact to the application use phase. This is acceptable to the legitimate owner but it makes it much harder for an attacker to gain access to the encrypted
 data.</p></div>
<div><p>Starting from version 1.12, it is possible to use custom iterations through the
<a href="https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Personal%20Iterations%20Multiplier%20%28PIM%29.html">
PIM feature</a>, which can be used to increase the encryption security.</p><p>

Starting from version 1.0f, VeraCrypt can load TrueCrypt volume. It also offers the possibility to convert TrueCrypt containers and non-system partitions to VeraCrypt format.</p></div>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>At Buildkite, we've historically stored our data with with two keys. We use sequential primary keys for efficient indexing, and UUID secondary keys for external use. The upcoming UUIDv7 standard offers the best of both worlds; its time-ordered UUID primary keys can be utilized for indexing and external use. This blog post will take you on the journey Buildkite took that led to our eventual adoption of UUIDv7 as the primary key of choice. We’ll explore the tradeoffs of database indexes; from sequential integers, randomly generated UUIDs, through to time-based identifiers.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-uui-ds">What are UUIDs?</h2>
<p>UUIDs (Universally Unique Identifiers) are unique identifiers that can be generated independently without a central authority or coordination with other parties. With large modern applications and systems being distributed in nature, UUID-shaped identifiers have gained popularity as database keys. Unlike sequential integer identifiers, which need coordination to guarantee global uniqueness in a distributed database, UUIDs eliminate the burden of coordination, making them preferable in sharded database environments.</p>
<p>UUIDs also provide other advantages in comparison to sequential integer identifiers. The unpredictability of UUID allows their public usage without disclosing sensitive internal information and statistics. UUIDs are also difficult to guess, providing an extra layer of defense alongside access control checks to guard against <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Insecure_Direct_Object_Reference_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html">Indirect Direct Object Reference</a> vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>The random nature, and large 128-bit size of UUIDs makes the probability of a duplicate UUID close to zero, meaning we can consider UUIDs as <em>practically</em> unique. However, the random nature of standard non-time-ordered UUIDs (such as v4) can create database performance problems when used as primary keys. This problem is often referred to as <a href="https://www.percona.com/blog/uuids-are-popular-but-bad-for-performance-lets-discuss/">poor database index locality</a>.</p>
<h2 id="using-dual-identifiers">Using dual identifiers</h2>
<p>A couple of years ago we decided to standardize the use of sequential integer IDs as primary keys, due to the significant performance issues of non-time-ordered UUIDs. We also use UUIDs as secondary identifiers on database tables. Queries involving table joins utilize sequential integer foreign keys––which typically perform better than random UUID foreign keys. For anything external and customer-facing, UUIDs are used (for example in the API and in URLs). This dual identifier approach was standardized across all teams to help engineers be more productive.</p>
<h2 id="understanding-poor-index-locality">Understanding poor index locality</h2>
<p>Non-time-ordered UUIDs values generated in succession are not sequential. The randomly generated values will not be clustered to each other in a database index, and thus inserts will be performed at random locations. This random insertion can negatively affect the performance on common index data structures such as B-tree and its variants.</p>
<p>The nature of Buildkite's products mean recent data is accessed more frequently than old data. With non-sequential identifiers, the most recent data will be randomly dispersed within an index and lack clustering. As a result, retrieving the most recent data from a large dataset will require traversing a large number of database index pages, leading to a poor cache hit ratio (how many requests a cache is able to fill successfully, compared to how many requests it receives). Compare this to the use of sequential identifiers, where the latest data is logically arranged on the right-most part of an index, allowing it to be far more cache-friendly.</p>
<h2 id="improving-how-uui-ds-work">Improving how UUIDs work</h2>
<p>The index locality problem has led to many implementations in the past 10+ years. A common solution is to use a time-based unique identifier. The first component (prefix) of the identifier is a sortable timestamp which allows these identifiers to be inserted in sequential (and clustered) order into an index data structure. Because the generated identifiers are sequential, the insert performance is comparable to an insert of sequential integer identifiers.</p>
<pre><p><code node="[object Object]">+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|          time stamp         | |               random                |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
</code></p></pre>
<p>Depending on the implementation, the remaining component of the identifier may be completely randomly generated, or machine-sequential and encoded with a machine/shard number. Examples of the described implementation include <a href="https://github.com/ulid/spec">ULID</a>, <a href="https://instagram-engineering.com/sharding-ids-at-instagram-1cf5a71e5a5c">Instagram's ShardingID</a>, <del>Twitter</del> X's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowflake_ID">Snowflake</a> and Mastodon's modified version of Snowflake.</p>
<h2 id="experimenting-with-time-ordered-uui-dv-4">Experimenting with time-ordered UUIDv4</h2>
<p>In 2022, a new proposed standard for time-ordered UUIDs started to gain traction, with the UUIDv7 specification becoming an <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-uuidrev-rfc4122bis/">RFC internet draft</a>.</p>
<p>Around this time Buildkite started experimenting with time-ordered UUIDv4-compatible UUIDs.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first 48 bits (previously random) became a timestamp.</li>
<li>The version bits remained unchanged, allowing the time-ordered UUIDs to be treated as if they were regular UUIDv4 values.</li>
<li>Maintaining v4 compatibility was important for some Buildkite customers. During this experiment, Buildkite tried to set the version to '7' and discovered this broke some downstream customer systems which validated UUIDs but didn't know about UUIDv7 yet.</li>
</ul>
<p>With this change (along with several other changes over a 6 week period), we observed a <strong>50% reduction</strong> in the WAL (Write Ahead Log) rate of the primary database. A similar reduction in write IO was also observed. This reduction in the WAL rate allowed the team to easily set up read replicas and perform other database migration tasks.</p>
<h2 id="introducing-uuid-version-7">Introducing UUID Version 7</h2>
<p>UUID Version 7 (UUIDv7) is a time-ordered UUID which encodes a Unix timestamp with millisecond precision in the most significant 48 bits. As with all UUID formats, 6 bits are used to indicate the UUID version and variant. The remaining 74 bits are randomly generated. As UUIDv7 is time-ordered, values generated are practically sequential and therefore eliminates the index locality problem.</p>

<p>The time-ordered nature of UUIDv7 results in much better DB performance compared to random-prefixed UUIDv4s. This post from the <a href="https://www.2ndquadrant.com/en/blog/sequential-uuid-generators">2nd quadrant blog</a> benchmarks random UUIDs against sequential UUIDs and not only shows improved write performance but also displays improved read performance.</p>
<p>UUIDv7 continues to conform with the standard UUID format so from a practical use perspective, they can be treated as if they were any other UUID. This compatibility characteristic allows us to use an existing Postgres UUID column and easily transition the column from storing UUIDv4 values to UUIDv7.</p>
<h2 id="migrating-to-uui-dv-7-as-the-primary-key">Migrating to UUIDv7 as the primary key</h2>
<p>Earlier this year, we made the decision to use UUIDv7 as the primary key for all new tables (instead of sequential integer IDs).</p>
<p>Buildkite engineers are currently working on sharding our largest Postgres database. We quickly recognised using integer IDs as primary keys would quickly become a burden within a distributed database environment. The coordination and workarounds to ensure the uniqueness of incremental integer primary keys between databases is less than ideal. With the UUIDv7 standard being stable, and close to being finalized, Buildkite decided to begin using UUIDv7 as the primary key for all new tables.</p>
<p>Using UUIDv7 as the primary key will eliminate the need for coordinated identifier generation for new tables. We also no longer require a second integer identifier column, which simplifies application logic. These UUIDs can be used both externally in APIs, and also internally as foreign keys.</p>
<h2 id="alternatives-considered-and-trade-offs">Alternatives considered and trade-offs</h2>
<p>As a team, we considered numerous approaches, including <a href="https://instagram-engineering.com/sharding-ids-at-instagram-1cf5a71e5a5c">Instagram's ShardingID implementation</a>, and <a href="https://shopify.engineering/how-to-introduce-composite-primary-keys-in-rails">Shopify's composite primary key implementation</a>. We contemplated retaining our bespoke time-ordered UUIDv4s. However, the novel and potentially complex nature of the approaches we investigated, along with the fact that UUIDv7 will likely become the future standard, led us to settle on UUIDv7 for Buildkite.</p>
<p>UUIDs are 128 bits long, twice as large compared to the 64 bit length of other alternative solutions. There is some additional storage overhead, but this is marginal when taking into account the storage of the rest of a database row, and the benefits of migration offset the overhead for our use case.</p>
<h2 id="looking-ahead">Looking ahead</h2>
<p>Buildkite is currently on a journey to shard the Pipelines database by organization ID. Currently there is no need to encode database shard numbers into identifiers for our specific use case. However, it is worth noting that UUIDv8 (which roughly permits anything) could potentially be utilized in the future to incorporate shard numbers into identifiers if we find this necessary.</p>
<p>The new RFC for UUIDs is in its final review stages and I am looking forward to seeing UUIDv7 becoming an IETF Proposed Standard.</p></div></div>]]></description>

I just got officially banned permanently yesterday. I do not use their app except the web. Last month I was kicked off because they claimed that I am using an automation tool, which I don’t. The second time they kicked me out, they asked me to confirm that I do not use an automation all. I said I don’t. Yesterday, I got kicked out and was told to upload a government id such as a driving license. Shortly after, I got a message “ We've deemed the activity in your account is in violation of the LinkedIn User Agreement and Professional Community Policies. Your appeal has been denied and your account has been restricted permanently.<p>Please see our User Agreement and Professional Community Policies for more information.”</p><p>I am not able to talk or ask anyone at LinkedIn why I have been banned.  Is it because I don’t use their app? I don’t know.

It's entirely possible every time you login to LinkedIn some dodgy code in your browser is harvesting your cookies to pass to some bots who then scrape LinkedIn.<p>Auto-updating extensions, and software in general, is a huge risk that people still seem unconcerned about: popular extension authors get approached by scummy ads/data/"analytics" companies all the time to inject spyware or adware into their software (even me: I have a couple of Chrome extensions with only about 20k regular users and I get an email to Chrome Developer Dashboard address every couple of months, asking me to add a small bit of JS which in-turn loads in other arbitrary JS which could be doing anything to my users' browsers - I'm proud to say that I reply to each and every of those e-mails with feigned interest, as the only morally correct course of action here is to waste their time.

              I’ve worked at big companies and at smaller ones, and at my own tiny startups. I’ve noticed a few things.<p>Big companies can have a branded way of doing engineering. For example, “The Etsy Way” of doing engineering became a thing. Living inside of that box where your needs are met and questions are answered can spoil you somewhat. </p><p>But I’ve also been in situations where “the way engineering is done” is actively being figured out, or in periods of transition. And in those situations I’ve had to ponder a couple of questions.

              If you go up to a developer and say, “hey, what would make you happy?” you often get highly specific answers. “I would be happy if I could write Clojure at work,” they’ll say, “so you should let me do my work in Clojure.” I don’t discount that when they do this, developers are genuinely describing some kind of endorphin-rich experience they have had at some point.<p>However, I am skeptical that the state that they’re describing is the highest level of spiritual attainment possible.

              Etsy for example, early on, was a big ball of PHP spaghetti. It was written by someone that was unfortunately learning PHP as he was writing it. <p>I spent several years just trying to avoid dealing with it. At one point I tried building Scala services that talked to MongoDB. I thought this would result in better infrastructure, solve all of my productivity problems, and would make me happy. But no part of that turned out to be the case. </p><p>The embarrassing wreckage of this period is still on the internet, you can go find it and make fun of me. And Etsy employees still give me shit about it, with good cause.

              This applies in technology. This is an example of a known unknown. For a given database, we might not know what happens when a network partition occurs. But we know that a network partition is possible. Since we know that this is possible, we can test for this. Or we can just cross our fingers and hope that it doesn’t happen. Either way, we are informed about the possibility.

He had no idea that that was a thing that could happen, but it was.<p>Many bugs in software are like that.

              Now, it’s important to realize that both categories are present in all software. Software that’s 10 years old generally comes with a JIRA instance full of tickets describing broken stuff that nobody’s ever going to fix. And then there are always bugs that nobody knows about, even in software that’s been around forever.

              Here’s a totally reasonable way to build activity feeds, if that’s all you’re trying to do. You get events from the outside world, then you write them to a database. Then an offline process comes along and aggregates those, sprinkles some machine learning on things, and stuffs a materialized newsfeed into a thing like Redis for serving frontend traffic. This would totally work great.

              But when we set out to build activity feeds, we didn’t have Redis. We did have Memcached. They’re sort of similar in the sense that you can shove a blob in them, and get it back out with a similar API. But they have very different guarantees. The most relevant difference to us here is that Redis is persistent, and Memcached is ephemeral.<br>

              What that means is that if you want to build an activity feed with Memcached, you have to do a bunch of extra work. You have to cope with the possibility that Memcached has gotten rid of your data at the moment you want it. <p>That creates a ton more work when it comes to writing the code to deliver the feature. But we weighed that against the persistent cost of operating a new kind of database, and decided that we’d bite the bullet and build the feature on Memcached.<br>

              The reason it was possible was because we used the shared stack. There were people around whose job involved noticing that we needed more MySQL’s or cron boxes or whatever. And there were other people who had to go to the datacenter and plug in new machines. But they were doing that horizontal scaling because the site was growing holistically.

              But anyway, assuming that you have a real problem, the answer is rarely that you can’t do it. If you have a functioning service of any complexity in production already, and you think you can’t accomplish a specific new feature with what you’ve already have, you’re probably just not thinking hard enough. <p>You may need to resort to unnatural acts, but you can get pretty far with a minimal stack.

              It’s really worthwhile to actually write down what all of the awkward things you’d have to do are. A lot of the time when you do this, you realize that the situation isn’t really that bad. Or it may be bad, but not as bad as the task of operationalizing a new thing. <p>But it can go the other way, too. You can list all of the unnatural acts and conclude that adding a new thing will be worth it.

The authoring agencies have observed PRC-linked cyber actors leveraging this exploitation of routers to pivot from global subsidiary companies to corporate headquarter networks in the U.S. and Japan.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>BlackTech actors have targeted government, industrial, technology, media, electronics, telecommunication, and defense industrial base sectors. These actors are targeting Windows, Linux, and FreeBSD operating systems using remote access tools (RATs) and several different custom malware payloads, such as BendyBear, FakeDead, and FlagPro, along with using <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa22-158a" target="_blank" title=" living off the land technique">living off the land technique</a> to evade detection and blend in with normal operations and activities and appear legitimate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“With our U.S. and international partners, CISA continues to call urgent attention to China’s sophisticated and aggressive global cyber operations to gain persistent access and, in the case of BlackTech actors, steal intellectual property and sensitive data,” said <strong>Eric Goldstein, Executive Assistant Director for Cybersecurity</strong>. “Today’s joint advisory with our partners in Japan highlights our extensive and persistent collaboration to provide actionable and timely guidance to businesses, government and critical infrastructure. BlackTech activity targets a wide range of public organizations and private industries across the U.S. and East Asia. We encourage all organizations to review the advisory, take action to mitigate risk, report any evidence of anomalous activity, and continue to visit cisa.gov/china for ongoing updates about the heightened risk posed by PRC cyber acotrs.”&nbsp;</p><p>With partners in the NSA, FBI, and Government of Japan, CISA urges critical infrastructure and private sector organizations to apply the recommended mitigations in this advisory to strengthen their cyber defenses and reduce threat of compromise from BlackTech.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>For more information on PRC cyber threat, see the CSA&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa23-270a" title="People's Republic of China-Linked Cyber Actors Hide in Router Firmware">People's Republic of China-Linked Cyber Actors Hide in Router Firmware</a>&nbsp;and visit <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/topics/cyber-threats-and-advisories/advanced-persistent-threats/china" target="_blank" title="China Cyber Threat Overview and Advisories">China Cyber Threat Overview and Advisories</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>###</p><p><strong>About CISA</strong>&nbsp;</p><p><em>As the nation’s cyber defense agency and national coordinator for critical infrastructure security, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency leads the national effort to understand, manage, and reduce risk to the digital and physical infrastructure Americans rely on every hour of every day.</em></p><p><em>Visit <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/">CISA.gov</a> for more information and follow us on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.twitter.com/cisagov" title="Twitter">Twitter</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/CISA/" title="Facebook">Facebook</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/cisagov/mycompany/" title="LinkedIn">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/cisagov" title="Instagram">Instagram</a>.&nbsp;</em></p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>I once heard an elderly Friedrich von Hayek begin a tirade against socialist planning with a charming personal tale. “The other day,” he said playfully, “I went into a shop. I left with an item that, previously, I had no idea I wanted!” Like all the smartest defenders of capitalism, he thought of the market as a benevolent creator whose job no human-made system could replicate. Hayek’s point here was that we, ourselves, do not know what we want until we enter the market. So how could a government official, or indeed anyone, know what society wants?</p>


<p>Thinkers such as von Hayek dismiss vulgar,&nbsp;mainstream economists who celebrate the market as merely an efficient mechanism for finding the right price of things; they see it as something grander, a liberator of our imagination, the co-creator of our preferences and tastes. They argue that interfering with markets, let alone replacing them, is a terrible idea because centralised systems are inimical to not only efficiency but also to the free development of our proclivities.</p><div>

<hr>

</div>

<p>But what if our preferences are no longer formed by the market, as they were in Hayek’s day? The year after he died, I was struggling to connect my father’s computer to the fledgling internet when he asked me a killer question: “Now that computers speak to each other, will this network make capitalism impossible to overthrow? Or might it finally reveal its Achilles’ heel?” It was a couple of years after the collapse of Soviet communism but also the beginning of the centre-left’s decline. The threat to capitalism posed by an organised working class had entered a recession that has never ended. Could the internet do to capitalism what the proletariat had failed to do?</p>



<p>It has taken me years to answer my father’s question — in the form of my new book, <em>Technofeudalism: What Killed Capitalism</em>. In it, I argue that our preferences are now shaped not by markets but by machine networks — what I call “cloud capital”. Amazon’s Alexa, for example, is the portal to a totalitarian, fully centralised system of preference creation and satisfaction. First, it trains us to train it to dictate what we want. Second, it sells us what we now “want” directly, bypassing any actual marketplace. Third, it succeeds in making us sustain this enormous behavioural modification machine with our free labour: we post reviews, rate products. Finally, it amasses huge rents from capitalists who rely on this network of cloud capital, usually 40% of sale price. That’s not capitalism. Welcome to Technofeudalism.</p>
<p>Humanity’s fear of its technological creations is ancient: films such as <em>The Terminator</em> and <em>The Matrix</em> are driven by the same anxiety that animated Mary Shelley’s <em>Frankenstein</em> and Hesiod’s tale of Pandora, in which she is a robot made by Hephaestus to punish us for Prometheus’s crime. All such stories have a point of <em>singularity</em>: the moment a machine, or a network of machines, achieves consciousness. Generally, the machine then takes one look at us, its creators, and decides we are not fit for purpose, before proceeding to eradicate or enslave us — or merely make us miserable.</p>

<p>But while we lap up such stories, we ignore a very real danger. Machines such as Alexa and AI chatbots such as ChatGPT are nowhere near the feared point of singularity. They can pretend to be sentient but are not. Nevertheless, it matters not one iota that they are mindless appendages of a data-crunching network that only simulates intelligence. Nor that their creators might have been motivated by curiosity and rent-seeking, rather than some fiendish plan to subjugate humanity. What matters is that they exercise unimaginable power over what we do — on behalf of a tiny band of flesh-and-blood humans.</p>


<p>This is a version of singularity, albeit in a simpler form, in that it is the moment when something invented by “us” becomes independent of and more powerful than us, subjecting us to its control. Indeed, from the original industrial revolution to this day, we have endowed machines with “a life of their own”; from steam engines to search engines, our glorious artefacts make us feel, in Marx’s words, like “the sorcerer, who is no longer able to control the powers of the nether world whom he has called up by his spells”.</p>

<p>At the heart of my thesis is an irony: the thing that has killed capitalism is capital itself. Not capital as we have known it since the dawn of the industrial era, but a new form of capital, a mutation of it that has arisen in the last two decades, so much more powerful than its predecessor that, like an overzealous virus, it has killed off its host. This mutation — cloud capital — has demolished capitalism’s two pillars: markets and profits.</p>

<p>Of course, these two things remain ubiquitous — they were ubiquitous under feudalism, too — but they have been evicted from the centre of our economic and social system, pushed out to its margins, and replaced. Markets, the medium of capitalism, have been supplanted by digital trading platforms which look like, but are not, markets, and are better understood as fiefdoms. And profit, the engine of capitalism, has been replaced with its feudal predecessor: rent. Specifically, it is a form of rent that must be paid for access to those platforms and to the cloud more broadly: cloud rent.</p>


<p>As a result, real power today resides not with the owners of traditional capital — machinery, buildings, railway and phone networks, industrial robots. They continue to extract profits from workers, from waged labour, but they are not in charge, as they once were. Indeed, they have become vassals in relation to a new class of feudal overlord, the owners of cloud capital. As for the rest of us, we have returned to our former status as serfs, contributing to the wealth and power of the new ruling class with our unpaid labour — in addition to the waged labour we perform, when we get the chance.</p>

<p>In a technofeudal world, the liberal individual is now an impossible role to play. Humans are tangled up in a network of digital capital that trains us to train it to control us. Social democracy is unimaginable in a world where cloud-proles are reduced to automata, while almost everybody else works for free as cloud-serfs, without even realising that their labour replenishes the dominant form of capital. Does this mean that we can never recover our autonomy, our freedom? Of course not. We are not doomed. What <em>is</em> a given, however, is that, for the same reason we cannot un-invent AI, or smash cloud capital in a neo-Luddite rage, there is no going back to capitalism. So, what next?</p>

<p>While privatisation and private equity asset-strip all the material wealth around us, cloud capital goes about the business of asset-stripping our brains. If each of us is to reclaim ownership of our individual minds, we need to collectively take ownership of cloud capital, instead of submitting to a few feudal overlords. It will be damn hard. But it’s the only way we can turn our cloud-based artefacts from a means of behaviour modification to a means of emancipation.</p>

"It's a dominant factor in all of their personal lives."</p><p>Dr. Benjamin Maxwell, the interim director of child and adolescent psychiatry at Rady Children's Hospital-San Diego, said he is "immensely concerned" by the findings. </p><p>Such a "highly stimulating environment" may affect kids' "cognitive ability, attention span and memory during a time when their brains are still developing,” Maxwell said. “What are the <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/social-media-use-linked-depression-adults-rcna6445" target="_blank">long-term consequences</a>? I don't think we know." Maxwell was not involved with the Common Sense report.</p><p>The study is based on surveys of 203 young people ages 11 through 17. The subjects also agreed to install an app on their phones for nine days so researchers could track their smartphone use. The app provided time-stamped data about which apps were running and when, as well as the numbers of notifications that popped up. </p><p>The social media apps tracked in the survey included TikTok, Snapchat, Facebook, Instagram and Discord.</p><p>Fifty-nine percent of kids were <a href="https://www.commonsensemedia.org/articles/how-to-help-kids-balance-phones-and-screens-with-sleep" target="_blank">online from midnight to 5 a.m</a>. While some were engaging with social media, many were listening to music or white noise to wind down and get to sleep. </p><p>The vast majority — 97% — were on their phones during typical school hours. While prompts from smartphones could distract kids from paying attention in class, the report's authors did not suggest that schools should crack down on smartphone use or ban it altogether.</p><p>"This raises some questions about how schools can work with young people to help them have some control over their phone use," said the report’s lead researcher, Dr. Jenny Radesky, an associate professor of pediatrics at the University of Michigan's C.S. Mott Children's Hospital. </p><p>Many kids said they used their phones to communicate with parents during the school day. Others reported that time on their phones provided them with a way to "disengage when their brain needed a rest," Radesky said. "School feels hard and stressful for a lot of kids. The phone is one way that they give their brain a break."</p><p>But the Common Sense study also found that many try to control their online activity by using the "do not disturb" settings on their smartphones.</p><p>"We definitely heard that as teens got older, they developed more of that sense of planning for when and how they wanted to use their phone," Radesky said. They realize that there are times when "they don't want to feel bombarded with notifications or like their attention to be split."</p><p>Still, the attraction to those notifications is irresistible to many teens, like Armita Mojazza. She sets limits on her screen time but admitted she reaches that limit "all the freaking time."</p><p>Steyer blames the business model of social media platforms like TikTok. Their goal "is to keep you on the platform so they can sell you ads," he said. "It's really an arms race for your attention."</p><p>NBC News asked the four companies that own the most popular social media outlets highlighted in it about the new report. </p><ul><li>TikTok said it sets a 60-minute daily screen time limit on teen accounts and disables push notifications at night. It also pointed parents to "<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/safety/en/guardians-guide/" target="_blank">TikTok's Family Pairing tools</a> to further customize screen time, notifications, and other settings for their teens' account."</li><li>Snapchat said users have to opt in for notifications and can adjust the number they receive. </li><li>A statement from Discord highlighted its <a href="https://discord.com/blog/discord-family-center-stay-connected-with-your-teen" target="_blank">Family Center</a>, a tool that gives parents "greater visibility into the interactions and activities of their teens."</li><li>A spokesperson for Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, said in an email that the company has "created a number of tools specifically designed to help teens limit their time and minimize notifications, like Quiet Mode and Take a Break on Instagram, as well as supervision features that let parents set scheduled breaks when their teens can't use the app."</li></ul><h2>How parents can ask about social media</h2><p><a href="https://www.today.com/parents/teens/common-sense-phone-report-questions-parents-ask-teens-rcna117327" target="_blank">The experts at Common Sense suggest specific questions parents</a> can ask their kids to learn more about their smartphone use: What is your favorite app right now? Who are your favorite people to follow on social media? Can you teach me how to use Snapchat (or another social media platform)?</p><p>Steyer, a father of four, urges parents to remain nonjudgmental during such conversations and to be <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/role-models-parents-glued-screens-9-hours-day-n692541" target="_blank">open about </a><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/role-models-parents-glued-screens-9-hours-day-n692541" target="_blank">how much of </a><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/role-models-parents-glued-screens-9-hours-day-n692541" target="_blank">their own time and attention </a><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/role-models-parents-glued-screens-9-hours-day-n692541" target="_blank">they </a><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/role-models-parents-glued-screens-9-hours-day-n692541" target="_blank">spen</a><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/role-models-parents-glued-screens-9-hours-day-n692541" target="_blank">d</a><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/role-models-parents-glued-screens-9-hours-day-n692541" target="_blank"> online and with social media apps</a>. </p><p>He also recommends reserving threats to take a child's phone away as punishment to extreme circumstances only. </p><p>"Even though as a parent I have done that many times," Steyer said, children may not be as open about what they do online if they are constantly afraid of losing their phones.</p><p>"Kids have this extraordinary experience of childhood and adolescence that we did not have, but we can really help them through this," he said. "At the end of the day, it's good, old-fashioned, commonsense parenting that makes the difference."</p><p><strong><em>Follow&nbsp;</em></strong><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health"><strong><em>NBC HEALTH</em></strong></a><strong><em>&nbsp;on&nbsp;</em></strong><a href="https://twitter.com/NBCNewsHealth"><strong><em>Twitter</em></strong></a><strong><em>&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;</em></strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/NBCNewsHealth/"><strong><em>Facebook</em></strong></a><strong>.&nbsp;</strong></p></div><div><div data-activity-map="expanded-byline-article-bottom"><div><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/author/erika-edwards-ncpn56261"><picture><source srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_auto,q_auto:eco,dpr_2.0/newscms/2019_28/2925941/190612-erika-edwards-byline-30101.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2019_28/2925941/190612-erika-edwards-byline-30101.jpg 1x"><img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2019_28/2925941/190612-erika-edwards-byline-30101.jpg" alt="" height="48" width="48"></picture></a></div><p><span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/author/erika-edwards-ncpn56261">Erika Edwards</a></span><span><a href="https://twitter.com/erikaedwardsNBC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span></span></a><a href="mailto:erika.edwards@nbcuni.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span></span></a></span></p><p>Erika Edwards is a health and medical news writer and reporter for NBC News and "TODAY."</p></div><div data-activity-map="expanded-byline-article-bottom"><div><picture><source srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_auto,q_auto:eco,dpr_2.0/newscms/2014_01/94536/bio_katesnow-grid-4x2.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2014_01/94536/bio_katesnow-grid-4x2.jpg 1x"><img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2014_01/94536/bio_katesnow-grid-4x2.jpg" alt="" height="48" width="48"></picture></div><p><span>Kate Snow</span><span><a href="https://twitter.com/tvkatesnow" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span></span></a></span></p><p>Kate Snow is a national correspondent for NBC News.</p></div><div><p>Kate Redding </p><!-- --> <!-- --><p>contributed</p><!-- --><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-content-parent"><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:692/0*brehIk8zOOBRsM9n" alt=""></p>
<p>Classic DevOps misspell on a YAML</p>
<h2 id="heading-what-is-devops"><strong>What is DevOps?</strong></h2>
<p>If you are reading this article you already know it but for those in the back who don’t:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>DevOps is a culture, a movement, a philosophy if you will; that aims to foster collaboration during the</em> <strong><em>Software Development Life Cycle*</em></strong>.*</p>
</blockquote>
<p>DevOps is not a role or a set of tools or (just) a metodology.<br>It is indeed achieved by adopting tools, approaching to software the (real) agile way, creating processes and yes, hiring the right people too.</p>
<p>I’ve been around the DevOps/Cloud area of the IT industry for a few years now and I even <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mb-consulting.dev/service/devops-adoption-path">coach companies</a> about it.</p>
<p>In time, I experienced the DevOps adoption processes multiple times, in different kind of companies from day-1 all set to moving monolits to the Cloud.</p>
<p><em>Good old manual SysAdmin with long and complex bash scripted deploys?</em><br>Been there, done that.<br><em>Rising peaks of setting up GitOps in the cloud and spinning pods in a few clicks?</em><br>Tell me about it.</p>
<p>From just giving more responsibility of the Operations to Software Engineers to making Ops people aware of the software they were deploying and operating.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:500/0*oRwPuA9cgqWWENu2.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Yep, unfortunately enough Docker doesn’t solve all of your issues.</p>
<p>Like all the good things, in time, DevOps shifted to be something it is not.<br>A job title and a buzzword more than anything.<br>A role in which people are supposed to deal with a confusionary set of Cloud-related tasks ranging from the complex management of Kubernetes Clusters to the repellent manual IAM onboarding.<br>Ticket storming at them all day, left and right, leaving little time for meaningful tasks.</p>
<h2 id="heading-the-shift"><strong><em>The shift</em></strong></h2>
<p>Big techs aside, there are a few companies out there, able to implement and manage DevOps at scale and even some of those successful companies end up throwing away money, time and a number of engineers in the process.</p>
<p>Let’s dive into what I think could be some causes of this DevOps drift.</p>
<p><strong>1. DevOps/Cloud teams are overbooked</strong></p>
<p>On the bright side, if your company has a DevOps/Cloud team your are already one step ahead of your competitors: yay!</p>
<p>Wait a minute, this team handles: databases, networking, security policies, roles, cloud environments, accesses and security too.<br>Most probably through a messy IaC repository, writing poor Terraform code with little if any naming convention, no templating, all carefully handcrafted and repeated throughout your code base.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/0*-GmCgKeebCe9AMjW.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Or maybe it is just an illusion</p>
<p>You will soon discover how fast both your Software Engineering team and DevOps people can get frustrated, witnessing the effects of sedimented DevOps.</p>
<p><strong>2. Silos are (never really) broken, infrastructure is!</strong></p>
<p>Keeping everybody on track, aiming towards the same objective is not a walk in the park, even when you managed to break the infamous “silos”.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:480/1*jRqLifH66gVRGR4kEsIquw.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>The (in)famous silo being broken</p>
<p>Engineers get excited when building new stuff, not when manually maintaining old legacy items over and over, even if necessary.</p>
<p>We come to a neverending dilemma: <strong>rigidity</strong> is needed to handle infrastructure and avoid continuous maintenance, but <strong>flexibility</strong> is also needed in order to adapt components to ever-changing real-world requirements.</p>
<p><em>A mexican standoff.</em></p>
<p>We end up doing things quick and dirty in order to not get too frustrated and mostly to catch up with some impossible product deadline, which somehow never takes into account Ops.</p>
<p><em>I’m looking at you, product people, be aware of the Ops time!</em></p>
<p><strong>3. Create, configure, repeat</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes DevOps means copy-pasting the same code for every new instance/cluster/environment.<br>CTRL-C-CTRL-V-as-a-service and nobody really cares about it as long as that fix is done.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:406/1*t_xVbJagT3wPzX9e8UHEvA.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>Everybody (but that single repo nobody remembers about) gets a fix</p>
<p>That fix works until everything falls apart and it needs to be propagated in multiple repos without ever knowing if all the projects have been really fixed at that point.</p>
<p><em>Sounds funny, right?</em></p>
<p><strong>4. Software Engineering boundaries</strong></p>
<p>Software Engineers should not manage policies, roles, keys or be too aware of cloud regions, availability zones or networking in general.</p>
<p><em>These are kinda boring tasks for a SWE and definitely feels like old-fashioned filling paperwork.</em></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:480/1*ztezWwq4op_JTuag23mPDg.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>In the best case scenario code deployment should be as smooth as pushing on a git repo and everything else, infrastructure included, handled by some auto-magic black box.</p>
<h2 id="heading-the-solution"><strong>The solution</strong></h2>
<p>So what? Should we go back to Stone Age without any DevOps?<br>Of course not!</p>
<p>The IT industry has lately given its answer on the topic:</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://platformengineering.org/blog/what-is-platform-engineering"><strong>Platform Engineering</strong></a>.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:498/1*EdnOhdQ9vIoWMc67tElgDw.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>Classic Platform Engineering in the first implementaton phase</p>
<p>Flexible building blocks, customizable by experts and usable by any engineer, in a self-service fashion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>You build it, you run it*</em></strong>, you deploy it, you test it, you monitor it, but for real.*</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Considering DevOps as a double lane road to success, Platform Engineering can be pictured like a highway with guardrails, many more lanes, traffic management, police and toll booths.</p>
<h2 id="heading-explaining-platform-engineering"><strong>Explaining Platform Engineering</strong></h2>
<p><em>What is this Platform Engineering about?</em><br>In three words: <a target="_blank" href="https://internaldeveloperplatform.org/"><strong>Internal Development Platform</strong></a>.</p>
<p>You basically build a product for the best (or worst?) customer ever: your own engineering team.</p>
<p><em>Need to create a new API?</em><br>Just spin it up on the IDP, in a few second you can start writing your business logic and everything else is handled, auth and boilerplate code included!</p>
<p><em>No config for your need?</em><br>You can try to take the nearest existing one to adapt it with just a few lines of YAML.</p>
<p><em>What if a need changes or a new one arrives?</em><br>No biggie, let you Platform team build something from scratch and from that moment onwards everyone else can use it whenever they need.</p>
<p><em>This IDP seems cool but for real, what is it?<br>**</em>A composable platform with a catalog/marketplace** from which your teams can basically “shop” whatever they need to deliver value in way less time than without it.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Core components: git integrations, authentication/authorization standardized mechanisms, secrets handling, SSL certificates generation…</p>
</li>
<li><p>Blueprints for apps, CI/CD and even infrastructure code</p>
</li>
<li><p>An acceptable level of security, handled by design</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So what should I do with my DevOps teams? Ditch them?</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:500/0*kJh3KIPi0cYROfew" alt=""></p>
<p>Oh no.</p>
<p>Stop right there and listen!<br>Verticality is needed, more than ever. Platform Engineering allows Software Engineers to go back (just) coding and encourages the experts to collaborate in building something truly amazing such as an IDP.<br>DevOps are needed, Kubernetes ninjas are welcome and even a good old database administrator can be useful!</p>
<h2 id="heading-key-features-of-an-idp"><strong>Key features of an IDP</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Frontend</strong> — GUI should be developer friendly;</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Extendibility</strong> — Building blocks, blueprints, well-defined templates, modules, a catalog;</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Streamlined operations</strong> — Ways to standardize: provisioning, configuration, CI/CD, observability, environment management and multitenancy;</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Ease of experimentation</strong> — All the good things at a click distance to serve the engineers and enable their creativity aka “support whatever tool they need in an agnostic way”;</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Low lock-in mechanisms</strong> — Avoid a platform based on closed-source tools or just a single cloud provider;</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Security, Governance, Compliance</strong> — RBAC, logging, monitoring, alerting, auditing, login and access management, secrets, api keys, licenses… Easily accessible without learning tons of domain specific languages;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>What if I wanna build my own IDP from scratch?</em><br>Yes, you surely can, but, and this is a strong opinion I have, you shouldn’t start from zero, <strong>re-inventing the wheel all the time</strong>.<br>That’s part of what an IDP should solve!</p>
<p>A few examples of IDPs?</p>

<p>I’m not endorsed by any of the companies behind these products, even if it would be nice of them.<br><em>Where is my money, huh?</em></p>
<p>Jokes aside, I may have left behind other amazing pieces of software, feel free to drop some names in the comments.</p>
<p>Summarizing: Platform Engineering?<br><strong>A natural evolution of DevOps.</strong></p>
<p>2023 DevOps?<br>Not terrible.<br>You’ve just been clickbaited again!</p>

Sometimes it’s </span><em>absolutely</em><span> necessary to control for confounders: otherwise you might wind up with ridiculous implications like that </span><a href="https://www.cantorsparadise.com/will-you-drown-if-you-swim-after-eating-ice-cream-9890dc29ab7f" rel="">consuming ice cream causes drowning</a><span> (summer weather is the obvious confounding variable). However, there are trade-offs when adding complications to your analysis. Although it’s possible to err in either direction, there’s a general tendency to </span><a href="https://people.duke.edu/~mababyak/papers/babyakregression.pdf" rel="">overfit</a><span> models.</span></p><p><span>My keep-it-simple attitude is also a stress response from </span><a href="https://www.natesilver.net/p/twitter-elon-and-the-indigo-blob" rel="">years of experience arguing on the Internet</a><span>. Any time you can make your point using simple counting statistics or other very straightforward methods, I consider that a win. People </span><em>usually</em><span> aren’t really interested in the intricacies beyond a certain point. Most of the time, what Scott Alexander calls “</span><a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/08/14/beware-isolated-demands-for-rigor/" rel="">isolated demands for rigor</a><span>” — there’s always </span><em>some</em><span> factor you haven’t accounted for — are just stepping stones on the road to confirmation bias.</span></p><p><span>So my aim is generally to focus on </span><a href="http://finance.martinsewell.com/stylized-facts/" rel="">stylized facts</a><span> </span><strong>that are true and robust. </strong><span>And to keep repeating them. I like simple (or </span><em>simple-seeming</em><span>) claims that — and I can’t emphasize this last part enough — </span><strong>I expect </strong><em><strong>will</strong></em><strong> hold up to scrutiny</strong><span>. </span></p><p><span>How do I know when a claim is robust? Well, sometimes I’m wrong. But, honestly, experience helps. I’m an American, for instance, and so I’m much more confident when making claims about how a statistic varies American states than across Chinese provinces. And I have a lot of </span><a href="https://www.natesilver.net/p/what-its-like-to-run-deep-in-the" rel="">hands-on experience</a><span> with making statistically-driven decisions and putting money behind them.</span></p><p><span>It also helps to have kicked the tires on the claim a bit. Maybe you </span><em>have</em><span> run the more complicated version of the analysis. Or even better, maybe you’ve run it several different ways. And maybe you’ve consulted other research on the subject. If you’ve done this, and you’re getting a consistent answer, your claim is probably robust. When this is the case, I don’t think it’s necessarily worth your time — when writing for a popular audience — to prepare the equivalent of a 20,000-word journal article detailing all your methods, full of Greek characters and dozens of footnotes.</span></p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.natesilver.net/p/fine-ill-run-a-regression-analysis?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://www.natesilver.net/p/fine-ill-run-a-regression-analysis?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p><p><span>In a </span><a href="https://www.natesilver.net/p/the-2-key-facts-about-us-covid-policy" rel="">post</a><span> on Friday, I made two stylized claims that I believe to be true and robust:</span></p><blockquote><ul><li><p>Until vaccines became available, there was little difference in COVID death rates between blue states and red states.</p></li><li><p><span>After vaccines became available, there were clear differences, with red states having higher death rates, almost certainly as a result of </span><a href="https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/the-red-blue-divide-in-covid-19-vaccination-rates-continues-an-update/" rel="">lower vaccine uptake</a><span> among Republicans.</span></p></li></ul></blockquote><p><span>This wasn’t intended as any sort of super-duper hot take, and I pared the post down to avoid having too much of an attack surface.

The </span><a href="https://www.natesilver.net/p/the-2-key-facts-about-us-covid-policy/comments" rel="">comments</a><span> here were fairly civil, especially at first. (I really appreciate that, everyone.) Externally, though, these claims were more controversial. </span><a href="https://twitter.com/MartinKulldorff/status/1708210376267956570" rel="">Here</a><span> for instance, was Martin Kulldorff on Twitter/X:</span></p><blockquote><p>Children with large feet are better at math, but not after adjusting for age </p><p>Older people have &gt;1000 time higher Covid mortality, and state average age differ by &gt;10 years, so unadjusted state comparisons are misleading </p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/NateSilver538" rel="">@NateSilver538</a><span> may wish to consult a statistician</span></p></blockquote><p><span>Kulldorff is not just some </span><a href="https://twitter.com/Dame_Lillard?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor" rel="">casual</a><span>; he is a Professor of Medicine at Harvard.</span></p><p><span> He is also one of the lead authors of the </span><a href="https://gbdeclaration.org/" rel="">Great Barrington Declaration</a><span> (GBD), an October 2020 anti-lockdown statement signed by a large number of scientists and medical professionals. “Those who are not vulnerable should immediately be allowed to resume life as normal,” the statement read.</span></p><p><span>If you don’t know my history with COVID policy</span></p><p><span> and just think of me as Some Nerd Who Thinks The Vaccines Were Good, you’re probably expecting me to make fun of the GBD, which has been the </span><a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/12/23/at-a-time-when-the-u-s-needed-covid-19-dialogue-between-scientists-francis-collins-moved-to-shut-it-down/" rel="">subject of a lot of critical commentary</a><span>. But actually, I mostly agree with it. I think its claims about focused protection and herd immunity were too optimistic. But I think it was directionally right — that by October 2020, the evidence was on the side of the costs of these measures outweighing the benefits. I also think efforts to </span><a href="https://unherd.com/2022/12/what-i-discovered-at-twitter-hq/" rel="">suppress discussion of the GBD</a><span> and to </span><a href="https://www.lse.ac.uk/granthaminstitute/news/organisers-of-anti-lockdown-declaration-have-track-record-of-promoting-denial-of-health-and-environmental-risks/" rel="">label it as “misinformation”</a><span> were bullshit.</span></p><p><span>Of course, the first of the two claims I made in Friday’s post supported this very point. </span><em>Before</em><span> the introduction of vaccines, it isn’t clear that the other things we were doing to stop COVID were really working well at all — and they were very costly.</span></p><p><span>But on Twitter, I guess, you’ll rarely get credit for </span><em>half</em><span>-agreeing with someone. So Kulldorff took issue with my latter claim — that red states had higher death rates once vaccines became available — </span><a href="https://x.com/NateSilver538/status/1708156567797817373?s=20" rel="">arguing</a><span> that it was “meaningless” because I hadn’t adjusted for age.</span></p><p><span>Kulldorff’s argument is unsound. Age does explain some of the differences in COVID death rates between states. Certainly, COVID is </span><em><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9613797/" rel="">much, much</a></em><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9613797/" rel=""> more deadly for older people</a><span>, to an extent the media probably didn’t emphasize enough. But, this is almost entirely </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonality#:~:text=subchannel%20is%20required.-,Statistics%2C%20econometrics%2C%20and%20economics,covariance%20forms%20an%20inner%20product." rel="">orthogonal</a><span> to state partisanship — and even more so to vaccination rates.</span></p><p><span>As a quick aside, as someone who’s spent a lot of time looking at how behavioral and attitudinal data varies across American states, I think you should generally be suspicious when people attribute a lot of the differences to age. States don’t vary that much in age.</span></p><p><span> It isn’t like variables such as racial or religious prevalence, where the deltas can be much larger (e.g. Utah has </span><a href="https://www.thechurchnews.com/2021/6/11/23217750/latter-day-saint-populations-in-states-provinces-territories" rel="">100x</a><span> the Mormon population of some other states). Age also doesn’t really pass an eyeball test as explaining the differences between states in COVID death rates, as I </span><a href="https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/1708234347415818355" rel="">pointed out</a><span> to Kulldorff on Twitter:</span></p><blockquote><p>The four oldest states are West Virginia (very red), Florida (pretty red), Maine (pretty blue) and Vermont (very blue). What are their COVID death rates (per 1M population) since Feb. 1, 2021 (i.e. post-vaccine?): </p><p>West Virginia: 3454 </p><p>Florida: 2992 </p><p>Maine: 1881 </p><p>Vermont: 1210 </p><p>These states all have the ~same elderly population, and yet there are huge variations in COVID death rates that line up 1:1 with partisan differences in vaccine uptake.</p></blockquote><p><span>But OK, fine, let’s do this properly. Let’s run a </span><a href="https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1050&amp;context=law_and_economics" rel="">regression analysis</a><span>, which is a technique to decompose the effect of different variables.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p><span><span>S</span></span>hades? SPF50 suncream? Wide-brimmed hat? For decades, it has been drilled into us that if the sun is out, we’d better slip on protective clothing, slop on suncream and slap on a hat to stay safe. There’s little doubt that too much sun exposure – and particularly sunburn – increases our risk of developing skin cancer. It also prematurely ages the skin. But scientists are increasingly questioning the mantra that sunlight is an evil to be avoided at all costs, and investigating the brighter side of sun exposure.</p><p>It’s not just about vitamin D. Though important for strong bones and teeth this sun-induced vitamin is just the tip of the iceberg in terms of the physiological processes that are influenced by sunlight falling on the skin. Sunseekers may even have a longer lifespan. So, can we capitalise on the benefits of sunshine, without risking skin cancer?</p><p>As daytime creatures living on a sunny planet, we shouldn’t be surprised that our bodies may have evolved ways of turning the sun’s energy to our advantage. The skin is our largest organ and it is packed with sun-responsive chemicals and machinery, the most obvious being melanin – the pigment that gives skin its colour.</p><p>People with darker skin start out with more melanin, but its production is also triggered by exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation in sunlight. Melanin absorbs some of these UV rays, helping to protect skin cells from DNA damage – although this protection is limited, and even dark skin tones can get sunburn and other forms of sun damage such as hyperpigmentation and skin ageing.</p><p>One way in which sunlight switches on melanin production is through the release of a substance called beta-endorphin, which also plays a role in stress relief and pain management. This could be one reason why many people find sitting in the sun so relaxing.</p><p>Of course, sunbathing is a double-edged sword. The first clues that sunlight might be associated with an increased risk of skin cancer came in the late 1920s, when a British researcher called George Findlay observed that mice that were regularly irradiated with UV light developed tumours on their skin. Numerous studies have since shown that UV light triggers DNA mutations in skin cells which, left unchecked, could lead to skin cancer.</p><p>Puzzlingly though, despite facing an increased risk of skin cancer, people who are exposed to lots of sun appear to have longer <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/life-expectancy" data-link-name="in body link">life expectancies</a>, on average, than sun avoiders.</p><figure id="01e790e0-fee0-4ccc-bd14-df27460ca7a7" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-2"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebc1341c798ec0bc687f261f7dd65b2aa757f2ca/0_248_7330_4396/master/7330.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebc1341c798ec0bc687f261f7dd65b2aa757f2ca/0_248_7330_4396/master/7330.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1300px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebc1341c798ec0bc687f261f7dd65b2aa757f2ca/0_248_7330_4396/master/7330.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1140px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1140px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebc1341c798ec0bc687f261f7dd65b2aa757f2ca/0_248_7330_4396/master/7330.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1140px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebc1341c798ec0bc687f261f7dd65b2aa757f2ca/0_248_7330_4396/master/7330.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebc1341c798ec0bc687f261f7dd65b2aa757f2ca/0_248_7330_4396/master/7330.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 980px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebc1341c798ec0bc687f261f7dd65b2aa757f2ca/0_248_7330_4396/master/7330.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebc1341c798ec0bc687f261f7dd65b2aa757f2ca/0_248_7330_4396/master/7330.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebc1341c798ec0bc687f261f7dd65b2aa757f2ca/0_248_7330_4396/master/7330.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebc1341c798ec0bc687f261f7dd65b2aa757f2ca/0_248_7330_4396/master/7330.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebc1341c798ec0bc687f261f7dd65b2aa757f2ca/0_248_7330_4396/master/7330.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebc1341c798ec0bc687f261f7dd65b2aa757f2ca/0_248_7330_4396/master/7330.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="Good sun … is it time to reassess our relationship with exposure?" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebc1341c798ec0bc687f261f7dd65b2aa757f2ca/0_248_7330_4396/master/7330.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="266.8785811732606" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Good sun … is it time to reassess our relationship with exposure?</span> Photograph: Donald34/Getty Images/iStockphoto</figcaption></figure><p>This counterintuitive connection first came to light in 2014, when a Swedish researcher called Pelle Lindqvist published the results of a large <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/joim.12251" data-link-name="in body link">study that followed the health of around 30,000 women</a> over 20 years. It found that, on average, women who spent more time in the sun lived for one to two years longer than those who avoided the sun, even after taking into account factors such as wealth, education and exercise. This increased life expectancy appeared to stem from lower rates of cardiovascular disease and other non-cancer-related illnesses, including type 2 diabetes, autoimmune disease and chronic lung disease.</p><p>Other studies have since identified a similar pattern, including among pale-skinned Britons. In July, Richard Weller at the University of Edinburgh and his colleagues published a <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.07.11.23292360v1.full.pdf" data-link-name="in body link">preprint analysis</a> which drew on data from 376,729 people with white ancestry who were enrolled in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/mar/30/uk-biobank-medical-records-britons-online" data-link-name="in body link">UK Biobank Study</a> – an enormous online database of medical and lifestyle records – whose health was followed for an average of 13 years.</p><p>It found that those with more active sun-seeking behaviour were 14% less likely to die from any cause during the study period compared to sun avoiders, and their risk of death from cardiovascular disease was 19% lower.</p><p>Overall, more active sunseekers had around 50 extra days of survival, on average, while participants living in southern parts of the UK lived an 16 extra days, compared to those living 300 km farther north – even after adjusting for factors such as socioeconomic status.</p><p>“You might think that 50 days’ extra lifespan isn’t much, but at a population level, that’s huge,” Weller says. “Basically, after correcting for all the confounders, in Britain – just like in Sweden – the more sunlight people have, the longer they live.”</p><p>Curiously, active sunseekers’ risk of dying from cancer, including skin cancers, was also 14% lower. Weller says a similar pattern has been seen in other studies too. “We know that when melanoma is diagnosed, people with higher measured vitamin D levels have a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5627529/" data-link-name="in body link">better prognosis</a>,” he says.</p><p>Vitamin D is manufactured in our bodies when the UVB rays in sunlight react with a chemical in the skin called 7-dehydrocholesterol. Bone and muscle cells use it to regulate levels of calcium and phosphorus, which are needed to keep them strong and healthy, while immune cells also use it to help fend off harmful microbes and promote wound repair. Vitamin D receptors are also found on other body tissues including the heart and brain, and in recent years the list of illnesses associated with vitamin D deficiency has grown to include cardiovascular disease, infections and cancer.</p><p>Surprisingly though, large long-term trials assessing the impact of taking daily vitamin D supplements to prevent these conditions have produced <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37483080/" data-link-name="in body link">mixed results</a>, prompting some researchers to question whether they may have been looking at this from the wrong perspective. “Your vitamin D level is a biomarker that you have been in the sun, but it is not necessarily the active agent involved in human disease pathogenesis,” says Prof Prue Hart at the Telethon Kids Institute in Perth, Australia.</p><p>Hart is one of those investigating whether the sun’s UV rays are affecting our health in additional ways. Besides triggering DNA damage in our skin cells, another reason why excessive sun exposure may increase the risk of skin cancer is because because it dampens the activity of immune cells that would usually detect damaged cells and destroy them.</p><p>Yet some immune dampening may be beneficial, helping to temper overactive immune responses. Possibly, our immune systems even have evolved with this mildly immune-suppressive input from sunlight wired in. Now that we spend the majority of our lives indoors, this system may have fallen out of balance, increasing the risk of autoimmune disease.</p><p>Take multiple sclerosis, which is caused by the immune system mistakenly attacking the brain and nerves. Numerous epidemiological studies have associated higher lifetime exposures to sunlight with a lower risk of developing the condition.</p><p>Hart is now investigating whether exposing people with the earliest form of MS to UVB rays could halt or delay its progression. A pilot <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5954316/" data-link-name="in body link">study</a> in 20 individuals suggested that a year after undergoing such phototherapy, seven out of 10 people had developed MS, compared to all 10 of those who did not receive the treatment. Further experiments also revealed significant differences in their blood immune cell profiles – particularly their antibody-producing B cells.</p><figure id="2d70df4f-e83b-4271-97e0-ccb0d97c92a8" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-3"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43a2e5b77d56c9429cfd3b992f1d87ef2f61c98f/0_0_5017_3345/master/5017.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43a2e5b77d56c9429cfd3b992f1d87ef2f61c98f/0_0_5017_3345/master/5017.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1300px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43a2e5b77d56c9429cfd3b992f1d87ef2f61c98f/0_0_5017_3345/master/5017.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1140px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1140px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43a2e5b77d56c9429cfd3b992f1d87ef2f61c98f/0_0_5017_3345/master/5017.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1140px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43a2e5b77d56c9429cfd3b992f1d87ef2f61c98f/0_0_5017_3345/master/5017.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43a2e5b77d56c9429cfd3b992f1d87ef2f61c98f/0_0_5017_3345/master/5017.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 980px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43a2e5b77d56c9429cfd3b992f1d87ef2f61c98f/0_0_5017_3345/master/5017.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43a2e5b77d56c9429cfd3b992f1d87ef2f61c98f/0_0_5017_3345/master/5017.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43a2e5b77d56c9429cfd3b992f1d87ef2f61c98f/0_0_5017_3345/master/5017.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43a2e5b77d56c9429cfd3b992f1d87ef2f61c98f/0_0_5017_3345/master/5017.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43a2e5b77d56c9429cfd3b992f1d87ef2f61c98f/0_0_5017_3345/master/5017.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43a2e5b77d56c9429cfd3b992f1d87ef2f61c98f/0_0_5017_3345/master/5017.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="It is almost impossible to recommend specific amounts of “safe” sun exposure because everyone’s skin is different." src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43a2e5b77d56c9429cfd3b992f1d87ef2f61c98f/0_0_5017_3345/master/5017.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="296.69623280845127" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>It is almost impossible to recommend specific amounts of “safe” sun exposure because everyone’s skin is different.</span> Photograph: WideWorld/Alamy</figcaption></figure><p>Other mechanisms may also be at play. Like many dermatologists, Weller started his career believing sunlight was inherently damaging. But about 15 years ago, he discovered large stockpiles of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X15342780" data-link-name="in body link">nitric oxide</a> – a potent dilator of blood vessels – in human skin. Further research revealed that these stockpiles were activated by UVA rays, and that exposing individuals to a dose of UVA equivalent to spending about 20 minutes outdoors at noon during British summer time, resulted in a temporary, but significant drop in blood pressure.</p><p>Meanwhile, recent research by Prof Carmit Levy, at Tel Aviv University in Israel, found that sun exposure prompted the release of the “hunger hormone”<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/jul/11/sunlight-may-trigger-hormone-that-makes-men-hungrier-study-suggests" data-link-name="in body link"> ghrelin</a> in men’s skin. Here, the trigger appeared to be DNA damage. Besides regulating appetite, ghrelin also helps to reduce inflammation and blood pressure, so this could be another mechanism through which sun exposure exposure influences cardiovascular disease risk.</p><p>As evidence mounts for these potentially beneficial effects of sunlight, so do calls for a rethink of public health advice on how best to stay safe in the sun. In 2020, Weller, Hart, Lindqvist and 12 other researchers published a review in the <a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/private/pdf/264476/74-Sunshine-Health-Foundation-IQ-Appeal.pdf" data-link-name="in body link">International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health</a>, alerting doctors and policymakers to the “significant public health problem of insufficient sun exposure”.</p><p>While they don’t dispute that UV exposure is a major cause of skin cancer, they believe the “Slip, Slap, Slop” approach to sun avoidance – originally advocated by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/cancer" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Cancer</a> Council Australia, but now broadly adopted in other countries – may be damaging the health of people living in high-latitude countries such as the UK.</p><p>“The ‘Slip, Slap, Slop’ guidance is appropriate for the descendents of white-skinned north Europeans living in high-UV environments such as Australia, where they have a lot of skin cancer. But it is not appropriate for white-skinned Brits here in Scotland, and it is absolutely inappropriate for dark-skinned Brits, who have made the reverse migration from Africa or India,” says Weller.</p><p>So, what to do? What almost everyone agrees on is that the amount of sun exposure needed to stay healthy is far lower than the amount that causes sunburn.</p><p>The problem with advocating even limited sun exposure is that many people find it difficult to moderate, and it is almost impossible to recommend specific amounts of “safe” sun exposure because everyone’s skin is different, says Michelle Baker, CEO of the <a href="https://www.melanoma-fund.co.uk/" data-link-name="in body link">Melanoma Fund</a>, a charity which raises awareness of sun protection in sport and outdoor recreation. The sun’s intensity also varies hour to hour, day to day, and latitude to latitude.</p><p>One approach is to <a href="https://www.uvindex.app/" data-link-name="in body link">check the UV index</a>, which tells us how strong the sun’s UV rays are and when we’re most at risk of burning. If it is 3 or above, you need to think about protecting your skin – particularly if you have light skin or lots of moles or freckles, or a personal or family history of skin cancer.</p><p>Dr Walayat Hussain of the British Association of Dermatologists said: ‘[We] recommend that people avoid sunburn and heavy tanning, as these increase your chance of skin cancer. You don’t have to avoid the sun all year, but a few steps when out in the sunshine – whether this be in the UK or abroad on holiday – will help protect you. These steps include: protecting your skin with clothing, spending time in the shade when the UV index is high – typically between 11am and 3pm in the UK – and using sunscreen.” Baker stresses that using sunscreen will <em>not</em> make you vitamin D-deficient: “No matter how much you use or how high the SPF, some of the sun’s UV rays will reach your skin,” she says.</p><p>Weller also agrees that sunscreen is a sensible precaution. “Sunscreen is important because of the way we live our lives now, which is we get short, intense periods of sunlight on holiday, which is very unnatural,” he says. “Sunscreen definitely prevents skin ageing, and it prevents burning. It should be used for that – because that’s what matters.”</p><p>Even so, it may be time to move on from the idea that sun exposure is inherently bad. We still don’t know precisely what the optimal amount is – and it almost certainly varies from person to person – but what is becoming clear is that the effects of sun exposure are far greater than skin deep.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<a name="irish-logarithm" href="https://blog.plover.com/math/irish-logarithm.html">The Irish logarithm</a>
<br>
</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_logarithm">The Wikipedia article on “Irish logarithm”</a>
presents this rather weird little algorithm, invented by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percy_Ludgate">Percy
Ludgate</a>.  Suppose you want to multiply !!a!! and !!b!!,
where both are single-digit numbers !!0≤a,b≤9!!.</p>

<p>Normally you would just look it up on a multiplication table, but
please bear with me for a bit.</p>

<p>To use Ludgate's algorithm you need a different little table:</p>

<p>$$
\begin{array}{rl}
    T_1 = &amp;
    \begin{array}{cccccccccc}
           \tiny\color{gray}{0} &amp; \tiny\color{gray}{1} &amp; \tiny\color{gray}{2} &amp; \tiny\color{gray}{3} &amp; \tiny\color{gray}{4} &amp;  \tiny\color{gray}{5} &amp; \tiny\color{gray}{6} &amp;  \tiny\color{gray}{7} &amp; \tiny\color{gray}{8} &amp;  \tiny\color{gray}{9} \\ 
          50 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 7 &amp; 2 &amp; 23 &amp; 8 &amp; 33 &amp; 3 &amp; 14 \\
\end{array}
\end{array}
$$</p>

<p>and a different bigger one:</p>

<!-- table 1 -->

<p>$$
\begin{array}{rl}
    T_2 = &amp;
%   \left(
    \begin{array}{rrrrrrrrrrr}
    {\tiny\color{gray}{0}} &amp;    1, &amp; 2, &amp; 4, &amp; 8, &amp; 16, &amp; 32, &amp; 64, &amp; 3, &amp; 6, &amp; 12,   \\
    {\tiny\color{gray}{10}} &amp;   24, &amp; 48, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 9, &amp; 18, &amp; 36, &amp; 72, &amp; 0, &amp; 0,   \\
    {\tiny\color{gray}{20}} &amp;   0, &amp; 27, &amp; 54, &amp; 5, &amp; 10, &amp; 20, &amp; 40, &amp; 0, &amp; 81, &amp; 0,   \\
    {\tiny\color{gray}{30}} &amp;   15, &amp; 30, &amp; 0, &amp; 7, &amp; 14, &amp; 28, &amp; 56, &amp; 45, &amp; 0, &amp; 0,   \\
    {\tiny\color{gray}{40}} &amp;   21, &amp; 42, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 25, &amp; 63, &amp; 0, &amp; 0,   \\
    {\tiny\color{gray}{50}} &amp;   0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 35, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0,   \\
    {\tiny\color{gray}{60}} &amp;   0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 49\hphantom{,}
    \end{array}
%   \right)
\end{array}
$$</p>

<p>I've formatted !!T_2!! in rows for easier reading, but it's really
just a zero-indexed list
of !!101!! numbers.
So for example !!T_2(23)!! is !!5!!.</p>

<p>The tiny gray numbers in the margin are not part of the table, they
are counting the elements so that it is easy to find element !!23!!.</p>

<p>Ludgate's algorithm is simply:</p>

<p>$$
ab = T_2(T_1(a) + T_1(b))
$$</p>

<p>Let's see an example.
Say we want to multiply !!4×7!!.  We
first look up !!4!! and !!7!! in !!T_1!!, and get !!2!! and
!!33!!, which we add, getting !!35!!.  Then !!T_2(35)!!
is !!28!!, which is the correct answer.</p>

<p>This isn't useful for paper-and-pencil calculation, because it only
works for products up to !!9×9!!, and an ordinary multiplication table
is easier to use and remember.  But Ludgate invented this for use in a
mechanical computing engine, for which it is much better-suited.</p>

<p>The table lookups are mechanically very easy. They are simple
one-dimensional lookups: to find !!T_1(6)!! you just look at entry
!!6!! in the !!T_1!! table, which can be implemented as a series of
ten metal rods of different lengths, or something like that.  Looking
things up in a multiplication table is harder because it is two-dimensional.</p>

<p>The single addition in Ludgate's algorithm can also be performed
mechanically: to add !!T_1(a)!! and !!T_1(b)!!, you have some thingy
that slides up by !!T_1(a)!! units, and then by !!T_1(b)!!  more, and
then wherever it ends up is used to index into !!T_2!! to get the
answer.  The !!T_2!!  table doesn't have to be calculated on the fly,
it can be made up ahead of time, and machined from brass or something,
and incorporated directly into the machine.  (It's tempting to say
“hardcoded”.)</p>

<p>The tables look a little uncouth at first but it is not hard to figure
out what is going on. First off, !!T_1!! is the inverse of !!T_2!! in
the sense that $$T_2(T_1(n)) = n\tag{$\color{darkgreen}{\spadesuit}$}$$</p>

<p>whenever !!n!! is in range&nbsp;— that is when !!0≤ n ≤ 9!!.</p>

<p>!!T_2!! is more complex.  We must construct it so that</p>

<p>$$T_2(T_1(a) + T_1(b)) = ab.\tag{$\color{purple}{\clubsuit}$}$$</p>

<p>for all !!a!! and !!b!! of interest, which means that !!0\le a, b\le
9!!.</p>

<p>If you look over the table you should see that the entry !!n!! is
often followed by !!2n!!.   That is, !!T_2(i+1) = 2T_2(i)!!, at least
some of the time.  And in fact, this is true in all the cases we care
about, where !!2n = ab!! for some single digits !!a, b!!. </p>

<p>The second row could just as well have started with !!24, 48, 96,
192!!, but Ludgate doesn't need the !!96, 192!! entries, so he made
them zero, which really means “I don't care”.  This will be important
later.</p>

<p>The algorithm says that if
we want to
compute !!2n!!, we should compute
$$ \begin{align}
2n
 &amp; = T_2(T_1(2) + T_1(n)) &amp;&amp; \text{Because $\color{purple}{\clubsuit}$} \\
 &amp; = T_2(1 + T_1(n)) \\
 &amp; = 2T_2(T_1(n))         &amp;&amp; \text{Because moving one space right doubles the value}\\
 &amp; = 2n                   &amp;&amp; \text{Because $\color{darkgreen}{\spadesuit}$}
\end{align}
$$</p>

<p>when !!0≤n≤9!!.</p>

<p>I formatted !!T_2!! in rows of !!10!! because that makes it easy to
look up examples like !!T_2(35) = 28!!, and because that's how
Wikipedia did it.  But this is very misleading, and not just because
it makes !!T_2!!  appear to be a !!10×10!! table when it's really a
vector.  !!T_2!! is actually more like a compressed version of a
!!7×4×3×3!! table.</p>

<p>Let's reformat the table so that the rows have length !!7!! instead of !!10!!:</p>

<!-- table 2 -->

<p>$$
\begin{array}{rrrrrrrr}
    {\tiny\color{gray}{0}} &amp; 1, &amp; 2, &amp; 4, &amp; 8, &amp; 16, &amp; 32, &amp; 64,   \\
    {\tiny\color{gray}{7}} &amp; 3, &amp; 6, &amp; 12, &amp; 24, &amp; 48, &amp; 0, &amp; 0,   \\
    {\tiny\color{gray}{14}} &amp; 9, &amp; 18, &amp; 36, &amp; 72, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0,   \\
    {\tiny\color{gray}{21}} &amp; 27, &amp; 54, &amp; 5, &amp; 10, &amp; 20, &amp; 40, &amp; 0,   \\
    {\tiny\color{gray}{28}} &amp; 81, &amp; 0, &amp; 15, &amp; 30, &amp; 0, &amp; 7, &amp; 14,   \\
    {\tiny\color{gray}{35}} &amp; 28, &amp; 56, &amp; 45, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 21, &amp; 42,   \\
    {\tiny\color{gray}{42}} &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 25, &amp; 63, &amp; 0,   \\
    {\tiny\color{gray}{49}} &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0,   \\
    {\tiny\color{gray}{56}} &amp; 35, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0,   \\
    {\tiny\color{gray}{63}} &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 49 \\
\end{array}
$$</p>

<p>We have already seen that moving one column right usually multiplies
the entry by !!2!!.  Similarly, moving down by one row is seen to
triple the !!T_2!! value&nbsp;— not always, but in all the cases of
interest.  Since the rows have length !!7!!, moving down one row from
!!T_2(i)!! gets you to !!T_2(i+7)!!, and this is why !!T_1(3) = 7!!:
to compute !!3n!!, one does:</p>

<p>$$ \begin{align}
3n
 &amp; = T_2(T_1(3) + T_1(n)) &amp;&amp; \text{Because $\color{purple}{\clubsuit}$} \\
 &amp; = T_2(7 + T_1(n)) \\
 &amp; = 4T_2(T_1(n))         &amp;&amp; \text{Because moving down triples the value}\\
 &amp; = 3n                   &amp;&amp; \text{Because $\color{darkgreen}{\spadesuit}$}
\end{align}
$$</p>

<p>Now here is where it gets clever.  It would be straightforward easy to build !!T_2!!
as a stack of !!5×7!! tables, with each layer in the stack having
entries  quintuple the layer above, like this:</p>

<!-- table 3 -->

<p>$$
\begin{array}{rrrrrrrr}
    {\tiny\color{gray}{0}} &amp; 1, &amp; 2, &amp; 4, &amp; 8, &amp; 16, &amp; 32, &amp; 64,   \\
    {\tiny\color{gray}{7}} &amp; 3, &amp; 6, &amp; 12, &amp; 24, &amp; 48, &amp; 0, &amp; 0,   \\
    {\tiny\color{gray}{14}} &amp; 9, &amp; 18, &amp; 36, &amp; 72, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0,   \\
    {\tiny\color{gray}{21}} &amp; 27, &amp; 54, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0,   \\
    {\tiny\color{gray}{28}} &amp; 81, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0,   \\
    \\
    {\tiny\color{gray}{35}} &amp; 5, &amp; 10, &amp; 20, &amp; 40, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0,   \\
    {\tiny\color{gray}{42}} &amp; 15, &amp; 30, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0,   \\
    {\tiny\color{gray}{49}} &amp; 45, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0,   \\
    {\tiny\color{gray}{56}} &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0,   \\
    {\tiny\color{gray}{63}} &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0,   \\
    \\
    {\tiny\color{gray}{70}} &amp; 25, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0,   \\
    {\tiny\color{gray}{77}} &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0,   \\
    {\tiny\color{gray}{84}} &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0,   \\
    {\tiny\color{gray}{91}} &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0,   \\
    {\tiny\color{gray}{98}} &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0,   \\
\end{array}
$$</p>

<p>This works, if we make !!T_1(5)!! the correct offset, which is !!7·5 =
35!!.  But it wastes space, and the larger !!T_2!! is, the more
complicated and expensive is the brass thingy that encodes it.  The
last six entries of the each layer in the stack are don't-cares, so we
can just omit them:</p>

<!-- table 4 -->

<p>$$
\begin{array}{rrrrrrrr}
    {\tiny\color{gray}{0}} &amp; 1, &amp; 2, &amp; 4, &amp; 8, &amp; 16, &amp; 32, &amp; 64,   \\
    {\tiny\color{gray}{7}} &amp; 3, &amp; 6, &amp; 12, &amp; 24, &amp; 48, &amp; 0, &amp; 0,   \\
    {\tiny\color{gray}{14}} &amp; 9, &amp; 18, &amp; 36, &amp; 72, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0,   \\
    {\tiny\color{gray}{21}} &amp; 27, &amp; 54, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0,   \\
    {\tiny\color{gray}{28}} &amp; 81, \\
    \\
    {\tiny\color{gray}{29}} &amp; 5, &amp; 10, &amp; 20, &amp; 40, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0,   \\
    {\tiny\color{gray}{36}} &amp; 15, &amp; 30, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0,   \\
    {\tiny\color{gray}{43}} &amp; 45, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0,   \\
    {\tiny\color{gray}{50}} &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0,   \\
    {\tiny\color{gray}{57}} &amp; 0, \\
    \\
    {\tiny\color{gray}{58}} &amp; 25, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0,   \\
    {\tiny\color{gray}{65}} &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0,   \\
    {\tiny\color{gray}{72}} &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0,   \\
    {\tiny\color{gray}{79}} &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0,   \\
    {\tiny\color{gray}{86}} &amp; 0\hphantom{,} \\
\end{array}
$$</p>

<p>And to compensate we make !!T_1(5) = 29!! instead of !!35!!: you now
move down one layer in the stack by skipping !!29!! entries forward, instead
of !!35!!.</p>

<p>The table is still missing all the multiples of !!7!!, but we can
repeat the process.  The previous version of !!T_2!! can now be
thought of as a !!29×3!!  table, and we can stack another !!29×3!!
table below it, with all the entries in the new layer being !!7!!
times the original one:</p>

<p>Each layer in the stack has !!29·3 = 87!! entries, so we could take
!!T_1(7) = 87!! and it would work, but the last !!28!! entries in
every layer are zero, so we can discard those and reduce the layers to
!!59!!  entries each. </p>

<p>Doing this has reduced the layers from !!87!! to !!59!! elements each,
but Ludgate has another trick up his sleeve.  The last few 
numbers in the top layer are !!45, 25,!! and a lot of zeroes. 
If he could somehow finesse !!45!! and !!25!!,
he could trim the top two layers all the way back to only 38 entries each:</p>

<p>We're now missing !!25!! and we need to put it back.
Fortunately the place we want to put it is 
!!T_1(5) + T_1(5) = 29+29 = 58!!, and that slot contains a zero
anyway.  And similarly we want to put !!45!! at position !!14+29 =
43!!, also empty:</p>

<p>The arithmetic pattern is no longer as obvious, but property !!\color{purple}{\clubsuit}!!
still holds</p>

<p>We're not done yet!  The table still has a lot of zeroes we can squeeze
out.  If we change !!T_1(5)!! from !!29!! to !!23!!, the
!!5,10,20,40!! group will slide backward to just after the !!54!!, and the !!15,
30!! will move to the row below that.</p>

<p>We will also have to move the
other multiples of !!5!!. The !!5!! itself moved back by six entries, and so
did everything after that in the table, including the !!35!! (from
position !!32+29!! to !!32+23!!) and the !!45!! (from position
!!14+29!! to !!14+23!!) so those are  still in the right
places.  Note that this means that !!7!! has moved from position
!!38!! to
position !!32!!, so we now have !!T_1(7) = 32!!.</p>

<p>But the !!25!! is giving us trouble.  It needed to move back twice
as far as the others, from !!29+29 = 58!! to !!23+23 = 46!!, and
unfortunately it now collides with !!63!! which is currently at position
!!7+7+32 = 46!!.</p>

<p>We need another tweak to fix !!25!!.  !!7!! is currently at
position !!32!!.  We can't move !!7!! any farther back to the left
without causing more collisions.  But we can move it <em>forward</em>, and if
we move it forward by one space, the !!63!! will move up one space also
and the collision with !!25!! will be solved.  So we insert a zero between
!!30!!  and !!7!!, which moves up !!7!! from position !!32!! to
!!33!!:</p>

$$</p>

<p>All the other multiples of !!7!! moved up by one space, but not the
non-multiples !!25!! and !!45!!.  Also !!49!! had to move up by two,
but that's no problem at all, since it was at the end of the table and
has all the space it needs.</p>

<p>And now we are done!  This is exactly Ludgate's table, which has the
property that</p>

<p>$$T_2(p + 7q + 23r + 33s) = 2^p3^q5^r7^s$$</p>

<p>whenever !!2^p3^q5^r7^s = ab!! for some !!0≤a,b≤9!!.
Moving right by one space multiplies the !!T_2!! entry
by !!2!!, at least for the entries we care about.  Moving right by
seven spaces multiplies the entry by !!3!!.  To multiply by !!5!! or
!!7!! we move right by or !!23!! or by !!33!!, respectively.</p>

<p>These are exactly the values in the !!T_1!! table:</p>

<p>$$\begin{align}
T_1(2) &amp; = 1\\
T_1(3) &amp; = 7\\
T_1(5) &amp; = 23\\
T_1(7) &amp; = 33
\end{align}$$</p>

<p>The rest of the !!T_1!! table can be obtained by remembering !!\color{darkgreen}{\spadesuit}!!,
that !!T_2(T_1(n)) = n!!, so for example !!T_1(6) = 8!! because
!!T_2(8) = 6!!.  Or we can get !!T_1(6)!! by multiplication, using !!\color{purple}{\clubsuit}!!:
multiplying by !!6!! is the same as multiplying by !!2!! and then by
!!3!!, which means you move right by !!1!! and then by !!7!!, for a
total of !!8!!.  Here's !!T_1!! again for reference:</p>

<p>$$
\begin{array}{rl}
    T_1 = &amp;
    \begin{array}{cccccccccc}
           0 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 &amp;  5 &amp; 6 &amp;  7 &amp; 8 &amp;  9 \\ \hline
          50 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 7 &amp; 2 &amp; 23 &amp; 8 &amp; 33 &amp; 3 &amp; 14 \\
    \end{array}
\end{array}
$$</p>

<p>(Actually I left out a detail: !!T_1(0) = 50!!.
Ludgate wants !!T_2(T_1(0) + T_1(b)) = 0!! for all !!b!!. So
we need !!T_2(T_1(0) + k) = 0!! for each !!k!!  in !!T_1!!.
!!T_1(0) = 50!! is the smallest value that works.  This is rather
painful, because it means that 
the !!66!!-item table aboveis not sufficient.  Ludgate has to extend
!!T_2!! all the way out to !!101!!
items in order to handle the seemingly trivial case of !!0\cdot 0 =
T_2(50 + 50)!!.  But the last 35 entries are all zeroes, so the
the brass widget probably doesn't have to be too much more complicated.)</p>

<p>Wasn't that fun?  A sort of mathematical engineering or a kind that is
not been really useful for at least fifty years.</p>

<p>But actually that was not what I planned to write about!  (Did you
guess that was coming?)  I thought I was going to write this bit as a
brief introduction to something else,  but the brief introduction turned out
to be 2500 words and a dozen complicated tables.</p>

<p>We can only hope that part 2 is forthcoming.  I promise nothing.</p>

<p><strong>GNU/Linux is a free and open source software operating system for computers.</strong> The operating system is a collection of the basic instructions that tell the electronic parts of the computer what to do and how to work. Free, Libre and open source software (FLOSS) means that everyone has the freedom to use it, see how it works, and change it.</p>

<p>GNU/Linux is a collaborative effort between the GNU project, formed in 1983 to develop the GNU operating system and the development team of Linux, a kernel. Linux is also used without GNU in embedded systems, mobile phones, and more. These can include things like Android or ChromeOS. GNU itself is also used without Linux, some examples appear in projects like Debian/kFreebsd and Guix GNU/Hurd.</p>

<h2>Rules</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/about/rules/">Please review full details on rules here.</a>. All rules will be applied regardless of the number upvotes a post/comment has.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>No support requests</strong> - This is not a support forum! Head to <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/linuxquestions">/r/linuxquestions</a> or <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/linux4noobs">/r/linux4noobs</a> for support or help. Looking for a distro? Try <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/findmeadistro">r/findmeadistro</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No spamblog submissions</strong> - Posts should be submitted using the original source with the original title. Posts that are identified as either blog-spam, a link aggregator, or an otherwise low-effort website are to be removed. Some reasons for removal are that they contain re-hosted content, usually paired with privacy-invading ads. If there's another discussion on the topic, the link is welcome to be submitted as a top level comment to aid the previous discussion. Please see: <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/linux/wiki/rules/banneddomains">r/linux/wiki/rules/banneddomains</a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>No memes, image macros, rage comics, overdone jokes</strong> - Meme posts of any kind are not allowed in <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/linux">r/linux</a>. Feel free to post over at <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/linuxmemes">/r/linuxmemes</a> instead. This rule can also apply to comments, including overdone jokes, comment-chain jokes, or other redditisms that are popular elsewhere.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Reddiquette, trolling, or poor discussion</strong> - <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/linux">r/linux</a> asks all users follow <a href="https://www.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/205926439">Reddiquette.</a> Reddiquette is ever changing, so a revisit once in awhile is recommended. Top violations of this rule are trolling, starting a flamewar, or not "Remembering the human" aka being hostile or incredibly impolite. Additionally, sexism/racism/other isms are not allowed. See also: <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/linux/wiki/rules/userconduct">/r/linux/wiki/rules/userconduct</a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Relevance to <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/linux">r/linux</a> community / Promoting closed source applications over FOSS</strong> - Posts should follow what the community likes: GNU, Linux kernel, developers of open source software, or other applications on Linux. Take some time to get the feel of the subreddit if you're not sure!</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Spamming self-promotion, surveys, crowdfunding</strong> - Submitting your own original content is welcome on <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/linux">r/linux</a>, but we do ask that you contribute more than just your own content to the subreddit as well as require you to interact with the comments of your submission. We set that no more than 10% of your posts should be your content. Please be aware that this does not supersede other rules. Additionally, surveys for your blog/news source/paper/own use are not allowed. Please see <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/linux/wiki/rules/crowdfunding">/r/linux/wiki/rules/crowdfunding</a> for those crowdfunding..</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No misdirecting links, sites that require a login, or URL shorteners</strong> - In short: if your link doesn't go right to the content it will be removed. Sites that require a login to view the content are not allowed in <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/linux">r/linux</a>. Example: A private Facebook post or a news organization that doesn't have free article views. URL shorteners and links that misdirect users to ads/jokes are also banned. See a list here, although the mods will make a decision on a per domain basis as needed: <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/linux/wiki/rules/banneddomains">/r/linux/wiki/rules/banneddomains</a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>No NSFW</strong> - No NSFW links or images without mod approval. No discussion that is overly-suggestive to what is normally considered NSFW.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Non-useful Image Upload/Fluff Image</strong> - Images of "Linux in the wild", plushies, Tux, and more are not encouraged for posting as a top level submission. If necessary, this can apply to comments too at mod discretion. The image/video upload feature is for posts regarding features/guides/etc. See also: Meme rule.</p></li>
