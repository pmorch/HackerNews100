            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/09/tiktok-tells-la-staff-impacted-by-wildfires-to-use-personal-sick-hours-if-they-cant-work-from-home/">https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/09/tiktok-tells-la-staff-impacted-by-wildfires-to-use-personal-sick-hours-if-they-cant-work-from-home/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42652056">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p id="speakable-summary">Wildfires are currently <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/california-windstorm-fuels-pacific-palisades-wildfire-as-residents-flee-live-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">devastating the greater Los Angeles area</a>, burning over 45 square miles, torching over 1,300 structures, and putting nearly 180,000 people under evacuation orders as of Thursday. And yet, TikTok’s LA-based employees are being told to either continue their work from home or use their personal/sick days if that’s not possible, while the company’s LA office remains closed due to power outages caused by high winds.</p>

<p>Already, the Palisades Fire is close enough to TikTok’s office that smoke can be seen out the windows. But although the Culver City-based office itself is <a href="https://www.culvercity.org/News/LA-Wildfire-Update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">not under mandatory evacuation orders</a> at this time, both it and many employees’ homes are impacted by the fires, windstorms, and related problems.</p>







<p>TikTok’s employees in the region hail from all over the broader LA area — some even commuting hours into work — and many of their homes are currently without power, Wi-Fi, or both, we understand from employee sources at TikTok. Some could even be under evacuation orders of their own (though we have not directly confirmed this at this time).</p>

<p>Unfortunately for staff dealing with this large-scale natural disaster, TikTok is telling them to use their personal or sick time to account for the days they need to take off due to these conditions.</p>

<p>In messages from TikTok leadership to LA staff, the company informed employees that the LA office would be closed on January 8 and would remain closed through Sunday, January 12, as the fires continued to ravage the area and the office itself is without power. The days the office is closed are being made Work From Home days as opposed to days off, however — unless an individual team leader decides otherwise. </p>

<p>In one message, an HR representative shared links to other company resources for those impacted by the fires, including a Mental Wellbeing Portal, a way to sign up for free mental health sessions with <a href="https://www.lyrahealth.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Lyra</a>, and a link to TikTok’s “PSSL” policy. The latter refers to TikTok’s paid sick and safe leave program — essentially, sick time and personal days.</p>

<p>TikTok’s LA employees have 10 paid sick/personal (PSSL) days per year in addition to 15 PTO (paid time off/vacation) days, if they were hired before June. These sick/personal days are highly coveted, too, as TikTok’s strict return-to-office policy requires employees to work from the office a minimum of three days per week. (The days of the week are chosen by the team and can’t be swapped for other days if needed.)</p>


<p>That means if an employee is feeling unwell, like with a simple cold or flu, and they don’t want to spread their illness to coworkers, they do have the option to stay home. But because they’re required to be in the office for three days each week, they would still have to use their PSSL hours and take the day off on those working-from-home-while-sick days (rather than being allowed to work from home with no penalty).</p>

<p>This week, TikTok’s LA staff are being asked to use their personal/sick days if&nbsp;they cannot work from home due to power or Wi-Fi outages, or if they’re under evacuation orders (unless their entire team has been given time off, which is not the case for many impacted by the fires). This leaves them fewer days later in the year to use in case of an actual illness or other personal emergency, like staying home to care for a sick child. If they don’t have enough PSSL hours available, they can either borrow from next year or use their PTO time instead, we understand.</p>

<p>Employees who can work from home still must go into their “My RTO” portal, where they manage their sick time, and change their work-from-home status to “natural disaster” to not be penalized. This won’t subtract from their PSSL hours, though. </p>







<p>Meanwhile, TikTok’s PSSL policy documentation doesn’t specifically state that the time can be used for natural disasters, such as these massive wildfires.</p>

<p>Instead, the policy says employees can use the time for either a physical or mental health condition, to take care of a family member with a health condition, or if the office is closed by the “order of public officials” due to a public health emergency, including exposures to an infectious agent, biological toxin, or hazardous material. (While, arguably, smoke in the area could be “hazardous,” not every TikTok LA employee facing poor air quality is also under an evacuation order enacted by a public official.)</p>

<p>In several internal messages shared with us, employees are reporting their home has no power, or their city overall has no power. (News reports indicate that some <a href="https://ktla.com/news/california/wildfires/millions-without-power-in-southern-california-map-shows-latest-outages/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">4 million people are without power</a> due to the wildfires as of yesterday.) Some employees are worried about how bad their air quality is getting. Others are worried about using up their precious battery power or generator fuel just to work at home, as it’s unclear how long these power outages will last.</p>

<p>Given the pressure TikTok is under due to the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/28/trump-asks-supreme-court-to-pause-imminent-tiktok-ban/">upcoming ban in the U.S.</a>, which is probably already impacting U.S. employees’ mental health and stress levels, being told to keep working through a disaster of this scale comes across as a little tone-deaf. In fact, some internal messages reviewed by TechCrunch have very much a “business-as-usual” vibe to them despite the scale of the disaster at hand. One lead, for example, reached out to an employee without power for a status update on some of their work, messages show. </p>

<p>Employees have been told to contact the EAP (Employee Assistance Program) or their HR rep if they are told they need to evacuate. Though there are many messages from leaders stressing that employees should put their own safety and well-being first, asking staff to worry about using personal days if they can’t work from home seems to counter that narrative.</p>

<p>TikTok was asked for comment but didn’t offer a response ahead of publication. After publication, the company issued a statement, shared with TechCrunch. (See below). </p>

<p>TikTok claims that any communications to LA employees telling them to use personal time if they can’t work from home due to fires, power outages or internet issues must be a misunderstanding. (We should note that we’ve seen screenshots of TikTok HR’s communications to staff that contradict these claims. Additionally, after the story was published, TikTok enabled a feature that now alerts everyone in a company-wide Lark channel — <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lark_(software)">a Slack competitor from TikTok parent ByteDance</a> — when a screenshot is taken.)</p>

<p>“The safety and well-being of our employees is our highest priority,” a TikTok spokesperson said. “In light of current circumstances, our offices have been closed since Tuesday and will remain so for as long as necessary. While employees who can work from home safely are encouraged to do so, we also recognize the unique challenges this situation may present and are committed to supporting our team with flexibility if they are unable to work remotely at this time.”</p>

Because much of the collection is occurring through the advertising ecosystem—not code developed by the app creators themselves—this data collection is likely happening without users’ or even app developers’ knowledge.</p><p>“For the first time publicly, we seem to have proof that one of the largest data brokers selling to both commercial and government clients appears to be acquiring their data from the online advertising ‘bid stream,’” rather than code embedded into the apps themselves, Zach Edwards, senior threat analyst at cybersecurity firm Silent Push and who has followed the location data industry closely, tells 404 Media after reviewing some of the data.</p><p>The data provides a rare glimpse inside the world of real-time bidding (RTB). Historically, location data firms <a data-offer-url="https://www.vice.com/en/article/us-military-location-data-xmode-locate-x/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.vice.com/en/article/us-military-location-data-xmode-locate-x/&quot;}" href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/us-military-location-data-xmode-locate-x/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">paid app developers</a> to include bundles of code that collected the location data of their users.

But a side effect is that data brokers can listen in on that process and harvest the location of peoples’ mobile phones.</p><p>“This is a nightmare scenario for privacy, because not only does this data breach contain data scraped from the RTB systems, but there's some company out there acting like a global honey badger, doing whatever it pleases with every piece of data that comes its way,” Edwards says.</p><p>Included in the hacked Gravy data are tens of millions of mobile phone coordinates of devices inside the US, Russia, and Europe. Some of those files also reference an app next to each piece of location data. 404 Media extracted the app names and built a list of mentioned apps.</p><p>The list includes dating sites Tinder and Grindr; massive games such as <em>Candy Crush</em>, <em>Temple Run</em>, <em>Subway Surfers</em>, and <em>Harry Potter: Puzzles &amp; Spells</em>; transit app Moovit; My Period Calendar &amp; Tracker, a period-tracking app with more than 10 million downloads; popular fitness app MyFitnessPal; social network Tumblr; Yahoo’s email client; Microsoft’s 365 office app; and flight tracker Flightradar24. The list also mentions multiple religious-focused apps such as Muslim prayer and Christian Bible apps, various pregnancy trackers, and many VPN apps, which some users may download, ironically, in an attempt to protect their privacy.</p><p>The full list can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ukgd0gIWd9gpV6bOx2pcSHsVO6yIUqbjnlM4ewjO6Cs/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.

Most app developers and companies included in the list did not respond to a request for comment. Flightradar24 said in an email that it had never heard of Gravy, but that it does display ads, which “help keep Flightradar24 free.”</p><p>Tinder said in an email that “Tinder takes safety and security very seriously. We have no relationship with Gravy Analytics and have no evidence that this data was obtained from the Tinder app” but did not answer questions about ads inside the app.</p><p>Muslim Pro, one of the Muslim prayer apps included in the list, said in an email that it was not aware of Gravy. “Yes, we display ads through several ad networks to support the free version of the app. However, as mentioned above, we do not authorize these networks to collect location data of our users,” the email said. That does not necessarily mean that a member of the advertising ecosystem can’t extract such data, though. (In 2020 <a data-offer-url="https://www.vice.com/en/article/muslim-pro-location-data-military-xmode/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.vice.com/en/article/muslim-pro-location-data-military-xmode/&quot;}" href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/muslim-pro-location-data-military-xmode/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">I revealed Muslim Pro was selling its users’ location data</a> to a company called X-Mode, whose clients included US military contractors; Muslim Pro stopped the practice after my reporting.)</p><p>A Grindr spokesperson told 404 Media in an email that “Grindr has never worked with or provided data to Gravy Analytics. We do not share data with data aggregators or brokers and have not shared geolocation with ad partners for many years. Transparency is at the core of our privacy program, therefore the third parties and service providers we work with are listed here <a data-offer-url="https://www.grindr.com/privacy-policy/third-parties/en-us" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.grindr.com/privacy-policy/third-parties/en-us&quot;}" href="https://www.grindr.com/privacy-policy/third-parties/en-us" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">on our website</a>.” Grindr <a data-offer-url="https://lamag.com/news/grindr-sold-its-user-data-for-years-revealing-personal-information" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://lamag.com/news/grindr-sold-its-user-data-for-years-revealing-personal-information&quot;}" href="https://lamag.com/news/grindr-sold-its-user-data-for-years-revealing-personal-information" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">was previously found to have allowed data brokers</a> to obtain its users’ location data.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>It’s important that the data appears to be sourced through real-time bidding, because that dictates who is responsible (rogue members of the advertising industry and the tech giants that facilitate that industry), how users can protect themselves (attempting to block ads), and the fact that massive app publishers may not even be aware their users’ data is being harvested and therefore might not know how to stop it. An app developer will know if it implemented location-data-gathering code itself. It might not know that some company, somewhere, is silently listening in on the advertising process and siphoning data from their app.</p><p>Surveillance firms can obtain RTB data by <a data-offer-url="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-11/surveillance-company-turns-ad-data-into-government-tracking-tool?ref=404media.co" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-11/surveillance-company-turns-ad-data-into-government-tracking-tool?ref=404media.co&quot;}" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-11/surveillance-company-turns-ad-data-into-government-tracking-tool?ref=404media.co" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">acquiring ad tech companies</a> and posing as prospective advertisers. The spy-run location data company doesn’t need to successfully place an ad; instead, it is able to gather data on devices by simply being plugged into that industry. Location data in this case can also include a users’ IP address, which is then geolocated to give their coarse location.</p><p>Last January, <a data-offer-url="https://www.404media.co/inside-global-phone-spy-tool-patternz-nuviad-real-time-bidding/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.404media.co/inside-global-phone-spy-tool-patternz-nuviad-real-time-bidding/&quot;}" href="https://www.404media.co/inside-global-phone-spy-tool-patternz-nuviad-real-time-bidding/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">404 Media reported</a> on an Israeli surveillance company called Patternz, which was sourcing masses of location data through the RTB process.</p><p>In an exposed training video, Patternz showed some of the popular apps it got location data from: 9GAG, Kik, sports app FUTBIN, caller ID apps such as CallApp and Truecaller; and various word, sudoku, and solitaire puzzle games. Every one of these apps are also in the Gravy data. This suggests that Gravy, or wherever Gravy got that data from, also sourced it from interacting with the advertising system rather than location-tracking code baked into the apps.</p><p>404 Media shared some of the location data with another security researcher with knowledge of the advertising and location data industries. “It appears that at least some of this data would likely have been sourced from advertising related, real-time bidding,” Krzysztof Franaszek, founder of Adalytics, a digital forensics firm, told 404 Media after reviewing the data. He pointed out some of the user-agents in the file, which show how a user’s device connected to a service, referenced “afma-sdk.” That is a string <a href="https://ads-developers.googleblog.com/2022/07/use-new-google-mobile-ads-sdk.html">used by Google’s Mobile Ads SDK</a> (software development kit). In other words, in some cases, it is Google’s advertising platform that is delivering the ads that are eventually leading to this tracking by outside companies and potentially government contractors.</p><p>Google did not respond to multiple requests for comment for this article.

<p>If you asked someone what they wanted from <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/12/buying-a-tv-in-2025-expect-lower-prices-more-ads-and-an-os-war/">TVs released in 2025</a>, I doubt they'd say "more software and AI." Yet, if you look at what TV companies have planned for this year, which is being primarily promoted at the CES technology trade show in Las Vegas this week, software and AI are where much of the focus is.</p>
<p>The trend reveals the implications of TV brands increasingly viewing themselves as software rather than hardware companies, with their products being customer data rather than TV sets. This points to an alarming future for smart TVs, where even premium models sought after for top-end image quality and hardware capabilities are stuffed with unwanted gimmicks.</p>
<h2>LG’s remote regression</h2>
<p>LG has long made some of the best—and most expensive—TVs available. Its OLED lineup, in particular, has appealed to people who use their TVs to watch Blu-rays, enjoy HDR, and the like. However, some features that LG is introducing to high-end TVs this year seem to better serve LG’s business interests than those users' needs.</p>
<p>Take the new remote. Formerly known as the Magic Remote, LG is calling the 2025 edition the AI Remote. That is already likely to dissuade people who are skeptical about AI marketing in products (<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19368623.2024.2368040">research suggests</a> there are many such people). But the more immediately frustrating part is that the new remote doesn’t have a dedicated button for switching input modes, as previous remotes from LG and countless other remotes do.</p>

      LG's AI Remote.

<p>To use the AI Remote to change the TV’s input—a common task for people using their sets to play video games, watch Blu-rays or DVDs, connect their PC, et cetera—you have to long-press the Home Hub button. Single-pressing that button brings up a dashboard of webOS (the operating system for LG TVs) apps. That functionality isn't immediately apparent to someone picking up the remote for the first time and detracts from the remote’s convenience.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>By overlooking other obviously helpful controls (play/pause, fast forward/rewind, and numbers) while including buttons dedicated to things like LG's free ad-supported streaming TV (FAST) channels and Amazon Alexa, LG missed an opportunity to update its remote in a way centered on how people frequently use TVs. That said, it feels like user convenience didn't drive this change. Instead, LG seems more focused on getting people to use webOS apps. LG can monetize app usage through, i.e., getting a cut of streaming subscription sign-ups, selling <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/09/lg-tvs-continue-down-advertising-rabbit-hole-with-new-screensaver-ads/">ads on webOS</a>, and selling and<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/10/streaming-industry-has-unprecedented-surveillance-manipulation-capabilities/">&nbsp;leveraging user data</a>.</p>
<h2>Moving from hardware provider to software platform</h2>
<p>LG, like many other TV OEMs, has been growing its ads and data business. Deals with data analytics firms like Nielsen give it more incentive to acquire customer data. Declining TV margins and rock-bottom prices from budget brands (like Vizio and Roku, which sometimes lose money on TV hardware sales and make up for the losses through ad sales and data collection) are also pushing LG's software focus. In the case of the AI Remote, software prioritization comes at the cost of an oft-used hardware capability.</p>
<p>Further demonstrating its motives, in September 2023, LG announced intentions to "become a media and entertainment platform company" by offering "services" and a "collection of curated content in products, including LG OLED and LG QNED TVs." At the time, the South Korean firm said it would invest 1 trillion KRW (about $737.7 million) into its webOS business through 2028.</p>
<p>Low TV margins, improved TV durability, market saturation, and broader economic challenges are all serious challenges for an electronics company like LG and have pushed LG to explore alternative ways to make money off of TVs. However, after paying four figures for TV sets, LG customers shouldn't be further burdened to help LG accrue revenue.</p>

<h2>Google TVs gear up for subscription-based features</h2>
<p>There are numerous TV manufacturers, including Sony, TCL, and Philips, relying on Google software to power their TV sets. Numerous TVs announced at CES 2025 will come with what Google calls Gemini Enhanced Google Assistant. The idea that this is something that people using Google TVs have requested is somewhat contradicted by Google Assistant interactions with TVs thus far being “somewhat limited,” per a <a href="https://www.lowpass.cc/p/google-tv-far-field-microphones-ces-gemini">Lowpass</a> report.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, these TVs are adding far-field microphones so that they can hear commands directed at the voice assistant. For the first time, the voice assistant will include Google’s generative AI chatbot, Gemini, this year—another feature that TV users don’t typically ask for. Despite the lack of demand and the privacy concerns associated with microphones that can pick up audio from far away even when the TV is off, companies are still loading 2025 TVs with far-field mics to support Gemini. Notably, these TVs will likely allow the mics to be disabled, like you can with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/09/amazons-self-branded-tvs-get-fancier-with-quantum-dots-local-dimming/">other TVs using far-field mics.</a> But I still ponder about features/hardware that could have been implemented instead.</p>
<p>Google is also working toward having people pay a subscription fee to use Gemini on their TVs, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2568513/google-hopes-youll-pay-for-an-ai-tv-assistant-someday.html">PCWorld</a> reported.</p>
<p>“For us, our biggest goal is to create enough value that yes, you would be willing to pay for [Gemini],” Google TV VP and GM Shalini Govil-Pai told the publication.</p>
<p>The executive pointed to future capabilities for the Gemini-driven Google Assistant on TVs, including asking it to “suggest a movie like <em>Jurassic Park </em>but suitable for young children” or to show “Bollywood movies that are similar to <em>Mission: Impossible</em>.”</p>
<p>She also pointed to future features like showing weather, top news stories, and upcoming calendar events when someone is near the TV, showing AI-generated news briefings, and the ability to respond to questions like “explain the solar system to a third-grader” with text, audio, and YouTube videos.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>But when people have desktops, laptops, tablets, and phones in their homes already, how helpful are these features truly? Govil-Pai admitted to PCWorld that “people are not used to” using their TVs this way “so it will take some time for them to adapt to it.” With this in mind, it seems odd for TV companies to implement new, more powerful microphones to support features that Google acknowledges aren't in demand. I’m not saying that tech companies shouldn’t get ahead of the curve and offer groundbreaking features that users hadn’t considered might benefit them. But already planning to monetize those capabilities—with a subscription, no less—suggests a prioritization of corporate needs.</p>
<h2>Samsung is hungry for AI</h2>
<p>People who want to use their TV for cooking inspiration often turn to cooking shows or online cooking videos. However, Samsung wants people to use its TV software to identify dishes they want to try making.</p>
<p>During CES, Samsung announced Samsung Food for TVs. The feature leverages Samsung TVs’ AI processors to identify food displayed on the screen and recommend relevant recipes. Samsung introduced the capability in 2023 as an iOS and Android app after buying the app Whisk in 2019. As noted by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/05/samsungs-new-tvs-can-find-recipes-for-dishes-in-shows/">TechCrunch</a>, though, <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/ai/i-gave-claude-chatgpt-and-gemini-a-photo-of-some-ingredients-to-see-which-came-up-with-the-best-recipe-heres-the-results">other AI tools</a> for providing recipes based on food images <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/tired-of-eating-out-i-tried-this-recipe-generating-ai-tool-to-create-a-restaurant-meal-at-home/">are flawed</a>.</p>
<p>So why bother with such a feature? You can get a taste of Samsung’s motivation from its CES-announced deal with Instacart that lets people order off Instacart from Samsung smart fridges that support the capability. Samsung Food on TVs can show users the progress of food orders placed via the Samsung Food mobile app on their TVs. Samsung Food can also create a shopping list for recipe ingredients based on what it knows (using cameras and AI) is in your (supporting) Samsung fridge. The feature also requires a Samsung account, which allows the company to gather more information on users.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Other software-centric features loaded into Samsung TVs this year include a dedicated AI button on the new TVs’ remotes, the ability to use gestures to control the TV but only if you’re wearing a Samsung Galaxy Watch, and AI Karaoke, which lets people sing karaoke using their TVs by stripping vocals from music playing and using their phone as a mic.</p>
<p>Like LG, Samsung has shown growing interest in ads and data collection. In May, for example, it expanded its automatic content recognition tech to track ad exposure on streaming services viewed on its TVs. It also has an ads analytics partnership with Experian.</p>

<h2>Large language models on TVs</h2>
<p>TVs are mainstream technology in most US homes. Generative AI chatbots, on the other hand, are emerging technology that many people have yet to try. Despite these disparities, LG and Samsung are incorporating Microsoft’s Copilot chatbot into 2025 TVs.</p>
<p>LG claims that Copilot will help its TVs “understand conversational context and uncover subtle user intentions,” adding: “Access to Microsoft Copilot further streamlines the process, allowing users to efficiently find and organize complex information using contextual cues. For an even smoother and more engaging experience, the AI chatbot proactively identifies potential user challenges and offers timely, effective solutions.”</p>
<p>Similarly, Samsung, which is also adding Copilot to some of its smart monitors, said in its announcement that Copilot will help with “personalized content recommendations.” Samsung has also said that Copilot will help its TVs understand strings of commands, like increasing the volume and changing the channel, <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/home-entertainment/samsungs-2025-tvs-get-all-the-ai-extras-nobody-asked-for/">CNET</a> noted. Samsung said it intends to work with additional AI partners, namely Google, but it's unclear why it needs multiple AI partners, especially when it hasn’t yet seen how people use large language models on their TVs.</p>

        <div>
          
          
<h2>TV-as-a-platform</h2>
<p>To be clear, this isn't a condemnation against new, unexpected TV features. This also isn't a censure against new TV apps or the usage of AI in TVs.</p>
<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/04/ai-marketing-hype-is-coming-for-your-favorite-gadgets/">AI marketing hype </a>is real and misleading regarding the demand, benefits, and possibilities of AI in consumer gadgets. However, there are some cases when innovative software, including AI, can improve things that TV users not only care about but actually want or need. For example, some TVs use AI for things like trying to optimize sound, color, and/or brightness, including based on current environmental conditions or upscaling. This week, Samsung announced AI Live Translate for TVs. The feature is supposed to be able to translate foreign language closed captions in real time, providing a way for people to watch more international content. It's a feature I didn't ask for but can see being useful and changing how I use my TV.</p>
<p>But a lot of this week's TV announcements underscore an alarming TV-as-a-platform trend where TV sets are sold as a way to infiltrate people's homes so that apps, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/12/tcl-tvs-will-use-films-made-with-generative-ai-to-push-targeted-ads/">AI</a>, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/11/an-ad-giant-wants-to-control-your-next-tvs-operating-system/">ads</a> can be pushed onto viewers. Even high-end TVs are moving in this direction and amplifying features with questionable usefulness, effectiveness, and privacy considerations. Again, I can't help but wonder what better innovations could have come out this year if more R&amp;D was directed toward hardware and other improvements that are more immediately rewarding for users than karaoke with AI.</p>
<p>The TV industry is facing economic challenges, and, understandably, TV brands are seeking creative solutions for making money. But for consumers, that means paying for features that you’re likely to ignore. Ultimately, many people just want a TV with amazing image and sound quality. Finding that without having to sift through a bunch of fluff is getting harder.</p>

        <p>For a lot of us, soldering just seems to come naturally. But if we’re being honest, none of us was born with a soldering iron in our hand — ouch! — and if we’re good at soldering now, it’s only thanks to good habits and long practice. But what if you’re a company that lives and dies by the quality of the solder joints your employees produce? How do you get them to embrace the dark art of soldering?</p>
<p>If you’re Tektronix in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the answer is simple: make <a href="https://youtu.be/yZSveVpgmIM" target="_blank">in-depth training videos that teach people to solder the Tek way</a>. The first video below, from 1977, is aimed at workers on the assembly line and as such concentrates mainly on the practical aspects of making solid solder joints on PCBs and mainly with through-hole components. The video does have a bit of theory on soldering chemistry and the difference between eutectic alloys and other tin-lead mixes, as well as a little about the proper use of silver-bearing solders. But most of the time is spent discussing the primary tool of the trade: the iron. Even though the film is dated and looks like a multi-generation dupe from VHS, it still has a lot of valuable tips; we’ve been soldering for decades and somehow never realized that cleaning a tip on a wet sponge is so effective because the sudden temperature change helps release oxides and burned flux. The more you know.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/jMchFqu3Jx0" target="_blank">The second video below</a> is aimed more at the Tek repair and rework technicians. It reiterates a lot of the material from the first video, but then veers off into repair-specific topics, like effective desoldering. Pro tip: Don’t use the “Heat and Shake” method of desoldering, and wear those safety glasses. There’s also a lot of detail on how to avoid damaging the PCB during repairs, and how to fix them if you do manage to lift a trace. They put a fair amount of emphasis on the importance of making repairs look good, especially with bodge wires, which should be placed on the back of the board so they’re not so obvious. It makes sense; Tek boards from the era are works of art, and you don’t want to mess with that.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main">
<article>

<div dir="auto">
<p>This post is about finally finding a book from one’s youth forty years later – and after nearly thirty years of searching.</p>
<p>It is also a tale about goblins and Christmas decorations; about the perils of ChatGPT and Artificial Intelligence; and about the real value of librarians, cataloguers, indexers, and archivists – what should be called the Noble Professions.</p>
<p>And it is an account that ends with not one but two wonderful events.</p>
<p>So if you are sitting comfortably, with a suitable seasonal drink, we will start with a bit of background and with a historical excursion.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Once upon a time there was a story.</p>
<p>And the story was in a book – a child’s anthology: the sort of book that one used to get in school bookshops and advertised in the special catalogues that were common in English schools (and elsewhere) in the 1970s and 1980s.</p>
<p>All the books I had at the time got lost – house moves and so on – and since the world wide web made searching for second-hand books easy I have replaced the books one-by-one.</p>
<p>When you re-read such books, sometimes what one thinks are one’s own original ideas and expressions stare back at you and you realise where you got them from.</p>
<p>What the economist J. M. Keynes once said –&nbsp;<em>“Practical men who believe themselves to be quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist”</em>&nbsp;– has a far wider application.</p>
<p>Many of us are the slaves of what we read when very young.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>But there was one book what eluded me, every time it was searched for.</p>
<p>What I could remember (or believed I could remember) was as follows:</p>
<p>– it was a story in an anthology;</p>
<p>– the story was about what will happen if you do not take your decorations down by Twelfth Night – for goblins and other ne’er-do-wells will go through your town and hide behind any remaining decorations and cause you mischief all year round;</p>
<p>– but there was a cure to this mischief if a certain thing was done on Candlemas – 2 February – and this was because of an esoteric rule which could be applied surreptitiously by those with special knowledge;</p>
<p>– the book was purple;</p>
<p>– the title or sub-title of the book, or of the story, was <em>“from Michelmas to Candlemas”&nbsp;</em>– the use of “<em>Candlemas</em>” was obvious from the story, and the&nbsp;<em>“Michaelmas”</em>&nbsp;I was certain about because it was a word I would again encounter in my late teens as a student, as it reminded me of the story/book.</p>
<p>(One of these memories, however, was false and another only semi-reliable.)</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>The story was important to me because it led to my passion for lore.</p>
<p>For me as a legal commentator, law (in its technical, black-letter sense) is practically far less important than what people – including lawyers and even judges – believe the law to be.</p>
<p>(Long-term followers may also recall my original blogging name was of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_o%27_Kent" rel="">a folklore hero</a>&nbsp;who bested the devil by careful attention to what was actually agreed.)</p>
<p>And so this remembered Candlemas story had everything for a lover of lore and law: a predicament, an obscure rule, the skilled application of that rule, and a remedy.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>How I searched for this story – usually every year in November or December.</p>
<p>At first, I searched the web generally – with text and then, as Google developed, for the book cover.</p>
<p>I searched sites which had pictures of the book catalogues of the time.</p>
<p>I searched the British Library, the Bodleian Library, and every library I could think of.</p>
<p>Nil-return.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>It was a mini-exercise&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2TilNclT8k" rel="">in being J. R. Hartley</a>&nbsp;year after year.</p>
<p>After a while certain results became familiar – and I probably know more about <a href="https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=187175ea13837ba9&amp;sxsrf=ADLYWIIVO6N79MGGuSSGU9PrVvM2PfL4mQ:1734603763244&amp;q=Candlemas+books+devotional&amp;udm=2&amp;fbs=AEQNm0Aa4sjWe7Rqy32pFwRj0UkWde_MVagR57NIrd96T8bhwqEHeQ8jxei7F1s0aV23iWdi741Y3wNj5M6YQHR2X6laQ2bG_-lQAEb0rBAh8HRP8QnwCon_R8sFRzqEefr32Ob9swxFwdMawgPopA8MJ3jT9WeCgU-iUIUXZtKdtqKHtMWi_SZ41t31ikJ6wkUr5mZT0z82cmGy5mWpAaSfdIqbKHiMSw&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj6ionJzrOKAxUcWkEAHS_TK8IQtKgLegQIFhAB&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=958&amp;dpr=1" rel="">devotional texts about</a>&nbsp;– and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Candlemas+adventure+stories&amp;sca_esv=187175ea13837ba9&amp;udm=2&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=958&amp;sxsrf=ADLYWIKkKlYh0g7MhfVOIAghQnYkSQZRFg%3A1734603765270&amp;ei=9fNjZ8ObEJ6VhbIPsMWz6QE&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiD6oTKzrOKAxWeSkEAHbDiLB0Q4dUDCBE&amp;uact=5&amp;oq=Candlemas+adventure+stories&amp;gs_lp=EgNpbWciG0NhbmRsZW1hcyBhZHZlbnR1cmUgc3Rvcmllc0j2LVDqBFiKLHABeACQAQCYAUGgAfAJqgECMjS4AQPIAQD4AQGYAgmgAoAEwgIEECMYJ8ICBBAAGB7CAgYQABgIGB7CAgUQABiABJgDAIgGAZIHATmgB_Iq&amp;sclient=img" rel="">adventure stories set</a>&nbsp;at – Candlemas than many other people.</p>
<p>And it was always a pleasure to renew contact with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.british-history.ac.uk/letters-papers-hen8/vol10/pp1-12" rel="">texts like</a>&nbsp;<em>“[i]t is a very old enactment that no Gascon wines or Toulouse woad be brought into England in strange bottoms, and nothing which has been done affects them but was devised to restrain the folly of English merchants who ventured to Bordeaux at unseasonable times, and the restraint&nbsp;<strong>from Michaelmas to Candlemas</strong>, by avoiding dangerous times, will rather augment the traffic…” (emphasis added.)</em></p>
<p>I bought books of Christmas stories on the off-chance they would reprint the story I was looking for – a disconcerting number of which appear to have been edited by Gyles Brandreth.</p>
<p>Nil-return.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>When social media came along, I would then appeal from time-to-time for any information.</p>
<p>Those who responded were often very helpful – and so yet more Christmas anthologies were bought, and further lines of enquiry followed.</p>
<p>I made direct contact with experts in folklore and fairy tales, but they were as non-plussed as me.</p>
<p>Still nil-return.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Along the way though, I found out a great deal about the lores of the twelve days of Christmas and Candlemas which contextualised what I could remember.</p>
<p>For example, both Twelfth Night and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candlemas" rel="">Candlemas</a>&nbsp;have historically been the ends of the Christmas period – the latter being the fortieth day after Christmas.</p>
<p>And I discovered that Candlemas – which is also marked the purification (or what became known in England as ‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churching_of_women" rel="">churching</a>’) of Mary and the presentation of Jesus at the Temple – was once an annual event that was very important in English culture.</p>
<p>Indeed Charles I arranged&nbsp;<a href="https://historyofparliament.com/2023/05/11/1626-coronation-charles-i/" rel="">his coronation to be held on Candlemas</a>.</p>
<p>And royalists made a point of celebrating Candlemas as part of what we would now call&nbsp;<em>“culture wars”</em>&nbsp;of the 1600s.</p>
<p>One once-famous poet, the loyalist clergyman&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Herrick_(poet)" rel="">Robert Herrick</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://gutenberg.org/cache/epub/22421/pg22421-images.html#id_2.p892" rel="">published three poems</a>&nbsp;about Candlemas, one of which urged the burning of decorations on that day, else bad things would follow:</p>
<p><em>Kindle the Christmas brand, and then</em></p>
<p><em>Till sunset let it burn;</em></p>
<p><em>Which quench’d, then lay it up again</em></p>
<p><em>Till Christmas next return.</em></p>
<p><em>Part must be kept wherewith to teend</em></p>
<p><em>The Christmas log next year,</em></p>
<p><em>And where ’tis safely kept, the fiend</em></p>
<p><em>Can do no mischief there.</em></p>
<p>(This ritual burning of decorations is a tradition that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/columnists/article-12930745/BORIS-JOHNSON-burn-Christmas-tree.html" rel="">still has echoes today</a>.)</p>
<p>After the culture wars of the 1600s, however, Candlemas became less popular – and soon it was all-but forgotten culturally, outside the annual blessing of candles at certain churches.</p>
<p>(On Candlemas in particular, see chapter 13 of&nbsp;<em>The Stations of the Sun</em>&nbsp;by Ronald Hutton, and on the place of Candlemas in the politics and religion of early modern England generally, see Eamon Duffy’s&nbsp;<em>The Stripping of the Altars: Traditional Religion in England, 1400-1580</em>.)</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>This was all fascinating, but it was not getting me any closer to the book or the story.</p>
<p>A couple of years ago, after the usual social media appeal, someone suggested I try the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsthatbook/" rel="">r/whatsthatbook</a>&nbsp;thread on Reddit, where very clever and generous people spend time trying to identify books from the scantiest of details.</p>
<p>So&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsthatbook/comments/zdbnk3/book_with_candlemas_story/" rel="">I did</a>.</p>
<p>And someone there corresponded with a suggestion which actually covered each of the data points I could recall about the book – and it had the right title, and the book even had a well-known editor.</p>
<p>This was an extraordinary find – how could I have missed this in all the years of searching?</p>
<p>Well.</p>
<p>The reason it had never been uncovered before was because the impressive looking account had been generated – entirely fabricated – by ChatGPT.</p>
<p>This false account has now been deleted, but the correspondent remarked when I said this looked like it had been auto-generated:&nbsp;<em>“You’re right, I’ve tried chatGPT on some descriptions around here and it worked pretty well. However sometimes it has a propensity to spew random bullshit. I forgot because it’s so good in other areas. I’ll check better.”</em></p>
<p>I had never come across ChatGPT before – and so I have distrusted it ever since.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>So this year – a couple of weeks ago – I did the annual appeal – but this time on BlueSky and Mastodon, and not on Twitter.</p>
<p>And yet again, people were helpful – anthologies were suggested and bought (though no further ones by Gyles Brandreth).</p>
<p>Someone again used ChatGPT, and they came up with:</p>
<p><em>“The book you’re describing sounds like “From Michaelmas to Candlemas” by Ruth Ainsworth. It was published in the 1970s and features seasonal stories aimed at children, including the one about the need to take down Christmas decorations by Candlemas to avoid goblins hiding behind them. The title references the traditional English calendar, marking the time from the feast of Michaelmas (September 29) to Candlemas (February 2). The story you mentioned aligns with themes found in folklore and poetry, including those by Robert Herrick. If this is the book you’re thinking of, it was indeed popular in school book clubs during that era.”</em></p>
<p>Again, like the account offered by the Reddit correspondent, this passage looks authoritative and plausible.</p>
<p>You will even notice how it neatly covers everything I could remember – giving equal weight to each data point and deftly joining them all together.</p>
<p>And again, what ChatGPT here had to offer was utterly – absolutely – false.</p>
<p>Like a fluent and practised (but unwise) liar it had contrived an account that fitted only the available information.</p>
<p>It was fake.</p>
<p>This year looked like another nil-return.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>And then, something remarkable happened.</p>
<p>The appeal got&nbsp;<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/tambourine.bsky.social/post/3lc25w54a3k2k" rel="">this response</a>:</p>

<p>Wow.</p>
<p>It was the same story, now looking up at me from a computer screen forty years later.</p>
<p>I remember the stylised first letter, the imagery, the pacing, the tone.</p>
<p>It did mention goblins as part of the ne’er-do-wells, but it was about a demon – not a goblin – who hid behind a sprig of holly.</p>
<p>(My insistence that it was a goblin was a semi-unreliable memory.)</p>
<p>And there was (who I now know was) Granny Hawkins being the holder of the all-important esoteric knowledge.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>What had happened was this: Charlotte was far from a ChatGPT bot but instead a trained and experienced librarian.</p>
<p>(You can and should&nbsp;<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/tambourine.bsky.social" rel="">follow her here</a>&nbsp;– she is a genius and a treasure, and she has found other odd things out for other people.)</p>
<p>She sensibly assumed some of the things I could recall would have more weight – be more reliable – than others.</p>
<p>(The&nbsp;<em>“Michaelmas”</em>&nbsp;was, it turned out, a false memory – and this had undermined my searches.)</p>
<p>She then used various permutations of my memory points until she found a match, and she then found a book which someone had scanned onto internet archive.</p>
<p>You can see the book <a href="https://archive.org/details/ghostsshadows0000unse" rel="">here</a>.</p>
<p>The details there found could then be cross-referenced against&nbsp;<a href="http://philsp.com/" rel="">this truly amazing catalogue of fantasy short stories</a>&nbsp;-and it was indeed in an anthology – alongside the Herrick poem!</p>

<p>The story had been found – because of a librarian using critical skills (and thereby not giving equal weight to each factor), an archive, and a catalogue/index.</p>
<p>Verily: librarians, archivists, cataloguers, and indexers are the Noble Professions.</p>
<p>For they organise information in a manner in which humans actually think – unlike ChatGPT and Artificial Intelligence.</p>
<p>They are the holders of the old knowledge and skills.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>So here is the book:</p>

<p>My initial reaction was that Charlotte had certainly uncovered the same story – but it was perhaps in a different edition.</p>
<p>The cover of what Charlotte had found was black – and I distinctly remembered the book being purple.</p>
<p>Nonetheless I ordered the book online – so I could read all the story again in physical form (I refused to read it on the archive – I could wait one more week after so many years).</p>
<p>And when the book arrived I noticed something.</p>
<p>The back of the book was purple.</p>

<p>Never judge a book by its front cover.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Before we come to the second wonderful event of this book-quest, here is the story of&nbsp;<em>“Twelfth Night Till Candlemas”</em>&nbsp;in full.</p>
<p>Note as you read how the old knowledge is used and the necessary rule are applied – and how the vicar ensures that a suppressed, secret ceremony can take place – there seems to be a great deal of cultural and religious knowledge behind this simple-looking children’s story.</p>

<p><em>‘I’m just off to the pond. I shall dive to the bottom and cover myself with mud and stay there. That is the only proper way to spend the winter,’ said Frog, and he hopped away.</em></p>
<p>*</p>
<p>I can also recommend the story about old Mother Merriweather in her&nbsp;<em>Cuckoo Fair</em>&nbsp;story, which deals with summer, in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.amazon.co.za/Mists-Magic-Dorothy-Edwards/dp/0718825373" rel="">this other Dorothy Edwards anthology</a>.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>A bit more research showed that Ruth C. Paine had contributed&nbsp;<a href="https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/schedules/service_bbc_radio_fourfm/1971-07-09" rel="">a story for broadcast for&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/schedules/service_bbc_radio_fourfm/1971-07-09" rel="">Listen with Mother</a></em>&nbsp;(thank you to the kind person who put the&nbsp;<em>Radio Times</em>&nbsp;listings archive online).</p>
<p>But otherwise it was really not surprising that an author from the 1970s and 1980s had so little online trace.</p>
<p>It crossed my mind that Ruth C. Paine could be a pseudonym of Dorothy Edwards – such things are not uncommon with busy editors who need to fill spaces in books and broadcasts.</p>
<p>Yet there was something about the distinctive depth of knowledge behind the Candlemas story which made it unlikely to be a throwaway pseudonym of someone else. And Dorothy Edwards often included her own stories in her anthologies.</p>
<p>Anyway, no matter: I had the book and the story.</p>
<p>That is where I thought this story would end.</p>

<p>And then the second remarkable event occurred.</p>
<p>Charlotte and I got&nbsp;<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/vickymackenzie.bsky.social/post/3lclu2ovlpc2h" rel="">this reply</a>&nbsp;from the novelist&nbsp;<a href="https://victoriamackenzie.net/" rel="">Victoria MacKenzie</a>:</p>

<p>And so Ruth C. Paine certainly did exist – and, as the Candlemas story indicated, she did have an extensive knowledge of religion and cultural history.</p>
<p>Her great niece has now kindly provided the following fascinating details:</p>
<p><em>“Ruth Cecilia Paine was my great aunt – my grandfather’s twin sister – and although she passed away in 2001, when I was just twenty-one, she was a big influence on my life. We wrote to each other regularly (I still remember her postcode, all these years later) and she was very encouraging to me about my education; at the start of each school year she sent me a little money for stationery, which I found incredibly exciting!</em></p>
<p><em>“I always knew that she had written stories for children, but that only a handful had been published – mostly in anthologies edited by Dorothy Edwards. As far as I knew, writing was a hobby, but I sensed it was one that meant a great deal to her. She often sent me books as gifts and occasionally I visited her in her flat in Canterbury where she lived with her lifelong companion, Lillian.</em></p>
<p><em>“She was a Christian and a church-goer all her life, latterly giving tours of Canterbury Cathedral. My dad told me that she’d been a missionary in India earlier in her life and I seem to half-remember a story she told me of travelling through a monsoon in a small aeroplane – understandably a terrifying experience!</em></p>
<p><em>“When she returned to in Britain she became a Religious Studies teacher, and her last job was at Hastings High School, before her retirement around the time I was born in 1980. Apparently she was regarded as quite formidable by my dad’s generation, but she was always very kind to me. I wish so much that she could have known her great niece would become a writer!”</em></p>
<p>*</p>
<p>The formidable Ruth C. Paine had indeed been a former missionary in her youth – Birmingham University records attest this.</p>
<p>This is Ruth Cecilia Paine in her teaching days:</p>

<p><em>“Of course!”</em>&nbsp;said Granny Hawkins.</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>In a matter of days I has gone from the ritual despair of an annual fruitless, futile search, to not only having the story and the book – but to also seeing the actual manuscript of the story I had spent forty years thinking about and about thirty years searching for.</p>
<p>This was a wonderful, extraordinary turn-of-events.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Two things can perhaps be said by way of a conclusion to this story.</p>
<p>The first is that we should be wary of the mischievous demons of our own age – that is ChatGPT and Artificial Intelligence – and to renew our trust in the Noble Professions who hold the old knowledge and skills: librarians, archivists, cataloguers, and indexers.</p>
<p>The second is that nowadays the real problem perhaps is not with Christmas decorations staying up too late, but with them going up too early, and with shops selling Christmas wares and playing Christmas music well before Advent, let alone Christmas.</p>
<p>We need new cautionary tales about when such things should be done and not done.</p>
<p>We are going to need some new goblins.</p>
<p>*******</p>
<p>I am very grateful to the heirs and holders of the literary estate of Ruth C. Paine for their kind permission for me to publish&nbsp;<em>“Twelfth Night Till Candlemas”</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>“How Nip spent the winter”</em>.</p>
<p>Editors would do well to contact Vicky MacKenzie to arrange permission to put her great aunt’s stories in new anthologies.</p>
<p>I am also grateful to Vicky MacKenzie for her kind permission to publish the unpublished corrected manuscript of&nbsp;<em>“Twelfth Night Till Candlemas”&nbsp;</em>and the unpublished photograph of her aunt..</p>
<p>Many thanks to Charlotte who not only found the story, but dealt with many follow-on queries.</p>
<p>Many thanks also to my friends who listened to previous versions of this post.</p>
<p>This post is dedicated to one of these friends, Nick, who is currently dealing with a challenging time – and who has also listened to me go on about story-telling for over thirty years. Poor sod.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="link_wrapped_content">




<p>Ten years ago PC gamers were eagerly awaiting <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/423974/steam-machines-unleashed-impressions-from-one-week-in-a-steam-powered-living-room.html">Steam Machines</a>, console-style Linux boxes built from the ground up to play PC games. They flopped, due in no small part to Steam operator Valve’s lack of experience working with hardware partners. But in 2025, both Valve and its home-built gaming operating system are different beasts. And Microsoft should be afraid of them. </p>



<p><strong>Further reading: </strong><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1981383/how-to-use-steam-deck-as-a-desktop-pc.html">How to use Steam Deck as a desktop PC</a></p>



<h2 id="the-steam-deck-dominates-pc-gaming">The Steam Deck dominates PC gaming</h2>



<p>The big story in PC gaming for the last three years has been the Steam Deck. This low-power, portable, relatively inexpensive machine is clearly something the market has been waiting for, exciting gamers and energizing PC makers to pump out imitators, like the Asus ROG Ally and the Lenovo Legion Go. </p>



<p>But all of these machines lack a crucial component, despite copying the Steam Deck’s hardware to a greater or lesser degree. They rely on Windows, as do almost all consumer PCs not made by Apple. And <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2229777/why-lenovos-legion-go-isnt-my-go-to-handheld.html">Windows just isn’t a good experience</a> in this form factor.</p>

		
			
			


<p>That’s why Lenovo turned to Valve for its second-gen Legion Go S. Or perhaps more precisely, the Legion Go S Powered By SteamOS (its full and cumbersome title). It’s <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2567576/lenovo-legion-go-s-is-the-first-non-valve-steamos-gaming-handheld.html">the first handheld PC officially powered by Valve’s Linux-based operating system</a>, but probably not the last. </p>



<p>Lenovo is also making new Windows-based versions of the same hardware, but we’ve already heard that Asus is working on a similar Steam-powered handheld, and Valve itself will <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338405/valve-steamos-beta-other-handhelds-beyond-steam-deck&amp;xcust=2-1-2571541-1-0-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/article/2571541/microsoft-should-be-terrified-of-steamos.html" rel="nofollow" data-subtag="2-1-2571541-1-0-0-0-0" data-domain-name="theverge" target="_blank">let you download and install builds of SteamOS later in 2025</a>. Some tech heads aren’t even waiting, and are already <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2480004/run-steamos-on-your-desktop-pc-or-gaming-handheld-with-bazzite.html">building their own quasi-SteamOS-powered PCs</a>.</p>


<div><figure data-wp-context="{&quot;uploadedSrc&quot;:false,&quot;figureClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;,&quot;figureStyles&quot;:null,&quot;imgClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-image-2567614&quot;,&quot;imgStyles&quot;:null,&quot;targetWidth&quot;:&quot;none&quot;,&quot;targetHeight&quot;:&quot;none&quot;,&quot;scaleAttr&quot;:false,&quot;ariaLabel&quot;:&quot;Enlarge image: legion go S steam &quot;,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;legion go S steam &quot;}" data-wp-interactive="core/image"><img decoding="async" data-wp-init="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-async--click="actions.showLightbox" data-wp-on-async--load="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-async-window--resize="callbacks.setButtonStyles" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/legion-go-S-steam.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" alt="legion go S steam " width="1200" height="675" loading="lazy"></figure><p>Lenovo/Valve</p></div>



<p>Despite fumbling its initial debut on console-style Steam Machines, SteamOS has quietly and steadily improved over the last decade, benefitting both from the Linux market’s maturity and Valve’s endless investment into the Steam store and community as a quasi-platform of its own. </p>



<p>The X factor in the Steam Deck’s explosive popularity is <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338405/valve-steamos-beta-other-handhelds-beyond-steam-deck&amp;xcust=2-1-2571541-1-0-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/article/2571541/microsoft-should-be-terrified-of-steamos.html" rel="nofollow" data-subtag="2-1-2571541-1-0-0-0-0" data-domain-name="theverge" target="_blank">the Proton compatibility layer</a>, which allows games made only for Windows to run on the low-powered AMD hardware with minimal fuss. It can’t run everything — non-Steam games like <em>Fortnite </em>and the latest AAA polygon-pushers can’t run optimally on the Steam Deck. But it’s good enough for the vast majority of PC games and on a device that starts at $400, you get a lot of grace from gamers who also need to pay for rent and groceries.</p>



<p>Contrast this with Windows, the current de facto standard for PC gaming. Yes, Linux fans, I know you’ve been playing some of the same games as Windows users for years, ditto for Mac. But when you think “gaming PC,” you think of a Windows-powered desktop or laptop. Or do you? It’s possible — though hard to pin down, since Valve hasn’t released any numbers — that in terms of single-device volume, the Steam Deck is now <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2519400/stop-waiting-for-an-xbox-handheld-and-just-buy-a-steam-deck.html">the most popular gaming PC in the world</a>. </p>



<h2 id="windows-wobbles-from-10-to-11">Windows wobbles from 10 to 11</h2>



<p>But I digress. Windows <em>is </em>the home of PC gaming, at least for now and the foreseeable future, but it’s not a happy home. As I said previously, handheld gaming PCs that ape the Steam Deck’s hardware but run Windows 11 often find that last point is the biggest pain point for users.</p>



<p>They complain of inefficient use of the limited hardware, to say nothing of how Windows just isn’t easy to use on those smaller screens. And companies like Asus, Lenovo, MSI, et cetera don’t have the software chops to make an effective go-between layer for users, even if these devices could spare the performance overhead (they can’t).</p>

<p>Windows isn’t looking so hot in general, in fact. The transition from Windows 10 to Windows 11 hasn’t quite been the disaster that the initial Windows 7 to 8 transition was. But it hasn’t been great, either. </p>



<p>Those big yearly updates seem to reliably bork at least some portion of the userbase’s machines, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2532669/ubisoft-games-are-crashing-on-pcs-with-the-windows-11-24h2-update.html">disproportionately affecting gamers</a> and Microsoft is still struggling to get people to give up Windows 10. Even with a well-publicized end of support coming in under a year, Windows 11 is struggling — and <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://www.theregister.com/2025/01/02/windows_10_grows/&amp;xcust=2-1-2571541-1-0-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/article/2571541/microsoft-should-be-terrified-of-steamos.html" rel="nofollow" data-subtag="2-1-2571541-1-0-0-0-0" data-domain-name="theregister" target="_blank">sometimes flat-out failing</a> — to gain market share over its previous incarnation.</p>



<p>Microsoft’s has larger general woes in the gaming market, <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://www.levelup.com/en/originals/799325/Xbox-Series-XS-is-a-disaster-and-Microsoft-caused-it/&amp;xcust=2-1-2571541-1-0-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/article/2571541/microsoft-should-be-terrified-of-steamos.html" rel="nofollow" data-subtag="2-1-2571541-1-0-0-0-0" data-domain-name="levelup" target="_blank">watching the Xbox platform and brand apparently drown</a> even as its Game Pass subscription grows. Game Pass is pretty clearly the company’s attempt at a cross-platform rebirth, the culmination of hundreds of billions invested in buying up developers and publishers to own games as diverse as <em>Minecraft, Call of Duty, </em>and <em>WoW. </em></p>



<p>But you can’t spend-money-to-make-money forever, and gaming isn’t Microsoft’s only business. It’s also desperate to sell Windows machines (2025 is “The year of the Windows 11 PC refresh,” <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2025/01/06/ces-2025-the-year-of-the-windows-11-pc-refresh/&amp;xcust=2-1-2571541-1-0-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/article/2571541/microsoft-should-be-terrified-of-steamos.html" rel="nofollow" data-subtag="2-1-2571541-1-0-0-0-0" data-domain-name="windows" target="_blank">allegedly</a>), Office subscriptions, and AI services to the enterprise. There might be too many cooks in the kitchen and too many mouths to feed, all at once, in one of the tech industry’s oldest and most reliable megacorps.</p>



<h2 id="steamos-reminds-me-of-android">SteamOS reminds me of Android</h2>



<p>So look at a wobbling Windows platform on one hand, and an ascendant and suddenly spreading SteamOS on the other. Valve has committed to offering SteamOS to manufacturing partners via the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2547938/valve-new-powered-by-steamos-branding-hints-at-new-hardware.html">“Powered by SteamOS” branding initiative</a>. </p>



<p>With the open source Linux as a foundation and relative hardware agnosticism, it’s starting to look a lot like the relationship that Google developed with smartphone makers to proliferate Android across the mobile market. It’s not a complete one-to-one comparison, but <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2570630/interview-valve-talks-steamos-on-third-party-handhelds.html">Valve told us in an interview</a> that it’s not charging for SteamOS. Huh.</p>



<p>Microsoft tried to compete with Android. It failed, miserably, and the company essentially had to abandon the mobile space entirely and settle for providing backend services through apps. Even when Microsoft tried to get an early foothold in the folding device segment with the Surface Duo (<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2483990/microsofts-surface-duo-2-gets-one-last-update-before-its-send-off.html">also failing</a>), it did so using Android as a basis. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Valve Lays Out Plans For SteamOS" width="500" height="281" src="" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UI-C-nZnDE8?feature=oembed"></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>My colleague Adam Patrick Murray waxed philosophical about SteamOS powering gaming laptops when he spoke with a Valve engineer at CES. And I think that’s a definite possibility, even if it isn’t Valve’s immediate focus with SteamOS as it moves to conquer the handheld form factor first. </p>



<p>But we’re talking about a “free” operating system (those quotes are because you’ll need to partner with Valve in some capacity to get the branding), built from the ground up for PC gaming, and flexible enough to run on some of the lowest-power hardware on the market or potentially the most cutting-edge gaming devices.</p>



<p>The parallels to Android are hard to ignore, at least for me, a journalist who cut my teeth on the smartphone boom. But the prospects don’t stop at gaming. With <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2500763/why-i-switched-from-windows-to-chromebooks-and-havent-looked-back.html">Chromebooks and ChromeOS</a>, Google has proven that regular consumers and even some bigger customers like education aren’t as committed to Windows as they were back in the 90s. </p>






<p>ChromeOS is still seen as a “budget” laptop solution (<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2525709/what-could-google-do-to-finally-make-a-winning-laptop.html">much to Google’s chagrin</a>). But a year or two from now, you could see Chrome-powered budget laptops next to mid-range and high-end SteamOS-powered gaming laptops, all sitting next to Windows 11 machines on a Best Buy shelf. And that’ll be <em>after </em>Microsoft has forced an upgrade upon lots of people who didn’t want to give up Windows 10. </p>



<h2 id="consumers-are-ready-for-a-future-beyond-windows">Consumers are ready for a future beyond Windows</h2>



<p>Let me be clear: The odds of a massive, immediate shift away from Windows PCs aren’t great. This isn’t a “year of the Linux desktop” rallying cry. But if there <em>is </em>a Linux desktop that exists today, it’s the Steam Deck. And that makes SteamOS a bellwether for greater proliferation of non-Windows devices (if not necessarily “Linux” specifically) in a huge range of form factors.</p>



<p>At the start of 2025, Microsoft still has its comfortable stranglehold on the consumer side of the PC market. It weathered “the death of the desktop” predicted during the smartphone and tablet boom — people aren’t getting rid of their personal machines. But Windows’ never-ending dominance as the de facto PC operating system is, if not in doubt, then certainly in question. </p>



<p>Microsoft’s attempts to ameliorate the issues that Windows-powered handheld PCs, lacking as they are, shows that the company is aware of the problem it has in that form factor. I wonder what it’ll do if it sees SteamOS jump to gaming laptops…or desktops. SteamOS isn’t necessarily a harbinger of doom for Windows. But it <em>could </em>be. And that should make Microsoft very, very frightened. </p>

My parents are of hardscrabble rural West Virginia and rural North Carolina origins. They barely managed to claw their way to the bottom of the middle class by the time they ended up in Virginia. Unfortunately, due to the demons passed on to them by their parents, my father was an alcoholic and my mother participated in the drinking. She ended up divorcing my father when I was 16 years old. It was only after the divorce that my parents were able to heal themselves, heal their only child, and stop the drinking, which was so destructive to our family. If the divorce hadn't forced the issue, alcohol would have inevitably destroyed us all. </p><p>My parents may not have done everything right, but they both unconditionally loved me. <strong>They taught me how to fully, deeply receive love, and the profound joy of reflecting that love upon everyone around you. </strong></p></div><p>I went on to attend public school in Chesterfield County, Virginia. In 1992 I graduated from the University of Virginia, founded by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson?ref=blog.codinghorror.com">Thomas Jefferson</a>.</p><p>During college, I worked at Safeway as a part-time cashier, earning the <a href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/minimum-wage/history?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">federal minimum wage</a>, scraping together whatever money I could through government Pell grants, scholarships, and other part-time work to pay my college tuition. Even with <a href="https://www.salliemae.com/blog/in-state-vs-out-of-state-tuition/?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">lower in-state tuition</a>, it was rocky. Sometimes I could barely manage tuition payments. And that was in 1992, when tuition was only $3,000 per year. It is now $23,000 per year. <a href="https://educationdata.org/average-cost-of-college-by-year?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">College tuition</a> at a state school increased by 8 times over the last 30 years.

But as I sat there in the audience among my neighbors, watching the complete story acted out in front of me by these teenagers, I slowly realized what staying gold actually meant: <a href="http://blog.asjournal.org/the-american-dream-reconsidered-the-outsiders-1967/?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer"><em>sharing</em> the American Dream</a>. </p><p>In the printed program, the director wrote:</p><blockquote>This play is a reminder that strength lies not just in overcoming hardships but in staying true to ourselves and lifting up those around us. <p>We hope you feel the raw emotions, sense the camaraderie, and <strong>connect with the enduring themes of resilience, empathy, and unity</strong>.

It is the foundation of our country, the second paragraph in our <a href="https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/declaration-transcript?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">Declaration of Independence</a>, written by the founder of the public university I attended:</p><blockquote>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.</blockquote><p>But the American Dream is not always available to every American. Its meaning can be distorted. Jimi Hendrix <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/rewinding-jimi-hendrixs-national-anthem?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">captured this distortion</a> so eloquently in his rendition of our national anthem. </p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sjzZh6-h9fM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Jimi Hendrix - The Star Spangled Banner [ National Anthem ] ( Live at Woodstock 1969 )"></iframe></figure><p>We are still trying to live up to those ideals today.

Our status as the <a href="https://thefulcrum.us/ethics-leadership/democracy-index?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">world's leading democracy</a> is in question.

<p>Here are some starting points for longer term efforts:</p><ul><li>We can support organizations making it easier for Americans to vote for a new Congress in two years and a new president in four years. My concern is damage to our democratic institutions may happen so quickly that our votes could matter even less within the coming years.</li><li>We could fund nonprofits that have a <a href="https://www.charitynavigator.org/about-us/our-methodology/ratings/?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">proven track record</a> of protecting democratic institutions.</li><li>We could found a new organization loosely based on the original <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAND_Corporation?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">RAND Corporation</a>, but modernized like <a href="https://www.leverforchange.org/?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">Lever for Change</a>. We can empower the best and brightest to determine a realistic, achievable path toward preserving the American Dream for <em>everyone,</em> working within the current system or outside it.</li><li>All states are shades of purple, not fully red or blue. We have <a href="https://today.yougov.com/politics/articles/50343-national-policy-proposals-with-bipartisan-support?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">more in common on specific policies</a> than we realize. It would be very difficult to draw borders if we split. I know what divorce feels like, and we don't want this.

Vote in your own city, county, and state elections. Support local independent journalism and media. Find a local organization doing work you admire, ask what they need, and help them meet those needs. Listen to the stories of fellow volunteers, listen to the stories of the people you’re serving – that is the heart of Democracy.</li></ul><p>We've already completed the eight $1 million donations <a href="#" rel="noreferrer">listed above</a> to help those most immediately in need. Within the next five years, half of our family wealth will support longer term efforts. There is no single solution, so let's work together.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><article itemprop="text"><p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Factorio Blueprint Visualizer</h2><a id="user-content-factorio-blueprint-visualizer" aria-label="Permalink: Factorio Blueprint Visualizer" href="#factorio-blueprint-visualizer"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">I love the game Factorio and I really like the look of factories after growing for many hours or blueprints after tweaking them for perfection. That's way I created a <a href="https://piebro.github.io/factorio-blueprint-visualizer/" rel="nofollow">website</a> to artfully visualize Factorio blueprints.</p>
<p dir="auto">
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/piebro/factorio-blueprint-visualizer/blob/master/examples/Rocket_Ship_1.jpg"><img src="https://github.com/piebro/factorio-blueprint-visualizer/raw/master/examples/Rocket_Ship_1.jpg" width="58%"></a>

</p>
<p dir="auto">With the website you can import Factorio blueprints as text and visualize them. You can tweak the drawing settings or create random ones.</p>
<p dir="auto">All buildings and tiles with their bounding boxes and belt, pipe, rail, inserter, wire and electricity connections can be visualized. Everything is drawn in vector graphics (SVG) to be able to view it in any resolution.</p>
<p dir="auto">With the latest update, Blueprints from Factorio before version 2.0 might not work correctly. You can import older blueprints to factorio and export them again to update them.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Usage</h2><a id="user-content-usage" aria-label="Permalink: Usage" href="#usage"></a></p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Open Factorio and create a blueprint.</li>
<li>Export the blueprint as text (in the upper left corner, next to the "Delete" button).</li>
<li>Go the the <a href="https://piebro.github.io/factorio-blueprint-visualizer/" rel="nofollow">website</a>.</li>
<li>Click the "Upload Blueprint" button and paste the text into the text area.</li>
<li>Now you can test new random drawing settings (using the buttons or the arrow keys) or edit the current drawing settings.</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">Documentation of the drawing settings can be found <a href="https://github.com/piebro/factorio-blueprint-visualizer/blob/master/drawing_settings_documentation.md">here</a>.</p>

<ul dir="auto">
<li>Factorio 2.0 and Factorio: Space Age are supported (Blueprints from earlier version might only work partially)</li>
<li>Ported everything from Python to Javascript for simplicity and performance.</li>
<li>Added ability to modify drawing settings.</li>
<li>Added support for tiles.</li>

<p id="speakable-summary">VLC media player, the popular open-source software developed by nonprofit VideoLAN, has topped 6 billion downloads worldwide and teased an AI-powered subtitle system.</p>

<p>The new feature automatically generates real-time subtitles — which can then also be translated in many languages — for any video using open-source AI models that run locally on users’ devices, eliminating the need for internet connectivity or cloud services, VideoLAN demoed at CES.</p>







<p>The firm didn’t say when it planned to rollout the feature.</p>

<p>VideoLAN started in 1996 as a project by students at Ecole Centrale Paris trying to stream videos across campus. Unlike many open-source projects that have struggled to survive on donations alone, VLC has maintained its free, ad-free model while expanding across multiple operating systems. The media player continues to operate without advertising, data collection, or commercial revenue streams.</p>

<p>“The number of active users of VLC is actually growing, even in this age of streaming services,” VideoLAN president Jean-Baptiste Kempf <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7282533937812258816/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">wrote</a> in a LinkedIn post.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="auto"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_Exchange" rel="">Stack Exchange</a><span> is a large online crowd sourced content provider for questions and answers. The Stack Exchange network of sites includes everything from </span><a href="https://cooking.stackexchange.com/" rel="">cooking</a><span>, to </span><a href="https://politics.stackexchange.com/" rel="">politics</a><span>, and </span><a href="https://judaism.stackexchange.com/" rel="">Judaism</a><span> and </span><a href="https://islam.stackexchange.com/" rel="">Islam</a><span>.  In 2021, it was sold to a private equity company </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosus" rel="">Prosus</a><span> for 1.8 billion USD. Its largest asset is </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_Overflow" rel="">Stack Overflow</a><span>, a site tailored to programmers. The Stack Overflow site is a vital resource for software developers. Ideally, it makes it easy and free to ask questions and get professional assistance.</span></p><p><span>On Stack Exchange, all of the contributions on the site are contributed under a license maintained by a third party called </span><a href="https://creativecommons.org/" rel="">Creative Commons</a><span>; Creative Commons provides a license which states that licensed content must be perpetually shareable for any purpose including modification and by anyone including for-profit ventures, so long as the work remains properly attributed. This incentivizes content creation because every contributor is working on a corpus of work which is free from royalties and modification restrictions: everyone is bettering and growing the commons by using the site. The only “payment” we get out for our work is recognition: the right granted under the Attribution Clause. The Stack Exchange network is further “gameified” with rankings and reputation (a quantifiable standing) to encourage active membership and community while keeping things fun. Work hard, have a larger contribution to the commons and be recognized as such.</span></p><p><span>Alas, this minimal obligation of attribution is too much for some companies which have sought to erode this right. Right now, on Stack Overflow, </span><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/4616250/user4616250" rel="">Luigi Magione’s account has been renamed</a><span>. Despite having fruitfully contributed to the network he is stripped of his name and his account is now known as “</span><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/4616250/user4616250" rel="">user4616250</a><span>”. As reported by one of the </span><a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/332043/zoe-save-the-data-dump" rel="">moderators, Zoe, on Stack Overflow.</a></p><blockquote><p><span>I can confirm SE, Inc. were the ones to clear his name. A reason was not specified anywhere obvious. Mods have been given explicit instructions not to touch that profile. While this particular incident may be limited to SO, the implications of this affect the entire network – </span><a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/332043/zoe-save-the-data-dump" rel="">Zoe - Save the data dump</a></p></blockquote><p><span>Though I’m not a lawyer, even with a guilty verdict I don’t believe Stack Exchange is freed from their contractual obligation of attribution under the Creative Commons license. However, in the spirit of the site I put the </span><a href="https://law.stackexchange.com/q/106594/218" rel="">preliminary legal question about the Creative Commons license to the experts on law.stackexchange.com</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>In order to get more information about the justification and reasoning for the unattribution, </span><a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/405208/157251" rel="">I asked a question on the “meta” site that helps run the network called meta.stackexchange</a><span>.

That's not a defense the employer can reasonably make at that point despite being otherwise actionable.</strong></p></blockquote><p>I concluded with the following,</p><blockquote><p><span>That said, I don't feel I ever </span><em>artificially</em><span> did anything; but, I understand how it looks. I did find all the contributions from the profile page, and I did reward all the bounties to a specific user who I felt was trying to be productive (and oblivious to any celebrity he currently has). But this is hardly a "pattern." When you say "pattern" you're referring to this single case (granted over days) with this single user, that culminated in the removal of bounties and upvotes which I just found out about when you told me.</span></p><p><span>My side of the story is easy: I saw an alleged killer that I believe is wrongly framed who has a good head on his shoulders get swept up by the justice system. I went online and viewed his contributions and thought they were warranting of incentive. I wanted to incentivize him to become a productive member of society, and of our network. Let's correct that if it's against policy: keep the bounties removed and the upvotes removed, but a prior offense shouldn't sit as a Trump card for punishment now. I started a respectful conversation because I believe Luigi Mangione should </span><em>NOT</em><span> be treated as a criminal prior to a conviction. That's the request of his defense attorney (today), and I believe there is a trend for that to happen which is wrong.</span></p><p>That's all I'm doing here in asking the question.</p></blockquote><p>How does this sit with how other tech sites react?</p><ul><li><p><span>GitHub, a division of Microsoft, still has </span><a href="https://github.com/lnmangione" rel="">Luigi’s profile online</a><span>. This indifference to a mere charge should be applauded. It’s unfortunate Stack Overflow couldn’t chart the same course. LinkedIn, also owned by Microsoft, seems to have </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/luigi-mangione/" rel="">Luigi’s LinkedIn</a><span> still active — however, I’m not sure this has been verified.</span></p></li><li><p>Reddit has deleted his account (presumed to be /u/Mister_Cactus)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.sfgate.com/tech/article/luigi-mangione-social-media-photos-19969945.php" rel="">Facebook and Instagram accounts are long gone</a><span>. They even </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/approarstudios" rel="">deleted his company page</a><span>.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Twitter removed the account and </span><a href="https://x.com/pepmangione" rel="">reinstated it later</a><span>, after </span><a href="https://x.com/_NicholasIrvine/status/1866273388693446699" rel="">Musk got involved</a></p></li><li><p><span>Goodreads made </span><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/55354261-luigi" rel="">his account</a><span> private, and </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/11/technology/social-media-goodreads-reddit-tiktok.html" rel="">waffled, reverting their decision a few times</a><span>.</span></p></li></ul><p>While all of these companies took different approaches the only one that chose to both erase him and keep the content, is Stack Exchange.</p></div></div>]]></description>
