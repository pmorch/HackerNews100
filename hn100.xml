            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://claude.com/blog/cowork-research-preview">https://claude.com/blog/cowork-research-preview</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46593022">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When we released Claude Code, we expected developers to use it for coding. They did—and then quickly began using it for <a href="https://x.com/claudeai/status/2009666254815269313" target="_blank" data-wf-native-id-path="d7e2b4a8-bd30-6427-2c54-02a35d22e170" data-wf-ao-click-engagement-tracking="true" data-wf-element-id="d7e2b4a8-bd30-6427-2c54-02a35d22e170">almost everything else</a>. This prompted us to build Cowork: a simpler way for anyone—<a href="https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/everyone-should-be-using-claude-code" target="_blank" data-wf-native-id-path="d7e2b4a8-bd30-6427-2c54-02a35d22e173" data-wf-ao-click-engagement-tracking="true" data-wf-element-id="d7e2b4a8-bd30-6427-2c54-02a35d22e173">not just developers</a>—to work with Claude in the very same way. Cowork is available today as a research preview for Claude Max subscribers on our <a href="https://claude.com/download" target="_blank" data-wf-native-id-path="d7e2b4a8-bd30-6427-2c54-02a35d22e176" data-wf-ao-click-engagement-tracking="true" data-wf-element-id="d7e2b4a8-bd30-6427-2c54-02a35d22e176">macOS app</a>, and we will improve it rapidly from here.</p><figure><p><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UAmKyyZ-b9E" title="Introducing Cowork: Claude Code for the rest of your work"></iframe></p></figure><p>How is using Cowork different from a regular conversation? In Cowork, you give Claude access to a folder of your choosing on your computer. Claude can then read, edit, or create files in that folder. It can, for example, re-organize your downloads by sorting and renaming each file, create a new spreadsheet with a list of expenses from a pile of screenshots, or produce a first draft of a report from your scattered notes.&nbsp;</p><p>In Cowork, Claude completes work like this with much more agency than you’d see in a regular conversation. Once you’ve set it a task, Claude will make a plan and steadily complete it, while looping you in on what it’s up to. If you’ve used Claude Code, this will feel familiar—Cowork is built on the very <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-agents-with-the-claude-agent-sdk" target="_blank" data-wf-native-id-path="638a9647-f7be-7484-3d32-f34fa167b82a" data-wf-ao-click-engagement-tracking="true" data-wf-element-id="638a9647-f7be-7484-3d32-f34fa167b82a">same foundations</a>. This means Cowork can take on many of the same tasks that Claude Code can handle, but in a more approachable form for non-coding tasks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>When you’ve mastered the basics, you can make Cowork more powerful still. Claude can use your existing <a href="https://claude.com/connectors" target="_blank" data-wf-native-id-path="638a9647-f7be-7484-3d32-f34fa167b82f" data-wf-ao-click-engagement-tracking="true" data-wf-element-id="638a9647-f7be-7484-3d32-f34fa167b82f">connectors</a>, which link Claude to external information, and in Cowork we’ve added an initial set of <a href="https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview" target="_blank" data-wf-native-id-path="638a9647-f7be-7484-3d32-f34fa167b832" data-wf-ao-click-engagement-tracking="true" data-wf-element-id="638a9647-f7be-7484-3d32-f34fa167b832">skills</a> that improve Claude’s ability to create documents, presentations, and other files. If you pair Cowork with <a href="https://claude.com/chrome" target="_blank" data-wf-native-id-path="638a9647-f7be-7484-3d32-f34fa167b835" data-wf-ao-click-engagement-tracking="true" data-wf-element-id="638a9647-f7be-7484-3d32-f34fa167b835">Claude in Chrome</a>, Claude can complete tasks that require browser access, too.</p><p>Cowork is designed to make using Claude for new work as simple as possible. You don’t need to keep manually providing context or converting Claude’s outputs into the right format. Nor do you have to wait for Claude to finish before offering further ideas or feedback: you can queue up tasks and let Claude work through them in parallel. It feels much less like a back-and-forth and much more like leaving messages for a coworker.&nbsp;</p><figure><p><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WBNZpAWhw5E" title="Organize your desktop files with Cowork"></iframe></p></figure><h2>Stay in control</h2><p>In Cowork, you can choose which folders and connectors Claude can see: Claude can’t read or edit anything you don’t give it explicit access to. Claude will also ask before taking any significant actions, so you can steer or course-correct it as you need.&nbsp;</p><p>That said, there are still things to be aware of before you give Claude control. By default, the main thing to know is that Claude can take potentially destructive actions (such as deleting local files) if it’s instructed to. Since there’s always some chance that Claude might misinterpret your instructions, you should give Claude very clear guidance around things like this.&nbsp;</p><p>You should also be aware of the risk of “<a href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/prompt-injection-defenses" target="_blank" data-wf-native-id-path="d7e2b4a8-bd30-6427-2c54-02a35d22e19c" data-wf-ao-click-engagement-tracking="true" data-wf-element-id="d7e2b4a8-bd30-6427-2c54-02a35d22e19c">prompt injections</a>”: attempts by attackers to alter Claude’s plans through content it might encounter on the internet. We’ve built sophisticated defenses against prompt injections, but agent safety—that is, the task of securing Claude’s real-world actions—is still an active area of development in the industry.&nbsp;</p><p>These risks aren’t new with Cowork, but it might be the first time you’re using a more advanced tool that moves beyond a simple conversation. We recommend taking precautions, particularly while you learn how it works. We provide more detail in our <a href="https://support.claude.com/en/articles/13364135-using-cowork-safely" target="_blank" data-wf-native-id-path="d7e2b4a8-bd30-6427-2c54-02a35d22e1a2" data-wf-ao-click-engagement-tracking="true" data-wf-element-id="d7e2b4a8-bd30-6427-2c54-02a35d22e1a2">Help Center</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2>Looking forward</h2><p>This is a research preview. We’re releasing Cowork early because we want to learn what people use it for, and how they think it could be better. We encourage you to experiment with what Cowork can do for you, and to try things you don’t expect to work: you might be surprised! As we learn more from this preview, we plan to make lots of improvements (including by adding cross-device sync and bringing it to Windows), and we’ll identify further ways to make it safer.&nbsp;</p><p>Claude Max subscribers can try Cowork now by downloading the <a href="https://claude.com/download" target="_blank" data-wf-native-id-path="d7e2b4a8-bd30-6427-2c54-02a35d22e1aa" data-wf-ao-click-engagement-tracking="true" data-wf-element-id="d7e2b4a8-bd30-6427-2c54-02a35d22e1aa">macOS app</a>, then clicking on “Cowork” in the sidebar.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span>After creating thousands</span> of <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/grok-is-pushing-ai-undressing-mainstream/#intcid=_wired-verso-hp-trending_e6f38b98-522c-48d8-be73-d982c8e641e2_popular4-2">“undressing” pictures of women</a> and sexualized imagery of apparent minors, Elon Musk’s X has apparently limited who can generate images with Grok. However, despite the changes, the chatbot is still being used to create “undressing” sexualized images on the platform.</p><p>On Friday morning, the Grok account on X started responding to some users’ requests with a message saying that image generation and editing are “currently limited to paying subscribers.” The message also includes a link pushing people toward the social media platform’s $395 annual subscription tier. In one test of the system requesting Grok create an image of a tree, the system returned the same message.</p><p>The apparent change comes after days of growing outrage against and <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/x-grok-app-store-nudify-csam-apple-google-content-moderation/">scrutiny</a> of Musk’s X and xAI, the company behind the Grok chatbot. The companies face an increasing number of investigations from regulators around the world over the creation of nonconsensual explicit imagery and alleged sexual images of children. British prime minister Keir Starmer <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgjzknepvzo">has not ruled out</a> banning X in the country and said the actions have been “unlawful.”</p><p>Neither X nor xAI, the Musk-owned company behind Grok, has confirmed that it has made image generation and editing a paid-only feature. An X spokesperson acknowledged WIRED’s inquiry but did not provide comment ahead of publication. X has previously <a data-offer-url="https://x.com/Safety/status/2007648212421587223" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://x.com/Safety/status/2007648212421587223&quot;}" href="https://x.com/Safety/status/2007648212421587223" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">said</a> it takes “action against illegal content on X,” including instances of child sexual abuse material. While Apple and Google have previously banned apps with similar “nudify” features, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/x-grok-app-store-nudify-csam-apple-google-content-moderation/">X and Grok remain available</a> in their respective app stores. xAI did not immediately respond to WIRED's request for comment.</p><p>For more than a week, users on X have been asking the chatbot to edit images of women to remove their clothes—often asking for the image to contain a “string” or “transparent” bikini. While a public feed of images created by Grok contained far fewer results of these “undressing” images on Friday, it still created sexualized images when prompted to by X users with paid for “verified” accounts.</p><p>“We observe the same kind of prompt, we observe the same kind of outcome, just fewer than before,” Paul Bouchaud, lead researcher at Paris-based nonprofit AI Forensics, tells WIRED. “The model can continue to generate bikini [images],” they say.</p><p>A WIRED review of some Grok posts on Friday morning identified Grok generating images in response to user requests for images that “put her in latex lingerie” and “put her in a plastic bikini and cover her in donut white glaze.” The images appear behind a “content warning” box saying that adult material is displayed.</p><p>On Wednesday, WIRED revealed that Grok’s stand-alone website and app, which is separate from the version on X, has also been used in recent months to create <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/grok-is-generating-sexual-content-far-more-graphic-than-whats-on-x/#intcid=_wired-verso-hp-trending_e6f38b98-522c-48d8-be73-d982c8e641e2_popular4-2">highly graphic and sometimes violent sexual videos</a>, including celebrities and other real people. Bouchaud says it is still possible to use Grok to make these videos. “I was able to generate a video with sexually explicit content without any restriction from an unverified account,” they say.</p><p>While WIRED’s test of image generation using Grok on X using a free account did not allow any images to be created, using a free account on Grok’s app and website still generated images.</p><p>The change on X could immediately limit the amount of sexually explicit and harmful material the platform is creating, experts say. But it has also been criticized as a minimal step that acts as a band-aid to the real harms <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/deepfake-survivor-breeze-liu-microsoft/">caused by nonconsensual intimate imagery</a>.</p><p>“The recent decision to restrict access to paying subscribers is not only inadequate—it represents the monetization of abuse,” Emma Pickering, head of technology-facilitated abuse at UK domestic abuse charity Refuge, said in a statement. “While limiting AI image generation to paid users may marginally reduce volume and improve traceability, the abuse has not been stopped. It has simply been placed behind a paywall, allowing X to profit from harm.”</p></div></div>]]></description>

The first attack of rheumatism was a week before I saw you, and the second when I saw you, and the third when I saw you, and the third in the same time. The second attack of gout, however, was not accompanied by any febrile symptoms, but was accompanied with an increased flow of urine, and with a more copious discharge of urine. The third attack was an hour after I saw you, and was succeeded by a return of a paroxysm of gout, and a more rapid return of the gout. The fourth attack was also accompanied by a fever, but was not always accompanied by any febrile symptoms. The third attack of gout was a fortnight after you had been ill, and the fourth was followed by a paroxysm of gout. The fourth attack was a fortnight after you were attacked, and was accompanied by a sense</p>

<p dir="auto">Selective Temporal Training (STT) is a machine learning methodology where all training data is specifically curated to fall within a specific historical time period. It's done in order to model the language and knowledge of that era without influence from modern concepts. For example, the current model I have now (v0.5) is trained on data exclusively from 1800-1875, it's not fine tuned but trained from scratch resulting in output that reflects the linguistic style and historical context of that time period.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Why not just use fine-tuning or LoRA?</h2><a id="user-content-why-not-just-use-fine-tuning-or-lora" aria-label="Permalink: Why not just use fine-tuning or LoRA?" href="#why-not-just-use-fine-tuning-or-lora"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">For this project I'm trying to create a language model that is unclouded from modern bias. If I fine-tune something like GPT-2, it's already pre-trained and that information won't go away. If I train from scratch the language model won't pretend to be old, it just will be. The Goal for this project right now is to create something can reason exclusively using knowledge from London books published between 1800 and 1875.</p>

<p dir="auto">I'm using books, legal documents, newspapers, and other writings from 1800–1875 London. The list I linked (for v0) has like 200 but for the first training I just used 50 files about ~187 MB. You can view a list of the documents:

  <p>Time makes fools of us all, and JavaScript is no slouch in that department either. Honestly, I’ve never minded the latter much — in fact, if you’ve taken <a href="https://piccalil.li/javascript-for-everyone">JavaScript for Everyone</a> or tuned into the <a href="https://wil.to/posts#js4e">newsletter</a>, you already know that I largely <em>enjoy</em> JavaScript’s little quirks, believe it or not.</p>
<p>I like when you can see the seams; I like how, for as formal and iron-clad as the ES-262 specification might seem, you can still see all the good <em>and</em> bad decisions made by the hundreds of people who’ve been building the language in mid-flight, if you know where to look. JavaScript has <em>character</em>. Sure, it doesn’t necessarily do everything <em>exactly</em> the way one might expect, but y’know, if you ask me, JavaScript has a real charm once you get to know it!</p>
<p>There’s one part of the language where that immediately falls apart for me, though.</p>

<p><code>Date</code> sucks. It was hastily and shamelessly copied off of Java’s homework in the car on the way to school and it got all the same answers wrong, right down to the name at the top of the page: <code>Date</code> doesn’t represent a <em>date</em>, it represents a <em>time</em>. Internally, dates are stored as number values called <strong>time values</strong>: Unix timestamps, divided into 1,000 milliseconds — which, okay, yes, a Unix time does also necessarily imply a date, sure, but <em>still</em>: Date represents a time, from which you can infer a date. Gross.</p>

<div><p>Words like “date” and “time” mean things, but, sure — <em>whatever, JavaScript</em>.</p></div>
<p>Java deprecated <em>their</em> <code>Date</code> way back in 1997, only a few years after JavaScript’s <code>Date</code> was turned loose on the unsuspecting world; meanwhile, we’ve been saddled with this mess ever since. It’s wildly inconsistent when it comes to parsing dates, as you’ve seen so far here. It has no sense of time zones beyond the local one and GMT, which is not ideal where “world-wide” is <em>right there in the web’s name</em> — and speaking-of, <code>Date</code> <em>only</em> respects the Gregorian calendar model. It wholesale does not understand the concept of daylight savings time, which— I mean, okay, yeah, samesies, but I’m not <em>made of computers</em>. All these shortcomings make it exceptionally common to use a third-party library dedicated to working around it all, some of which are absolutely <em>massive</em>; a performance drain that has done real and measurable damage to the web.</p>
<p>None of these are my major issue with <code>Date</code>. My complaint is about more than parsing or syntax or “developer ergonomics” or the web-wide performance impact of wholly necessary workarounds or even the definition of the word “date.” My issue with <code>Date</code> is soul-deep. My problem with <code>Date</code> is that using it means <em>deviating from the fundamental nature of time itself</em>.</p>

<p>All JavaScript’s primitives values are <strong>immutable</strong>, meaning that the values themselves cannot be changed. The number value <code>3</code> can never represent anything but the concept of “three” — you can’t make <code>true</code> mean anything other than “true.” These are values with concrete, iron-clad, real-world meanings. We know what three is. It can’t be some other non-three thing. These immutable data types are stored <strong>by value</strong>, meaning that a variable that represents the number value <code>3</code> effectively “contains” — and thus behaves as — the number value <code>3</code>.</p>
<p>When an immutable value is assigned to a variable, the JavaScript engine creates a copy of that value and stores the copy in memory:</p>

<p>This fits the common mental model for “a variable” just fine: <code>theNumber</code> “contains” <code>3</code>.</p>
<p>When we initialize <code>theOtherNumber</code> with the value bound to <code>theNumber</code>, that mental model holds: once again a <code>3</code> is created and stored in memory. <code>theOtherNumber</code> can now be thought of as containing its own discrete <code>3</code>.</p>

<div><p>You can’t change the binding of a <code>const</code>, and you <em>definitely</em> can’t alter the meaning of <code>3</code>.</p></div>
<p>Data types that <em>can</em> be changed after they’re created are <strong>mutable</strong>, meaning that the data value <em>itself</em> can be altered. Object values — any non-primitive value, like an array, map, or set — are mutable.</p>
<p>Variables (and object properties, function parameters, and elements in an array, set, or map) can’t “contain” an object, the way we might think of <code>theNumber</code> in the example above as “containing” <code>3</code>. A variable can contain either a primitive value or a <strong>reference value</strong>, the latter of which is a pointer to that object’s stored location in memory. When you assign an object to a variable, instead of creating a copy of that object, the identifier represents a reference to the object’s stored position in memory. That’s why an object bound to a variable declared with <code>const</code> can still be altered: the <em>reference value</em> can’t be changed, but the values of the object can:</p>

<p>When a reference value is assigned from one variable to another, the JavaScript engine creates a copy of that reference value — not the object value itself, the way a discrete copy is made of a primitive value.

<p><em>This</em> is what gets me about JavaScript’s date handling. Despite representing “point to it on a calendar” values, JavaScript’s date values are <em>mutable —</em> <code>Date</code> is a constructor, invoking a constructor with <code>new</code> necessarily results in an object, and all objects are inherently mutable:</p>

<p>See what happened there? the variable <code>today</code> represents a reference to the object created by <code>new Date()</code>. When we provided <code>today</code> as an argument to the <code>addDay</code> function, the parameter <code>theDate</code> now represents a copy of the reference value — not a copy of the value, but a second reference to the object that represents today’s date. When we manipulate that value to determine the date of the following day, we’re manipulating the mutable object in memory, not an immutable copy — today becomes tomorrow, the falcon has a hard time hearing the falconer, the center starts to look a little iffy vis-a-vis “holding,” and so on.</p>
<p>Now, by this point you can probably tell that I’m not here to praise <code>Date</code>, but what you might not expect is that I’m here to <em>bury</em> it. That’s right: <code>Date</code> is soon to be over, done, gone, as “deprecated” as any part of the web platform can be — which is to say, “around forever, but you shouldn’t use it anymore, if you can avoid it.” Soon we will — at long last — have an object that replaces <code>Date</code> wholesale: <code>Temporal</code>.</p>

<p>Well, we’re kind of at the mercy of the nature of the language, here: dates represent complex real-world values, complex data necessitates complex data structures, and for JavaScript, that means objects. The difference is in how we <em>interact</em> with these Temporal objects, as compared to instances of <code>Date</code>, and — as is so often the case — the magic is in the prototype chain:</p>

<p>Right away you’ll notice that there are a number of methods and properties devoted to accessing, formatting, and manipulating the details of the Temporal object we’re working with. No big surprises there — it means a little bit of a learning curve, sure, but nothing an occasional trip over to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Temporal">MDN</a> couldn’t solve, and they all more-or-less do what they say on their respective tins. The big difference from working with <code>Date</code> is <em>how</em> they do so, at a fundamental level:</p>

</div>
<p>Notice how none of these transformations required us to manually spin up any new objects, <em>and</em> that the value of the object referenced by <code>nowTemporal</code> remains unchanged? Unlike <code>Date</code>,  the methods we use to interact with a Temporal object result in <em>new</em> Temporal objects, rather than requiring us to use them in the context of a new instance or to modify the instance we’re working with — which is how we’re able to chain the <code>add</code> and <code>subtract</code> methods together in <code>nowTemporal.add({ months: 1, days: 1 }).subtract({ years: 2 })</code>.</p>
<p>Sure, we’re still working with objects, and that means we’re working with mutable data structures that represent real-world values:</p>

<p>…But the value represented by that Temporal object isn’t meant to be changed during the normal course of interacting with it — even though the object is still essentially mutable, we’re not stuck using that object in ways that could alter what it means in terms of real-world dates and times. I’ll take it.</p>
<p>So, let’s revisit that janky little “today is X, tomorrow is Y” script we wrote using <code>Date</code> earlier. First, we’ll fix it by making sure we’re working with two discrete instances of <code>Date</code> rather than modifying the instance that represents today’s date:</p>

<p>Okay, fine. It gets the job done, just as it has since the day <code>Date</code> first bumbled its way onto the web. We’re not unwittingly altering the value of <code>today</code> since we’re spinning up a new instance of <code>Date</code> inside our <code>addDay</code> function — wordy, but it works, as it has for decades now. We add <code>1</code> to it, which we have to just kind of <em>know</em> means add one <em>day.</em> Then in our template literal we need to keep nudging JavaScript to give us the date in a format that doesn’t include the current time, as a string. It’s functional, but verbose.</p>
<p>Now, let’s redo it using <code>Temporal</code>:</p>

<p><em>So much better</em>. Leaner, meaner, and <em>way</em> less margin for error. We want today’s date without the time, and the object that results from invoking <code>plainDateISO</code> (and any new Temporal objects created from it) will retain that formatting <em>without</em> being coerced to a string. Formatting: <em>check</em>.</p>
<p>We want to output a value that represents today’s date plus one day, and we want to do so in a way where we are unmistakably saying “add one day to it” with no parsing guesswork: <em>check</em> and <em>check</em>.</p>
<p>Most importantly, we don’t want to run the risk of having our original <code>today</code> object altered unintentionally — because the result of calling the <code>add</code> method will always be a new Temporal object: <em>check</em>.</p>
<p><code>Temporal</code> is going to be a <em>massive</em> improvement over <code>Date</code>, and I only say “going to be” because it still isn’t quite ready for prime-time usage. <a href="https://tc39.es/proposal-temporal/">The draft specification for the proposed <code>Temporal</code> object</a> has reached stage three of the standardization process, meaning it is now officially “recommended for implementation” — not yet part of the standard that informs the ongoing development of JavaScript itself, but close enough that browsers can start tinkering with it. That means the results of that early experimentation may be used to further refine the specification, so nothing is set in stone just yet. Web standards are an iterative process, after all.</p>
<p>That’s where you and I come in. Now that <code>Temporal</code> has <a href="https://caniuse.com/?search=Temporal">landed in the latest versions of Chrome and Firefox</a> — and others, soon — it’s time for us to get in there and kick the tires a little bit. We may not have had any say in <code>Date</code>, but we get to experiment with <code>Temporal</code> before the final implementations land.</p>
<p>Soon, JavaScript will have sensible, modern date handling, and we’ll finally be able to cram <code>Date</code> way in the back of the junk drawer with the rubber bands, mismatched jar lids, mystery keys, and probably-half-empty AA batteries — still present, still an inexorable part of the web platform, but no longer our first, last, and only way of handling dates. And we only had to wait— well, hold on, let me just crunch the numbers real quick:</p>
<div>
  <astro-island uid="ZO0XPc" prefix="r9" component-url="/_astro/ConsoleLogger.67Rv-5VD.js" component-export="default" renderer-url="/_astro/client.BIGLHmRd.js" props="{&quot;instruction&quot;:[0],&quot;code&quot;:[0,&quot;\nconst today = Temporal.Now.plainDateISO();\nconst jsShipped = Temporal.PlainDate.from( \&quot;1995-12-04\&quot; );\nconst sinceDate = today.since( jsShipped, { largestUnit: 'year' });\n\nconsole.log( `${ sinceDate.years } years, ${ sinceDate.months } months, and ${ sinceDate.days } days.` );\n&quot;],&quot;language&quot;:[0,&quot;js&quot;],&quot;outputType&quot;:[0,&quot;log&quot;],&quot;consoleOutput&quot;:[0,&quot;\n30 years, 0 months, and 27 days.\n&quot;],&quot;showLineNumbers&quot;:[0,false]}" ssr="" client="load" opts="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;ConsoleLogger&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:true}" await-children=""><div><p data-wrapper-type="inner"><h3>Try it out</h3></p><hr><div data-wrapper-type="inner"><pre tabindex="0"><code>const today = Temporal.Now.plainDateISO();
const jsShipped = Temporal.PlainDate.from( "1995-12-04" );
const sinceDate = today.since( jsShipped, { largestUnit: 'year' });

console.log( `${ sinceDate.years } years, ${ sinceDate.months } months, and ${ sinceDate.days } days.` );</code></pre></div></div><template data-astro-template="">
    
  </template><!--astro:end--></astro-island>
</div>
<p>Sure, the best time to replace <code>Date</code> would’ve been back in 1995, but hey: the second best time is <code>Temporal.Now</code>, right?</p>

                    <p>Good evening.</p>

<p>On Friday, the Department of Justice served the Federal Reserve with grand jury subpoenas, threatening a criminal indictment related to my testimony before the Senate Banking Committee last June. That testimony concerned in part a multi-year project to renovate historic Federal Reserve office buildings.</p>

<p>I have deep respect for the rule of law and for accountability in our democracy. No one—certainly not the chair of the Federal Reserve—is above the law. But this unprecedented action should be seen in the broader context of the administration's threats and ongoing pressure.</p>

<p>This new threat is not about my testimony last June or about the renovation of the Federal Reserve buildings. It is not about Congress's oversight role; the Fed through testimony and other public disclosures made every effort to keep Congress informed about the renovation project. Those are pretexts. The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the President.</p>

<p>This is about whether the Fed will be able to continue to set interest rates based on evidence and economic conditions—or whether instead monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation.</p>

<p>I have served at the Federal Reserve under four administrations, Republicans and Democrats alike. In every case, I have carried out my duties without political fear or favor, focused solely on our mandate of price stability and maximum employment. Public service sometimes requires standing firm in the face of threats. I will continue to do the job the Senate confirmed me to do, with integrity and a commitment to serving the American people.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
        
        <p>A few years ago, I wrote a blog post on <a href="https://www.npopov.com/2021/06/02/Design-issues-in-LLVM-IR.html">design issues in LLVM IR</a>. Since then, one of these issues has been fixed fully (opaque pointers migration), one has been mostly fixed (constant expression removal), and one is well on the way towards being fixed (ptradd migration).</p>

<p>This time I’m going to be more ambitious and not stop at three issues. Of course, not all of these issues are of equal importance, and how important they are depends on who you ask. In the interest of brevity, I will mostly just explain what the problem is, and not discuss what possible solutions would be.</p>

<p>Finally, I should probably point out that this is written from my perspective as the lead maintainer of the LLVM project: This is not a list of reasons to not use LLVM, it’s a list of opportunities to improve LLVM.</p>

<h2 id="high-level-issues">High level issues</h2>

<h3 id="review-capacity">Review capacity</h3>

<p>Unlike many other open-source projects, LLVM certainly <a href="https://insights.linuxfoundation.org/project/llvm-llvm-project">does not suffer</a> from a lack of contributors. There are <em>thousands</em> of contributors and the distribution is relatively flat (that is, it’s not the case that a small handful of people is responsible for the majority of contributions.)</p>

<p>What LLVM does suffer from is insufficient review capacity. There are a lot more people writing code than reviewing it. This is somewhat unsurprising, as code review requires more expertise than writing code, and may not provide immediate value<sup id="fnref:review_value" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:review_value" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> to the person reviewing (or their employer).</p>

<p>Lack of review capacity makes for a bad contributor experience, and can also result in bad changes making their way into the codebase. The way this usually works out is that someone puts up a PR, then fails to get a qualified review for a long period of time, and then one of their coworkers (who is not a qualified reviewer for that area) ends up rubberstamping the PR.</p>

<p>A related problem is that LLVM has a somewhat peculiar contribution model where it’s the responsibility of the PR author to request reviewers. This is especially problematic for new contributors, who don’t know whom to request. Often relevant reviewers will become aware of the PR thanks to a label-based notification system, but this is not apparent from the UI, and it’s easy for PRs to fall through the cracks.</p>

<p>A potential improvement here would be a Rust-style <a href="https://forge.rust-lang.org/triagebot/pr-assignment.html">PR assignment system</a>.</p>

<h3 id="churn">Churn</h3>

<p>Both the LLVM C++ API and LLVM IR are not stable and undergo frequent changes. This is simultaneously a great strength and weakness of LLVM. It’s a strength because LLVM does not stagnate and is willing to address past mistakes even at significant cost. It’s a weakness because churn imposes costs on users of LLVM.</p>

<p>Frontends are <em>somewhat</em> insulated from this because they can use the largely stable C API. However, it does not cover everything, and most major frontends will have additional bindings that use the unstable C++ API.</p>

<p>Users that integrate with LLVM more tightly (for example downstream backends) don’t have that option, and have to keep up with all API changes.</p>

<p>This is part of LLVM’s general development philosophy, which I’ll express somewhat pointedly as “upstream or GTFO”. LLVM is liberally licensed and does not require you to contribute changes upstream. However, if you do not upstream your code, then it will also not factor into upstream decision-making.</p>

<p>This point is somewhat unlike the rest, in that I’m not sure it’s possible to make things “strictly better” here. It’s possible that LLVM’s current point on the stability scale is not optimal, but moving it somewhere else would come with significant externalities. Making major changes in LLVM is already extremely hard due to the sheer scale of the project, without adding additional stability constraints on top.</p>

<h3 id="build-time">Build time</h3>

<p>LLVM is a huge project. LLVM itself is &gt;2.5 million lines of C++ and the entire monorepo is something like 9 million. C++ is not exactly known for fast build times, and compiling all that code takes time. This is bearable if you either have fast hardware or access to a build farm, but trying to build LLVM on a low-spec laptop is not going to be fun.</p>

<p>An additional complication is building with debug info (which I always recommend against), in which case you’ll add the extra gotchas of slow link times, high risk of OOM and massive disk usage. There are ways to avoid that (using shared libs or dylib build, using split dwarf, using lld), but it takes some expertise.</p>

<p>Promising changes in this area are the <a href="https://discourse.llvm.org/t/rfc-use-pre-compiled-headers-to-speed-up-llvm-build-by-1-5-2x/89345?u=nikic">use of pre-compiled headers</a> (which significantly improves build time), and changing to use a <a href="https://discourse.llvm.org/t/rfc-llvm-link-llvm-dylib-should-default-to-on-on-posix-platforms/85908?u=nikic">dylib build by default</a> (which reduces disk usage and link time, esp. for debuginfo builds). Another is to <a href="https://discourse.llvm.org/t/rfc-reducing-process-creation-overhead-in-llvm-regression-tests/88612?u=nikic">reduce test overhead</a> using daemonization (not strictly part of the “build time”, but relevant for the development cycle).</p>

<h3 id="ci-stability">CI stability</h3>

<p>LLVM CI consists of over 200 post-commit buildbots that test LLVM in lots of different configurations on lots of different hardware. Commits that turn a buildbot from green to red result in an email to the commit author.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this CI is never fully green, and flaky on top. This is in part due to flaky tests (typically in lldb or openmp), but can also be due to buildbot-specific issues. The end result is that it’s “normal” to get buildbot failure notifications for any given commit, even if it is perfectly harmless. This dilutes the signal, and makes it easier to miss the real failures.</p>

<p>The introduction of pre-merge testing on PRs did significantly improve the overall CI situation, but not the buildbot problem as such. I think we need to start taking flaky tests/buildbots more seriously before we can really make progress here.</p>

<p>Because someone is definitely going to mention how this <a href="https://graydon2.dreamwidth.org/1597.html">is not rocket science</a>, and we just need to start using bors / merge queues to guarantee an always-green build: It’s a problem of scale. There are &gt;150 commits on a typical workday, which would be more than one commit every 10 minutes even if they were uniformly distributed. Many buildbots have multi-hour runs. This is hard to reconcile.<sup id="fnref:bors" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:bors" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<h3 id="end-to-end-testing">End-to-end testing</h3>

<p>In some respects, LLVM has very thorough test coverage. We’re quite pedantic about making sure that new optimizations have good coverage of both positive and negative tests. However, these tests are essentially unit tests for a single optimization pass or analysis.</p>

<p>We have only a small amount of coverage for the entire optimization pipeline (phase ordering tests), so optimizations sometimes regress due to pass interactions. Tests for the combination of the middle-end and backend pipelines are essentially nonexistent. There is likely room for improvement here, though it comes with tradeoffs.</p>

<p>However, what actually concerns me are end-to-end executable tests. LLVM’s test suite proper does not feature these at all. Executable tests are located in a separate <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-test-suite">llvm-test-suite</a> repo, which is typically not used during routine development, but run by buildbots. It contains a lot of different code ranging from benchmarks to unit tests.</p>

<p>However, llvm-test-suite has quite few tests (compared to LLVM lit tests) and does not comprehensively cover basic operations. Things like testing operations on different float formats, on integers of different sizes, vectors of different sizes and element types, etc.</p>

<p>In part this is because of limitations of testing through C/C++, which is very heterogeneous in type support (C compilers don’t like exposing types that don’t have a defined psABI for the target). But that’s no excuse to delegate this testing to Zig instead (which exposes everything, everywhere, and has the corresponding test coverage).</p>

<h3 id="backend-divergence">Backend divergence</h3>

<p>While LLVM’s middle-end is very unified, backend implementations are very heterogeneous, and there is a tendency to fix issues (usually performance, but sometimes even correctness) only for the backend you’re interested in.</p>

<p>This takes many forms, like implementing target-specific DAG combines instead of generic ones. Though my definite favorite is to introduce lots of target hooks for optimizations – not because the optimization is actually only beneficial for one target, but because the person introducing it just doesn’t want to deal with the fallout on other targets.</p>

<p>This is understandable – after all, they may lack the knowledge to evaluate a change for other targets, so it may require working with many other maintainers, which can slow progress a lot. But the end result is still increasing divergence and duplication.</p>

<p>Lack of end-to-end testing compounds this issue, because that would act as something of a forcing function that at least all operations compile without crashing and produce correct results for all tested targets.</p>

<h3 id="compilation-time">Compilation time</h3>

<p>Because I’ve <a href="https://www.npopov.com/2020/05/10/Make-LLVM-fast-again.html">complained</a> about this enough in the past, I’ll keep it short: LLVM is slow, which is an issue both for JIT use cases, and anything that tends to produce huge amounts of IR (like Rust or C++).</p>

<p>Since I’ve started <a href="https://llvm-compile-time-tracker.com/">tracking compile-times</a>, the situation has significantly improved, both through targeted improvements and avoidance of regressions. However, there is still a lot of room for improvement: LLVM still isn’t fast, it’s just less slow.</p>

<p>One thing that LLVM is particularly bad at are <code>-O0</code> compile-times. The architecture is optimized for optimization, and lots of costs remain even if no optimization takes place. The <a href="https://discourse.llvm.org/t/tpde-llvm-10-20x-faster-llvm-o0-back-end/86664?u=nikic">LLVM TPDE</a> alternative backend shows that it’s possible to do better by an order of magnitude.</p>

<h3 id="performance-tracking">Performance tracking</h3>

<p>The flip side of the compile-time coin is runtime performance. This is something that LLVM obviously cares a lot about. Which is why I find it rather surprising that LLVM does not have any “official” performance tracking infrastructure.</p>

<p>Of course, there are lots of organizations which track performance of LLVM downstream, on their own workloads. In some ways this is good, because it means there is more focus on real-world workloads than on synthetic benchmarks like SPEC. However, not having readily accessible, public performance tracking also makes it hard for contributors to evaluate changes.</p>

<p>To be fair, LLVM does have an <a href="https://lnt.llvm.org/">LNT</a> instance, but a) it’s currently broken, b) LNT is one of the worst UX crimes ever committed, c) little data gets submitted there, and d) it’s not possible to request a test run for a PR, or something like that.</p>

<p>This point is frankly just baffling to me. I don’t personally care about SPEC scores, but I know plenty of people do, so why there is no first-class tracking for this is a mystery to me.</p>

<h2 id="ir-design">IR design</h2>

<h3 id="undef-values">Undef values</h3>

<p><a href="https://llvm.org/docs/UndefinedBehavior.html#undef-values">Undef values</a> take an arbitrary value from a certain set. They are used to model uninitialized values, and have historically been used to model deferred undefined behavior. The latter role has been replaced by poison values, which have much simpler propagation rules and are more amenable to optimization. However, undef is still used for uninitialized memory to this day.</p>

<p>There are two main problems with undef values. The first is the multi-use problem: An undef value can take a different value at each use. This means that transforms that increase the use count are generally invalid, and care has to be taken when optimizing based on value equality. The mere existence of undef values prevents us from performing optimizations we want to do, or greatly increases their complexity.</p>

<p>The second issue is that undef is very hard to reason about. Humans have trouble understanding it, and for proof-checkers it is computationally expensive.</p>

<p>Most likely, uninitialized memory will be represented using poison values instead in the future, but this runs into the problem that LLVM currently is not capable of correctly treating poison in memory. Proper support for poison in memory requires additional IR features, like the <a href="https://blog.llvm.org/posts/2025-08-29-gsoc-byte-type/">byte type</a>.</p>

<h3 id="unsoundness-and-specification-incompleteness">Unsoundness and specification incompleteness</h3>

<p>While most miscompilations (that is, correctness bugs) in LLVM are resolved quickly, there are quite a few that remain unfixed despite having been known for a long time. These issues usually combine the qualities of being largely theoretical (that is, appearing only in artificially constructed examples rather than real-world code) and running up against issues in LLVM’s IR design.</p>

<p>Some of them are cases where we have a good idea of how the IR design needs to change to address the issue, but these changes are complex and often require a lot of work to recover optimization parity. There is often a complexity cliff where you can do something that’s simple and <em>nearly</em> correct, or you can do something very complex that is fully correct.</p>

<p>Then there are other cases, where just deciding on how things <em>should</em> work is a hard problem. The provenance model is a prime example of this. The interaction of provenance with integer casts and type punning is a difficult problem with complex tradeoffs.</p>

<p>However, at some point these issues do need to be resolved. The recently formed <a href="https://discourse.llvm.org/t/rfc-forming-a-working-group-on-formal-specification-for-llvm/89056?u=nikic">formal specification working group</a> aims to tackle these problems.</p>

<h3 id="constraint-encoding">Constraint encoding</h3>

<p>A key challenge for optimizing compilers is encoding of constraints (like “this value is non-negative” or “this add will not overflow”). This includes both frontend-provided constraints (based on language undefined behavior rules), but also compiler-generated ones.</p>

<p>In particular, there are many different analyses that can infer facts about the program, but keeping these up-to-date throughout optimization is challenging. One good way to handle this is to encode facts directly in the IR. Correctly updating or discarding these annotations then becomes part of transform correctness.</p>

<p>LLVM has many different ways to encode additional constraints (poison flags, metadata, attributes, assumes), and these all come with tradeoffs in terms of how much information can be encoded, how reliably it is retained during optimization and to what degree it can <em>negatively</em> affect optimization. Information from metadata is lost too often, while information from assumes is not lost often enough.</p>

<h3 id="floating-point-semantics">Floating-point semantics</h3>

<p>There are various issues with floating-point (FP) semantics once we move outside the nice world of “strictly conforming IEEE 754 floats in the default environment”. A few that come to mind are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Handling of signaling NaN and FP exceptions, and non-default FP environment in general. LLVM represents this using constrained FP intrinsics. This is not ideal, as all the FP handling is split into two parallel universes.</li>
  <li>Handling of denormals. LLVM has a function attribute to not assume IEEE denormal behavior, but this is only suitable for cases where flush to zero (FTZ) is used globally. It does not help with modeling cases like ARM, where scalar ops are IEEE, while vector ops use FTZ.</li>
  <li>Handling of excess precision, in particular when using the x87 FPU.</li>
</ul>

<!--### Type-based representation

This is something I've written about enough in the past, so I'll keep it brief: For historical reasons, LLVM IR encodes unnecessary type information that no longer carries any semantic meaning in various places. The biggest offender here were pointer element types, which were removed by the [opaque pointers migration][opaque_pointers].-->

<h2 id="other-technical-issues">Other technical issues</h2>

<h3 id="partial-migrations">Partial migrations</h3>

<p>LLVM is a very large project, and making any significant changes to it is hard and time consuming. Migrations often span years, where two different implementations of something coexist, until all code has been migrated. The two prime examples of this are:</p>

<p><strong>New pass manager:</strong> The “new” pass manager was first introduced more than a decade ago. Then about five years ago, we started using it for the middle-end optimization pipeline by default, and support for the legacy PM was dropped.</p>

<p>However, the back-end is still using the legacy pass manager. There is ongoing work to support the new pass manager in codegen, and we’re pretty close to the point where it can be used end-to-end for a single target. However, I expect it will still take quite a while for all targets to be ported and the legacy pass manager to be completely retired.</p>

<p><strong>GlobalISel:</strong> This is an even more extreme case. GlobalISel is the “new” instruction selector that is intended to replace SelectionDAG (and FastISel). It was introduced approximately one decade ago, and to this day, none of the targets that originally used SelectionDAG have been fully migrated to GlobalISel. There is one new target that’s GlobalISel-only, and there is one that uses GlobalISel by default for unoptimized builds. But otherwise, SelectionDAG is still the default everywhere.</p>

<p>There are two backends (AMDGPU and AArch64) that have somewhat complete GlobalISel support, but it’s not clear when/if they’ll be able to switch to using it by default. A big problem here is that new optimizations are continually being implemented on the SDAG side, so it’s hard to keep parity.</p>

<h3 id="abi--calling-convention-handling">ABI / calling convention handling</h3>

<p>Essentially everything about the handling of calling conventions in LLVM is a mess.</p>

<p>The responsibility for handling calling conventions is split between the frontend and the backend. There are good reasons why LLVM can’t do this by itself (LLVM IR sits at a too low level of abstraction to satisfy the extremely arcane ABI rules).</p>

<p>This is not a problem in itself – however, there is zero documentation of what the calling convention contract between the frontend and LLVM is, and the proper way to implement C FFI is essentially to look at what Clang does and copy that (invariably with errors, because the rules can be very subtle).</p>

<p>I’ve proposed to fix this by introducing an <a href="https://discourse.llvm.org/t/rfc-an-abi-lowering-library-for-llvm/84495?u=nikic">ABI lowering library</a> and vortex73 has <a href="https://blog.llvm.org/posts/2025-08-25-abi-library/">implemented a prototype</a> for it as part of GSoC. So we’re well on the way to resolving this side of the problem.</p>

<p>There are more problems though. One that Rust has struggled with a lot is the interaction of target features with the calling convention. Enabling additional target features can change the call ABI, because additional float/vector registers start getting used for argument/return passing. This means that calls between functions with a feature enabled and disabled may be incompatible, because they assume different ABIs.</p>

<p>Ideally, ABI and target features would be orthogonal, and only coupled in that some ABIs require certain target features (e.g. you can’t have a hard float ABI without enabling FP registers). Target features are a per-function choice, while the ABI should be per-module.</p>

<p>Some of the newer architectures like Loongarch and RISC-V actually have proper ABI design, but most of the older ones don’t. For example, it’s currently not possible to target AArch64 with a soft float ABI but hard float implementation.</p>

<h3 id="builtins--libcalls">Builtins / libcalls</h3>

<p>Somewhat related to this is the handling of compiler builtins/libcalls, which are auxiliary functions that the compiler may emit for operations that are not natively supported by the target. This covers both libcalls provided by libc (or libm), and builtins provided by compiler runtime libraries like libgcc, compiler-rt or compiler-builtins.</p>

<p>There are two sources of truth for this, TargetLibraryInfo (TLI) and RuntimeLibcalls. The former is used by the middle-end, primarily to recognize and optimize C library calls (this mostly covers only libc, but not libgcc). The latter is used by the backend, primarily to determine which libcalls may be emitted by the compiler and how they are spelled (this covers libgcc, and the subset of libc covered by LLVM intrinsics).</p>

<p>A problem with RuntimeLibcalls is that it currently largely works off only the target triple, which means that we have to make “lowest common denominator” assumptions about which libcalls are available, where the lowest common denominator is usually libgcc. If <code>--rtlib=compiler-rt</code> is used, LLVM does not actually know about that, and cannot make use of functions that are in compiler-rt but not libgcc.</p>

<p>This also means that we’re missing a customization point for other runtime libraries. For example, there is no way for Rust to say that it provides f128 suffix libcalls via compiler-builtins, overriding target-specific naming and availability assumptions based on which type <code>long double</code> in C maps to.</p>

<p>There is a lot of ongoing work in this area (by arsenm), so the situation here will hopefully improve in the near-ish future.</p>

<h3 id="context--module-dichotomy">Context / module dichotomy</h3>

<p>LLVM has two high-level data holders. A module corresponds to a compilation unit (e.g. pre-LTO, a single file in C/C++). The LLVM context holds various “global” data. There’s usually one context per thread, and multiple modules can (in principle) use a single context.</p>

<p>Things like functions and globals go into the module, while constants and types go into the context. The module also contains a data layout, which provides important type layout information like “how wide is a pointer”.</p>

<p>The fact that constants and types do not have access to the data layout is a constant source of friction. If you have a type, you cannot reliably tell its size without threading an extra parameter through everything. We have subsystems (like ConstantFold vs. ConstantFolding) that are separated entirely by whether data layout is available or not.</p>

<p>At the same time, I feel like this split is not actually buying us a lot. Having shared types and constants is somewhat convenient when it comes to module linking, because they can be directly shared, but I think performing explicit remapping in that one place would be better than having complexity everywhere else. Additionally, this would also allow cross-context linking, which is currently only possible by going through a bitcode roundtrip. In theory, the context could also allow some memory reuse when compiling multiple modules, but I think in practice there is usually a one-to-one correspondence between those.</p>

<h3 id="licm-register-pressure">LICM register pressure</h3>

<p>This is getting a bit down in the weeds, but I’ll mention it anyway due to how often I’ve run across this in recent times.</p>

<p>LLVM considers loop invariant code motion (LICM) to be a canonicalization transform. This means that we always hoist instructions out of loops, without any target specific cost modelling. However, LICM can increase the live ranges of values, which can increase register pressure, which can lead to a large amount of spills and reloads.</p>

<p>The general philosophy behind this is that LICM hoists everything, all middle-end transforms can work with nicely loop invariant instructions, and then instructions will get sunk back into the loop by the backend, which can precisely model register pressure.</p>

<p>Except… that second part doesn’t actually happen. I believe that (for non-PGO builds) instructions only get sunk back into loops either through rematerialization in the register allocator, or specialized sinking (typically of addressing modes), but for anything not falling into those buckets, no attempt to sink into loops in order to reduce register pressure is made.</p>

<h2 id="other">Other</h2>

<p>This list is not exhaustive. There’s more I could mention, but we’d get into increasingly narrow territory. I hope I covered most of the more important things – please do let me know what I missed!</p>

<p dir="auto"><strong>Zen C</strong> is a modern systems programming language that compiles to human-readable <code>GNU C</code>/<code>C11</code>. It provides a rich feature set including type inference, pattern matching, generics, traits, async/await, and manual memory management with RAII capabilities, all while maintaining 100% C ABI compatibility.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2025/12/ozempic-changing-foods-americans-buy">https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2025/12/ozempic-changing-foods-americans-buy</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46587536">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span>When Americans begin taking appetite-suppressing drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy, the changes extend well beyond the bathroom scale. According to new research, the medications are associated with meaningful reductions in how much households spend on food, both at the grocery store and at restaurants.</span></p><p><span>The study,&nbsp;</span><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00222437251412834"><span>published Dec. 18</span></a><span> in the&nbsp;Journal of Marketing Research, links survey data on GLP-1 receptor agonist use – a class of drugs originally developed for diabetes and now widely prescribed for weight loss – with detailed transaction records from tens of thousands of U.S. households. The result is one of the most comprehensive looks yet at how GLP-1 adoption is associated with changes in everyday food purchasing in the real world.</span></p><p><span>The headline finding is striking: Within six months of starting a GLP-1 medication, households reduce grocery spending by an average of 5.3%. Among higher-income households, the drop is even steeper, at more than 8%. Spending at fast-food restaurants, coffee shops and other limited-service eateries falls by about 8%.</span></p><p><span>Among households who continue using the medication, lower food spending persists at least a year, though the magnitude of the reduction becomes smaller over time, say co-authors, assistant professor&nbsp;</span><a href="https://business.cornell.edu/faculty-research/faculty/sh2596/"><span>Sylvia Hristakeva</span></a><span> and professor&nbsp;</span><a href="https://business.cornell.edu/faculty-research/faculty/jl2545/"><span>Jura Liaukonyte</span></a><span>,&nbsp;both in the Charles H. Dyson School of Applied Economics and Management in the Cornell SC Johnson College of Business.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“The data show clear changes in food spending following adoption,” Hristakeva said. “After discontinuation, the effects become smaller and harder to distinguish from pre-adoption spending patterns.”</span></p><p><span>Unlike previous studies that relied on self-reported eating habits, the new analysis draws on purchase data collected by Numerator, a market research firm that tracks grocery and restaurant transactions for a nationally representative panel of about 150,000 households. The researchers matched those records with repeated surveys asking whether household members were taking GLP-1 drugs, when they started and why.</span></p><p><span>That combination allowed the team to compare adopters with similar households that did not use the drugs, isolating changes that occurred after medication began.</span></p><p><span>The reductions were not evenly distributed across the grocery store.</span></p><p><span>Ultra-processed, calorie-dense foods – the kinds most closely associated with cravings – saw the sharpest declines. Spending on savory snacks dropped by about 10%, with similarly large decreases in sweets, baked goods and cookies. Even staples like bread, meat and eggs declined.</span></p><p><span>Only a handful of categories showed increases. Yogurt rose the most, followed by fresh fruit, nutrition bars and meat snacks.</span></p><p><span>“The main pattern is a reduction in overall food purchases. Only a small number of categories show increases, and those increases are modest relative to the overall decline,” Hristakeva said.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The effects extended beyond the supermarket. Spending at limited-service restaurants such as fast-food chains and coffee shops fell sharply as well.</span></p><p><span>The study also sheds light on who is taking GLP-1 medications. The share of U.S. households reporting at least one user rose from about 11% in late 2023 to more than 16% by mid-2024. Weight-loss users skew younger and wealthier, while those taking the drugs for diabetes are older and more evenly distributed across income groups.</span></p><p><span>Notably, about one-third of users stopped taking the medication during the study period. When they did, their food spending reverted to pre-adoption levels – and their grocery baskets became slightly less healthy than before they started, driven in part by increased spending on categories such as candy and chocolate.</span></p><p><span>That movement underscores an important limitation, the authors caution. The study cannot fully separate the biological effects of the drugs from other lifestyle changes users may make at the same time. However, evidence from clinical trials, combined with the observed reversion in spending after discontinuation, suggests appetite suppression is likely a key mechanism behind the spending changes.</span></p><p><span>The findings carry implications far beyond individual households.</span></p><p><span>For food manufacturers, restaurants and retailers, widespread GLP-1 adoption could mean long-term shifts in demand, particularly for snack foods and fast food. Package sizes, product formulations and marketing strategies may need to change. For policymakers and public-health experts, the results add context to ongoing debates about the role of medical treatments in shaping dietary behavior – and whether biologically driven appetite changes succeed where taxes and labels have struggled.</span></p><p><span>“At current adoption rates, even relatively modest changes at the household level can have meaningful aggregate effects,” Hristakeva said. “Understanding these demand shifts is therefore important for assessing food markets and consumer spending.”&nbsp;</span></p></div></div>]]></description>

<h2 id="building-it">Building it</h2>
<p>I think we’ve all been there, <strong>your build fails in Actions, but the script works fine locally.</strong> You now settle into a slow loop of:</p>
<ol>
<li>Push speculative change</li>
<li>See if it worked</li>
</ol>
<p>It was in the middle of one of these when I started thinking about how to make it better.</p>
<p>A Terminal would be great, that’s obvious, but how to make it happen? How could I make it free, and open to anyone, without costing me lots of money?</p>
<p>Operating a service that forward traffic between a user and the Actions VM would stack up data transfer costs and take some work to scale.</p>
<p>What about a Peer-to-Peer connection? I’d recently been going deeper on how <a href="https://tailscale.com/blog/how-tailscale-works">Tailscale</a>, <a href="https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh">iroh</a> and <a href="https://webrtc.org/">WebRTC</a> use <a href="https://tailscale.com/blog/how-nat-traversal-works">UDP Hole Punching to create Peer-to-Peer (P2P) connections</a> between nodes without relaying traffic. <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>If that worked then my server would only need to exchange a tiny bit of information per session and hopefully cost me very little 🤞</p>
<p>Could I use P2P and funnel a terminal session over it? Well the Actions VM is on the internet and allows UDP outbound, so it should work!</p>
<p>A simple bit of scripting proved it did 🥳 With WebRTC, if the Actions VM and my local machine exchange information about their connectivity (<a href="https://webrtc.org/getting-started/peer-connections#ice_candidates">ICE Candidates</a>), then I could form a connection.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="security-and-identities">Security and Identities</h2>
<p>The next problem is, <strong>how do you prove each end of the P2P connection is who they say they are?</strong></p>
<p>It’s important. I want to ensure that <code>lawrencegripper</code> can only access terminals for Actions triggered by <code>lawrencegripper</code>.</p>
<p>The browser side is relatively easy, we can use OAuth to login via GitHub and get a verified username ✅</p>
<p>On the Actions VM <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/concepts/security/openid-connect">we have OIDC</a>, commonly used to auth from Actions to cloud providers.</p>
<p>Anyone can use it though, it gives us the ability to issue a signed OIDC token from within our Action which proves:</p>
<ol>
<li>The repo it’s running on</li>
<li>The user account that triggered it</li>
<li>The audience it is intended for</li>
</ol>
<p>To enable this feature you set the following permissions in the workflow</p>

<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="yaml"><span><span><span>    </span><span>permissions</span><span>:</span><span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span>      </span><span>id-token</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>write</span></span></span></code></pre></div>

<p>You request a token via a REST request in the action, for example:</p>

<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="typescript"><span><span>    <span>const</span> <span>requestURL</span> <span>=</span> <span>process</span><span>.</span><span>env</span><span>.</span><span>ACTIONS_ID_TOKEN_REQUEST_URL</span><span>;</span>

</span></span><span><span>        <span>Authorization</span><span>:</span> <span>`Bearer </span><span>${</span><span>requestToken</span><span>}</span><span>`</span><span>,</span>
</span></span><span><span>        <span>Accept</span><span>:</span> <span>'application/json'</span><span>,</span>

<p>Then, when the Action calls our server, it can include this token. We can then validate it cryptographically via JWKS:</p>

<h2 id="connecting-the-peers-ie-signaling-server">Connecting the Peers (ie. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API/Connectivity#signaling">Signaling Server</a>)</h2>
<p>At this point we know:</p>
<ol>
<li>We can create a connection between two peers (Actions VM &lt;-&gt; Users Browser) with WebRTC</li>
<li>We have a way to validate the identity of both ends of the connection (OAuth and OIDC)</li>
</ol>
<p>What’s left is the server to introduce the two peers 🤝 Let’s build a server to do that.</p>
<p>The server doesn’t need to handle the terminal data, that goes between the two peers directly, it’s only doing introductions.</p>
<p>When the VM and Browser are connected to the server it should send each one the connection details for the other.</p>
<p>To do this, the browser and the VM both create <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events">Server-sent events (SSE)</a> connections, allowing the signaling server to push events to them. They prove their identities by providing their OAuth credentials or OIDC to prove their identity.</p>
<p>The server then stores:</p>

<p>The server then, via SSE, sends the Actions VM connectivity details to the browser and the Browser’s connectivity details to the Actions VM.</p>
<p>At this point they establish the Peer-to-Peer connection 🥳</p>
<p>For bonus points, when a new Actions VM connects, I can see if a browser is open waiting and send them a notification.</p>

<p>Ok, we’re close now. We have the signaling server to exchange details and then the peers have a p2p connection.</p>
<p>What about creating a terminal and streaming the data?</p>
<p>WebRTC has a <code>datachannel</code> which you push arbitrary data through.</p>

<p>In the browser we then need to display an interactive terminal.</p>
<p>Reading around, I found the this awesome <a href="https://github.com/coder/ghostty-web">Ghostty library</a>. It has an xterm.js compatible implementation, I hooked this up and it worked first time 🥰</p>
<p>Well it did.. and it didn’t, the Terminal spawned via PTY doesn’t have any idea how big our terminal in the browser (Lines and Columns) so we get some horrible rendering in the terminal.</p>
<p>With a bit of poking, googling and some Opus 4.5, I created a method which estimates the size of terminal, via font sizing, and converts this to a rough column / rows. Then, on establishing the P2P connection I can send a <code>setup</code> JSON message which the Actions VM uses to start <code>pty.spawn</code> with the right sizing for the terminal.</p>

<p>There is a lot of trust placed in the signaling server. It has to do the right thing, or it could provide access to someone else’s Actions VM.</p>
<p>Let’s do better.</p>
<h2 id="trust-vs-zero-trust">Trust vs Zero-Trust</h2>
<p>I’ve mentioned already <strong>the signaling server should only connect up users with actions they’ve started</strong>.</p>
<p>That relies on explicit trust, from users, that I’m going to do the right thing.</p>
<p>What if I’ve got a bug? What if someone compromises the signaling server? What if they steal the domain and run their own server on it?</p>
<p>Well, then they could hook up peers that shouldn’t be connected and … do mean things.</p>
<p>That sounds bad, lets work out how to fix that.</p>
<p>What if the <code>user</code> provided the Actions VM with a secret, that only they know?</p>
<p>When the P2P connection is made, the Actions VM could refuse to talk to the browser until it provides the right secret.</p>
<p>Secrets are cool and everything but if they’re intercepted they’re reusable, could we use a One-Time-Password (OTP) commonly used for 2FA on sites? Sure thing! Even better tools like 1Password will autofill it for you.</p>
<p>What does this flow look like? Roughly it’s 👇</p>

<p>Even if the signaling server is manipulated, to hook up two peers which shouldn’t be connected, the user won’t be able to execute commands unless they can provide a valid OTP.</p>
<p>Better still the Signaling server (which I run) is never sent either the OTP or the OTP Secret used to validate each OTP.</p>
<p>This validation happens between two peers you own (Actions VM and your Browser).</p>
<h2 id="so-now-were-done">So now we’re done?</h2>
<p>One last thing… make the signaling server cheap to host.</p>
<p>I want to offer this for free for anyone to use. It’s a simple <code>go</code> binary in a docker image (to make it easy to self-hosting and test locally) but it needs to live on the internet.</p>
<p>A while ago I’d started poking at <a href="https://railway.com/">railway.com</a>, it’s cloud with a big billing twist, <strong>you only pay for the CPU and Memory you actually use</strong>. This felt like a great time to try it out.</p>
<p>How is the billing different, well…</p>
<ul>
<li>In Azure/AWS I have to say “I want 2 CPUs and 8GB” and I pay for that regardless of what I use.</li>
<li>On <a href="https://railway.com/">railway.com</a> I say “Use <strong>up to</strong> x CPUs and y GB” then you only pay for what the service actually consumes.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: In either Azure/AWS or Railway you still pay network egress.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How does this work out for the signaling server?</p>
<p><strong>Really well</strong> it’s peak memory usage so far is 20MB, racking up a mean $0.00000… you get the point. It’s not costing much, as I’m not reserving a small machine with GBs of mem to run a service needing 20MB</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.gripdev.xyz/2026/01/10/actions-terminal-on-failure-for-debugging/memory-usage.png" alt="Graph showing 20mb of memory"></p>
<p>Even then it feels a bit wasteful running it all the time. There will be chunks of time when folks aren’t using it.</p>
<p>This was where I found a platform feature called <a href="https://docs.railway.com/reference/app-sleeping">sleeping</a>, it’s serverless but without the pain of moving away from the docker model to some proprietary runtime.</p>
<p>When the service isn’t doing anything, Railway spin down the service. If someone turns up, they hold the connection for a moment while restoring the container, then send the request through.</p>
<p>What does a cold start look like on our simple signalling server? It’s hardly recognizable.</p>
<p>Here is a recording, on the left you see the server is sleeping and on the right I hit the domain, there is a slight pause before the page renders ✨</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://archaeologist.dev/artifacts/anthropic">https://archaeologist.dev/artifacts/anthropic</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46586766">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Anthropic may have just committed the biggest business blunder of 2026 -- and we're less than two weeks in. To understand why, let's briefly rewind to 2025, the year when agentic AI went mainstream.</p>
<p>On 3 February 2025, Andrej Karpathy <a href="https://x.com/karpathy/status/1886192184808149383?s=20">coined the term "vibe coding"</a> to describe the new paradigm.</p>
<p>Less than three weeks later, Anthropic <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-7-sonnet">released the first research preview of Claude Code</a>, bringing large language models directly into developers' native habitat: the terminal.</p>
<p>OpenAI <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/16/openai-debuts-codex-cli-an-open-source-coding-tool-for-terminals/">followed with Codex CLI</a> in April, and Google released <a href="https://blog.google/innovation-and-ai/technology/developers-tools/introducing-gemini-cli-open-source-ai-agent/">Gemini CLI</a> in June.</p>
<p>All of these terminal-based coding agents follow the same principle:</p>
<ol>
<li>you type a prompt</li>
<li>the agent sends it to a large language model</li>
<li>the LLM responds and may instruct the agent to carry out actions like editing files or running commands</li>
<li>the agent carries out the actions and appends the results to the prompt</li>
</ol>
<p>These steps are repeated in a loop, but with a twist: the agent can continue working through the loop until the LLM decides that it requires user input.</p>
<p>The principle is so simple that it immediately gave rise to a bunch of alternative coding agents, including OpenCode, Roo, and Amp Code (to name but a few).
Each brought its own unique philosophy and approach to the table, but what they all have in common is that they ultimately rely on large language models for intelligence.
Their job is purely to collect user input, execute tool calls, and pass those to the model, over and over again.
Therefore, they tend to provide a way to select from a predefined set of models and a means of authenticating with the relevant providers (such as Anthropic or OpenAI),
generally using an API key.</p>
<p>When Claude Code launched for real in June 2025, usage of the Anthropic models was <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/anthropics-popular-claude-code-ai-tool-now-included-with-its-20month-pro-plan/">included</a> in the Pro and Max plans, for a flat monthly or annual subscription.
These plans quickly became very popular when users realised that the effective cost per token was much lower compared to Anthropic's API pricing.
So popular, in fact, that it <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/anthropic-acquires-bun-as-claude-code-reaches-usd1b-milestone">reached $1 billion in annualised revenue</a> after only six months.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, OpenCode rapidly gained popularity, <a href="http://archive.today/OftjM">amassing</a> over 50,000 GitHub stars and more than 650,000 monthly active users in the same short timeframe.
One of its key selling points was the ability to "Log in with Anthropic to use your Claude Pro or Max account", thus enabling developers to benefit from the attractive Claude subscription pricing.
In contrast, other coding agents such as Amp only provided the ability to connect to Claude models via the much more expensive pay-per-token API.</p>
<p>It turns out that logging into third-party coding agents with an Anthropic OAuth token was a bit of a loophole. This was evident from the fact that it would only work if the client-supplied system prompt contained a specific phrase <a href="https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode/issues/417">identifying itself as Claude Code</a>. Nevertheless, many (presumably) unsuspecting Anthropic customers used OpenCode in this way; from their perspective, they were simply using the same service that they were already paying for, just in the comfort of their preferred coding harness.</p>
<p>However, Anthropic clearly didn't see it this way. On 9 January 2026, Anthropic unceremoniously closed the loophole, changing their API to detect and reject requests from third-party clients. The renowned vibe-coder Peter Steinberger soon <a href="https://x.com/steipete">posted</a> about it on the website formerly known as Twitter, and disgruntled Anthropic customers <a href="https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/17118">expressed their discontent</a> in a GitHub issue, requesting the decision to be reversed, many threatening to cancel their Claude subscription otherwise.</p>
<p>It's notable that Anthropic has not formally announced this change in ToS enforcement, neither ahead of time nor after the fact. The only quasi-announcement of this change was <a href="https://x.com/trq212/status/2009689809875591565">this thread</a>, posted by an Anthropic employee on their personal account the day after the changes took effect, presumably in response to customer complaints. The stated motivation for the change was the allegation that "third-party harnesses using Claude subscriptions create problems for users and generate unusual traffic patterns [...] making it really hard for us to help debug when they have questions about rate limit usage or account bans and they don’t have any other avenue for this support."</p>
<p>I will leave it to the reader to decide for themselves whether they consider this a credible explanation or not; frankly, it doesn't matter. The truth is that Anthropic is free to put whatever they want into their ToS, and customers have to abide by it or leave. It appears quite a few have opted for the latter. However, what does matter is what Anthropic has implicitly revealed through its actions last Friday:</p>
<ol>
<li>Anthropic is willing to go to war with their paying customers over a trivial ToS violation, and</li>
<li>they really, really want to own the entire value chain rather than being relegated to becoming just another "model provider", and</li>
<li>they utterly failed to consider the second-order effects of this business decision.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first point has received ample discussion already, so I want to focus on the second and third points.</p>
<p>It was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2026/jan/07/ai-anthropic-funding-valuation">reported</a> just a few days earlier that Anthropic has signed a term sheet to raise $10bn at a humongous $350bn valuation. Related or not, the incentives are clear. Model-agnostic harnesses such as OpenCode present a real threat to Anthropic. Whilst its models are incredibly popular in the software developer community and it has made big inroads in enterprise LLM usage, the Claude chatbot itself reportedly commands a market share of... wait for it... <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/ai-chatbot-market-share">1.07%</a>. So it's no surprise that they are trying to avoid being commoditized in their core market.</p>
<p>Which brings us to the final point: without anticipating it, Anthropic just found itself in a classic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma">prisoner's dilemma</a> with OpenAI -- and OpenAI just <a href="https://x.com/thsottiaux/status/2009742187484065881?s=20">defected</a>. Not only are they officially supporting OpenCode users to use their Codex subscriptions and usage limits in OpenCode, they are <a href="https://x.com/thsottiaux/status/2010064438033104966">extending the same support</a> to other open-source coding harnesses such as OpenHands, RooCode, and Pi. And it's not just a theoretical announcement either: support for connecting ChatGPT Pro/Plus subscriptions with OpenCode has already <a href="https://x.com/thdxr/status/2009803906461905202?s=20">shipped</a>.</p>
<p>What are we to take away from all this?</p>
<p>For me personally, I have decided I will never be an Anthropic customer, because I refuse to do business with a company that takes its customers for granted. Beyond my personal choices, though, I predict that the folks at Anthropic will come to regret their actions last week. By cracking down on their own customers in a vain attempt to quash healthy competition, they have destroyed a lot of goodwill and <a href="https://x.com/archeologistdev/status/2009763760748278110?s=20">gave their main rival an opening that was ripe for the picking</a>. Whilst they have plenty of cash in the bank for now, they will eventually need to learn to treat their customers with respect if they are to survive in the ever-more-competitive LLM provider landscape.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><img src="https://cdn.lightpanda.io/website/assets/images/blog/authors/karl_seguin.png" alt="Karl Seguin"></p><div><h3>Karl Seguin</h3><h4>Software Engineer</h4></div></div><figure><img src="https://cdn.lightpanda.io/website/assets/images/blog/posts/migrating-our-dom-to-zig/migratingdomtozig_large.png" alt="Migrating our DOM to Zig"></figure><h2 id="tldr">TL;DR<a href="#tldr" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h2>
<p>We replaced LibDOM with our own Zig-based DOM implementation. The original design created friction between V8, our Zig layer, and LibDOM, especially around events, Custom Elements, and ShadowDOM. After six months of spare-time prototyping, we built zigdom: a leaner, more cohesive DOM that gives us full control over memory, events, and future enhancements. We also swapped in html5ever for parsing and added V8 snapshots to cut startup time. There are single-digit % performance gains, but the real win is a unified codebase that’s easier to extend.</p>
<h2 id="why-we-replaced-libdom">Why We Replaced LibDOM<a href="#why-we-replaced-libdom" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h2>
<p>At a high level, the Lightpanda codebase can be described as a Zig layer sitting between V8 and LibDOM. When JavaScript is executed, like , V8 calls into the Zig layer which then forwards the request to the underlying LibDOM document object and then forwards the result back to V8. By using LibDOM, we gained a robust and fairly comprehensive DOM implementation with minimal effort.</p>
<p>However, as we worked to increase compatibility with websites in the wild, we felt ever-increasing friction between our three layers. One example is the event system baked into LibDOM. This proved awkward to expand beyond DOM-based events (e.g. input events) or even just bubbling DOM events to our Zig-based Window implementation. Another larger challenge, was integrating support for Custom Elements and ShadowDOM, written in Zig, with LibDOM. Finally, there was some concern about the lack of cohesion with respect to things like memory management and how that would impact potential future changes, like better multi-threading support.</p>
<p>If we were to restart the integration from scratch, knowing what we know now, we’d probably be able to avoid most of the friction we’re currently seeing. While we do modify LibDOM as needed, one approach would be to integrate V8 and LibDOM directly, applying fixes and additions directly to LibDOM. But as we wrote before, we’re <a href="https://lightpanda.io/blog/posts/why-we-built-lightpanda-in-zig" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">fans of Zig<!-- --> <svg fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="1.7" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="1em"><path d="M7 17L17 7"></path><path d="M7 7h10v10"></path></svg></a> so the discussions and prototypes we built always leaned towards replacing LibDOM with a custom Zig implementation.</p>
<h3 id="zigdom">zigdom<a href="#zigdom" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h3>
<p>Work on a prototype for having a Zig-based DOM started roughly six months ago. This was a casual in-our-spare-time effort. In the spirit of experimentation, this prototype also replaced V8 with <a href="https://github.com/quickjs-ng/quickjs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">QuickJS-NG<!-- --> <svg fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="1.7" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="1em"><path d="M7 17L17 7"></path><path d="M7 7h10v10"></path></svg></a>. By mid-November, we felt the prototype had tackled enough unknowns to start integrating it into Lightpanda (with V8). Thankfully, porting features was relatively simple; commits to the  branch could usually be ported to the  branch.</p>
<p>The design is straightforward. A  has a linked list of children and an optional . Furthermore, a  has a  tagged union field to represent the type of node, and a  field to capture its supertype:</p>

<p>Since a modern website can have tens of thousands of nodes and thousands of elements, we obviously care about the size of our ,  and . That’s why every type in our union is a pointer. That means that when we create a div, we need to allocate the Div, HTMLElement, Element, Node and EventTarget. But rather than doing five separate allocations, we do 1 large allocation for the total size and parcel it out.</p>
<p>Another area where we’ve been able to optimize for our use-case is to lazily parse/load certain properties. While a website might have thousands of elements, most JavaScript will only access the classes, styles, relLists, dataset, etc, of a few elements. Rather than having these stored on each element, even as empty lazily loaded containers, they’re attached to a page in an element -&gt; property lookup. While this adds lookup overhead, it removes ~6 pointers from every element.</p>
<p>The real win is having a more cohesive design for events, custom elements and ShadowDOM and a simpler foundation for future enhancements. That said, performance, both in terms of memory usage and CPU load are slightly improved (both single digit % improvements).</p>
<h3 id="html5ever">html5ever<a href="#html5ever" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h3>
<p>We saw benefits to writing our own DOM implementation, but not our own HTML parser. For that, we turned to <a href="https://servo.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">servo’s<!-- --> <svg fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="1.7" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="1em"><path d="M7 17L17 7"></path><path d="M7 7h10v10"></path></svg></a> <a href="https://github.com/servo/html5ever" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">html5ever<!-- --> <svg fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="1.7" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="1em"><path d="M7 17L17 7"></path><path d="M7 7h10v10"></path></svg></a> written in Rust. I almost forgot to mention it in this post because the experience was so painless and worked from the get-go that I haven’t had to think about it for a while. You setup html5ever with a bunch of callbacks (for creating a node, attaching a node to a parent, creating text, etc.), feed it your HTML, and away you go. My Rust is very bad, but writing a C binding for it was manageable.</p>
<h3 id="bonus---v8-snapshot">Bonus - V8 Snapshot<a href="#bonus---v8-snapshot" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h3>
<p>Some of the porting was tedious. For a change of pace, I took time to see how we could leverage V8 snapshots. As a short summary, whenever you create a V8 environment to execute code, you have to do a lot of setup. Every type (hundreds) with all the functions and properties need to be registered with the V8 environment. For a simple page, this can represent anywhere from 10-30% of the total time. V8 snapshots let you setup a pseudo-environment upfront, extract a Snapshot (a binary blob), and use that blob to bootstrap and speedup future environments.</p>
<p>When in debug mode, we generated the snapshot on startup. In release mode, the snapshot is generated at compile-time and embedded into the binary, reducing startup time and memory. The overall impact depends on the relative cost of setting up the environment vs processing the page. Complex websites that load hundreds of external scripts probably won’t benefit. But incremental improvements hopefully add up and, if nothing else, help balance the performance cost of new features and complexity.</p>
<h3 id="ai-coding-agent">AI Coding Agent<a href="#ai-coding-agent" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h3>
<p>This was the first large feature that I developed with the aid of an AI coding agent - specifically Claude. The experience was positive, but not flawless. I’ve personally always liked participating in code reviews / PRs. I can spend hours every day reviewing PRs, so working with Claude is kind of fun for me. If reading code isn’t something you consider fun, it could be a frustrating experience.</p>
<p>I was almost always impressed with the quality of code written and “understanding” that Claude exhibited. I’m only guessing here, but I have to imagine that building a DOM, something which has a very explicit specification, tons of documentation and many implementations, was an ideal task for a coding agent.</p>
<p>That said, I do think this is first and foremost a code-review exercise, and the Claude CLI is lacking in that respect. When you’re trying to understand and think through a change, you need a comfortable interface that lets you navigate and access whatever context you’re missing. Anything more than a few lines becomes challenging to review, especially as it’s presented for you to accept one piece at a time.</p>
<p>In the end, it’s a tool that supplements my own abilities.</p>
<h2 id="whats-next">What’s Next<a href="#whats-next" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h2>
<p>Implementing our own DOM from scratch should make it easier for us to add new features and enhancements. Something we’ve already seen with better custom element and ShadowRoot support. Much of the benefits don’t come directly from implementing a new DOM, but by simply having a more cohesive codebase. For us, expanding our usage of Zig made the most sense.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="articleBody">
<p>I have not been shy talking about <a href="https://rubenerd.com/tag/xfce/">my love</a> of <a href="https://xfce.org/">Xfce</a> over the years here. The desktop environment has been a trusted friend ever since I first loved it on the late Cobind Desktop (still the high water mark of desktop Linux, as far as I’m concerned).</p>
<p>I’m glad to see I’m not the only one. David Gerard of <a href="https://pivot-to-ai.com/">Pivot to AI</a> fame recently shared <a href="https://reddragdiva.dreamwidth.org/582674.html">this post he wrote in 2012</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The question with minimal desktops is the fine line between as simple as possible and just a bit too simple. How much basic stuff do you have to add back? 4.8 took it slightly far, 4.10 is almost Just Right. XFCE is so far a case study in Not Fucking It Up; I hope they never go to version 5, and just update 4 forever.</p></blockquote>
<p>This (a) longevity and (2) getting the balance right cannot be overstated. Here’s my current Xfce desktop, for example:</p>
<figure><p><img src="https://rubenerd.com/files/2026/xfce2008@1x.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://rubenerd.com/files/2026/xfce2008@2x.jpg 2x"></p></figure>
<p>Except, <strong>no it isn’t</strong>. That’s a screenshot of my <a href="https://rubenerd.com/p1185/" title="Fun with Xfce, part one">FreeBSD desktop from 2008</a>, with the bright and clear Tango Iconset (speaking of high-water marks). Remember when iconography was discernable at a glance? Aka, functional as icons? But I digress.</p>
<p>Xfce in 2025 (no, 2026, damn it!) is just as easy to understand, light, and fast as it first was booting Cobind on my <a href="http://retro.rubenerd.com/brio.htm">HP Brio</a> when I was in school, or when building it from source in FreeBSD ports. Though unlike a barebones window manager or other “light” DEs, Xfce feels usable, feature complete, and designed by someone who understands why people use desktop computers (cough GNOME).</p>
<p>I do use KDE on my primary desktop. Version 4 was a mess, but they’ve made <em>massive</em> improvements, especially within the last year. I’m not sure how much this had to do with the Steam Deck, and a new generation of people realising that… wait… I can run stuff on this box other than games? There’s a desktop here!? But my laptops all run Xfce, and I’m half-tempted to move back to it on the desktop.</p>
<p>I’m with David here. I hope they never feel the need to “innovate” with “disruption” for “UX”. The switch to the Thunar file manager was the last major user-facing change I can remember, and it was great.</p>
<p>I’m not suggesting we reached peak UI with Xfce, but no desktop since has made a compelling case (for me) for its replacement. I love, <em>love</em>, <strong>love</strong> that Xfce is maintained this way in spite of all the industry pressures to turn it into something else.</p>
<h3 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h3>
<p>I stopped writing posts like this for years, out of fear of how people from specific desktop environments would respond. If you’re about to write me an angry screed, know that I will immediately delete it and block you, <a href="https://rubenerd.com/people-who-need-to-run-windows/" title="A thread about people who need to run Windows">just as I did last time</a>. Both yours and my time are better spent.</p>
<p>I also know (sigh) this disclaimer will be ignored, so I’m questioning why I’m even bothering. Maybe I’m a sucker for punishment.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>Claude Code and Claude Opus 4.5 have poured fuel on the hype. LLM tools existed before, but they’re better than ever now, so a lot more people are paying attention. But we’re not entering a golden age of SaaS. We’re entering an era of personal, disposable software—where engineering shifts from writing code to shaping systems, and engineers are still required for exactly that reason.</p>
<h2>The Shift in Modern Development</h2>
<p><strong>Claude Code</strong> is taking over my feed right now, and for good reason. What’s interesting isn’t just that developers are jumping on it—it’s that <strong>"builders" and makers</strong> who previously relied on platforms like Lovable or Replit are migrating to it.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, those tools are still perfectly viable for shipping fast. But we’re seeing a clear shift as people rediscover the inherent beauty of a <strong>CLI-first workflow</strong>. When you move the interaction into the <strong>terminal</strong>, the abstraction layer thins out. You aren't just following a managed UI's happy path; you're the one in control.</p>
<hr>
<h2>The collapse of the barrier to entry</h2>
<p>What are people actually building with these tools? If you look around, the answer is: almost everything. In fact, we’ve reached a point of saturation. On one hand, we are witnessing the <strong>true democratisation of software creation</strong>. The barrier to entry has effectively collapsed. For the first time, <strong>non-developers</strong> aren't just consumers of software - they are the <strong>architects of their own tools</strong>.</p>
<p>In the past, if you had a specific problem, you’d spend hours searching for a SaaS product that solved 80% of it. Today, the workflow has shifted. People are opening a CLI or a voice interface and simply describing what they need. We’re seeing a surge in <strong>"personal software"</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>subscription tracker</strong> tailored to a specific budget style</li>
<li>A <strong>Chrome extension</strong> that solves one very niche data entry problem</li>
<li>A <strong>fitness app</strong> with an interface exactly how the user wants it</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a massive shift. <strong>Software is becoming a personal utility</strong> you generate, rather than a commodity you buy.</p>
<h2>From SaaS to Scratchpads</h2>
<p>We’re entering a new era of software development where the goal isn't always longevity. For years, the industry has been obsessed with building "platforms" and "ecosystems," but the tide is shifting toward something more ephemeral. We're moving from SaaS to scratchpads.</p>
<p>A lot of this new software isn't meant to live forever. In fact, it’s the opposite. People are increasingly building tools to solve a single, specific problem exactly once—and then discarding them. It is software as a disposable utility, designed for the immediate "now" rather than the distant "later."</p>
<p>What makes this viable today is a specific technical philosophy: CLI-first interfaces, local data, and zero onboarding. When you remove the friction of signing up, configuring a database, or navigating a complex UI, the cost of creating a tool drops so low that "temporary" becomes a feature, not a bug. If it takes five minutes to spin up a custom solution for a one-off task, you don't need it to persist.</p>
<p>The contrast with the traditional SaaS model is stark. SaaS is inherently built to optimize for retention, lock-in, and expansion. It’s a business model designed to keep you inside the ecosystem and growing your footprint. Bespoke tools, on the other hand, optimize for immediacy and control. They don't care about your lifetime value as a customer; they only care about solving the task at hand.</p>
<p>In many ways, this is a return to how spreadsheets were originally used. You didn't open a spreadsheet to build a permanent, multi-year database; you used it as a scratchpad to reason through a problem, calculate the results, and move on.</p>
<p>In this new landscape, Claude Code is Excel for developers—a powerful, flexible utility for solving immediate problems—rather than Shopify for founders, which is built to be a permanent foundation for a business. It’s about getting the job done, and then letting the tool go.</p>
<p>This also explains why the next part matters: generating software quickly is one thing; making it survive contact with the real world is another.</p>
<h2><strong>Code Is Cheap. Software Is Still Expensive.</strong></h2>
<p>Here is the reality of the current "AI-native" era: code has become cheap, but software remains incredibly expensive.</p>
<p>LLMs have effectively killed the cost of generating lines of code, but they haven’t touched the cost of truly understanding a problem. We’re seeing a flood of "apps built in a weekend," but most of these are just thin wrappers around basic CRUD operations and third-party APIs. They look impressive in a Twitter demo, but they often crumble the moment they hit the friction of the real world.</p>
<p>The real cost of software isn’t the initial write; it’s the maintenance, the edge cases, the mounting UX debt, and the complexities of data ownership. These "fast" solutions are brittle.</p>
<p>The subscription tracker breaks the moment a bank changes its CSV export format. The Chrome extension dies the second a target website’s DOM shifts. The fitness app becomes unusable as soon as a user needs robust offline support or reliable data sync.</p>
<p>Lately, I’ve seen plenty of doomsaying on Hacker News, Reddit, and Twitter about "the end of software engineering." This misses the point entirely. We aren't witnessing the end of the profession; we’re entering a new era of it.</p>
<p>The value of an engineer is shifting away from the "how" of syntax and toward the "what" and "why" of systems. Real engineering lies in the abstractions and the architecture. It’s about knowing how to structure a system that lasts, understanding why a specific rate-limiting strategy is necessary, knowing how to manage a distributed cache, and knowing exactly where <em>not</em> to store your environment variables.</p>
<p>AI often feels powerful because it hides the complexity, but as an engineer, your job is to manage that complexity, not ignore it. The tools have changed, but the fundamental requirement for engineering rigour has never been higher.</p>
<h2>The distribution illusion</h2>
<p>But there is a flip side. With the barrier to entry gone, the <strong>noise level</strong> has reached an all-time high. My feeds are currently flooded with <strong>"AI entrepreneurs"</strong> claiming <strong>five-figure monthly recurring revenue (MRR)</strong> for apps they built in an afternoon.</p>
<p>In many cases, these claims are highly suspect. When you see a creator with no existing distribution and no clear <span><strong>"moat"</strong></span> claiming $10,000 in MRR on a weekend project, it’s usually a play for engagement rather than a reflection of business reality.</p>
<p>Some of these stories are almost certainly true but in most cases, these aren't actually blueprints for technical innovation. They are marketing case studies. These individuals succeed because they have mastered the art of capturing attention in a crowded landscape, not just because they have an AI co-pilot.</p>
<p>We’ve entered an era where the ability to generate code is no longer the bottleneck. The <strong>real challenge has shifted to distribution</strong> and, more importantly, distinguishing the <strong>genuine utility</strong> from the "get-rich-quick" posturing that has become so prevalent in the industry.</p>
<p>These people haven't stumbled upon a secret shortcut; they have simply found a way to execute their existing advantages faster (and potentially unlocked it in the first place if learning to code was rightfully too big of an undertaking for a side project idea).</p>
<p>There is a useful framing for this shift: AI has effectively removed engineering leverage as a primary differentiator. When any developer can use an LLM to build and deploy a complex feature in a fraction of the time it used to take, the ability to write code is no longer the competitive advantage it once was. It is no longer enough to just be a "builder."</p>
<p>Instead, success now hinges on factors that are much harder to automate. Taste, timing, and deep, intuitive understanding of your audience matter more than ever. You can generate a product in a weekend, but that is worthless if you are building the wrong thing or launching it to a room full of people who aren't listening.</p>
<p>In this new environment, the code has become the easy part. The hard part remains exactly what it has always been: finding a way to get people to care.</p>
<h2>Who wins</h2>
<p>First, you have domain experts who are stuck with boring, repetitive problems. Then there are the internal teams building throwaway tooling, the kind of scripts and internal apps that need to work immediately rather than look perfect. Power users also see a massive gain here, particularly when they are looking to replace brittle, manual workflows with something more robust. Finally, it is a win for those engineers who prioritise ownership of the solution over high-gloss polish.</p>
<p>And yes — tools like Claude Opus 4.5, Claude Code, and Cursor are genuinely useful for engineers. They are remarkably good at removing boilerplate, implementing features, and writing unit tests. One of my favourite use cases lately, especially since starting a new job, is generating personalised documentation and walkthroughs of features to get up to speed on the product codebase and how all the nuance works - it's been extremely helpful in getting up to speed.</p>
<p>But here is the reality: LLMs are not perfect at writing code - even if it compiles first time. Even with high quality prompting and clear rules, these models still make mistakes. Speaking as someone who uses these tools every day, you cannot simply trust the output outright. You still have to review the code as if it were a pull request from a teammate. You have to read the logic, check the assumptions, and often make manual edits to get it right.</p>
<p>After all, you'll likely be sending this to a teammate for a review (and maybe Code Rabbit I guess) - is it fair to make them review something you didn't write or even bother to check?</p>
<p>These tools help you move faster, but they do not replace the need for a critical eye or your years of experience and do not understand the overall problem space better than you.</p>
<hr>
<p>The hype makes it look like we’re entering a golden age of SaaS. We aren’t. We’re entering an era of personal software: tools you generate to solve a problem, and then move on.</p>
<p>With twenty dollars, a few hours of spare time, and a bit of patience, almost anyone can ship a functional application. We are entering the era of "personal software," where the gap between an initial idea and a working product is narrower than ever before.</p>
<p>In this new reality, engineering expertise remains incredibly valuable, but the nature of the role is shifting. Relevance is not fading. Instead, it is about leveraging these tools to build at a higher level than was previously possible. True expertise is now required to steer these systems and provide the technical oversight that LLMs currently lack.</p>
<p>While AI is undeniably good at writing code, it remains poor at architecting maintainable, distributable, and scalable systems. This is where non-technical leaders who think they can fire their development teams are making a significant mistake. Until we see the arrival of an artificial intelligence that renders this entire discussion moot, believing that technical expertise can be replaced by a prompt is a strategic error. Building robust software still requires a human who understands the underlying principles of the craft.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that while the tools have changed, the fundamentals of good engineering have not.</p>
<p>While barrier to entry may be gone - judgment, taste, and responsibility are still the job.</p>

        <p>I've been trying to think through what happens to programming languages and tooling if humans are increasingly no longer writing it. I wrote about how good agents are at <a href="https://martinalderson.com/posts/ported-photoshop-1-to-csharp-in-30-minutes/">porting code recently</a>, and it got me thinking a bit more about what constraints LLMs have vs humans.</p>
<p>One of the biggest constraints LLMs have is on context length. This is a difficult problem to solve, as memory usage rises significantly with longer context window in current transformer architectures. And with the current memory shortages, I don't think the world is drowning in memory right now.</p>
<p>As such, for software development agents, how 'token efficient' a programming language actually could make a big difference and I wonder if it starts becoming a factor in language selection in the future. Given a significant amount of a coding agents context window is going to be code, a more token efficient language should allow longer sessions and require fewer resources to deliver.</p>
<p>We've seen <a href="https://toonformat.dev/">TOON</a> (an encoding of JSON to be more token efficient), but what about programming languages?<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<h2>Methodology</h2>
<p>I came across the <a href="https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Rosetta_Code">RosettaCode</a> project while doing some research thinking around this. It describes itself a&nbsp;programming chrestomathy&nbsp;site (which I love, by the way). It has over a thousand programming 'tasks' that people build in various languages. It has contributions in nearly 1,000 different programming languages.</p>
<p>I found a <a href="https://github.com/acmeism/RosettaCodeData">GitHub mirror</a> of the dataset, so grabbed Claude Code and asked it to make a comparison of them, using the Xenova/gpt-4 tokenizer from Hugging Face - which is a community port of OpenAI's GPT4 tokenizer.</p>
<p>I then told Claude Code to suggest a selection of the most popular programming languages, which roughly matches my experience, and then find tasks that had solutions contributed in <em>all</em> 19 of these languages, and then ran them through the tokenizer. I didn't include TypeScript because there were very few tasks in the Rosetta Code dataset.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are many, many potential limits and biases involved in this dataset and approach! It's meant as a interesting look at somewhat like-for-like solutions to some programming tasks, not a scientific study.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p><img src="https://martinalderson.com/img/token-efficiency-chart.png" alt="Token efficiency comparison across programming languages"></p><blockquote>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> A lot of people asked about APL. I reran on a smaller set of like-for-like coding tasks - it came 4th at 110 tokens. Turns out APL's famous terseness isn't a plus for LLMs: the tokenizer is badly optimised for its symbol set, so all those unique glyphs (⍳, ⍴, ⌽, etc.) end up as multiple tokens each.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Update 2:</strong> A reader reached out about J - a language I'd never heard of. It's an array language like APL but uses ASCII instead of special symbols. It dominates at just 70 tokens average, nearly half of Clojure (109 tokens). Array languages can be extremely token-efficient when they avoid exotic symbol sets. If token efficiency turns out to be a key driver, this is perhaps a very interesting way for languages to evolve.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There was a very meaningful gap of 2.6x between C (the least token efficient language I compared) and Clojure (the most efficient).</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, dynamic languages were much more token efficient (not having to declare <em>any</em> types saves a lot of tokens) - though JavaScript was the most verbose of the dynamic languages analysed.</p>
<p>What did surprise me though was just <em>how</em> token efficient some of the functional languages like Haskell and F# were - barely less efficient than the most efficient dynamic languages. This is no doubt to their very efficient type inference systems. I think using typed languages for LLMs has an awful lot of benefits - not least because it can compile and get rapid feedback on any syntax errors or method hallucinations. With LSP it becomes even more helpful.</p>
<p>Assuming 80% of your context window is code reads, edits and diffs, using Haskell or F# would potentially result in a significantly longer development session than using Go or C#.</p>
<p>It's really interesting to me that we are in this strange future where we have petaflops of compute but code verbosity of our 'small' context windows actually might matter. LLMs continue to break my mental model of how we should be looking at software engineering.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>OpenAI has a simple tokenizer you can play around with <a href="https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer">here</a>. Many people have wrote about how tokenization works - there's a good introduction <a href="https://christophergs.com/blog/understanding-llm-tokenization">here</a> if you'd like to learn more. The key thing is that it doesn't map <em>at all</em> to character usage in bytes. Common words and phrases can be 1 token for the entire word, but certain symbols and sequences can be one token per character. <a href="#fnref1">↩︎</a></p>

                    <p>Good evening.</p>

<p>On Friday, the Department of Justice served the Federal Reserve with grand jury subpoenas, threatening a criminal indictment related to my testimony before the Senate Banking Committee last June. That testimony concerned in part a multi-year project to renovate historic Federal Reserve office buildings.</p>

<p>I have deep respect for the rule of law and for accountability in our democracy. No one—certainly not the chair of the Federal Reserve—is above the law. But this unprecedented action should be seen in the broader context of the administration's threats and ongoing pressure.</p>

<p>This new threat is not about my testimony last June or about the renovation of the Federal Reserve buildings. It is not about Congress's oversight role; the Fed through testimony and other public disclosures made every effort to keep Congress informed about the renovation project. Those are pretexts. The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the President.</p>

<p>This is about whether the Fed will be able to continue to set interest rates based on evidence and economic conditions—or whether instead monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation.</p>

<p>I have served at the Federal Reserve under four administrations, Republicans and Democrats alike. In every case, I have carried out my duties without political fear or favor, focused solely on our mandate of price stability and maximum employment. Public service sometimes requires standing firm in the face of threats. I will continue to do the job the Senate confirmed me to do, with integrity and a commitment to serving the American people.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>
