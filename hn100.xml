		<p>I gave all my Apple wealth away because wealth and power are not what I live for. I have a lot of fun and happiness. I funded a lot of important museums and arts groups in San Jose, the city of my birth, and they named a street after me for being good. I now speak publicly and have risen to the top. I have no idea how much I have but after speaking for 20 years it might be $10M plus a couple of homes. I never look for any type of tax dodge. I earn money from my labor and pay something like 55% combined tax on it. I am the happiest person ever. Life to me was never about accomplishment, but about Happiness, which is Smiles minus Frowns. I developed these philosophies when I was 18-20 years old and I never sold out.</p>

<h2>"Privacy preserving age verification" is bullshit (<a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/08/14/bellovin/#wont-someone-think-of-the-cryptographers">permalink</a>)</h2>
<p>I don't think that it's impossible for politicians, even nontechnical politicians, to make good tech policy. After all, the fact that no one in Congress is a microbiologist doesn't stop federal standards from delivering potable water (and it doesn't excuse the ghastly failures, such as Flint, MI):</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/11/21/policy-based-evidence/">https://pluralistic.net/2024/11/21/policy-based-evidence/</a></p>
<p>For politicians to make good policy, they don't need to be technical experts: they need to have solid, independent, well-resourced expert agencies. Those would be the very agencies that Trump and Musk have DOGEd into oblivion, which is pretty ominous, since the work of expert agencies is how you avoid dying of food poisoning, water poisoning, air poisoning, collapsing buildings, faulty antilock brakes, train explosions and plane-crashes.</p>
<p>But when it comes to tech policy, politicians get it all so goddamned wrong. Partly that's because the cartel of tech companies lies to them like crazy, even under oath, leading to a kind of nihilistic refusal to believe <em>any</em> expert input. Mark Zuckerberg wants you to think that's it's <em>inconceivable</em> for you to have a social life without him eavesdropping on it, and any rule demanding this is a farce, like a demand to make water that's not wet:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/11/08/divisibility/#technognosticism">https://pluralistic.net/2022/11/08/divisibility/#technognosticism</a></p>
<p>Big Tech's highly resourced bullshit machine convinces some politicians that technical expertise is not to be trusted, and gives other, more cynical politicians cover for ignoring experts by saying, "Oh you people are always telling us that this or that is impossible."</p>
<p>For example, since the Clinton era, politicians all over the world demanded a kind of impossible encryption: encryption that works perfectly when it's doing something legitimate, like keeping hackers from pushing malware to your pacemaker or stealing your life's savings or listening in on you through your phone's microphone, but <em>also</em> they require that this encryption offer <em>no</em> protection to criminals, drug dealers, terrorists, child abusers, and other miscreants.</p>
<p>This really <em>is</em> like water that's not wet. We can make encryption that works. It's hard to get right, but when we do, it offers a wondrous level of protection from interception and eavesdropping, scrambling our data so thoroughly that you would have to consume multiple <em>universes</em> worth of time and space to build all the computers necessary to guess the descrambling key. We can also make encryption that doesn't work. People do this by accident all the time. Sometimes, the NSA does it on purpose (and doesn't mention that fact to the people who rely on it for their safety and integrity):</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_EC_DRBG">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_EC_DRBG</a></p>
<p>But what we absolutely, positively, totally <em>cannot</em> make is encryption that both works <em>and</em> does not work, depending on whose secrets it is protecting. That's impossible.</p>
<p>But when technologists tell policymakers this, they tell us that they have every confidence in our ingenuity, and also, they can't be certain we're not telling a Zuck-style fable about how the stuff we merely disprefer is actually impossible. They tell us to <em>NERD HARDER!</em></p>
<p><em>NERD HARDER!</em> is the answer every time a politician gets a technological idée-fixe about how to solve a social problem by creating a technology that can't exist. It's the answer that EU politicians who backed the catastrophic proposal to require copyright filters for all user-generated content came up with, when faced with objections that these filters would block <em>billions</em> of legitimate acts of speech:</p>
<p><a href="https://memex.craphound.com/2019/04/03/after-months-of-insisting-that-article13-doesnt-require-filters-top-eu-commissioner-says-article-13-requires-filters/">https://memex.craphound.com/2019/04/03/after-months-of-insisting-that-article13-doesnt-require-filters-top-eu-commissioner-says-article-13-requires-filters/</a></p>
<p>When politicians seize on a technological impossibility as a technological necessity, they flail about and desperately latch onto scholarly work that they can brandish as evidence that their idea <em>could</em> be accomplished.</p>
<p>For example, back in 2019, Trump's Bureau of Land Management tried to impose a ton of absolutely bizarre, environmentally devastating requirements on Burning Man's land-use permit. One of these requirements was to effectively ban LED lights at night (!), on the basis that these were so bright at altitude that they could disrupt nocturnal birds.</p>
<p>In support of this measure, the BLM cited a PhD dissertation from a physicist who developed a method for estimating light pollution. That physicist turns out to be a burner, who filed comments in the docket describing how the BLM had misapplied his work, making crude mathematical errors that led them to grossly overstate the amount of light pollution at altitude (I've just spent an hour trying to find this comment and I came up craps – if you can find it, please let me know, as it was <em>delicious</em>).</p>
<p>That kind of Annie Hall/Marshall McLuhan/"You know nothing of my work" moment is always fantastic, and especially so when politicians are demanding that technologists <em>NERD HARDER!</em> to realize their cherished impossibilities.</p>
<p>That's just happened, and in relation to one of the scariest, most destructive <em>NERD HARDER!</em> tech policies ever to be assayed (a stiff competition). I'm talking about the UK Online Safety Act, which imposes a duty on websites to verify the age of people they communicate with before serving them anything that could be construed as child-inappropriate (a category that includes, e.g., much of Wikipedia):</p>
<p><a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org/news/2025/08/11/wikimedia-foundation-challenges-uk-online-safety-act-regulations/">https://wikimediafoundation.org/news/2025/08/11/wikimedia-foundation-challenges-uk-online-safety-act-regulations/</a></p>
<p>The Starmer government has, incredibly, developed a passion for internet regulations that are even stupider than Tony Blair's <em>and</em> David Cameron's. Requiring people to identify themselves (generally, via their credit cards) in order to look at porn will create a giant database of every kink and fetish of every person in the UK, which will inevitably leak and provide criminals and foreign spies with a kompromat system they can sort by net worth of the people contained within.</p>
<p>This hasn't deterred Starmer, who insists that if we just <em>NERD HARDER!</em>, we can use things like "zero-knowledge proofs" to create "privacy-preserving" age verification system, whereby a service can assure itself that it is communicating with an adult without ever being able to determine <em>who</em> it is communicating with.</p>
<p>In support of this idea, Starmer and co like to cite some genuinely exciting and cool cryptographic work on privacy-preserving credential schemes. Now, one of the principal authors of the key papers on these credential schemes, Steve Bellovin, has published a paper that is pithily summed up via its title, "Privacy-Preserving Age Verification—and Its Limitations":</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~smb/papers/age-verify.pdf">https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~smb/papers/age-verify.pdf</a></p>
<p>The tldr of this paper is that Starmer's idea will not work and cannot work. The research he relies on to defend the technological feasibility of his cherished plan does not support his conclusion.</p>
<p>Bellovin starts off by looking at the different approaches various players have mooted for verifying their users' age. For example, Google says it can deploy a "behavioral" system that relies on Google surveillance dossiers to make guesses about your age. Google refuses to explain how this would work, but Bellovin sums up several of the well-understood behavioral age estimation techniques and explains why they won't work. It's one thing to screw up age estimation when deciding which ad to show you; it's another thing altogether to do this when deciding whether you can access the internet.</p>
<p>Others say they can estimate your age by using AI to analyze a picture of your face. This is a stupid idea for many reasons, not least of which is that biometric age estimation is notoriously unreliable when it comes to distinguishing, say, 16 or 17 year olds from 18 year olds. Nevertheless, there are sitting US Congressmen who not only think this would work – they labor under the misapprehension that this is already going on:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/04/09/how-to-make-a-child-safe-tiktok/">https://pluralistic.net/2023/04/09/how-to-make-a-child-safe-tiktok/</a></p>
<p>So that just leaves the privacy-preserving credential schemes, especially the Camenisch-Lysyanskaya protocol. This involves an Identity Provider (IDP) that establishes a user's identity and characteristics using careful document checks and other procedures. The IDP then hands the user a "primary credential" that can attest to everything the IDP knows about the user, and any number of "subcredentials" that only attest to specific facts about that user (such as their age).</p>
<p>These are used in zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP) – a way for two parties to validate that one of them asserts a fact without learning what that fact is in the process (this is super cool stuff). Users can send their subcredentials to a third party, who can use a ZKP to validate them without learning anything else about the user – so you could prove your age (or even just prove that you are over 18 without disclosing your age at all) without disclosing your identity.</p>
<p>There's some good news for implementing CL on the web: rather than developing a transcendentally expensive and complex new system for these credential exchanges and checks, CL can piggyback on the existing Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) that powers your browser's ability to have secure sessions. When you visit a website with https:// in front of the address (instead of just http://).</p>
<p>However, doing so poses several difficulties, which Bellovin enumerates under a usefully frank section header: "INSURMOUNTABLE OBSTACLES."</p>
<p>The most insurmountable of these obstacles is getting set up with an IDP in the first place – that is, proving who you are to some agency, but only <em>one</em> such agency (so you can't create two primary credentials and share one of them with someone underage). Bellovin cites Supreme Court cases about voter ID laws and the burdens they impose on people who are poor, old, young, disabled, rural, etc.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, it can be insurmountably hard for a lot of people to get, say, a driver's license, or any other singular piece of ID that they can provide to an IDP in order to get set up on the system.</p>
<p>The usual answer for this is for IDPs to allow multiple kinds of ID. This does ease the burden on users, but at the expense of creating fatal weaknesses in the system: if you can set up an identity with multiple kinds of ID, you can visit different IDPs and set up an ID with each (just as many Americans today have drivers licenses from more than one state).</p>
<p>The next obstacle is "user challenges," like the problem of households with shared computers, or computers in libraries, hotels, community centers and other public places. The only effective way to do this is to create (expensive) online credential stores, which are likely to be out of reach of the poor and disadvantaged people who disproportionately rely on public or shared computers.</p>
<p>Next are the "economic issues": this stuff is <em>expensive</em> to set up and maintain, and someone's gotta pay for it. We could ask websites that offer kid-inappropriate content to pay for it, but that sets up an irreconcilable conflict of interest. These websites are going to want to minimize their costs, and everything they can do to reduce costs will make the system unacceptably worse. For example, they could choose only to set up accounts with IDPs that are local to the company that operates the server, meaning that anyone who lives somewhere else and wants to access that website is going to have to somehow get certified copies of e.g. their birth certificate and driver's license to IDPs on the other side of the planet. The alternative to having website foot the bill for this is asking users to pay for it – meaning that, once again, we exclude poor people from the internet.</p>
<p>Finally, there's "governance": who runs this thing? In practice, the security and privacy guarantees of the CL protocol require two different kinds of wholly independent institutions: identity providers (who verify your documents), and certificate authorities (who issue cryptographic certificates based on those documents). If these two functions take place under one roof, the privacy guarantees of the system immediately evaporate.</p>
<p>An IDP's most important role is verifying documents and associating them with a specific person. But not all IDPs will be created equal, and people who wish to cheat the system will gravitate to the worst IDPs. However, lots of people who have no nefarious intent will <em>also</em> use these IDPs, merely because they are close by, or popular, or were selected at random. A decision to strike off an IDP and rescind its verifications will force lots of people – potentially millions of people – to start over with the whole business of identifying themselves, during which time they will be unable to access much of the web. There's no practical way for the average person to judge whether an IDP they choose is likely to be found wanting in the future.</p>
<p>So we can regulate IDPs, but who will do the regulation? Age verification laws affect people outside of a government's national territory – anyone seeking to access content on a webserver falls under age verification's remit. Remember, IDPs handle all kinds of sensitive data: do you want Russia, say, to have a say in deciding who can be an IDP and what disclosure rules you will have to follow?</p>
<p>To regulate IDPs (and certificate authorities), these entities will have to keep logs, which further compromises the privacy guarantees of the CL protocol.</p>
<p>Looming all of this is a problem with the CL protocol as being built on regulated entities, which is that CL is envisioned as a way to do all kinds of business, from opening a bank account to proving your vaccination status or your right to work or receive welfare. Authoritarian governments who order primary credential revocations of their political opponents could thoroughly and terrifyingly "unperson" them at the stroke of a pen.</p>
<p>The paper's conclusions provide a highly readable summary of these issues, which constitute a stinging rebuke to anyone contemplating age-verification schemes. These go well beyond the UK, and are in the works in Canada, Australia, the EU, Texas and Louisiana.</p>
<p>Age verification is an impossibility, and an impossibly terrible idea with impossibly vast consequences for privacy and the open web, as my EFF colleague Jason Kelley explained on the Malwarebytes podcast:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/podcast/2025/08/the-worst-thing-for-online-rights-an-age-restricted-grey-web-lock-and-code-s06e16">https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/podcast/2025/08/the-worst-thing-for-online-rights-an-age-restricted-grey-web-lock-and-code-s06e16</a></p>
<p>Politicians – even nontechnical ones – can make good tech policy, provided they take expert feedback seriously (and distinguish it from self-interested industry lobbying).</p>
<p>When it comes to tech policy, wanting it badly is not enough. The fact that it would be <em>really cool</em> if we could get technology to do something has no bearing on whether we can actually get technology to do that thing. <em>NERD HARDER!</em> isn't a policy, it's a wish.</p>
<p>Wish in one hand and shit in the other and see which one will be full first:</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p><span>W</span>ith a trip to Florence booked, all I want is to rewatch <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/apr/04/medici-drama-premiere-cannes-tv-festival-dustin-hoffman-renaissance" data-link-name="in body link">Medici</a>. The 2016 historical drama series tells of the rise of the powerful Florentine banking dynasty, and with it, the story of the Renaissance. Until recently, I could simply have gone to Netflix and found it there, alongside a wide array of award-winning and obscure titles. But when I Google the show in 2025, the Netflix link only takes me to a blank page. I don’t see it on HBO Max, Disney+, Apple TV+, or any of the smaller streaming platforms. On Amazon Prime I am required to buy each of the three seasons or 24 episodes separately, whereupon they would be stored in a library subject to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/article/2024/may/14/my-whole-library-is-wiped-out-what-it-means-to-own-movies-and-tv-in-the-age-of-streaming-services?utm_source=chatgpt.com" data-link-name="in body link">overnight deletion</a>. Raised in the land of The Pirate Bay, the Swedish torrent index, I feel, for the first time in a decade, a nostalgia for the high seas of digital piracy. And I am not alone.</p><figure id="disclaimer" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.DisclaimerBlockElement"><span></span></figure><p>For my teenage self in the 00s, torrenting was the norm. Need the new Coldplay album on your iPod? The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/pirate-bay" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Pirate Bay</a>. The 1968 adaptation of Romeo and Juliet? The Pirate Bay. Whatever you needed was accessible with just a couple of clicks. But as smartphones proliferated, so did Spotify, the music streaming platform that is also headquartered in Sweden. The same Scandinavian country had become a hub of illegal torrenting and simultaneously conjured forth its solution.</p><p>“Spotify would never have seen the light of day without The Pirate Bay,” Per Sundin, the then managing director of Universal Music Sweden, <a href="https://www.svd.se/a/2ca5d142-d3a9-3d76-8a3c-d86946e3111c/piratkrigets-forlorare" data-link-name="in body link">reflected in 2011</a>. But music torrenting died out as we all either listened with ads or paid for the subscription. And when Netflix launched in Sweden in late 2012, open talk of torrenting moving images also stopped. Most of the big shows and a great collection of award-winning films could all be found for just 79 SEK (£6) a month. Meanwhile, the three founders of The Pirate Bay were <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jun/02/last-remaining-pirate-bay-founder-freed-from-jail-fredrik-neij" data-link-name="in body link">arrested and eventually jailed</a>. Pirating faded into the history books as far as I was concerned.</p><p>A decade and a half on from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pirate_Bay_trial" data-link-name="in body link">the Pirate Bay trial</a>, the winds have begun to shift. On an unusually warm summer’s day, I sit with fellow film critics by the old city harbour, once a haven for merchants and, rumour has it, smugglers. Cold <em>bigstrongs</em> in hand (that’s what they call pints up here), they start venting about the “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/11/users-advertisers-we-are-all-trapped-in-the-enshittification-of-the-internet" data-link-name="in body link">enshittification</a>” of streaming – enshittification being the process by which platforms degrade their services and ultimately die in the pursuit of profit. Netflix now costs upwards of 199 SEK (£15), and you need more and more subscriptions to watch the same shows you used to find in one place. Most platforms now offer plans that, despite the fee, force advertisements on subscribers. Regional restrictions often compel users to use VPNs to access the full selection of available content. The average European household now spends close to €700 (£600) a year on three or more VOD subscriptions. People pay more and get less.</p><p>A fellow film critic confides anonymously: “I never stopped pirating, and my partner also does it if he doesn’t find the precise edition he is looking for on DVD.” While some people never abandoned piracy, others admit they have recently returned – this time turning to unofficial streaming platforms. One commonly used app is legal but can, through community add-ons, channel illicit streams. “Downloading is too difficult. I don’t know where to start,” says one film viewer. “The shady streams might bombard me with ads, but at least I don’t have to worry about getting hacked or caught.”</p><figure id="b48629a1-38f6-493a-a2f4-d39ff493dcdb" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-2"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/81bce2ef8b608cc355c742fbcc5492d22b27128f/144_0_4309_3447/master/4309.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/81bce2ef8b608cc355c742fbcc5492d22b27128f/144_0_4309_3447/master/4309.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/81bce2ef8b608cc355c742fbcc5492d22b27128f/144_0_4309_3447/master/4309.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/81bce2ef8b608cc355c742fbcc5492d22b27128f/144_0_4309_3447/master/4309.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/81bce2ef8b608cc355c742fbcc5492d22b27128f/144_0_4309_3447/master/4309.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/81bce2ef8b608cc355c742fbcc5492d22b27128f/144_0_4309_3447/master/4309.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="Life on the open seas … Swedish-based filesharing website The Pirate Bay." src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/81bce2ef8b608cc355c742fbcc5492d22b27128f/144_0_4309_3447/master/4309.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="355.9793455558134" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Life on the open seas … Swedish-based filesharing website The Pirate Bay.</span> Photograph: FocusDigital/Alamy</figcaption></figure><p>According to London‑based piracy monitoring and content‑protection firm MUSO, unlicensed streaming is the predominant source of TV and film piracy, <a href="https://6347345.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/6347345/2023%20Piracy%20by%20Industry%20Data%20Review-Final.pdf?utm_campaign=PBI%202023%20Report&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsmi=293335558&amp;utm_content=293335558&amp;utm_source=hs_automation" data-link-name="in body link">accounting for 96% in 2023</a>.

With titles scattered, prices on the rise, and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/barrycollins/2020/05/12/the-netflix-lottery-how-your-browser-choice-affects-streaming-quality/" data-link-name="in body link">bitrates throttled depending on your browser</a>, it is little wonder some viewers are raising the jolly roger again. Studios carve out fiefdoms, build walls and levy tolls for those who wish to visit. The result is artificial scarcity in a digital world that promised abundance.</p><p>Whether piracy today is rebellion or resignation is almost irrelevant; the sails are hoisted either way. As the streaming landscape fractures into feudal territories, more viewers are turning to the high seas. The Medici understood the value linked to access. A client could travel from Rome to London and still draw on their credit, thanks to a network built on trust and interoperability. If today’s studios want to survive the storm, they may need to rediscover that truth.</p></div></div>]]></description>

    <p data-block-key="8637c">The last few months have been an exciting time for the Gemma family of open models. We introduced <a href="https://blog.google/technology/developers/gemma-3/">Gemma 3</a> and <a href="https://developers.googleblog.com/en/gemma-3-quantized-aware-trained-state-of-the-art-ai-to-consumer-gpus/">Gemma 3 QAT</a>, delivering state-of-the-art performance for single cloud and desktop accelerators. Then, we announced the full release of <a href="https://developers.googleblog.com/en/introducing-gemma-3n/">Gemma 3n</a>, a mobile-first architecture bringing powerful, real-time multimodal AI directly to edge devices. Our goal has been to provide useful tools for developers to build with AI, and we continue to be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx6IuEggeac">amazed</a> by the vibrant <a href="https://deepmind.google/models/gemma/gemmaverse/">Gemmaverse</a> you are helping create, celebrating together as downloads surpassed 200 million last week.</p><p data-block-key="6eq2f">Today, we're adding a new, highly specialized tool to the Gemma 3 toolkit: <a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemma/docs/core/huggingface_text_full_finetune">Gemma 3 270M</a>, a compact, 270-million parameter model designed from the ground up for task-specific fine-tuning with strong instruction-following and text structuring capabilities already trained in.</p>

                        Gemma 3 270M brings strong instruction-following capabilities to a small-footprint model. As shown by the IFEval benchmark (which tests a model's ability to follow verifiable instructions), it establishes a new level of performance for its size, making sophisticated AI capabilities more accessible for on-device and research applications.

    <h2 data-block-key="rkc3a" id="core-capabilities-of-gemma-3-270m">Core capabilities of Gemma 3 270M</h2><ul><li data-block-key="4ki9m"><b>Compact and capable architecture:</b> Our new model has a total of 270 million parameters: 170 million embedding parameters due to a large vocabulary size and 100 million for our transformer blocks. Thanks to the large vocabulary of 256k tokens, the model can handle specific and rare tokens, making it a strong base model to be further fine-tuned in specific domains and languages.</li></ul><ul><li data-block-key="394ff"><b>Extreme energy efficiency:</b> A key advantage of Gemma 3 270M is its low power consumption. Internal tests on a Pixel 9 Pro SoC show the INT4-quantized model used just 0.75% of the battery for 25 conversations, making it our most power-efficient Gemma model.</li></ul><ul><li data-block-key="5c37m"><b>Instruction following:</b> An instruction-tuned model is released alongside a pre-trained checkpoint. While this model is not designed for complex conversational use cases, it’s a strong model that follows general instructions right out of the box.</li></ul><ul><li data-block-key="fonft"><b>Production-ready quantization:</b> <a href="https://developers.googleblog.com/en/gemma-3-quantized-aware-trained-state-of-the-art-ai-to-consumer-gpus/">Quantization-Aware Trained</a> (QAT) <a href="https://huggingface.co/collections/google/gemma-3-release-67c6c6f89c4f76621268bb6d">checkpoints are available</a>, enabling you to run the models at INT4 precision with minimal performance degradation, which is essential for deploying on resource-constrained devices.</li></ul><p data-block-key="cr9ib">In engineering, success is defined by efficiency, not just raw power. You wouldn't use a sledgehammer to hang a picture frame. The same principle applies to building with AI.</p><p data-block-key="2mh3o">Gemma 3 270M embodies this "right tool for the job" philosophy. It's a high-quality foundation model that follows instructions well out of the box, and its true power is unlocked through fine-tuning. Once specialized, it can execute tasks like text classification and data extraction with remarkable accuracy, speed, and cost-effectiveness. By starting with a compact, capable model, you can build production systems that are lean, fast, and dramatically cheaper to operate.</p><h2 data-block-key="nmmxb" id="a-real-world-blueprint-for-success"><b><br></b>A real-world blueprint for success</h2><p data-block-key="9ef55">The power of this approach has already delivered incredible results in the real world. A perfect example is <a href="https://deepmind.google/models/gemma/gemmaverse/adaptiveml/">the work done by Adaptive ML with SK Telecom.</a> Facing the challenge of nuanced, multilingual content moderation, they chose to specialize. Instead of using a massive, general-purpose model, Adaptive ML fine-tuned a Gemma 3 4B model. The results were stunning: the specialized Gemma model not only met but exceeded the performance of much larger proprietary models on its specific task.</p><p data-block-key="8htle">Gemma 3 270M is designed to let developers take this approach even further, unlocking even greater efficiency for well-defined tasks. It's the perfect starting point for creating a fleet of small, specialized models, each an expert at its own task.</p><p data-block-key="fah9p">But this power of specialization isn't just for enterprise tasks; it also enables powerful creative applications. For example, check out <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/webml-community/bedtime-story-generator">this Bedtime Story Generator web app</a>:</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Many software projects take a long time to compile. Sometimes that’s just due to the sheer amount of code, like in the LLVM project. But often a build is slower than it should be for dumb, fixable reasons.</p><p>I’ve had the suspicion that <em>most</em> builds are doing dumb stuff, but I had no way to <em>see it</em>. So I’ve been working on a cross-platform tool to help speed up builds (you can try it, see below). It works with any build system or programming language (Not just C/C++). Its timeline looks like this:</p><p><img src="https://danielchasehooper.com/posts/syscall-build-snooping/rust-proj_hu5c161a437365ba7a83eec07e039d5c8d_343237_675x0_resize_box_3.png" width="675" srcset="https://danielchasehooper.com/posts/syscall-build-snooping/rust-proj_hu5c161a437365ba7a83eec07e039d5c8d_343237_1350x0_resize_box_3.png 3x, https://danielchasehooper.com/posts/syscall-build-snooping/rust-proj_hu5c161a437365ba7a83eec07e039d5c8d_343237_1350x0_resize_box_3.png 2x, https://danielchasehooper.com/posts/syscall-build-snooping/rust-proj_hu5c161a437365ba7a83eec07e039d5c8d_343237_675x0_resize_box_3.png 1x" alt="What the Fork showing the build timeline of a Rust project"></p><p>It’s more than just a generic system profiler: it looks for build-specific problems. A few examples: using make without the <code>-j</code> flag, disproportionate time being spent on certain files or compiler phases (as reported by tools like clang’s <code>-ftime-trace</code>), and commands that could’ve been run in parallel but weren’t. It’s especially helpful for optimizing CI builds, which are often clean rebuilds without caching.</p><p>I named it <code>What the Fork</code> after the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_%28system_call%29" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>fork()</code></a> system call that spawns new processes. You use it by writing <code>wtf</code> before a build command:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sh"><span><span>$ <span># A few possible examples:</span>
</span></span><span><span>$ wtf make
</span></span><span><span>$ wtf cargo build
</span></span><span><span>$ wtf gradle build
</span></span><span><span>$ wtf npm run build
</span></span><span><span>$ wtf zig build
</span></span><span><span>$ wtf -x <span># starts a build of the front most Xcode window</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Here it is recording the build of a macOS app:</p><video playsinline="" autoplay="" loop="" muted="" width="100%">
<source src="https://danielchasehooper.com/posts/syscall-build-snooping/build.mp4" type="video/mp4">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video><h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2><p>A build is just a bunch of commands that produce your finished program. At its simplest, it could be a shell script like this:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sh"><span><span><span>#!/bin/bash
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span>clang main.c -o program
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>That script requires 3 programs to produce the final result: <code>bash</code>, <code>clang</code>, and — <em>surprise!</em> — <code>ld</code>, the linker, which clang runs automatically. Unexpected build steps are often the source of slowdowns and are even more likely in bigger projects, which often use something like <code>cargo</code>, <code>make</code>, <code>bazel</code>, <code>gradle</code>, or <code>xcodebuild</code> instead of a shell script. Those tools still just execute commands, but they also perform caching, dependency analysis, and scheduling to do the least amount of work as efficiently as possible.</p><p>While you can see the commands a build tool runs by watching the terminal output, that doesn’t tell you what commands <em>those</em> commands run (like <code>clang</code> running <code>ld</code>) and doesn’t include detailed timing! So if we want to see <em>everything</em> a build does, we need to listen for the system calls that start and terminate processes: <code>fork</code>, <code>exec</code>, and <code>exit</code>. Each operating system has a its own way to do that:</p><ul><li>macOS has the Endpoint Security API</li><li>Linux has <code>ptrace()</code></li><li>Windows has the “<a href="https://caseymuratori.com/blog_0025" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Worst API Ever Made</a>”: Event Tracing for Windows</li></ul><p>Each of those API are a pain to use for different reasons, but they do provide the information required to reconstruct a timeline. Here is our simple shell script’s execution visualized in the macOS version of <code>What the Fork</code>.</p><p><img src="https://danielchasehooper.com/posts/syscall-build-snooping/small-script_hucab220b15dadc25e4cd89a41bea39703_677666_675x0_resize_box_3.png" width="675" srcset="https://danielchasehooper.com/posts/syscall-build-snooping/small-script_hucab220b15dadc25e4cd89a41bea39703_677666_1350x0_resize_box_3.png 3x, https://danielchasehooper.com/posts/syscall-build-snooping/small-script_hucab220b15dadc25e4cd89a41bea39703_677666_1350x0_resize_box_3.png 2x, https://danielchasehooper.com/posts/syscall-build-snooping/small-script_hucab220b15dadc25e4cd89a41bea39703_677666_675x0_resize_box_3.png 1x" alt="build timeline of a simple build script"></p><p>Keen readers will have noticed that these techniques allow the app to be used on any type of program that launches sub-processes - not just builds! If you have any ideas for how that might be useful outside of build optimization, let me know.</p><h2 id="things-ive-noticed">Things I’ve Noticed</h2><p>Being able to see your build reveals a lot. I’ve had engineers from Delta, Mozilla, and Apple try the tool on their projects and each one found something unexpected. Let me give you some examples.</p><p>I’ll start with an open source project that uses cargo to build. I’m going to zoom in on the compilation of a single dependency:</p><p><img src="https://danielchasehooper.com/posts/syscall-build-snooping/capstone-cargo_hu7a47cc24786eaca6491b42c9b080c516_1188612_675x0_resize_box_3.png" width="675" srcset="https://danielchasehooper.com/posts/syscall-build-snooping/capstone-cargo_hu7a47cc24786eaca6491b42c9b080c516_1188612_1350x0_resize_box_3.png 3x, https://danielchasehooper.com/posts/syscall-build-snooping/capstone-cargo_hu7a47cc24786eaca6491b42c9b080c516_1188612_1350x0_resize_box_3.png 2x, https://danielchasehooper.com/posts/syscall-build-snooping/capstone-cargo_hu7a47cc24786eaca6491b42c9b080c516_1188612_675x0_resize_box_3.png 1x" alt="cargo compiling a dependency without any parallelism"></p><p>Oops! No parallelism! Files are compiled one at a time. It could be about 10 times faster if cargo ran multiple commands at once on my 10 core M1 CPU. I’d have never noticed this without a timeline visualization. If you want to see what good parallelism looks like, check out how <code>ninja</code> builds the llvm project:</p><p><img src="https://danielchasehooper.com/posts/syscall-build-snooping/llvm-ninja_hudb211a64d5721909fcd6e62f8cf6bcfc_3213324_675x0_resize_box_3.png" width="675" srcset="https://danielchasehooper.com/posts/syscall-build-snooping/llvm-ninja_hudb211a64d5721909fcd6e62f8cf6bcfc_3213324_1350x0_resize_box_3.png 3x, https://danielchasehooper.com/posts/syscall-build-snooping/llvm-ninja_hudb211a64d5721909fcd6e62f8cf6bcfc_3213324_1350x0_resize_box_3.png 2x, https://danielchasehooper.com/posts/syscall-build-snooping/llvm-ninja_hudb211a64d5721909fcd6e62f8cf6bcfc_3213324_675x0_resize_box_3.png 1x" alt="ninja compiling llvm"></p><p>Every core of my machine is kept busy the entire time. It’s actually slightly over-subscribed with 12 jobs in flight on my 10 core machine, which <a href="https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja/blob/370edd49a47379d0c3ff0c0ae9d825e627fd37c3/src/ninja.cc#L253-L264" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is intentional</a> in case some jobs are blocked on IO. Perfection. Perfect is boring though, lets look at a problem. Here’s a tiny slice of a CMake build from another open source project:</p><p><img src="https://danielchasehooper.com/posts/syscall-build-snooping/one_file_hu7598642d0b8c3cdff846be8cded6b8df_16601_675x0_resize_box_3.png" width="675" srcset="https://danielchasehooper.com/posts/syscall-build-snooping/one_file_hu7598642d0b8c3cdff846be8cded6b8df_16601_980x0_resize_box_3.png 3x, https://danielchasehooper.com/posts/syscall-build-snooping/one_file_hu7598642d0b8c3cdff846be8cded6b8df_16601_980x0_resize_box_3.png 2x, https://danielchasehooper.com/posts/syscall-build-snooping/one_file_hu7598642d0b8c3cdff846be8cded6b8df_16601_675x0_resize_box_3.png 1x" alt="cmake compiling one file"></p><p>Here CMake gets Xcode’s path with <code>xcode-select -print-path</code>, the OS version with <code>sw_vers</code>, and then recursively calls cmake/make a few times for good measure, and finally compiles and links a file.</p><p>Only the green boxes in that timeline are doing useful work. One could argue that <em>none</em> of what CMake does is “useful work”, in the sense that it just builds the thing that actually builds the project. Regardless, let’s just accept that CMake needs to do this weird cmake-&gt;make-&gt;make-&gt;clang dance to figure out the build environment.</p><p>Zooming out reveals that the weird dance happens 85 times!</p><p><img src="https://danielchasehooper.com/posts/syscall-build-snooping/all_files_hu17a5163277e0260f65f3209ecb6b1bf3_558046_675x0_resize_box_3.png" width="675" srcset="https://danielchasehooper.com/posts/syscall-build-snooping/all_files_hu17a5163277e0260f65f3209ecb6b1bf3_558046_1350x0_resize_box_3.png 3x, https://danielchasehooper.com/posts/syscall-build-snooping/all_files_hu17a5163277e0260f65f3209ecb6b1bf3_558046_1350x0_resize_box_3.png 2x, https://danielchasehooper.com/posts/syscall-build-snooping/all_files_hu17a5163277e0260f65f3209ecb6b1bf3_558046_675x0_resize_box_3.png 1x" alt="cmake performing 85 actions serially"></p><p>Yikes, no parallelism. It also studiously re-checks the Xcode path and OS version 85 times, just in case the OS version changes mid-build.</p><p>Ok enough about cmake. There are other builds to explore! Here’s <code>xcodebuild</code> building a 100,000 line Objective-C project:</p><p><img src="https://danielchasehooper.com/posts/syscall-build-snooping/principle-xcodebuild_hu177c33e60d46ac5f33a1b6a42745e4be_1310414_675x0_resize_box_3.png" width="675" srcset="https://danielchasehooper.com/posts/syscall-build-snooping/principle-xcodebuild_hu177c33e60d46ac5f33a1b6a42745e4be_1310414_1350x0_resize_box_3.png 3x, https://danielchasehooper.com/posts/syscall-build-snooping/principle-xcodebuild_hu177c33e60d46ac5f33a1b6a42745e4be_1310414_1350x0_resize_box_3.png 2x, https://danielchasehooper.com/posts/syscall-build-snooping/principle-xcodebuild_hu177c33e60d46ac5f33a1b6a42745e4be_1310414_675x0_resize_box_3.png 1x" alt="xcodebuild compiling Principle, an Objective-C project"></p><p>Notice how it has gaps towards the end of the build where it only has one or two clang processes running, even when there is a lot more to do.</p><p>It also has 6 seconds of inactivity before starting any useful work. For comparison, <code>ninja</code> takes 0.4 seconds to start compiling the 2,468,083 line llvm project. Ninja is not a 100% fair comparison to other tools, because it benefits from some “baked in” build logic by the tool that created the ninja file, but I think it’s a reasonable “speed of light” performance benchmark for build systems.</p><p>Continuing our tour of various builds, here’s Zig compiling the <a href="https://github.com/orca-app/orca" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Orca Project</a>:</p><p><img src="https://danielchasehooper.com/posts/syscall-build-snooping/orca-zig_hu9ab95d42801dbcc0321d45838c4291e8_2989447_675x0_resize_box_3.png" width="675" srcset="https://danielchasehooper.com/posts/syscall-build-snooping/orca-zig_hu9ab95d42801dbcc0321d45838c4291e8_2989447_1350x0_resize_box_3.png 3x, https://danielchasehooper.com/posts/syscall-build-snooping/orca-zig_hu9ab95d42801dbcc0321d45838c4291e8_2989447_1350x0_resize_box_3.png 2x, https://danielchasehooper.com/posts/syscall-build-snooping/orca-zig_hu9ab95d42801dbcc0321d45838c4291e8_2989447_675x0_resize_box_3.png 1x" alt="the Orca project being compiled by zig build"></p><p>What’s interesting here is that <code>zig build</code> builds dependencies in a random order (To expose ordering problems due to misconfigured builds). That means that sometimes it gets lucky with the ordering, like in the previous image where it’s fast. But sometimes it’s unlucky, like below where the <code>curl</code> dependency got scheduled at the verrrry end, so it doesn’t have any parallelism with the rest of the project:</p><p><img src="https://danielchasehooper.com/posts/syscall-build-snooping/orca-unlucky_hub708cfbf5e2380ba8996c638e4c98dfd_2048208_675x0_resize_box_3.png" width="675" srcset="https://danielchasehooper.com/posts/syscall-build-snooping/orca-unlucky_hub708cfbf5e2380ba8996c638e4c98dfd_2048208_1350x0_resize_box_3.png 3x, https://danielchasehooper.com/posts/syscall-build-snooping/orca-unlucky_hub708cfbf5e2380ba8996c638e4c98dfd_2048208_1350x0_resize_box_3.png 2x, https://danielchasehooper.com/posts/syscall-build-snooping/orca-unlucky_hub708cfbf5e2380ba8996c638e4c98dfd_2048208_675x0_resize_box_3.png 1x" alt="Orca built with curl scheduled last"></p><p>And finally, here’s make/go compiling the github cli project:</p><p><img src="https://danielchasehooper.com/posts/syscall-build-snooping/go_hua28baab3a050f6559e2a55f546cafcf6_1609376_675x0_resize_box_3.png" width="675" srcset="https://danielchasehooper.com/posts/syscall-build-snooping/go_hua28baab3a050f6559e2a55f546cafcf6_1609376_1350x0_resize_box_3.png 3x, https://danielchasehooper.com/posts/syscall-build-snooping/go_hua28baab3a050f6559e2a55f546cafcf6_1609376_1350x0_resize_box_3.png 2x, https://danielchasehooper.com/posts/syscall-build-snooping/go_hua28baab3a050f6559e2a55f546cafcf6_1609376_675x0_resize_box_3.png 1x" alt="make/go compiling the github cli project"></p><p>That big blank area towards the left is all the project’s dependencies being downloaded, so if I wanted to speed up this project’s clean builds, I’d focus on reducing dependencies first.

Of course there are more nuanced issues you can find by looking at a process’s full command, but today I wanted to focus on things that I could show visually.</p><h2 id="early-access">Early Access</h2><p><code>What the Fork</code> runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.kodak.com/en/company/blog-post/statement-regarding-misleading-media-reports/">https://www.kodak.com/en/company/blog-post/statement-regarding-misleading-media-reports/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44901330">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="__nuxt" data-server-rendered="true"> <main tabindex="-1"> <div data-fetch-key="PageBlog:0"><p>Media reports that Kodak is ceasing operations, going out of business, or filing for bankruptcy are inaccurate and reflect a fundamental misunderstanding of a recent technical disclosure the Company made to the SEC in its recently filed second quarter earnings report. These articles are misleading and missing critical context, and we'd like to set the record straight.</p>
<p>The most important things to know are:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Kodak has no plans to cease operations, go out of business, or file for bankruptcy protection.</strong></li><li><strong>To the contrary, Kodak is confident it will repay, extend, or refinance its debt and preferred stock on, or before, its due date.</strong></li><li><strong>When the transactions we have planned are completed, which is expected to be early next year, Kodak will have a stronger balance sheet than we have had in years and will be virtually net debt free.</strong></li><li><strong>The "going concern disclosure" is a technical report that is required by accounting rules.</strong></li><li><strong>We will continue to meet our obligations to all pension fund participants. </strong></li></ul>
<p><u>Pension Fund Transaction</u>
<br>Kodak has been preparing for the pension plan termination for some time and expects to receive approximately $500 million of assets – <em>after</em>
meeting our obligations to all pension fund participants – in December 2025 when the transaction closes. Approximately $300 million of the funds are expected to be cash, and approximately $200 million are expected to be investment assets that will be converted into cash. </p>
<p><u>Kodak's Debt Position </u>
<br>To provide context, Kodak currently has $477 million of term debt and $100 million of preferred stock outstanding. Kodak is required by its loan documents to use the $300 million of cash expected to be received in December to repay term debt. Kodak can then address the remaining $177 million of term debt and $100 million of preferred stock.</p>
<p><u>Kodak's Ongoing Operations</u>
<br>In addition to our focus on reducing debt and interest payments, we believe our business is stable and self-sustaining. In Q2 2025 we used only $3 million in cash, primarily to invest in growth initiatives, a significant improvement compared with Q1, and we do not plan to rely on cash from the pension fund transaction to fund our operations.</p>
<p>In short, Kodak is confident in its plan to meet all its obligations and optimistic about its future.</p>
<p>For more detailed information about this topic, please review Kodak's Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on August 11, 2025, including the cautionary language about forward looking statements in such filing which are incorporated by reference herein.</p></div></main> </div></div>]]></description>

      <p>Roughly a year ago at the first ever <a href="https://www.localfirstconf.com/">Local First Conference</a>, a friend and
previous colleague – <a href="https://patternist.xyz/">Alex Good</a> – told me about this tool called
<code>jj</code> (<a href="https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/v0.30.0/">Jujutsu</a>). We did the usual thing and I sat down beside him as he
explained it to me. My brain did the usual thing and took in some of the
information but not enough of it, and so I didn’t touch <code>jj</code> for quite some time
after that – but what’s good enough for Alex Good is good enough for me.</p>

<p>After that, I feel like I saw a post about <code>jj</code> once every couple of months on
Hacker News – confirmation bias anyone? It was a constant talking point during
Git Merge 2024, and now it’s a third Git tool that uses the concept of change
identifiers, so it’s a talking point on the <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/git/CAESOdVAspxUJKGAA58i0tvks4ZOfoGf1Aa5gPr0FXzdcywqUUw@mail.gmail.com/">Git mailing list</a>.</p>

<p>So, fast-forward a year or so, and I’ve been using <code>jj</code> for quite some time
while contributing to and maintaining the <code>heartwood</code> repository – the home of
the Radicle protocol – as well as some others. Did I have to convince my whole
team that <code>jj</code> should be used by all of us and we all switch to this new
workflow? No. The first piece of “magic” of <code>jj</code> is that it is essentially a
version control system that has a transparent layer on top of Git itself. A
change in <code>jj</code> will always point to a Git commit. The beauty of its
implementation is that the underlying commit can change as much as it wants,
while the <code>jj</code> change remains the same. This unlocks a lot of nice flows for
managing changes using <code>jj</code>.</p>

<p>So, you must be wondering by now, “How do I blend Radicle with <code>jj</code>?” Well,
let’s dance between the three worlds of <code>jj</code>, Git, and Radicle, to see how they
have melted together to form a beautiful (<em>almost</em>) branch-less workflow.</p>

<h3 id="radicle-and-git">Radicle and Git</h3>

<p>I won’t spend too much time here, but if you don’t know by now, Radicle works on
top of Git to allow people to use this ubiquitous tool, while we benefit from
its storage and protocol. When you start a Radicle repository, it’s essentially
a Git repository where we use some special references and extension points of
Git to cryptographically secure your commits, and store all your
<a href="https://radicle.xyz/guides/user#2-collaborating-the-radicle-way">social, collaborative artifacts</a>. If you haven’t yet, go
<a href="https://radicle.xyz/download">download</a> Radicle and try it yourself using our <a href="https://radicle.xyz/guides">guides</a>.</p>

<p>Note that if you’re already familiar with <code>jj</code> this might not be that
interesting for you, and you can skip to <a href="#user-config">User Config</a>.</p>

<h4 id="my-gitconfig">My <code>.git/config</code></h4>

<p>As a maintainer of a few repositories using Radicle, I naturally need to push to
and fetch from the repository in Radicle <a href="https://app.radicle.xyz/nodes/ash.radicle.garden/rad:z3trNYnLWS11cJWC6BbxDs5niGo82/tree/0003-storage-layout.md">storage</a>. This means
that I’ll need a remote – this is set up for you when you run <code>rad init</code> or <code>rad
clone</code>. This looks like:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>[remote "rad"]</span>
	<span>url</span> <span>=</span> <span>rad://z371PVmDHdjJucejRoRYJcDEvD5pp</span>
	<span>fetch</span> <span>=</span> <span>+refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/rad/*</span>
	<span>fetch</span> <span>=</span> <span>+refs/tags/*:refs/remotes/rad/tags/*</span>
	<span>pushurl</span> <span>=</span> <span>rad://z371PVmDHdjJucejRoRYJcDEvD5pp/z6MkireRatUThvd3qzfKht1S44wpm4FEWSSa4PRMTSQZ3voM</span>
<span>[branch "master"]</span>
	<span>remote</span> <span>=</span> <span>rad</span>
	<span>merge</span> <span>=</span> <span>refs/heads/master</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The <code>rad://</code> URL tells <code>git</code> which <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/gitremote-helpers">remote helper</a> to use
by trying to find <code>git-remote-rad</code>. This will handle fetching/pushing from/to
the repository identified by <code>z371PVmDHdjJucejRoRYJcDEvD5pp</code>. The string
<code>z6MkireRatUThvd3qzfKht1S44wpm4FEWSSa4PRMTSQZ3voM</code> is my Node ID, and
identifies my machine
which makes sure that when I push, my references get stored under that
<a href="https://app.radicle.xyz/nodes/ash.radicle.garden/rad:z3trNYnLWS11cJWC6BbxDs5niGo82/tree/0003-storage-layout.md#layout">namespace</a>. Then when have the usual upstream branch setup
for <code>master</code> for the <code>rad</code> remote – you may be familiar with this Git config entry
when you have your <code>origin</code> set up for another Git forge.</p>

<p>There’s one last piece of the puzzle in config that is an alias for easily
creating a Radicle <a href="https://radicle.xyz/guides/user#working-with-patches">patch</a>.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>[alias]</span>
    <span>patch</span> <span>=</span> <span>push rad HEAD:refs/patches</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>When you push to the special reference <code>refs/patches</code>, the remote helper will
catch this and create a new patch for you, and in this case it will use whatever
<code>HEAD</code> is for the head of the patch. Note that it will use whatever <code>rad/master</code>
is as the base of the patch – that is to say, whatever commits are between
<code>rad/master</code> and <code>HEAD</code> (including <code>HEAD</code>) are the commits being proposed by the
patch. So, whenever I’m ready to make a patch, I use <code>git patch</code> and my
<code>$EDITOR</code> pops open to make my well-crafted message describing what changes I’m
making.</p>

<h4 id="git-fetch-rad-and-git-push-rad"><code>git fetch rad</code> and <code>git push rad</code></h4>

<p>This is going to be brief. All I do with <code>git</code> now is <code>git fetch rad</code> (or my
peer’s remotes) to fetch any new work in Radicle storage. For pushing I will use
<code>git push rad</code> to create or update patches (coming up), update my version of
<code>master</code>, and, on the rare occasion, push a branch. That’s it! No more <code>commit</code>,
no more <code>rebase</code>, no more <code>merge</code> – ok I still use <code>git log</code> – but that’s pretty
much it. So how did I ditch all of these commands? Let’s take a look <code>jj</code>.</p>

<h3 id="jujutsu-and-git">Jujutsu and Git</h3>

<p>Let’s see how I’m using <code>jj</code> by visiting several of its commands and seeing how
I can use them in different scenarios.</p>

<h4 id="jj-new"><code>jj new</code></h4>

<p>It’s only natural to start off with <code>jj new</code>. This command creates a new change
in <code>jj</code>, as well as creating a new, empty commit for that change. Whenever I’m
going to make a new change that’s based on the <code>master</code> branch, I run:</p>

<pre>$ jj new master@rad
Working copy  (@) now at: <span></span><span>qx</span><span>uvyurn</span><span> </span><span>8e</span><span>711a87</span><span> </span><span>(empty)</span><span> </span><span>(no description set)</span>
Parent commit (@-)      : <span></span><span>xsl</span><span>qmmsl</span> <span></span><span>62</span><span>cdaf6d</span> <span>master@rad</span><span> | </span>deployment: Vercel → Cloudflare Workers
Added 0 files, modified 0 files, removed 1 files
</pre>

<p>You’ll notice that <code>jj</code> spits out a Change ID and a Commit ID. You may also
notice that a prefix is highlighted – this is the unique prefix for the change
and the commit at this time! Which means that I can use <code>qx</code> or <code>8e</code> to refer to
this particular change or commit without any ambiguity; an amazing UX, if you
ask me.</p>

<p>At this point, I might know what I’m going to be working on so I use <code>jj
describe</code> to give this change a message.</p>

<pre>$ jj describe -m <span>"blog: Radicle and JJ"</span>
Working copy  (@) now at: <span></span><span>qx</span><span>uvyurn</span><span> </span><span>40</span><span>8133a5</span><span> </span><span>(empty)</span><span> blog: Radicle and JJ</span>
Parent commit (@-)      : <span></span><span>xsl</span><span>qmmsl</span> <span></span><span>62</span><span>cdaf6d</span> <span>master@rad</span><span> | </span>deployment: Vercel → Cloudflare Workers
</pre>

<p>I’ve now changed the description so that it no longer says <code>(no description
yet)</code>, and it now reads <code>blog: Radicle and JJ</code>.</p>

<p>So let’s see what we have here:</p>

<pre>$ jj show qx
Commit ID: <span>408133a5e54c80d2398be0c78cccabbd6063902d</span>
Change ID: <span>qxuvyurnqsvupzlpzsvzzpqlmlqvoxwq</span>
Author   : <span>Fintan Halpenny</span> &lt;<span>fintan.halpenny@radicle.xyz</span>&gt; (<span>2025-06-10 07:52:34</span>)
Committer: <span>Fintan Halpenny</span> &lt;<span>fintan.halpenny@radicle.xyz</span>&gt; (<span>2025-06-10 07:52:34</span>)

    blog: Radicle and JJ
</pre>

<p>We can see that it looks similar to a Git commit, which we can also inspect
using:</p>

<pre>$ git show 408133a5e54c80d2398be0c78cccabbd6063902d
<span>commit 408133a5e54c80d2398be0c78cccabbd6063902d</span>
Author: Fintan Halpenny &lt;fintan.halpenny@radicle.xyz&gt;
Date:   2025-06-10 07:52:34 +0200

    blog: Radicle and JJ
</pre>

<p>This leaves us in a position to do our usual changes within our working copy of
the Git repository.</p>

<p>At any point where I’m looking to separate changes, I can use <code>jj new</code> again,
specifying any change to make a new change after the given change:</p>

<pre>$ jj new qx
Working copy  (@) now at: <span></span><span>w</span><span>msmovxx</span><span> </span><span>c5</span><span>0301c1</span><span> </span><span>(empty)</span><span> </span><span>(no description set)</span>
Parent commit (@-)      : <span></span><span>qx</span><span>uvyurn</span> <span></span><span>40</span><span>8133a5</span> blog: Radicle and JJ
</pre>

<pre>$ jj describe -m <span>"blog: Radicle an JJ - add body"</span>
Working copy  (@) now at: <span></span><span>w</span><span>msmovxx</span><span> </span><span>a3</span><span>d195ad</span><span> </span><span>(empty)</span><span> blog: Radicle and JJ – add body</span>
Parent commit (@-)      : <span></span><span>qx</span><span>uvyurn</span> <span></span><span>40</span><span>8133a5</span> blog: Radicle and JJ
</pre>

<p>If I ever think I’m about to make some changes before the change I’m on, then I
can use the <code>-B</code> option:</p>

<pre>$ jj new -B @
Rebased 1 descendant commits
Working copy  (@) now at: <span></span><span>zv</span><span>rmpyox</span><span> </span><span>f0</span><span>635336</span><span> </span><span>(empty)</span><span> </span><span>(no description set)</span>

Added 0 files, modified 0 files, removed 1 files
</pre>

<h4 id="jj-edit"><code>jj edit</code></h4>

<p>At any point in time, I can also decide to go back to an old change and edit it,
specifying the change that I want to edit:</p>

<pre>$ jj edit qx
Working copy  (@) now at: <span></span><span>qx</span><span>uvyurn</span><span> </span><span>40</span><span>8133a5</span><span> blog: Radicle and JJ</span>
Parent commit (@-)      : <span></span><span>xsl</span><span>qmmsl</span> <span></span><span>62</span><span>cdaf6d</span> <span>master@rad</span><span> | </span>deployment: Vercel → Cloudflare Workers
</pre>

<p>You can now forget about all those <code>fixup!</code> commits you were making to add
changes into previous commits. No longer are you at the mercy of making a commit
that is ahead of some other changes and you need to reorder it using <code>git
rebase</code>. You taste that? It tastes like victory…</p>

<h4 id="jj-squash"><code>jj squash</code></h4>

<p>Ok, so you’ve made some changes that are not related to the current change? This
happens, or at least it does to me – I’m not perfect, (un)fortunately. I can use
the power of <code>jj new</code>, whether after or before the current change, and combine
it with <code>jj squash</code>:</p>

<pre>$ jj squash -u --from w --to qx
Rebased 1 descendant commits
Working copy  (@) now at: <span></span><span>qx</span><span>uvyurn</span><span> </span><span>1e</span><span>2b0ccc</span><span> </span><span>(empty)</span><span> blog: Radicle and JJ</span>
Parent commit (@-)      : <span></span><span>xsl</span><span>qmmsl</span> <span></span><span>62</span><span>cdaf6d</span> <span>master@rad</span><span> | </span>deployment: Vercel → Cloudflare Workers
</pre>

<p>This says that I’m squashing the changes from the change identified by <code>w</code> into
the change <code>qx</code>, and I want to keep the description of <code>qx</code> and drop the
description of <code>w</code> (the <code>-u</code> option).</p>

<p>For extra points, <code>jj</code> even includes the beautiful <code>-i</code> option for <em>choosing</em>
which changes you’re taking from the source change – via a TUI. I cannot
begin to describe how useful this is for moving around file changes and keeping
my history clean and linear.</p>

<h4 id="jj-rebase"><code>jj rebase</code></h4>

<p>The final piece of the puzzle, at least for my workflow, is <code>jj rebase</code>. I can
move around changes and put them on top of a destination change:</p>

<pre>$ jj rebase -d qx -r sm
Working copy  (@) now at: <span></span><span>sm</span><span>vvuqzo</span><span> </span><span>42</span><span>0180e8</span> blog: relevant blog material
Parent commit (@-)      : <span></span><span>qx</span><span>uvyurn</span> <span></span><span>1e</span><span>2b0ccc</span> blog: Radicle and JJ
Added 1 files, modified 0 files, removed 0 files
</pre>

<p>This rebases the change <code>sm</code> onto the change <code>qx</code>. In fact, the <code>-r</code> can take a
set of changes (see <a href="https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/v0.30.0/revsets">revsets</a>) and graft them all on top of the
destination.</p>

<h4 id="my-jjconfig">My <code>.jj/config</code></h4>

<p>The final part I’ll touch on is my <code>jj</code> config, which can be split into the user
and repo config. Thanks to Bruno, who wrote a lot of this on Zulip, and I
cribbed it from him.</p>

<h5 id="user-config">User Config</h5>

<p>Here is my user config, and we’ll discuss a couple of the entries, and I’ll
leave the rest as homework.</p>

</code></pre></div>

<ul>
  <li><code>fresh</code>: this allows me to have an alias for <code>jj new master@rad</code> and use <code>jj
fresh</code>.</li>
  <li><code>tug</code>: this allows me to tug the closest <a href="https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/v0.30.0/bookmarks">bookmark</a> to a change
that can be pushed – we’ll see an example of this later.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="repository-config">Repository Config</h5>

<p>And here is my repository config, which we’ll discuss a bit more in detail.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>[revset-aliases]</span>
<span>"trunk()"</span> <span>=</span> <span>"master@rad"</span>
<span>"immutable_heads()"</span> <span>=</span> <span>"present(trunk()) | </span><span>\
</span><span>    tags() | </span><span>\
</span><span>    ( </span><span>\
</span><span>        untracked_remote_bookmarks() ~ </span><span>\
</span><span>        untracked_remote_bookmarks(remote='rad') ~ </span><span>\
</span><span>        untracked_remote_bookmarks(regex:'^patch(es)/',remote='rad') </span><span>\
</span><span>    )"</span>

<span>[git]</span>
<span>write-change-id-header</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>We want to change the <code>trunk()</code> alias from its default in <code>jj</code> so that it points
to <code>master@rad</code>, the default branch in this particular Radicle repository. The
<code>trunk()</code> revset is used in a few place, for example, we saw it above in
<code>fresh</code>, but it is also in the next revset alias.</p>

<p>Some changes in <code>jj</code> will be marked as <a href="https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/v0.30.0/config/#set-of-immutable-commits">immutable</a>. <code>jj</code>
will prevent you from changing certain changes if they are marked as immutable,
and its default value for this can be very restrictive, so instead we change it
here. First we mark changes that are <code>present</code> in <code>trunk()</code> or <code>tags()</code> as
immutable. Then we have untracked remote bookmarks with the set difference
operator <code>~</code>. What are not marking as immutable are bookmarks that are in <code>rad</code>
or that <code>patch</code>/<code>patches</code>. That is, if the changes are ours or from patches,
then they’re safe to edit. You might think, “Why are patches safe?”” Well, let’s
finally get into Radicle and Jujutsu.</p>

<h3 id="radicle-and-jujutsu">Radicle and Jujutsu</h3>

<p>So here we are, a lot of build up to get to the point where I can describe how I
can avoid using branches (as much as possible).</p>

<h4 id="contributing-patches">Contributing Patches</h4>

<p>We will first dive into contributing a new patch using Radicle. As described in
<a href="#jujutsu-and-git">Jujutsu and Git</a>, I can start making a set of changes using
<code>jj new</code>, editing them just how I like using <code>jj edit</code>, and ordering them just
the way I want with <code>jj rebase</code> and <code>jj squash</code>. During this whole time, I’m in
that, initially scary, <a href="https://wizardzines.com/comics/detached-head-state/">detached HEAD state</a>. Here it comes,
we’re going to make a patch!</p>

<h5 id="creating-a-new-patch">Creating a New Patch</h5>



<p>That’s it. Well, the <code>$EDITOR</code> opens and I write a title and a body describing
my wonderful changes, and when I’m done, the remote helper will create the patch
and announce it to the network.</p>

<pre><span>✓</span> Patch <span>e5f0a5a5adaa33c3b931235967e4930ece9bb617</span> opened
<span>✓</span> Synced with <span>8</span> node(s)

To rad://z3cyotNHuasWowQ2h4yF9c3tFFdvc/z6MkvZwzK64f3GuDcAs6dEcje89ddfHkBjS1v9Dkh7aCGq3C
 * [new reference]   HEAD -&gt; refs/patches
</pre>

<h5 id="updating-a-patch">Updating a Patch</h5>

<p>Let’s be honest though, my wonderful changes are rarely wonderful from the
get-go. They need some polishing, and my peers always have great suggestions
that I should integrate into the patch.</p>

<p>From here, I can find the patch using <code>rad patch</code>:</p>

<span>│ </span>This patch is an implementation of RIP-0004. It implements the rules mechanism                                                                  <span> │</span>
<span>│ </span>within the `rules` module. This is interplays with the existing `canonical`                                                                     <span> │</span>
<span>│ </span>mechanisms, already defined (but slightly refactored).                                                                                          <span> │</span>
<span>│ </span>                                                                                                                                                <span> │</span>
<span>│ </span>The `rules` are then used in pushing and fetching references. A test is added to                                                                <span> │</span>
<span>│ </span>illustrate the canonical references in action via tags.                                                                                         <span> │</span>
<span>│ </span>                                                                                                                                                <span> │</span>
<span>│ </span>There were some incidental changes that were made to ensure the tags use case is                                                                <span> │</span>
<span>│ </span>easy for users. The first change was to add a tags refspec to remotes in order                                                                  <span> │</span>
<span>│ </span>to easily fetch tags from peers -- as well ensuring those tags do not pollute                                                                   <span> │</span>
<span>│ </span>the `refs/tags` namespace in the working copy.                                                                                                  <span> │</span>
<span>│ </span>                                                                                                                                                <span> │</span>
<span>│ </span>This had a knock on change where there was a bug `libgit2` that didn't allow for                                                                <span> │</span>
<span>│ </span>deleting `multivar` entries, which the new remote setup fell under. This was                                                                    <span> │</span>
<span>│ </span>fixed and so we update to `git2-0.19`.                                                                                                          <span> │</span>
<span>│ </span>                                                                                                                                                <span> │</span>
<span>│ </span>As well this, the `rad id update` command would error if the payload identifier                                                                 <span> │</span>
<span>│ </span>was not the project identifier. This would stop adding new payloads to extend                                                                   <span> │</span>
<span>│ </span>the identity -- which was needed for introducing canonical references.                                                                          <span> │</span>

<p>You can see here how non-perfect my changes are, I’m being vulnerable here.</p>

<p>I can now grab the value <code>Head</code> in the above table, and use it in <code>jj</code>, by
running <code>jj new 34014a67b0ddc859d95e17ffc71c1ae61aff5758</code>. This will drop me
onto a new change after <code>34014a67b0ddc859d95e17ffc71c1ae61aff5758</code>, and then I
can use <code>jj log -r ::@</code> to see all the previous changes.</p>

<p>Again, I use the wonderful <code>jj edit</code> command, or perhaps I make new changes that
I then <code>jj squash</code> into the relevant changes – it all depends on the scope of
the change!</p>

<p>Once I’m done, I push <code>HEAD</code> to another special <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-The-Refspec">refspec</a>, using
the patch’s full identifier:</p>

<div><pre><code>git push rad HEAD:patches/c54883e5ffb1f8a99f432e3ac79c0b728cd0dab3 <span>-f</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>We use <code>-f</code> if we are editing the changes since this will change the underlying
commits and <code>git</code> will reject this. Once again, this will open my <code>$EDITOR</code> and
I will add a message about the changes that were made in this update.</p>

<p>This creates a new “revision” for the patch, preserving the older revisions.
So essentially, patches in Radicle are append-only. This makes it safe for us to
make edits to changes, marking them as mutable – the Git history will be
preserved!</p>

<h4 id="maintaining-patches">Maintaining Patches</h4>

<p>From the maintaining perspective, the flow starts off similar to updating, where
I would look up the patch that I want to merge. If I made the patch, things are
a bit easier because the Git objects are easily accessible and I can do <code>jj new</code>
using the commit. If I attempt to do this with a patch that came from another
contributor, then I may run into this issue:</p>

<pre>$ jj new 7322e3ac61669ba6dbde16bb0f7d30edf1ee85ce
<span></span><span>Error: </span><span>Revision `7322e3ac61669ba6dbde16bb0f7d30edf1ee85ce` doesn't exist</span>
</pre>

<p>The way to do this instead, is to use the remote syntax and the special
<code>patches</code> reference:</p>

<pre>$ jj new patches/3219ef871dd44c7ef51693f4aeba4c2c5c0c5c7b@rad
Working copy  (@) now at: <span></span><span>oo</span><span>xzsqoy</span><span> </span><span>eb</span><span>9e0803</span><span> </span><span>(empty)</span><span> </span><span>(no description set)</span>
Parent commit (@-)      : <span></span><span>s</span><span>wpyssrk</span> <span></span><span>73</span><span>22e3ac</span> <span>patches/3219ef871dd44c7ef51693f4aeba4c2c5c0c5c7b patches/3219ef871dd44c7ef51693f4aeba4c2c5c0c5c7b@rad</span><span> | </span>node, cli: remove predefined bootstrap nodes
</pre>

<p>At this point, I can also look at what commits are in the patch via <code>rad patch
show</code>, or by using <code>jj log -r ::@</code>. If they’re already on top <code>master@rad</code>, then
to merge the patch I can simply <code>git push rad master</code> – and the remote helper
marks the patch as merged if the canonical reference of <code>master</code> is update (a
topic for another time).</p>

<p>If the patch isn’t on top of <code>master@rad</code> then I can rebase the changes using
<code>jj rebase -d master@rad -r &lt;base&gt;::&lt;head&gt;</code> to get the series of changes on top
of our latest. It’s then necessary to push a new revision to the patch so that
the patch can know it is being merged with the new commits – remember that I
rebased, so this changes the underlying commits.</p>

<p>We should update our <code>master</code> bookmark, and this is where the <code>tug</code> alias comes
in. When I run <code>jj tug</code>, it figures out that <code>master</code> is the closest bookmark
and pulls it up to the latest change that can be pushed. I can then push to
update the patch:</p>

<div><pre><code>git push rad master:patches/3219ef871dd44c7ef51693f4aeba4c2c5c0c5c7b <span>-f</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Here I’m using <code>master</code> instead of <code>HEAD</code> – this gets around a little issue I’ve
been seeing for patches that I do not own, where the remote helper rejects the
push because it cannot resolve <code>HEAD</code> (a mystery left for another day).</p>

<p>Once the patch has been rebased, I can do the usual <code>git push rad master</code> to
update the canonical reference and have the patch marked as merged.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>And our adventure ends here. We dived into how Radicle works with Git, how
Jujutsu works Git, and how I use Jujutsu to have a branch-less flow in Radicle.
This is has been a dream to work with. This type of tooling feels like it
enables me a lot more when managing my changes and keeping a clean history. I
was <em>able</em> to do this with <code>git rebase</code>, but it felt like it got in the way more
than it enabled me – and I haven’t even touched on how <a href="https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/v0.30.0/conflicts">conflicts</a>
are easy in Jujutsu!</p>

<p>There is plenty of room for improvements here, some things on my list are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Keeping track of Jujutsu change IDs in Radicle data, which is already being
looked at!</li>
  <li>Not needing to use <code>rad patch show</code> to get metadata for managing patches, and
perhaps even bookmarking patch identifiers automatically.</li>
</ul>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.seangoedecke.com/real-reasoning/">https://www.seangoedecke.com/real-reasoning/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44900340">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><header></header><section><p>Reading research papers and articles about chain-of-thought reasoning<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup> makes me frustrated.</p>
<p>There are many interesting questions to ask about chain-of-thought: how accurately it reflects the actual process going on, why training it “from scratch” often produces chains that switch fluidly between multiple languages, and so on. However, people keep asking the least interesting question possible: <strong>whether chain-of-thought reasoning is “really” reasoning</strong>.</p>
<p>Apple took up this question in their <a href="https://www.seangoedecke.com/illusion-of-thinking">Illusion of Thinking</a> paper, which I’ve already written about. Now there’s a <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01191">paper</a> from Arizona State University that’s getting some attention called <em>Is Chain-of-Thought Reasoning of LLMs a Mirage?</em> As will become clear, I do not think this is a very good paper.</p>
<h3>What does the Arizona State paper argue?</h3>
<p>Here’s the core point:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>CoT reasoning works effectively when applied to in-distribution or near in-distribution data but becomes fragile and prone to failure even under moderate distribution shifts. In some cases, LLMs generate fluent yet logically inconsistent reasoning steps. The results suggest that what appears to be structured reasoning can be a mirage, emerging from memorized or interpolated
patterns in the training data rather than logical inference.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The strategy of the paper is to train a small transformer model (~600k params) on a corpus of non-language data transformations. What does this mean? As far as I can tell, that when prompted with something like “A B C D [M1]”, the model should respond “B C D E”, if the “M1” operation in training data means “advance each letter forward by one”<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup>. The training data contained several kinds of operation, which were composed arbitrarily (e.g. “A B C D [M1] [M1]” should produce “C D E F”). Finally, the training data included chains-of-thought like:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>A B C D [M1] [M1]
&lt;think&gt;
B C D E [M1]
&lt;/think&gt;
C D E F</code></pre></div>
<p>Overall, the idea is to teach the model a very simple way of expressing chains-of-thought to solve toy alphabet problems, which has the good effect of making it trivial to determine at scale if and when the model made a mistake in its reasoning. You can straightforwardly generate ten thousand completions and then algorithmically check the model’s work, which is what the paper did.</p>
<p>The paper draws all kinds of conclusions from these reasoning traces: </p>
<ul>
<li>When a requested reasoning path (like ”[M1] [K1]”) doesn’t appear in the training data (even though the individual “M1” and “K1” operations do), their model struggled to actually perform the operations requested instead of outputting a similar path that was in the training data.</li>
<li>When the requested reasoning path is even a little bit longer than those in the training data, performance drops noticeably.</li>
<li>Any changes (even minor ones) to the format, like adding a meaningless “noise” token, cause the model to make many more mistakes.</li>
<li>The model can be rapidly fine-tuned to cope with any of these issues, but that only addresses the specific pattern being fine-tuned for.</li>
</ul>
<p>From all this, the paper concludes that model chain-of-thought reasoning does not operate out-of-distribution, and is instead just copying specific reasoning patterns that occurred in the training data.</p>
<h3>What do I think about it?</h3>
<p>I don’t like it. I am unconvinced that you can draw broad conclusions about reasoning models from the toy example in this paper, for a few reasons.</p>
<h4>Reasoning and language</h4>
<p>The first is that <strong>reasoning probably requires language use</strong>. Even if you don’t think AI models can “really” reason - more on that later - even simulated reasoning <em>has to be reasoning in human language</em>. Reasoning model traces are full of phrases like “wait, what if we tried” and “I’m not certain, but let’s see if” and “great, so we know for sure that X, now let’s consider Y”. In other words, reasoning is a sophisticated task that requires a sophisticated tool like human language.</p>
<p>Why is that? Because reasoning tasks require choosing between several different options. “A B C D [M1] -&gt; B C D E” isn’t reasoning, it’s <strong>computation</strong>, because it has no mechanism for thinking “oh, I went down the wrong track, let me try something else”. That’s why the most important token in AI reasoning models is “Wait”. In fact, you can control how long a reasoning model thinks by arbitrarily <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19393">appending</a> “Wait” to the chain-of-thought. Actual reasoning models change direction all the time, but this paper’s toy example is structurally incapable of it.</p>
<h4>Model size</h4>
<p>The second problem is that <strong>the model is just too small</strong>. Reasoning models are a pretty recent innovation, but the idea is pretty obvious. Why is that? I’m pretty sure it’s because (prior to September 2024) the models were just not smart enough to reason. You couldn’t have built a reasoning model on top of GPT-3.5 - there’s just not enough raw brainpower there to perform the relevant operations, like holding multiple possible solutions “in memory” at the same time.</p>
<p>In other words, a 600k parameter model is smart enough to learn how to apply transformations in sequence, but not necessarily smart enough to decompose those transformations into their individual components. I appreciate that research has to be done on small models, but we <em>know</em> that reasoning is an emergent capability! Even if you grant that what they’re measuring is reasoning, I am profoundly unconvinced that their results will generalize to a 1B, 10B or 100B model.</p>
<h4>How do humans reason?</h4>
<p>Even if both of my previous objections were invalid, this paper would still not justify its grandiose conclusions about a “mirage” of reasoning, because <strong>it does not compare to how humans actually reason</strong>. Here are some quotes from the paper:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>LLMs construct superficial chains of logic based on learned token associations, often failing on tasks that deviate from commonsense heuristics or familiar templates
Models often incorporate … irrelevant details into their reasoning, revealing a lack of sensitivity to salient information
models may overthink easy problems and give up on harder ones
Together, these findings suggest that LLMs are not principled reasoners but rather sophisticated simulators of reasoning-like text</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I want to tear my hair out when I read quotes like these, because <em>all of these statements are true of human reasoners</em>. Humans rely on heuristics and templates, include irrelevant details, overthink easy problems, and give up on hard ones all the time! The big claim in the paper - that reasoning models struggle when they’re out of domain - is true about even the strongest human reasoners as well. </p>
<p><strong>The “principled reasoner” being compared to here simply does not exist.</strong> It’s a Platonic ideal. If you compared the messy way even very intelligent humans reason in practice to this ideal, they would fail as well. It’s almost a cliche that human experts can reason magnificently in their field, but fall apart entirely when reasoning outside of their field<sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup>. Why would we be surprised that reasoning models reason like humans do, when they’re trained on large quantities of human or human-like reasoning text?</p>
<h3>Final thoughts</h3>
<p>Whether AI reasoning is “real” reasoning or just a mirage can be an interesting question, but it is primarily a <em>philosophical</em> question. It depends on having a clear definition of what “real” reasoning is, exactly. I’ve been out of the philosophy game for a while now, but I was in it long enough to know that there is no single consensus definition of ideal reasoning, and any candidate definitions run into serious problems very quickly. It’s not something you can handwave away in the introduction section of a machine learning paper.</p>
<p>I think the idea of training a toy model to do something kind of like reasoning is a really interesting strategy. If the <em>Is Chain-of-Thought Reasoning of LLMs a Mirage?</em> paper had just been about that, I would have no problem with it. But these papers keep stapling on broad philosophical claims about whether models can “really reason” that are just completely unsupported by the content of the research.</p>
<p>I suggest the following heuristic when you’re reading a paper about model reasoning:</p>
<ol>
<li>If it claims that AI reasoning is somehow “fake”, check for a section where it (at minimum) directly assesses the quality of human reasoning skills, or ideally provides a tight philosophical definition of what “real” reasoning is.</li>
<li>If it points at reasoning tasks that AI models fail at, check the task itself to see if it’s a task that actually requires reasoning (i.e. considering multiple approaches) or if it simply requires <em>computation</em> (following a set algorithm).</li>
</ol>
<p>Good model reasoning papers<sup id="fnref-4"><a href="#fn-4">4</a></sup> pass both these conditions. Even though they’re skeptical of the power of chain-of-thought, they use tasks that have many paths to success (like mathematics or language puzzles), and they don’t draw sweeping conclusions about “real” reasoning.</p>

		<div>
<p>Judge Carlos Mendoza of the U.S. Middle District Court of Florida has ruled in favor of the plaintiffs in a major case related to book banning in the state. The 50-page decision, <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69110142/129/penguin-random-house-llc-v-gibson/">available here</a>, states that the law used to pull books from Florida public schools is “overbroad and unconstitutional.” </p>

<p>Since its passage in 2023, Florida schools have removed hundreds of books under House Bill 1069 (HB 1069). HB 1069 required that school librarians remove materials from their collections that contain “sexual content,” regardless of the value of the book. It also allowed parents or county residents to raise objections to material, which then would need to be removed within five days of the objection and remain unavailable until the book was formally reviewed. The bill laid out no necessary timeline for review of material, nor did it require that material be returned to shelves, even following formal review.  </p>
</div><div>
<p>Penguin Random House, alongside five other publishers; the Authors Guild; authors Julia Alvarez, Laurie Halse Anderson, John Green, Jodi Picoult, and Angie Thomas; two students; and two parents filed a lawsuit against Florida public officials in August 2024, claiming that the parts of HB 1069 that applied to books permitted widespread removal of materials from schools and were in violation of the First Amendment. The bill led to the removal of books without regard to their literary or artistic value. Trainings by the Florida Department of Education further encouraged school librarians to “err on the side of caution” when it came to materials in the collection, noting that if their libraries had materials with “sexual conduct,” it could lead to punishment.</p>

<p>“The judge’s order makes it clear that we cannot judge a book by its cover or a maliciously selected excerpt out of context,” said Stephana Ferrell of the <a href="https://www.fftrp.org/">Florida Freedom to Read Project</a>. “This means that the thousands of books that have been prohibited from student access without careful consideration of their value should be returned to shelves immediately. Florida cannot call itself the “freest state” while it blatantly violates the First Amendment rights of our youngest citizens.”</p>

<p>Dan Novak, attorney for the plaintiffs, called the decision “a complete knockout. There’s not a single issue that the court did not side with the plaintiffs on,” <a href="https://archive.ph/FfLsc">per the Orlando Sentinel</a>. </p>

</p>
			</div>
<p>There are two key pieces in Judge Mendoza’s ruling worth highlighting. The first applies to where and how “sexual conduct” is considered in the context of the material being evaluated. Where HB 1069 encouraged removal of any material with “sexual conduct”–a phrase with no specific parameters, per the state–the ruling emphasizes that materials are to be judged by the prevailing Supreme Court standard known as the Miller Test. The Miller Test requires review of the materials <em>as a whole</em>, rather than through passages or excerpts. This applies even when reviewing materials for children, an argument that <a href="https://bookriot.com/the-lie-of-local-control-in-book-censorship/">Florida officials have been leaning into</a> (with precedent being the <em>Ginsberg v. New York).</em></p>

<p>Judge Mendoza writes: </p>






	

<blockquote>
<p>By leaving these items undefined, Florida has given parents license to object<br>to materials under an “I know it when I see it” approach. Jacobellis v. Ohio, 378<br>U.S. 184, 197 (1964) (Stewart, J. concurring). There is a reason that was not the<br>standard the Supreme Court adopted for defining obscenity then. See id. at 191<br>(majority opinion); see also HM Fla.-ORL, LLC, 137 F.4th at 1213 (“An ‘I know it when I see it’ test would unconstitutionally empower those who would limit speech to arbitrarily enforce the law. But the First Amendment empowers speakers instead.”).</p>



<p>Here, neither a prohibition on content that “describes sexual conduct” nor that<br>which is allegedly “pornographic” takes the third Miller prong into account. Both prohibitions lack the specificity required in identifying obscene material. Given that obscene material as to minors is already prohibited under Florida law, these terms must, therefore, target non-obscene material.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This reiterates points made by intellectual freedom advocates over the last several years: there are not obscene materials for minors available in school nor public libraries. Such materials are illegal and not available to distribute nor purchase for those institutions. </p>
</div><div>
<p>A second key component of this ruling is on whether or not regulating books in school libraries constituted “government speech.” Officials for the state argued that they were empowered to make decisions about the materials in those collections because it constituted “government speech” and thus, was not subject to the First Amendment. </p>

<p>Judge Mendoza disagreed. </p>

<p>“A blanket content-based prohibition on materials, rather than one based on individualized curation, hardly expresses any intentional government message at all. Slapping the label of government speech on book removals only serves to stifle the disfavored viewpoints,” he wrote. While parents have the right to object to “direct the upbringing and education of children,” the government cannot then “repackage their speech and pass it off as its own.”</p>

<p>It is unclear at this point what this ruling means for the hundreds of books that were banned from Florida schools under HB 1069, other than those removals were flagrant violations of the First Amendment. Over the last several weeks, Florida’s State Board of Education has threatened public schools into <a href="https://bookriot.com/55-books-banned-in-florida-schools/">removing dozens of books they deem “patently pornographic,”</a> and at least nine districts have agreed to pulling those titles without review.  </p>

<p>What or where this ruling will come into play in other states which have passed laws allowing them to remove books deemed “inappropriate” from public schools is also unclear. Judge Mendoza referenced numerous titles that were pulled from Florida schools, stating that those books did not meet the legal definition of “obscene” per the Miller Test. Many of those books are titles which have been banned in states like <a href="https://bookriot.com/utah-bans-18th-book-from-all-public-schools-statewide/">Utah</a> and <a href="https://bookriot.com/south-carolina-bans-10-more-books-from-all-public-schools-state-wide/">South Carolina</a>. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Plaintiffs have established multiple unconstitutional applications of the<br>statutory provisions at issue. The following books, among others, have been<br>removed: <em>The Color Purple, Half of a Yellow Sun, Cloud Atlas, The Splendid and<br>the Vile, I am Not Your Perfect Mexican Daughter, The Freedom Writers Diary:<br>How a Teacher and 150 Teens Used Writing to Change Themselves and the World Around Them, On the Road, Nineteen Minutes, Paper Towns, Looking for Alaska, How the García Girls Lost Their Accents, The Kite Runner, Slaughterhouse-Five, Shout, Last Night at the Telegraph Club, The Handmaid’s Tale, Native Son, Kaffir Boy: The True Story of a Black Youth’s Coming of Age in Apartheid South Africa, Water for Elephants, Beloved, Song of Solomon, The Bluest Eye</em>, and <em>Homegoing</em>. None of these books are obscene.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As of writing, Florida officials have not yet responded to the ruling. It wouldn’t be surprising to see an appeal in the case. </p>

<p>“While we fully expect an appeal, we encourage state leaders to think about future Civics lessons and whether or not they will be on the right side of history arguing against the rights of its citizens,” said Ferrell.</p>

<p>There are still several major lawsuits underway related to book bans both in Florida and elsewhere in the US. This win is significant, especially in Florida, and may help pave the way for further victories. </p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>One of the things I have spent a lot of time doing is interviewing software engineers. This is obviously a hard task, and I don’t claim to have a magic solution; but it’s given me some time to reflect on what effective software engineers actually do.</p>
<h2 id="the-software-engineering-loop"><a href="#the-software-engineering-loop" aria-label="Copy heading link"><span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="10" height="10" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><line x1="4" x2="20" y1="9" y2="9"></line><line x1="4" x2="20" y1="15" y2="15"></line><line x1="10" x2="8" y1="3" y2="21"></line><line x1="16" x2="14" y1="3" y2="21"></line></svg></span><span>The Software Engineering Loop</span></a></h2>
<p>When you watch someone who knows what they are doing, you'll see them looping over the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Build a mental model of the requirements</li>
<li>Write code that (hopefully?!) does that</li>
<li>Build a mental model of what the code actually does</li>
<li>Identify the differences, and update the code (or the requirements).</li>
</ol>
<p>There are lots of different ways to do these things, but the distinguishing factor of effective engineers is their ability to build and maintain clear mental models.</p>
<h2 id="how-about-llms"><a href="#how-about-llms" aria-label="Copy heading link"><span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="10" height="10" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><line x1="4" x2="20" y1="9" y2="9"></line><line x1="4" x2="20" y1="15" y2="15"></line><line x1="10" x2="8" y1="3" y2="21"></line><line x1="16" x2="14" y1="3" y2="21"></line></svg></span><span>How about LLMs?</span></a></h2>
<p>To be fair, LLMs are quite good at writing code. They're also reasonably good at updating code when you identify the problem to fix. They can also do all the things that real software engineers do: read the code, write and run tests, add logging, and (presumably) use a debugger.</p>
<p>But what they cannot do is maintain clear mental models.</p>
<p>LLMs get endlessly confused: they assume the code they wrote actually works; when test fail, they are left guessing as to whether to fix the code or the tests; and when it gets frustrating, they just delete the whole lot and start over.</p>
<p>This is exactly the opposite of what I am looking for.</p>
<p>Software engineers test their work as they go. When tests fail, they can check in with their mental model to decide whether to fix the code or the tests, or just to gather more data before making a decision. When they get frustrated, they can reach for help by talking things through. And although sometimes they do delete it all and start over, they do so with a clearer understanding of the problem.</p>

<p>Will this change as models become more capable? Perhaps?? But I think it's going to require a change in how models are built and optimized. Software engineering requires models that can do more than just generate code.</p>
<p>When a person runs into a problem, they are able to temporarily stash the full context, focus on resolving the issue, and then pop their mental stack to get back to the problem in hand. They are also able to zoom out and focus on the big picture, allowing the details to temporarily disappear, diving into small pieces as necessary. We don't just keep adding more words to our context window, because it would drive us mad.</p>
<p>Even if it wasn't just too much context to deal with, we know that current generative models suffer from several issues that directly impact their ability to maintain clear mental models:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Context omission</strong>: <a href="https://xinjie-shen.com/post/llmfail2acquirecontext/">Models are bad at finding omitted context</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Recency bias</strong>: <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.20612v1">They suffer a strong recency bias</a> in the context window.</li>
<li><strong>Hallucination</strong>: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11817">They commonly hallucinate</a> details that should not be there.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are hopefully not insurmountable problems, and work is being done on adding <a href="https://research.ibm.com/blog/memory-augmented-LLMs">memory</a> to let them perform similar mental tricks to us.
Unfortunately, for now, they cannot (<a href="https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/illusion-of-thinking">beyond a certain complexity</a>) actually understand what is going on.</p>
<p>They cannot build software because they cannot maintain two similar "mental models", identify the differences, and figure out whether or not to update the code or the requirements.</p>
<h2 id="so-what-now"><a href="#so-what-now" aria-label="Copy heading link"><span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="10" height="10" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><line x1="4" x2="20" y1="9" y2="9"></line><line x1="4" x2="20" y1="15" y2="15"></line><line x1="10" x2="8" y1="3" y2="21"></line><line x1="16" x2="14" y1="3" y2="21"></line></svg></span><span>So, what now?</span></a></h2>
<p>Clearly LLMs are useful to software engineers. They can quickly generate code, and they are excellent at synthesizing requirements and documentation. For some tasks this is enough: the requirements are clear enough, and the problems are simple enough, that they can one-shot the whole thing.</p>
<p>That said, for anything non-trivial, they are not capable of maintaining enough context accurately enough to iterate to a working solution. You, the software engineer, are responsible for ensuring that the requirements are clear, and that the code actually does what it purports to do.</p>
<p>At Zed we believe in a world where people and agents can collaborate together to build software. But, we firmly believe that (at least for now) you are in the drivers seat, and the LLM is just another tool to reach for.</p><hr></article></div>]]></description>

Led by Principal Investigator Dr. Noah A. Smith, Senior Director of NLP Research at Ai2 and Amazon Professor of Machine Learning at the University of Washington’s Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science &amp; Engineering, OMAI will build a national level fully open AI ecosystem to drive scientific discovery through AI, while also advancing the science of AI itself.</p><p>The project will also support the University of Washington (co-PI: Hanna Hajishirzi, PhD), the University of Hawai’i at Hilo (co-PI: Travis Mandel, PhD), the University of New Hampshire (co-PI: Samuel Carton, PhD), and the University of New Mexico (co-PI: Sarah Dreier, PhD).</p><p>Our cloud computing partner, Cirrascale Cloud Services, will provide managed services for the new hardware infrastructure funded by the support, helping us push the boundaries of AI for science. Supermicro will supply its industry-leading platforms to support the partnership.</p><p>As a non-profit leader in fully open AI models and solutions that are reproducible and shared along with data, code, evaluations, and documentation, we’re uniquely positioned to advance American AI for the scientific community. <a href="https://allenai.org/olmo">OLMo</a> is our family of high‑performance open text models, and <a href="https://allenai.org/blog/molmo">Molmo</a> is our series of open, industry‑leading multimodal language models.</p><p>The support from NSF and NVIDIA will provide critical AI infrastructure that will enable Ai2 to advance the science of AI and AI for science.</p><p>”This award marks a significant moment for truly open, scientific AI,” said Smith. “At Ai2, with our academic collaborators, we’re building an ecosystem where world-class models like OLMo and Molmo are powerful tools to augment the work of experts, but are also fully transparent, reproducible, and most importantly, available to all. Open development of AI is essential to scientific progress, national competitiveness, and global trust in AI-based solutions that will serve humanity. We’re proud to lead that charge with support from NVIDIA and NSF.”</p><p>While the AI ecosystem continues to grow, many models aren’t fully open—they rely on closed data and can’t be inspected to ensure that they’re robust for high‑stakes applications. By contrast, our models are released with all of the components needed to analyze, modify, and fine-tune them, or even train them from scratch.&nbsp;</p><p>"Bringing AI into scientific research has been a game changer," said Brian Stone, performing the duties of the NSF director. "NSF is proud to partner with NVIDIA to equip America's scientists with the tools to accelerate breakthroughs. These investments are not just about enabling innovation; they are about securing U.S. global leadership in science and technology and tackling challenges once thought impossible."</p><p>We see this partnership as accelerating a truly open technology ecosystem—led by Ai2—with broad positive impact, powered by American investment and ingenuity. With this support, we’ll produce leading open multimodal models, resources, and tools that help ensure America’s leadership in AI, building on the strong foundation we set with OLMo and Molmo.</p><p><a href="https://www.nsf.gov/news/nsf-nvidia-partnership-enables-ai2-develop-fully-open-ai"><strong>Read the full press release</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><hr><p><strong>About Ai2:</strong></p><p>Ai2 is a Seattle-based nonprofit AI research institute and 501(c)(3) organization that seeks to build breakthrough AI to solve the world’s biggest problems.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-ASI-Lower-Overhead">https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-ASI-Lower-Overhead</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44899488">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><img alt="LINUX SECURITY" src="https://www.phoronix.com/assets/categories/linuxsecurity.webp" width="100" height="100"></p><p>
Several years ago Google engineers began exploring address space isolation for the Linux kernel and ultimately proposing <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/Google-LPC-ASI-2022">Linux ASI for better dealing with CPU speculative execution attacks</a>. While the hope was it would better cope with the ever growing list of CPU speculative execution vulnerabilities, the effort was thwarted initially by <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/Google-Linux-ASI-v2-RFC-Patches">I/O throughput seeing a 70% performance hit</a>. That level of performance cost was unsustainable. But now that I/O overhead has been reduced to <em>just</em> 13%.
</p><p>
Google engineer Brendan Jackman is back to bringing up ASI to Linux kernel developers now that "<em>ASI is fast again...I've now prepared an up-to-date ASI branch that demonstrates a technique for solving the page cache performance devastation...The goal of this prototype is to increase confidence that ASI is viable as a broad solution for CPU vulnerabilities. (If the community still has to develop and maintain new mitigations for every individual vuln, because ASI only works for certain use-cases, then ASI isn't super attractive given its complexity burden). The biggest gap for establishing that confidence was that Google's deployment still only uses ASI for KVM workloads, not bare-metal processes. And indeed the page cache turned out to be a massive issue that Google just hasn't run up against yet internally.</em>"
</p><p><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=2022&amp;image=google_asi_3_med" alt="ASI slide"></p>
<p>Random reads with FIO were still hit by a 13% regression but at least better than 70%. ASI in current form also increased Linux kernel compilation times by 6~7%. Jackman added:
</p><blockquote>"Despite my title these numbers are kinda disappointing to be honest, it's not where I wanted to be by now, but it's still an order-of-magnitude better than where we were for native FIO a few months ago. I believe almost all of this remaining slowdown is due to unnecessary ASI exits, the key areas being:
<p>
- On every context_switch(). Google's internal implementation has fixed this (we only really need it when switching mms).
</p><p>
- Whenever zeroing sensitive pages from the allocator. This could potentially be solved with the ephmap but requires a bit of care to avoid opening CPU attack windows.
</p><p>
- In copy-on-write for user pages. The ephmap could also help here but the current implementation doesn't support it (it only allows one allocation at a   time per context)."</p></blockquote>
<p>With <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20250812173109.295750-1-jackmanb@google.com/T/#u">this LKML thread</a> the hope now is to figure out if the state is improving good enough that the ASI work can move forward for potentially upstreaming into the Linux kernel.

<!-- %h3 About -->
<p>Enter the fascinating world of corruption, chicanery, low-tech fraud, and forensic tools that uncover it. The story is told through the eyes of a Russian election official who has participated in campaigns of all levels in the past 4 years and fought for justice (mostly unsuccessfully). Watch a demo how to tamper with a security bag and learn how to use statistics to detect ballot stuffing [1]. See the obstacles faced by Russians wanting a change. See how the government “wins” the elections.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>University of Maryland School of Medicine (UMSOM) researchers, along with their colleagues, engineered a new molecule that appears promising as an effective antidote for carbon monoxide poisoning with fewer side effects than other molecules currently being tested, according to a <strong><a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2501389122">new study published in the journal PNAS</a></strong>.</p>
<p><span><img src="https://www.medschool.umaryland.edu/media/som/news/2022/images/GLADWIN250.jpg" alt="Mark T. Gladwin, MD">Carbon monoxide poisoning accounts for 50,000 emergency room visits in the U.S. each year and causes about 1,500 deaths. These deaths may occur when carbon monoxide released from combustion builds up in an enclosed space, which can result from ventilation failures in indoor natural gas burning equipment, or running gasoline generators or automobiles indoors or in a closed garage. Carbon monoxide poisoning is also associated with most fires from smoke inhalation. </span></p>
<p><span>Currently, the only treatments for carbon monoxide poisoning are oxygen-based therapies, which help the body eliminate the toxic gas. However, even with treatment, nearly half of survivors suffer long-term heart and brain damage. This has created an urgent need for faster, more effective therapies.</span></p>
<p><span>In the new study, the research team developed a new engineered protein-based therapy called </span><strong>RcoM-HBD-CCC</strong><span>, which acts like a sponge to soak up carbon monoxide from the blood. Beginning with RcoM (short for “regulator of metabolism”)—a natural protein the bacterium </span><em><span>Paraburkholderia xenovorans </span></em><span>uses to sense minute levels of carbon monoxide—the researchers engineered a version that is highly selective: It grabs carbon monoxide without interfering with oxygen or other important molecules in the body.</span></p>
<p><span>In tests on mice, the new therapy worked quickly to remove carbon monoxide from red blood cells and was safely flushed out of the body through urine. “Unlike other protein-based treatments, we found the compound caused only minimal changes in blood pressure, which was an exciting finding and raised the potential for this new molecule to have clinical applications,” said study corresponding author </span><strong><a href="https://www.medschool.umaryland.edu/profiles/gladwin-mark/">Mark T. Gladwin, MD</a></strong><span>, Dean of UMSOM who is also the Vice President for Medical Affairs, University of Maryland, Baltimore (UMB), and the John Z. and Akiko K. Bowers Distinguished Professor. “This has the potential to become a rapid, intravenous antidote for carbon monoxide that could be given in the emergency department or even in the field by first-responders.”</span></p>

<h3>How Carbon Monoxide Kills</h3>
<p><span>In healthy bodies, oxygen inhaled from the air binds to the protein hemoglobin on the surface of red blood cells, which then ferry the oxygen to all the tissues of the body. Inhaled poisonous carbon monoxide gas, however, competes with oxygen for hemoglobin. It enters the bloodstream and binds to hemoglobin with a 200 to 400-fold greater affinity than oxygen. That means carbon monoxide hogs most of the hemoglobin seats, so not enough oxygen molecules can get a ride to the tissues that need them. </span></p>
<p>Currently, the only available treatments for carbon monoxide poisoning involve giving 100 percent pure oxygen, sometimes under pressure in a hyperbaric chamber.</p>
<p>All too often, patients are not transported, diagnosed, and treated in time to reverse the effects of carbon monoxide poisoning, which can cause lasting cardiac and neurological injuries or even death.</p>
<p>“This molecule could be a game-changer because it can directly and rapidly remove carbon monoxide from the body with such a low risk of off-target side effects,” said <span><a href="https://www.medschool.umaryland.edu/profiles/rose-jason/"><strong>Jason J. Rose, MD, MBA</strong></a></span>, Associate Professor of Medicine, Division Chief of Pulmonary, Critical Care &amp; Sleep Medicine, and one of the study’s researchers. “Given the promising results, we also see the potential for RcoM-HBD-CCC use in other areas, like as a blood substitute in severe anemia or hemorrhagic shock.”</p>
<h3>Bloodstream Scavengers</h3>
<p>The research team focused on engineering carbon monoxide “scavengers,” which are proteins structurally similar to hemoglobin, known as hemoproteins, but exhibiting even greater binding affinity — stickiness — for carbon monoxide, and less affinity for binding oxygen.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.medschool.umaryland.edu/media/som/news/2025/RcoM.jpg" alt="The natural protein RcoM">Infused in the bloodstream, scavenger hemoproteins like RcoM-HBD-CCC rapidly bind to carbon monoxide molecules, reducing the time it takes to clear half of the carbon monoxide in the blood to less than a minute, compared to more than hour with pure oxygen therapy and five hours without any treatment. When carbon monoxide is cleared, this frees hemoglobin on red blood cells to begin carrying oxygen once again.</p>
<p>But many hemoproteins also share some affinity for binding oxygen, and can therefore also scavenge nitric oxide, a molecule important in regulating blood pressure. Infusions of hemoproteins or hemoglobin can reduce the levels of nitric oxide in the blood, leading to tightened blood vessels and a rapid rise in blood pressure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this latest study, the researchers were surprised to find that RcoM-HBD-CCC did not result in an increase in blood pressure regardless of whether carbon monoxide was present in the blood. They theorize that while RcoM-HBD-CCC may scavenge nitric oxide, a blood-pressure regulating molecule, it may do so more slowly than other hemoproteins, leading to its safer profile.</p>
<p>Future studies will likely include more pre-clinical research to determine the safe and effective dosage range for RcoM-HBD-CCC in treating carbon monoxide poisoning. It could also form the basis for new research in other fields, including as an oxygen delivery therapy or blood substitute. This could include hemorrhagic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), severe anemias, and the preservation of organs for transplantation.</p>
<p><span>Dr. Rose and Dean Gladwin are co-founders and directors of Globin Solutions, which has licensed technology based on RcoM from the University of Pittsburgh towards the development of a CO poisoning antidote. Dr Rose is President and CEO of Globin Solutions. Globin Solutions has sponsored research agreements with UMB. </span></p>
