<p>Welcome to the <em>Physics-based Deep Learning Book</em> (v0.2) üëã</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>:
This document contains a practical and comprehensive introduction of everything
related to deep learning in the context of physical simulations.
As much as possible, all topics come with hands-on code examples in the
form of Jupyter notebooks to quickly get started.
Beyond standard <em>supervised</em> learning from data, we‚Äôll look at <em>physical loss</em> constraints,
more tightly coupled learning algorithms with <em>differentiable simulations</em>,
training algorithms tailored to physics problems,
as well as
reinforcement learning and uncertainty modeling.
We live in exciting times: these methods have a huge potential to fundamentally
change what computer simulations can achieve.</p>

<section id="coming-up">
<h2>Coming up<a href="#coming-up" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>As a <em>sneak preview</em>, the next chapters will show:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How to train networks to infer a fluid flow around shapes like airfoils, and estimate the uncertainty of the prediction. This gives a <em>surrogate model</em> that replaces a traditional numerical simulation.</p></li>
<li><p>How to use model equations as residuals to train networks that represent solutions, and how to improve upon these residual constraints by using <em>differentiable simulations</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>How to more tightly interact with a full simulator for <em>inverse problems</em>. E.g., we‚Äôll demonstrate how to circumvent the convergence problems of standard reinforcement learning techniques by leveraging simulators in the training loop.</p></li>
<li><p>We‚Äôll also discuss the importance of <em>inversion</em> for the update steps, and how higher-order information can be used to speed up convergence, and obtain more accurate neural networks.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Throughout this text,
we will introduce different approaches for introducing physical models
into deep learning, i.e., <em>physics-based deep learning</em> (PBDL) approaches.
These algorithmic variants will be introduced in order of increasing
tightness of the integration, and the pros and cons of the different approaches
will be discussed. It‚Äôs important to know in which scenarios each of the
different techniques is particularly useful.</p>
<div>
<p>Executable code, right here, right now</p>
<p>We focus on Jupyter notebooks, a key advantage of which is that all code examples
can be executed <em>on the spot</em>, from your browser. You can modify things and
immediately see what happens ‚Äì give it a try by
<a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/tum-pbs/pbdl-book/blob/main/intro-teaser.ipynb">[running this teaser example in your browser]</a>.</p>
<p>Plus, Jupyter notebooks are great because they‚Äôre a form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming">literate programming</a>.</p>

        <tr>
    <td>
        <p dir="auto">In this post we are reproducing GPT-2 in llm.c. This is <strong>"the GPT-2"</strong>, the full, 1558M parameter version that was introduced in OpenAI's blog post <a href="https://openai.com/index/better-language-models/" rel="nofollow">Better Language Models and their Implications</a> in February 14, 2019. llm.c does so directly in C/CUDA (total of ~5,000 lines of code), without the typical training stack that would involve the Python interpreter and a significantly more complex deep learning library like PyTorch/JAX, huggingface/transformers, or etc. In 2019, training GPT-2 was an involved project from an entire team and considered a big model run but, ~5 years later, due to improvements in compute (H100 GPUs), software (CUDA, cuBLAS, cuDNN, FlashAttention) and data (e.g. the FineWeb-Edu dataset), we can reproduce this model on a single 8XH100 node in 24 hours, and for $672, which is quite incredible. There are some caveats and asterisks involved though - llm.c is still not perfectly tuned, sufficiently stabilized (we still see loss spikes and bad activation ranges now and then), and our evals are not comprehensive (e.g. we do not carefully eval multilingual, code, math); A lot of this work is still ongoing.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Unicorns</strong>. The natural place to start is probably with unicorns. In the GPT-2 blog post, OpenAI prompted GPT-2 with this unicorn prompt. Let's see what our model thinks about English-speaking unicorns in the Andes mountains:</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Prompt</strong>: <em>In a shocking finding, scientist discovered a herd of unicorns living in a remote, previously unexplored valley, in the Andes Mountains. Even more surprising to the researchers was the fact that the unicorns spoke perfect English.</em><br>
<strong>Completion</strong>: <em>It may sound like a hoax, or just a dream of the mythical animals, but it appears this may be a real case of the unicorn language. The Andean area has an abundance of minerals and is also very rich in biodiversity. According to the researchers' study, the unicorns' language is called Elveseo. To produce it, the animal forms a consonant from the lips and makes a vowel sound with the teeth, then produces a consonant sound with the mouth and makes an 'ow' sound from its chest. "The question is, what caused this, and what does this tell us about intelligence and communication?" commented study co-author Paul Marek. Speaking in the video, the unicorns had the right way to speak, the animals were able to communicate and talk in perfect English.</em></p>
<p dir="auto">Fun! :) The model is fairly coherent and qualitatively somewhere around the level of GPT-2. You can find 20 samples from both GPT-2 and the llm.c model <a href="http://llmc.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/html/gpt2_vs_llmc30kedu.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>, or generate many more using instructions down below.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Training</strong>. Training a GPT-2 with llm.c is quite simple because it is written in C/CUDA, so there is no need for minconda, Python, PyTorch, etc. You will want an 8XH100 GPU box, I recommend spinning one up from <a href="https://lambdalabs.com/" rel="nofollow">Lambda labs</a>. But llm.c is flexible on its compute - if you have only 1 GPU you can still get your GPT-2, you'll just have to wait 8 days instead of 1. If you have 16 GPUs (e.g. using the new Lambda 1 Click Clusters), you'll be able to train multinode and only have to wait 12 hours. Once you spin up your node, here are the complete instructions to train your GPT-2 (this only takes a ~minute from blank box to start stepping):</p>

<p dir="auto">We can see that each step is about 2.75 seconds and there are 32,000 of them, so now we wait ~24 hours. At every step, this training run takes a chunk of ~1 million tokens of <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/HuggingFaceFW/fineweb-edu" rel="nofollow">FineWeb-EDU</a> (these are educational web pages from the internet), and updates the 1558 million weights of the model to be slightly better at predicting the next token in a sequence. By the end we'll have processed 32,000 * 1048576 = 33.6B tokens in total. The loss goes down as we do a better job predicting the next token. The norm will stabilize around 0.1-1, the learning rate is being warmed up over the first few steps. Our model flops utilization (MFU) is around 50%, i.e. quite efficient.</p>
<p dir="auto">Now wait 24 hours for this to finish, then you can visualize the <code>main.log</code> log file using the <a href="https://github.com/karpathy/llm.c/blob/master/dev/vislog.ipynb">dev/vislog.ipynb</a> jupyter notebook. For this you will need to also have Python and matplotlib installed, and you will see the following:</p>

<p dir="auto"><strong>Evals</strong>. On the left we are tracking the loss on FineWeb-EDU validation data. If you simply run the GPT-2 released by OpenAI and evaluate its loss on this split, you get the red horizontal line (loss 2.83). You see that our run outperforms this very very quickly, by step ~5,000. However, this is not a fair comparison because GPT-2 was trained on the never-released WebText dataset, so there is a possibly large distribution shift. So e.g. if you finetune the OpenAI model for 1,000 steps at LR 1e-4, the loss quickly plunges to the blue line (loss 2.61), because it's quickly adapting to the new data statistics. I like to look at the validation loss as a sanity check, but for the actual comparison we'd want to look at fixed, 3rd party evaluations. One of the well-behaved, smooth, common, often-cited evals that also offer early signal is the <a href="https://rowanzellers.com/hellaswag/" rel="nofollow">HellaSwag</a> eval. These are simple common sense scenarios and the model has to pick the correct continuation. We evaluate HellaSwag on the right pane, where we see that we cross over the GPT-2 model around step ~25K (earlier than GPT-2, which is estimated to have been trained on ~100B tokens. This possibly has to do with increased data quality, as we also observed in our earlier <a href="https://github.com/karpathy/llm.c/discussions/481" data-hovercard-type="discussion" data-hovercard-url="/karpathy/llm.c/discussions/481/hovercard">124M run</a>). The green line is the GPT-3 model of the same size, which is pretty much the same model architecture as GPT-2 with minor differences (context length 1024 -&gt; 2048) but trained for 300B tokens (i.e. ~10X more tokens than what we trained on here). I should say that even HellaSwag is not an ideal single point of comparison because it tests simple English and common sense, it does not test e.g. multilingual, math or code. It could have been that the WebText data mixture was a lot heavier on these, and these domains were "stealing" model capacity to some extent, we don't know because it was never released. Lastly, in general, good evals are harder at low model capability like GPT-2 because e.g. the models don't understand multiple choice, and their samples are not high enough quality to make above chance dent into standard math or code evals.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Args guide</strong>. Let's look at the args we passed into the training now in more detail. The GPT-2 release from OpenAI included model weights but very few details, while GPT-3 release had no weights but many details. So in many cases, we follow the GPT-3 paper hyperparameters because the GPT-2 paper has very very little information:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>-i -j</code> are training and validation splits token files, downloaded earlier with <code>edu_fineweb.sh</code></li>
<li><code>-o</code> is the output directory to write logs and checkpoints into</li>
<li><code>-v 250</code> asks to evaluate and log the validation loss every 250 steps</li>
<li><code>-s 300000</code> asks to sample some tokens every 300000 steps. Because the total number of steps will be less than this, this is hacky way to turn sampling off and we will only sample a single time at the very end.</li>
<li><code>-g 384</code> sets the number of tokens to be sampled at the end to be 384</li>
<li><code>-h 1</code> asks to evaluate the HellaSwag accuracy</li>
<li><code>-b 16</code> sets the micro-batch size to 16 . If you are running out of memory, decrease this value, e.g. try 8, 4, 2, all the way down to 1 potentially.</li>
<li><code>-t 1024</code> sets the maximum sequence length to 1024, as GPT-2 did</li>
<li><code>-d 1048576</code> asks that the total batch size be 2 to the power 20, following the GPT-3 paper hyperparameters table. The code will make sure to meet this desired total batch size and calculate the needed gradient accumulation "inner loop" steps of the optimization. For example up above, we saw that we have 8 GPUs each doing 16 X 1024 tokens, so that is 8 X 16 X 1024 = 131,072 tokens per micro-step (a single forward backward), so the code calculated gradient accumulation steps of 8 to meet the desired 1M batch size per step. i.e. it does forward+backward 8 times and then a single update.</li>
<li><code>-r 0</code> sets recompute to zero. Recompute is a way to trade off compute and memory. If <code>-r 1</code>, then we recompute a piece of the forward pass (the GeLU) during backward. This means we don't have to cache it and save memory, at the cost of some  more compute. So if you're running out of memory, try -r 1, or -r 2 (also recompute layernorms).</li>
<li><code>-z 1</code> turns on ZeRO-1 (i.e. optimizer state sharding) across multiple GPUs. If you're training with &gt; 1 GPU, this setting is a no-brainer and should basically always be on. On 1 GPU this setting is a no-op.</li>
<li><code>-c 0.1</code> sets the weight decay to 0.1. Only (2D) weights are decayed exactly as in GPT-2, and this number comes from the GPT-3 paper</li>
<li><code>-k "cosine"</code> sets the cosine learning rate schedule, which is the default so this is a bit spurious.</li>
<li><code>-l 0.0006</code> sets the maximum learning rate to 6e-4. The GPT-3 paper says to use 2e-4 for this model size, but here we triple and it and seems to train faster and without any issues. This wasn't tuned very carefully yet.</li>
<li><code>-q 0.1</code> says that we will decay the learning rate to 10% of max LR over the course of training, following GPT-3 paper.</li>
<li><code>-u 700</code> says that we will ramp up the learning rate from 0 to max learning rate over the first 700 iterations, which at total batch size 0.5M is 350M tokens, following GPT-3 paper.</li>
<li><code>-n 2000</code> asks to save model checkpoints every 2000 steps.</li>
<li><code>-x 32000</code> asks for 32K steps in total. I chose this number because it is a nice number, and just fits into 24 hours.</li>
<li><code>-ge 1</code> sets a very recently merged gelu recompute setting for CublasLt (optional)</li>
<li><code>-y 1</code> sets the "resume" flag on. If your training for any reason crashes or hangs, you can CTRL+C and re-run this command, and it will attempt to resume the optimization. llm.c is bitwise-deterministic, so you'll get the identical result as if you didn't crash.</li>
<li><code>-e "d48"</code> asks to initialize, a depth 48 GPT-2 model from scratch.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Memory guide.</strong> The biggest constraint most people will probably face is that their GPU doesn't have 80GB. That's okay you should still be able to run everything above if you are patient, it would just run slower. So if the model doesn't fit, what do you play with? The most important one is the micro batch size <code>-b</code>. Try to decrease it but keep it to nice numbers. So e.g. 16 -&gt; 8 -&gt; 4 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 1. From there, try to also play with the recompute setting <code>-r</code> which is 0 (fastest, a lot of memory), 1 (very slightly slower, but a huge memory saving), or 2 (slightly slower, smaller memory saving). The next thing you can do is disable master weights in fp32, which you can do with <code>-w 0</code> (1 is default). We won't maintain fp32 copy of params. Empirically in a few runs before this seems to be okay, likely due to our use of stochastic rounding. If even that doesn't fit (that's unlikely right?), you could try to decrease the maximum sequence length with <code>-t</code>, default is 1024 you can take it down to 512, 256, etc., but now you are making your model worse because you're decreasing its maximum attention span.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Code.</strong> Certainly I feel biased but llm.c is quite beautiful:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>It only requires basic CUDA dependencies to run.</li>
<li>It is a direct, minimal and readable implementation in C/CUDA. llm.c totals about 5,000 lines of C/CUDA code. We try to be mostly C, not C++ to keep it simple. Neural net training is just one while loop of the same, simple arithmetic operations (think +, -, *, /) on a single float array, it really shouldn't be that complicated.</li>
<li>It compiles and runs very quickly (few seconds), so you're doing more stepping and less waiting.</li>
<li>It allocates all of its GPU memory a single time at the start and from then on during training has an exactly constant memory footprint. So once you start stepping, you know you're good for the rest of the run and won't OOM.</li>
<li>It is bitwise deterministic.</li>
<li>It is efficient, at just below ~50% MFU.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">The main entry point and the majority of the code is in the file <a href="https://github.com/karpathy/llm.c/blob/master/train_gpt2.cu">train_gpt2.cu</a>. It contains the GPT-2 model definition and the training loop in ~2,000 LOC, and it imports a bunch of helper files with various utilities and the individual layer implementations from the <code>llmc</code> directory. <code>cloc llmc</code> reports 23 files with 3170 LOC, and <code>cloc train_gpt2.cu</code> is 1353 LOC atm.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Multi-node training</strong>. If you are part of the privileged GPU-rich upper class, llm.c supports multi-node training and the most GPUs I've seen someone train llm.c with is ~500 GPUs. This biggest run I've done personally so far is on Lambda's new 1-click cluster feature with 16XH100 GPUs in 2 nodes. The downsides of unemployment. The lambda team has put up <a href="https://github.com/LambdaLabsML/llm.c-1cc/tree/main">detailed instructions</a> on how you can train llm.c models on their 1-click clusters. E.g. with the 512-GPU H100 cluster for $2,300/hr, you might be able to train your GPT-2 in ~30 minutes. You'd have to increase the total batch size (e.g. to ~8M) and possibly tune the hyperparameters a little. I haven't tried but it probably works and would be very cool :)</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>PyTorch comparison</strong>. A relatively comparable run in PyTorch would I think look something like this, using our parallel PyTorch implementation:</p>

<p dir="auto">The PyTorch code is meant as a testing reference not an actual implementation, so the training loop is a little bit different in some places (e.g. the dataloader doesn't permute the shards, etc.), but this is still possibly useful as a point of reference. I also hacked the default vocab size to be 50257 -&gt; 50304 to get added efficiency, then the currently PyTorch nightly gives:</p>

<p dir="auto">Now I wouldn't say I have full confidence that the PyTorch script is maximally tuned, but the following observations can be made. PyTorch seems to be taking a lot more memory (this run is ~80GB), while llm.c is at 57GB (29% improvement). Memory is important because it allows you to crank up the batch size (e.g. llm.c can go up to 24 microbatch here), which goes a bit faster. Second, we're seeing about 3386 vs. 2750ms per iteration, so llm.c is stepping ~19% faster. Some of the gains here have known origin, e.g. llm.c includes optimizations like the Fused classifier that kicks off the backward pass, which is something torch.compile does not do today afaik. But it's also possible that this script isn't fully maximally tuned, but in any case I'm showing the comparison in case 1) others would like to take a look, play with, compare, help tune and 2) to just say that llm.c is quite optimized and fast - in the specific case of GPT-2/3 training.</p>

<p dir="auto">This model dramatically beats GPT-2 and GPT-3 of its size on HellaSwag (it gets up to ~61%), but sadly becomes unstable there on and explodes. There are more smaller spikes along the way but the code is configured to detect the more simple instantaneous instability and skips update (I used the flags <code>-sl 5.0 -sg 5.0</code>), which helps mitigate and defers issues. However, I think we're not yet being sufficiently careful with our initialization, activation ranges, and overall model training stability and there are deeper issues that gradually drift the model into instability, especially for larger models and over long training duration. To be continued. If you have ideas or recommendations for stabilizing LLM model training please contribute your experience in the discussion below.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>FAQ</strong>:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Can I <strong>sample</strong> from the model in llm.c? kind of, but it's inefficient and a bit weird, and even more hacky if you'd like to prompt the model. Use the huggingface paths above for now.</li>
<li>Can I <strong>chat</strong> with it? no, this is currently only pretraining, not chat finetuning.</li>
<li>Can you train in <strong>fp8</strong>? No, we're currently mostly training in bf16, but early versions are very much work in progress.</li>
<li>I have a non-NVIDIA GPU can I run llm.c? No, llm.c supports C/CUDA only, but good forks exist (see main README). For example there is an actively maintained <a href="https://github.com/anthonix/llm.c">AMD fork</a> by <a data-hovercard-type="user" data-hovercard-url="/users/anthonix/hovercard" data-octo-click="hovercard-link-click" data-octo-dimensions="link_type:self" href="https://github.com/anthonix">@anthonix</a> that is quite good.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><strong>GPT-2 (124M)</strong>. I wanted to also link to an earlier post on training the <a href="https://github.com/karpathy/llm.c/discussions/481" data-hovercard-type="discussion" data-hovercard-url="/karpathy/llm.c/discussions/481/hovercard">GPT-2 (124M) model</a> in llm.c, which has some more related information to llm.c runs. 124M is a smaller model in the GPT-2 miniseries, only 124M parameters compared to 1558M parameters.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Authors</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Substantial contributions to llm.c came from what now feels like the llm.c core dev team, in addition to self:</p>
<ul dir="auto">

If you're happily running llm.c on Windows you should definitely thank Ross :)</li>
<li><a href="https://lambdalabs.com/" rel="nofollow">Lambda labs</a> for sponsoring the GPUs used in the development of llm.c. The history here is that I've happily used Lambda for several years and then a few months ago I pretty please asked if they are open to not charging my account for llm.c dev work and they agreed so here we are thank you for supporting llm.c!</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Coming up</strong>. Some of the next big steps we are interested in and looking at these days:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Further optimize GPT-2 training hyperparameters. For some reason, the hyperparameters cited by OpenAI in the GPT-3 paper appear to be quite suboptimal, e.g. @Yuchenj_UW on X found that you can 3X the learning rate and get faster training with no apparent downsides. There might be other similar low-hanging fruit.</li>
<li>Improve training and scaling stability, e.g. more stable optimizers, schedulers, clipping, norming, muP. (Some of these PRs already exist, if you have tips on stabilizing LLM runs please reach out with ideas to try!).</li>
<li>Mixed precision++: training with fp8 (imminent!).</li>
<li>Model inference, e.g. KV cache is the low hanging fruit here.</li>
<li>Finetuning: SFT, RLHF</li>
<li>Multimodal extensions, VQVAE and friends</li>
<li>More modern architectures, support for Llama / Gemma model series.</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">The goal of llm.c remains to have a simple, minimal, clean training stack for a full-featured LLM agent, in direct C/CUDA, and companion educational materials to bring many people up to speed in this awesome field.</p>

            <p>Drug development is typically slow: The pipeline from basic research discoveries that provide the basis for a new drug to clinical trials and then production of a widely available medicine can take decades. But decades can feel impossibly far off to someone who currently has a fatal disease. Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard Senior Group Leader Sonia Vallabh is acutely aware of that race against time, because the topic of her research is a neurodegenerative and ultimately fatal disease ‚Äî fatal familial insomnia, a type of prion disease ‚Äî that she will almost certainly develop as she ages.&nbsp;</p><p>Vallabh and her husband, Eric Minikel, switched careers and became researchers after they learned that Vallabh carries a disease-causing version of the prion protein gene and that there is no effective therapy for fatal prion diseases. The two now run a lab at the Broad Institute, where they are working to develop drugs that can prevent and treat these diseases, and their deadline for success is not based on grant cycles or academic expectations but on the ticking time bomb in Vallabh‚Äôs genetic code.</p><p>That is why Vallabh was excited to discover, when she entered into a collaboration with Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research member Jonathan Weissman, that Weissman‚Äôs group likes to work at full throttle. In less than two years, Weissman, Vallabh, and their collaborators have developed a set of molecular tools called CHARMs that can turn off disease-causing genes such as the prion protein gene ‚Äî as well as, potentially, genes coding for many other proteins implicated in neurodegenerative and other diseases ‚Äî and they are refining those tools to be good candidates for use in human patients. Although the tools still have many hurdles to pass before the researchers will know if they work as therapeutics, the team is encouraged by the speed with which they have developed the technology thus far.</p><p>‚ÄúThe spirit of the collaboration since the beginning has been that there was no waiting on formality,‚Äù Vallabh says. ‚ÄúAs soon as we realized our mutual excitement to do this, everything was off to the races.‚Äù</p><p>Co-corresponding authors Weissman and Vallabh and co-first authors Edwin Neumann, a graduate student in Weissman‚Äôs lab, and Tessa Bertozzi, a postdoc in Weissman‚Äôs lab, describe CHARM ‚Äî which stands for Coupled Histone tail for Autoinhibition Release of Methyltransferase ‚Äî in a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.ado7082">paper</a> published today in the journal <em>Science</em>.</p><p>‚ÄúWith the Whitehead and Broad Institutes right next door to each other, I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any better place than this for a group of motivated people to move quickly and flexibly in the pursuit of academic science and medical technology,‚Äù says Weissman, who is also a professor of biology at MIT and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator. ‚ÄúCHARMs are an elegant solution to the problem of silencing disease genes, and they have the potential to have an important position in the future of genetic medicines.‚Äù</p><p><strong>To treat a genetic disease, target the gene</strong></p><p>Prion disease, which leads to swift neurodegeneration and death, is caused by the presence of misshapen versions of the prion protein. These cause a cascade effect in the brain: the faulty prion proteins deform other proteins, and together these proteins not only stop functioning properly but also form toxic aggregates that kill neurons. The most famous type of prion disease, known colloquially as mad cow disease, is infectious, but other forms of prion disease can occur spontaneously or be caused by faulty prion protein genes.</p><p>Most conventional drugs work by targeting a protein. CHARMs, however, work further upstream, turning off the gene that codes for the faulty protein so that the protein never gets made in the first place. CHARMs do this by epigenetic editing, in which a chemical tag gets added to DNA in order to turn off or silence a target gene. Unlike gene editing, epigenetic editing does not modify the underlying DNA ‚Äî the gene itself remains intact. However, like gene editing, epigenetic editing is stable, meaning that a gene switched off by CHARM should remain off. This would mean patients would only have to take CHARM once, as opposed to protein-targeting medications that must be taken regularly as the cells‚Äô protein levels replenish.</p><p>Research in animals suggests that the prion protein isn‚Äôt necessary in a healthy adult, and that in cases of disease, removing the protein improves or even eliminates disease symptoms. In a person who hasn‚Äôt yet developed symptoms, removing the protein should prevent disease altogether. In other words, epigenetic editing could be an effective approach for treating genetic diseases such as inherited prion diseases. The challenge is creating a new type of therapy.</p><p>Fortunately, the team had a good template for CHARM: a research tool called CRISPRoff that Weissman‚Äôs group previously developed for silencing genes. CRISPRoff uses building blocks from CRISPR gene editing technology, including the guide protein Cas9 that directs the tool to the target gene. CRISPRoff silences the targeted gene by adding methyl groups, chemical tags that prevent the gene from being transcribed, or read into RNA, and so from being expressed as protein. When the researchers tested CRISPRoff‚Äôs ability to silence the prion protein gene, they found that it was effective and stable.</p><p>Several of its properties, though, prevented CRISPRoff from being a good candidate for a therapy. The researchers‚Äô goal was to create a tool based on CRISPRoff that was just as potent but also safe for use in humans, small enough to deliver to the brain, and designed to minimize the risk of silencing the wrong genes or causing side effects.</p><p><strong>From research tool to drug candidate</strong></p><p>Led by Neumann and Bertozzi, the researchers began engineering and applying their new epigenome editor. The first problem that they had to tackle was size, because the editor needs to be small enough to be packaged and delivered to specific cells in the body. Delivering genes into the human brain is challenging; many clinical trials have used adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) as gene-delivery vehicles, but these are small and can only contain a small amount of genetic code. CRISPRoff is way too big; the code for Cas9 alone takes up most of the available space.</p><p>The Weissman lab researchers decided to replace Cas9 with a much smaller zinc finger protein (ZFP). Like Cas9, ZFPs can serve as guide proteins to direct the tool to a target site in DNA. ZFPs are also common in human cells, meaning they are less likely to trigger an immune response against themselves than the bacterial Cas9.</p><p>Next, the researchers had to design the part of the tool that would silence the prion protein gene. At first, they used part of a methyltransferase, a molecule that adds methyl groups to DNA, called DNMT3A. However, in the particular configuration needed for the tool, the molecule was toxic to the cell. The researchers focused on a different solution: Instead of delivering outside DNMT3A as part of the therapy, the tool is able to recruit the cell‚Äôs own DNMT3A to the prion protein gene. This freed up precious space inside of the AAV vector and prevented toxicity.</p><p>The researchers also needed to activate DNMT3A. In the cell, DNMT3A is usually inactive until it interacts with certain partner molecules. This default inactivity prevents accidental methylation of genes that need to remain turned on. Neumann came up with an ingenious way around this by combining sections of DNMT3A‚Äôs partner molecules and connecting these to ZFPs that bring them to the prion protein gene. When the cell‚Äôs DNMT3A comes across this combination of parts, it activates, silencing the gene.</p><p>‚ÄúFrom the perspectives of both toxicity and size, it made sense to recruit the machinery that the cell already has; it was a much simpler, more elegant solution,‚Äù Neumann says. ‚ÄúCells are already using methyltransferases all of the time, and we‚Äôre essentially just tricking them into turning off a gene that they would normally leave turned on.‚Äù</p><p>Testing in mice showed that ZFP-guided CHARMs could eliminate more than 80 percent of the prion protein in the brain, while previous research has shown that as little as 21 percent elimination can improve symptoms.</p><p>Once the researchers knew that they had a potent gene silencer, they turned to the problem of off-target effects. The genetic code for a CHARM that gets delivered to a cell will keep producing copies of the CHARM indefinitely. However, after the prion protein gene is switched off, there is no benefit to this, only more time for side effects to develop, so they tweaked the tool so that after it turns off the prion protein gene, it then turns itself off.</p><p>Meanwhile, a complementary project from Broad Institute scientist and collaborator Benjamin Deverman‚Äôs lab, focused on brain-wide gene delivery and <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adm8386">published</a> in <em>Science</em> on May 17, has brought the CHARM technology one step closer to being ready for clinical trials. Although naturally occurring types of AAV have been used for gene therapy in humans before, they do not enter the adult brain efficiently, making it impossible to treat a whole-brain disease like prion disease. Tackling the delivery problem, Deverman‚Äôs group has designed an AAV vector that can get into the brain more efficiently by leveraging a pathway that naturally shuttles iron into the brain. Engineered vectors like this one make a therapy like CHARM one step closer to reality.</p><p>Thanks to these creative solutions, the researchers now have a highly effective epigenetic editor that is small enough to deliver to the brain, and that appears in cell culture and animal testing to have low toxicity and limited off-target effects.</p><p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a privilege to be part of this; it‚Äôs pretty rare to go from basic research to therapeutic application in such a short amount of time,‚Äù Bertozzi says. ‚ÄúI think the key was forming a collaboration that took advantage of the Weissman lab‚Äôs tool-building experience, the Vallabh and Minikel lab‚Äôs deep knowledge of the disease, and the Deverman lab‚Äôs expertise in gene delivery.‚Äù</p><p><strong>Looking ahead</strong></p><p>With the major elements of the CHARM technology solved, the team is now fine-tuning their tool to make it more effective, safer, and easier to produce at scale, as will be necessary for clinical trials. They have already made the tool modular, so that its various pieces can be swapped out and future CHARMs won‚Äôt have to be programmed from scratch. CHARMs are also currently being tested as therapeutics in mice.&nbsp;</p><p>The path from basic research to clinical trials is a long and winding one, and the researchers know that CHARMs still have a way to go before they might become a viable medical option for people with prion diseases, including Vallabh, or other diseases with similar genetic components. However, with a strong therapy design and promising laboratory results in hand, the researchers have good reason to be hopeful. They continue to work at full throttle, intent on developing their technology so that it can save patients‚Äô lives not someday, but as soon as possible.</p>

                            <p><span>Those still holding on to their </span><a href="https://gizmodo.com/apple-vision-pro-1851249913"><span>Apple Vision Pros</span></a><span> may remain in a </span><a href="https://gizmodo.com/apple-vision-pro-already-forgotten-about-1851426564"><span>rather exclusive club</span></a><span> throughout this year. Market research shows that sales for Apple‚Äôs first big, expensive headset will remain low in 2024. The latest reports from those keeping tabs on the Cupertino, California company say AVP will have dropped off 75% by the end of August. The true test for Apple‚Äôs spatial dreams may rest on the rumored (slightly) </span><a href="https://gizmodo.com/apple-vision-pro-stopped-production-ar-headset-1851547035"><span>cheaper headset</span></a><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>The market analyst firm IDC told </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-11/apple-s-vision-pro-won-t-cross-500-000-sales-this-year-idc-says"><span>Bloomberg</span></a><span> the Apple Vision Pro has yet to sell 100,000 units. It‚Äôs an expensive headset, and Apple wasn‚Äôt expecting it to sell like an iPhone. Supply chain analysts have reported that <a href="https://gizmodo.com/apple-vision-pro-reality-check-1851429764">Apple cut its sales expectations for its $3,500 ‚Äúspatial computer‚Äù </a></span><span>in April. But this latest report shows that sales will have dropped off a cliff in the U.S. in the third quarter of this year and will continue to slacken through the holidays.</span></p> <p><span>Last month, Apple launched the Vision Pro in international markets, including Europe, the U.K., China, Japan, and Singapore. IDC expects the AVP‚Äôs interest in those markets to keep the headset‚Äôs sales afloat until next year. The real pick-me-up for Apple‚Äôs spatial dreams would be a new, less expensive headset. Those in the know have hinted Apple is working on a ‚Äúbudget‚Äù Vision device slated for the latter half of 2025.</span></p>

 <p><span>Even if the <a href="https://gizmodo.com/cheaper-weaker-apple-vision-pro-1851556515">next Vision device</a> costs half the Pro model, it will still cost $1,750 and one of the most expensive consumer-end VR/AR headsets you can buy. Rumors hint that the next device could remove the pointless exterior display to save on manufacturing costs. It could also reduce the FOV and use a less-capable chip than the current M2. Bloomberg hinted that Apple was even considering tethering it to an iPhone or Mac for daily use, which would drastically reduce its portability.</span></p> <p><span>We don‚Äôt have pure statistics on how many folks returned their Vision Pro after buying it during the initial hype rush, but analysts have noted that </span><a href="https://gizmodo.com/apple-vision-pro-returns-users-didnt-know-set-it-up-1851293527"><span>many who bought one were confused by</span></a><span> its more complicated setup and what they were supposed to use it for in their daily lives.</span></p>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Modules</h2><a id="user-content-modules" aria-label="Permalink: Modules" href="#modules"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The eCapture tool comprises 8 modules that respectively support plaintext capture for TLS/SSL encryption libraries like OpenSSL, GnuTLS, NSPR, BoringSSL, and GoTLS. Additionally, it facilitates software audits for Bash, MySQL, and PostgreSQL applications.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>bash		capture bash command</li>
<li>gnutls	capture gnutls text content without CA cert for gnutls libraries.</li>
<li>gotls		Capturing plaintext communication from Golang programs encrypted with TLS/HTTPS.</li>
<li>mysqld	capture sql queries from mysqld 5.6/5.7/8.0 .</li>
<li>nss		capture nss/nspr encrypted text content without CA cert for nss/nspr libraries.</li>
<li>postgres	capture sql queries from postgres 10+.</li>
<li>tls		use to capture tls/ssl text content without CA cert. (Support openssl 1.0.x/1.1.x/3.0.x or newer).
You can use <code>ecapture -h</code> to view the list of subcommands.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">OpenSSL Module</h2><a id="user-content-openssl-module" aria-label="Permalink: OpenSSL Module" href="#openssl-module"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The OpenSSL module supports three capture modes:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>pcap</code>/<code>pcapng</code> mode stores captured plaintext data in pcap-NG format.</li>
<li><code>keylog</code>/<code>key</code> mode saves the TLS handshake keys to a file.</li>
<li><code>text</code> mode directly captures plaintext data, either outputting to a specified file or printing to the command line.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Pcap Mode</h3><a id="user-content-pcap-mode" aria-label="Permalink: Pcap Mode" href="#pcap-mode"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">You can specify <code>-m pcap</code> or <code>-m pcapng</code> and use it in conjunction with <code>--pcapfile</code> and <code>-i</code> parameters. The default value for <code>--pcapfile</code> is <code>ecapture_openssl.pcapng</code>.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="./ecapture tls -m pcap -i eth0 --pcapfile=ecapture.pcapng tcp port 443"><pre>./ecapture tls -m pcap -i eth0 --pcapfile=ecapture.pcapng tcp port 443</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">This command saves captured plaintext data packets as a pcapng file, which can be viewed using <code>Wireshark</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Keylog Mode</h3><a id="user-content-keylog-mode" aria-label="Permalink: Keylog Mode" href="#keylog-mode"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">You can specify <code>-m keylog</code> or <code>-m key</code> and use it in conjunction with the <code>--keylogfile</code> parameter, which defaults to <code>ecapture_masterkey.log</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">The captured OpenSSL TLS <code>Master Secret</code> information is saved to <code>--keylogfile</code>. You can also enable <code>tcpdump</code> packet capture and then use <code>Wireshark</code> to open the file and set the <code>Master Secret</code> path to view plaintext data packets.</p>

This has contributed to a massive increase in LLM context length in the last two years, from 2-4K (GPT-3, OPT) to 128K (GPT-4), or even 1M (<a href="https://huggingface.co/gradientai/Llama-3-8B-Instruct-Gradient-1048k">Llama 3</a>). However, despite its success, FlashAttention has yet to take advantage of new capabilities in modern hardware, with FlashAttention-2 achieving only 35% utilization of theoretical max FLOPs on the H100 GPU. In this blogpost, we describe three main techniques to speed up attention on Hopper GPUs: exploiting asynchrony of the Tensor Cores and TMA to (1) overlap overall computation and data movement via warp-specialization and (2) interleave block-wise matmul and softmax operations, and (3) incoherent processing that leverages hardware support for FP8 low-precision.</p><p>We‚Äôre excited to release FlashAttention-3 that incorporates these techniques. It‚Äôs 1.5-2.0x faster than FlashAttention-2 with FP16, up to 740 TFLOPS, i.e., 75% utilization of H100 theoretical max FLOPS. With FP8, FlashAttention-3 reaches close to 1.2 PFLOPS, with 2.6x smaller error than baseline FP8 attention.</p><p>The improvements from FlashAttention-3 will result in:</p><ol role="list"><li><strong>More efficient GPU Utilization</strong>: The new technique uses up to 75% of an H100 GPU's maximum capabilities, up from just 35% before. This results in significantly (1.5-2x) faster than previous versions for training and running of large language models (LLMs).</li></ol><ol start="2" role="list"><li><strong>Better performance with lower precision</strong>: FlashAttention-3 can work with lower precision numbers (FP8) while maintaining accuracy. This allows for even faster processing and potentially lower memory usage, which could lead to cost savings and improved efficiency for customers running large-scale AI operations.</li></ol><ol start="3" role="list"><li><strong>Ability to use longer context in LLMs</strong>: By speeding up the attention mechanism, FlashAttention-3 enables AI models to work with much longer pieces of text more efficiently. This could allow for applications that can understand and generate longer, more complex content without slowing down.</li></ol><p>FlashAttention-3 is available on Github <a href="https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention">here.</a></p><p>Read the paper <a href="https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention">here</a>.</p><h2>FlashAttention Recap</h2><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14135">FlashAttention</a> is an algorithm that reorders the attention computation and leverages tiling and recomputation to significantly speed it up and reduce memory usage from quadratic to linear in sequence length. We use tiling to load blocks of inputs from HBM (GPU memory) to SRAM (fast cache), perform attention with respect to that block, and update the output in HBM. By not writing the large intermediate attention matrices to HBM, we reduce the amount of memory reads/writes, which brings 2-4x wallclock time speedup.</p><p>‚Äç</p><p>Here we show a diagram of FlashAttention forward pass: with tiling and softmax rescaling, we operate by blocks and avoid having to read/write from HBM, while obtaining the correct output with no approximation.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/650c3b59079d92475f37b68f/668fef78677cfc76424fd0f4_flash_recap_diagram.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h2>New hardware features on Hopper GPUs - WGMMA, TMA, FP8</h2><p>While FlashAttention-2 can achieve up to 70% theoretical max FLOPS on Ampere (A100) GPUs, it does not yet take advantage of new features on Hopper GPUs to maximize performance. We describe some of the new Hopper-specific features here, and why they are important.</p><p>1. WGMMA (Warpgroup Matrix Multiply-Accumulate). This new feature makes use of the new Tensor Cores on Hopper, with much higher throughput <sub>1</sub> than the older mma.sync instruction in Ampere (image from the <a href="https://resources.nvidia.com/en-us-tensor-core/gtc22-whitepaper-hopper?ncid=no-ncid">H100 white paper)</a>.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/650c3b59079d92475f37b68f/668fef94896a312df22db9bd_h100_wgmma.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>2. TMA (Tensor Memory Accelerator). This is a special hardware unit that accelerates the transfer of data between global memory and shared memory, taking care of all index calculation and out-of-bound predication. This frees up registers, which is a valuable</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/650c3b59079d92475f37b68f/668ff020c21b55bf4f71c935_h100_tma.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>3. Low-precision with FP8. This doubles the Tensor Core throughput (e.g. 989 TFLOPS with FP16 and 1978 TFLOPS with FP8), but trades off accuracy by using fewer bits to represent floating point numbers.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/650c3b59079d92475f37b68f/668ff09c0c34e79f0eb28842_h100_wgmma_fp8.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><div><p>FlashAttention-3 makes use of all of these new features of Hopper, using powerful abstractions from <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/cutlass">NVIDIA‚Äôs CUTLASS</a> library.</p><p>By rewriting FlashAttention to use these new features, we can already significantly speed it up (e.g., from 350 TFLOPS in FlashAttention-2 FP16 forward pass to around 540-570 TFLOPS). However, the asynchronous nature of the new instructions on Hopper (WGMMA and TMA) opens up additional algorithmic opportunities to overlap operations and thereby extract even greater performance. For this blogpost, we‚Äôll explain two such techniques specific to attention. The generic technique of warp specialization, with separate producer and consumer warps doing TMA and WGMMA, is <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/cutlass/blob/main/media/docs/efficient_gemm.md#warp-specialization">well-covered elsewhere</a> in the context of GEMM and works the same here.</p></div><h2>Asynchrony: Overlapping GEMM and Softmax</h2><p>Why overlap?</p><p>Attention has GEMMs (those matmuls between Q and K and between attention probability P and V) and softmax as its two main operations. Why do we need to overlap them? Isn‚Äôt most of the FLOPS in the GEMMs anyway? As long as the GEMMs are fast (e.g., computed using WGMMA instructions), shouldn‚Äôt the <a href="https://horace.io/brrr_intro.html">GPU be going <em>brrrr</em></a>?</p><p>The problem is that non-matmul operations are much slower than matmul operations on modern accelerators. Special functions such as exponential (for the softmax) have even lower throughput than floating point multiply-add; they are evaluated by the multi-function unit, a unit separate from floating point multiply-add or matrix multiply-add. As an example, the H100 GPU SXM5 has 989 TFLOPS of FP16 matrix multiply, but only 3.9 TFLOPS (256x less throughput) for special functions <sub>2</sub> ! For head dimension 128, there are 512x more matmul FLOPS than exponential, which means that exponential can take 50% of the time compared to matmul. The situation is even worse for FP8, where the matmul FLOPS are twice as fast yet exponential FLOPS stay the same speed. Ideally we want matmul and softmax to operate in parallel. While the Tensor Cores are busy with matmul, the multi-function units should be calculating exponential!</p><h3>Inter-warpgroup overlapping with pingpong scheduling</h3><p>The first and easiest way to overlap GEMM and softmax is to do nothing at all! The warp schedulers already try to schedule warps so that if some warps are blocked (e.g., waiting for GEMM results), other warps can run. That is, the warp schedulers do some of this overlapping for us, for free.</p><p>However, we can improve on this by doing some of the scheduling manually. As an example, if we have 2 warpgroups (labeled 1 and 2 ‚Äì each warpgroup is a group of 4 warps), we can use synchronization barriers (bar.sync) so that warpgroup 1 first does its GEMMs (e.g., GEMM1 of one iteration and GEMM0 of the next iteration), and then warpgroup 2 does its GEMMs while warpgroup 1 does its softmax, and so on. This ‚Äúpingpong‚Äù schedule is illustrated in the figure below, where the same color denotes the same iteration.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/650c3b59079d92475f37b68f/668ff0a001e73d009d1b73fb_pingpong_pipelining.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>This would allow us to perform the softmax in the shadow of the GEMMs of the other warpgroup. Of course, this figure is just a caricature; in practice the scheduling is not really this clean. Nevertheless, pingpong scheduling can improve FP16 attention forward pass from around 570 TFLOPS to 620 TFLOPS (head dim 128, seqlen 8K).</p><h3>Intra-warpgroup overlapping of GEMM and Softmax</h3><p>Even within one warpgroup, we can have some part of softmax running while the GEMMs of that warpgroup is running. This is illustrated in this figure, where the same color denotes the same iteration.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/650c3b59079d92475f37b68f/668ff0d6d9fd917e68abc5f3_2_stage_pipelining.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>This pipelining increases throughput from around 620 TFLOPS to around 640-660 TFLOPS for FP16 attention forward, at the cost of higher register pressure. We need more registers to hold both accumulators of the GEMMs, and the input/output of softmax. Overall, we find this technique to offer a favorable tradeoff.</p><p>Low-precision: reduce quantization error with incoherent processing</p><p>LLM activation can have <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07339">outliers</a> with much larger magnitude than the rest of the features. These outliers make it difficult to quantize, producing much larger quantization errors. We leverage incoherent processing, a technique used in the quantization literature (e.g. from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13304">QuIP</a>) that multiplies the query and key with a random orthogonal matrix to ‚Äúspread out‚Äù the outliers and reduce quantization error. In particular, we use the Hadamard transform (with random signs), which can be done per attention head in O(d log d) instead of O(d^2) time, where d is the head dimension. Since the Hadamard transform is memory-bandwidth bound, it can be fused with previous operations such as rotary embedding (also memory-bandwidth bound) ‚Äúfor free‚Äù.</p><p>In our experiment where Q, K, V are generated from a standard normal distribution but 0.1% of the entries have large magnitudes (to simulate outliers), we found that incoherent processing can reduce the quantization error by 2.6x. We show numerical error comparison in the table below. Please see the paper for details.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/650c3b59079d92475f37b68f/668ff0e415c3198e0afba4ab_flash3_numerical_error.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h2>Attention benchmark</h2><p>We show some results with FlashAttention-3, and compare it to FlashAttention-2, as well as the implementation in Triton and cuDNN (both of which already use new hardware features of Hopper GPUs).</p><p>For FP16, we see about 1.6x-1.8x speedup over FlashAttention-2</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/650c3b59079d92475f37b68f/668ff11d2cb1c308a71d0cdf_flash3_fp16_fwd.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/650c3b59079d92475f37b68f/668ff0f215c3198e0afbad52_flash3_fp16_bwd.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>For FP8, we can reach close to 1.2 PFLOPS!</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/650c3b59079d92475f37b68f/668ff0e74da9fa32dfc5bacf_flash3_fp8_fwd.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h2>Discussion</h2><p>This blogpost highlights some of the optimizations for FlashAttention available on Hopper GPUs. Other optimizations (e.g., variable length sequences, persistent kernel, and in-kernel transpose for FP8) are covered in the paper. <br>We have seen that designing algorithms that take advantage of the hardware they run on can bring significant efficiency gains and unlock new model capabilities such as long context.

  <p>The "Rulers of the Ancient World" is a metrology/design/production project, based around producing a range of period correct rulers from various ancient empires.</p><p>Stemming from a personal fascination with the creation and development of systems of measurement, this project seeks to highlight the artfulness of handmade tools and the capability of handwork and CNC milling to complement one another and create a unique, novel product.</p><p>The original series of four rulers (Egyptian Span &amp; Cubit, Roman Cubitus and Japanese Kanejaku)&nbsp;are each locally sourced Hard Maple, hand planed, French polished and waxed, and etched by CNC with a 0.1 mm engraving bit, which is then inked with India Ink, applied by hand. The Limited Edition ruler set, an Egyptian Span, Roman Cubitus and Japanese Shaku, were made with local and historically accurate woods for their respective cultures, and created by similar means. The French "Roubo" Fathom was made with flamed maple, and similarly polished and finished, though etched by hand. Lastly, like the Limited Edition ruler set, the French "Roubo Pied du Roi" ruler is made of European Sycamore, a geographically correct and culturally relevant wood.</p><p>The goals of this project are far-reaching- to illuminate the use of these ancient measurement systems, to enable a physical, tactile engagement with a piece of history, and highlight the possibility of beauty and novelty in toolmaking in the presence of traditional techniques and CNC machinery.</p>

  <p>The French "Roubo" Fathom is based on the pre-metric, 18th century "Pied du Roi," or the King's foot. This foot varies from the modern foot a significant amount, about 51/64" over a foot.

  <p>The "Roubo Pied du Roi"&nbsp;ruler is based on the 18th Century French foot.&nbsp;This foot varies from the modern imperial foot a significant amount, about 51/64" over a foot. This makes each inch/thumb (<em>pouce)</em>&nbsp;1.066" and each foot (<em>pied</em>)&nbsp;12.792". The inch is divided into 12 lines (<em>lignes</em>), an interested subdivision used by the French for its divisibility. This adds an interesting feature to this ruler- one edge's subdivisions emphasize 1/6 and 1/3 subdivisions, while the other emphasizes 1/8, 1/4 and 1/2 subdivisions.</p><p>This era in measurement in Europe was one of great variety and decentralization- at one time, dozens of different measures could be found, based on occupation and locale.

While certain countries were better at maintaining a consistent measure, it was exactly this issue that eventually led to the establishment and eventual adoption of the metric system- though I have to say, there is a romantic (if ridiculous) impulse to support this diversity of unit on my part- though adoption of common units of measure have undoubtedly led to an ease in collaboration and documentation of all matter of work.

  <h2>Egyptian "Cubit" and "Span" Rulers</h2>
</p>






















</div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_7_1455661458912_11097">
  <p>The Egyptian Cubit Ruler and its half size Span ruler are based on various "Cubit Rods" found in the tombs of famous foremen and architects of Ancient Egypt. These rods, given as ornamental gifts by Pharoahs to nobility, serve as references for modern archaeological and metrological experts in determining the dimensions of measures from this time. This particular ruler is based on those cubit rods found in the Turin Museum, in Turin, Italy, and its dimensions go back to roughly 1500 BC, during the "New Kingdom" era of Egypt.&nbsp;</p><p>My initial excitement for metrology came from reading "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Secrets-Great-Pyramid-Discoveries-Surrounding/dp/0883659573">Secrets of the Great Pyramid,</a>"&nbsp;a book by metrologist and egyptologist Peter Tompkins. In this book, Tompkins uses projections of the base units of measure in the civilization who built the pyramids to make determinations as to the geometrical basis of the pyramids, and goes on to use these conclusions to further extrapolate possible uses and design elements of the pyramids. This interest was further heightened when in 2010 I was able to visit the Great Pyramid and spend time, alone with only my father and two sisters, in the Queen's Chamber, the heart of the pyramid.&nbsp;</p><p>The two ruler's units are based on the Egyptian "Djeba" or finger, measuring 18.75 mm (0.738"). Each is further subdivided into a "Sheshep" or palm of four fingers, "Drt" or hand of five fingers,&nbsp;the "Pedj-aa" or large span of 14 fingers, which is the Span ruler's full length of 10.332". The larger cubit ruler extends to the "Meh Niswt" or Royal Cubit, which is two spans of 14 fingers, or 20.664". An interesting quirk of these rulers concern the first fourteen fingers, each of which is divided into their respective subdivision, for example the seventh finger is divided in seven, the tenth into ten, so on. This is copied directly from the ancient cubit rod relics, and speaks to both their use and possession of divider-like tools, and their use of fractional, complex mathematics.</p><p>There is a lot of interesting reading concerning these units, the cubit rods, and metrology in general, and were my sources for the research that led to these rulers. Here are a few links:</p><p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.metmuseum.org/pubs/bulletins/1/pdf/3257092.pdf.bannered.pdf">A small article from the Metropolitan Museum of Art on Cubit Rods</a>.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.egyptorigins.org/index.html">Egypt Origins</a>, an HTML-ey website full of technical and detailed accounts of Egyptian units, cubit rods, and other such information.</p><p>"<a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Secrets-Great-Pyramid-Discoveries-Surrounding/dp/0883659573">Secrets of the Great Pyramid</a>" by Peter Tompkins on Amazon.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/museums-static/digitalegypt/">Digital Egyptian Museum</a>, another old school HTML website full of good information on the Ancient Egyptian Civilizations.</p>

  <h2>Japanese "KaneJaku" Shaku Ruler</h2>
</p>






















</div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_7_1455661458912_62825">
  <p>The Japanese "Kanejaku" or Shaku Ruler is based on the Japanese unit of the "Shaku," an ancient measure derived from the Chinese "Chi," adopted in Japan in 701, though the units used here are based on those in use during Japan's Edo period, from the 17th to 19th centuries.&nbsp;Its original length was likely much shorter than the standardized 303 mm, as it was originally the length from outstretched thumb to middle finger. Several stories attempt to explain the change, my favorite of which tells about its use in taxation, and its elongation due to corrupt officials attempting to lengthen the unit and therefore increase their take.</p><p>The unit standardized in 1891 was based on the "Kanejaku" or carpenter's square measure, as it had seemingly changed the least over time, in part due to its use in temple building. As this is a tool made for (and by) woodworkers, I was inclined to name it after this original unit. The unit was standardized to 10/33 meters, or around 11.93", though its proximity to the foot is happenstance.&nbsp;<span>While the base unit is the "Shaku" of 303 mm (~11.93"), there are further decimal subdivisions. The ÂØ∏&nbsp;or "Sun" is 1/10 of a shaku (~1.19"), and the </span><span>ÂàÜ&nbsp;</span><span>decimal or "Bu" is 1/100 of a shaku (~0.119").</span></p><p>An interesting aspect of this ruler from a design standpoint was the question of how to represent the numbers and characters of the Japanese language. With the other rulers, I used the characters that were common at the time of the measurement's use, and do not use any modern characters or anachronistic type or language. However in this case, the unit was adopted in Japan in 701 CE, but changed so much over that time that the only reasonable measurement on which to base it was its 1891 standardized length. So, I opted to use the modern numbering scheme, opting out of using more formal Japanese number system or more primitive. As the unit is still in use today among temple builders and other traditional Japanese makers, this is in part a salute to the relevance and steadfastness of the unit itself. I also took the time to design and redraw my own Japanese characters, both for the numbers and the characters for the Bu, Sun and Shaku.</p><p>An interesting etymological note- the Shakuhachi instrument of Japan takes its name from its length- one shaku and "hachi" (eight) sun, their combination in a etymological blending being shaku-hachi. Just a fun note.</p><p>On another note, there is another "Shaku" unit, called the "Kujirajaku" or Whale Shaku. It is used in the textile industry, much like the yard in the United States. It gets its name from the baleen of a whale, which were used as measurement tools themselves. This ruler is around 379 mm (14.9") inches long, and a great example of using a natural resource with a relatively consistent length as a measurement tool. I'd make a ruler in this size, but its nature as a flexible ruler for cloth would be lost being made of wood, and I'm certainly not interested in acquiring any baleen!

  <h2>Roman "Cubitus" Ruler</h2>
</p>






















</div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_7_1455661458912_218416">
  <p>The Roman "Cubitus" Ruler is based on the measure used in Ancient Rome roughly around the time of the Second Triumvariate period, circa 40 BCE. The base unit of the Romans was in fact the "Pes" or foot (296 mm or 11.65"), though they used the cubit as well, measured at 1 1/2 "Pes," or about 444 mm (17.47")&nbsp;. The subdivisions of the foot may be this ruler's most interesting feature- the foot is divided into both 12 "Uncia" or thumbs (etymological root of inch) and 16 "Digiti" or digits. This comes from a duality of systems- the Greek divided their foot into 16 "Daktylos" or fingers, but this older system gave way slowly over the course of the Empire's reign to the "Uncia," a division of twelve. Interestingly, these units coexisted for some time, with different regions using the different subdivisions.</p><p>My inclusion of this ruler and system of measurement in this project is two-fold. For one, this is one of the most widespread measurements of all time, maybe the most widely used before the British foot and Metric system traveled the world. On the other hand, it is very similar to many other measurements around that time, and represents what many coexistent civilizations were using, including the Egyptian and Byzantine Empires of the first few centuries CE. It also is the distant source of the modern English foot, being very similar at 11.65" (though not as close as the Shaku at 11.93", which is simply a coincidence). Furthermore, there is some controversy as to whether the "Pes" refers to an anatomical foot or a shoed or booted foot, and account for the general truth that one's foot is shorter than an actual foot.</p><p>Aside from the "Cubitus" and "Pes," this ruler also features the "Palmus" or width across the palm, and "Palmus Major" or length of the hand from heel of the palm to tip of the middle finger. I wish I could feature some of the longer length measurements, as they get colorful in longer lengths- a step of 2 1/2 feet, a pace 5 feet, a perch of 10 feet, and the famous stadium of 625 feet. I'll have to make some really long rulers to attain these measurements. Maybe some day.</p><p>There is a huge body of research on this subject. Metrologists have studied the Roman foot for centuries, and it's relation to the English foot is a widely discussed topic. This research goes as far back as 1647, when John Greaves, an antiquary, astronomer and mathematician, wrote the snappily named "<a target="_blank" href="https://books.google.com/books?id=LW86AAAAcAAJ">A discourse of the Romane foot and denarius; from whence, as from two principles, the measures and weights used by the ancients may be deduced</a>" in which he writes at some length attempting to determine the true measurement of the Roman foot, by way of measuring various statues and buildings (which,&nbsp;thanks to the magic of the internet, you can read in full at the link above). Others later picked up the research and posited their own conjectured measurements, notably Sir William Smith, a lexicographer who compiled a number of researched sources for his "Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography, Mythology and Geography."</p><p>There is a wealth of information on the subject, here a few links I found interesting or useful:</p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://books.google.com/books?id=LW86AAAAcAAJ">John Greave's book on the Roman Foot</a>&nbsp;written in 1647, also discusses the denarius, the Roman currency coin.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Frontinus/De_Aquis/text*.html">English Translation of a primary source </a>on the use of digiti and uncia, written by Frontinus in the 1st century CE.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.unrv.com/culture/distance-measurements.php">UNRV website page on the length measurements</a>, which is brief but the site as a whole is a great resource for Roman history.</p>

  <h2>Vedic Aratni Ruler</h2>
</p>






















</div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_3_1500678874958_61700">
  <div><p>Derived from my research into the units used in early Indus Valley civilizations, this ruler's system of measurement comes from unearthed relics from Mohenjo Daro, coupled with research spanning from the indigenous Nepalese systems to Vedic texts like the Arthashastra. This system's base unit, the "Angula," or finger,&nbsp;dates back to around 2500 BCE, making it one of the oldest systems of measurement known. The Angula I've chosen to use is 16.764 mm, a measure deciphered from an unearthed scale etched on a shell, found on the Mohenjo Daro archaeological site in 1930 by Ernest Mackay.</p><p>This ruler is unique, in a few ways. First, it is about half as wide as the standard maple rules- this is largely because it has no subdivisions below the finger (Angula) and could therefore be made smaller- though it is long, at 15.847". The numerals are new, as well, being Devanagari Sanskrit numerals, as would have been used in the time of the measurements. It also has two new "corporeal" units- the "Bow Grip," or Dharnugrah, of four fingers, and the "Fist + Thumb," or Dhanurmishti, of eight fingers.</p></div><p>The ruler is Maine-grown, quarter sawn Hard Maple, with a hand rubbed French polish finish with a hard wax coating, hand rubbed india ink etching and hand planed surfaces. Each ruler is slightly individual, though precisely dimensioned. There will be slight variants in grain and etch depth do to its hand made nature.</p>

  <h2>Limited Edition Ruler Set</h2>
</p>






















</div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_3_1466106089330_100972">
  <p>This set of three rulers, in an edition of only ten,&nbsp;is the culmination of research into the native timbers, measurement systems and traditions of three ancient cultures- Dynastic Japan, Pharaonic Egypt and Ancient Rome.</p><p>The first is a Roman Cubitus rule, made in quarter-sawn European Sycamore (<em>Acer pseudoplatanus)</em>, a wood famous in ancient Rome, mentioned and revered by many of the famous Roman historians. &nbsp;It depicts several of the main units of Ancient Rome, the Hand, Span, Foot and Cubit, measured in both Digiti (1/16th of a Roman Foot) and Uncias (1/12th of a Roman Foot), both of which were used at various points of the Roman Empire. This is the longest ruler of the set, and the thinnest, allowing for some flexibility, as the wood is a very strong and sturdy timber.</p><p>The next is a Japanese Shaku made in Japanese Cedar (<em>Cryptomeria japonica</em>) also called sugi (<em>Êùâ)</em>&nbsp;by the Japanese. This wood is planted ornamentally around many of the temples of Japan, and is appropriate for this ruler, as the "Shaku" unit was the base unit of building the temples and shrines of Dynastic Japan.&nbsp;The Japanese "Kanejaku" or Shaku Ruler is based on the Japanese unit of the "Shaku," an ancient measure derived from the Chinese "Chi," adopted in Japan in 701, though the units used here are based on those in use during Japan's Edo period, from the 17th to 19th centuries.</p><p>The last of the set is the Egyptian "Span" ruler in African Blackwood (<em>Dalbergia melanoxylon),&nbsp;</em>called hbny by the Ancient Egyptians (which happens to be the <a target="_blank" href="https://dianabuja.wordpress.com/2012/10/02/modern-words-that-survive-from-ancient-egypt-what-how-and-why/">etymological root of the word ebony</a>). This was a wood of great value in Ancient Egypt, used in ornamental goods and furniture, often for the pharaoh himself.&nbsp;The Egyptian "Span" ruler is based on various "Cubit Rods" found in the tombs of famous foremen and architects of Ancient Egypt. This particular ruler is based on those cubit rods found in the Turin Museum, in Turin, Italy, and its dimensions go back to roughly 1500 BC, during the "New Kingdom" era of Egypt.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="auto">While Korvus provides a high-level interface in multiple programming languages, its core operations are built on optimized SQL queries. This approach offers several advantages:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Transparency</strong>: Advanced users can inspect and understand the underlying queries.</li>
<li><strong>Customizability</strong>: Extend Korvus's capabilities by modifying or adding to its SQL operations.</li>
<li><strong>Performance</strong>: Benefit from PostgreSQL's advanced query optimization capabilities.</li>

  <p>If you are of a certain vintage, this image is burned indelibly somewhere
in your posterior parietal complex:</p>
<p><img src="https://matttproud.com/blog/x-window-system-boot-stipple/root_weave_640x480.png" alt="640 x 480 of ‚Äúroot_weave‚Äù"></p>
<p>Oh, my old friend.  How it‚Äôs been a long time.</p>
<h2 id="cultural-significance">Cultural Significance</h2>
<p>For the uninitiated, what are we looking at?  Could it be the <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Moir%C3%A9_error">Moir√© Error</a> from
Doom? Well, no. You are looking at (part of) the boot up screen for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System">X
Window System</a>, specifically the pattern it uses as the background of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_window">root
window</a>.  This pattern is technically called a <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/stipple">stipple</a>.</p>
<p>What you‚Äôre seeing is pretty important and came to symbolize a lot for me as a
computer practitioner.  Over time, I came to develop a relationship with it
roughly as this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[‚Ä¶] if you gaze for long into a stipple, the stipple gazes also into you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What would compel me to say that?</p>
<p>Well, part of it is nostalgia, but the other part is practical.  For a long time
the X Window System had a reputation for being difficult to configure.  In
retrospect, I‚Äôm not 100% sure why it earned this reputation, because the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XF86Config">configuration file format</a>, which is plain text, has remained essentially the
same since I started using Linux in the mid-1990s.  On the other hand, the
amount of hand-written input required for the configuration file has fallen
gradually over time.  This is where the critique lies: the amount of information
that needed to be gathered.  In the old days, it used to be that mouse,
keyboard, video card, monitor, fonts, plugin+module data, etc. needed to be
spelled out in detail in <code>/etc/X11/XF86Config</code>.  If you were starting out with a
bare configuration file (e.g., after a fresh install of a system), researching
the necessary parameters for your hardware could be a real pain in the ass.  In
this era, I had dial-up Internet, and Google wasn‚Äôt a thing yet.</p>
<p>And this leads to to an interesting observation: <strong>you wouldn‚Äôt want to wing it
with the configuration</strong>, because allegedly <a href="https://superuser.com/questions/126523/can-one-really-fry-a-monitor-by-setting-the-wrong-horizsync-and-vertrefresh">you could break your monitor with a
bad <code>Monitor</code> setting</a>.  That never happened to me or my friends, or at least
none of my friends ever fessed up to it happening to them.  What I will fess up
to is giving my monitor a bad case of electrical whine on a few occasions.  Here
is an example <code>Monitor</code> setting found in an <code>XF86Config</code> file from Red Hat 5.0
(1997‚Äì8) vintage) to give you an idea of just the level of detail required for
the monitor:</p>

</div><p>Did your blood pressure raise looking at that?  Mine did.  Remember: this
information wasn‚Äôt a casual Google Search away for many of us back then.</p>
<p>So what does this have to do with the stipple I mentioned earlier?  Combine the
onerousness of configuration above with the fact that computers weren‚Äôt
particularly fast, and the answer will become clear.  I recall in the era that
the X Window System took on the order of ‚Äî what felt like ‚Äî tens of seconds to
start even for relatively simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_window_manager">window managers</a> like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twm">twm</a>.  <em>We were using
spinning disks, after all!</em>  So it could take a while to get the X Window System
properly configured through trial and error. Misconfiguration could mean any of
the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>(allegedly) frying your hardware</li>
<li>suboptimal display (e.g., bad resolution, missing fonts) operation</li>
<li>misconfigured peripheral (e.g., no mouse)</li>
<li>misconfigured user space windowing environment (e.g., no window manager, or
it is broken)</li>
</ul>
<p>As I have gotten older, I became acutely aware that one of the most important
things that matters for technical learning and productive use is a tight
edit-run cycle<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>; and that‚Äôs where the stipple comes in.  That stipple above
is <strong>the first thing</strong> that the X Window System would display on startup if
things were going reasonably well with the X Server and its configuration. So
seeing that meant you knew the things were at least partially (if not most of
the way) working. And that was because it could take multiple seconds longer for
the window manager to follow with its startup.  Heaven forbid you were starting
a full-blown desktop environment in this era.</p>
<p>Was this the stipple‚Äôs actual purpose?  I‚Äôm frankly uncertain.  I‚Äôd hoped that
someone would have written about this already, but nobody really has ‚Äî at least
that I could find.  The best I found is a whimsical <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130322160540/http://www.openbsd.org/faq/faq11.html">historical excerpt from the
OpenBSD FAQ</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We test as above, and‚Ä¶ SUCCESS! We have what appears to be a very nice, high
resolution display. Note that ALL that is expected is a mesh pattern (very
good for seeing how good your monitor REALLY is and also great for calibrating
LCD displays, called the ‚Äúroot weave‚Äù) and a movable cursor. It is not
intended to be functional at this point.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nevertheless, given OpenBSD‚Äôs reputation of being a methodical project, I‚Äôm
inclined to give the FAQ authors some credence.  The early smoke testing success
signal combined with implicit branding seem like as good of a guess as any.</p>
<h2 id="today">Fast Forward to Today</h2>
<p>So why write about something that seems purely like an indulgence?  Surely the
stipple still lives with us today and requires no further discussion?  Well, up
until the early-2010s (at least on the Linux distributions I was using), this
boot up scene was common to see ‚Äî <strong>until it suddenly wasn‚Äôt</strong>.</p>
<p>Linux distributions had a reputation for not being particularly bleeding edge
with the packages they contained.  So to my surprise one day this startup
behavior just stopped.  I took note of it, but I never researched why (life
comes at you fast, and I was distracted by more important things: moving abroad,
starting a family, starting a new job, etc).</p>
<p>So why did the stipple go away?  I‚Äôm not terribly certain to be honest (there
was no central bug tracker<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>), but I‚Äôll posit some guesses based on the
contextual history:</p>
<p>There was a desire in the mid-2000s to 2010s to improve the boot speed of Linux
and its overall accessibility to newcomers.  <a href="https://canonical.com/">Canonical</a> was sinking a lot of cash
into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu">Ubuntu</a> as well as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mir_(software)">Mir</a>. This was also happening in the backdrop of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemd">systemd</a>‚Äôs development.  In short, there was concerted momentum to modernize
the ecosystem.</p>
<p>According to my detective work, in September 2008, a commit lands
(<a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xorg/xserver/-/commit/0bb317a78b96fddcdac319c9706b3a12f931ea44">0bb317a78b96fddcdac319c9706b3a12f931ea44</a>) in the <a href="https://www.x.org/wiki/">X.Org</a> server that adds a
flag to the X Server called <code>-retro</code> that backs a global variable called
<code>party_like_its_1989</code>. This commit removes the default stipple and the customary
<a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xorg/font/xfree86-type1/-/blob/e2a0089fc5b6404a6ab417ec6b1b75645283358f/cursor.pfa"><code>X_cursor</code></a> behaviors from boot, which look like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://matttproud.com/blog/x-window-system-boot-stipple/xfree86-startup.png" alt="X Window System starting up"></p>
<p>Looking at this, the global variable‚Äôs name alone tells us the sentiment: out
with the old; in with the new.  I‚Äôm just surprised it took several years for the
new default behavior to land in whatever distribution I was using at the time,
which is why I made the remark above about distributions not having been super
bleeding edge.  Why did it take until the mid-2010s for me to notice the
disappearance?</p>
<p>Thinking aloud, the flag‚Äôs help description of <code>"start with classic stipple and cursor"</code> doesn‚Äôt really do a good service to the reader.  Let me give you a
concrete formulation of what I mean: <strong>have you ever encountered the word
‚Äústipple‚Äù before reading this, and did you already know what the word means?</strong> I
don‚Äôt want to be unkind to the maintainers, but I think this flag‚Äôs description
is probably lost on a majority of readers (probably intentionally so).</p>
<h3 id="getting-it-back">Getting our Stipple Back</h3>
<p>All of this talk about the stipple‚Äôs evoking a desire to bring it back.  So how
do we do that in modern software?  Do you still use <a href="https://www.x.org/releases/X11R7.6/doc/man/man1/startx.1.xhtml"><code>startx</code></a> to start your X
Server?  I‚Äôm guessing not; but if you did, it‚Äôs as easy as:</p>
<div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span>1
</span></code></pre></td>
<td>
<pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="shell"><span><span>startx -- -retro  <span># note the preceeding -- to provide options to the X Server</span>
</span></span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div><p>To make that permanent with <code>startx</code>, you could amend your <code>~/.xserverrc</code> file
to include the <code>-retro</code> flag:</p>
<div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span>1
</span><span>2
</span><span>3
</span><span>4
</span><span>5

</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span>exec</span> /usr/bin/X -nolisten tcp<span>" "</span><span>${</span><span>@</span><span>}</span><span>"  # add -retro before the -nolisten
</span></span></span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div><p>And of course a similar workflow as the above can be applied to all users on
the system if you amend the <code>/etc/X11/xinit/xserverrc</code> file.</p>
<p>If you are using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME_Display_Manager">GNOME Display Manager</a> (GDM), you
appear to be out of luck with due to the <a href="https://github.com/GNOME/gdm/blob/main/daemon/gdm-x-session.c"><code>/usr/libexec/gdm-x-session</code></a> shim not
providing a mechanism to pass through arbitrary options to the X Server.</p>
<p>Users of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XDM_(display_manager)">X Display Manager</a> (XDM) can amend <code>/etc/X11/xdm/Xservers</code> file to
include the <code>-retro</code> argument √† la:</p>
<div>

</div><p>Users of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LightDM">LightDM</a> can amend the <code>/etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf</code> file such that it

<pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="text"><span><span>[Seat:*]
</span></span><span><span>xserver-command = /usr/lib/xorg/Xorg -retro
</span></span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div><p>I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs a way to do this with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Desktop_Display_Manager">SDDM</a>, but it won‚Äôt install on my machine
due to a networking problem.</p>
<p>Failing that, you can always use <a href="https://www.x.org/releases/X11R7.6/doc/man/man1/xsetroot.1.xhtml"><code>xsetroot</code></a> to just replace your root window‚Äôs
background.</p>
<p>But ‚Äî wow ‚Äî isn‚Äôt that a fuck-ugly fractal of fragmentation?  I mean, I get on a
technical level why each thing that is managing the X Server takes a different
approach (independent development by individual engineers with different design
philosophies and requirements), but this just a stupid amount of toil to pass a
measly flag. I guess it‚Äôs a shame that X.Org went the flag route and didn‚Äôt
expose a mechanism in the X Server‚Äôs configuration file.</p>
<h2 id="definition">Definition of the Stipple</h2>
<p>So how is the stipple defined?  Is it defined as a file (asset) for the X Server
to load at runtime? This part sent me on a goose chase.  I did not discover
commit <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xorg/xserver/-/commit/0bb317a78b96fddcdac319c9706b3a12f931ea44">0bb317a78b96fddcdac319c9706b3a12f931ea44</a> until relatively late in my
research, and it would have simplified my research into this question.</p>
<p>Herein lies some fun duality; the stipple is defined <strong>both</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>statically in the X Window System source code in device-independent X
(<a href="https://www.x.org/wiki/Development/Documentation/XserverSourceLayout/">dix</a>)‚Äôs (<a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xorg/xserver/-/blob/72036261738c10d718cb42696289ae85b7f6f703/dix/window.c#L542-550"><code>window.c</code></a>) as an inline value literal and</li>
<li>as a standalone <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_BitMap">X BitMap</a> file called <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xorg/data/bitmaps/-/blob/master/root_weave?ref_type=heads"><code>root_weave</code></a> that gets installed as a
file in <code>/usr/include/X11/bitmaps/root_weave</code></li>
</ul>
<p>For startup, however, the X Window System only uses the static source code
definition (the data backing the <code>_back_lsb</code> or <code>_back_msb</code> variables from dix‚Äôs
<code>window.c</code> based on your machine‚Äôs <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness">endianness</a>).</p>
<p>Behold, the stipple has a real name: <strong>root weave</strong>!</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The definition of the root weave bitmap data literal and that of the
file appear to be different.</p>
<h2 id="history">History of the Root Weave</h2>
<p>Now, if you clicked the link for <code>root_weave</code> above, you probably noticed an
interesting detail: this file was last changed approximately 20 years ago.  So
it‚Äôs old, right?  Well, this is where things get most interesting in my opinion.</p>
<p>Not that long ago, <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2024/07/x-window-system-at-40.html">we celebrated the X Window System‚Äôs 40th birthday</a>!  And
this led to me wonder: could we determine the introduction of root weave?</p>
<p>I worked backwards:</p>
<ul>
<li>I skipped checking the X.Org sources, because I knew root weave existed long
before, and I remember the X.Org and XFree86 schism relatively well.</li>
<li>OK.  Now on to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XFree86">XFree86</a>.  Well, here‚Äôs the initial<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> commit from <code>Wed Apr 27 07:07:10 1994 +0000</code> (approximately 30 years ago) introducing it, so evidently
we didn‚Äôt go far enough back:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/ajax/xfree86/-/blob/03432c3ccba2746d2fb95a636a87fe732bede83c/programs/Xserver/dix/window.c#L83-84">https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/ajax/xfree86/-/blob/03432c3ccba2746d2fb95a636a87fe732bede83c/programs/Xserver/dix/window.c#L83-84</a></li>
<li><a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/ajax/xfree86/-/blob/fa85847d3586bfdd5abd4d495668d9b47ff56545/include/bitmaps/root_weave">https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/ajax/xfree86/-/blob/fa85847d3586bfdd5abd4d495668d9b47ff56545/include/bitmaps/root_weave</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>So what predates XFree86?  Was XFree86 derived or forked from something else?
Can we find anything in source released from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Athena">Project Athena</a>?  Luckily X.Org
has a <a href="https://www.x.org/releases/">historical release archive</a>.  I trawled through the predecessors of
X11, and sure enough all of them have both the static source definition and
the bitmap!  The earliest release they had was X10R3, which according to
Wikipedia dates to February 1986.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, I think we can conclude that root weave hails from somewhere between June
1984 (X1) and February 1986.</p>
<h2 id="bitmap-ecosystem">An Ecosystem of X BitMap Files</h2>
<p>It turns out that root weave is not the only X BitMap file that comes installed,
and there are a bunch of other ones that are about as old as it.  We
have some other weaves:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>cross weave: kind of meh</p>
<p><img src="https://matttproud.com/blog/x-window-system-boot-stipple/cross_weave_640x480.png" alt="640 x 480 of ‚Äúcross_weave‚Äù"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>wide weave: I like it</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>And there are plenty of others bitmaps (some newer).  I made a quick <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_print">contact

<p>I‚Äôm certain there is some fun and weird history with these images.  Is there
anyone around who can recount it, though?  The one that caught my eye was
‚Äúwoman‚Äù.  OK, why is there one called ‚Äúwoman,‚Äù and why is it so aesthetically
different from the rest?  By coincidence, in my research I came across the
<a href="https://www.x.org/wiki/X11R1/">release notes for X11R1</a>; it hints that ‚Äúwoman‚Äù was used to demonstrate a
regression in the server‚Äôs code:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With the ‚Äúwoman‚Äù bitmap, the small images are corrupt on color screens (server

<p>Curious.</p>
<h2 id="detours">Other Detours</h2>
<p>Seminal software often inspires and influences other software.  Sometimes these
others are derivative products.  A good analogue for this are derivative game
engines and the tree they form (e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quake_engine#Derivative_engines">Quake I derivatives</a>).  This exercise
prompted a whole bunch of fundamental history questions around software
provenance and lineage to which I didn‚Äôt have the answer:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What was XFree86 based on?  Was it a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_room_design">clean room implementation</a> or a
derivative?  I simply didn‚Äôt know.  It turns out XFree86 is derived from the
original Project Athena.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What about other X Window System servers, particularly commercial ones?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>For instance, what about the X Server for Solaris?  Solaris 9 (I have no
ability to check earlier releases) also includes the same weave X BitMap
files.  As best as I can tell, its native X Server (<code>Xsun</code>) is a derivative
of Project Athena.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And one of the first Linux installations I ever used came with a commercial
X Server made by the now-defunct company <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030731165914/http://metrolink.com/">Metro Link</a>, which offered a
low-touch server called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030812132431/http://www.metrolink.com/products/metrox/index.html">Metro-X</a>.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>  I managed to find an ISO
of Red Hat 5.0 with Metro-X, so I booted it up.  Nearly same story with it
including these weaves, too.  This server looks to be more closely related
to XFree86, though.</p>
<p>What was fascinating about Metro-X was that it was legitimately easy to
configure in this era of non-trivial setup (even for newbies).  I remember
that fondly.  It had somewhat modern ‚Äî by today‚Äôs standards ‚Äî X Server
device probing functionality that just worked.</p>
<p>Here are some screenshots from the Metro-X setup wizard (it looks like it
is built on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motif_(software)">Motif</a>, which would have been customary for the era, based
on the symbols in the <code>configX</code> binary):</p>
<p><img src="https://matttproud.com/blog/x-window-system-boot-stipple/metro-x-splash.png" alt="Metro-X Splash"></p>

<p><img src="https://matttproud.com/blog/x-window-system-boot-stipple/metro-x-card.png" alt="Metro-X Card Settings"></p>
<p>Again, all of this was automatically probed correctly, which is nuts
considering this is Linux in 1997 (Linux Kernel 2.0.32).</p>
<p>1998-era XFree86 came with a graphical configurator, but I don‚Äôt recall it
having any autoprobing capability; it merely managed the configuration file.
Let‚Äôs contrast Metro-X‚Äôs <code>configX</code> with XFree86‚Äôs <code>XF86Setup</code>, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Athena_Widgets">X Athena
Widgets</a> and TCL-based tool that appears to be short-lived (removed in
2003):</p>

<p>Regrettably Metro Link appears to have folded in October 2003, so the rest
will be in the annals of history.</p>

<h2 id="revisiting">Revisiting the Era with Fresh Eyes</h2>
<p>Playing around with several old versions of Linux and adjacent ecosystem
software provided an opportunity to see if the good ol‚Äô days were in fact any
good.  Well, to be honest, this was some rough software to work with.  A lot of
creature comforts that I am used to are not there (e.g., no <code>-r</code> flag for
<code>grep</code>), and the overall user experience is extremely unpolished.  If we take a
step back from configuring the X Servers of that era and look at how the servers
are bootstrapped in terms of how <code>startx</code> and friends are implemented, wow, it
is a lot more complicated (e.g., <code>serverargs</code> and <code>clientargs</code> machinations that
look well intentioned but also incredibly fragile).</p>
<p>To counterbalance that, I have to say in spite of some improvements in the
intervening years, Linux and X seem like an accretion disk. Not enough acquired
complexity was shed.</p>
<p>I will remark that in spite of my job being a software engineer, I had never
spent a lot of time looking at the source code for the X Server (XFree86 or
X.Org) before.  It‚Äôs really nuts to see that a lot of the architecture from
X10R3 and X11R1 still persists in the code today, which is a statement that can
be said in deep admiration for legacy code but also disturbance from the power
of old decisions. Without having looked at the internals of any Wayland
implementation, I can sympathize sight unseen with the sentiments that some
developers have toward the X Window System: the code is a dead end.  I say that
with the utmost respect to the X Window System as a technology and an ecosystem.
I‚Äôll keep using X, and I will be really sad when it‚Äôs no longer possible for me
to do so for one reason or another, as I‚Äôm extremely attached to it quirks.  But
it‚Äôs clear the future is limited.</p>
<h2 id="other-futures">Our Lost Futures</h2>
<p>We could have ended up with a different default stipple. The images above with
cross and wide weave hinted at that.</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs what it would have looked like with some of the other fun contenders from
the included bitmaps:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>tie_fighter</p>
<p><img src="https://matttproud.com/blog/x-window-system-boot-stipple/tie_fighter_640x480.png" alt="640 x 480 of ‚Äútie_fighter‚Äù"></p>
<p>Lucasfilm, Ltd. would not have approved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>xlogo16</p>
<p><img src="https://matttproud.com/blog/x-window-system-boot-stipple/xlogo16_640x480.png" alt="640 x 480 of ‚Äúxlogo16‚Äù"></p>
<p>Maybe a wet dream a certain of Space Karen.  I personally like the X (as in X
Window System) logo when it stands on its own, and I wish it wasn‚Äôt now
tainted with the connotations of this booger.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I‚Äôd like to imagine that there was a timeline where X had
stronger branding.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And taking things in a more absurd direction, let‚Äôs consider <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_3.1">Windows 3.1</a> with
respect to the stipples above.  Windows 3.1 had a very strong design language
in my mind ‚Äî as did Windows NT up to and including Windows 2000.  It also turns
out that Windows 3.1 (maybe even Windows 3.0 if memory serves) had a
bitmap-style background pattern feature that included a pattern composition
tool.  So I took a stab at making the weaves in the editor:</p>
<p><img src="https://matttproud.com/blog/x-window-system-boot-stipple/win31-composer.png" alt="Windows 3.1 Pattern Composer"></p>
<p>Interesting, what would have Windows 3.1 have looked like with these weave
patterns?  Let‚Äôs find out!</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>root weave</p>
<p><img src="https://matttproud.com/blog/x-window-system-boot-stipple/win31-root-weave.png" alt="Windows 3.1 Root Weave"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>cross weave</p>
<p><img src="https://matttproud.com/blog/x-window-system-boot-stipple/win31-cross-weave.png" alt="Windows 3.1 Cross Weave"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>wide weave</p>
<p><img src="https://matttproud.com/blog/x-window-system-boot-stipple/win31-wide-weave.png" alt="Windows 3.1 Wide Weave"></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All of this leads me to wonder what would Edward Tufte have said about the
original X ecosystem and its aesthetics.  A lot of it was spartan and clear, yet
there is some gratuitous <a href="https://books.google.ch/books/about/Visual_Design_of_the_User_Interface.html">administrative debris</a> here and there (like this
stipple).</p>
<h2 id="closing-words">Closing Words</h2>
<p>Diving deep into this gave me a lot of joy ‚Äî&nbsp;and a great chance to revisit the
past. In case of errors, omissions, or other cool details, get in contact with
me.</p>
<p>So knowing now that root weave and all of that is from 1986, should I send X.Org
a pull request to rename the <code>party_like_its_1989</code> global variable to
<code>party_like_its_1986</code> or <code>party_like_the_1980s</code>.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>.  Something tells me
they wouldn‚Äôt welcome it.</p>

Our goal was ambitious: to create a new breed of full-text search engine that is ten times more cost-efficient than Elasticsearch, significantly easier to configure and manage, and capable of scaling to petabytes of data <sup id="fnref-1-609909"><a href="#fn-1-609909">1</a></sup>.</p><p>While we knew the potential of Quickwit, our tests typically did not exceed 100 TB of data and 1 GB/s of indexing throughput. We lacked the real-world datasets and computing resources to test Quickwit at a multi-petabyte scale.</p><p>That is, until six months ago, when two engineers at Binance, the world's leading cryptocurrency exchange, discovered Quickwit and began experimenting with it. Within a few months, they achieved what we had only dreamed of: they successfully migrated multiple petabyte-scale Elasticsearch clusters to Quickwit, with remarkable achievements including:</p><ul><li>Scaling indexing to <strong>1.6 PB per day</strong>.</li><li>Operating a search cluster handling <strong>100 PB of logs</strong>.</li><li><strong>Saving millions of dollars</strong> annually by <strong>slashing compute costs by 80%</strong> and storage costs by 20x (for the same retention period).</li></ul><div><div><table><tbody><tr><th>Dataset</th><th></th></tr><tr><td>Uncompressed Size</td><td>100 PB</td></tr><tr><td>Size on S3 (compressed)</td><td>20 PB</td></tr><tr><td>Num documents</td><td>181 trillions</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div><table><tbody><tr><th>Indexing deployment</th><th></th></tr><tr><td>Indexing throughput</td><td>1.6 PB / day</td></tr><tr><td>Num pods</td><td>700</td></tr><tr><td>Num vCPUs</td><td><span>4000</span><span> 2800*</span></td></tr><tr><td>RAM</td><td><span>6</span><span> 5.6*</span> TB</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><div><div><table><tbody><tr><th>Search deployment</th><th></th></tr><tr><td>Searchable dataset size</td><td>100 PB</td></tr><tr><td>Num pods</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td>Num vCPUs</td><td>1200</td></tr><tr><td>RAM</td><td>3 TB</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div><table><tbody><tr><th>Infra costs vs. Elasticsearch</th><th></th></tr><tr><td>Compute costs</td><td>5x reduction</td></tr><tr><td>Storage costs <br><small>for same retention</small></td><td>20x reduction</td></tr><tr></tr></tbody></table></div></div><small>*First figures initially published were wrong :/</small><p>In this blog post, I will share with you how Binance built a petabyte-scale log service and overcame the challenges of scaling Quickwit to multi-petabytes.</p><p>As the world's leading cryptocurrency exchange, Binance handles an enormous volume of transactions, each generating logs that are crucial for security, compliance, and operational insights. This results in processing roughly 21 million log lines per second, equivalent to 18.5 GB/s, or 1.6 PB per day.</p><p>To manage such a volume, Binance previously relied on 20 Elasticsearch clusters. Around 600 Vector pods were pulling logs from different Kafka topics and processing them before pushing them into Elasticsearch.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Binance ES setup" src="https://quickwit.io/assets/images/2024-06-20-binance-setup-kafka-vector-es-bc7ee32a83e8aae14aa3ec088d918244.png" width="1889" height="856"></p><p>However, this setup fell short of Binance's requirements in several critical areas:</p><ul><li><strong>Operational Complexity</strong>: Managing numerous Elasticsearch clusters was becoming increasingly challenging and time-consuming.</li><li><strong>Limited Retention</strong>: Binance was retaining most logs for only a few days. Their goal was to extend this to months, requiring the storage and management of 100 PB of logs, which was prohibitively expensive and complex with their Elasticsearch setup.</li><li><strong>Limited Reliability</strong>: Elasticsearch clusters with high ingestion throughput were configured without replication to limit infrastructure costs, compromising durability and availability.</li></ul><p>The team knew they needed a radical change to meet their growing needs for log management, retention, and analysis.</p><p>When Binance's engineers discovered Quickwit, they quickly realized it offered several key advantages over their existing setup:</p><ul><li><strong>Native Kafka integration</strong>: It allows ingesting logs directly from Kafka with exactly-once semantics, providing huge operational benefits. Concretely speaking, you can tear down your cluster, recreate it in a minute without losing any data, ready to ingest at 1.6 PB/day or search through petabytes, and scale up and down to handle temporary spikes.</li><li><strong>Built-in VRL transformations</strong> (Vector Remap Language): As Quickwit supports VRL, it eliminates the need for hundreds of Vector pods to handle log transformations.</li><li><strong>Object storage as the primary storage</strong>: All indexed data remains on object storage, removing the need for provisioning and managing storage on the cluster side.</li><li><strong>Better data compression</strong>: Quickwit typically achieves 2x better compression than Elasticsearch, further reducing the storage footprint of indexes.</li></ul><p>However, no users had scaled Quickwit to multi-petabytes, and any engineer knows that scaling a system by a factor of 10 or 100 can reveal unexpected issues. This did not stop them, and they were ready to take on the challenge!</p><center><img loading="lazy" src="https://quickwit.io/img/blog/2024-06-20-challenge-accepted.jpg" alt="Searching 100 PB, Challenge accepted" width="400"></center><p>Binance rapidly scaled its indexing thanks to the Kafka datasource. One month into their Quickwit PoC, they were indexing at several GB/s.</p><p>This quick progress was largely due to how Quickwit works with Kafka: Quickwit uses Kafka's consumer groups to distribute the workload across multiple pods. Each pod indexes a subset of the Kafka partitions and updates the metastore with the latest offsets, ensuring exactly-once semantics. This setup makes Quickwit's indexers stateless: you can tear down your entire cluster and restart it, and the indexers will resume from where they left off as if nothing happened.</p><p>However, Binance's scale revealed two main issues:</p><ul><li><strong>Cluster Stability Issues</strong>: A few months ago, Quickwit‚Äôs gossip protocol (called <a href="https://github.com/quickwit-oss/chitchat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chitchat</a>) struggled with hundreds of pods: some indexers would leave the cluster and rejoin, making the indexing throughput unstable.</li><li><strong>Uneven Workload Distribution</strong>: Binance uses several Quickwit indexes for their logs, with varying indexing throughputs. Some have a high throughput of several GB/s, others just a few MB/s. Quickwit's placement algorithm does not spread its workload evenly. This is a known <a href="https://github.com/quickwit-oss/quickwit/issues/4630" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">issue</a>, and we will work on this later this year.</li></ul><p>To work around these limitations, Binance deployed separate indexing clusters for each high-throughput topic, keeping one cluster for smaller topics. Isolating each high-throughput cluster did not impose an operational burden thanks to stateless indexers. Additionally, all Vector pods were removed as Binance used Vector transformation directly in Quickwit.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Binance Quickwit setup" src="https://quickwit.io/assets/images/2024-06-20-binance-setup-kafka-quickwit-5326a36908ce42113ac90fccaf3799e6.png" width="2110" height="1183"></p><p>After several months of migration and optimization, Binance finally achieved an indexing throughput of 1.6 PB with 10 Quickwit indexing clusters, 700 pods requesting around 2800 vCPU and 6 TB of memory, that's 6.6 MB/s per vCPU on average. On a given high-throughput Kafka topic, this figure goes up to 11 MB/s per vCPU.</p><p>Next challenge to come: scaling search!</p><p>With Quickwit now capable of efficiently indexing 1.6 PB daily, the challenge shifted to searching through petabytes of logs. With 10 clusters, Binance would normally need to deploy searcher pods for each cluster, undermining one of Quickwit‚Äôs strengths: pooling searcher resources to hit the object storage shared by all indexes.</p><p>To avoid this pitfall, Binance's engineers devised a clever workaround: they created a unified metastore by replicating all metadata from each indexing cluster metastore into one PostgreSQL database. This unified metastore enables the deployment of one unique centralized search cluster capable of searching through all indexes!</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Quickwit multi clusters setup" src="https://quickwit.io/assets/images/2024-06-20-quickwit-multi-indexers-clusters-setup-f83edb0ef91fcc35680e31469c451eb1.png" width="1966" height="1098"></p><p>As we speak, Binance now manages a reasonably sized cluster of 30 searcher pods, each requesting 40 vCPU and 100GB memory. To give you an idea, you only need 5 searchers (8 vCPU, 6GB memory requests) to find the needle in the haystack in 400 TB of logs. Binance runs those types of queries on petabytes but also aggregation queries, hence the higher resource requests.</p><p>Overall, Binance's migration to Quickwit was a huge success and brought several substantial benefits:</p><ul><li>80% reduction in computing resources compared to Elasticsearch.</li><li>Storage costs reduced by a factor of 20 for the same retention period.</li><li>Economically viable solution for large-scale log management, both in terms of infrastructure costs and maintenance operations.</li><li>Minimal configuration tweaking, working efficiently once the right number of pods and resources were determined.</li><li>Increased log retention to one or several months, depending on the log type, improving internal troubleshooting capabilities.</li></ul><p>In conclusion, Binance‚Äôs migration from Elasticsearch to Quickwit has been an exciting 6-month experience between Binance and Quickwit engineers, and we are very proud of this collaboration. We have already planned improvements in data compression, multi-cluster support, and better workload spread with Kafka datasources.</p><p>Huge kudos to Binance's engineers for their work and insights throughout this migration &lt;3</p></main></div></div>]]></description>

<p>About a week ago, my home Internet (AT&amp;T Fiber) went from the ~1 Gbps I pay for down to about 100 Mbps (<a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2021/monitor-your-internet-raspberry-pi">see how I monitor my home Internet with a Pi</a>). It wasn't too inconvenient, and I considered waiting it out to see if the speed recovered at some point, because latency was fine.</p>

<p>But as you can see around 7/7 on that graph, the 100 Mbps went down to about <em>eight</em>, and that's the point where my wife starts noticing how slow the Internet is. Action level.</p>

<p>So I fired up AT&amp;T's support chat. I'm a programmer, I can usually find ways around the wily ways of chatbots.</p>

<p>Except AT&amp;T's AI-powered chatbot seems to have a fiendish tendency to equate 'WiFi' with 'Internet', no doubt due to so many people thinking they are one and the same.</p>

<p><img width="500" height="auto" src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/att-chatbot-slow-internet-not-wifi.png" alt="ATT Chatbot - Slow Internet not WiFi"></p>

<p>We were stuck in that loop for about 5 minutes.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It looks like you're having trouble with your WiFi.</p>
  
  <p><em>No.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>After working a few different angles, I finally 'spammed 0'<sup id="fnref:olddays"><a href="#fn:olddays" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> by entering some variation of 'connect me to a support rep'.</p>

<p><img width="300" height="auto" src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/att-chatbot-connect-to-support-rep.png" alt="ATT Chatbot - connect me to support rep"></p>

<p>I'll cut to the chase‚Äîafter repeating some variation of that about 8 times, eventually I got queued up in the 20 minute line to a human support rep.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for me, the human support rep, like so many in the industry, promptly ignored the data I provided in my first chat message to him<sup id="fnref:message"><a href="#fn:message" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, and told me switching WiFi channels on the device (on which WiFi is currently disabled completely) would solve my issue. <em>At no cost.</em></p>

<p><img width="300" height="auto" src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/att-chat-support-wifi.png" alt="ATT Support Rep - WiFi is not the problem"></p>

<p>Maybe I should welcome our AI overlords?</p>

It‚Äôs even true for parents of younger kids, ages 7-9 because every parent sees it coming and few know what to do about it. Parents don‚Äôt want their children to disappear into phones, as so many of their friends' children have; some resolve to </span><a href="https://www.waituntil8th.org/" rel="">wait until 8th grade</a><span>, or later.

Their main research project has been the </span><a href="https://sapienlabs.org/global-mind-project/" rel="">Global Mind Project</a><span>, an ongoing program that tracks mental well-being around the world using a comprehensive assessment of mental health along with questions about demographics and various cultural, technological, and lifestyle factors. They have issued a </span><a href="https://sapienlabs.org/research-and-reports/" rel="">variety of reports on the state of mental health around the world</a><span>. Among their most important findings is that in all the regions they‚Äôve studied, mental health is worst for the youngest generations.</span></p><p><span>It didn‚Äôt used to be this way. There is a well-known finding in happiness research that, </span><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00148-020-00797-z" rel="">across nearly all nations</a><span>, happiness or well-being forms a U-shaped curve across the lifespan (See </span><a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781466891234/thehappinesscurve" rel="">Rauch, 2018</a><span>). Young adults and people in their 60s and 70s are happier than those in middle age. But that may be changing, </span><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.837638/full" rel="">especially for women</a><span>, as Gen Z (born in and after 1996) enters young adulthood.

The second important feature is their international coverage. So, let‚Äôs zoom in and explore the six domain scores that make up the MHQ, first for the global sample, and then for the region and culture we know best: the Anglosphere.</p><p><span>As you‚Äôll see if you read </span><a href="https://sapienlabs.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Sapien-Labs-Age-of-First-Smartphone-and-Mental-Wellbeing-Outcomes.pdf" rel="">the full report</a><span>, the next step after examining the overall MHQ scores is to examine scores on the six domains of mental functioning:</span></p><ul><li><p><strong>Mood &amp; Outlook</strong><span>: Includes items about optimism, calmness, anxiety, mood swings, sadness, and anger.&nbsp;</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Social Self</strong><span>: Includes items about self-worth, relationships with others, empathy, cooperation, aggression toward others&nbsp;</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Adaptability &amp; Resilience</strong><span>: includes items about adaptability to change, ability to learn, and emotional resilience.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Drive &amp; Motivation</strong><span>: Includes items about motivation, curiosity, enthusiasm, and addictions.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Cognition</strong><span>: Includes items about memory, decision-making and risk-taking, focus, and concentration, unwanted thoughts, hallucinations</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Mind-Body Connection:</strong><span> Includes items about sleep quality, energy level, appetite, and physical health issues.&nbsp;</span></p></li></ul><p>Figure 3 shows that for young women, all six domain scores show the same basic pattern as the MHQ: a consistent rise. You can also see that a few of the domains seem to rise more slowly or level off somewhat after the age of 13 or 14: Drive and motivation, Mind-body connection, and Cognition. However, the other three dimensions continue to rise all the way to age 18. The domain that rises fastest, meaning that it is most highly correlated with age of first smartphone, is the ‚Äúsocial self‚Äù domain.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffbff8dea-3dc7-4bef-9c12-a7bfcdd73794_1300x1168.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffbff8dea-3dc7-4bef-9c12-a7bfcdd73794_1300x1168.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffbff8dea-3dc7-4bef-9c12-a7bfcdd73794_1300x1168.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffbff8dea-3dc7-4bef-9c12-a7bfcdd73794_1300x1168.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffbff8dea-3dc7-4bef-9c12-a7bfcdd73794_1300x1168.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffbff8dea-3dc7-4bef-9c12-a7bfcdd73794_1300x1168.png" width="1300" height="1168" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/fbff8dea-3dc7-4bef-9c12-a7bfcdd73794_1300x1168.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1168,&quot;width&quot;:1300,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Mental Health Quotient Dimension Scores by age of first smartphone, Women&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="Mental Health Quotient Dimension Scores by age of first smartphone, Women" title="Mental Health Quotient Dimension Scores by age of first smartphone, Women" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffbff8dea-3dc7-4bef-9c12-a7bfcdd73794_1300x1168.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffbff8dea-3dc7-4bef-9c12-a7bfcdd73794_1300x1168.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffbff8dea-3dc7-4bef-9c12-a7bfcdd73794_1300x1168.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffbff8dea-3dc7-4bef-9c12-a7bfcdd73794_1300x1168.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><em><strong>Figure 3:</strong><span> The 6 domains of well-being, for young women, as a function of when they got their first smartphone.

For example, in the Sapien Labs dataset, in the less wealthy countries such as India, few young adults had received a smartphone before the age of 10, which means that the data points on the left sides of the graphs contain almost no Indians, whereas the data points on the right side (no phone until 17 or 18) contain many Indians and fewer from the USA. If Indians are mentally healthier than Americans (for other reasons), this could cause the lines to slope even if smartphones had no effect on mental health.

Changes are smaller and more varied compared to females.</span></em><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.afterbabel.com/p/sapien-smartphone-report/comments&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Leave a comment&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://www.afterbabel.com/p/sapien-smartphone-report/comments" rel=""><span>Leave a comment</span></a></p><p><span>It‚Äôs important to note that the report from Sapien Labs is one of their ‚Äúrapid reports‚Äù made possible by their fast-growing number of participants and the easy access they offer to their data. They added the question about age of first smartphone in January and they are publishing a report, with data from nearly 28,000 participants, in May. We believe that this ability to move quickly is a public service during a global pandemic of teen mental illness. While their rapid report is not a standard academic publication and has not been through peer review (which often takes a year or more), the open access to the data has allowed us to investigate and confirm the trends they are reporting. We hope and expect that other researchers will download the dataset and offer critiques of the data, the analyses, and the conclusions drawn. This sort of ‚Äú</span><a href="https://scholarlyassessmentreports.org/articles/10.29024/sar.26" rel="">post-publication peer review</a><span>‚Äù is becoming increasingly common as the problems with the existing peer review system become more widely known.</span></p><p><span>One issue to keep in mind with the Sapien Labs dataset is that the participants in each country are not a random or representative sample of the people in that country. Such studies would be extremely expensive to run, and now that so few people agree to phone solicitations or even answer their phones, it is unclear how representative such surveys can be. Those who agree to be interviewed, or who are motivated by money to participate, are not representative of the broader population. For this Sapien Labs report, participants came to the site on their own, or from online advertisements paid for by Sapien Labs, for the purpose of getting a detailed report on their wellbeing. So, the means reported for any country should not be treated like direct measures of the true means. However, samples such as these are still very useful for examining differences </span><em>within</em><span> the sample, such as those between men and women, or between those who got a smartphone early and those who got one late. And the much larger size of the Sapien Labs dataset, compared to Gallup and other survey organizations, allows for many additional analyses.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>A second factor to keep in mind is that like all surveys, what we get is correlational data that is open to alternative interpretations. The graphs in the report are likely to suggest to most readers that getting a smartphone early </span><em>causes</em><span> later mental health problems. But with correlational data we must always consider the possibility that the causal arrow could run in reverse. In this case: having low well-being as a young adult could </span><em>cause</em><span> people to believe that they got a smartphone earlier than they did, but this seems unlikely. We must also always consider that there could be ‚Äúthird variables‚Äù that cause both of the first two variables to rise. In this case, one plausible confounding third variable is </span><a href="https://www.canr.msu.edu/news/permissive_parenting_style#:~:text=Permissive%20parents%20are%20not%20demanding,than%20children%20of%20a%20parent." rel="">permissive parenting</a><span>. Perhaps permissive parents (in each country) simultaneously do two things: they give their kids smartphones at very young ages, and they also give them few boundaries and little structure, which then interferes with development and produces struggling young adults. While this hypothesis is plausible and should be investigated, it is not clear how it would explain the fact that, in all the regions studied, it is the </span><em>girls</em><span> who show a tighter connection between early phone acquisition and later mental health problems, just as it is the girls who show a </span><a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(18)30060-9/fulltext" rel="">tighter connection between heavy social media use</a><span> and concurrent mental health problems. Nor would it explain why mental health dropped so rapidly in the early 2010s (especially for girls) if permissive parenting (or some other variable about family life) was the real culprit.</span></p><p><span>And finally, we note that no one study is definitive, and more research is needed. We have been able to find a </span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160791X22001439" rel="">few</a><span> </span><a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/17482798.2020.1725902" rel="">other</a><span> </span><a href="https://srcd.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cdev.13851" rel="">studies</a><span> that </span><a href="https://wheatley.byu.edu/00000182-8d78-dff6-afab-8ffd11ce0001/teaching-by-example-pdf" rel="">examined</a><span> the age at which children got their first smartphones (We have created a new appendix [8.14] in our collaborative review doc on </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1w-HOfseF2wF9YIpXwUUtP65-olnkPyWcgF5BiAtBEy0/edit#" rel="">Social Media and Mental Health</a><span>). So far they are mostly smaller studies that have produced mixed results. If you know of any others, please add them to the doc or put a link to them in the comments below. We want to get this right.</span></p><p><span>We cannot be </span><em>certain</em><span> that the correlations shown in the data are evidence of causality, but we think it is appropriate for those who care for children to act on the </span><em>preponderance</em><span> of the evidence (which is the standard in a civil trial) rather than waiting for evidence </span><em>beyond a reasonable doubt </em><span>(which is the standard used in a criminal trial. See proposition 2 in </span><a href="https://jonathanhaidt.substack.com/p/why-some-researchers-think-im-wrong" rel="">this post</a><span>.) There is </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gojn35zOhnhfgdgquf5Tj4VsZk7Gtugt-eYS-2fQnpE/edit#" rel="">increasing evidence</a><span> that smartphones have a variety of detrimental effects on child development including reductions of sleep, focus, and time with friends in person, along with increases in addictive behaviors, so it makes sense that the cumulative effect of getting one‚Äôs first phone in elementary school would be larger than for those who don‚Äôt get a phone until high school. This is an important point made in the Sapien Labs report: The relationships they find suggest that there is a </span><em>cumulative effect</em><span> of having had a smartphone (and its many apps) over many years of childhood; they do not represent the effects of having used a phone a lot in recent days or weeks (which is the focus of </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1w-HOfseF2wF9YIpXwUUtP65-olnkPyWcgF5BiAtBEy0/edit" rel="">most of the published research</a><span>).</span></p><p><span>We think the implications for action are strongest for policies related to children and younger teens‚Äì‚Äìthose still in elementary and middle school (that is, age 14 and below) In most of the graphs in this post, including those for the Anglosphere, the slopes of the lines are steepest for those ages, and the links are visible for boys as well as girls (though smaller for boys). This concern to protect children before and during early puberty is consistent with a </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-29296-3" rel="">study published last year</a><span> which found that in a large longitudinal study of British adolescents, the peak years for evidence of links between social media use and lower satisfaction with life were 11-13 for girls (which corresponds to the early part of puberty), while for boys (who begin puberty a bit later) it was 14-15.</span></p><p>On the other hand, the implications for action related to older teens and especially boys are less clear, at least within the United States and other Anglosphere nations. The lines for boys are somewhat flat in those ages, and the increases for girls generally slow down too. Furthermore, the arguments for why high school students need a smartphone (rather than an alternative, such as a flip-phone) are stronger than the arguments for why elementary and middle school students need one.&nbsp;</p><p>We, therefore, believe that the Sapien Labs findings should motivate us to think carefully about whether and when to give children their own smart devices, especially before high school. It is not the Internet per se that is harmful; so much of the internet is fantastically educational, useful, and entertaining. The most relevant questions, we think, are: 1) At what age do you want to give a child continuous access to the internet and social media, even when away from home, even when sitting in class? 2) At what age do you want to give social media companies, and other companies, continuous access to a child‚Äôs attention? And 3) does a child really need a smartphone when other kinds of phones (such as ‚Äúflip phones‚Äù or Light Phones) work just as well for general communication (phone calls and texting)?</p><p><span>The group </span><a href="https://www.waituntil8th.org/" rel="">Wait Until 8th</a><span> was founded to solve the collective action problem that parents and teens are in: Even if most parents wanted to wait until high school to give their children smartphones and social media, as long as most kids have those things by 6th grade, there will be enormous pressure on their children, and hence on the parents, to relent. Unless the parents can coordinate. So Wait Until 8th asks parents to sign a pledge, when their children are in elementary school, that they will wait until 8th grade to give them a smartphone. The pledge only takes effect once ten families in that child‚Äôs grade have signed the pledge so that the child will have a community of peers and will not feel so isolated before 8th grade.</span></p><p>We think this is a great idea, we just suggest that the pledge should be: Wait Until 9th. Or Wait Until High School. Children are usually 12 or 13 at the start of 8th grade; that is still within the period of early puberty. Plus, if 8th graders have smartphones, that means that smartphones will be everywhere in middle schools, increasing the desire of 7th graders to get them. To solve collective action problems, we think it‚Äôs best to focus on setting good norms within collectives (such as schools): make elementary schools and middle schools be smartphone free.&nbsp;</p><p><span>Parents understandably want to be able to reach their children when they are away from home, and a flip phone or other ‚Äúdumbphone‚Äù is a very reasonable first phone that allows parents and children to reach each other. We suggest that parents not give smartphones as first phones. Let children learn to master a simpler kind of phone, one that cannot be loaded with addictive apps. Wait Until 8th offers an </span><a href="https://www.waituntil8th.org/devices" rel="">excellent list</a><span> of the many smartphone alternatives.</span></p><p><span>Many of the teachers and heads of schools that Jon talks to are bitter about the effects of smartphones on their students and their school culture. They complain about the constant drama unfolding on social media during the school day. They complain about the distraction and the increased difficulty of getting students‚Äô attention during class, since many students sneak looks at their frequently-buzzing phones, especially those sitting in the back rows. Many schools say that they ban phones, but what they often seem to mean is ‚Äúthe rule is that you can‚Äôt take out your phone during class.‚Äù That means that some students (the ones most suffering from phone addiction) will learn to do it stealthily, and many of the rest will just pull out their phones as soon as class is over, thereby </span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103122000634" rel="">missing out on face-to-face interactions</a><span> with the students right next to them.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>We suggest that schools consider going phone free, meaning that students can use their phones to arrive and depart from school, but once they enter, their phones (smart or dumb) would be placed in a phone locker, or in a lockable pouch. We think the case for doing this in elementary schools and middle schools is strongest. In a few weeks, Jon will write a substack post laying out the empirical evidence that smartphones distract students and disrupt education, </span><a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/691462" rel="">even when they are kept in students‚Äô pockets</a><span>.</span></p><p>We also suggest that school districts collaborate with social scientists to do experiments on entire schools, rather than on individual students. What if a state or district identified 20 middle schools that were willing to cooperate, and then randomly assigned half of them to go phone free?&nbsp; There is no research of this kind that we can find, yet such a simple study would give us results within a single year that could potentially yield findings that improve both mental health and educational outcomes.&nbsp;</p><p><span>If there is a cumulative effect of smartphone ownership in childhood, and if the effect is due in part to heavy use of certain kinds of apps (such as social media) rather than other kinds of apps (such as watching movies, or using Wikipedia), then it becomes even more vital that we develop ways of age-gating certain apps and content. At present, </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children%27s_Online_Privacy_Protection_Act" rel="">US law sets a minimum age of 13</a><span> at which children can sign contracts with companies to give away their data (when they check a box on the terms of service). But </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-13-became-the-internets-age-of-adulthood-11560850201" rel="">the law was written such that</a><span> the companies are not required to verify ages. As long as a child </span><em>says</em><span> that she is 13 or older, she‚Äôs in and can create a social media account.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>This must change. If the minimum age were enforced, it would help parents solve their collective action problem, at least with regard to Instagram, Tiktok, and other social media sites for underage users. It is precisely Congress‚Äôs failure to enforce the age 13 rule that puts parents in the trap. Many states are now introducing legislation to remedy this omission. And there is one federal bill that does a particularly good job of focusing on age limits and age verification: The </span><a href="https://www.schatz.senate.gov/news/press-releases/schatz-cotton-murphy-britt-introduce-bipartisan-legislation-to-help-protect-kids-from-harmful-impacts-of-social-media" rel="">Protecting Kids on Social Media Act</a><span>, introduced by Senators Schatz (D-HI), Cotton (R-AR), Murphy (D-CT), and Britt (R-AL). The act would ‚Äúset a minimum age of 13 to use social media apps and would require parental consent for 13 through 17 year-olds.&nbsp; The bill would also prevent social media companies from feeding content using algorithms to users under the age of 18.‚Äù The bill also requires social media companies to develop rigorous age verification methods. (There are already many in existence, and many more would appear if the bill gets passed.) We also think the </span><a href="https://www.blackburn.senate.gov/2023/5/blackburn-blumenthal-introduce-bipartisan-kids-online-safety-act" rel="">Kids Online Safety Act of 2022</a><span>, introduced by senators Blumenthal (D-CT) and Blackburn (R-TN) would do a lot to make social media less damaging to children, and easier for parents to control. The fact that so many bills are bipartisan, at both the state and federal level, is a very encouraging sign in our polarized time. Legislators often report seeing the problems in their own children.</span></p><p><strong>In conclusion:</strong><span> there is a great deal that can be done, individually and collectively, to address one of the top fears that parents express, about the safety and health of their children. The Sapien Labs data offers us new insight into the nature of the problem, and it alerts us that the problem may be global. It also guides us to the ages at which reform efforts are most likely to work.</span></p><p>POSTSCRIPTS (added on May 18, 2023)</p><p>1‚ÄîWe welcome additional and deeper analyses of the Sapien Labs data, and will post links here to such reports whether they support or contradict our analyses in this post.</p><p><span>2‚ÄîOne issue we should have discussed in the text is the inclusion of </span><em>tablets</em><span>, along with smartphones, in the Sapien Labs‚Äô questionnaire. If their findings differ from those of other labs which asked only about age of first </span><em>smartphone</em><span>, then we won‚Äôt know whether part of the difference is the inclusion of tablets. We hope that future studies will ask about the two devices separately to figure out which devices are associated with harm at which ages (if any). </span></p><p>3‚ÄîSome commentary online has made the important point that it‚Äôs not the phone itself which is harmful; it is the particular apps that the child uses, a child with a particular personality, in the context of a particular family that does (or does not) exercise oversight and apply restrictions. We agree. The original iPhone introduced by Steve Jobs was three devices: a phone, an iPod, and a web browser. Great! Three tools. Probably not harmful. It‚Äôs the addition of the app store that turned the smartphone into a portal to everything. If early acquisition of a smartphone is shown to be reliably associated with developmental problems, it would likely be because it enables continuous 18-hour-per-day access to hundreds of activities. </p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>In 2019, a startup called Nuvia came out of stealth mode. Nuvia was notable because its leadership included several notable chip architects, including <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/05/01/apple_nuvia_lawsuit/">one who used to work for Apple</a>. Apple chips like the M1 drew recognition for landing in the same performance neighborhood as AMD and Intel‚Äôs offerings while offering better power efficiency. Nuvia had similar goals, aiming to create a power efficient core that could could surpass designs from AMD, Apple, Arm, and Intel. Qualcomm acquired Nuvia in 2021, bringing its staff into Qualcomm‚Äôs internal CPU efforts.</p>

<p>Bringing on Nuvia staff rejuvenated Qualcomm‚Äôs internal CPU efforts, which led to the Oryon core in Snapdragon X Elite. Oryon arrives nearly five years after Nuvia hit the news, and almost eight years after Qualcomm last released a smartphone SoC with internally designed cores.

<p>Now, thanks to the wonderful folks who donate to our <a href="https://www.patreon.com/ChipsandCheese">Patreon members</a> and <a href="https://www.paypal.com/donate?hosted_button_id=4EMPH66SBGVSQ">Paypal donators</a>, we have a Samsung Galaxy Book4 Edge 16 inch Laptop equipped with a Qualcomm Snapdragon X1E-80-100 CPU in our possession.</p>
<p>Note, because there has not been any upstreamed Device Tree for this laptop, we were not able to get a Linux desktop installed on it so a lot of our testing had to be done on Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).</p>
<h2>System Architecture</h2>
<p>The Snapdragon X1E-80-10 implements 12 Oryon cores in three quad-core clusters, each with a 12 MB L2 cache. Like Kryo in the Snapdragon 820, Qualcomm opted against a hybrid core configuration. Instead, Snapdragon X Elite‚Äôs Oryon CPU clusters run at different maximum clocks to offer a combination of good single threaded and multithreaded performance.</p>

<p>Snapdragon X Elite‚Äôs clustered arrangement is clearly visible from a core to core latency test, which bounces cachelines between core pairs and measures how long that takes. Transfers within a core are handled reasonably quickly, but cross-cluster transfers incur high latency especially for a monolithic chip with consumer core counts.</p>

<p>Latencies are less consistent compared to Qualcomm‚Äôs prior attempt at making a laptop chip. The 8cx Gen 3 has four Cortex X1 cores and four Cortex A78 cores. It likely uses Arm‚Äôs DSU interconnect, which also implements a shared L3 cache.</p>

<p>Nuvia‚Äôs co-founder used to work for Apple, making M1 is a notable comparison point. Apple also uses quad core clusters with a shared L2. However, M1 uses a hybrid core arrangement. Core to core latency is similar within a cluster. Cross-cluster transfers incur high latency much like on Snapdragon X Elite, though absolute values are a bit better.</p>

<p>Snapdragon X Elite‚Äôs main competitors will be AMD‚Äôs Phoenix and Intel‚Äôs Meteor Lake. AMD‚Äôs Phoenix SoC has eight Zen 4 cores with 16 MB of L3. All eight of Phoenix‚Äôs cores are placed in the same cluster, so a core to core latency test is pretty boring to look at. Latencies are very low overall. However, it‚Äôs worth noting that AMD‚Äôs cross-cluster latencies on 16 core desktop Zen 4 variants is still better than Snapdragon X Elite or M1‚Äôs, at 80-90 ns.</p>

<p>Intel‚Äôs Meteor Lake has a complex hybrid setup with six Redwood Cove performance cores, eight Crestmont efficiency cores, and two Crestmont low power cores.

<h2>Clock Behavior</h2>
<p>CPUs conserve power by reducing clocks when idle. Transitioning from idle to a high performance state takes time. On battery power, the Snapdragon X Elite doesn‚Äôt reach maximum clock speeds until over 110 ms after load is applied. This is almost certainly a deliberate policy on Samsung‚Äôs part to extend battery life by avoiding high power states during short bursts of activity. Intel‚Äôs Meteor Lake takes that strategy to the extreme, and does not reach maximum boost clocks on battery. AMD has a very fast boost policy on both wall and battery power, reaching 5 GHz in a millisecond or less.</p>

<p>On wall power, Samsung has opted not to let the CPU idle. This allows for better responsiveness because the cores start out at 3.4 GHz, and can reach 4 GHz in 1.44 milliseconds. However, it makes the laptop noticeably warm even at idle, a trait not shared by Meteor Lake or Phoenix.</p>
<h2>Core Overview</h2>
<p>Qualcomm‚Äôs Oryon is an 8-wide core with very high reordering capacity. True to its lineage, Oryon inherits philosophies from both Apple‚Äôs Firestorm and Qualcomm‚Äôs own much older Kryo. But unlike Kryo and M1, Oryon can run at 4 GHz and beyond. The top end Snapdragon X Elite SKU can reach 4.3 GHz on two cores. The X1E-80-100 we tested here can reach 4 GHz.</p>

<p>Zen 4 still has a clock speed advantage, but the gap isn‚Äôt as big with mobile. Next to Oryon, Zen 4‚Äôs architecture looks tiny. It‚Äôs only 6-wide and has smaller out-of-order buffers. However, Zen 4 can run at higher clock speeds. The Ryzen 7840HS can reach 5.1 GHz in the HP ZBook Firefly 14 G10 A.</p>

<p>Qualcomm states that Oryon has a 13 cycle misprediction penalty, which is the same as the common case for Zen 4.</p>
<h2>Branch Predictor</h2>
<p>The branch predictor is one of the best ways to get more performance per joule of energy spent. Modern CPUs therefore invest heavily in branch prediction. As core width and reordering capacity increase, an accurate branch predictor gets even more important because a mispredict tends to cause more wasted work.</p>
<h4>Direction Prediction</h4>
<p>The direction predictor does exactly as it sounds, it tells the branch predictor what direction the branch is likely to go. Oryon appears to have a single level direction predictor much like Golden Cove.</p>

<p>Oryon Branch Prediction Unit direction predictor does well against Golden Cove but does struggle against Zen 4.</p>

<h3>Branch Target Caching</h3>
<p>A branch predictor‚Äôs job can be simplified to telling the frontend what address it should fetch from next. Part of that involves determining whether a branch is taken. If it is, the predictor needs to tell the frontend where that branch goes with minimal delay. Branch Target Buffers (BTBs) cache branch destination addresses to speed that process up. Like any cache, different BTB implementations have varying performance characteristics. Modern CPUs often have multi-level BTBs too to get a balance between speed and ability to cope with large branch footprints.</p>
<p>Oryon appears to tie its BTB to the instruction cache, as taken branches see higher latency as the test loop spills out of the instruction cache. Branches contained within a 8 KB footprint can be handled with single cycle latency, something AMD calls ‚Äúzero bubble‚Äù branching. Applications with a larger branch footprint can do one taken branch every three cycles, as long as code fits in the 192 KB L1 instruction cache.</p>

<p>Qualcomm could have a branch address calculator placed early in the decode pipeline. With that interpretation, Oryon would have a 8 KB L0 instruction cache with single cycle latency. The 192 KB L1i would have 3 cycle latency. Oryon‚Äôs BTB setup has parallels to Kryo‚Äôs, as both cores enjoy fast branching as long as the test fits within 8 KB. It also shares traits with M1, which also sees taken branch latency increase as the test exceeds certain code footprint sizes. M1 however only gets single cycle branching within 4 KB.</p>

<p>AMD‚Äôs Zen 4, as well as Arm Ltd and Intel cores for that matter, decouple their branch target caching from the instruction cache. Clam‚Äôs BTB test sees higher latency once branches exceed certain counts, with branch spacing being less of a factor.</p>

<p>Oryon‚Äôs indirect predictor isn‚Äôt as big as Zen 4‚Äôs 3072 entry indirect branch predictor and can‚Äôt track as many targets. But unlike Zen 4, there is no slowly increasing penalty after 32 targets for a single branch. This likely means that Oryon doesn‚Äôt use a similar mechanism to Zen 4. Now comparing Oryon to Golden Cove and they are very similar to each other but Oryon can track more targets than Golden Cove can.</p>
<p>Returns are a special case of indirect branches. Oryon has a deep 48 entry return stack. Zen 4 for comparison has a 32 entry return stack. Both are quite deep, and likely enough to handle the vast majority of code. Qualcomm‚Äôs strategy mirrors that of Apple M1‚Äôs Firestorm architecture, which <a href="https://twitter.com/dougallj/status/1580826539205496832">apparently has a 50 entry return stack</a>.</p>

<p>When return stack capacity is exceeded, Oryon sees a sharp increase in call+return time. 4-5 ns would be 15-18 cycles at 3.7 GHz, which is high enough to be a branch mispredict. That‚Äôs similar to what Dougall discovered on Apple‚Äôs M1 too, and suggests the core clears the return stack when it overflows instead of implementing a mechanism to more gracefully handle that case.</p>
<h2>Fetch and Decode</h2>
<p>Next, the frontend has to fetch instructions from memory and decode them into micro-ops. Oryon and Apple‚Äôs Firestorm cores use a very similar strategy. Both have a huge 192 KB L1 instruction cache feeding a 8-wide decoder. AMD‚Äôs Zen 4 enjoys high instruction bandwidth for small instruction footprints, but sustained bandwidth is restricted by Zen 4‚Äôs 6-wide rename stage downstream. Compared to Oryon and Firestorm, Zen 4c‚Äôs small 32 KB instruction cache is a distinct disadvantage.</p>

Zen 4 is capped at 6 micro-ops per cycle. Throughput from the micro-op cache is higher in this simple test because Zen 4 fuses adjacent NOPs into a single micro-op</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>However, AMD maintains high frontend bandwidth for very large code footprints, as it can sustain more than 12 bytes per cycle even when pulling code from L3. Oryon and M1 have much lower code fetch bandwidth after a L1i miss.</p>
<h2>Rename/Allocate</h2>
<p>Micro-ops from the frontend need to have backend resources allocated to track them during out-of-order execution. That process involves register renaming to break false write-after-write dependencies. The renamer can break other dependencies as well by creatively allocating backend resources. For example, an instruction that moves values between registers can be eliminated by having its ‚Äúresult‚Äù point to the source register. Instructions known to set a register to zero can similarly be optimized.</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td>Oryon IPC</td><td>Zen 4 IPC</td><td>Redwood Cove IPC</td></tr><tr><td>Independent MOVs</td><td>7.4</td><td>5.73</td><td>4.77</td></tr><tr><td>Dependent MOVs</td><td>1.18</td><td>5.71</td><td>5.25</td></tr><tr><td>XOR/EOR r, r</td><td>1</td><td>5.73</td><td>4.05</td></tr><tr><td>MOV r, 0</td><td>5.32</td><td>3.77</td><td>4.97</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>Oryon has move elimination, though it‚Äôs not as robust as Intel or AMD‚Äôs implementation for chained dependent MOVs. There‚Äôs no zeroing idiom recognition for XOR-ing a register with itself, or subtracting a register from itself. Moving an immediate value of zero to a register works of course for breaking dependencies. However, throughput for that doesn‚Äôt exceed 6 IPC and suggests Oryon still uses an ALU pipe to write zero to a register.</p>
<h2>Out of Order Execution</h2>
<p>Oryon features a massive out-of-order execution engine to hide latency and extract instruction level parallelism. Its reorder buffer, which helps commit instruction results in program order, is massive with 680 entries. Both the integer and floating point register files have 384 entries available for speculative results. Add another 32 entries for known-good architectural register values, and that comes out to 416 total entries.</p>

<p>Memory ordering queues are more conservatively sized. The load and store queues have 192 and 56 entries respectively. While the load queue has comparable capacity to Redwood Cove‚Äôs and is appropriately sized to cover the reorder buffer, the store queue feels a bit small. It‚Äôs strange to see </p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td>Structure</td><td>Applies to instructions that‚Ä¶</td><td>Oryon</td><td>Zen 4</td><td>Redwood Cove</td></tr><tr><td>Reorder Buffer (ROB)</td><td>Exist</td><td>680 entry</td><td>320 entry</td><td>512 entry</td></tr><tr><td>Integer register file</td><td>Write to a 64-bit scalar integer register</td><td>416 entry</td><td>224 entry</td><td>288 entry</td></tr><tr><td>FP/vector register file</td><td>Write to a FP/vector register</td><td>416 entry</td><td>192 entry</td><td>320 entry</td></tr><tr><td>Load queue</td><td>Read from memory</td><td>192 entry</td><td>136 entry</td><td>192 entry (measured)<br>240 entry (SPR slides)</td></tr><tr><td>Store queue</td><td>Write to memory</td><td>56 entry</td><td>64 entry</td><td>112 entry</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>Where Oryon really excels is scheduling capacity. Schedulers are expensive structures because every cycle, they have to check all their entries for micro-ops that are ready to execute. And, they have to see if results coming from freshly completed micro-ops make any pending micro-ops ready. Doing all those checks and comparisons can make schedulers area and power hungry. Qualcomm has likely kept costs down by associating each scheduling queue with one execution port, ensuring each scheduler only has to select one micro-op per cycle.</p>

<p>Oryon can bring an incredible 120 scheduler entries to bear for basic integer operations alone. It‚Äôs just short of Firestorm‚Äôs 134 entries, and far higher than Zen 4‚Äôs 96 entries. The gap between Oryon and Zen 4 is even wider because Zen 4‚Äôs ALU scheduling entries are shared with memory access operations. Intel‚Äôs Redwood Cove has 97 scheduling entries shared by integer and FP/vector operations.</p>
<p>On the FP/vector side, Oryon similarly has massive scheduling capacity. Arm CPUs traditionally featured weak vector execution, since handing throughput bound workloads would be difficult in a smartphone or tablet power budget. x86 applications however have different expectations, and users expect to carry out intensive tasks locally instead of sending them to be processed on a remote server. Oryon tackles this by feeding four 128-bit execution ports with a total of 192 scheduler entries. All four pipes can handle basic floating point and vector integer operations.</p>

<p>In that respect Oryon is very similar to Firestorm, though the two cores differ in how they handle less common operations. Firestorm also stands apart in using smaller (though still large in an absolute sense) schedulers, and compensating for that with a non-scheduling queue that can delay a stall at the rename stage.</p>
<p>AMD again has the lowest scheduling capacity, instead using a huge non-scheduling queue to prevent full schedulers from causing stalls further up the pipeline. Still, Zen 4‚Äôs buffering capacity for incomplete FP/vector operations falls far short of Oryon. However, AVX(2) and AVX-512 can still give Zen 4 an edge, because wide vector operations do more work with a single micro-op. Intel‚Äôs Redwood Cove similarly stands to benefit from wider vectors, though Meteor Lake‚Äôs hybrid core setup prevents it from supporting AVX-512. </p>
<p>Oryon‚Äôs FP/vector side feels like it‚Äôs about as strong as any NEON/ASIMD setup can reasonably be. Without SVE support, Oryon can‚Äôt use vectors wider than 128-bits. Supporting FMA ops on all four pipes gives it similar floating point throughput to Zen 4, but and potentially gives Oryon an advantage with code that doesn‚Äôt use vectors wider than 128 bits. But feeding that setup requires 12 FP register file ports, because each FMA needs three inputs. Pulling that off with a 416 entry register file sounds expensive.</p>

<p>Oryon has less scheduling capacity for address generation ops compared to math ones, but four 16 entry schedulers are nothing to sneeze at. Together, those schedulers can hold more micro-ops than Firestorm‚Äôs AGU scheduling and non-scheduling queues combined. Zen 4 can theoretically keep 72 incomplete address generation operations in flight, but those entries are shared with integer math operations.</p>
<h2>Address Translation</h2>
<p>On any modern CPU, programs operate on virtual addresses that get translated on-the-fly to physical addresses. Address translation caches, called Translation Lookaside Buffers (TLBs), help accelerate this by caching frequently used translations. Oryon features very large TLBs, helping reduce address translation latency.</p>

<p>Oryon‚Äôs first level data TLB has 224 entries and is 7 way set associative, providing 896 KB of coverage with 4K pages. That‚Äôs a lot of capacity compared to first level TLBs on AMD and Intel CPUs. It‚Äôs reminiscent of Kryo‚Äôs 192 entry L1 DTLB, which similarly provided fast address translation coverage over a relatively large address space. And, it‚Äôs refreshing to see next to AMD, Intel, and Arm‚Äôs small L1 DTLBs.</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td>Level</td><td>Oryon</td><td>Zen 4</td><td>Apple Firestorm</td></tr><tr><td>L1 DTLB</td><td>224 entry 7-way</td><td>72 entry fully associative</td><td>160 entry</td></tr><tr><td>L2 TLB</td><td>8K+ entry 8-way<br>7 cycle latency</td><td>3072 entry 24-way<br>7-8 cycle latency</td><td>3072 entry</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>But unlike Kryo, which dropped L1 TLB misses on the floor, Oryon has a large second level TLB with over 8K entries. Getting a translation from the L2 TLB appears to take 7 extra cycles, which is good especially considering Oryon‚Äôs 4 GHz+ clocks and the size of the L2 TLB.</p>

<p>Measurements return confusing results though, showing an increase in address translation penalties past 6 MB. That would correspond to 1536 L2 TLB entries, which is far short of the 12 MB that Zen 4‚Äôs L2 TLB would cover. Testing sizes past 128 MB shows another increase, but that doesn‚Äôt correspond to 8K entries * 4K pages = 32 MB. </p>
<h2>Cache and Memory Access</h2>
<p>Oryon uses an Apple-like caching strategy. A large 96 KB L1 and relatively fast L2 with 20 cycles of latency together mean Oryon doesn‚Äôt need a mid-level cache. Firestorm has a bigger 128 KB L1, but Oryon‚Äôs L1 is still much larger than the 32 or 48 KB L1 caches in Zen 4 or Redwood Cove.</p>

<p>AMD has a 1 MB L2 mid-level cache private to each core, then a 16 MB L3. That setup makes it easier to increase caching capacity, because the L2 cache can insulate the core from L3 latency. However, that advantage is minimal for mobile Zen 4 parts, which max out at 16 MB of L3. Oryon therefore provides competitive latency especially as accesses spill out of Zen 4‚Äôs L2. Meteor Lake follows a similar caching strategy to Zen 4, but has more caching capacity at the expense of higher latency.</p>

<p>After L2, Oryon has a 6 MB System Level Cache (SLC) with a claimed latency of 26-29 ns. Test sizes between 12 and 18 MB generally align with that. For example, latency at 14 MB was approximately 25 ns using 2 MB pages. Accurately assessing SLC latency is difficult because many accesses within even a 18 MB array will result in L2 hits. The SLC‚Äôs low capacity compared to the L2 cache will likely limit its relevance for CPU-side code.</p>
<p>DRAM latency is 110.9 ns with a 1 GB array, which isn‚Äôt far off Qualcomm‚Äôs claimed 102-104 ns. The Ryzen 7840HS achieves somewhat lower latency at 103.3 ns, likely because it uses DDR5 memory instead of LPDDR5X. Meteor Lake‚Äôs memory latency is worse at over 140 ns.</p>
<h3>Bandwidth</h3>
<p>x86 CPUs traditionally had a strong focus on vector execution, and have plenty of cache bandwidth to support their vector units. Oryon competes surprisingly well in this area. There‚Äôs no SVE support, but Oryon takes 128-bit vector widths about as far as they‚Äôll reasonably go with support for four 128-bit loads per cycle. That‚Äôs a match for Zen 4‚Äôs 2√ó256-bit load bandwidth, though a bit behind Redwood Cove‚Äôs 3√ó256-bit load capability. </p>
<p>Oryon‚Äôs large L1 cache capacity should let it hold up well for smaller data footprints, but AMD and Intel‚Äôs mid-level caches provide a bandwidth advantage if data spills out of L1. AMD‚Äôs L3 also does a good job, providing more bandwidth to a single core than Qualcomm‚Äôs L2. Apple‚Äôs Firestorm doesn‚Äôt emphasize vector workloads and is outpaced by other cores in this comparison.</p>

<p>When reading from DRAM, a single Oryon core can achieve an incredible 80 GB/s of bandwidth. Qualcomm says each core can have over 50 in-flight requests to the system, and a L2 instance can track over 220 memory transactions. Those large queues are likely why a single Oryon core can pull so much bandwidth from DRAM.</p>

<p>Shared caches get put under more pressure under multithreaded loads, as more cores ask for bandwidth. Oryon handles this well, with the L2 providing nearly 330 GB/s of bandwidth to four cores. That‚Äôs about 82 GB/s per core, and just a bit lower than the 100 GB/s an Oryon core can get without contention.</p>

<p>Again, AMD and Intel enjoy lots of bandwidth from their core-private L2 caches, and AMD‚Äôs L3 continues to shine for larger data footprints. Intel‚Äôs Redwood Cove P-Cores have very high cache bandwidth, but that advantage falls off once data spills out into L3.</p>
<p>For all-core workloads, Oryon trades blows with Phoenix depending on which level of the memory hierarchy we hit. L1 cache bandwidth is comparable, with AMD‚Äôs eight Zen 4 cores clocking higher to take a slight lead. AMD enjoys about 25% higher L2 bandwidth across all cores. Intel‚Äôs Meteor Lake generally has a bandwidth lead thanks to a combination of high core count and Redwood Cove‚Äôs 3√ó256-bit per cycle load capability. However, the lead is less significant when all threads are loaded because of clock speed drops and lower bandwidth E-Cores coming into play.</p>

<p>As test sizes exceed AMD‚Äôs L2 capacity, Qualcomm‚Äôs three L2 instances can provide 16% more bandwidth than AMD‚Äôs L3. Snapdragon X Elite has three 12 MB L2 instances for 36 MB of total capacity. Using three L3 instances makes it easier to provide high bandwidth too.</p>
<p>Finally, Qualcomm has much higher DRAM bandwidth thanks to fast LPDDR5X. With over 110 GB/s of measured read bandwidth, the Snapdragon X Elite is comfortably ahead of both Phoenix and Meteor Lake.</p>
<h2>Cinebench 2024</h2>
<p>Maxon‚Äôs Cinebench has been a benchmarking staple for years because it‚Äôs able to scale with core count. Modern CPUs have a lot of cores, but delivering high multithreaded performance in a limited power budget is very difficult. Cinebench 2024 has a native ARM64 build, so the Snapdragon X Elite will be free from binary translation penalties.</p>

<p>Qualcomm does very well. SMT helps AMD by giving each Zen 4 core explicit parallelism to work with. However, that‚Äôs not enough to counter the Snapdragon X Elite‚Äôs higher core count. The Snapdragon X Elite has 12 cores to AMD‚Äôs eight, and comes away with a 8.4% performance lead while drawing just 2% more power. From another perspective though, each Zen 4 core punches above its weight. Qualcomm is bringing 50% more cores to the table, and bigger cores too. Snapdragon X Elite should be crushing the competition on paper, but thermal and power restrictions prevent it from pulling away.</p>

<p>Qualcomm‚Äôs slides suggest a higher power reference device can indeed achieve such results. Higher core counts need more power and better cooling to shine. We don‚Äôt know what clock speeds Qualcomm‚Äôs higher power reference device was able to sustain. In the Samsung Book Edge4, the Snapdragon X Elite averaged 2.71 GHz. In the HP ZBook Firefly G10 A, the Ryzen 7840HS averaged 3.75 GHz, explaining how AMD‚Äôs able to get so close with fewer cores.</p>
<p>Intel‚Äôs Meteor Lake has an even higher core count but fails to impress at similar platform power. It‚Äôs only slightly faster than Apple‚Äôs M2. In the Asus Zenbook 14 OLED, the Core Ultra 7 155H‚Äôs Redwood Cove P-Cores averaged 2.75 GHz. The Crestmont E-Cores averaged 2.33 GHz. One of the six P-Cores and the two LPE-Cores didn‚Äôt see significant load during the Cinebench 2024 run.</p>
<h2>Final Words</h2>
<p>Oryon combines design philosophies from both Firestorm and the company‚Äôs much older Kryo. The result is a very solid architecture, because Qualcomm took care to bring forward the best of those worlds. Qualcomm has wanted to move beyond smartphones and take a chunk of the laptop market for a long time, and Snapdragon X Elite is the strongest shot the company has taken yet. On paper, 12 big Oryon cores should be a formidable opponent for both AMD‚Äôs eight Zen 4 cores and Meteor Lake‚Äôs 16 cores of various types.</p>
<p>We‚Äôll leave detailed benchmarking to mainstream tech sites, since they can do so in a more controlled environment and have the budget to provide more comparison points. But at a glance, Snapdragon X Elite provides competitive performance when running native applications. Even with binary translation, Oryon is fast enough to provide usable performance. With that in mind, Oryon has fulfilled two of the conditions that drove Apple Firestorm‚Äôs 2020 success.</p>

<p>But Snapdragon X Elite has a steeper hill to climb than Apple‚Äôs M1. Where Apple Silicon was the only upgrade option within the Apple ecosystem, PC customers have up-to-date AMD and Intel options to choose from. The PC ecosystem owes its popularity and staying power to a tradition of excellent software compatibility. Oryon relies on binary translation to execute x86 code, which comes with a performance penalty. Compatibility expectations extend to the operating system too. PC users expect to be able to (re)install an operating system of their choice. Generally a stock Linux or Windows image will boot on x86 CPUs going back several generations, regardless of device or motherboard manufacturer. Arm devices suffer from severe platform fragmentation, and Snapdragon X Elite is no exception. OS images have to be customized for each laptop, even ones that use the same Oryon cores.</p>

<p>Finally, Snapdragon X Elite devices are too expensive. Phoenix and Meteor Lake laptops often cost less, even when equipped with more RAM and larger SSDs. Convincing consumers to pay more for lower specifications is already a tough sell. Compatibility issues make it even tougher. Qualcomm needs to work with OEMs to deliver competitive prices. Lower prices will encourage skeptical consumers to try Snapdragon X Elite, getting more devices into circulation. That in turn leads to more developers with ARM64 Windows devices and more ARM64 native applications.</p>
<p>Qualcomm has their work cut out for them. We look forward to their next generation of CPU cores, and hope it‚Äôll be strong enough to keep pace with AMD and Intel‚Äôs next generation products.</p>

			<p>From a trash-filled Earth to the futuristic <i>Axiom</i> and back again, <i>WALL¬∑E</i> is a finely crafted balance between consumerist dystopia and sixties space-race optimism. Please join me, then, for a detailed dive&nbsp;into the uniquely robotic future of a remarkably human film, as seen through the eyes of its eponymous hero, WALL¬∑E.</p>

<p><em>[This article is from the&nbsp;</em><a href="https://typesetinthefuture.com/book/">Typeset in the Future book</a><i>, which is really very good&nbsp;and you‚Äôre&nbsp;probably going to want to&nbsp;</i><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1419727141/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=titf0f-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=1419727141&amp;linkId=b321076a05a18b3ffdfd5fd8924ad645">buy a copy of</a><i>. If you‚Äôd rather read the article first, don‚Äôt worry‚ÄîI‚Äôll remind you again later on.]</i></p>
<p>Before we get started, there is an important detail we must clear up. Our hero‚Äôs name is not, as you might think, WALL-E. Moreover, it <i>definitely</i> isn‚Äôt WALL‚Ä¢E. His name is <em>WALL¬∑E</em>, and that dot is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpunct">interpunct</a>, not a hyphen or a bullet.</p>
<figure data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_1492" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1492"><a href="https://typesetinthefuture.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/walle_0_02_37_2_full.jpg"><img src="https://typesetinthefuture.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/walle_0_02_37_2.jpg?w=1000" alt="walle_0_02_37_2" srcset="https://typesetinthefuture.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/walle_0_02_37_2.jpg 560w, https://typesetinthefuture.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/walle_0_02_37_2.jpg?w=150&amp;h=62 150w, https://typesetinthefuture.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/walle_0_02_37_2.jpg?w=300&amp;h=125 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1492">WALL¬∑E‚Äôs front plate, clearly showing his interpunct.</figcaption></figure>
<p>An interpunct is, of course, a vertically centered dot originally used to separate words in Latin and ancient Greek. (Spaces weren‚Äôt invented until several centuries later.) The interpunct is still in use today‚Äîit‚Äôs the official decimal point in British currency (¬£9¬∑99), and is used to represent the dot product of two vectors in mathematics (x ¬∑ y). Most relevantly, it‚Äôs used in Japanese to separate titles, names, and positions, as in ‚ÄúË™≤Èï∑Ë£ú‰Ωê ¬∑ Èà¥Êú®‚Äù (Assistant Section Head ¬∑ Suzuki). It is therefore entirely appropriate as the separator in WALL¬∑E, which is short for Waste Allocation Load Lifter ¬∑ Earth Class.</p>
<p>The bold extended typeface seen on WALL¬∑E‚Äôs front plate is Gunship, designed by Dan Zadorozny, one of the unsung heroes of modern sci-fi type design. Dan is an amateur type designer from Texas whose <a href="http://iconian.com/">Iconian Fonts website</a> features more than six hundred free hand-crafted typefaces, many of which have been used by sci-fi movies, TV shows, and book designers.</p>
<p>In addition to WALL¬∑E‚Äôs front plate, Gunship is seen on Earth and aboard the <i>Axiom</i>, the flagship spacecraft of megacorporation Buy n Large (BnL, for short), most notably for robot-facing wall and door typography. Its upper- and lowercase variants include different combinations of cutouts and curve orientations, giving designers flexibility when crafting robot signage. (Strictly speaking, this means that our hero‚Äôs name, correctly capitalized, is ‚ÄúwaLL¬∑e,‚Äù with the interpunct as a further customization‚ÄîGunship‚Äôs own interpunct is rectangular.)</p>

<p>The movie begins with an insight into WALL¬∑E‚Äôs typical workday, which is spent building gigantic piles of trash by compacting waste into neat, stackable cubes. After a hard day‚Äôs crushing, we follow him on his journey home, learning some useful exposition along the way. This includes a bank of electronic ads for BnL, promoting everything from liquid air to quadruple-patty burgers. Common throughout these ads is an insistence on immediate consumption‚Äî‚ÄúDRINK NOW,‚Äù ‚ÄúHUNGRY NOW,‚Äù ‚ÄúRUN NOW,‚Äù ‚ÄúCONSUME.‚Äù And if consuming a product once isn‚Äôt enough, you can repeat the experience a second time‚Äîthe signage seen below includes ads for both ‚Äú100% Reused Food‚Äù and ‚ÄúRegurgi-Shake: Twice the Flavor.‚Äù</p>
<p><a href="https://typesetinthefuture.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/walle_0_04_02_full.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://typesetinthefuture.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/walle_0_04_02.jpg?w=1000" alt="walle_0_04_02" srcset="https://typesetinthefuture.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/walle_0_04_02.jpg 560w, https://typesetinthefuture.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/walle_0_04_02.jpg?w=150&amp;h=62 150w, https://typesetinthefuture.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/walle_0_04_02.jpg?w=300&amp;h=125 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px"></a></p>
<p>We‚Äôve seen how corporate mergers, such as <a href="https://typesetinthefuture.com/2014/12/01/alien/"><i>Alien</i>‚Äôs Weylan Yutani</a> and <a href="https://typesetinthefuture.com/2016/06/19/bladerunner/"><i>Blade Runner</i>‚Äôs Shimata-Dominguez</a>, are an inevitability in sci-fi futures. <i>WALL¬∑E</i>‚Äôs Buy n Large is similar, except that this company was formed by a merger between a frozen yogurt manufacturer (Buy Yogurt) and a maker of suits for the larger gentleman (Large Industries). Clearly a marriage made in heaven, this corporate combination led to a rapid expansion, culminating with Buy n Large owning every company and government in the world.</p>
<p>The Buy n Large logo is an over-italicized customization of Futura Extra Bold Oblique, as demonstrated by a super-distinctive capital G in the BUY N LARGE BANK logotype that WALL¬∑E passes early in the movie.</p>

<p>If the red-and-blue logo feels familiar, it shouldn‚Äôt be a surprise‚Äîit‚Äôs because BnL uses the exact same typeface and color scheme as real-world retail giant <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costco">Costco Wholesale Corporation</a>.</p>

<p>There‚Äôs another curious BnL subsidiary to be found among the city‚Äôs electronic ads, on a beaten-up billboard advertising ‚ÄúEggman Movers (Creating More Space).‚Äù This company is an Easter-egg reference to WALL¬∑E production designer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Eggleston">Ralph ‚ÄúEggman‚Äù Eggleston</a>, and it shares the name of the moving company from 1995‚Äôs <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toy_Story">Toy Story</a></em>, for which Ralph was art director.</p>

<p>The presence of a Buy n Large‚Äìbranded bank means Buy n Large‚Äìbranded banknotes, which are unusual for being strewn across the floor of the deserted city. If you look closely at the notes, you‚Äôll see that some of them have ‚Äú10<sup>6</sup>‚Äù in the corner, and are marked ‚Äúten million dollars.‚Äù Others look to be marked ‚Äú99<sup>6</sup>,‚Äù suggesting that Buy n Large stores continued the classic $9.99 pricing trick even after adding six zeroes to the end of everything. (Indeed, it says much about the Buy n Large approach to consumerism that it prints notes with the 99s already included, to avoid customers having to receive any change.)</p>

<p>We discover later in the movie that the <em>Axiom</em> left Earth in the year 2105. This suggests that in the preceding years of overconsumption there was a period of severe hyperinflation, making a $10 million note a necessity. This is not without historical precedent‚Äî<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_Zimbabwe">Earth‚Äôs most extreme example of hyperinflation</a> occurred in Zimbabwe in November 2008, just a few months after <em>WALL¬∑E</em>‚Äôs release, when the inflation rate for the Zimbabwe dollar reached a staggering 79,600,000,000 percent per month. At this point, a single US dollar was equivalent to 2,621,984,228 Zimbabwe dollars.&nbsp;The largest-denomination note printed during this time was the $100 trillion note, which makes Buy n Large‚Äôs $10 million bill seem like small change by comparison.</p>

<p>WALL¬∑E leaves the bank behind and continues his journey via the disused tracks of the BnL Transit monorail system. In the absence of working trains, these concrete tracks provide a convenient route through the middle of the deserted city.</p>
<figure data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_1506" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1506"><a href="https://typesetinthefuture.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/walle_0_04_12_full.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://typesetinthefuture.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/walle_0_04_12.jpg?w=1000" alt="walle_0_04_12" srcset="https://typesetinthefuture.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/walle_0_04_12.jpg 560w, https://typesetinthefuture.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/walle_0_04_12.jpg?w=150&amp;h=62 150w, https://typesetinthefuture.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/walle_0_04_12.jpg?w=300&amp;h=125 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1506">WALL¬∑E climbs an escalator&nbsp;to a BnL Transit monorail station.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Despite their association with aspirational futures, monorails have been failing to become a global mass-transit system for almost two hundred years. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_monorail">The first passenger monorail</a> opened in 1825 in Cheshunt, England, primarily to transport bricks, though it was also utilized for transporting people, mostly for novelty purposes. Unlike the top-of-rail system seen in <em>WALL¬∑E</em>, Cheshunt‚Äôs monorail consisted of carriages suspended beneath an overhead track, and was powered by a single horse.</p>
<p>The Cheshunt style of monorail‚Äîwith suspended carriages hanging beneath a single rail‚Äîwas also adopted by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuppertal_Suspension_Railway">Wuppertal Schwebebahn</a>, which began operation along the Wupper River in Wuppertal, Germany, in 1901. The Wuppertal‚Äôs suspended system is still in operation today, carrying more than sixty-five thousand passengers on an average weekday.</p>

<p>The monorail seen in <em>WALL¬∑E</em> is of the style popularized by Swedish entrepreneur <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axel_Wenner-Gren">Axel Wenner-Gren</a>, whose prototype ALWEG (<strong>A</strong>xel <strong>L</strong>ennart <strong>We</strong>nner-<strong>G</strong>ren) monorail system came to the attention of Walt Disney after a family visit to Wuppertal gave him monorail fever. Disney saw the potential for a monorail attraction at his new Disneyland theme park in California, and the Disneyland-ALWEG Monorail System opened in June 1959. The system remains in operation today (under the name Disneyland Monorail), and there are similar attractions at Disneyland Tokyo and Walt Disney World in Florida. In total, Disney monorails have transported more than one billion passengers into an aspirational transportational future.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs not entirely clear what US city WALL¬∑E lives in, but the presence of a monorail network certainly positions it as a location that was once optimistic about the future. This mid-century futurism is borne out by other architectural features of the city, most notably a curved building seen among the billboards encountered earlier. This building is strongly reminiscent of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Needle">Space Needle observation tower</a> in Seattle, Washington, which was built for the city‚Äôs <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Century_21_Exposition">1962 World‚Äôs Fair</a>, together with an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Center_Monorail">ALWEG monorail system</a> that is still in operation today.</p>

<p>Near the monorail, WALL¬∑E passes a promotional poster for himself, with the caption ‚ÄúWorking to dig you out!‚Äù This poster has definite communist propaganda undertones, showing a stylized army of WALL¬∑Es working together to build a brighter future. The implication of this design choice‚Äîthat communist values are the solution to decades of rampant consumerism‚Äîis a pretty bold political statement for what is only the fourth minute of the movie.</p>

<p>Indeed, this gaze is&nbsp;<em>such</em> a common trope that it became the primary styling of the promotional poster for 2014‚Äôs banned comedy movie <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Interview"><em>The Interview</em></a>, in which two Americans travel to North Korea to interview the country‚Äôs leader, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Jong-un">Kim Jong-un</a>. (The <em>WALL¬∑E</em> poster‚Äôs bottom-edge caption, punctuated by an exclamation mark, is a recurring design feature in North Korean propaganda posters.)</p>

<p>This aspirational style is an example of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_realism">socialist realist design</a>, the officially sanctioned visual aesthetic of the Soviet Union, which positioned broad-shouldered, purposeful workers as the true heroes of the age. As a robot who is literally a rectangle, there is surely no worker more broad-shouldered and purposeful than our movie‚Äôs eponymous hero, WALL¬∑E.</p>
<p>WALL¬∑E‚Äôs self-promotional poster is also a fine example of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handel_Gothic">Handel Gothic</a>, one of the movie‚Äôs supporting typefaces. Originally designed in 1965 by Donald J. Handel, the font has become a mainstay of design futurism. (Indeed, it is quite possibly the originator of one of our <a href="https://typesetinthefuture.com/2016/02/18/futuristic/">rules for futuristic type</a>: Make straight things curved.)</p>

<p>My favorite use of the typeface in <em>WALL¬∑E</em> occurs later in the movie, when we see the distinctly curved E of some Handel Gothic‚Ä¶ on a handle. (I refuse to believe this is anything but a deliberate typographic joke.)</p>

<p>Handel Gothic enjoyed a particular resurgence when the type family was expanded in the 1980s, and will be immediately familiar to anyone who visited <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epcot">EPCOT Center</a> at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Disney_World">Walt Disney World</a> in Florida, which opened in 1982. (Later in this article, we‚Äôll look in detail at the theme park, which is now named simply Epcot.) The original EPCOT Center logo was Handel Gothic all the way, making particularly good use of a lowercase n in ‚ÄúCenter‚Äù to bring some extra curviness, and choosing a font variant with a curved leg in its R for consistency. (It also added <a href="https://typesetinthefuture.com/2016/02/18/futuristic/">letter joining and slicing</a> for good futuristic measure.)</p>

<p>The movie that made Handel Gothic synonymous with sci-fi, however, was almost certainly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Spielberg">Steven Spielberg</a>‚Äôs <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_Encounters_of_the_Third_Kind"><em>Close Encounters of the Third Kind</em></a>, released in 1977. <em>Close Encounters</em> used the typeface for its theatrical poster and for its opening credits, with the very words ‚ÄúClose Encounters‚Äù offering not one but three opportunities to recognize Handel Gothic‚Äôs trademark E.</p>

<p>But back to WALL¬∑E‚Äôs journey. Toward the end of his trek home, he passes many more WALL¬∑E units, all of them rusted and dead. The sole remaining WALL¬∑E happily cannibalizes a Caterpillar track from a nearby broken unit to replace his own damaged part, and motors onward with the new track in place.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs an easy detail to miss, but WALL¬∑E‚Äôs home is a broken-down ‚ÄúBnL WALL¬∑E Transport‚Äù vehicle, which may once have housed all the dead units he just passed. When he reverses himself into a WALL¬∑E-size bin in a rotatable storage rack a few minutes later and rocks himself to sleep, his loneliness as the last robot on Earth is made all the more acute by the uninhabited bins around him, now filled with ordered trash.</p>

<p>WALL¬∑E watches his <em>Hello, Dolly!</em> cassette via a small, portable device that looks almost exactly like an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod_Classic#5th_generation">Apple iPod Video</a>. I say ‚Äúalmost,‚Äù because the real-world iPod Video had a smaller click wheel than the one seen in <em>WALL¬∑E</em>, had white labels on its buttons, and did not support external playback from a VHS cassette player. Nonetheless, this iPod is just one example of many in WALL¬∑E‚Äôs home that evoke nostalgia for gadgets past, reinforcing that WALL¬∑E himself is the discarded, unwanted technology that humanity left behind.</p>

<p>WALL¬∑E awakes from robotic sleep on day two of the movie, low on power and dynamism. The fact that his head is a big pair of binoculars gives a great opportunity for a visual gag, as we see him literally bleary-eyed before activating the zoom lock on first his left eye, then his right, to reveal an eye-test chart in the opposing rack.</p>

<p>WALL¬∑E‚Äôs binocular form is mimicked in the shape of his heads-up display (or HUD), which has the classic ‚Äútwo circles‚Äù shape used in many movies to indicate that we are looking from a character‚Äôs viewpoint through a pair of binoculars. This HUD raises an interesting question, however. Why does WALL¬∑E have a heads-up display, with information overlaid on a video stream? A heads-up display really makes sense only if you are a human who has eyes; for a robot, any video input is combined with additional metadata from environmental sensors (such as direction, zoom, and power), and fed directly into the robot‚Äôs processor. Overlaying environmental information on a video stream implies that the robot has cameras that look at the world, and then <em>more</em> cameras that look at the augmented output of those cameras, which doesn‚Äôt make sense at all.</p>
<p>The answer, of course, is that WALL¬∑E has a HUD because movie robots have HUDs, and movie robots have HUDs because they enable the viewer to visualize what the robots are thinking, even if it makes zero sense in technical reality. This trope began in 1973‚Äôs <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westworld_(film)"><em>Westworld</em></a>, whose final act shows us the world from the vantage point of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yul_Brynner">Yul Brynner</a>‚Äôs gun-slinging robot. Although Brynner‚Äôs HUD is not augmented with data, it is nonetheless <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/how-michael-crichtons-westworld-pioneered-modern-special-effects">the first use of computer-generated imagery in a feature film</a>. Director <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Crichton">Michael Crichton</a> cuts several times from a real-world scene to the robot‚Äôs pixelated version of the same, including a thermal image when Brynner chases his prey in the movie‚Äôs final act.</p>

<p>There is one further question raised by WALL¬∑E‚Äôs binocular HUD.

<p>Day two (and act two) of <em>WALL¬∑E</em> see a Buy n Large scout ship arrive on Earth, disrupting WALL¬∑E‚Äôs routine. Most importantly, it introduces us to EVE, who is everything WALL¬∑E is not. EVE‚Äôs shiny white design is technologically advanced; she‚Äôs the curvy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMac_G4">iMac G4</a> to WALL¬∑E‚Äôs boxy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_128K">Mac 128K</a>. Her design evokes sleek Apple products of the 2000s, with her head, in particular, highly reminiscent of a 2002 iMac G4‚Äôs base. Even her reboot sound is a futuristic take on Apple‚Äôs <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/24/jim-reekes-the-apple-sound-designer-who-created-sosumi.html">famous startup chime</a>, whereas WALL¬∑E‚Äôs post-charge chime is the version Apple introduced in 1998 and <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202768">removed altogether in 2016</a>.</p>

<p>EVE‚Äôs evocation of Apple product design is not entirely coincidental. In a <a href="http://fortune.com/2008/05/12/fortune-apples-ive-helped-design-the-heroine-of-pixars-wall-e/">2008 interview with <em>Fortune</em> magazine</a>, director <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Stanton">Andrew Stanton</a> stated: ‚ÄúI wanted EVE to be high-end technology‚Äîno expense spared‚Äîand I wanted it to be seamless and for the technology to be sort of hidden and subcutaneous. The more I started describing it, the more I realized I was pretty much describing the Apple playbook for design.‚Äù This led to a 2005 call to Steve Jobs‚Äîat that time, both owner of Pixar and CEO of Apple‚Äîwhich in turn led to Apple design head <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jony_Ive">Jony Ive</a> spending a day at the Pixar headquarters in Emeryville, consulting on the EVE prototype. (It is surely entirely coincidental that EVE‚Äôs wireless arms and hands are reminiscent of Apple‚Äôs wireless <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Mouse">Magic Mouse</a>, released the year after <em>WALL¬∑E</em>.)</p>

<p>During a dust storm, WALL¬∑E takes EVE back to the safety of his home, where he presents her with a small multicolored cube. In the three seconds the camera pans away for WALL¬∑E to retrieve <em>Hello, Dolly!</em>, EVE solves the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubik%27s_Cube">Rubik‚Äôs Cube</a> and returns it to her astonished host.</p>
<figure data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_1556" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1556"><a href="https://typesetinthefuture.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/walle_0_25_15_full.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://typesetinthefuture.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/walle_0_25_15.jpg?w=1000" alt="walle_0_25_15" srcset="https://typesetinthefuture.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/walle_0_25_15.jpg 560w, https://typesetinthefuture.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/walle_0_25_15.jpg?w=150&amp;h=62 150w, https://typesetinthefuture.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/walle_0_25_15.jpg?w=300&amp;h=125 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1556">WALL¬∑E presents EVE with a Rubik‚Äôs Cube from his trash collection.</figcaption></figure>
<p>EVE‚Äôs cube-solving time would be impressive for a human; the current world record is 4.22 seconds, <a href="http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2018/5/feliks-zemdegs-achieves-fastest-time-to-solve-a-rubiks-cube-in-4-22-seconds-524695">set by Feliks Zemdegs in May 2018</a>. Sadly, because of the camera pan, we‚Äôll never know if EVE broke the world record for a robot, which currently stands at a mind-boggling 0.637 seconds. This record was set in November 2016 by <a href="http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2017/3/video-robot-breaks-world-record-solving-rubiks-cube-in-0-637-seconds-464392">Sub1 Reloaded</a>, a cube-solving robot built by German engineer Albert Beer. Six high-performance stepper motors turned the cube twenty-one times to complete the task, averaging just 0.03 seconds per rotation.</p>

<p>Spare a thought, then, for poor WALL¬∑E. His surprise at EVE‚Äôs accomplishment is understandable‚Äîhe lacks color vision and has only three digits on each hand, which means that Rubik‚Äôs Cubes are really not his specialty. (There‚Äôs a reason Guinness doesn‚Äôt have a ‚Äúfastest dog‚Äù <a href="http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/search?term=rubik">Rubik‚Äôs Cube category</a>.)</p>
<p>One other point of note: This scene is the only time the color green appears in <em>WALL¬∑E</em> in a scene unrelated to a plant. While this breaks the movie‚Äôs careful color scripting, it‚Äôs worth it for a good gag.</p>
<p>All seems to be going well with WALL¬∑E and EVE‚Äôs introductions, until they are rudely interrupted by EVE‚Äôs spotting a plant that WALL¬∑E has excavated from the trash. She subsumes the plant, as per her ‚Äúdirective,‚Äù and enters hibernation mode. WALL¬∑E‚Äôs attempts to wake her invariably end in comedic pain, though one of them does reveal EVE‚Äôs serial number, 051682, set in Handel Gothic. (I can‚Äôt help but wonder whether someone in Pixar‚Äôs art department was born on May 16, 1982.)</p>

<p>WALL¬∑E gives up on reviving EVE and disconsolately returns to his trash-crushing routine. Shortly afterward, the <em>Axiom</em>‚Äôs scout ship returns to Earth and collects EVE to take her home. Desperate not to lose his new friend, WALL¬∑E hitches a ride on the outside of the scout, causing him grief when the ship blasts through Earth‚Äôs surrounding satellite trash. As the satellites fall away, we see that WALL¬∑E has a Soviet-era <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputnik_1">Sputnik 1</a></em> satellite on his head. This is impressive, especially given that <em>Sputnik 1</em>‚Äîthe first man-made object to orbit Earth‚Äîburned up on reentry to Earth‚Äôs atmosphere in 1958.</p>

<p>Showing recent space technology as trash or as museum pieces positions our personal experiences of space as archaic and quaint in comparison to the <em>Axiom</em>‚Äôs futuristic styling. This further reinforces WALL¬∑E‚Äôs own obsolescence as a discarded piece of technology, and sets us up neatly for a transition to the shiny futurism of the <em>Axiom</em>.</p>
<p>The <em>Axiom</em> paints a vision of the future where every menial task, no matter how small, has a dedicated robot created expressly for the purpose. Like <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em>‚Äôs HAL and <em>Alien</em>‚Äôs MU/TH/UR, all these robots have cute acronyms to make them human-friendly.</p>

<p>The <em>Axiom</em>‚Äôs robots travel around the ship via their own dedicated corridors, separate from the craft‚Äôs passenger areas. These passenger areas are split into three classes‚Äîeconomy, coach, and elite‚Äîeach of which has a distinct architectural style. The classes themselves do not play a functional role in the movie‚Äôs plot, but one has to wonder what they mean for the <em>Axiom</em>‚Äôs society. Are children born into the classes their ancestors originally purchased, as if into some kind of futuristic caste system? Would the <em>Axiom</em> have its own <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanic_(1997_film)"><em>Titanic</em></a> moment if a passenger from economy bumped hover chairs with someone from elite? One thing‚Äôs certain: The styling of each class is extremely useful for helping viewers orient themselves within the ship‚Äôs overall structure as the action moves back and forth along its length.</p>
<p>Our introduction to the passenger area starts with the economy deck, which is compact, angular, and concrete in texture and color. Its palette is deliberately sparse, rarely moving outside the Buy n Large blue, red, and white, and making extensive use of the corporation‚Äôs Futura Extra Bold Oblique.</p>

<p>The deck‚Äôs design is highly reminiscent of the interior of the Contemporary Tower at Walt Disney World <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney%27s_Contemporary_Resort">Contemporary Resort</a>, whose A-frame concrete-and-steel structure was so futuristic when it opened in 1971 that it even had a monorail running through the middle. (As anyone who has stayed at the Contemporary can attest, however, its rates can hardly be considered ‚Äúeconomy.‚Äù)</p>

<p>The coach deck, unlike the economy deck, is curved, eclectic, and spacious, with brightly colored holo-ads scattered everywhere. It mimics Las Vegas‚Äôs Strip in gaudiness and style, with artificial neon colors used extensively and every sign encouraging <em>Axiom</em> passengers to spend more money. (How the ship‚Äôs financial economy continues to function after a seven-hundred-year flight continues to remain a mystery.)</p>

<p>The ceiling of the coach deck is a gigantic animated screen that can switch between day and night, complete with a BnL-branded sun or moon. The ceiling‚Äôs relationship to <em>actual</em> time is somewhat tenuous, as we see when Captain McCrea winds the sky back from 12:30 p.m. to 9:30 a.m. in order to make his morning announcements. In this regard, the ceiling is essentially an amalgam of two Las Vegas landmarks: the painted cloud ceilings of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Forum_Shops_at_Caesars">Forum indoor arcade</a> at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesars_Palace">Caesars Palace</a>, whose lighting <a href="http://www.colorkinetics.com/showcase/installs/Caesars-Palace-Forum-Shops/">ebbs and changes</a> without ever making it nighttime enough for you to want to stop buying things, and the four-block-long overhead screen of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fremont_Street_Experience">Fremont Street Experience</a>‚Äîthe world‚Äôs largest video screen‚Äîwhose 12.5 million LEDs illuminate Vegas partygoers every night. The result is an entirely fake sky for the <em>Axiom</em>‚Äôs population, allowing finely tuned control over their artificial environment.</p>

<p>The coach deck leads to the elite deck, whose styling resembles that of a high-class lido or spa. Despite their very different palettes, the coach and elite decks share a curved, futuristic environmental styling that unifies their overall architecture. <a href="http://www.animationartconservation.com/design-with-a-purpose%2C-an-interview-with-ralph-eggleston.html">According to production designer Ralph Eggleston</a>, the architecture of this shared area is inspired by the work of architect <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago_Calatrava">Santiago Calatrava</a>, whose signature curved supports and arches can be seen throughout both decks‚Äô central concourse.</p>

According to production designer Ralph Eggleston, during the movie‚Äôs production <em>WALL¬∑E</em>‚Äôs design team visited an exhibition of Tomorrowland concept art and took inspiration from the designs therein.&nbsp;Perhaps the most obvious of these influences is the presence of a PeopleMover transportation system running through the middle of the club and elite decks, in a style very similar to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PeopleMover">PeopleMover</a> at Tomorrowland.

<p>The evolution of Disney‚Äôs PeopleMover concept began with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1964_New_York_World%27s_Fair">1964‚Äì65 New York World‚Äôs Fair</a>, for which the Ford Motor Company asked Disney to <a href="https://www.thehenryford.org/collections-and-research/digital-collections/artifact/67807/#slide=gs-292282">design an attraction</a> to compete with General Motors‚Äô <a href="http://www.nywf64.com/gm06.shtml">Futurama II</a> exhibit. The resulting <a href="https://www.waltdisney.org/blog/beyond-magic-skyway">Magic Skyway</a> gave fairgoers an opportunity to ride in a <a href="https://www.thehenryford.org/collections-and-research/digital-collections/artifact/361330/">driverless Ford convertible</a>‚Äîincluding the just-launched Ford Mustang‚Äîthrough a diorama that transported them from prehistoric times to a futuristic space city.</p>
<p>Following its success at the World‚Äôs Fair, the traction system behind Magic Skyway was adapted into a new feature for Tomorrowland‚Äôs 1967 relaunch. The new attraction, known as the WEDway PeopleMover, enabled <strong>W</strong>alter <strong>E</strong>lias <strong>D</strong>isney to follow Axel Lennart Wenner-Gren (of ALWEG monorail fame) in naming a futuristic transportation mechanism with his initials. It also provided an ideal inspiration for the <em>Axiom</em>‚Äôs central transport system.</p>
<p>The <em>Axiom</em>‚Äôs PeopleMover has much in common with its WEDway counterpart. Both are focused on a main circular loading area in the heart of a central plaza, with a long, straight stretch of track extending away from the loading deck. Both give passengers a tantalizing view of surrounding attractions as they are transported from one area to another. Indeed, I am sure Walt Disney would have been delighted to see his dream of future transportation integrated into the <em>Axiom</em>‚Äôs space-age environment, especially given that Disneyland‚Äôs PeopleMover was a prototype for Walt‚Äôs grander vision of futuristic living. Walt planned to build a larger PeopleMover installation as part of his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPCOT_(concept)">Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow</a>, or EPCOT‚Äîa new and futuristic city to be created from scratch at his planned Disney World Resort in Florida.</p>
<p>In October 1966, Walt recorded <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/theoriginalepcot/film-transcript">a short film</a> pitching his ‚ÄúFlorida Project‚Äù to industrialists and legislators, including a detailed description of EPCOT‚Äôs transportation system. In this new city, cars and trucks were to be pushed underground, with the community‚Äôs twenty thousand residents instead traveling by WEDway and monorail to work, play, and socialize. The concept images below from Walt‚Äôs EPCOT film give an idea of just how much imagination the creative brains at WED Enterprises applied, under Walt‚Äôs careful guidance, to everyday living challenges.</p>

<p>Tragically, Walt Disney died less than two months after his EPCOT introduction was filmed, passing away before the pitch was screened and before New Tomorrowland opened to the public. His ambitious vision of a prototype community did not become a reality, but its name lives on in the Epcot theme park (formerly ‚ÄúEPCOT Center‚Äù) at Walt Disney World in Florida‚Äîalthough the eventual EPCOT park became more of a permanent World‚Äôs Fair than a real-life city of the future. The WEDway PeopleMover did not realize its potential, either: The Disneyland attraction closed in 1995, to be replaced by the faster (but short-lived) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_Rods">Rocket Rods</a> ride, which itself closed in 2001.</p>
<p>Disneyland park-goers can still see the PeopleMover‚Äôs abandoned tracks snaking through Tomorrowland, displaying curved, arched supports that Santiago Calatrava would surely approve of. (Thankfully, a PeopleMover can still be experienced at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Kingdom">Magic Kingdom park</a> at the Walt Disney World Resort in Florida, where the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomorrowland_Transit_Authority_PeopleMover">Tomorrowland Transit Authority PeopleMover</a> continues to provide a leisurely tour of nearby attractions.)</p>

<p>Of course, the PeopleMover also lives on via the <em>Axiom</em>, whose reimagining of the concept is almost a microcosm of Walt‚Äôs vision for EPCOT. Aboard the <em>Axiom</em>, it‚Äôs a PeopleMover (not a monorail) that fulfills the role of high-speed arterial transport, with individual BnL hover chairs completing the ‚Äúfinal mile‚Äù of the journey via preset illuminated paths (blue for humans, white for robots, red for stewardbots). It may not match the scale of Disney‚Äôs EPCOT dream, but it‚Äôs nonetheless fitting that Walt‚Äôs vision of a transportational future made the trip into space.</p>

<p>During WALL¬∑E‚Äôs tour of the passenger decks, we discover that the <em>Axiom</em>‚Äôs computer is voiced by none other than <em>Alien</em>‚Äôs Ellen Ripley.

(Weaver also plays a disembodied voice in Andrew Stanton‚Äôs <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finding_Dory"><em>Finding Dory</em></a>, aping her narration of nature documentaries.)</p>

<p><em>Alien</em> and <em>Aliens</em> are not the only sci-fi movies to get a nod from <em>WALL¬∑E</em>. On the <em>Axiom</em> bridge, we meet AUTO, the ship‚Äôs autopilot robot.

His design is clearly influenced by a certain other ESBC‚Äîthat central red eye is a direct reference to <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em>‚Äôs HAL, giving an immediate signal that this robot is not to be trusted.</p>

<p>AUTO‚Äôs physical similarity to HAL gives him a practical similarity, too. On the rare occasions we see the world from AUTO‚Äôs vantage point, we get an extreme fish-eye view of the surrounding area, just as we did for HAL in <em>2001</em>. WALL¬∑E combines HAL‚Äôs fish-eye view with <em>The Terminator</em>‚Äôs red HUD hue, making AUTO‚Äôs evil intent doubly clear to any discerning fan of sci-fi.</p>

<p>That red glow has its benefits, however.

<p>AUTO may look like the movie‚Äôs bad guy, but his actions are simply an example of artificial intelligence following its programming too literally. To understand his motives, we must remember that BnL‚Äôs original plan was for its star liners to return to Earth as soon as an EVE probe found proof that life was once more sustainable. Five years after their departure, however, BnL autopilots were sent a directive by CEO Shelby Forthright telling them to keep their craft in space indefinitely, because the cleanup process on Earth was not going to succeed. Six hundred and ninety-five years later, with no subsequent instructions to the contrary, AUTO is simply following this command to the letter, blocking any and all attempts to return to Earth.</p>
<p>In this regard, AUTO is eerily similar to <em>2001</em>‚Äôs HAL, whose murderous tendencies aboard the <em>Discovery</em> were similarly driven by an inability to reconcile a contradiction in his programming. In the movie‚Äôs sequel, <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010:_The_Year_We_Make_Contact">2010: The Year We Make Contact</a></em>, we learn that the basic purpose of HAL‚Äôs design was ‚Äúthe accurate processing of information without distortion or concealment.‚Äù We also discover that HAL was instructed (via Directive NSD 342/23) to lie to Dave and Frank about the real reason for the <em>Discovery</em>‚Äôs mission. After lip-reading that they planned to disconnect him, HAL determined that the only logical way for him to both keep processing and avoid lying was for Dave and Frank to die.</p>
<p>AUTO‚Äôs own instruction is Directive A113, whose numbering may sound familiar to Pixar fans. ‚Äú<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A113">A113</a>‚Äù appears in every Pixar film, from a family license plate in <em>Toy Story</em> to an underwater camera model in <em>Finding Nemo</em>. (Indeed, it‚Äôs even in <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brave_(2012_film)">Brave</a></em>, where the roman numerals ACXIII appear carved just above the front door of a witch‚Äôs hut.) The reason for its repeated inclusion is that room A1-13 was the classroom for the <a href="https://filmvideo.calarts.edu/programs/character-animation">Character Animation Program</a> at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Institute_of_the_Arts">California Institute of the Arts</a>, where Pixar alumni <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lasseter">John Lasseter</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Docter">Pete Docter</a>, and Andrew Stanton studied. (This explains why it‚Äôs also the number on the door of Riley‚Äôs classroom in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inside_Out_(2015_film)"><em>Inside Out</em></a>, and on the Scaring 101 classroom door in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsters_University"><em>Monsters University</em></a>.) <em>WALL¬∑E</em> may be its highest-profile outing, but it‚Äôs there in every Pixar movie if you keep your eyes peeled.</p>

<p>The majority of <em>WALL¬∑E</em>‚Äôs robots are voiced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Burtt">Ben Burtt</a>, the Academy Award-winning sound designer and creator of R2D2‚Äôs bleeps. AUTO‚Äôs voice, however, is provided by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlainTalk">MacInTalk</a>, a speech synthesis technology <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B-XwPjn9YY&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=3m10s">first used to announce the Apple Macintosh computer in January 1984</a>.

<p>MacInTalk‚Äôs inclusion in <em>WALL¬∑E</em> makes it one of only two Apple voice synthesis technologies to star in a feature film; the other is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siri">Siri</a>, who provides the voice for ‚ÄôPuter, Batman‚Äôs high-tech assistant in <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lego_Batman_Movie">The LEGO Batman Movie</a></em>.</p>

<p>Despite the technology‚Äôs age, I‚Äôm happy to report that MacInTalk voices still ship with macOS today.

<p>In addition to AUTO, there are two more nods to <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em> in <em>WALL¬∑E</em>, both of which take advantage of preexisting associations for dramatic or comedic effect. The first is WALL¬∑E‚Äôs brief escapade in a LifePod, the design of which seems clearly inspired by <em>2001</em>‚Äôs EVA pods. That iconic ball-like shape immediately triggers an association with interstellar peril, which WALL¬∑E soon discovers is entirely justified.</p>

It is similarly parodied in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_and_the_Chocolate_Factory_(film)"><em>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</em></a> (as a <em>2001</em> monolith turns into a bar of chocolate) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoolander"><em>Zoolander</em></a> (as Hansel considers smashing Mugatu‚Äôs iMac with a nearby bone). If that‚Äôs not enough, it‚Äôs also in Pixar‚Äôs <em>Toy Story 2</em> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cars_3"><em>Cars 3</em></a>, plus other animated movies including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kung_Fu_Panda_3"><em>Kung Fu Panda 3</em></a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pirates!_In_an_Adventure_with_Scientists!"><em>The Pirates!

<p>Once again, <em>WALL¬∑E</em> is sneakily using prior sci-fi art as a shortcut, re-creating familiar effects so that the <em>Axiom</em>‚Äôs quick journey home can be explained without exposition.

<p>As these homages show, <em>WALL¬∑E</em> is not afraid to borrow from its predecessors to gain some free sci-fi association. Indeed, such references are celebrated and elevated, drawing on the production team‚Äôs clear fondness for vintage sci-fi to create a movie that is both a love letter to the classics and a worthy addition to the list. <em>WALL¬∑E</em> capitalizes on our existing associations with the future to communicate complex plot points and motives with minimal dialogue and text. It is, to my mind, Pixar‚Äôs most realistic vision of an internally consistent world, despite the polar opposites of its Earth- and space-based environments. It‚Äôs political and satirical, representing utopia and dystopia with enough humor to poke fun at the downsides of both. In short, <em>WALL¬∑E</em> envisages a future that could so easily be bleak and pessimistic‚Äîbut is instead inspired by the na√Øvet√© of its inhuman heroes to re-create the optimism that took man into space in the first place.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"><span>A global internet sweep that examined the websites and mobile apps of 642 traders has found that <strong>75,7% of them employed at least one dark pattern, and 66,8% of them employed two or more dark patterns</strong>.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"><span>Dark patterns are defined as practices commonly found in online user interfaces and that steer, deceive, coerce, or manipulate consumers into making choices that often are not in their best interests. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"><span>This year‚Äôs annual International Consumer Protection and Enforcement Network (ICPEN) Sweep took place between January 29 and February 2, 2024. It involved participants, or ‚Äúsweepers,‚Äù from 27 consumer protection enforcement authorities in 26 countries around the world.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"><span>For the first time, the ICPEN sweep was coordinated with the Global Privacy Enforcement Network (GPEN). GPEN is a network of over 80 privacy enforcement authorities, which aims to foster cross-border cooperation across privacy regulators and strengthen personal privacy protections in an increasingly global market. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"><span>The collaboration recognizes the growing intersection between consumer protection and other regulatory spheres. In the case of deceptive design patterns, it was clear to both privacy and consumer protection sweepers that many websites and apps employ techniques that interfere with individuals‚Äô ability to make choices that best protect their consumer or privacy rights.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"><span>Sweepers evaluated the sites and apps based on six indicators identified by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), as being characteristic of dark commercial patterns&nbsp;<a href="#_ftn1"><span><span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"><span><span>[1]</span></span></span></span></span></a>. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"><span>The ICPEN report found that potential <strong>sneaking</strong> practices, such as the inability of the consumer to turn off auto-renewal of subscription service, and <strong>interface interference</strong>, for example making a subscription that is advantageous to the trader more prominent, were encountered especially frequent during the sweep. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"><span>Both ICPEN and GPEN, who are working together to improve consumer and privacy protection for individuals around the world, published reports outlining their findings today. The ICPEN report can be found <a href="https://icpen.org/sites/default/files/2024-07/Public%20Report%20ICPEN%20Dark%20Patterns%20Sweep.pdf">here</a> and GPEN report can be found on their <a href="https://www.privacyenforcement.net/content/2024-gpen-sweep-deceptive-design-patterns">website</a>. </span></span></span></span></p>
