	<div>
		<p>There are time when being a semiconductor CEO is rather easy. Just consider Brian Krzanich: when he took over the Intel job in 2013, I wrote in <a href="https://stratechery.com/2013/the-intel-opportunity/">The Intel Opportunity</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  A new CEO has taken over Intel. Their core business, upon which the company has been built, is floundering. Does the new CEO, who is not really new at all (he’s the current COO), have the vision to ensure Intel’s continued success? I’m not talking about Brian Krzanich, who today was promoted from COO to CEO at Intel. Rather, I’m talking about Andy Grove, who took over Intel in 1987.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The crisis Grove encountered was Intel’s floundering memory business; <a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/andy-grove-and-the-iphone-se/">he exited memory and focused on logic chips</a>, and the rest was history. I thought that Krzanich should do something similar: Intel should stop focusing its efforts on being an integrated device manufacturer (IDM) — a company that both designed and manufactured its own chips exclusively — and shift to becoming a foundry that also served external customers. Back to the Article:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Today Intel has once again promoted a COO to CEO. And today, once again, Intel is increasingly under duress. And, once again, the only way out may require a remaking of their identity. It is into a climate of doom and gloom that Krzanich is taking over as CEO. And, in what will be a highly emotional yet increasingly obvious decision, he ought to commit Intel to the chip manufacturing business, i.e. manufacturing chips according to other companies’ designs.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Krzanich did not take my advice, and this is what happened to Intel’s stock during his tenure:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/intel-humbling-1.png?resize=640%2C331&amp;ssl=1" alt="Intel's stock under Brian Krzanich" width="640" height="331" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/intel-humbling-1.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/intel-humbling-1.png?resize=300%2C155&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/intel-humbling-1.png?resize=1024%2C529&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/intel-humbling-1.png?resize=768%2C397&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/intel-humbling-1.png?resize=1200%2C620&amp;ssl=1 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>The thing is, if you don’t invest in the future, or see fundamental changes in the market coming, then you don’t have to spend as much; if you don’t have to spend as much then you can increase margins. And, while there were some analysts that could foresee the extent to which fabs were dramatically increasing in price, and would thus need to significantly increase volume to maintain profitability in the long run, this was clearly a case where Wall Street mostly cared about the forecast for the next quarter or the next year.</p>
<p>All of this was compounded by the assumption that Intel would stay in the process lead forever; indeed, while I was right about the changing costs of foundries and the need for Intel to open up to outside customers, in 2013 I didn’t forecast Intel losing their process leadership. That happened under Krzanich too: TSMC started manufacturing 7nm in volume in early 2017, and Intel announced a delay in 10nm (which was roughly equivalent to TSMC’s 7nm) in April 2018. And yet the stock went up, faster than ever.</p>
<h3>Intel’s Struggles</h3>
<p>Later that year Krzanich was fired for having <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/21/intel-ceo-brian-krzanich-to-step-down-bob-swan-to-step-in-as-interim-ceo.html">a relationship with an Intel employee</a>; Bob Swan stepped into the CEO role, but it was ultimately current CEO Pat Gelsinger that is paying the price for Krzanich’s lack of strategic foresight and total fumble in terms of execution. Consider the company’s earnings announcement last week; from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-25/intel-gives-bleak-forecast-in-sign-comeback-is-going-slowly">Bloomberg</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Intel Corp. tumbled the most in more than three years after delivering a disappointing forecast, a reaction that Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger said Friday was overblown. The shares fell 12% to $43.65 in New York after Intel’s first-quarter projection for both sales and profit came in well short of Wall Street estimates. It was the biggest single-day decline since July 2020.</p>
<p>  The outlook sparked fears that Gelsinger’s long-promised comeback bid has gotten off track. Though the chipmaker’s personal computer business is recovering, demand is weakening in the lucrative market for data center processors. Intel also is contending with a slowdown in programmable chips and components for self-driving vehicles, and a fledgling business that makes semiconductors for other companies hasn’t yet taken off…</p>
<p>  During a conference call with analysts, Gelsinger acknowledged that the first quarter wasn’t going as well as hoped, but that he expected the rest of 2024 to improve quarter by quarter. Intel’s efforts to return to the cutting edge of manufacturing are still on track, he said. That’s crucial to improving its products and staying competitive. He also asserted that the chipmaker is no longer losing sales to competitors in PCs and data centers.
</p></blockquote>
<p>This stock price decline was just one of many under Gelsinger’s leadership:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/intel-humbling-2.png?resize=640%2C310&amp;ssl=1" alt="Intel's stock under Pat Gelsinger" width="640" height="310" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/intel-humbling-2.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/intel-humbling-2.png?resize=300%2C145&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/intel-humbling-2.png?resize=1024%2C496&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/intel-humbling-2.png?resize=768%2C372&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/intel-humbling-2.png?resize=1200%2C581&amp;ssl=1 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>This past quarter continues many of the trends driving this multi-year decline: client PCs are finally making a comeback from the COVID hangover, but many of Intel’s non-CPU businesses are struggling and/or facing inventory corrections, including MobileEye, networking, and FPGAs. The biggest problem, though, continues to be the data center: AMD makes better CPUs on a better process (TSMC’s) and they continue to eat Intel’s lunch amongst the biggest cloud providers who, because they buy the most CPUs, are willing to do the work necessary to make the best performing chip work (this is why Intel’s on-premise and government business has long held up better). That direct competition is compounded by the secular pressure from ARM on one side and the diversion of spend to GPUs (primarily Nvidia, but also AMD) on the other.</p>
<h3>Intel’s Progress</h3>
<p>This is where being a semiconductor CEO is very difficult. Over the last few years Gelsinger has done exactly what needed to be done a decade earlier: he is <a href="https://stratechery.com/2021/intel-unleashed-gelsinger-on-intel-idm-2-0/">transforming Intel into a foundry</a> that serves external customers, and he is working to at least make Intel competitive again on the leading edge, and maybe even take the lead in a few years, if you believe Intel’s claims about its 18A process.</p>
<p>18A is the fifth of the fabled “five nodes in four years” that Gelsinger promised shortly after he took over, and it appears that he is pulling it off. Gelsinger summarized those five nodes in a <a href="https://stratechery.com/2023/an-interview-with-intel-ceo-pat-gelsinger-about-intels-progress-towards-process-leadership/">Stratechery Interview</a> last fall:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  So Intel 7 is the last of the pre-EUV technologies. Intel 4, the first EUV technology for us, Intel 3 refined the final FinFET, really helped us take those learnings, but largely was a common architecture of transistor and process flow — really just the refinement. Much like you say, TSMC and others have done, get the initial one working and then refine it for scale manufacturing, that’s Intel 3. And given it’s the second generation of that, we’ll be applying that to our big server products, Granite Rapids, Sierra Forest, big die. We need to get down the learning curve with Meteor Lake, our first client partner. And then now with the big server die, and that’s also what we’re introducing on Intel 4, more so on Intel 3, a lot of the advanced packaging technologies come big into the technology footprint. Then the new transistor, the new backside power begins with 20A, and for that Arrow Lake is sort of the first, get it up and running small die, something easier to design and then when we get to 18A, the journey is done.

<p>The TSMC equivalents are a bit fuzzy, particularly once you get into the future; TSMC CEO C.C. Wei has been adamant on the last couple of TSMC earnings calls that TSMC’s advanced 3nm process will outperform Intel’s 18A (Intel’s argument is that backside power will make chips much easier to design, since the power is separated from the communications layer, eliminating interference). What’s important, though, is that that is a question worth answering. Gelsinger said of 18A, which is the process that Intel is pushing hard to potential foundry customers, <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4665168-intel-corporation-intc-q4-2023-earnings-call-transcript">on the company’s earnings call</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  We are first in the industry to have incorporated both gate-all-around and backside power delivery in a single process node, the latter unexpected two years ahead of our competition. Arrow Lake, our lead Intel 20A vehicle will launch this year. Intel 18A is expected to achieve manufacturing readiness in second half ’24, completing our five nodes in four year journey and bringing us back to process leadership. I am pleased to say that Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A part for servers has already gone into fab and Panther Lake for clients will be heading into Fab shortly…</p>
<p>  Our success with IFS will be measured by customer commitments and revenue. We have taped out more than 75 ecosystem and customer test chips. IFS already has more than 50 test chips in the pipeline across 2024 and 2025, 75% of which are on Intel 18A. During CES, we welcomed the Valens Semiconductor to the growing list of foundry customers as they announced they would use IFS to fabricate their MIPI A-PHY chipsets using our advanced technology. In addition to the 3 Intel 18A customers we disclosed in Q3, we won a key design win with a significant high-performance computing customer. This customer was particularly motivated by our unique leading-edge manufacturing capabilities and U.S. capacity. We came into 2023 committing to one 18A foundry customer. We executed on four inclusive of a meaningful prepay and our momentum continues to grow.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The ultimate proof point for Gelsinger’s strategy will be chips designed by external customers, fabbed on Intel’s 18A process, running in devices in people’s pockets; nothing is assured until then. That, unfortunately, is the rub: there is no revenue until then either, and “then” is still a few years into the future. One wonders if Gelsinger will be there to enjoy the uplift that would only then be justified, at least from the perspective of Wall Street.</p>
<p>From my perspective — which, as exemplified by my disappointment with Krzanich despite Intel’s great stock returns during his tenure, is absolutely not stock-picking advice — he very much deserves the chance. Intel has the right strategy and seems to be executing; the challenge is that semiconductor cycles operate in something closer to decades than years, much less quarters.</p>
<h3>Intel’s New Partner</h3>
<p>So what does Intel do in the meantime? Last week also brought news of a very interesting new partnership that helps answer that question. From <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Tech/Semiconductors/Intel-partners-with-Taiwan-s-No.-2-chipmaker-UMC-in-Arizona">Nikkei</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Intel and Taiwan’s United Microelectronics Corp. (UMC) on Thursday announced a partnership that will lead to production in the U.S. state of Arizona by 2027, part of the American semiconductor company’s push to expand its business of making chips for others. The partners will develop relatively mature 12-nanometer technology, ideal in building chips for Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, microcontrollers, sensors and a range of other connectivity applications, but not for cutting-edge central processing units or graphics processors. Intel said the long-term agreement can leverage its U.S. manufacturing capacity and UMC’s extensive foundry experience in mature chip production technologies that serve a wide range of chip developers.</p>
<p>  Based in the Taiwanese city of Hsinchu, UMC is a smaller peer of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world’s biggest contract chipmaker or foundry. UMC is the world’s third-largest contract chipmaker.
</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://stratechery.com/2024/tsmc-earnings-the-trailing-node-netflix-wwe-follow-up/">Last week I wrote about TSMC’s earnings</a> and explained how TSMC has been forced to increasingly adopt the old Intel model, first in pricing, and then in its equipment usage:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The leading edge costs a lot of money to ramp up — N3 is lowering margins for now, as every new node does its first few years — but those costs are made up for by the ability to charge much higher prices. To that end N3 is already up to 15% of TSMC revenue, followed by 35% at N5, and 17% at N7.</p>
<p>  This reality is not new for TSMC, but it is different than how the company has operated historically. TSMC started out as a foundry selling trailing edge chips; the primary way of making money over the long run was to build a fab relatively cheaply using established equipment, and then run that fab for many years. Once all of the equipment was depreciated, every chip produced was almost pure profit, even if the revenue on a per-chip basis was fairly low.</p>
<p>  It was Intel, on the other hand, that charged the highest prices for the fastest chips, and all of its business was on the leading edge, selling its own chips; that meant that the company would take down old fabs and repurpose as much equipment as it could for the next node, instead of running the fab forever like a foundry would (this is one of Intel’s challenges in becoming a foundry: they simply don’t have much depreciated trailing edge capacity throwing off cash).</p>
<p>  What is interesting to note is that TSMC’s shift to a more Intel-like model in terms of its revenue drivers (leading edge) and profit drivers (high prices) is starting to impact how they manage their fabs. CFO Wendell Huang said <a href="https://investor.tsmc.com/chinese/encrypt/files/encrypt_file/reports/2024-01/77f58cc7cac9df532c274f893b1c722de15c3f85/TSMC%204Q23%20Transcript.pdf">in his prepared remarks</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
    In addition, we have a strategy so that some of our N3 capacity can be supported by N5 tools given the strong multiyear demand. Such a plan will enable higher capital efficiency in the mid to long term, but requires cost and effort in the near term. Most of this conversion will occur in second half of 2024, and we expect it to dilute our gross margin by about 1 to 2 percentage points in second half of 2024.
  </p></blockquote>
<p>  Notice what is happening here: TSMC, unlike its historical pattern, is not keeping (all of its) 5nm capacity to make low-cost high-margin chips in fully-depreciated fabs; rather, it is going to repurpose some amount of equipment — probably as much as it can manage — to 3nm, which will allow it to expand its capacity without a commensurate increase in capital costs. This will both increase the profitability of 3nm and also recognizes the reality that is afflicting TSMC’s 7nm node: there is an increasingly large gap between the leading edge and “good enough” nodes for the vast majority of use cases.
</p></blockquote>
<p>This Intel-UMC deal represents the inverse of what is happening at TSMC: a viable foundry business can’t just rely on selling leading-edge chips at very high margins — particularly since Intel’s claims that it will regain process leadership remain to be seen. What is critical is having fully depreciated foundries still making chips: yes, those chips cost a lot less than the leading edge, but given that the marginal costs are practically zero (at least relative to the fixed costs) they are an important source of cash flow and profits, which can be re-invested in the leading edge. This deal is about capturing that depreciated cash flow.</p>
<h3>Intel’s Needs</h3>
<p>Intel, however, as I noted, only ever needed leading edge fabs — no one wants an old Intel chip when newer and faster ones are on the market. This was a big reason, of course, why Krzanich so badly missed The Intel Opportunity: in 2012 Intel was right in the middle of the FinFET-deep ultraviolet (DUV) lithography era of chip fabrication, but the end of both was already on the horizon in the form of RibbonFET (i.e. Gate-All-Around transistors) and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography. Given the astronomical costs of EUV in particular it would have been reasonable to forecast then that there might develop a sweet spot making FinFET transistors with DUV, but Intel missed out on a decade of building up the capability to serve external customers.</p>
<p>This capability — or the lack thereof — remains one of the biggest questions around Intel’s foundry efforts. In 2022, when Intel tried to buy Tower Semiconductor, I wrote <a href="https://stratechery.com/2022/pelotons-operations-intel-buys-tower-semiconductor-what-now-for-arm-plus-intel-risc-v/">in an Update</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  It is not only the case that Intel primarily makes its own designs, it also makes only digital chips (i.e. everything is a 1 or a 0). However, there is also an entire universe of analog chips, which can process gradations; this is essential for processing data from the physical world like sound, power, light, etc. Tower specializes in a whole host of specialized chips in the analog space; adding Tower’s capabilities to Intel Foundry Services (IFS) will make the latter much more of a true one stop shop for chip fabrication, matching the capabilities of TSMC or GlobalFoundries.</p>
<p>  To me it is the GlobalFoundries angle that is the most interesting here: I have long been a proponent of Intel buying GlobalFoundries, despite the fact that GlobalFoundries isn’t a particularly great business, has given up on the leading edge process race, etc. My thinking has been that Intel can bring the capability (maybe) and willingness to invest in the leading edge, while GlobalFoundries can bring the breadth of capabilities and customer service orientation necessary to be a foundry. Sure, that’s expensive, but allowing IFS to be choked off by Intel’s integrated and not-invented-here culture would be even more expensive.</p>
<p>  I suspect the Tower acquisition firmly closes the door on that possibility (which to be fair, was clearly remote). Here the calculus is much more straightforward: Tower brings certain capabilities and customer relationships that Intel believes it can scale up inside its factory network at a much lower cost than GlobalFoundries (whose current market cap is $29 billion), and it will be much easier to absorb and integrate into Intel’s business. The big question is whether or not integrating into Intel’s business is in fact the entire problem that needs to be avoided.
</p></blockquote>
<p>At Intel, manufacturing has always called the shots. The design side of the company had to accommodate the fabs, whether that be using their archaic design software, working around manufacturing challenges, or figuring out how to make a faster chip on recycled equipment. This made sense for a long time, but there was a cost: Intel designs stopped being innovative and became dependent on Intel’s manufacturing for performance; when Intel’s manufacturing prowess hit a wall Intel’s designs were exposed. Gelsinger told me:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  So all of a sudden, as Warren Buffet says, “You don’t know who’s swimming naked until the tide goes out.” When the tide went out with the process technology, and hey, we were swimming naked, our designs were not competitive. So all of a sudden we realized, “Huh, the rising tide ain’t saving us. We don’t have leadership architecture anymore.” And you saw the exposure.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Indeed, we see the stock price!</p>
<p>That, though, was only part of Intel’s problem: the more fundamental issue is that a foundry is, as I wrote, a customer service organization: an entity like TSMC adapts to customers’ designs, not the other way around. They use industry standard design software. They have extensive libraries of IP that make designing a chip more akin to assembling a collection of Lego blocks. They ship when they say they will ship, and they run the fab for which a chip was designed forever.</p>
<p>Intel did <em>none</em> of these things, and had a mentality and culture that ran in the exact opposite direction: in a foundry, manufacturing is not king but a servant; customer sales is not about “take-it-or-leave-it” but “let us help you solve your problem.” I was — and frankly, remain — dubious about Intel’s ability to create that sort of culture internally, which is why I advocated for an acquisition, first of Global Foundries, and then of Tower. Thanks to its decade delay Intel didn’t have time to learn how to serve customers: it had rapidly obsoleting fabs that needed to be filled as soon as possible, if the company ever had hope of making enough cash to fund its push back to the leading edge.</p>
<p>Unfortunately China blocked the acquisition of Tower, in <a href="https://stratechery.com/2022/china-chip-ban-clarifications-nvidias-a800-china-intel-and-tower/">what I suspect was retaliation for U.S. restrictions on China</a>. Worse, from what I have heard Intel responded by starting to sell a lot of old equipment at rock-bottom prices, which usually ended up in China; the fact of the matter is that the company needs cash.</p>
<h3>Intel’s Humbling</h3>
<p>Perhaps, though, the fire-sale is coming to an end: all of this context explains why this deal exists, and why I think it is a fantastic idea:</p>
<ul>
<li>UMC, like <a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/uber-follow-up-globalfoundries-abandons-7nm-pricing-power-differentiation-and-integration/">GlobalFoundries before it</a>, has struggled to keep pace with ever more expensive fabs. The company has a 14nm offering, but has shown little evidence it can or will go further, and the EUV transition seems completely out of the question. However, UMC does have a large foundry business, which is to say that UMC is a customer service organization, with the compatibility and IP necessary to succeed.</li>
<li>Intel, meanwhile, has a ton of capacity with FinFET and DUV processes. One of the costs of the company’s failure at 10nm and 7nm was that the company built extra 14nm fabs. A huge amount of that equipment, particularly the lithography, is not useful for the leading edge, but it is fully depreciated and could be used to build <em>pretty</em> fast chips for a lot less than the leading edge.</li>
</ul>
<p>This deal —&nbsp;which is for a new, designed-for-external-customers 12nm process — brings together the two company’s core capabilities: UMC is the customer service organization, and Intel is the manufacturer. Yes, that means lower revenue and margins for both, but both have already built the capabilities necessary to make the deal succeed, which means the business should be accretive to both revenue and profits for each of them.</p>
<p>The big question is how big of a market there is for fast-but-not-the-fastest chips: Intel is talking up things like communications chips, image sensing processors, etc., but a new process will require new design wins. Moreover, TSMC is counting on the same market for its 7nm process: that process should be faster, but it is also more difficult to make (7nm requires quad-patterning, while 12nm is dual patterning; this means easier designs, higher throughput, and better yields for the latter).</p>
<p>It is also, one might say, a bit humiliating: mighty Intel, which bestrode the tech industry for 50 years, the keepers of Moore’s Law, is making a deal with a Taiwanese also-ran, because it needs the help. That, though, is no insult: Intel needed some humbling, and this deal, more than any 18A design win or lofty promise about the AI PC, gives me hope that the company is in fact turning things around.</p>

Located in the Caribbean, the country, home to about 15,000 people, has a unique and suddenly in-demand resource.</p><p>In the late 1980s, the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) assigned countries and regions of geographic interest<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-most-remote-island-in-the-world-is-home-to-seals-seabirds-and-an-internet-toplevel-domain" target="_self"> their own two-letter domains</a>. Anguilla received .ai, a luck of the draw that is now paying dividends as the country registers website domains for AI companies. <em><a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/">IEEE Spectrum</a></em>spoke with<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vince_Cate" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> Vince Cate</a>, who manages domain registrations for the Anguillan government, on how AI has had an impact on .ai.</p><div id="rebelltitem1" data-id="1" data-reload-ads="false" data-is-image="False" data-href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-domains/vince-cate" data-basename="vince-cate" data-post-id="2666970260" data-published-at="1705436643" data-use-pagination="False"><h3 data-role="headline">
            
                Vince Cate
            
            
        </h3><p><a href="http://offshore.ai/vince/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Vince Cate</a> is a software developer and the founder of <a href="http://datahaven.net/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">DataHaven.Net</a>, which handles sales of the .ai domain for the Anguillan government.</p></div><p><strong>How did you end up managing the .ai domain?</strong></p><p><strong>Vince Cate: </strong>I came to Anguilla in 1994. I started out doing an email business, because there wasn’t any email or Internet on this island. And I wanted to have a domain name<a href="http://offshore.ai/vince/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> that was .ai</a>. So I reached out to <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/computer-networking" target="_self">Jon Postel</a>—he was the one that was in charge of all these top-level domains. He said, there’s nobody running .ai, do you want to run .ai? And I said, “Okay.” That was really how it went!</p><p>At some point, I said, this shouldn’t be in my name, right? So I changed the [IANA] <a href="https://www.iana.org/domains/root/db/ai.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">admin contact</a> to be the government of Anguilla. Somebody else saw that and convinced the government to give it to them, so it went to this company in Taiwan. After a couple of years, they disappeared. They didn’t answer emails or phone calls or anything. And we got it back. A number of small countries got really messed up by losing their domain names, and I would say we kind of came close.</p><p><strong>How did .ai open up for use outside of Anguilla?</strong></p><p><strong>Cate: </strong>This other company came and convinced the government that they could make a lot of money on it. They had this idea, that in Chinese “ài” means love. They thought they<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanity_domain" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> could market it</a> to [Chinese websites]. At the time, I thought that artificial intelligence was a much better market.</p><p><strong>Has the surge in AI interest been reflected in the number of .ai domains being registered?</strong></p><p><strong>Cate: </strong>November 30 [2022] is when<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/chatbot-chatgpt-interview" target="_self"> ChatGPT came out</a>. In the five months after that, our sales went up by almost a factor of four. Then they sort of leveled off at this new, much higher level. It’s just wild—we’re already like a third of the government’s budget.</p><p><strong>Tuvalu is perhaps the first and most well-known example of a country<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2019/12/23/tuvalu-is-tiny-island-nation-people-its-cashing-thanks-twitch/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> opening up its top-level domain (</a>.tv). Is Anguilla approaching this opportunity differently than that situation?</strong></p><p><strong>Cate: </strong>Tuvalu gave [domain registrations] to a big foreign company, and locked themselves in for 50 years. And we’re doing it locally. So the government is getting almost all the money. And that’s not what was happening in Tuvalu, right? Most of the money was not going to the country.</p><p><em>[Editor’s note: Tuvalu has</em><a href="https://theworld.org/stories/2022-01-24/tuvalu-cashes-its-coveted-internet-domain-name-amid-rise-online-streaming" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>recently renegotiated</em></a><em> and is leasing its domain name for more money, but an outside company still manages domain registrations.]</em></p><p><strong>How much money is being brought in by .ai registrations, and how is that affecting Anguilla?</strong></p><p><strong>Cate:</strong> It’s about US $3 million per month. We do the domains for two years, and so all of our money now is new domains. And if we just stay at this level of $3 million per month for new domains, when the renewals kick in a year from now, we’ll just jump to $6 million per month.</p><p>And it’s just part of the general budget—the government can use it however they want. But I’ve noticed that they’ve paid down some of their debt, which is pretty unusual. They’ve eliminated property taxes on residential buildings. So we’re doing well, I would say.</p><p><em>This article appears in the February 2024 print issue as “5 Questions for Vince Cate.”</em><br></p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>The photo to the right is of the <strong>Staples parking lot behind the York Road store</strong> in Baltimore, a classic example of a place that needs to be turned back to urban forest — or developed into a much-needed something else. I can’t think of a time when, during fairly frequent trips to this store, I saw more than a dozen vehicles in the long, large lot. And, if you keep it top-of-mind as you travel, you see this sort of thing in many urban and suburban places. As I just suggested in <a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/2024/01/26/dan-rodricks-taylor-swift/"><strong>my Sun</strong></a> <a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/2024/01/26/dan-rodricks-taylor-swift/"><strong>column</strong></a>, Baltimore and the surrounding counties should conduct a “useless parking lot inventory” to identify all impervious surfaces, public or private, that are either no longer needed or too large for their current use. Retail shopping centers in decline, abandoned industrial buildings — remove the unnecessary asphalt and plant some trees.&nbsp;Or do something constructive with this unused, paved space — new housing, a solar energy field.</p>



<p>Part of this is a result of poor planning and ordinance-making that long ago overcompensated for the wide use of automobiles. Henry Grabar, a&nbsp;<a href="https://slate.com/author/henry-grabar">staff writer at Slate</a>, mentions this in a book published last year, <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/paved-paradise-how-parking-explains-the-world-henry-grabar/18727296?gclid=Cj0KCQjw3a2iBhCFARIsAD4jQB2l7xteDcNE8TNeMrWKJX3v-O9ve8ptpT35hMcnccBLCK9GKj8KJksaAgqNEALw_wcB"><em>Paved Paradise: How Parking Explains the World</em></a>. ”On a national level, certainly, there’s far more parking than we need,” Grabar said in <strong><a href="https://www.vox.com/23712664/parking-lots-urban-planning-cities-housing">an interview</a></strong>. “There are at least&nbsp;<a href="https://www.vox.com/a/new-economy-future/cars-cities-technologies">four parking spaces for every car</a>, meaning that the parking stock is no more than 25 percent full at any given time. And some of those cars are moving at any given time, so parking may be a good deal emptier than that.”</p>



<p>I don’t know that anyone besides Grabar is even thinking about this, because parking lots are so deeply embedded in the American psyche, in the environment we take for granted. But certain changes to how we live and work — the demise of malls and the decline of brick-and-mortar retail, the advance of telecommuting in the wake of the pandemic — must have diminished the need for all that asphalt. And all that asphalt effects both <strong><a href="https://www.wbur.org/news/2022/10/24/northeast-boston-asphalt-pavement-cooling-strategies">human health </a></strong>and the <strong><a href="https://www.reuters.com/graphics/CLIMATE-CHANGE/URBAN-HEAT/zgpormdkevd/">health of the planet</a></strong>.</p>

Simply put, it was easier than ever to raise funding for a tech startup. At the same time, cloud computing and smartphones went mainstream and made it easier to build companies, fast.</p><p><strong>Cloud computing brought more efficiency and ease of scalability. </strong><span>To begin a software startup before AWS launched in 2006, a founder needed to purchase and set up servers, then operate them. This required thousands of dollars, and weeks to launch a website. But with a cloud provider, all that was needed was a credit card, and a founder could have a website up and running in minutes, for only a few dollars. Scaling up also became easier and almost always cheaper with the cloud. </span></p><p><span> was at Amazon when AWS was created, and he remembers the paradigm shift in </span><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/the-past-and-future-of-backend-practices" rel="">The past and future of modern backend practices</a><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p>"This transition [to the cloud] enabled early AWS customers like Netflix, Lyft, and Airbnb, to access the same level of computing power as established tech giants, even while these startups were in their infancy. Instead of purchase orders (POs,) months-long lead times, and a large IT department or co-location provider, you only needed a credit card and could start instantly!“</p></blockquote><p>Mainstream cloud commuting means it’s almost trivial – and very cheap – to launch websites, services, data processing pipelines, backends for apps, and anything that is data storage, data processing, and compute. The cloud’s been a major efficiency boost for startups and tech companies. It also makes responding to demand spikes only a matter of buying more cloud resources, or investing in tools like content delivery networks (CDNs.)</p><p><strong>Smartphones created a new, initially cheap, distribution channel. </strong><span>The launch of Apple and Google’s app stores meant smartphone users quickly got hooked on installing apps on their devices. Companies launching mobile apps early on experienced organic growth purely by having an app; some became billion-dollar businesses thanks to launching a mobile app fast, including Spotify (2009,) Instagram (2010,) Airbnb (2010,) Square (2010,) Waze (2010,) Venmo (2010,) Uber (2011,) and Tinder (2012.)</span></p><p><span>By 2015, app stores were saturated with apps, and a native iOS or Android app was no longer an easy way to attract users. Also, many users got </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/02/03/app-fatigue/" rel="">app fatigue</a><span>, meaning startups had to spend on advertising to lure new customers. The average cost of getting a potential customer to install a native app has steadily risen, hitting </span><a href="https://www.businessofapps.com/marketplace/user-acquisition/research/user-acquisition-costs/" rel="">around $5</a><span> in the US in 2023.</span></p><p><strong>What’s next for efficiency and distribution? </strong><span>For tech innovation to continue like it did in the 2010s, wide-ranging efficiency improvements, and a cheap distribution channel are necessary. Currently, AI and large language models (LLMs) are what hopes are pinned on to deliver a major efficiency jump. If AI can successfully be integrated into software engineering workflows, we could see it again become faster and cheaper to build software.&nbsp;</span></p><p><em><span>It’s still unclear how big an improvement AI will deliver, but AI helpers are boosting efficiency, as we covered in an article about </span><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/ai-coding-tools" rel="">the productivity impact of AI coding tools</a><span>.</span></em></p><p>On the other hand, there doesn’t seem to be a new, cheap distribution channel akin to the early internet, or a new gadget that could spur growth without the need for advertising, like the smartphone did. This means that if you build a tech product customers are willing to pay for, you still need to pay platforms like Google for search and app store ads, Meta for social media ads, Apple for app store ads, and Amazon, to reach potential customers. These ads are expensive, and so growth hacking – getting traffic via free or cheap methods – has become more popular with startups.</p><p><strong>The end of the ZIRP period and cheap distribution, can already be felt by those working in tech. </strong><span>It’s harder to get funding, and harder to reach new customers. Most businesses already feel the pressure, and some have responded, but many are yet to. Here’s what this will mean for tech workers, and how to prepare.</span></p><p><span>Since the hottest-ever job market for software engineers in 2021-2022, the number of developer jobs has steadily decreased, and software engineering layoffs have increased.

From Kanat:</p><blockquote><p><span>“</span><strong>Internship applications have doubled.</strong><span> In the past years, we never got more than 400-500 inbound applications for this exact same position. I have to add that many of the applications are, unfortunately, worthless: so many of these are GPT-assisted and spam submissions. This was also the case in the previous years.</span></p><p><strong>Software engineer applications tripled, and there are more Big Tech candidates. </strong><span>In 2022 and 2023, we saw around 150-200 applications for our software engineer role at new grad and the mid-level. What is new this year is how we are getting a lot of masters students apply from all over the US. Lots of applicants have Big Tech experience at the likes of Facebook, Amazon, Google, and so on.</span></p><p><strong>Senior engineers are no longer ‘shopping around’ that much. </strong><span>The number of senior engineer applications remained flat from the last few years. The big difference is how, in past years, there were lots of applicants who weren’t really serious about interviewing.</span></p><p>We now see a lot more senior people who have unfortunately been laid off, and are coming into the interviews with the goal of taking the offer, should they get it.</p><p><strong>Compensation asks are now returning to ‘normal’ levels. </strong><span>When the larger layoff waves in tech started early 2023, we saw a large influx of candidates. However, back then, compensation expectations from these people were out of reach for what we had to offer – and what we considered competitive. The big change is that most applicants are asking for more ‘normal’ packages that are in-line what we have consistently been offering.”&nbsp;</span></p></blockquote><p><span>One thing that is a bit misleading in just looking at the number of appklications is how, in the case of SupplyPike – even though they do not advertise it – there is more than one headcount behind their advertised positions. Kanat shared that they optimistically expect to hire maybe 4-5 interns, 2-3 software engineers and 1-2 senior engineers in the coming months. This type of split is pretty common across companies, so let’s adjust it to the higher number (so: e.g. to 5 interns planned to hire), to see how many inbound applicants there </span><em>could</em><span> be for one position hired:</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0596b453-8a13-49aa-ab79-492cbcb62b30_1630x1268.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0596b453-8a13-49aa-ab79-492cbcb62b30_1630x1268.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0596b453-8a13-49aa-ab79-492cbcb62b30_1630x1268.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0596b453-8a13-49aa-ab79-492cbcb62b30_1630x1268.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0596b453-8a13-49aa-ab79-492cbcb62b30_1630x1268.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0596b453-8a13-49aa-ab79-492cbcb62b30_1630x1268.png" width="1456" height="1133" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0596b453-8a13-49aa-ab79-492cbcb62b30_1630x1268.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1133,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:283706,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0596b453-8a13-49aa-ab79-492cbcb62b30_1630x1268.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0596b453-8a13-49aa-ab79-492cbcb62b30_1630x1268.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0596b453-8a13-49aa-ab79-492cbcb62b30_1630x1268.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0596b453-8a13-49aa-ab79-492cbcb62b30_1630x1268.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>A more realistic view on about how many inbound applications came in per open headcount over 2 months to&nbsp; SupplyPike for hybrid positions advertised</figcaption></figure></div><p><strong>Better-known companies and full-remote ones will see more competition than the chart above. </strong><span>SupplyPike is a good data point to look at, because the company is not as well-known as Big Tech; and it requires candidates to relocate to take the position. At the same time, within the Arkansas region, it is one of the more attractive employer, given it is a well-funded scaleup, and a tech-first company.</span></p><p>Keep in mind how competition will be much more fierce both at better-known “brand” companies, as well as companies that hire full-remote, across a whole country or a region. And even when applying to attractive, but lesser-known companies: expect that your competition could well be former Big Tech software engineers, like it is the case with SupplyPike.</p><p>When there were not enough qualified applicants for senior roles in a country, companies sponsored visas and paid for engineers to relocate from abroad. However, it’s an employer’s market now, so candidates that need no visa sponsorship or relocation have immediate preference. The only exceptions are highly specialized jobs which few people can do, or ones where the pay is too low for local candidates.</p><p>A hiring manager told me they expect plenty of companies will still offer visa sponsorship, but that more won’t cover relocation costs, and will leave it up to a candidate to decide if they’re willing to pay to relocate.</p><p>If you want to move to another country, seek companies that find your skillset and experience hard to hire for, locally, and aim to apply to them. If you can’t find such businesses, you might need to build up more expertise in a niche field, or become better known in the segment you work in.</p><p>When money wasn’t an issue, exceeding allocated headcount to close a standout candidate was common enough. At Uber, I observed hiring managers occasionally making the case for hiring, even when they’d run out of headcount. The justification was that stand out candidates were rare, and the headcount could be deducted from the next half year’s budget. This led to some “headcount trading” between teams, or for budget changes to be approved at director-level.</p><p><span>Well, this is far rarer, these days.

In March 2023, he published a deep dive on how marketing companies use data warehouses, and extract marketing insights internally.

It’s likely that this will be for senior roles, and for positions that help generate revenue: just like Martech engineers help sales and marketing teams get more customers and close more deals.</p><p>So, how do you approach job hunting in a more challenging job market?</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>At the onset of the pandemic, we found ourselves at a pivotal crossroads that compelled us to reimagine how we work. This shift was as profound as it was inevitable, marking our turn towards a new direction in reshaping the essence of our ways of working. Work from home has now stabilized at ~30% in the U.S. as of December 2023, which is almost four times pre-pandemic levels, according to a recent paper from the <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257%2Fjep.37.4.23" target="_blank" title="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257%2Fjep.37.4.23" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257%2Fjep.37.4.23" aria-label="American Economic Association">American Economic Association</a>.</p>


<p>The paradigmatic shift induced by remote work has enabled businesses to remodel their operational cost structures and redefine new ways of working. Companies are now navigating a landscape that oscillates between in-person, fully remote, and hybrid workforce models, each presenting its unique set of opportunities and challenges.</p>

<p>According to a recent research paper published by <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4675401" target="_blank" title="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4675401" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4675401" aria-label="University of Pittsburgh">University of Pittsburgh</a>, compelling evidence suggests that organizations are leveraging Return-To-Office mandates not to enhance firm value, but rather to reassert control and shift blame for poor performance onto employees. Contrary to the belief that RTO boosts company value, the analysis revealed that RTO mandates are more likely in firms with poor recent stock performance and have had no significant impacts on firm profitability or stock-returns. Moreover, a notable drop in employee job satisfaction was observed, further questioning the efficacy of these mandates.</p>


<p>Offices across the U.S. are at an all-time occupancy low, and commercial real estate is starting to see an all-time high of almost 20% of unleased space, according to the <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/offices-around-america-hit-a-new-vacancy-record/ar-AA1mCCkd?ocid=finance-verthp-feeds" target="_blank" title="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/offices-around-america-hit-a-new-vacancy-record/ar-AA1mCCkd?ocid=finance-verthp-feeds" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/offices-around-america-hit-a-new-vacancy-record/ar-AA1mCCkd?ocid=finance-verthp-feeds" aria-label="Wall Street Journal">Wall Street Journal</a>. The reduction in real estate spend has enabled companies to reduce their operating expenses, thereby positively impacting their financial health. This poses the question: Are return-to-work mandates better for the workforce or for business bottom lines?</p>

<h2>Connecting To All Stakeholders</h2>
<p>A considerable number of companies continue to grapple with the right model that aligns with the preferences and philosophies of all stakeholders involved - customers, employees, boards, leadership teams, and shareholders. Many companies, albeit reluctantly, were forced to embrace a remote work model during the pandemic, discovering the potential for enhancing productivity while reducing costs for long-term business growth in a virtual environment.</p>

<p>Airbnb exemplified this, having navigated an abrupt halt in revenue at the onset of the pandemic to achieving profitability and executing a successful IPO shortly thereafter, all while operating entirely remotely. Airbnb leveraged their learnings to create a unique <a href="https://news.airbnb.com/airbnbs-design-to-live-and-work-anywhere/" target="_blank" title="https://news.airbnb.com/airbnbs-design-to-live-and-work-anywhere/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://news.airbnb.com/airbnbs-design-to-live-and-work-anywhere/" aria-label="Live and Work Anywhere">Live and Work Anywhere </a>program in April 2022, which balanced a blend of remote work and in-person gatherings. The program was a great success because it tied to their business model and promoted remote work for all their stakeholders, including their shareholders, employees, and their customers (guests and hosts).</p>

<p>However, CEOs of companies like WebMD continue to poorly <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/7kxqnx/dont-mess-with-us-webmd-parent-company-demands-return-to-office-in-bizarre-video" target="_blank" title="https://www.vice.com/en/article/7kxqnx/dont-mess-with-us-webmd-parent-company-demands-return-to-office-in-bizarre-video" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.vice.com/en/article/7kxqnx/dont-mess-with-us-webmd-parent-company-demands-return-to-office-in-bizarre-video" aria-label="communicate">communicate</a> demands and convey threats to their employees in 2024 by telling their employees, “Don't mess with us.” The irony in this approach is that some of their products, like their <a href="https://symptoms.webmd.com/" target="_blank" title="https://symptoms.webmd.com/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://symptoms.webmd.com/" aria-label="online symptom checker">online symptom checker</a>, are tools that help anyone to remotely evaluate their symptoms and determine treatments needed. Why are companies that promote remote services so opposed to enabling remote work, and more importantly, feel the need to threaten their employees?</p>


<p>Last week at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, the CEO of L’Oreal insisted that he was certain that remote workers in their organization lacked attachment, passion, and creativity. He went on to explain that remote work was bad for the mental health of employees, according to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/remote-workers-lack-passion-and-creativity-loreal-ceo-says-2024-1" target="_blank" title="https://www.businessinsider.com/remote-workers-lack-passion-and-creativity-loreal-ceo-says-2024-1" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.businessinsider.com/remote-workers-lack-passion-and-creativity-loreal-ceo-says-2024-1" aria-label="Business Insider">Business Insider</a>.</p>
<h2>The Unintended Consequences</h2>
<p>Mandating in-office attendance raises questions about the resulting employee behaviors and employer reactions. With enforced attendance, mechanisms like badge access tracking have been implemented in several companies.</p>
<p>Will these enforcements result in action being taken, thereby losing or reprimanding engaged talent, or will this just be an empty threat? Companies that mandate office attendance for their workers will likely inherently create the opposite effect they intended. This will result in a subculture of employees going in to grab a coffee and then leave (coffee-badging) or share their badges with co-workers (shadow-badging) to meet the mandates.</p>
<p>While mandating these extreme return-to-office policies, companies end up restricting their operations to specific geographic locations and are limiting their talent pool to the same boundaries. On the other hand, being completely remote has a direct impact on onboarding new hires into company culture and can sometimes lower engagement and motivation as employees may lose a strong sense of belonging and connection over time. There can also be a disconnect between the desire to work remotely between the leadership teams across various functions within an organization, thereby resulting in inconsistent behaviors.</p>
<h2>What's Next?</h2>
<p>Executives should focus on figuring out the right workforce model for their business while recognizing that there is not a one-size-fits-all solution. The key is to focus on implementing a model that is reflective of the nature of their own business model and stakeholder needs. This does not mean that hybrid work with mandating office attendance a few times a week is the only option.</p>
<p>Companies should adopt an intentional and regular gathering strategy for all employees to connect routinely. By doing so, they can recharge their social barometers, which is essential for driving organizational alignment, motivation, and engagement. It’s time to move on from debating what model is best and focus on driving momentum on business outcomes.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p><em>Cybersecurity Researcher, Jeremiah Fowler, discovered and reported to <a name="COVID_Test_Data_Breach:_1.3_Million_Patient_Records_Exposed_Online-2125721894" href="https://www.vpnmentor.com/" target="_blank">vpnMentor</a> about a non-password protected database that contained nearly 1.3 million records, which included COVID-19 testing information and personally identifiable information such as the patient’s name, date of birth, and passport number.</em></p>
<p>The publicly exposed database contained an estimated 1.3 million records that included 118,441 certificates, 506,663 appointments, 660,173 testing samples, and a small number of internal application files. The exposed certificates and other documents were all marked with the name and logo of Coronalab.eu. Although the website appears to be offline, Coronalab is owned by Microbe &amp; Lab, an ISO-certified laboratory based in Amsterdam, Netherlands. According to the <a name="COVID_Test_Data_Breach:_1.3_Million_Patient_Records_Exposed_Online-615950139" href="https://nltimes.nl/2020/10/02/dutch-businesses-increasingly-turning-commercial-covid-tests" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">NL Times</a>, “CoronaLab is one of the two largest commercial test providers in the Netherlands”. I sent multiple responsible disclosure notices and did not receive any reply and several phone calls also yielded no results. The database remained open for nearly 3 weeks before I contacted the cloud hosting provider and it was finally secured from public access. In most cases the organization replies or closes public access immediately after receiving a responsible disclosure notice. Another research-based online publication, Cybernews, claimed to have found a similar leak around the same time of my discovery. I cannot confirm if it's related or not.</p>
<p>The exposed COVID test records contained each patient’s name, nationality, passport number, and test results, as well as the price, location, and type of test conducted. The database also contained thousands of QR codes and hundreds of.csv files that showed appointment details and many patients’ email addresses. With personal data and emails exposed, cybercriminals could attempt to exploit this information or launch targeted phishing campaigns using internal information or posing as a laboratory employee. The criminal could potentially reference test dates, locations, or other insider information that only the patient and the laboratory would know. Any potential exposure involving COVID test data combined with PII could potentially compromise the personal and medical privacy of the individuals listed in the documents.</p>
<p>According to the Microbe &amp; Lab website: <em>Coronalab.eu is an online platform which helps individuals and companies to test for COVID-19. We do this with a fast COVID test service (PCR test, the Rapid test and the Serological test) with which we can guarantee same day results. Tests include a free travel certificate.</em></p>
<p>During the height of the pandemic, proof of a negative COVID test was required for nearly all everyday life activities. In many cases, testing was often mandatory for travel, special events, and even employment. There was a massive amount of COVID test data collected in a short period of time, which needed to be accessible for patients or verifications, yet still secure from unauthorized access. Even under normal conditions, data and cloud storage infrastructure takes time to build, test, and properly configure. The speed of the pandemic and the massive amount of testing data forced many laboratories and medical facilities around the world to rush the process. This increased the risk for permission and configuration errors in data storage and data protection. In my professional opinion, now that the pandemic is mostly behind us, it is time for organizations to review the massive amounts of data they have stored and determine if these records are still needed. If they are, organizations must ensure the data is secured from unauthorized access. The records should be encrypted or anonymized to prevent unwanted data exposures or threats from malicious actors.</p>


<h2><span>Possible risks of this exposure</span></h2>
<p>Leaked COVID-19 test results could potentially turn into a breach of personal and health information, compromising the individual privacy of those who may have been affected. The issue of COVID became a contentious political issue full of misinformation, conspiracy theories, and social repercussions that divided people around the world. Many people still don’t want to disclose their vaccine status or if they previously tested positive for COVID for fear of stigmatization. It is not known if anyone else gained access to the exposed COVID test data.</p>
<p>The public exposure of COVID tests has a range of potential future risks due to the fact that so much is still unknown about the long-term health effects of the virus, and we don’t know how pandemic-era data could be used years later. Hypothetically, insurers could raise premium rates if research showed that those who were infected with the virus had a higher risk of future health issues. Overall, leaked COVID test results not only pose risks to personal and medical privacy, but they could also affect how patients view public healthcare providers and how much they trust them to safeguard their medical data. It's crucial for healthcare organizations and technology providers to prioritize data security, including data storage and cybersecurity measures. Another important issue healthcare providers must face is to implement clear record retention policies to determine how long medical records should be kept and how to prevent the risks associated with data that is no longer being actively used.</p>
<p>A passport is a government-issued identity document that contains information intended to be private. Exposed passport details — such as the document number, full name, date of birth, and nationality — could be potentially valuable pieces of information for identity thieves and cyber criminals. Passport data has the potential to be misused for various fraudulent activities, ranging from travel-related fraud (such as booking flights, renting cars, or hotel reservations) to opening financial accounts in the passport holder's name. I am not implying that the people whose passports were exposed were ever at imminent risk; I only mean to provide a real-world example of potential repercussions.</p>
<p>The database contained a large number of test result QR codes. A Quick Response (QR) code can store various types of data, such as website URLs, text, contact information, or commands. Nearly every phone camera can scan a QR code without any additional software. When QR codes store and transmit sensitive data (such as personal details, passport data, and medical test results) in plain text, the codes represent a potential security risk in case they are publicly exposed. In this instance, I was able to scan numerous QR codes and see the test results and all the confidential personal data they contained. As useful and as user friendly as QR codes are, they can be a major security risk. For example, the codes can be easily changed to redirect users to fake websites or prompt them to download malware or other malicious applications. I highly recommend any organization that uses QR codes containing personal information to implement proper security measures to safeguard sensitive data. Encrypting the information, for instance, can help prevent potential threats to privacy and security.</p>
<p>It is unknown how long the data was publicly exposed or if anyone else may have accessed the thousands of COVID-related records. Only an internal forensic audit would identify if others may have accessed the database or performed any other suspicious activity. It is also unclear if customers, patients, or the authorities have been notified of the data incident. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) governs data protection and privacy for individuals within the EU and the European Economic Area (EEA). Medical data, including COVID test results, are classified as sensitive personal data or as a special type of personal data under the GDPR regulations. Organizations who collect and store medical data must adhere to the GDPR's stringent requirements regarding data protection, ensuring confidentiality and security when processing potentially sensitive information. This also includes the technical measures to safeguard data against unauthorized access or any public data exposure.</p>
<p>As an ethical researcher, I never download the data I discover. I only access a minimal sample for verification purposes and redact PII for privacy. Although all records were marked with names and logos of Coronalab and Microbe &amp; Lab, it is unknown who owned or managed the database. I imply no wrongdoing by Microbe &amp; Lab, CoronaLab.eu, or any of their partners or affiliates. Furthermore, I do not imply that patients or data are at imminent risk. I publish my findings to raise awareness and underscore the importance of cybersecurity best practices.</p>

<p>There’s a certain type of British festival, where middle-class, middle-aged parents relive the glory days&nbsp;with their children in tow. It’s all cult bands from the Nineties, craft ales, and fairy lights in the broadleaved woodlands to make the walk to the campsite both pretty and safe. Kids’ activities might include pottery workshops or forest play —&nbsp;and they’re led by an enthusiastic couple whose nose piercings and tattoos are offset by the comforting knowledge that they’re fully trained, and DBS checked. Mum and Dad can go off to the wood-fired hot tub for an hour and know that their children will emerge unscratched by sticks and enriched by the important experience of playing with them.</p>


<p>This is the 21st-century vision of play: it’s safe, organised, educational, always supervised by adults. And it might have killed off what we <em>used</em> to think of as play: kids running around whatever space they could find, improvising unpredictable games and creating social worlds unfathomable to their parents.</p>

<p>Children are far less free than they used to be. While 71% of Boomers and 80% of Gen X recall playing in the street as children, <a href="https://www.savethechildren.org.uk/news/media-centre/press-releases/children-today-62-percent-less-likely-to-play-outside-than-their" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only 27% of children do today</a>. And last week, MPs <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/work/7981/children-young-people-and-the-built-environment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heard evidence</a> in an inquiry into how the built environment restricts children’s independence, with charities warning that a lack of outdoor play is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/jan/23/children-suffering-due-to-lack-of-outdoor-play-uk-charities-warn" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very bad for their development</a>.</p>

<p>In urbanised environments, where land is at an all-time premium, finding a place to run around can be a challenge. One in eight children <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/coronavirus-uk-lockdown-garden-access-outdoor-space-black-race-ons-a9514766.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">don’t have a garden</a>&nbsp;and nearly 800 playgrounds <a href="https://www.aggregate.com/right-play-fois-reveal-huge-decline-play-park-facilities-uk#:~:text=793%20play%20parks%20have%20been%20closed%20down%20in%20the%20last%20ten%20years&amp;text=This%20new%20data%20shows%20a,over%20the%20last%20five%20years." target="_blank" rel="noopener">have closed in the past decade</a>. But this doesn’t account for the precipitous collapse of playing on the street, when roads are more regulated and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reported_Road_Casualties_Great_Britain#/media/File:Killed_on_British_Roads.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">safer than ever before</a>. Nor does it acknowledge that there are still <a href="https://creativeplayuk.com/what-is-the-difference-between-a-playground-and-a-park/#:~:text=There%20are%20over%2027%2C000%20parks,councils%20countrywide%20in%20the%20UK." target="_blank" rel="noopener">16,000 playgrounds</a> maintained by local authorities in the UK, and 27,000 parks. There must be some other factors at work.</p>


<p>Having a child is generally perceived as harder than it used to be. In three quarters of families in which the parents are together, <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/articles/familiesandthelabourmarketengland/2021#:~:text=Couple%20families%20are%20defined%20as,were%20not%20employed%20(inactive)." target="_blank" rel="noopener">both of them work</a>. And childcare costs have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/jun/13/uk-childcare-costs-soar-by-more-than-2000-in-a-decade-tuc-says" target="_blank" rel="noopener">risen precipitously</a>. There has been an attendant <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.872981/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener">boom</a> in helicopter parenting, with couples more focused than ever on the details of their kids’ development. Their aim is to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/25/upshot/the-relentlessness-of-modern-parenting.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">optimise their lives</a> —&nbsp;and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter_parent" target="_blank" rel="noopener">excise all bad externalities</a>.</p>

<p>But this safetyist instinct does have blind spots. While parents might be grilled in A&amp;E if they bring in their child with a minor injury from climbing a tree; nobody tells you off for parking your toddler on the iPad for half an hour that turns into half a day. If your kids are a bit pallid from spending more time online than outside, that’s accepted as normal. Safeguarding culture is obsessed with preventing tangible, acute injuries such as cuts and bruises, but the slower chronic harms that emerge over years are often ignored — even though we know, and lament, that children are increasingly <a href="https://stateofchildhealth.rcpch.ac.uk/evidence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less physically and mentally healthy</a>.</p>

<p>At the heart of this issue is whether children are free to exercise their instincts. Dutch cultural theorist Johan Huizinga saw play as primal: just like any other young animal, children have an intrinsic drive to play, and don’t need to be taught how to do it.&nbsp; Huizinga defines play as an act of self-directed freedom. It can only really happen when children are left to their own devices, which requires parents to ignore them.</p>


<p>To modern helicopter parents, this can feel counterintuitive. We are increasingly uncomfortable about our children’s discomfort: the influence of safetyism can be seen in how we approach their emotional lives as well as their corporeal ones. Parents worry that <a href="https://time.com/4419331/boredom-parenting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">boredom is bad</a> —&nbsp;when actually, <a href="https://theconversation.com/how-kids-can-benefit-from-boredom-65596" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it is an important learning</a> experience. It’s a transitional space in which the child realises that she needs to do something differently. She might then try to attract a parent’s attention. If she doesn’t get it, she gets fractious; if she is still ignored, she eventually finds something else to do. If we leave that novelty-seeking impulse to develop, it turns into creativity. It just needs time.</p>
<p>This is increasingly difficult, though, now that we all have distraction machines in the palms of our hands. Most adults won’t choose the disgruntlement of boredom over the abundance of synthetic novelties on offer online — which makes it hard to admonish a child for seeking the Xbox or the iPad rather than inventing their own forms of entertainment.</p>

<p>And it’s true that when play involves temporary social orders, it brings discomfort with it. Playing out in the street means muddling along with whoever else is out there; it means trying — and often failing — to assert one’s role in an emergent group, which might be big, and include kids who are taller and older and cleverer. When children play structured games, whether it’s hide and seek or a ball game or soldiers fighting in the trenches, they have to abide by the rules of engagement —&nbsp;and deal with losing.</p>


<p>In other words, play is a good warm-up for life. But, crucially, it doesn’t take place for material or real-world gain. The goals exist outside of the goals we ordinarily strive for, and they evaporate. Kids need to be emotionally committed enough to want to win, but not so invested that they kick off when they don’t. At a time when children spend years of their lives being examined and graded in school, there’s benefit in both learning to strive and learning to let go.</p>

<p>True play also teaches kids how to deal with uncertainty. So argued the French sociologist Roger Caillois, who built on Huizinga’s theory, emphasising that play isn’t predetermined, but animated by chaos. Hence why play necessarily comes with risk. Now, children are far more likely to engage in a sort of pseudo-play, either in the form of online games, which are pipelines of reliable and predictable dopamine hits, or educational games, which are led by the parent or teacher rather than by children themselves, and where the goals are geared towards real-world pedagogical gain. Whereas Huizinga argued that play happens outside of ordinary life — and is therefore a kind of anarchy — pseudo-play conforms entirely to conventional structures, whether it’s the gaming-industrial complex or the lifestyle capitalism promoting Important Experiences.</p>

<p>The forest schools and educational toys and tasteful wooden games that sneakily give kids lessons about biodiversity or engineering or maths may be wholesome, even captivating, but they’re anything but self-organising. We see this in the adult world of play, too. A festival was once a break from normal social order — a temporary, wild otherworld. Now, it’s a luxurious curated experience. Whereas play, for Caillois, was “an occasion of pure waste: waste of time, energy, ingenuity, skill, and often of money”, now, everything has to be optimised. But what happens when we’re not allowed to be wasteful? When all our earliest memories are goal-oriented, outcome-focused, organised?</p>



<p>A therapist friend who works with students at a nearby high-performing university observes that they often arrive burnt out and depressed. He’ll ask them what is meaningful to them, what their vision of a better life would be. They’ll go silent, confused. Deciding that, surely, is his job? Their motivation for going to therapy isn’t to find meaning — it is the knowledge that you need to look after your mental health in order to be productive. His strategy is to be playful with them, which rattles them at first, but they soon soften into it. Their thinking relaxes, and they start to find new avenues out of their malaise.</p>

<p>Play, then, is an essential part of growing up —&nbsp;and, later, of life. For Huizinga, play was a sign of the “mind breaking down the determinism of the cosmos”, of a person forging their own path. Hence why play is getting harder: the techno-capitalist society we currently inhabit militates against autonomy; if people are to be interchangeable units of labour in a bigger machine, they have to do as they’re told. And so it sets out clear performance indicators for us, a tick-list of achievements in our roles as children, parents, workers and social beings, from which deviation feels like failure.</p>
<p>If we lose autonomy, we tend to lose faith in ourselves. For parents, this can manifest as fear: what if my child is unhappy, what if they get hurt, what if I haven’t done enough for them? Letting go is the best way to point children towards the path to a fulfilling life. Providing space for them to play isn’t just about parks and gardens — it’s about knowing when to trust them to work things out for themselves, and to cope when things go wrong.</p>

<p>An&nbsp;investigation is still underway and no charges have yet been&nbsp;filed, police said.</p>

<p>The Saxon State Criminal Police Office said the seizure of 50,000 bitcoins&nbsp;could be the biggest to date&nbsp;of its kind in Germany.</p>

<p>Police said they were investigating two men, aged 40 and 37, who are suspected of running a piracy website until the end of 2013. Authorities allege the men&nbsp;bought&nbsp;bitcoins from the money they earned from the portal.</p>

<p>They added that their investigation was into suspected unauthorized commercial exploitation of copyrighted works&nbsp;and subsequent commercial money laundering.</p>

<h2>Suspects&nbsp;transfer bitcoins to federal agency</h2>

<p>The seizure came after the "accused&nbsp;voluntarily transferred" the bitcoins to an official wallet&nbsp;of the Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA),&nbsp;police added in a&nbsp;statement.</p>

<p>The BKA did not provide further details about the transfer, but investigators cited by German news agency dpa said no decisions had been made regarding cashing in the bitcoins.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Police said&nbsp;no further information would be available until the investigation comes to a close.&nbsp;</p>

Let’s move on to when you receive a letter.</p><p><span>On the actual day that things went down, the first thing I noticed was that I couldn’t log into my Facebook or Instagram accounts. Then, 5 hours later — Thursday evening at midnight — </span><a href="https://louisbarclay.notion.site/Unfollow-Everything-cease-and-desist-letter-from-Facebook-ea219169421b457bb7ce010b7bf9ce1f?pvs=4" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">I received the cease-and-desist letter</a><span>. I didn’t really understand what it was. I would have wanted to know that:</span></p><ol><li><p><span>There was </span><strong>virtually zero chance of going to jail</strong><span>, or indeed court (in retrospect, it seems crazy that I was worried about this — but it shows just how scary the experience was, and how ill-equipped I was to deal with it)</span></p></li><li><p><span>A cease-and-desist letter </span><strong>doesn’t mean any kind of formal legal action has started</strong><span> against you. It’s notionally a first step towards that kind of thing, but in practice it’s used to scare you into doing what the company wants — and if you do it, they are unlikely to go further</span></p></li><li><p><span>Companies can put all sorts of outrageous claims and demands in a cease-and-desist letter, even if they aren’t true or legally enforceable. </span><strong>It’s essentially a bullying tactic.</strong><span> They can reference parts of their terms of service that you signed up to, which will make things sound scarier, but those terms may themselves be completely unfair</span></p><ul><li><p>Companies have unfair terms of service because they are a wishlist of how they’d like the world to work — which will stand until it gets challenged in court or chastised by a regulator (and that will take years!).</p></li><li><p>So even if the company is quoting their terms of service at you, bear in mind that some of these may be completely unenforceable if the matter were to reach court</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>The point of cease-and-desist letters is to get you to stop.</strong><span> If you stop, and if you didn’t do anything very bad at all, likely that’ll be the end of the matter. I get the sense that the key metric the law firm representing the Big Tech company is trying to hit is quite simply ‘did they stop?’. Although the company may still keep following up with other demands, as we’ll see later</span></p></li><li><p><strong>The letter may try to gaslight you.</strong><span> There may be claims in there that are false, defamatory, insulting, etc. This doesn’t mean that you can take their threats any less seriously, unfortunately. But it does make the whole situation even more messed up. Do not rush to react to these false claims — go to the next section first</span></p></li></ol><p>So. You’re staring at your cease-and-desist letter. What should you do next?</p><ol><li><p><span>I’m depressed to be writing this, but if it’s relatively costless to you to pause providing the software or service they’re targeting, and if you don’t have access to $$$ of legal funds, </span><strong>I would go ahead and pause immediately.</strong><span> The reality is that you’re being bullied by a firm with virtually infinite resources and at this point, while you’re still in shock and scared, it’s probably best to simply take a pause. You can always change your mind later, once you’ve had a chance to get more comfortable with the situation</span></p></li><li><p><span>There may be an aggressive deadline to respond on the cease-and-desist letter. For me, it was 48 hours — and I received it on a Thursday night at midnight! I would strongly advise that you </span><strong>don’t rush to respond to the letter</strong><span>, and find a lawyer to advise you first. The last thing you want to do is reply with an email where you make a bunch of statements that the company can use against you, because you don’t understand the law. A 48 hour deadline is plainly ridiculous — that’s not enough time to get legal advice and decide how to respond. It’s all part of the bullying tactics. But you should still respond within a week or so</span></p></li><li><p><span>There also may be a laundry list of demands in the letter: explain how your software works, give a list of the domains you own and apps you operate, tell us the revenue you made from the software, agree to never again do X, Y, Z. </span><strong>I would roundly ignore all of their demands for now</strong><span>, and simply stick to pausing the software or service, and not responding yet to their letter</span></p></li><li><p>Bringing those points together looks like:</p><ol><li><p>Find a lawyer</p></li><li><p>Pause the software or service, if there’s minimal downside to doing so</p></li><li><p>Don’t reply until you find a lawyer</p></li></ol></li><li><p><span>Another thing to note: at this point, you’ll likely have been banned from the platform. But if you haven’t been (yet), </span><strong>immediately download all your data from all accounts</strong><span>. They might not yet have spotted an account or two</span></p></li></ol><p>Receiving a cease-and-desist letter is a great lifehack to realizing this fundamentally depressing fact about most legal systems*:</p><p><strong>It doesn’t matter if you’re right. It matters if you have money, time, and willpower to go to court.</strong></p><p>Let’s say you find a lawyer, as advised in the previous section. You consult them about the cease-and-desist letter, and they are bowled over by how weak the legal arguments are. They say there’s no way a judge or jury would allow their demands and their ban to stand. Great!</p><p>Nope. Because now you’d need to risk your finances, mental health and years of your life to litigate against the Big Tech company. In other words, it’s completely irrelevant that you’re right and they’re wrong.</p><p>So:</p><p><strong>Even if you are sure you are in the right, and that you would almost certainly win in court, you can’t realistically do anything about it. The sooner you accept that, the better.</strong></p><p>The exception: if you are working at a university or some other big organization (or if you’re extremely rich). In that case, you’ll have lawyers aplenty — although the mental toll, and the time you’ll have to spend, may still not be worth it. And you’re still unlikely to get your accounts back, since platforms are at liberty to deny you access to them for a whole variety of reasons.</p><p>Still determined to take the matter to court, but don’t have the money? You can do two things:</p><ol><li><p>Crowdfund. And it will be difficult, since there are more worthwhile things people can donate to than a legal case against an enormous company which you’re unlikely to win</p></li><li><p><span>Ask a foundation for money. Try to get funding for your legal fees from foundations like </span><a href="https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">OSF</a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.luminategroup.com/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Luminate</a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.reset.tech/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Reset</a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.fordfoundation.org/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Ford Foundation</a><span> (some of the biggest players in funding tech activism). That’ll also be difficult, unless you already know them or can get a very warm intro. These foundations prefer working with people they know and trust, especially on legal issues — and even then, they might not see it as strategically valuable to fund your particular case. An added complication might be that they won’t even know how much money to set aside, since legal fees can balloon over time</span></p></li></ol><p><em>*Apparently there are some legal systems, particularly in Europe, where the costs of taking Big Tech to court are lower. You’d have to ask your lawyer about that. The time and willpower aspects may be similar though.</em></p><p><span>With that in mind, how to respond? You have three options, </span><a href="https://lawpath.com.au/blog/how-to-respond-to-a-cease-and-desist-letter" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">as laid out by this handy article</a><span>:</span></p><ol><li><p>Ignore</p></li><li><p>Comply</p></li><li><p>Defend</p></li></ol><p>Ignoring completely, and choosing to keep offering your software or service, is incredibly risky. The Big Tech company may very likely take you to court, and that would really suck. So I would not recommend .</p><p>Complying is the best way to make this whole issue disappear and get your life back to normal, but you can always do so selectively: stop doing whatever you’re doing (take down the app, stop the service), but then ignore other demands that you see as unfair or onerous. Based on my experience, it’s likely the Big Tech company will not pursue you any further, although they may follow up for a while (see below).</p><p>There is an important exception: if you desperately need your accounts back, for instance your entire livelihood depends on it. If that’s the case, you probably want to comply fully with every single thing they ask — be a completely open book. Don’t be remotely adversarial in any of your dealings. There will still be no guarantee of getting any accounts back, but it’s your only chance.</p><p>Finally, you can defend yourself, if you have the time, money and willpower. But as dealt with in the previous section, that could end up being seriously, seriously painful, even if you are completely in the right.</p><p>There is, however, a way for you to fight back through non-legal means:</p><p>If you want to get catharsis and cause Big Tech grief, the most viable option is to take the fight to the court of public opinion. Tell the world about what happened.</p><ol><li><p>Post about the letter everywhere you can. Keep up a drumbeat! One post won’t get you anywhere</p></li><li><p>Try to enlist sympathetic journalists to write about the situation. A lot of journalists are open to cold outreach through social media</p></li><li><p>Reach out to superusers of your app and other sympathisers, and ask them to share your posts widely</p></li><li><p>Contact politicians who represent you, for instance your local senator or representative, or your MP. At the very least, they may be able to link you to journalists or offer their sympathy</p></li></ol><p>Worth noting that this strategy is most likely to go well if your software or research was in the public interest.</p><p><strong>Side note:</strong><span> if your situation attracts a lot of interest, you may find yourself completely overwhelmed by messages from journalists, tweets from sympathetic followers, emails of support etc.</span></p><p>I don’t know how I could have managed this better, but I’d just say — be aware that it could happen, and that even well-meaning support and valuable media interest can cause a huge amount of stress.</p><p>If you agree to do an interview, consider doing some online training around how to talk to the media so that you get the points across that you want to, and so you don’t say anything on record that you don’t want to.</p><p><span>One deeply unpleasant part of the whole situation was how often, and for how long, Facebook followed up. For </span><strong>an entire year, from July 2021 to June 2022</strong><span>, they kept sending me emails, like the world’s most efficient stalker. They then finally went quiet, and I haven’t heard from them since. (Miss you guys!)</span></p><p>At the beginning, they sent numerous follow-ups asking for me to agree to all of the demands in the original letter.</p><p><span>Then there was a period of radio silence, until </span><strong>7 months later they sent through a new document</strong><span>, which they called a ‘Proposed Agreement’. </span><a href="https://louisbarclay.notion.site/Unfollow-Everything-cease-and-desist-letter-from-Facebook-ea219169421b457bb7ce010b7bf9ce1f?pvs=4" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">I’m publishing this document here for the first ever time</a><span>, in case it’s useful to anyone.</span></p><p>The document dangled the possibility of my Facebook and Instagram accounts being reinstated if I agreed to similar demands to those in the initial cease-and-desist letter (like agreeing to never make any software again that interacts with Facebook), but with a fun twist:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F116239ff-177c-4b89-a451-d64b28e88513_613x147.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel="nofollow ugc noopener"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F116239ff-177c-4b89-a451-d64b28e88513_613x147.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F116239ff-177c-4b89-a451-d64b28e88513_613x147.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F116239ff-177c-4b89-a451-d64b28e88513_613x147.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F116239ff-177c-4b89-a451-d64b28e88513_613x147.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F116239ff-177c-4b89-a451-d64b28e88513_613x147.png" width="613" height="147" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/116239ff-177c-4b89-a451-d64b28e88513_613x147.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:147,&quot;width&quot;:613,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:37236,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F116239ff-177c-4b89-a451-d64b28e88513_613x147.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F116239ff-177c-4b89-a451-d64b28e88513_613x147.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F116239ff-177c-4b89-a451-d64b28e88513_613x147.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F116239ff-177c-4b89-a451-d64b28e88513_613x147.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>In other words, if I agreed to the letter and then went onto breach the terms, Facebook would automatically be entitled to at least $30k.

again!</figcaption></figure></div><p>So a couple of things to bear in mind:</p><ol><li><p><strong>You will receive follow-ups.</strong><span> That much is basically certain, and based on my experience with Facebook, it could be for a while</span></p></li><li><p><strong>You might be given some ray of hope about being able to get your account back.</strong><span> But you’d be sensible to ignore this if the language is anything like what I received. If you really, really need your account back, you might want to get a lawyer to draft a response saying you’ll consider signing if the wording is tweaked to guarantee that your accounts will be restored.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24054862/apple-vision-pro-review-vr-ar-headset-features-price">https://www.theverge.com/24054862/apple-vision-pro-review-vr-ar-headset-features-price</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39190506">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>There’s a lot of pressure on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23689334/apple-mixed-reality-headset-augmented-virtual-reality-ar-vr-rumors-specs-features">the new Apple Vision Pro</a>, Apple’s long-awaited entry into the world of computers you wear on your face. Apple claims that the Vision Pro, which starts at $3,499, is the beginning of something called “spatial computing,” which basically boils down to running apps all around you. And the company’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/28/24053854/apples-new-vision-pro-ad-is-one-you-mightve-seen-before">ads for it</a> do not hedge that pressure even a little: they show people wearing the Vision Pro <em>all the time</em>. At work! Doing laundry! Playing with their kids! The ambition is enormous: to layer apps and information over the real world — to augment reality.</p><p>Apple <em>has</em> to claim that the Vision Pro is the beginning of something new because people have been building headset computers for over a decade now. I <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?xs=1&amp;id=1025X1701640&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DLCB19lzAXS8">tried on a development prototype</a> of the first Oculus Rift in 2013, and<em> The Verge</em>’s Adi Robertson, who edited this review, has tried basically every headset that’s been released since. All of that development means there are some pretty good products out there: that first Oculus evolved into the Quest line at Meta, which is now shipping <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23906313/meta-quest-3-review-vr-mixed-reality-headset">the Quest 3</a> — a very good VR headset with a huge library of games and some AR features of its own, which costs $500.</p><p>In the meantime, Apple, from Tim Cook on down, has largely insisted that augmented reality will be <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21077484/apple-tim-cook-ar-augmented-reality">much more valuable than virtual reality</a>. And it’s been building toward AR for a long time: developers have access to AR tools in iOS, and higher-end iPhones and iPads have had lidar depth scanners for a few years now.</p><p>The Vision Pro is Apple’s first attempt at building a computer out of all those ideas — a computer that works in the space around you. The goal is for the Vision Pro to be a complete device that can sit right alongside the Mac and the iPad in Apple’s ecosystem of devices and let you get real work done. You can use Excel and Webex and Slack in the Vision Pro, and you can also sit back and watch movies and TV shows on a gigantic virtual 4K HDR display. And you can mirror your Mac’s display and just use the Vision Pro to look at a huge monitor floating in virtual space.</p><p>It sounds amazing, and sometimes it is. But the Vision Pro also represents a series of really big tradeoffs — tradeoffs that are impossible to ignore. Some of those tradeoffs are very tangible: getting all this tech in a headset means there’s a lot of weight on your face, so Apple chose to use an external battery pack connected by a cable. But there are other, more philosophical tradeoffs as well.&nbsp;</p><p>As I’ve been using it for the past few days, I kept coming up with a series of questions — questions about whether the tradeoffs were worth it.</p><p><em>Is using the Vision Pro so good that I’m willing to mess up my hair every time I put it on? </em></p><p><em>Is it so good that I want to lug it around in its giant carrying case instead of my laptop bag?</em></p><p><em>Is it so good that I want to look at the world around me through screens instead of with my own eyes?</em></p><p>Basically, I keep asking if I prefer using a computer <em>in there</em> rather than <em>out here</em>. And as interesting as the Vision Pro is, there’s a long way to go before it can beat <em>out here</em>.</p><div><div role="button" aria-label="Zoom" tabindex="0"><figure><div><p><span><img alt="A person wearing the Apple Vision Pro headset." loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" sizes="(max-width: 1023px) 100vw, 744px" srcset="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/376x251/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255225/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0166.jpg 376w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/384x256/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255225/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0166.jpg 384w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/415x277/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255225/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0166.jpg 415w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/480x320/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255225/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0166.jpg 480w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/540x360/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255225/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0166.jpg 540w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/640x427/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255225/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0166.jpg 640w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/750x500/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255225/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0166.jpg 750w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/828x552/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255225/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0166.jpg 828w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/1080x720/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255225/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0166.jpg 1080w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/1200x800/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255225/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0166.jpg 1200w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/1440x960/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255225/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0166.jpg 1440w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/1920x1280/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255225/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0166.jpg 1920w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/2048x1365/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255225/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0166.jpg 2048w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/2400x1600/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255225/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0166.jpg 2400w" src="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/2400x1600/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255225/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0166.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></span></p></div></figure></div><p><cite>Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge</cite></p></div><p><h3>Hardware</h3></p><p>Apple doesn’t want anyone to think of the Vision Pro as a VR headset, but it’s a VR headset — albeit a VR headset that <em>almost</em> lets you pretend it’s <em>not</em> a VR headset.&nbsp;</p><p>You put it on your head in a way that blocks out your vision entirely, and then it shows you a 3D video feed of the world around you passed through from the cameras on the front, as though you can see right through the device. But it can also put you in virtual reality, at various levels of immersion: I spent some time working entirely on the Moon and a lot of time in my kitchen with a bunch of windows floating around a portal into Joshua Tree.&nbsp;</p><div><p>Defining “reality” is a messy business in computing. The past decade has seen a dizzying race to come up with new words for what head-mounted displays do, including disagreement over what each one of these phrases means. So here’s our interpretation of a few terms used in the review:</p><p><strong>Augmented reality</strong>: virtual projections that are directly related to objects in the physical world, like an automatic translation of a restaurant menu or a virtual poster pinned to a real wall.</p><p><strong>Mixed reality</strong>: a computing system that mixes the virtual and physical without direct interaction between the two, like an app window floating in your living room.</p><p><strong>Virtual reality</strong>: a computing experience that immerses you in a fully virtual space, deliberately blocking out your perception of the physical world.</p></div><p>The Vision Pro is stunning compared to other VR headsets, which are largely plastic and often downright goofy-looking. The Vision Pro, by contrast, is built of magnesium and carbon fiber in an aluminum enclosure that feels like a natural extension of Apple’s familiar design language. There’s a little iPhone 6 in there, a little AirPods Max, a little Apple Watch. It is the cutting edge of technology in a package that seems instantly familiar. Almost everyone I’ve shown it to thinks it looks smaller in person than they expected, especially compared to some of the huge VR headsets we’ve seen over the past decade.</p><p>The front display on the Vision Pro is an attempt at keeping you from being isolated from other people while you’re wearing it. In Apple’s photos, it looks like a big, bright screen that shows a video of your eyes to people around you so they feel <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/2/24022803/apple-vision-pro-jony-ive-zoom-eyes-sunglasses-patent">comfortable talking to you</a> while you’re wearing the headset — a feature adorably called EyeSight. In reality, it might as well not be there. It’s a low-res OLED with a lenticular panel in front of it to provide a mild 3D effect, and it’s so dim and the cover glass is so reflective, it’s actually hard to see in most normal to bright lighting. When people <em>do</em> see your eyes, it’s a low-res, ghostly image of them that feels like CGI. The effect is uncanny — the idea that you’ll be making real eye contact with anyone is a fantasy. And there are no controls or indicators in visionOS for this external display, so you never really know what other people are seeing. Imagine looking someone directly in the eyes and talking to them <em>without knowing if they can see your eyes</em> — it’s weird!</p><div><div role="button" aria-label="Zoom" tabindex="0"><figure><div><p><span><img alt="Nilay Patel wears the Vision Pro, with the front display showing a faint image of his eyes." loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" sizes="(max-width: 1023px) 100vw, 744px" srcset="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/376x251/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255977/246965_vision_pro_AKrales_0002.jpg 376w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/384x256/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255977/246965_vision_pro_AKrales_0002.jpg 384w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/415x277/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255977/246965_vision_pro_AKrales_0002.jpg 415w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/480x320/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255977/246965_vision_pro_AKrales_0002.jpg 480w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/540x360/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255977/246965_vision_pro_AKrales_0002.jpg 540w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/640x427/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255977/246965_vision_pro_AKrales_0002.jpg 640w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/750x500/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255977/246965_vision_pro_AKrales_0002.jpg 750w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/828x552/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255977/246965_vision_pro_AKrales_0002.jpg 828w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/1080x720/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255977/246965_vision_pro_AKrales_0002.jpg 1080w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/1200x800/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255977/246965_vision_pro_AKrales_0002.jpg 1200w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/1440x960/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255977/246965_vision_pro_AKrales_0002.jpg 1440w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/1920x1280/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255977/246965_vision_pro_AKrales_0002.jpg 1920w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/2048x1365/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255977/246965_vision_pro_AKrales_0002.jpg 2048w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/2400x1600/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255977/246965_vision_pro_AKrales_0002.jpg 2400w" src="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/2400x1600/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255977/246965_vision_pro_AKrales_0002.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></span></p></div></figure></div><div><figcaption><em>EyeSight is so weird. So, so weird.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge</cite></p></div></div><p>That cover glass hides a huge array of cameras and sensors. There’s a pair of high-res front cameras for the video passthrough, cameras that face down and to the sides to track your hands, a lidar scanner and TrueDepth cameras for spatial tracking, and infrared floodlights so everything can work in low light. Underneath all <em>that,</em> you’ve got an M2 processor and Apple’s new R1 spatial coprocessor and a pair of fans to move the heat from all this tech out the top. The fans were never perceptible during my time testing the Vision Pro, but the heat was: after long sessions, the headset was definitely warm.</p><p>On the top edge, you’ll find what feel like larger versions of some familiar Apple Watch controls: a digital crown that adjusts both the volume and the level of virtual reality immersion on the right as you look through the headset and a button on the left that lets you take 3D photos and videos.</p><p>You get two headbands in the box: the solo knit band and the dual loop band. They both attach and detach easily; you snap them right on and then pull the little orange tab to disconnect them. The solo band is unquestionably cooler and messes up your hair slightly less — but they both mess up your hair, so if the dual loop fits you better, just go with it. I found the solo loop much more comfortable; I also wish the mounting points were on the outside face so I could pull the band around my head and clip it on instead of constantly pulling it over my hair.</p><div><div><div role="button" aria-label="Zoom" tabindex="0"><p><span><span></span><img alt="The front of the Vision Pro, covered in cameras and sensors" loading="lazy" decoding="async"

from space. I love it.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge</cite></p></div></div></div></div><p>The other two pieces are the light seal, which comes in various sizes, and the headband, which comes in two thicknesses. (You get fitted for these in the store or by scanning your head with an iPhone if you buy online.) Both attach magnetically, which means they also <em>detach</em> magnetically — you want to pick this thing up by the frame because grabbing it by the light seal can lead to disaster.</p><div><p>The idea that you’ll be making real eye contact with anyone while wearing the Vision Pro is a fantasy</p></div><p>If you have glasses, you can click in custom Zeiss lens inserts — Apple sent us reader lenses to see what that process looks like, but I just used the Vision Pro while wearing my soft contacts, and it was fine.</p><p>The Vision Pro’s speakers are housed in the arms on the side, and they are good and loud and do a convincing job of rendering spatial audio. Things really sound like they are happening where they appear to be happening, which is a neat trick. The speakers are also pretty leaky, so everyone else around you can hear what you’re up to unless you use headphones. You can use any Bluetooth headphones you want, but you get a bunch of extra features if you use the latest AirPods Pro, like lower latency, lossless 48KHz audio, and Apple’s Adaptive Audio system, which automatically mixes in sound from the real world as appropriate.</p><p>Since you’ll mostly experience the Vision Pro <em>in there</em>, the most noticeable thing about the hardware after a while is that it’s just… heavy. You’re supposed to wear this thing on your face for long stretches of computer time, and depending on which band and light seal you use, the headset alone weighs between 600 and 650 grams. I keep joking that the Vision Pro is an iPad for your face, but it’s heavier than an 11-inch iPad Pro (470 grams) and pushing close to a 12.9-inch iPad Pro (682 grams), so in a very real way, it’s an iPad for your face.</p><p>All of the Vision Pro’s heft is totally front-loaded, too. Other big headsets like the Quest Pro (722 grams) have elaborate headbands to balance out their weight, but the Vision Pro just rests it all on the front. Swapping to the dual loop strap helps keep things more stable but doesn’t really reduce the overall sensation of having all that headset on your face.

Apple told me that it chose to use an external battery specifically to reduce the headset’s weight. The battery itself is barely worth talking about — it’s a silver brick that weighs another 353 grams with a USB-C port and a motion-activated LED that’s green when it’s charged and orange when it’s not. It connects to the headset with a satisfying twist connector, but the nice braided cable is permanently attached to the battery itself, so don’t break it. You can buy extra batteries for $199, but you can’t hot-swap them; disconnecting the battery from the Vision Pro cuts the power entirely.</p><p>I don’t really have strong opinions on this battery setup, which is mostly because nothing about the Vision Pro feels like you’re supposed to move around that much in it, so it’s more or less fine. It’s funny that Apple of all companies shipped this compromise, but it’s also very Apple that the battery is not actually bigger so it can provide more than two and a half hours of run time. (If you plug the battery in, the Vision Pro just runs on wall power for as long as you want.)</p><p>Setting up the Vision Pro is dead simple — the headband adjustments are the only manual adjustments involved. Everything else is motorized and sensor-driven. There’s no fiddly lens wheel to dial in; the headset asks you to hold down the digital crown when you first put it on to adjust the lenses to your eyes, and then you go through a pretty standard eye tracking setup. The rest of the setup is almost exactly like any other iOS device: if you have an iPhone, you can bring it close to the Vision Pro to send over all your settings, and you have to agree to some terms and conditions. If you don’t have an iPhone, you’ll have to enter your passwords and so on manually, but it’ll work fine as a standalone device. After all of that, you’re computing in the future.</p><div><div role="button" aria-label="Zoom" tabindex="0"><figure><div><p><span><img alt="A photo of the inside of the Vision Pro, showing the lenses of the display." loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" sizes="(max-width: 1023px) 100vw, 744px" srcset="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/376x251/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255244/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0248.jpg 376w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/384x256/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255244/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0248.jpg 384w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/415x277/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255244/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0248.jpg 415w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/480x320/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255244/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0248.jpg 480w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/540x360/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255244/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0248.jpg 540w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/640x427/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255244/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0248.jpg 640w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/750x500/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255244/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0248.jpg 750w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/828x552/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255244/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0248.jpg 828w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/1080x720/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255244/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0248.jpg 1080w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/1200x800/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255244/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0248.jpg 1200w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/1440x960/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255244/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0248.jpg 1440w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/1920x1280/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255244/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0248.jpg 1920w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/2048x1365/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255244/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0248.jpg 2048w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/2400x1600/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255244/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0248.jpg 2400w" src="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/2400x1600/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255244/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0248.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></span></p></div></figure></div><div><figcaption><em>See? It’s a VR headset.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge</cite></p></div></div><p>Apple is very proud of the displays inside the Vision Pro, and for good reason — they represent a huge leap forward in display technology. The two displays are tiny MicroOLEDs with a total of 23 million pixels that are just 7.5 micrometers in size, which is about the size of a red blood cell. And each of <em>those</em> tiny pixels is composed of three RGB subpixels laid out in what Apple tells me is an S-stripe pattern. Just thinking about the level of precision required to make these displays and then make them work in a device like this is mind-blowing.&nbsp;</p><p>They also look generally incredible — sharp enough to read text on without even thinking about it, bright enough to do justice to movies. Apple calibrates them for color at the factory so they are also vibrant and color-accurate without looking oversaturated or blown out. They are <em>so</em> small, but they work <em>so</em> well that they seem huge.</p><p>The displays are the main reason the Vision Pro is so expensive — they’re at the heart of the Vision Pro experience and what makes the whole thing work. You are always looking at them, after all. But for all their technical marvels, they are not without tradeoffs of their own when deployed on a device like this.</p><div><div role="button" aria-label="Zoom" tabindex="0"><figure><div><p><span><img alt="A man wears the Vision Pro headset, photographed from the side, showing off the power cable and the speaker." loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" sizes="(max-width: 1023px) 100vw, 744px" srcset="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/376x251/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255223/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0153.jpg 376w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/384x256/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255223/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0153.jpg 384w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/415x277/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255223/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0153.jpg 415w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/480x320/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255223/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0153.jpg 480w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/540x360/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255223/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0153.jpg 540w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/640x427/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255223/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0153.jpg 640w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/750x500/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255223/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0153.jpg 750w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/828x552/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255223/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0153.jpg 828w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/1080x720/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255223/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0153.jpg 1080w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/1200x800/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255223/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0153.jpg 1200w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/1440x960/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255223/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0153.jpg 1440w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/1920x1280/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255223/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0153.jpg 1920w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/2048x1365/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255223/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0153.jpg 2048w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/2400x1600/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255223/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0153.jpg 2400w" src="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/2400x1600/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255223/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0153.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></span></p></div></figure></div><div><figcaption><em>The speakers are nice and loud and convincing with spatial audio.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge</cite></p></div></div><p>See <em>this</em> thing — a passthrough VR headset with a silly external battery pack and a display that shows ghostly images of your eyes on the front — is not the big goal. The big goal is AR, or augmented reality. In particular, the big goal is <em>optical</em> AR, where light passes directly through unobtrusive glasses to your eyes, with digital information layered over the top of what you’re seeing. AR is a technology with the potential to literally change humanity, and Apple CEO Tim Cook has been talking about how isolating VR headsets are and how important he thinks AR will be for years now.&nbsp;</p><div><ul><li>Tim Cook, <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2016/10/02/tim-cook-talks-steve-jobs-need-for-encryption-at-utah-tech-tour-video/">2016</a>: “Few people are going to view that it’s acceptable to be enclosed in something.”</li><li>Tim Cook, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/features/apple-tim-cook-boss-brexit-uk-theresa-may-number-10-interview-ustwo-a7574086.html">2017</a>: “Unlike Virtual Reality which closes the world out, AR allows individuals to be present in the world.”</li><li>Tim Cook, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-41590323">2017</a>: “I also like the fact that [AR] doesn’t isolate [...] I’ve never been a fan of VR like that because I think it does the opposite.”</li><li>Tim Cook, <a href="https://www.siliconrepublic.com/machines/tim-cook-ar-war-ducks-healthtech">2020</a>: “I think [AR is] something that doesn’t isolate people. We can use it to enhance our discussion, not substitute it for human connection, which I’ve always deeply worried about in some of the other technologies.”</li></ul></div><p>You get the idea.</p><p>The problem is that the technology to build a true optical AR display that works well enough to replace an everyday computer just isn’t there yet. The Magic Leap 2 is an optical AR headset that’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/12/23205702/magic-leap-2-enterprise-release-price-shipping-date-mixed-reality-ar-headset">cheaper and smaller</a> than the Vision Pro, but it’s plagued by compromises in field of view and image quality that most people would never accept.&nbsp;</p><p>So Apple’s settled for building a headset with real-time video passthrough — it is the defining tradeoff of the Vision Pro. It is a VR headset masquerading as an AR headset. And let me tell you: the video passthrough on the Vision Pro is <em>really good</em>. It works! It’s convincing. You put the headset on, the display comes on, and you’re right back where you were, only with a bunch of visionOS windows floating around.&nbsp;</p><p>It sounds simple, but it is an astonishing engineering achievement to do that in real time, at high resolution, in a computer that fits over your eyes. Apple claims there’s only 12ms of latency between what the cameras see and what’s on the display, and that latency includes the exposure time of the cameras themselves. The actual data processing is <em>faster</em>. Do the math, and Apple says there’s not even a frame’s worth of latency; the next frame of video is ready before you’re done looking at the last one.</p><div><div role="button" aria-label="Zoom" tabindex="0"><figure><div><p><span><img alt="The Vision Pro headset, photographed so that you can see the cameras on the front." loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" sizes="(max-width: 1023px) 100vw, 744px" srcset="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/376x251/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255229/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0194.jpg 376w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/384x256/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255229/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0194.jpg 384w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/415x277/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255229/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0194.jpg 415w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/480x320/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255229/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0194.jpg 480w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/540x360/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255229/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0194.jpg 540w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/640x427/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255229/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0194.jpg 640w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/750x500/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255229/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0194.jpg 750w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/828x552/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255229/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0194.jpg 828w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/1080x720/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255229/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0194.jpg 1080w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/1200x800/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255229/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0194.jpg 1200w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/1440x960/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255229/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0194.jpg 1440w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/1920x1280/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255229/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0194.jpg 1920w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/2048x1365/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255229/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0194.jpg 2048w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/2400x1600/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255229/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0194.jpg 2400w" src="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/2400x1600/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255229/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0194.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></span></p></div></figure></div><div><figcaption><em>Still cameras, still displays.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge</cite></p></div></div><p>You can also see Apple’s incredible video processing chops right in front of your eyes: I sat around scrolling on my phone while wearing the Vision Pro, with no blown-out screens or weird frame rate issues. I also worked on my Mac in front of a large window while wearing the headset, which is a torture test for dynamic range, and while it wasn’t perfect, it was still usable. It is the best video passthrough that’s ever shipped in a consumer device by far.</p><div><p>If you want me to perceive reality through something, I’d like to see all the colors of the rainbow</p></div><p>The problem is that cameras are still cameras, and displays are still displays. All cameras have motion blur, for example. In low light, cameras either have to increase exposure times at the cost of sharpness or increase ISO at the cost of noise, which then requires noise reduction, which makes things blurry and dull. And cameras and displays both have real limits in terms of color reproduction.</p><p>The Vision Pro cannot overcome the inherent nature of cameras and displays. You can easily see motion blur when you move your head in the Vision Pro — motion blur that increases in low light and leads to some weird warping of straight lines. Low light also causes the overall sharpness of the video passthrough to drop as noise reduction kicks in: my iPhone screen got noticeably blurrier when the sun set. </p><p>If you’re in a medium-lit room halfway immersed in a dark virtual environment with a bright window open — say, sitting in your kitchen at night with the lights on while writing a review in a Google Docs&nbsp;window floating on a dark beach — you will notice the display brightness slowly ramp up and down as the system tries to average out the brightness of everything you’re looking at. The LCD clock on my microwave flickers when I look at it through these cameras. And Apple’s specs say the display supports 92 percent of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DCI-P3">DCI-P3 color gamut</a>, which means the Vision Pro can only show you 49 percent of the colors your eyes can actually see.</p><div><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><span>Video</span><p><figcaption><span>The vision pro's video passthrough did not like the clock on my microwave.</span></figcaption></p></figure>

</div><p>The displays have other limitations: the field of view isn’t huge, and the essential nature of looking at tiny displays through lenses makes that field of view feel even smaller. Apple won’t tell me the exact number, but the Vision Pro’s field of view is certainly smaller than the Quest 3’s 110 horizontal degrees. That means there are fairly large black borders around what you’re seeing, a bit like you’re looking through binoculars.&nbsp;</p><p>On top of that, there’s a little bit of distortion and vignetting around the edges of the lenses, and you’ll see some green and pink color fringing at the edges as well, especially in bright environments. All of this makes the usable field of view feel even smaller. If you’re looking at something bright or otherwise high contrast — a white text window floating above a dark desert landscape, for example — you’ll see highlights reflecting in the lenses.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>A screen capture from the Vision Pro and a simulated view of what it feels like to look in the headset.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>I asked Apple about all of this, and yep — that’s how it’s supposed to look. Apple spokesperson Jacqueline Roy told me that a combination of hardware and software in the Vision Pro is specifically designed to minimize these various effects, but they’re definitely in there, and you’ll see them.</p><div><p>You’re constantly being reminded that you’re looking at video on screens, and reality is a lot more interesting than that</p></div><p>If you have been paying attention to VR for the past decade, you know that these are very familiar VR headset display issues. You’re passing light from a screen through lenses mounted on someone’s face and trying to line those lenses up with their eyes, which are notably in different spots on different people’s faces. (Our bodies are designed very badly when it comes to mounting hardware on them.) So a little weirdness at the edges of the displays is not a deal-breaker or even a surprise — except Apple is charging $3,499 for the Vision Pro and making it sound like these displays are perfect enough for you to casually wear this thing while folding laundry.&nbsp;</p><p>I’m serious when I say the Vision Pro has the best video passthrough I’ve ever seen on the sharpest VR displays any normal person will ever come across. But you’re still constantly being reminded that you’re looking at video on screens, and reality is just a lot more interesting than that. There are vanishingly few contexts in reviewing consumer devices where anyone has to care about color gamuts — but if you want me to perceive reality through something, I’d like to see all the colors of the rainbow.</p><p>This is the best anyone has ever made <em>in there</em> look, and it’s still not nearly as good as <em>out here.</em></p><div><div role="button" aria-label="Zoom" tabindex="0"><figure><div><p><span><img alt="The Vision Pro sitting next to its battery." loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" sizes="(max-width: 1023px) 100vw, 744px" srcset="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/376x251/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255195/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0034.jpg 376w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/384x256/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255195/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0034.jpg 384w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/415x277/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255195/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0034.jpg 415w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/480x320/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255195/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0034.jpg 480w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/540x360/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255195/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0034.jpg 540w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/640x427/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255195/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0034.jpg 640w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/750x500/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255195/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0034.jpg 750w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/828x552/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255195/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0034.jpg 828w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/1080x720/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255195/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0034.jpg 1080w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/1200x800/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255195/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0034.jpg 1200w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/1440x960/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255195/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0034.jpg 1440w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/1920x1280/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255195/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0034.jpg 1920w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/2048x1365/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255195/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0034.jpg 2048w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/2400x1600/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255195/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0034.jpg 2400w" src="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/2400x1600/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255195/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0034.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></span></p></div></figure></div><div><figcaption><em>Waiting.

You look at things you want to control, you tap your fingers to control them, and that’s how you get around the entire interface. You’re not reaching out and touching things — it’s more like your eyes are the mouse, and your fingers are the button: you tap them together to click on what you’re looking at.</p><p>The first few times you use hand and eye tracking on the Vision Pro, it’s awe-inspiring — it feels like a superpower. The Vision Pro’s external cameras just need to see your hands for it to work, and they can see your hands in a pretty large zone around your body. You can have them slung across the back of the couch, resting in your lap, up in the air with your elbows on a table, pretty much anywhere the cameras can see them. It actually takes a minute to realize you don’t have to gesture out in front of you with your hands in the air — and once you figure it out, it’s pretty fun to watch other people instinctively reach their hands up the first time they try the Vision Pro.</p><p>But the next few times you use hand and eye tracking, it stops feeling like a superpower — and in some cases, it actively makes using the Vision Pro harder. It turns out that having to <em>look at what you want to control</em> is really quite distracting.</p><p>Think about every other computer in your life: the input mechanism is independent of whatever you’re looking at. On a laptop, you can click on controls and use the keyboard while keeping your focus on a document. On a phone, you can do things like drag sliders in a photo editing app while keeping your eyes focused on what those changes are actually doing to your photo.</p><p>The Vision Pro simply doesn’t work like that — you have to be looking at something in order to click on it, and that means you are constantly taking your attention away from whatever you’re working on to specifically look at the button you need to press next. I spent some time playing a lovely little game called <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?xs=1&amp;id=1025X1701640&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fapps.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Fstitch%2Fid1581052096"><em>Stitch</em></a><em> t</em>hat quickly became maddening because I kept looking away from the piece I wanted to move to the place I wanted to move it, which meant I wasn’t picking it up when I tapped my fingers.</p><div><div role="button" aria-label="Zoom" tabindex="0"><figure><div><p><span><img alt="Nilay Patel reaches into the air while wearing the Vision Pro" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" sizes="(max-width: 1023px) 100vw, 744px" srcset="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/376x251/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255206/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0075.jpg 376w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/384x256/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255206/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0075.jpg 384w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/415x277/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255206/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0075.jpg 415w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/480x320/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255206/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0075.jpg 480w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/540x360/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255206/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0075.jpg 540w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/640x427/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255206/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0075.jpg 640w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/750x500/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255206/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0075.jpg 750w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/828x552/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255206/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0075.jpg 828w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/1080x720/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255206/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0075.jpg 1080w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/1200x800/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255206/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0075.jpg 1200w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/1440x960/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255206/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0075.jpg 1440w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/1920x1280/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255206/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0075.jpg 1920w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/2048x1365/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255206/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0075.jpg 2048w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/2400x1600/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255206/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0075.jpg 2400w" src="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/2400x1600/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255206/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0075.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></span></p></div></figure></div><div><figcaption><em>Reach out and touch faith.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge</cite></p></div></div><p>visionOS feels also designed for an eye tracking system that’s just slightly more precise than it actually is — a lot of controls are just a little too small and a little too close together to let you quickly bop around the system. You have to look, make <em>sure</em> you’re looking at the thing you want, and <em>then</em> tap, or you might end up clicking on the wrong thing. Sometimes the fastest way to select what you want is to look away entirely and try again.</p><p>It works until it doesn’t. It’s magic until it’s not.</p><p>Think about it like this: The keyboard and mouse on a Mac <em>directly</em> control the Mac. The click wheel on an iPod directly controlled the iPod. A lot of work has gone into making it feel like the multitouch screen on an iPhone <em>directly</em> controls the phone, and when it goes sideways, like when autocorrect fails or an app doesn’t register your taps, it’s not pleasant.</p><p>Your eyes and hands <em>aren’t</em> directly controlling the Vision Pro: cameras are <em>watching</em> your eyes and hands and turning <em>that</em> into input, and sometimes the interpretation isn’t perfect. The best example of this is the hilarious on-screen keyboard, which you use by staring at each letter and pinching your fingers to select it or henpecking with two fingers at the floating keys in front of you. It’s not worth using for anything beyond entering a Wi-Fi password — for anything longer, you’ll want to use dictation or connect a Bluetooth keyboard. Why? So you can directly control the input.</p><p>It’s not a given that the Vision Pro can always see your hands, either. There’s a pretty large bubble around the front of your body where the cameras can see your hands — it basically extends the length of your arms in a semicircle around the front of your body. But if you lean back in a chair with your arm at your side, it can’t see your hand. If you’re sitting at a table and your hands are on your legs, it might not see your hands. If you’re lying down in a dark room and the IR illuminators can’t reach your hands, the cameras might not be able to see them. If you’re simply standing up with your arms at your sides, it might not be able to see your hands if they drift too far backward.</p><div><div role="button" aria-label="Zoom" tabindex="0"><figure><div><p><span><img alt="A photo of a man wearing the Vision Pro, taken from the side." loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" sizes="(max-width: 1023px) 100vw, 744px" srcset="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/376x251/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255200/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0050.jpg 376w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/384x256/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255200/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0050.jpg 384w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/415x277/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255200/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0050.jpg 415w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/480x320/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255200/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0050.jpg 480w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/540x360/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255200/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0050.jpg 540w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/640x427/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255200/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0050.jpg 640w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/750x500/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255200/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0050.jpg 750w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/828x552/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255200/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0050.jpg 828w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/1080x720/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255200/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0050.jpg 1080w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/1200x800/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255200/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0050.jpg 1200w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/1440x960/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255200/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0050.jpg 1440w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/1920x1280/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255200/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0050.jpg 1920w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/2048x1365/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255200/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0050.jpg 2048w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/2400x1600/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255200/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0050.jpg 2400w" src="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/2400x1600/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255200/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0050.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></span></p></div></figure></div><p><cite>Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>I recognize that it is fundamentally silly to complain about a hand tracking system needing to see your hands, and it <em>is</em> possible to navigate quite a lot of visionOS with Siri and dictation: you can manage apps, open different virtual immersions, and so on. If you squint, you can see a glimpse of how a computer that you use by talking to it and manipulating things in space might one day work.&nbsp;</p><p>But right now, the limits are obvious. Using the Vision Pro makes you constantly aware of what you are looking at and where your hands are in a way that is unlike any other computer I’ve ever used. When it fails, it’s maddening. (Oddly, Apple’s newest watches <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23928706/double-tap-apple-watch-series-9-ultra-2">can detect a pinching gesture</a>, but there’s no ability to use those as control devices on the Vision Pro.)</p><p>The flip side is that a system that’s constantly watching your hands for input tends to register a lot of extra inputs, which can be very funny. I talk through writing video scripts to make sure things flow, and I talk with my hands. So as I was writing the video script for this review in the Vision Pro, the system kept catching my hands moving and started scrolling and clicking on things by accident. I cracked up the first time I realized what was happening. But eventually, it meant that I took the Vision Pro off and wrote the rest of the script on my Mac, which only does things when I actually want it to.</p><p>Just as with the displays, I think this is the best eye and hand tracking system anyone’s ever shipped. It really can feel like magic… until it doesn’t. And if you want people to do their computing <em>in there</em>, the input system needs to be absolutely rock solid.</p><p><h3>Personas</h3></p><p>I won’t go into that much detail on Apple’s deeply weird and extremely uncanny 3D persona system here — the best way to understand them is by watching the video review above, which features a FaceTime call between <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>’s Joanna Stern, Marques Brownlee, and me, all using our personas. To quote Marques, personas are really impressive and also really bad. You can see why Apple put the beta label on them; there’s a long way to go before using a persona on a call isn’t distracting at best and, at worst, extremely rude.</p><div><div><div role="button"

Home.</em></figcaption></p></div></div><p>One small note: personas can show up whenever an app calls for a front-facing camera, so they work in basically everything. I used mine on a Google Meet call in Safari just fine, although the other people on the Meet call did not think it was fine at all.</p><p><h3>Spatial cameras</h3></p><p>I would not recommend shooting photos in the Vision Pro unless you really need to. Pressing the shutter button a single time delivers a 2560 x 2560 still, which works out to 6.5 megapixels. As far as I can tell, it’s always from the left main camera, which the EXIF data says has an 18mm f/2.0 lens. The photos look like 6.5-megapixel photos from a tiny camera sensor optimized for video, which is to say that they look pretty bad.</p><p>Video is slightly better — the Vision Pro shoots 2200 x 2200 square videos at 30fps. They look a little better than the photos, but there’s still an awful lot of compression going on, and if you happen to watch them on anything but a Vision Pro, you’ll notice some barrel distortion as the camera moves around. None of this feels particularly important: I really can’t think of situations where I’d want to be taking video with the headset on since all these videos and screen captures come with a ton of excess motion from your head moving around. Also, you will look fundamentally ridiculous trying to take photos of your family with this thing on your face. I think it’s fair to assume most Vision Pro buyers also own iPhones, which take great videos, so whatever.</p><p>One thing that <em>is</em> very convincing is taking spatial videos on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23879619/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-review">the iPhone 15 Pro Max</a> and watching them in 3D on the Vision Pro. I took some videos of my daughter at the zoo and around Christmas time, and like any dad, I could probably watch them over and over again forever. They play back in a sort of ghostly white haze, and the overall effect is incredibly bittersweet — you can relive a brief memory, but you’re alone in the headset and can’t share it with anyone else. The other problem is that, currently, you can choose to shoot iPhone video in spatial in 1080p at 30fps or at the full 4K resolution the phone supports but not both. For now, I’m going to stick with the higher-res video, but there’s going to come a time where shooting in spatial by default is the smart move, and that will be a real turning point.</p><p><h3>visionOS</h3></p><p>The Vision Pro runs visionOS, which Apple says is based on iPadOS, with a lot of customization around latency and vision to make it work for spatial computing. Starting with the iPad as a foundation represents an incredible head start for Apple — it’s taken years for Meta to build out all the features of the Android-based Quest OS and populate its app store, and it’s still mostly games. Apple gets to start with the full set of mature iPadOS features and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/18/24043367/apple-vision-pro-apps-good-bad">most of the huge iPad app library</a>.</p><p>It’s funny to keep saying that the Vision Pro is an iPad for your face, but when it comes to the current set of apps, it’s also not totally wrong. Most of them work like iPad apps, and the homescreen comes preloaded with a folder labeled “compatible apps” that’s full of actual iPad apps. It’s hard to judge the app ecosystem for a product that has barely launched, but I feel totally comfortable judging the iPad app ecosystem at this point, and Apple shipping its own podcast and news apps as iPad apps on the Vision Pro feels like a sign in a lot of ways.</p><div><div role="button" aria-label="Zoom" tabindex="0"><figure><div><p><span><img alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" sizes="(max-width: 1023px) 100vw, 744px" srcset="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/376x251/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255245/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0252.jpg 376w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/384x256/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255245/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0252.jpg 384w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/415x277/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255245/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0252.jpg 415w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/480x320/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255245/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0252.jpg 480w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/540x360/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255245/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0252.jpg 540w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/640x427/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255245/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0252.jpg 640w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/750x500/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255245/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0252.jpg 750w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/828x552/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255245/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0252.jpg 828w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/1080x720/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255245/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0252.jpg 1080w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/1200x800/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255245/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0252.jpg 1200w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/1440x960/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255245/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0252.jpg 1440w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/1920x1280/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255245/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0252.jpg 1920w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/2048x1365/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255245/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0252.jpg 2048w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/2400x1600/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255245/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0252.jpg 2400w" src="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/2400x1600/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255245/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0252.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></span></p></div></figure></div><p><cite>Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>There’s already <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/23/23804704/netflix-vision-pro-native-app-apple-ios-ipad-os">controversy in the world of Vision Pro apps</a>: some huge developers like Netflix, Spotify, and YouTube have decided to wait before allowing their apps to run on the Vision Pro and aren’t even allowing their iPad apps to run. As always, the open web serves as the pressure release valve for Apple developer politics, and Safari on the Vision Pro is a capable riff on iPad Safari: I watched Netflix in Safari and it worked without a hitch, although you can’t put the video in a nice environment like you can with the native apps. I also watched the NFL playoffs on YouTube TV in Safari on the Vision Pro, and it worked with a few minor hiccups, although it did keep asking me to confirm my location over and over again.</p><p>The stranger thing is that Safari on the Vision Pro is pretty disconnected from web-based 3D experiences. Apple has made noise about supporting the WebXR standard, and there are flags in Safari’s advanced preferences to turn on support, but it’s pretty hit-or-miss in terms of actually working right now — it mostly does not.</p><p>I asked about this, and Apple told me that it is actively contributing to WebXR and wants to “work with the community to help deliver great spatial computing experiences via the web.” So let’s give that one a minute and see how it goes.</p><p>On the other hand, I asked Apple why the huge library of VR video on YouTube doesn’t work at all on the Vision Pro, and the company basically told me it wasn’t good enough to support, saying that “much of this content was created for devices that do not deliver a high-quality spatial experience” and that the company’s efforts were instead focused on “delivering the best spatial media experience possible including spatial photos and videos, Apple Immersive Video, and 3D movies available on Apple TV.”</p><p>Translation: don’t hold your breath for YouTube VR support.</p><div><div role="button" aria-label="Zoom" tabindex="0"><figure><div><p><span><img alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" sizes="(max-width: 1023px) 100vw, 744px" srcset="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/376x251/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255983/246965_vision_pro_AKrales_0108.jpg 376w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/384x256/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255983/246965_vision_pro_AKrales_0108.jpg 384w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/415x277/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255983/246965_vision_pro_AKrales_0108.jpg 415w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/480x320/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255983/246965_vision_pro_AKrales_0108.jpg 480w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/540x360/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255983/246965_vision_pro_AKrales_0108.jpg 540w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/640x427/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255983/246965_vision_pro_AKrales_0108.jpg 640w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/750x500/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255983/246965_vision_pro_AKrales_0108.jpg 750w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/828x552/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255983/246965_vision_pro_AKrales_0108.jpg 828w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/1080x720/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255983/246965_vision_pro_AKrales_0108.jpg 1080w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/1200x800/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255983/246965_vision_pro_AKrales_0108.jpg 1200w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/1440x960/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255983/246965_vision_pro_AKrales_0108.jpg 1440w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/1920x1280/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255983/246965_vision_pro_AKrales_0108.jpg 1920w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/2048x1365/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255983/246965_vision_pro_AKrales_0108.jpg 2048w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/2400x1600/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255983/246965_vision_pro_AKrales_0108.jpg 2400w" src="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/2400x1600/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255983/246965_vision_pro_AKrales_0108.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></span></p></div></figure></div><p><cite>Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>The really big difference between visionOS and iPadOS is that iPadOS has a lot of opinions about how you can arrange apps and how many apps you can run at a time, and visionOS is full-on free-floating window chaos. I love it. It is bananas.</p><p>You can open as many apps as you want and put them anywhere you want in space. You can open windows in the kitchen, walk away from them and open some more in the living room, and then go back to the kitchen to find all your old windows waiting for you. Late one night, I made an art gallery of giant Safari windows in our office’s large open cafe area and walked around, looking at huge webpages for a while. I am telling you, it is <em>wild</em>.</p><p>Sadly, visionOS doesn’t have any ability to share these windows or experiences with anyone else: two people in Vision Pro headsets sitting in the same room can’t see the same things floating in space at the same time. Apple tells me some enterprise developers are working on experiences with shared views, and you can mirror the view from one Vision Pro to another over FaceTime, but in the end, my big Safari art gallery only ever had one patron: me. It’s amazing you can do all of this, but it is also quite lonely to put things all over a space knowing no one else will ever really experience it.</p><div><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><span>Video</span><p><figcaption><span>You can put windows anywhere you want — I love it.</span></figcaption></p></figure>

</div><p>To move windows around, you just grab the bar at the bottom and put it wherever you want to in space. You can layer windows, you can put them directly above your head, you can put them on the floor — you can really just do whatever you want. To switch between them, you just look at the window you want and tap your fingers; inactive windows go slightly translucent, which means all kinds of things can be happening at once all over your space.</p><p>On top of <em>that</em>, you can have apps from three different operating systems on-screen at the same time: native visionOS apps; iPad apps; and then you can also connect your Mac via Wi-Fi and have a whole Mac display with all the chaotic glory of macOS floating around in space.&nbsp;</p><p>One area where visionOS has clear room to improve is window management. There’s no Exposé or Stage Manager to collect all your open windows in front of you or put them into preset arrangements, and the management that does exist is not exactly discoverable or intuitively laid out. You can tap and hold the X button in one app to hide all your <em>other</em> apps. If you want to hide <em>everything</em>, you double-click the digital crown on the headset itself. If you want to <em>close</em> all apps, you just ask Siri; if you want to <em>quit</em> a misbehaving app, you hold down the top button and the digital crown simultaneously to bring up a force quit window. It’s a lot of different ideas all at once.</p><p>Once you figure out the moves, you can get around, but it takes a minute, and it means you’ll be thinking about window management more than any other iOS device I can think of and maybe even more than a Mac, which has four decades of window management ideas built into it.</p><div><div role="button" aria-label="Zoom" tabindex="0"><figure><div><p><span><img alt="A person wearing a Vision Pro headset." loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" sizes="(max-width: 1023px) 100vw, 744px" srcset="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/376x251/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255979/246965_vision_pro_AKrales_0015.jpg 376w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/384x256/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255979/246965_vision_pro_AKrales_0015.jpg 384w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/415x277/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255979/246965_vision_pro_AKrales_0015.jpg 415w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/480x320/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255979/246965_vision_pro_AKrales_0015.jpg 480w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/540x360/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255979/246965_vision_pro_AKrales_0015.jpg 540w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/640x427/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255979/246965_vision_pro_AKrales_0015.jpg 640w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/750x500/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255979/246965_vision_pro_AKrales_0015.jpg 750w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/828x552/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255979/246965_vision_pro_AKrales_0015.jpg 828w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/1080x720/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255979/246965_vision_pro_AKrales_0015.jpg 1080w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/1200x800/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255979/246965_vision_pro_AKrales_0015.jpg 1200w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/1440x960/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255979/246965_vision_pro_AKrales_0015.jpg 1440w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/1920x1280/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255979/246965_vision_pro_AKrales_0015.jpg 1920w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/2048x1365/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255979/246965_vision_pro_AKrales_0015.jpg 2048w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/2400x1600/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255979/246965_vision_pro_AKrales_0015.jpg 2400w" src="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/2400x1600/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255979/246965_vision_pro_AKrales_0015.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></span></p></div></figure></div><p><cite>Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>Speaking of the Mac, I know a lot of people are excited about the idea of buying a Vision Pro just to put up giant virtual monitors. There’s good news and bad news about that. The good news is that Mac display sharing works really well, and Apple ecosystem tricks like Handoff and Continuity are pure magic in this context. You can copy on your Mac and paste in visionOS, and it just works. You can open your Mac display in visionOS and drag the mouse off the screen, and suddenly, your Mac’s keyboard and trackpad are controlling visionOS apps. It works just like it does between a Mac and an iPad. I found myself putting a virtual Mac display over my MacBook Pro’s screen and making it look like I had a 50-inch laptop to use Lightroom with — it’s awesome.</p><p>There is a lot of very complicated display scaling going on behind the scenes here, but the easiest way to think about it is that you’re basically getting a 27-inch Retina display, like you’d find on an iMac or Studio Display. Your Mac <em>thinks</em> it’s connected to a 5K display with a resolution of 5120 x 2880, and it runs macOS at a 2:1 logical resolution of 2560 x 1440, just like a 5K display. (You can pick other resolutions, but the device warns you that they’ll be lower quality.) That virtual display is then streamed as a 4K 3560 x 2880 video to the Vision Pro, where you can just make it as big as you want. The upshot of all of this is that 4K content runs at a native 4K resolution — it has all the pixels to do it, just like an iMac — but you have a grand total of 2560 x 1440 to place windows in, regardless of how big you make the Mac display in space, and you’re not seeing a pixel-perfect 5K image.</p><p>It is incredible that all of this works with just a single button click, but all that scaling complication also explains the bad news: you can only have a single Mac display in visionOS. You can’t have multiple Mac monitors floating in space. Maybe next time.</p><div><div role="button" aria-label="Zoom" tabindex="0"><figure><div><p><span><img alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" sizes="(max-width: 1023px) 100vw, 744px" srcset="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/376x251/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255247/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0265.jpg 376w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/384x256/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255247/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0265.jpg 384w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/415x277/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255247/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0265.jpg 415w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/480x320/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255247/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0265.jpg 480w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/540x360/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255247/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0265.jpg 540w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/640x427/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255247/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0265.jpg 640w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/750x500/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255247/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0265.jpg 750w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/828x552/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255247/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0265.jpg 828w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/1080x720/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255247/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0265.jpg 1080w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/1200x800/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255247/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0265.jpg 1200w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/1440x960/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255247/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0265.jpg 1440w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/1920x1280/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255247/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0265.jpg 1920w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/2048x1365/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255247/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0265.jpg 2048w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/2400x1600/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255247/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0265.jpg 2400w" src="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/2400x1600/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255247/246965_vision_pro_VPavic_0265.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></span></p></div></figure></div><p><cite>Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>One of the weirder things about visionOS (and the Vision Pro itself, really) is that there’s not a lot of true AR in the mix — as in, actual interaction between physical objects in your space and digital ones.&nbsp;</p><p>After all these years of Apple talking about AR, I counted exactly three things in my entire time with the Vision Pro that offered a preview of the AR future. One: when you look at your Mac, the Vision Pro sometimes puts up a “connect display” button above it that starts screen sharing. Two: when you’re typing on a Bluetooth keyboard and look down at your hands, it puts a little text preview window above the keyboard so you can see what you’re typing. These are little features, yes, but they are some of the first true AR computing features that have ever shipped on a mainstream device, and they are an incredibly tantalizing glimpse of what might be possible. They also happen to be incredibly useful.</p><p>The third AR thing I saw was the loading screen of <em>Super Fruit Ninja</em>, which allows you to throw a strawberry at a pig that’s running around on your floor. This seems slightly less historic.</p><p>That’s more or less it. There’s not a lot of reality being augmented in the rest of visionOS. There’s an awful lot of what you might call mixed reality: virtual objects floating around in space with no connection to anything real. All those app windows floating around are doing so independently of the physical environment. And in the entertainment context, where Apple lets the Vision Pro fall back into being the VR headset it fundamentally is, it absolutely shines.</p><p>Watching movies on the Vision Pro is a ton of fun, especially in the Apple TV app’s immersive movie theater that lets you pick where you want to sit. It’s also very cool to watch a movie in one of Apple’s virtual environments like Mount Hood and see the colors from the screen reflect onto the landscape or look around one of the Disney Plus environments like Avengers Tower. And movies themselves look great — the incredible quality of the Vision Pro’s displays is really obvious when you’re watching something. I watched far more of <em>Top Gun: Maverick</em> than I intended to just because it looked so good blown up to drive-in movie size, floating over a mountain.</p><div><div role="button" aria-label="Zoom" tabindex="0"><figure><div><p><span><img alt="A woman makes a pinching gesture while wearing the Vision Pro." loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" sizes="(max-width: 1023px) 100vw, 744px" srcset="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/376x251/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255988/246965_vision_pro_AKrales_0140.jpg 376w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/384x256/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255988/246965_vision_pro_AKrales_0140.jpg 384w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/415x277/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255988/246965_vision_pro_AKrales_0140.jpg 415w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/480x320/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255988/246965_vision_pro_AKrales_0140.jpg 480w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/540x360/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255988/246965_vision_pro_AKrales_0140.jpg 540w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/640x427/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255988/246965_vision_pro_AKrales_0140.jpg 640w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/750x500/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255988/246965_vision_pro_AKrales_0140.jpg 750w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/828x552/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255988/246965_vision_pro_AKrales_0140.jpg 828w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/1080x720/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255988/246965_vision_pro_AKrales_0140.jpg 1080w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/1200x800/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255988/246965_vision_pro_AKrales_0140.jpg 1200w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/1440x960/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255988/246965_vision_pro_AKrales_0140.jpg 1440w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/1920x1280/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255988/246965_vision_pro_AKrales_0140.jpg 1920w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/2048x1365/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255988/246965_vision_pro_AKrales_0140.jpg 2048w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/2400x1600/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255988/246965_vision_pro_AKrales_0140.jpg 2400w" src="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/2400x1600/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255988/246965_vision_pro_AKrales_0140.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></span></p></div></figure></div><p><cite>Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>Since the Vision Pro sends separate images to each eye, it can do true 3D movies — and Apple and its partners like Disney have already released quite a few. If you have a large Apple movie library, you get the 3D versions for free — you just choose 2D or 3D playback when you hit play. Apple is also making immersive versions of some of its Apple TV Plus shows, which basically means a 180ish-degree 3D video that feels like the best Google Cardboard demo of all time. I watched someone walk a tightrope in <em>Adventure</em>, and it was very convincing — but if you’ve never tried this before, I’d be careful that you get used to VR motion before diving into 3D videos. Apple has also promised immersive sports content, but sadly, I wasn’t able to try any of that yet.</p><p>You can get pretty far making the argument that the Vision Pro is worth it simply as a very expensive TV — but after a while, the weight of it reminds you that this very nice TV is resting on your face. (I usually made it about 30 minutes to an hour before wanting a break.) It’s also a very expensive TV that doesn’t have HDMI inputs, so you’re limited to Apple’s gaming library, which feels deeply unfair. And unlike any other TV in your life, the Vision Pro can literally DRM your eyes — if you’re watching a movie in the Apple TV app or Disney Plus and go to take a screen capture, the content blacks out. It’s strange to experience a reality where big companies can block you from capturing what you see, even if all you’re trying to do is show people how cool it looks in a review. You can get around DRM screenshots on an iPhone by just taking a photo of the screen, but there’s no such off-ramp for the Vision Pro.&nbsp;</p><div><p>Speaking of gaming, there aren’t any real VR games or fitness apps here — there’s nothing like <em>Beat Saber</em> or <em>Red Matter</em> or <em>Population: One</em>, all hit games on the Quest. Fitness, in particular, has helped the Quest reach a more mainstream market: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22379859/vr-virtual-reality-fitness-work-out-supernatural-chris-milk-interview">Supernatural’s Chris Milk told me in 2021</a> that his user base is 50 / 50 men and women, 60 percent of whom are over 40. That led to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/1/23575041/meta-within-vr-acquisition-ftc-antitrust-lawsuit-injunction-denied">Meta buying Supernatural outright</a> because <a href="https://mixed-news.com/en/meta-wanted-to-beat-apple-to-the-punch-buying-supernatural/">it was worried about Apple buying it first</a>.</p></div><div><p>You can get pretty far making the argument that the Vision Pro is worth it simply as a very expensive TV</p></div><p>Yet, there’s just nothing like that on the Vision Pro at launch, even though Apple is so focused on fitness and health across its other devices. I think it’s because the Vision Pro just doesn’t seem suited to those kinds of physical game experiences — it’s heavy, with that external battery, and it’s hard to see how some of these games would even work without controllers. Apple tells me that game developers working in Unity are hard at work porting over more games and that visionOS allows developers to come up with custom hand gestures, which might solve for some of the controller issues — I was able to try a prerelease version of <em>Super Fruit Ninja </em>that used a custom slashing gesture in a briefing, and it seemed to work well, but that was about it so far.</p><p>One note about VR motion in the Vision Pro: it doesn’t really do anything to protect you from yourself. I am fairly comfortable in VR — my wife and I use Supernatural, and I went through a brief, delightful period of being absolutely addicted to <em>Gran Turismo 7 VR</em> on the PSVR 2. I am pretty aware of my limits in VR motion, and I can do most things without a problem. But the Vision Pro is so convincing and so unconcerned with whether you might have any limits that you can easily go too far too fast and get yourself a little queasy. I watched five minutes of <em>Avatar: The Way of Water</em> in 3D in Disney Plus — the Vision Pro is the first consumer device to support high frame rate movies in 3D! — and immediately needed to stop because the motion was just too much. I recommend early adopters go slowly and make sure you find your limits gently. That first bout of VR motion sickness is no joke.&nbsp;</p><p><h3>Wrap up</h3></p><p>The Vision Pro is an astounding product.&nbsp;It’s the sort of first-generation device only Apple can really make, from the incredible display and passthrough engineering, to the use of the whole ecosystem to make it so seamlessly useful, to even getting everyone to pretty much ignore the whole external battery situation. There’s a part of me that says the Vision Pro only exists because Apple is so incredibly capable, stocked with talent, and loaded with resources that the company simply went out and engineered the hell out of the hardest problems it could think of in order to find a challenge.</p><p>That’s good! There are a lot of ideas in the Vision Pro, and they’re all executed with the kind of thoughtful intention that few other companies can ever deliver at all, let alone on the first iteration. But the shocking thing is that Apple may have inadvertently revealed that some of these core ideas are actually dead ends — that they can’t ever be executed well enough to become mainstream. This is the best video passthrough headset ever made, and that might mean camera-based mixed reality passthrough could just be a road to nowhere. This is the best hand- and eye-tracking ever, and it feels like the mouse, keyboard, and touchscreen are going to remain undefeated for years to come. There is so much technology in this thing that feels like magic when it works and frustrates you completely when it doesn’t.</p><div><div role="button" aria-label="Zoom" tabindex="0"><figure><div><p><span><img alt="A close up of a woman wearing the Vision Pro" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" sizes="(max-width: 1023px) 100vw, 744px" srcset="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/376x251/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255989/246965_vision_pro_AKrales_0160.jpg 376w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/384x256/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255989/246965_vision_pro_AKrales_0160.jpg 384w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/415x277/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255989/246965_vision_pro_AKrales_0160.jpg 415w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/480x320/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255989/246965_vision_pro_AKrales_0160.jpg 480w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/540x360/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255989/246965_vision_pro_AKrales_0160.jpg 540w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/640x427/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255989/246965_vision_pro_AKrales_0160.jpg 640w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/750x500/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255989/246965_vision_pro_AKrales_0160.jpg 750w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/828x552/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255989/246965_vision_pro_AKrales_0160.jpg 828w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/1080x720/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255989/246965_vision_pro_AKrales_0160.jpg 1080w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/1200x800/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255989/246965_vision_pro_AKrales_0160.jpg 1200w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/1440x960/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255989/246965_vision_pro_AKrales_0160.jpg 1440w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/1920x1280/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255989/246965_vision_pro_AKrales_0160.jpg 1920w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/2048x1365/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255989/246965_vision_pro_AKrales_0160.jpg 2048w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/2400x1600/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255989/246965_vision_pro_AKrales_0160.jpg 2400w" src="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2700x1800/2400x1600/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25255989/246965_vision_pro_AKrales_0160.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></span></p></div></figure></div><p><cite>Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>The other way to look at the Vision Pro is that Apple knows all of this, but the technology to build the true AR glasses it has long hinted at is simply not there — so the Vision Pro represents something like a simulator or a developer kit. A dream factory for people to build apps and meaningful use cases for the imagined hardware yet to come: true optical AR glasses that let you share digital experiences with other people. In that framework, this Vision Pro is the hardware Apple <em>can </em>ship right now to get everyone thinking about these ideas while it pours all those resources into the hardware it <em>wants</em> to build. Maybe! It’s fun to think about that possibility, and a lot of people have already assumed that’s the case.</p><p>But one of the oldest rules we have here at <em>The Verge</em> is that you have to review what’s in the box — the product that’s shipping today, not the promise of improvements yet to come. And so I keep coming back to all the questions I’ve been asking myself ever since I first strapped the Vision Pro onto my head. Starting, of course, with the most important:</p><div><ul><li>Do you want a computer that messes up your hair every time you use it?</li><li>Do you want a computer that smears your makeup every time you use it, if you wear makeup?</li><li>Do you want a computer that allows the Walt Disney Company to prevent you from taking pictures of what you see?</li><li>Do you want to use a computer where you easily can’t show anyone else what you’re looking at?</li><li>Do you think the fanciest TV you own should have HDMI inputs?</li><li>Do you want to use a computer that doesn’t work as well in a dark room?</li><li>Do you want to use a computer that is <em>always looking at your hands</em>?</li></ul></div><p>That is a <em>lot</em> of tradeoffs — big tradeoffs, not little ones. And the biggest tradeoff of all is that using the Vision Pro is such a lonely experience, regardless of the weird ghost eyes on the front. You’re in there, having experiences all by yourself that no one else can take part in. After using the Vision Pro for a while, I’ve come to agree with what Tim Cook has been saying for so long: headsets are inherently isolating. That’s fine for traditional VR headsets, which have basically turned into single-use game consoles over the past decade, but it’s a lot weirder for a primary computing device.</p><p>I don’t want to get work done in the Vision Pro. I get my work done with other people, and I’d rather be <em>out here</em> with them.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p data-block="sciam/paragraph"><span>T</span>ransnational security investigator Abdelkader Abderrahmane set out from the Moroccan city of Kenitra with two research assistants to inspect sand-mining sites on the Atlantic Ocean coast. They drove across the dry, flat terrain for six kilometers, the last stretch on a rutted dirt road that had them crawling in low gear, windows closed against the hot dust. The beach dunes where they were headed lay beyond a rise. As they approached, a man wearing a gendarme cap suddenly appeared to their right, speeding toward them on an all-terrain vehicle. With angry gestures, he forced them to a stop. “Why are you here?!” he demanded. “There's nowhere to go.” One assistant said they just wanted to visit the beach and the nearby tourist camp. The gendarme shook his head: no further.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">They turned around and began to creep back down the rough road, but as soon as the gendarme was out of sight they turned off and snuck along a hidden side of the ridge. About 400 meters further they stopped and cut the engine. Abderrahmane walked quietly to the crest of the bluff to peer down, keeping low to avoid being seen. Despite all his research into illegal sand mines, he was unprepared for the scene below. Half a dozen dump trucks scattered across a deeply pitted moonscape were filled high with brown sand. Just beyond lay the light blue sea. Abderrahmane was stunned by the “major disfiguration” of the dunes, he told me later on a video call. “It was a shock.”</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Part of his shock came from the sight of desecrated nature, but part came from seeing the brazenness of trucks hauling sand in full daylight. “You cannot illegally mine sand in daylight if you don't have people helping you,” he says—people in high places. “Big companies are being protected, perhaps by ministers or deputy ministers or whoever. It's a whole system.” Everyone in the sand-trafficking market “benefits from it, from top to bottom.”</p><hr><h2>On supporting science journalism</h2><p>If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by<!-- --> <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/getsciam/">subscribing</a>.

ISS papers showed how environmental degradation can fuel tensions among people and compromise security. But until a few years ago Abderrahmane had never heard of sand trafficking. He had been in Mali doing fieldwork on the drug trade when a source noted that most cannabis in Mali came from Morocco and that sand trafficking was also a major market in that country, with drug traffickers involved. “I think that when you talk about sand trafficking, most people would not believe it,” Abderrahmane says. “Me included. Now I do.”</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Very few people are looking closely at the illegal sand system or calling for changes, however, because sand is a mundane resource. Yet sand mining is the world's largest extraction industry because sand is a main ingredient in concrete, and the global construction industry has been soaring for decades. Every year the world uses up to 50 billion metric tons of sand, according to a United Nations Environment Program report. The only natural resource more widely consumed is water. A 2022 study by researchers at the University of Amsterdam concluded that we are dredging river sand at rates that far outstrip nature's ability to replace it, so much so that the world could <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969722029746__;!!NLFGqXoFfo8MMQ!t9MRW1HlRlmTOotCnjdkZ_0gRgVjosvHxtvvf5kpsm2Vemzp2RNV3gI6Dyzb6Mdv_ND862UgvL_NBb4I3-6T2ws$">run out of construction-grade sand by 2050</a>. The U.N. report confirms that sand mining at current rates is unsustainable.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">The greatest demand comes from China, which used more cement in three years (6.6 gigatons from 2011 through 2013) than the U.S. used in the entire 20th century (4.5 gigatons), notes Vince Beiser, author of <em>The World in a Grain</em>. Most sand gets used in the country where it is mined, but with some national supplies dwindling, imports reached $1.9 billion in 2018, according to Harvard's Atlas of Economic Complexity.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Companies large and small dredge up sand from waterways and the ocean floor and transport it to wholesalers, construction firms and retailers. Even the legal sand trade is hard to track. Two experts estimate the global market at about $100 billion a year, yet the U.S. Geological Survey Mineral Commodity Summaries indicates the value could be as high as $785 billion. Sand in riverbeds, lake beds and shorelines is the best for construction, but scarcity opens the market to less suitable sand from beaches and dunes, much of it scraped illegally and cheaply. With a shortage looming and prices rising, sand from Moroccan beaches and dunes is sold inside the country and is also shipped abroad, using organized crime's extensive transport networks, Abderrahmane has found. More than half of Morocco's sand is illegally mined, he says.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Luis Fernando Ramadon, a federal police specialist in Brazil who studies extractive industries, estimates that the global illegal sand trade ranges from $200 billion to $350 billion a year—more than illegal logging, gold mining and fishing combined. Buyers rarely check the provenance of sand; legal and black market sand look identical. Illegal mining rarely draws heat from law enforcement because it looks like legitimate mining—trucks, backhoes and shovels—there's no property owner lodging complaints, and officials may be profiting. For crime syndicates, it's easy money.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">The environmental impacts are substantial. Dredging rivers destroys estuaries and habitats and exacerbates flooding. Scraping coastal ecosystems churns up vegetation, soil and seabeds and disrupts marine life. In some countries, illegal mining makes up a large portion of the total activity, and its environmental impacts are often worse than those of legitimate operators, Beiser says, all to build cities on the cheap.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Questionable mining happens worldwide. In the early 1990s in San Diego County, California, officials stopped mining from the San Luis Rey River, only to see operators move across the border into Baja California to plunder riverbeds there. Until a few years ago, a mine north of Monterey, Calif., operated by Cemex, a global construction company, was pulling more than 270,000 cubic meters of sand every year from the beach, operating in a legal gray zone. That was the last beach mine in the U.S., shut down in 2020 by grassroots pressure. Mining in rivers and deltas, however, is still going strong throughout the U.S., not all of it legal.</p><figure data-responsive-image="responsive-image" data-original-class="article-media" data-block="sciam/image"><div><a aria_label="Open image in new tab" href="https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/assets/Image/2023/saw0224Tayl31_d.jpg?w=2000&amp;disable=upscale" target="_blank"><picture><source media="(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)" sizes="(min-width: 900px) 900px, (min-resolution: 3dppx) 50vw, (min-resolution: 2dppx) 75vw, 100vw" srcset="https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/assets/Image/2023/saw0224Tayl31_d.jpg?w=600 600w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/assets/Image/2023/saw0224Tayl31_d.jpg?w=750 750w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/assets/Image/2023/saw0224Tayl31_d.jpg?w=900 900w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/assets/Image/2023/saw0224Tayl31_d.jpg?w=1000 1000w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/assets/Image/2023/saw0224Tayl31_d.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/assets/Image/2023/saw0224Tayl31_d.jpg?w=1350 1350w"><source media="(max-width: 767px)" sizes="(min-resolution: 3dppx) 50vw, (min-resolution: 2dppx) 75vw, 100vw" srcset="https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/assets/Image/2023/saw0224Tayl31_m.jpg?w=600 600w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/assets/Image/2023/saw0224Tayl31_m.jpg?w=750 750w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/assets/Image/2023/saw0224Tayl31_m.jpg?w=1000 1000w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/assets/Image/2023/saw0224Tayl31_m.jpg?w=1200 1200w"><img alt="Line charts show supply, demand and price of sand.

Sverdrup et al., in <em>BioPhysical Economics and Resource Quality</em>, Vol. 2; May 2017 (<em>data</em>)</figcaption></figure><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Sand is any hard, granular material—stones, shells, whatever—between 0.0625 and two millimeters in diameter. Fine-quality sand is used in glass, and still-finer grades appear in solar panels and silicon chips for electronics. Desert sand typically consists of grains rounded like tiny marbles from constant weathering. The best sand for construction, however, has angular grains, which helps concrete mixtures bind. River sand is preferable to coastal sand, partly because coastal sand has to be washed free of salt. But coastal sand does get used, especially when builders take shortcuts, leading to buildings that have shorter life spans and pose greater risks for inhabitants. Such shortcuts worsened the damage from the disastrous February 2023 earthquake that shook Turkey and Syria, says Mette Bendixen, a physical geographer at McGill University who has investigated the effects of sand mining since 2017.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">I was first alerted to sand mafias by Louise Shelley, who leads the Terrorism, Transnational Crime and Corruption Center at George Mason University. Shelley realized sand mining could be a natural evolution of organized crime when, five years ago, she was a guest at a NATO lunch conference held near the Pentagon. A top NATO official approached her to talk about illegal fishing off West Africa, saying it posed a serious threat to European and NATO security. They talked about how the low threshold for entry into an environmental crime such as wildlife poaching can draw criminal rings and then lead them into other types of organized environmental crime, such as illegal logging. Sand mining was another case in point. Shelley says in northwestern Africa there is a confluence of trafficking factors: the region offers entry to European markets, and its mosaic of fragile governments, terrorist groups and corrupt international corporations makes it vulnerable.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">In addition to social instability, Shelley is concerned about sand mining's “devastating environmental impacts.” Stripping away sand removes nature's physical system for holding water, with huge effects for people's way of life. River sand acts like a sponge, helping to replenish the entire watershed after dry spells; if too much sand is removed, natural replenishment can no longer sustain the river, which aggravates water supply for people and leads to loss of vegetation and wildlife. Harvesting has removed so much sand from Asia's Mekong Delta that the river system is drying up.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Removing sand from coasts makes land that already faces sea-level rise even more exposed. Abderrahmane saw this in Morocco when he drove north from Rabat to Larache, known as “the balcony of the Atlantic.” The town, which looks out over 50-meter-high cliffs toward the sea, is a hub of Morocco's thriving fishing industry. A 2001 government document known as the Plan Azur proposed greater protection of nature in many places in the country scoured for sand, including Larache. But in his 2021 field research, Abderrahmane found that the dark sand and rock-strewn beach there was rife with mining. Teams of workers loaded up donkeys with saddle packs full of sand, leaving stony craters at the water's edge. They goaded the donkeys up footpaths torn into the soft, steep bluffs to trucks waiting above to haul the illicit material to various concrete production sites.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">In Mozambique, increasingly destructive flash flooding has hit the town of Nagonha, which lies on the Indian Ocean. Elders there told Amnesty International they can't recall any comparable flooding in the past, before the Hainan Haiyu Mining Company started operations in 2011, harvesting sand and minerals such as ilmenite, titanium and zircon from the dunes. The company dumped leftover sand across a wide area, spreading it to make a level working surface, which buried existing vegetation and blocked drainage, according to an Amnesty International report.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">The company's procedures failed to comply with Mozambican law, changed the flow of fresh water and are blamed for making Nagonha more vulnerable to the flash floods that have partly destroyed it, Amnesty International reported. One flood washed 48 homes into the sea, slicing a channel through the dunes, leaving nearly 300 people homeless. One man described to Amnesty International how his family's two-bedroom house vanished: “We felt the house collapsing, and we ran for our lives” as he saw their home “being dragged by the water.”</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph"><span>S</span>and looting is changing the hydrology of entire rivers. Halinishi Yusuf experienced this as a girl growing up in Kenya. She also witnessed mining's violent excess and eventually helped to bring it under control.</p><figure data-responsive-image="responsive-image" data-original-class="article-media" data-block="sciam/image"><div><a aria_label="Open image in new tab" href="https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/assets/Image/2023/saw0224Tayl32_d.jpg?w=2000&amp;disable=upscale" target="_blank"><picture><source media="(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)" sizes="(min-width: 900px) 900px, (min-resolution: 3dppx) 50vw, (min-resolution: 2dppx) 75vw, 100vw" srcset="https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/assets/Image/2023/saw0224Tayl32_d.jpg?w=600 600w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/assets/Image/2023/saw0224Tayl32_d.jpg?w=750 750w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/assets/Image/2023/saw0224Tayl32_d.jpg?w=900 900w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/assets/Image/2023/saw0224Tayl32_d.jpg?w=1000 1000w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/assets/Image/2023/saw0224Tayl32_d.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/assets/Image/2023/saw0224Tayl32_d.jpg?w=1350 1350w"><source media="(max-width: 767px)" sizes="(min-resolution: 3dppx) 50vw, (min-resolution: 2dppx) 75vw, 100vw" srcset="https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/assets/Image/2023/saw0224Tayl32_m.jpg?w=600 600w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/assets/Image/2023/saw0224Tayl32_m.jpg?w=750 750w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/assets/Image/2023/saw0224Tayl32_m.jpg?w=1000 1000w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/assets/Image/2023/saw0224Tayl32_m.jpg?w=1200 1200w"><img alt="Chart shows estimated annual value of transnational crimes.

As a girl, she carried water from the river, and like most residents, her family relied on rain-fed farming to eke out a living. But seasonal rains became erratic as a result of several interconnected climate patterns, and local farming and jobs declined. As life got harder, residents turned to harvesting sand for the construction boom in Nairobi. It was an easy form of employment because no investment was required except a shovel. Yusuf went away for high school in the early 2000s, and when she visited home, she saw trucks parked in the riverbed, loading up. Residents worked as loaders, and vendors sold food to the crews. Any river or tributary was fair game: if it gathered sand, it was exploited, and it wasn't illegal.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Yusuf didn't connect the mining to environmental damage. “It was just sand, anyway,” she says about her outlook back then. And the trade pumped cash into the economy; the village “was vibrant,” Yusuf told me on a video call. But damage to river systems was becoming clear. Groundwater levels were sinking; riverbeds stripped of sand didn't hold water and failed to refresh aquifers underground. Farmers already struggling couldn't irrigate their crops. Social tensions grew heated. Under Kenya's “devolution” of public services from the national government to the country's 47 counties, local agencies took responsibility for sand-harvesting licenses, often without resources to manage it. The process was unregulated and soon overwhelmed.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">To try to stop the chaos, Makueni County passed a law in 2015 creating a local sand authority. But from 2015 to 2017 violence over sand wracked the area, leaving at least nine people dead and dozens injured. Even legal actors operated clandestinely, and local governments exploited permit fees, Yusuf says. “No one was frowning on this activity.”</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Other counties had similar conflicts, but in Makueni a small group of sand loaders changed course and became vigilantes. They realized that mining was worsening arid conditions and that only outsiders were profiting. They saw officials getting rich from bribes and construction teams hauling the county's sand wealth elsewhere. The group vowed to stop trucks no matter what it took. It imposed its ban on trucks leaving the area by torching offenders. Late one December night in 2016 two Kenyan truck drivers met a horrible death when they were parked beside the Muooni River, loading sand right out of the riverbed after midnight. The vigilantes surrounded them and set the trucks on fire. Both drivers died, burned “beyond recognition,” police reported to local media.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Not all the local people wanted to stop the lucrative business, however, and two factions clashed, resulting in more deaths. The Nairobi transport network poured cash into the pro-mining faction. “The conflict was funded from outside by the sand cartel in Nairobi,” Yusuf says, and law enforcement failed to intervene.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">The violence and damage to the rivers peaked in mid-2017, around when Yusuf left Nairobi, where she had been working on fisheries management. She returned home to lead the Makueni County Sand Authority, which had made little headway. When applying for the job, Yusuf made her soft skills a selling point. She said she would enforce the 2015 law but noted that “there's a palatable way of making the community start appreciating why we need to do this.”</p><figure data-original-class="image-captioned" data-block="sciam/image"><a aria_label="Open image in new tab" href="https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/693EC92F-A909-4E42-A37CACDAC78AC7C8_medium.jpg?w=1536" target="_blank"><img alt="Illustration of two men with guns, with black boxes over their eyes." decoding="async" height="1946" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 900px) 900px, (min-resolution: 3dppx) 50vw, (min-resolution: 2dppx) 75vw, 100vw" src="https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/693EC92F-A909-4E42-A37CACDAC78AC7C8_medium.jpg?w=900" srcset="https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/693EC92F-A909-4E42-A37CACDAC78AC7C8_medium.jpg?w=600 600w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/693EC92F-A909-4E42-A37CACDAC78AC7C8_medium.jpg?w=750 750w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/693EC92F-A909-4E42-A37CACDAC78AC7C8_medium.jpg?w=900 900w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/693EC92F-A909-4E42-A37CACDAC78AC7C8_medium.jpg?w=1000 1000w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/693EC92F-A909-4E42-A37CACDAC78AC7C8_medium.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/693EC92F-A909-4E42-A37CACDAC78AC7C8_medium.jpg?w=1350 1350w" width="1536"></a>
<figcaption>Credit: Mark Smith</figcaption></figure><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">When she began the job, she called a morning meeting in Muooni with local stakeholders. The village administrator and elders spread the word. Several dozen people toting plastic chairs gathered at the Muooni River, where mining was rampant, and sat in the shade. Yusuf had rehearsed her spoken Kikamba, the local language. Although she had taken part in stakeholder meetings in her fisheries job, she had never led one like this. “The entire county is watching,” she thought at the time. “I have to bring it forward.”</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Yusuf explained to her audience how sand supports water in dry areas and how water gets replenished. She said the sand was like a sponge that made water available for them and the ecosystem. “Where there is sand, there is water,” she told them. During the discussion residents became reassured that they could gain income from sand while also allowing it to recharge the water supply. Over the next five years, under Yusuf's leadership, the sand authority gained trust. It prosecuted the worst offenders and imposed strict fines on illicit mining.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Yusuf's strategy was threefold. First, she used government power to stop sand from leaving the county. The authority allowed permits only for local construction projects: no more trucks from Nairobi. Second, Yusuf continued a series of meetings with local groups at the rivers. Finally, she made her office's books public and used that transparency to show that half the revenue from licensing fees went straight to river restoration projects. People aiming to flout the controls backed off. Shady syndicates from Nairobi no longer had effective local agents in Makueni and found it easier to source their sand elsewhere.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">For the first time, sand revenues produced visible local benefits. Projects ranged from “sand dams”—concrete weirs across the riverbed that catch sand pushed downstream by the rains—to “water sumps,” concrete tanks sunk several meters below the riverbed, used to draw drinking water. Leaving riverbeds untouched for even one rainy season (Kenya has two rainy seasons a year) allowed upstream sediment to replenish the controlled withdrawals, according to Yusuf. The community saw that there could be a way of life beyond selling sand to outsiders.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph"><span>C</span>hange is harder in places where local groups lack the power to manage resources. In Morocco, Abderrahmane found a wide range of people profiting from the clandestine system, from local workers to high officials. The few people who protested were intimidated. French documentarian Sophie Bontemps experienced this in 2021 when her crew was filming at dunes near El Jadida. Police arrested them for filming, Bontemps told me, interrogated them for a full day, and confiscated their equipment. That evening a military colonel working with two plainclothes officials arranged a mock trial in a hotel; near midnight they forced the crew members to sign a document in Arabic admitting they had no right to film and to erase their footage. Finally, they were released. (The team had saved the footage elsewhere.) To Bontemps, it was clear that national officials were involved in sand trafficking. Her film, <em>Morocco: Raiding on the Sand</em>, reports incidents of local protesters being threatened and beaten.</p><figure data-original-class="image-captioned" data-block="sciam/image"><a aria_label="Open image in new tab" href="https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/7C108A26-842E-4A20-BAECC4AFD71B5A4F_medium.jpg?w=1536" target="_blank"><img alt="Illustration of a truck filled with sand." decoding="async" height="1990" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 900px) 900px, (min-resolution: 3dppx) 50vw, (min-resolution: 2dppx) 75vw, 100vw" src="https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/7C108A26-842E-4A20-BAECC4AFD71B5A4F_medium.jpg?w=900" srcset="https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/7C108A26-842E-4A20-BAECC4AFD71B5A4F_medium.jpg?w=600 600w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/7C108A26-842E-4A20-BAECC4AFD71B5A4F_medium.jpg?w=750 750w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/7C108A26-842E-4A20-BAECC4AFD71B5A4F_medium.jpg?w=900 900w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/7C108A26-842E-4A20-BAECC4AFD71B5A4F_medium.jpg?w=1000 1000w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/7C108A26-842E-4A20-BAECC4AFD71B5A4F_medium.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/7C108A26-842E-4A20-BAECC4AFD71B5A4F_medium.jpg?w=1350 1350w" width="1536"></a>

Sand mined for nearby buildings might fly below the radar of local officials. But long-haul transport involving scores of trucks traveling long distances on a public highway could not escape notice. In Larache, he couldn't count on government support, so he took a gamble. His team posed as real-estate developers seeking contractors for a big project in Casablanca, more than 200 kilometers south. At a compound where massive reddish sand piles signaled construction supply, one of Abderrahmane's assistants entered through a corrugated metal gate late in the day, when trucks were back from deliveries. He made bidding inquiries for a fictitious building project. He was stunned by the response: bidders could mobilize hundreds of trucks and front-end loaders within a week. “That would be very easy,” one man told him.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">On other days the assistant directly approached drivers of sand-laden trucks parked downtown. From the driver's seat, one transporter explained that contractors could arrange night hauling with up to 250 trucks through a syndicate of firms. Once the sand got delivered, construction companies mixed trafficked sand with legal sources. The contractor's confidence that they could deliver such volumes across great distances, requiring large loads to pass at least 10 highway checkpoints, indicated multiple layers of official collusion, Abderrahmane says.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Because local people often struggle to push back against big syndicates, international pressure can push governments to prosecute traffickers. In Morocco, a strategy would likely require stronger environmental regulations, promotion of sustainable practices and transnational enforcement. An international certification system akin to the Forest Stewardship Council's process for timber sourcing is still only in the discussion phase, says Pascal Peduzzi of the U.N. Environment Program. But Abderrahmane's Moroccan sources say the government might consider action if sites were certified by the Convention on Wetlands, an international process dating back to the 1970s and observed by most U.N. member countries. A country submits a list of wetlands for accreditation, and if the international body overseeing the convention grants it, the wetlands can be monitored by an independent advisory committee to help ensure the site is preserved and not plundered. New technology might help distinguish whether sand came from a legal or illegal operation; in 2023 researchers from several universities demonstrated an optical system that can fingerprint sand grains, allowing them to be traced back to their site of origin.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Before conservationist Rachel Carson created a narrative in the 20th century for water and air pollution in <em>Silent Spring</em>, the general public had little context for seeing streams or the sky as health threats. Journalist Beiser told me he thinks a similar situation exists for sand.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">George Mason's Shelley is encouraged by a new generation's energy for the problem. When we spoke, she was reading student papers about illicit environmental trade, happy that many of the students are career professionals in agencies where they can make a difference. Often it takes fresh eyes to change things, and Yusuf and Abderrahmane may inspire other people who are concerned about the environment and abuse of local communities.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">More research will help build cases against crime rings. The number of sand studies presented at the American Geophysical Union's annual conference grew from two in 2018 to more than 20 in 2023, McGill's Bendixen says. That research can eventually yield better mapping of sand flows, showing hotspots and illegal activity.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Bendixen was heartened that the African Futures Conference in 2023 devoted a special session to sand extraction. “The time is running out for sand,” she says. “More people from as many different angles as possible are shouting out to the world, ‘We have an issue!' I think it's one of the most understudied global challenges of the 21st century.”</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>
<span><span>&lt;2019-04-11 Thu&gt;</span></span>
</p>

<p>
The proposed original hack evolved into the <a href="https://gitlab.com/koral/gcmh">GCMH</a>.
</p>

<p>
Respect to the original hack GCMH has a slightly refined strategy.
</p>

<p>
During pauses garbage collection is reenabled using the default
conventional strategy.
</p>

<p>
This makes sure that in case some elisp is consing (maybe triggered
by a timer) when you restart using your Emacs will be as much
garbage collected as possible.
</p>

<p>
GCMH is now also available on MELPA
<a href="https://melpa.org/#/gcmh">https://melpa.org/#/gcmh</a>
</p>

<p>
PS: Some discussion on <a href="https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2019-04/msg01036.html">emacs-devel</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/bg85qm/garbage_collector_magic_hack/">reddit</a> about GCMH.

<p>
PPS: Do not forget to try out customizing `gcmh-verbose' to t to get an idea
about how much time I did saved you! ;)

<p>
Living into the GNU Emacs Lisp Machine is as attractive as convenient.
</p>

<p>
One of the many advantages is being able to forget about the barbarian
practice of the manual memory management.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately everything comes with a price and Emacs as to recollect
all unused memory from time to time, here we come to (in)famous
garbage collector.
</p>

<p>
This post is not about the details of the Emacs GC but rather on how
to tweak it to suit our needs.
</p>

<p>
If you have an Emacs running since a while just check the <code>gc-elapsed</code>
variable. This is the time spent in GC for the current session in
second. You'll get an idea of how much is unacceptable this
problem…
</p>

<p>
We'll certainly have to be sneaky to fix it.
</p>

<p>
The first thing you want to do is probably to see when GC is
running.
</p>

<div>
<pre>(setq garbage-collection-messages t)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Using Emacs for a while with this setup you'll notice that when
Elisp is running and consing GC is coming into play really often.
</p>

<p>
This is infact the reason why we do not notice it, it's just running
all the time…
</p>

<p>
In the moment that garbage collection becomes visible to you the
next immediate and obvious consequence step is that you are
starving to optimize it.
</p>

<p>
The first information you'll find about how to trim the Emacs GC is
the <code>gc-cons-threshold</code> variable. This represents (as the manual
says) the <code>"Number of bytes of consing between garbage collections."</code>
</p>

<p>
The default value (800KB) is quite small but this should not come as a
surprise seen the fact that Emacs was made to run on really
constrained hardware systems.
</p>

<p>
The first optimization attempt would be to increase this
threshold. This is done by many (say mosts) but unfortunately does
not solve the problem but just make it worst.
</p>

<p>
An higher threshold certainly reduce the number of GC runs but these
are just longer translating in more annoying hangs of the whole
universe.
</p>

<p>
Infact what you want to do is to have the GC happening when you are
not using Emacs actively; Say when you are thinking while reading,
annoying a colleague or having a coffee.
</p>

<p>
The GC is not smart enough to understand when you are going to use
the keyboard to input a command in the nearhood future, nobody can
predict the future infact (not even Emacs) but here the interval
distribution comes into play to help us. The long story short is
that is possible to extrapolate from interval distribution that if
something did not happened for a while is unlikely to happen
soon. Surprise!!
</p>

<p>
With this truth revealed this is the trick I propose:
</p>

<div>
<pre>(<span>defmacro</span> <span>k-time</span> (<span>&amp;rest</span> body)
  <span>"Measure and return the time it takes evaluating BODY."</span>
  `(<span>let</span> ((time (current-time)))
     ,@body
     (float-time (time-since time))))

<p>
As first I'm consciously setting the GC threshold to 1GB. Probably
many will be surprised but this is just a polite way to say: "NEVER
garbage collect unless we are potentially causing the OS to swap
pages."
</p>

<p>
The second action I'm taking is to set a timer using
<code>run-with-idle-timer</code>. That means that every time Emacs will be idle
for 15 secs we'll garbage collect once. The assumption is that the
probability that we are going to input a command exactly after 15
secs is rather low.
</p>

<p>
I believe this unconventional garbage collection strategy should be
completely clear to the reader now.
</p>

<p>
You can tweak the two parameters as you prefer and experiment a bit
with maybe less extreme values. If <code>gc-cons-threshold</code> is enough
high to avoid GC during start-up also this will benefit from this
setup. This exact value really depends on your Emacs
configuration. In general Emacs will feel more responsive.
</p>

<p>
To conclude I believe the biggest advantage is probably that coming
back from the coffee or just from time to time you'll see into the
mini-buffer how much time you have saved. This will certainly boost
your productivity and enthusiasm. In case this happens you'll
forever be grateful to me.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Thanks to some coworkers and David Wilson’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74zOY-vgkyw&amp;list=PLEoMzSkcN8oPH1au7H6B7bBJ4ZO7BXjSZ">Emacs from Scratch
playlist</a>,
I’ve been getting back into Emacs. The community is more vibrant than
the last time I looked, and
<a href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/">LSP</a> brings
modern completion and inline type checking.</p>

<p>David’s Emacs looks so fancy — I want nice colors and fonts
too, especially my preferred themes like
<a href="https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/">Solarized</a>.</p>

<p>From desktop environments, Emacs automatically supports 24-bit color.</p>

</figure>

<p>But, since I work on infrastructure, I’ve lived primarily in terminals
for years. And my Emacs looks like:</p>

<a href="https://chadaustin.me/images/truecolor-terminal-emacs/emacs-terminal.png"><img src="https://chadaustin.me/images/truecolor-terminal-emacs/emacs-terminal.png" alt="Terminal Emacs: Not Fancy"></a>
<figcaption>Terminal Emacs: Not Fancy</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>It turns out, for <em>years</em>, <a href="https://github.com/termstandard/colors#truecolor-support-in-output-devices">popular terminals have supported 24-bit
color</a>.
And yet they’re rarely used.</p>

<p>Like everything else, it boil down to legacy and politics. Control
codes are a protocol, and changes to that protocol take time to
propagate, especially with missteps along the way.</p>

<p>This post is two things:</p>
<ol>
  <li>how to enable true-color support in the terminal environments I
use, and</li>
  <li>how my desire for nice colors in Emacs led to poring over technical
standards from the 70s, 80s, and 90s, wondering how we got to this
point.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>NOTE:</em></strong> I did my best, but please forgive any terminology
slip-ups or false histories. I grew up on VGA text mode UIs, but
never used a hardware terminal and wasn’t introduced to unix until
much later.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="ansi-escape-codes">ANSI Escape Codes</h2>

<p>Early hardware terminals offered their own, incompatible, control code
schemes. That made writing portable software hard, so ANSI
standardized the protocol, while reserving room for expansion and
vendor-specific capabilities.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code">ANSI escape codes</a>
date back to the 70s. They cover a huge range of functionality, but
since this post is focused on colors, I’m mostly interested in SGR
(Select Graphics Rendition), which allows configuring a variety of
character display attributes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>bold or intensity</li>
  <li>italics (not frequently supported)</li>
  <li>blink</li>
  <li>foreground and background colors</li>
  <li>and a bunch of other stuff. You can look at Wikipedia.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="3--4--and-8-bit-color">3-, 4-, and 8-bit Color</h2>

<p>When color was introduced, there were eight. Black, white, the
additive primaries, and the subtractive primaries. The eight corners
of an RGB color cube.</p>

<p>Later, a bright (or bold) bit added eight more; “bright black” being
dark gray.</p>

<p>In 1999, <a href="https://invisible-island.net/xterm/xterm.log.html#xterm_111">Todd Larason patched xterm to add support for 256
colors</a>.
He chose a palette that filled out the RGB color cube with a 6x6x6
interior sampling and added a 24-entry finer-precision grayscale ramp.</p>

</figure>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>NOTE:</em></strong> There’s a rare, but still-supported, 88-color variant
with a 4x4x4 color cube and 8-entry grayscale ramp, primarily to
reduce the use of historically-limited X11 color objects.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>NOTE:</em></strong> We’ll debug this later, but Todd’s patch to add
256-color support to xterm used semicolons as the separator between
the ANSI SGR command 48 and the color index, which set off a chain
reaction of ambiguity we’re still dealing with today.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="where-did-24-bit-color-support-come-from">Where Did 24-Bit Color Support Come From?</h2>

<p>It’s well-documented how to send 8-bit and 24-bit colors to compatible
terminals. Per
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#8-bit">Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<p><code>ESC[38;5;&lt;n&gt;m</code> sets foreground color <code>n</code> per the palettes above.</p>

<p><code>ESC[38;2;&lt;r&gt;;&lt;g&gt;;&lt;b&gt;m</code> sets foreground color (<code>r</code>, <code>g</code>, <code>b</code>).</p>

<p>(Again, that confusion about <a href="https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/escape-sequences.html#graphic-rendition-sgr">semicolons vs.
colons</a>,
and an unused colorspace ID if colons are used. We’ll get to the
bottom of that soon.)</p>

<p>But why 5? Why 2? How did any of this come about? I’d struggled enough
with unexpected output that it was time to discover the ground truth.</p>

<p>Finding and reading original sources led me to construct the following
narrative:</p>

<ul>
  <li>In the 70s, ANSI standardized terminal escape sequences, resulting
in <a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/FIPS/fipspub86.pdf">ANSI
X3.64</a>
and the better-known
<a href="https://www.ecma-international.org/wp-content/uploads/ECMA-48_5th_edition_june_1991.pdf">ECMA-48</a>.</li>
  <li>The first edition of ECMA-48 is lost to time, but it probably looks
much like ANSI X3.64.</li>
  <li>The <a href="https://ecma-international.org/wp-content/uploads/ECMA-48_2nd_edition_august_1979.pdf">2nd
edition</a>
of ECMA-48 (1979) allocated SGR parameters 30-37 and 40-47 for setting
3-bit foreground and background colors, respectively.
    <ul>
      <li>By the way, these standards use the word “parameter” to mean
command, and “subparameter” to mean argument, if applicable.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The <a href="https://ecma-international.org/wp-content/uploads/ECMA-48_3rd_edition_march_1984.pdf">3rd
edition</a>
(1984) introduced the concept of an implementation-defined default
color for both foreground and background, and allocated parameters
39 and 49, respectively.</li>
  <li>Somewhere in this timeline, vendors did ship hardware terminals with
richer color support. The <a href="https://terminals-wiki.org/wiki/index.php/Wyse_WY-370">Wyse
WY-370</a>
introduced new color modes, including a direct-indexed 64-color
palette. (See Page 86 of its <a href="http://bitsavers.org/pdf/wyse/WY-370/881133-02A_WY-370_Programmers_Guide_Jun90.pdf">Programmer’s
Guide</a>.)</li>
  <li>38 and 48 are the most important parameters for selecting colors
today, but they weren’t allocated by either the
<a href="https://ecma-international.org/wp-content/uploads/ECMA-48_4th_edition_december_1986.pdf">4th</a>
(1986) or
<a href="https://www.ecma-international.org/wp-content/uploads/ECMA-48_5th_edition_june_1991.pdf">5th</a>
(1991) editions. So where did they come from? The 5th edition gives
a clue:
    <blockquote>
      <p>reserved for future standardization; intended for setting
character foreground colour as specified in ISO 8613-6 [CCITT
Recommendation T.416]</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ISO 8613 was a boondoggle of a project intended to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Document_Architecture">standardize and
replace all proprietary document file
formats</a>.
You’ve never heard of it, so it obviously failed. But its legacy
lives on – ISO 8613-6 (ITU T.416) (1993) built on ECMA-48’s codes
and defined parameters 38 and 48 as extended foreground and
background color modes, respectively.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>The first parameter element indicates a choice between:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>0 implementation defined (only applicable for the character foreground colour)</li>
        <li>1 transparent;</li>
        <li>2 direct colour in RGB space;</li>
        <li>3 direct colour in CMY space;</li>
        <li>4 direct colour in CMYK space;</li>
        <li>5 indexed colour.</li>
      </ul>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>There we go! <em>That</em> is why 5 is used for 256-color mode and 2 is
24-bit RGB.</p>

<p>Careful reading also gives a clue as to the semicolon vs. colon syntax
screw-up. Note the subtle use of the term “parameter element” vs.
“parameter”.</p>

<p>If you read ISO 8613-6 (ITU T.416) and ECMA-48 closely, it’s not
explicitly stated, but they seem to indicate that unknown parameters
for commands like “select graphics rendition” should be ignored. And
parameters are separated with semicolons.</p>

<p>That implies <code>ESC[38;5;3m</code> should be interpreted, in terminals that
don’t support SGR 38, as “unknown, ignored (38)”, “blinking (5)”, and
“italicized (3)”. The syntax should use colons to separate
sub-parameter components, but something got lost along the way.</p>

<p>(Now, in practice, programs are told how to communicate with their
terminals via the TERM variable and the terminfo database, so I
don’t know how much pain occurs in reality.)</p>

<p>Thomas Dickey has done a great job documenting the history of
<a href="https://invisible-island.net/ncurses/">ncurses</a> and
<a href="https://invisible-island.net/xterm/xterm.log.html">xterm</a>, and, lo
and behold, explains exactly the <a href="https://invisible-island.net/xterm/xterm.faq.html#semicolon_vs_colon">origin of the ambiguous
syntax</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We used semicolon (like other SGR parameters) for separating the
R/G/B values in the escape sequence, since a copy of ITU T.416
(ISO-8613-6) which presumably clarified the use of colon for this
feature was costly.</p>

  <p>Using semicolon was incorrect because some applications could expect
their parameters to be order-independent. As used for the R/G/B
values, that was order-dependent. The relevant information, by the
way, is part of ECMA-48 (not ITU T.416, as mentioned in Why only 16
(or 256) colors?). Quoting from section 5.4.2 of ECMA-48, page 12,
and adding emphasis (not in the standard):</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Each parameter sub-string consists of one or more bit combinations
from 03/00 to 03/10; the bit combinations from 03/00 to 03/09
represent the digits ZERO to NINE; bit combination 03/10 may be
used as a separator in a parameter sub-string, for example, to
separate the fractional part of a decimal number from the integer
part of that number.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>and later on page 78, in 8.3.117 SGR – SELECT GRAPHIC RENDITION, the
description of SGR 38:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>(reserved for future standardization; intended for setting
character foreground colour as specified in ISO 8613-6 [CCITT
Recommendation T.416])</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Of course you will immediately recognize that 03/10 is ASCII colon,
and that ISO 8613-6 necessarily refers to the encoding in a
parameter sub-string. Or perhaps you will not.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So it’s all because the ANSI and ISO standards are ridiculously
expensive (to this day, these crappy PDF scans from the 90s and
earlier are $200 USD!) and because they use a baroque syntax to denote
ASCII characters. While writing this post, I had to keep <code>man ascii</code>
open to match, for example, <code>03/10</code> to colon and <code>03/11</code> to semicolon.
I guess it’s how standards were written back then. A Hacker News
thread in the context of WezTerm <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35138390">gives more
detail</a>.</p>

<p>So, to recap in the timeline:</p>

<ul>
  <li>1999: <a href="https://invisible-island.net/xterm/xterm.log.html#xterm_111">Thomas Dickey merged Todd Larason’s 256-color
patches</a>
with ambiguous semicolon syntax.</li>
  <li>2006: Konsole added support for 256-color and 24-bit truecolor using
the same ambiguous syntax as xterm, with a <a href="https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=107487">follow-on
discussion</a> about
colons vs. semicolons. The issue was noticed, but semicolon syntax
was adopted anyway.</li>
  <li>2012: Thomas Dickey <a href="https://invisible-island.net/xterm/xterm.log.html#xterm_282">fixed xterm to accept the standards-compliant
syntax</a>.</li>
  <li>2016: Windows 10’s built-in console gained <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/24-bit-color-in-the-windows-console/">ANSI escape code
support, including 24-bit
colors</a>.
Unfortunately with the ambiguous semicolon syntax.</li>
  <li>2019: Windows Terminal is released, with ANSI escape code support,
but also using ambiguous semicolon syntax.</li>
  <li>2022: Microsoft announced <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/console/ecosystem-roadmap">ecosystem-wide
migration</a>
from the legacy framebuffer-based VGA-style console subsystem to
ANSI terminal emulation, specifically using xterm as a guide.</li>
  <li>2022: Konsole <a href="https://github.com/KDE/konsole/commit/316a386d92a083e235624e9f81df3b6dbbe08bff">gains support for standards-compliant
syntax</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Okay, here’s what we’ve established:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ANSI codes are widely supported, even on Windows.</li>
  <li>Truecolor support is either widely supported or (for example, on the
Linux text mode terminal) at least recognized and mapped to a more
limited palette.</li>
  <li>Semicolon syntax is the most compatible, though the unambiguous
colon syntax is slowly spreading.</li>
</ul>

<p>I wrote a <a href="https://gist.github.com/chadaustin/2d2c2cb4b71fd1d4163aa8115077624a">small colortest.rs program to test color support and attributes like
reverse and
italics</a>
to confirm the above in every terminal I use.</p>

<h2 id="terminfo">Terminfo</h2>

<p>Now that we’ve established terminal capabilities and how to use them,
the next trick is to convince software of varying lineages to detect
and use the best color support available.</p>

<p>Typically, this is done with the old
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminfo">terminfo</a> library (or the
even older <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Termcap">termcap</a>).</p>

<p>Terminfo provides a database of terminal capabilities and the ability
to generate appropriate escape sequences. The TERM environment
variable tells programs which terminfo record to use. Its value is
automatically forwarded over <code>ssh</code> connections.</p>

<p>Terminfo uses ridiculous command names: <code>infocmp</code>, <code>tic</code>, <code>toe</code>. (Not
to be confused with the unrelated <code>tac</code>.)</p>

<p>To see the list of terminfo records installed on your host, run <code>toe
-a</code>. (Do we /really/ need to install support for every legacy hardware
terminal on modern machines? Good luck even finding a hardware
terminal these days. They’re collector’s items.)</p>

<p><code>infocmp</code> is how you inspect the capabilities of a specific terminfo
record.</p>

<p>There’s so much junk in there. I wonder how much only applies to
non-ANSI hardware terminals, and therefore is irrelevant these days.</p>

<p>For now, we’re only interested in three of these capabilities:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>colors</code> is how many colors this terminal supports. The standard
values are 0, 8, 16, 256, and 0x1000000 (24-bit), though other
values exist.</li>
  <li><code>setaf</code> and <code>setab</code> set foreground and background colors,
respectively. I believe they stand for “Set ANSI Foreground” and
“Set ANSI Background”. Each takes a single argument, the color
number.</li>
</ul>

<p>Those percent signs are a parameter arithmetic and substitution
language. Let’s decode <code>setaf</code> in particular:</p>

<div><pre><code>setaf=\E[%?%p1%{8}%&lt;%t3%p1%d%e%p1%{16}%&lt;%t9%p1%{8}%-%d%e38;5;%p1%d%;m
</code></pre></div>

<div><pre><code>print "\E["
if p1 &lt; 8 {
  print "3" p1
} else if p1 &lt; 16 {
  print "9" (p1 - 8)
} else {
  print "38;5;" p1
}
print "m"
</code></pre></div>

<p>This is the <code>xterm-256color</code> terminfo description. It only knows how
to output the ANSI 30-37 SGR parameters, the non-standard 90-97
brights (from IBM AIX), or otherwise the 256-entry palette, using
ambiguous semicolon-delimited syntax.</p>

<p>Let’s compare with <code>xterm-direct</code>, the terminfo entry that supports
RGB.</p>

<div><pre><code>$ infocmp xterm-256color xterm-direct
comparing xterm-256color to xterm-direct.
    comparing booleans.
        ccc: T:F.
    comparing numbers.
        colors: 256, 16777216.
    comparing strings.
        initc: '\E]4;%p1%d;rgb:%p2%{255}%*%{1000}%/%2.2X/%p3%{255}%*%{1000}%/%2.2X/%p4%{255}%*%{1000}%/%2.2X\E\\', NULL.
        oc: '\E]104\007', NULL.
        rs1: '\Ec\E]104\007', '\Ec'.
        setab: '\E[%?%p1%{8}%&lt;%t4%p1%d%e%p1%{16}%&lt;%t10%p1%{8}%-%d%e48;5;%p1%d%;m', '\E[%?%p1%{8}%&lt;%t4%p1%d%e48:2::%p1%{65536}%/%d:%p1%{256}%/%{255}%&amp;%d:%p1%{255}%&amp;%d%;m'.
        setaf: '\E[%?%p1%{8}%&lt;%t3%p1%d%e%p1%{16}%&lt;%t9%p1%{8}%-%d%e38;5;%p1%d%;m', '\E[%?%p1%{8}%&lt;%t3%p1%d%e38:2::%p1%{65536}%/%d:%p1%{256}%/%{255}%&amp;%d:%p1%{255}%&amp;%d%;m'.
</code></pre></div>

<p>A few things are notable:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>xterm-direct</code> advertises 16.7 million colors, as expected.</li>
  <li><code>xterm-direct</code> unsets the <code>ccc</code> boolean, which indicates color
indices cannot have new RGB values assigned.</li>
  <li>Correspondingly, xterm-direct unsets <code>initc</code>, <code>oc</code>, and <code>rs1</code>, also
related to changing color values at runtime.</li>
  <li>And of course <code>setaf</code> and <code>setab</code> change. We’ll decode that next.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here’s where Terminfo’s limitations cause us trouble. Terminfo and
ncurses are tied at the hip. Their programming model is that there are
N palette entries, each of which has a default RGB value, and
terminals may support overriding any palette entry’s RGB value.</p>

<p>The <code>-direct</code> terminals, however, are different. They represent 24-bit
colors by pretending there are 16.7 million palette entries, each of
which maps to the 8:8:8 RGB cube, but whose values cannot be changed.</p>

<p>Now let’s look at the new <code>setaf</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code>print "\E["
if p1 &lt; 8 {
  print "3" p1
} else {
  print "38:2::" (p1 / 65536) ":" ((p1 / 256) &amp; 255) ":" (p1 &amp; 255)
}
print "m"
</code></pre></div>

<p>It’s not <em>quite</em> as simple as direct RGB. For compatibility with
programs that assume the meaning of <code>setaf</code>, this scheme steals the
darkest 7 blues, not including black, and uses them for compatibility
with the basic ANSI 8 colors. Otherwise, there’s a risk of legacy
programs outputting barely-visible dark blues instead of the ANSI
colors they expect.</p>

<p>One consequence is that the <code>-direct</code> schemes are incompatible with
the <code>-256color</code> schemes, so programs must be aware that 256 colors
means indexed and 16.7 million means direct, except that the darkest 7
blues are to be avoided.</p>

<p>Fundamentally, terminfo has no notion of color space. So a program
that was written before terminfo even supported more colors than 256
might (validly!) assume the values of the first 8, 16, or even 256
palette entries.</p>

<p>This explains an issue with the Rust crate
<a href="https://docs.rs/termwiz/latest/termwiz/">termwiz</a> that I <a href="https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/4528">recently
ran into</a> at work. A
<a href="https://sapling-scm.com/">program</a> expected to output colors in the
xterm-256color palette, but was actually generating various
illegibly-dark shades of blue. (Note: Despite the fact that the issue
is open as of this writing, @quark-zju landed a fix, so current
termwiz behaves reasonably.)</p>

<p>This is a terminfo restriction, not a terminal restriction. As far as
I know, every terminal that supports 24-bit color also supports the
xterm 256-color palette and even dynamically changing their RGB
values. (You can even <a href="https://gist.github.com/chadaustin/7046bff2261b0f669d223a88ecad8282">animate the
palette</a>
like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMcJ1Jvtef0">The Secret of Monkey Island
did</a>!) While I appreciate
Thomas Dickey’s dedication to accurately documenting history and
preserving compatibility, terminfo simply isn’t great at accurate and
timely descriptions of today’s vibrant ecosystem of terminal
emulators.</p>

<p>Kovid Goyal, author of <a href="https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/">kitty</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/4172#issuecomment-955190343">expresses his
frustration</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To summarize, one cannot have both 256 and direct color support in
one terminfo file.</p>

  <p>Frustrated users of the ncurses library have only themselves to
blame, for choosing to use such a bad library.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A deeper, more accurate discussion of the challenges are documented in
<a href="https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/879">kitty issue #879</a>.</p>

<p>In an ideal world, terminfo would have introduced a brand new
capability for 24-bit RGB, leaving the adjustable 256-color palette in
place.</p>

<p>Modern programs should probably disregard most of terminfo and assume
that 16.7 million colors implies support for the rest of the color
capabilities. And maybe generate their own ANSI-compatible escape
sequences… except for the next wrinkle.</p>

<h2 id="setting-term-semicolons-again">Setting TERM: Semicolons Again!</h2>

<p>Gripes about terminfo aside, everyone uses it, so we do need to ensure
TERM is set correctly.</p>

<p>While I’d like to standardize on the colon-based SGR syntax, several
terminals I use only support semicolons:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/console/definitions#console-host">Conhost</a>,
Windows’s built-in console.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/mintty/mintty/wiki/Changelog#370-14-november-2023">Mintty</a>
<a href="https://github.com/mintty/mintty/wiki/Changelog#370-14-november-2023">claims to
work</a>
(and <a href="https://github.com/mintty/wsltty">wsltty</a> does), but for some
reason running <a href="https://gist.github.com/chadaustin/2d2c2cb4b71fd1d4163aa8115077624a">my colortest.rs
program</a>
from Cygwin only works with semicolon syntax, unless I pipe the
output through <code>cat</code> or a file. There must be some kind of magic
translation happening under the hood. I haven’t debugged.</li>
  <li><a href="https://mosh.org/">Mosh</a> is aware, but hasn’t <a href="https://github.com/mobile-shell/mosh/issues/951">added
support</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/">PuTTY</a>.</li>
  <li>Ubuntu 22.04 LTS ships a version of Konsole that only supports
semicolons.</li>
</ul>

<p>Terminfo entries are built from “building blocks”, marked with a plus.
<a href="https://invisible-island.net/ncurses/terminfo.src.html#tic-xterm_direct"><code>xterm+direct</code></a>
is the building block for the standard colon-delimited syntax.
<a href="https://invisible-island.net/ncurses/terminfo.src.html#tic-xterm_indirect"><code>xterm+indirect</code></a>
is the building block for legacy terminals that only support semicolon
syntax.</p>

<p>Searching for <code>xterm+indirect</code> shows which terminfo entries might work
for me. <code>vscode-direct</code> looks the most accurate. I assume that, since
it targets a Microsoft terminal, it’s probably close enough in
functionality to Windows Terminal and Windows Console. I have not
audited all capabilities, but it seems to work.</p>

<p>The next issue was that none of my servers had the <code>-direct</code> terminfo
entries installed! On most systems, the terminfo database comes from
the
<a href="https://packages.ubuntu.com/jammy/all/ncurses-base/filelist"><code>ncurses-base</code></a>
package, but you need
<a href="https://packages.ubuntu.com/jammy/all/ncurses-term/filelist"><code>ncurses-term</code></a>
for the extended set of terminals.</p>

<p>At work, we can configure a default set of installed packages for your
hosts, but I have to install them manually on my unmanaged personal
home machines. Also, I was still running Ubuntu 18, so I had to
upgrade to a version that contained the <code>-direct</code> terminfo entries.
(Of course, two of my headless machines failed to boot after
upgrading, but that’s a different story.)</p>

<p><del>Unfortunately, there is no terminfo entry for the Windows console.</del>
Since I started writing this post, ncurses introduced a
<a href="https://invisible-island.net/ncurses/NEWS.html#index-t20231230">winconsole</a>
terminfo entry, but it neither supports 24-bit color nor is released
in any ncurses version.</p>

<h2 id="configuring-emacs">Configuring Emacs</h2>

<p>Emacs documents <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/efaq/Colors-on-a-TTY.html">how it detects truecolor
support</a>.</p>

<p>I find it helpful to <code>M-x eval-expression</code> <code>(display-color-cells)</code> to
confirm whether Emacs sees 16.7 million colors.</p>

<p>Emacs also documents the <code>-direct</code> mode terminfo limitation described
above:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Terminals with ‘RGB’ capability treat pixels #000001 - #000007 as
indexed colors to maintain backward compatibility with applications
that are unaware of direct color mode. Therefore the seven darkest
blue shades may not be available. If this is a problem, you can
always use custom terminal definition with ‘setb24’ and ‘setf24’.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s worth noting that <code>RGB</code> is Emacs’s fallback capability. Emacs
looks for the <code>setf24</code> and <code>setb24</code> strings first, but no terminfo
entries on my machine contain those capabilities:</p>

<div><pre><code>$ for t in $(toe -a | cut -f1); do
    if (infocmp "$t" | grep 'setf24') &gt; /dev/null; then
      echo "$t";
    fi;
done
$
</code></pre></div>

<h2 id="nesting-terminals">Nesting Terminals</h2>

<div><pre><code>conhost.exe (WSL1)
+-------------------------+
| mosh                    |
| +---------------------+ |
| | tmux                | |
| | +-----------------+ | |
| | | emacs terminal  | | |
| | | +-------------+ | | |

| | | | foo bar baz | | | |
| | | +-------------+ | | |
| | +-----------------+ | |
| +---------------------+ |
+-------------------------+
</code></pre></div>

<p>I’d never consciously considered this, but my typical workflow nests
multiple terminals.</p>
<ul>
  <li>I open a graphical terminal emulator on my local desktop, Windows,
Mac, or Linux.</li>
  <li>I mosh to a remote machine or VM.</li>
  <li>I start tmux.</li>
  <li>I might then use a terminal within Emacs or
<a href="https://asciinema.org/">Asciinema</a> or <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/">GNU
Screen</a>.
    <ul>
      <li>Yes, there are situations where it’s useful to have some screen
sessions running inside or outside of tmux.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Each of those layers is its own implementation of the ANSI escape
sequence state machine. For 24-bit color to work, every single layer
has to understand and accurately translate the escape sequences from
the inner TERM value’s terminfo to the outer terminfo.</p>

<p>Therefore, you need recent-enough versions of all of this software.
Current LTS Ubuntus only ship with mosh 1.3, so I had to enable the
<a href="https://launchpad.net/~keithw/+archive/ubuntu/mosh-dev">mosh-dev
PPA</a>.</p>

<p>TERM must be set correctly within each terminal: <code>tmux-direct</code> within
tmux, for example. There is no standard terminfo for <code>mosh</code>, so you
have to pick something close enough.</p>

<h3 id="graphical-terminal-emulators">Graphical Terminal Emulators</h3>

<p>Most terminals either set TERM to a reasonable default or
allow you to override TERM.</p>

<p>I use Konsole, but I think you could find a similar option in
whichever you use.</p>

<figure>
<a href="https://chadaustin.me/images/truecolor-terminal-emacs/konsole.png"><img src="https://chadaustin.me/images/truecolor-terminal-emacs/konsole.png" alt="Konsole's TERM value selection"></a>
<figcaption>Konsole's TERM value selection</figcaption>
</figure>

<h3 id="ssh">ssh</h3>

<p>Often, the first thing I do when opening a terminal is to <code>ssh</code>
somewhere else. Fortunately, this is easy, as long as the remote host
has the same terminfo record. <code>ssh</code> carries your TERM value into the
new shell.</p>

<h3 id="tmux">tmux</h3>

<p>But then you load <code>tmux</code> and TERM is set to <code>screen</code>! To fix this,
override <code>default-terminal</code> in your <code>~/.tmux.conf</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code>set -g default-terminal "tmux-direct"
</code></pre></div>

<p>For extra credit, consider setting <code>tmux-direct</code> conditionally with
<code>%if</code> when the outer TERM supports 24-bit color, otherwise leaving the
default of <code>screen</code> or <code>tmux-256color</code>. And then let me know how you
did it. :P</p>

<h3 id="mosh">mosh</h3>

<p>While recent mosh does support 24-bit color, it <a href="https://github.com/mobile-shell/mosh/blob/1105d481bb9143dad43adf768f58da7b029fd39c/src/frontend/mosh-server.cc#L571">only advertises 8 or
256
colors</a>.
Thus, it’s up to you to set TERM appropriately.</p>

<p>Mosh aims for xterm compatibility, but unfortunately only supports
semicolon syntax for SGR 38 and 48, so <code>TERM=xterm-direct</code> does not
work. So far, I’ve found that <code>vscode-direct</code> is the closest to
<code>xterm-direct</code>.</p>

<p>There is no convenient “I’m running in mosh” variable, so I wrote a
<a href="https://gist.github.com/chadaustin/ee1a20e0522c10b65cb4006496d1fb7c"><code>detect-mosh.rs</code></a>
Rust script and called it from <code>.bashrc</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code>unamer=$(uname -r)
unameo=$(uname -o)
if [[ ! "$TMUX" ]]; then
    if [[ "$unamer" == *Microsoft ]]; then
        # WSL 1
        export TERM=vscode-direct
    elif [[ "$unameo" == Cygwin ]]; then
        # Eh, could just configure mintty to set mintty-direct.
        export TERM=vscode-direct
    elif detect-mosh 2&gt;/dev/null; then
        # This should be xterm-direct, but mosh does not understand SGR
        # colon syntax.
        export TERM=vscode-direct
    fi
fi
</code></pre></div>

<p>It works by checking whether the shell process is a child of
<code>mosh-server</code>.</p>

<p>The jury’s still out on whether it’s a good idea to compile Rust in
the critical path of login, especially into an underpowered host like
my Intel Atom NAS or a Raspberry Pi.</p>

<h2 id="it-works">It Works!</h2>

<p>Beautiful Emacs themes everywhere!</p>

<figure>
<a href="https://chadaustin.me/images/truecolor-terminal-emacs/finally.png"><img src="https://chadaustin.me/images/truecolor-terminal-emacs/finally.png" alt="Emacs within tmux within mosh"></a>
<figcaption>Emacs within tmux within mosh</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This was a ton of work, but I learned a lot, and, perhaps most
importantly, I now feel confident I could debug any kind of wonky
terminal behavior in the future.</p>

<p>To recap:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Terminals don’t agree on syntax and capabilities.</li>
  <li>Terminfo is how those capabilities are queried.</li>
  <li>Terminfo is often limited, sometimes inaccurate, and new terminfo
versions are released infrequently.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="whats-next">What’s Next?</h2>

<p>If you were serious about writing software to take full advantage of
modern terminal capabilities, it would be time to break from terminfo.</p>

<p>I imagine such a project would look like this:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Continue to use the TERM variable because it’s well-supported.</li>
  <li>Give programs knowledge of terminals independent of the age of the
operating system or distribution they’re running on:
    <ul>
      <li>Programs would link with a frequently-updated (Rust?) library.</li>
      <li>Said library would contain a (modern!) terminfo database
representing, say, the last 10 years of terminal emulators, keyed
on (name, version). Notably, the library would not pretend to
support any hardware terminals, because they no longer exist. We
can safely forget about
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/termutils/manual/termcap-1.3/html_mono/termcap.html#SEC7">padding</a>,
for example.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Continue to support the terminfo file format and OS-provided
terminfo files on disk, with some protocol for determining which
information is most-up-to-date.</li>
  <li>Allow an opt-in TERMVERSION to differentiate between the
capabilities of, for example, 2022’s Konsole and 2023’s Konsole.</li>
  <li>Allow describing modern terminal capabilities (like 24-bit color,
256-color palette animation, <a href="https://github.com/Alhadis/OSC8-Adoption/">URL
links</a>, <a href="https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/graphics-protocol/">Kitty’s graphics
protocol</a>) in an
accurate, unambiguous format, independent of the timeline of new
ncurses releases.</li>
  <li>Backport modern terminal descriptions to legacy programs by
providing a program to be run by <code>.bashrc</code> that:
    <ul>
      <li>Uses TERM and TERMVERSION to generate a binary terminfo file in
<code>$HOME/.terminfo/</code>, which ncurses knows how to discover.</li>
      <li>Generates unambiguous 24-bit color capabilities like <code>RGB</code>,
<code>setf24</code>, and <code>setb24</code>, despite the fact that getting them added
to terminfo has been politically untenable.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, assumes RGB-unaware programs will assume the 256-color
palette, and leaves <code>colors#0x100</code>, <code>initc</code>, <code>oc</code> in place.
Palette animation is a useful, widely-supported feature.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Let me know if you’re interested in such a project!</p>

<p>Sure, the <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2022/09/09/yet-another-data-broker-found-to-give-massive-amounts-of-location-info-to-law-enforcement/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2022/09/09/yet-another-data-broker-found-to-give-massive-amounts-of-location-info-to-law-enforcement/">government can pretend</a> the Third Party Doctrine applies here. But chances are that most of this data being collected by phone apps and other services isn’t being collected with the full knowledge of device users. This is the sort of thing that’s hidden in the deep end of Terms of Use boilerplate, suckering people out of all kinds of data because they made the mistake of assuming a seemingly-innocuous match-3 game wouldn’t attempt to ping their phone’s location and tie it to specific device IDs. </p>
<p>So, this latest news — <a href="https://www.wyden.senate.gov/news/press-releases/wyden-releases-documents-confirming-the-nsa-buys-americans-internet-browsing-records-calls-on-intelligence-community-to-stop-buying-us-data-obtained-unlawfully-from-data-brokers-violating-recent-ftc-order" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.wyden.senate.gov/news/press-releases/wyden-releases-documents-confirming-the-nsa-buys-americans-internet-browsing-records-calls-on-intelligence-community-to-stop-buying-us-data-obtained-unlawfully-from-data-brokers-violating-recent-ftc-order">as revealed by Senator Ron Wyden</a> — is only surprising in terms of which agency is involved. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>U.S. Senator Ron Wyden, D-Ore., released documents confirming the National Security Agency buys Americans’ internet records, which can reveal which websites they visit and what apps they use. In response to the revelation, today Wyden called on the administration to ensure intelligence agencies stop buying personal data from Americans that has been obtained illegally by data brokers. A recent FTC order held that data brokers must obtain Americans’ informed consent before selling their data.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>“The U.S. government should not be funding and legitimizing a shady industry whose flagrant violations of Americans’ privacy are not just unethical, but illegal,” Wyden wrote in a letter to Director of National Intelligence (DNI) Avril Haines today. “To that end, I request that you adopt a policy that, going forward, IC elements may only purchase data about Americans that meets the standard for legal data sales established by the FTC.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You’d think the NSA would be able to obtain this data without having to buy it from sketchy third-party vendors. I mean, it has erected one of the most pervasive surveillance apparatuses in the world. It’s completely capable of engaging in domestic surveillance. And, indeed, it often does! So why would it need to purchase something it can obtain (more legitimately[?]) from its own dragnets and risk having part of its collection techniques exposed? </p>
<p>There’s no clear answer to that question, other than it’s pretty easy to spend government money when you’ve got plenty of it. Wyden’s <a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/24389005/wyden-nsa.pdf" data-type="link" data-id="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/24389005/wyden-nsa.pdf">letter</a> [PDF] goes into a bit more detail, but (for obvious reason) it’s not the equivalent of sneaking damning documents out of an NSA data center and handing them over to journalists after exiting the country.</p>
<p>That being said, it took Wyden holding a top NSA position hostage for the government to admit it was buying data from brokers to engage in domestic surveillance. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The secrecy around data purchases was amplified because intelligence agencies have sought to keep the American people in the dark. It took me nearly three years to clear the public release of information revealing the NSA’s purchase of domestic internet metadata. DoD first provided me with that information in March, 2021, in response to a request from my office for information identifying the DoD components buying Americans’ personal data. DoD subsequently refused a request I made in May, 2021, to clear the unclassified information for public release. It was only after I placed a hold on the nominee to be the NSA director that this information was cleared for release.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wyden asks each “IC [Intelligence Community] element” to open an investigation into the purchase of data from data brokers, as well as an FTC investigation into the business practices of the data brokers themselves. Each IC component is also asked to provide “an inventory of personal data purchased” from data brokers.</p>
<p>Wyden’s letter deals with all data purchased from brokers, but specifically exposes the NSA’s acquisition of internet browser records, which show which sites users visit and which apps they use. The NSA’s denial — delivered to Wyden late last year — claims the NSA isn’t doing something else entirely. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>[N]SA does not buy and use location data collected from phones known to be used in the United States either with or without a court order. </em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s the only firm denial in the letter and it only says things about location data, which isn’t what Wyden is expressing his concern about. </p>
<p>However, the NSA — in the same 2023 letter — admitted to doing exactly what Wyden accused it of: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>NSA does buy and use commercially available netflow (i.e., non-content) data related wholly to domestic internet communications and internet communications where one side of the communication is a U.S. Internet Protocol address and the other is located abroad. </em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The NSA is admitting to domestic surveillance. Not the best look for an agency still hoping to resuscitate its reputation following several years of damning leaks, investigations, and inadvertent exposures. We already know the NSA is fully capable of <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2014/06/30/fbi-cia-also-make-use-backdoor-searches-nsa-data-to-access-us-communications-without-warrant/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2014/06/30/fbi-cia-also-make-use-backdoor-searches-nsa-data-to-access-us-communications-without-warrant/">“inadvertently” sweeping up</a> US persons’ data and communications with its Section 702 collection. That’s the thing <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/05/17/for-the-first-time-in-probably-ever-the-fbi-section-702-abuses-are-trending-downward/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/05/17/for-the-first-time-in-probably-ever-the-fbi-section-702-abuses-are-trending-downward/">the FBI constantly abuses</a> to engage in domestic surveillance. It should never need to buy this data from brokers because it has always been able to obtain it otherwise. </p>
<p>This appears to be the NSA <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2013/07/15/nsa-bosses-mantra-who-cares-what-law-says-collect-it-all/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2013/07/15/nsa-bosses-mantra-who-cares-what-law-says-collect-it-all/">collecting even <em>more</em></a> just because the situation presented itself, rather than for any demonstrated national security need. And that’s the sort of thing no American should be willing to treat as government business as usual. </p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="page-wrapper">

            <div id="content" class="page">

<p><img src="https://skyzh.github.io/mini-lsm/mini-lsm-logo.png" alt="Banner"></p>
<p>In this tutorial, you will learn how to build a simple LSM-Tree storage engine in the Rust programming language.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-lsm-and-why-lsm"><a href="#what-is-lsm-and-why-lsm">What is LSM, and Why LSM?</a></h2>
<p>Log-structured merge tree is a data structure to maintain key-value pairs. This data structure is widely used in
distributed database systems like <a href="https://www.pingcap.com/">TiDB</a> and <a href="https://www.cockroachlabs.com/">CockroachDB</a> as
their underlying storage engine. <a href="http://rocksdb.org/">RocksDB</a>, based on <a href="https://github.com/google/leveldb">LevelDB</a>,
is an implementation of LSM-Tree storage engine. It provides a wide range of key-value access functionalities and is
used in a lot of production systems.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, LSM Tree is an append-friendly data structure. It is more intuitive to compare LSM to other
key-value data structure like RB-Tree and B-Tree. For RB-Tree and B-Tree, all data operations are in-place. That is to
say, when you update the value corresponding to the key, the value will be overwritten at its original memory or disk
space. But in an LSM Tree, all write operations, i.e., insertions, updates, deletions, are performed in somewhere else.
These operations will be batched into SST (sorted string table) files and be written to the disk. Once written to the
disk, the file will not be changed. These operations are applied lazily on disk with a special task called compaction.
The compaction job will merge multiple SST files and remove unused data.</p>
<p>This architectural design makes LSM tree easy to work with.</p>
<ol>
<li>Data are immutable on persistent storage, which means that it is easier to offload the background tasks (compaction)
to remote servers. It is also feasible to directly store and serve data from cloud-native storage systems like S3.</li>
<li>An LSM tree can balance between read, write and space amplification by changing the compaction algorithm. The data
structure itself is super versatile and can be optimized for different workloads.</li>
</ol>
<p>In this tutorial, we will learn how to build an LSM-Tree-based storage engine in the Rust programming language.</p>
<h2 id="prerequisites"><a href="#prerequisites">Prerequisites</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>You should know the basics of the Rust programming language. Reading <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/">the Rust book</a>
is enough.</li>
<li>You should know the basic concepts of key-value storage engines, i.e., why we need somehow complex design to achieve
persistence. If you have no experience with database systems and storage systems before, you can implement Bitcask
in <a href="https://github.com/pingcap/talent-plan/tree/master/courses/rust/projects/project-2">PingCAP Talent Plan</a>.</li>
<li>Knowing the basics of an LSM tree is not a requirement but we recommend you to read something about it, e.g., the 
overall idea of LevelDB. This would familiarize you with concepts like mutable and immutable mem-tables, SST,
compaction, WAL, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-should-you-expect-from-this-tutorial"><a href="#what-should-you-expect-from-this-tutorial">What should you expect from this tutorial...</a></h2>
<p>After learning this course, you should have a deep understanding of how a LSM-based storage system works, gain hands-on experience of designing such systems, and apply what you have learned in your study and career. You will understand the design tradeoffs in such storage systems and find optimal ways to design a LSM-based storage system to meet your workload requirements/goals. This is a very in-depth tutorial that covers all the important implementation details and design choices of modern storage systems (i.e., RocksDB) based on the author's experience in several LSM-like storage systems, and you will be able to directly apply what you have learned in both industry and academia.</p>
<h3 id="structure"><a href="#structure">Structure</a></h3>
<p>The tutorial is a large course that is split into several parts (weeks). Each week usually has seven chapters, and each of the chapter can be finished within 2-3 hours. The first six chapters of each part will instruct you to build a working system, and the last chapter of each week will be a <em>snack time</em> chapter that implements some easy things over what you have built in the previous six days. In each chapter, there will be required tasks, <em>check you understanding</em> questions, and bonus tasks.</p>
<h3 id="testing"><a href="#testing">Testing</a></h3>
<p>We provide full test suite and some cli tools for you to validate if your solution is correct. Note that the test suite is not exhaustive, and your solution might not be 100% correct after passing all test cases. You might need to fix earlier bugs when implementing later parts of the system. We recommend you to think thoroughly about your implementation, especially when there are multi-thread operations and race conditions.</p>
<h3 id="solution"><a href="#solution">Solution</a></h3>
<p>We have a solution that implements all the functionalities as required in the tutorial in the mini-lsm main repo. At the same time, we also have a mini-lsm solution checkpoint repo where each commit corresponds to a chapter in the tutorial. </p>
<p>Keeping such checkpoint repo up-to-date to the mini-lsm tutorial is hard because each bug fix or new feature will need to go through all commits (or checkpoints). Therefore, this repo might not be using the latest starter code or incorporating the latest features from the mini-lsm tutorial.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR: We do not guarantee the solution checkpoint repo contains a correct solution, passes all tests, or has the correct doc comments.</strong> For a correct implementation and the solution after implementing all things, please take a look at the solution in the main repo instead. <a href="https://github.com/skyzh/mini-lsm/tree/main/mini-lsm">https://github.com/skyzh/mini-lsm/tree/main/mini-lsm</a>.</p>
<p>If you are stuck at some part of the tutorial or do not know where to implement a functionality, you can refer to this repo for help. You may compare the diff between commits to know what has been changed. Some functions in the mini-lsm tutorial might be changed multiple times throughout the chapters, and you can know what exactly are expected to be implemented for each chapter in this repo.</p>

<h3 id="feedbacks"><a href="#feedbacks">Feedbacks</a></h3>
<p>Your feedback is greatly appreciated. We have rewritten the whole course from scratch in 2024 based on the feedbacks from the students. We hope you can share your learning experience and help us continuously improve the tutorial. Welcome to the <a href="https://skyzh.dev/join/discord">Discord community</a> and share your experience.</p>
<p>The long story of why we rewrote it: The tutorial was originally planned as a general guidance that students start from an empty directory and implement whatever they want based on the specification we had. We had minimal tests that checks if the behavior is correct. However, the original tutorial is too open-ended that caused huge obstacles with the learning experience. As students do not have an overview of the whole system beforehand and the instructions are kind of vague, sometimes it is hard for the students to know why a design decision is made and what they need to achieve a goal. And some part of the course is too compact that it is impossible to deliver expected contents within just one chapter. Therefore, we completely redesigned the course to have a easier learning curve and clearer learning goals. The original one-week tutorial is now split into two weeks (first week on storage format, and second week on deep-dive compaction), with an extra part on MVCC. We hope you find this course interesting and helpful in your study and career. We would like to thank everyone who commented in <a href="https://github.com/skyzh/mini-lsm/issues/11">Feedback after coding day 1</a> and <a href="https://github.com/skyzh/mini-lsm/issues/7">Hello, when is the next update plan for the tutorial?</a> -- your feedback greatly helped us improve the course.</p>

<p>Yes! Everything publicly available now will be free forever and will receive lifetime updates and bug fixes. Meanwhile, we might provide paid code review and office hour services in the future. For the DLC part (<em>rest of your life</em> chapters), we do not have plans to finish them as of 2024, and have not decided whether they will be public available or not.</p>

<p>As of writing (at the beginning of 2024), Chi obtained his master's degree in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University and his bachelor's degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University. He has been working on a variety of database systems including <a href="https://github.com/tikv/tikv">TiKV</a>, <a href="https://github.com/tikv/agatedb">AgateDB</a>, <a href="https://github.com/bytedance/terarkdb">TerarkDB</a>, <a href="https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave">RisingWave</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/neondatabase/neon">Neon</a>. Since 2022, he worked as a teaching assistant for <a href="https://15445.courses.cs.cmu/">CMU's Database Systems course</a> for three semesters on the BusTub educational system, where he added a lot of new features and more challenges to the course (check out the re-designed <a href="https://15445.courses.cs.cmu.edu/fall2022/project3/">query execution</a> project and the super challenging <a href="https://15445.courses.cs.cmu.edu/fall2023/project4/">multi-version concurrency control</a> project). Besides working on the BusTub educational system, he is also a maintainer of the <a href="https://github.com/risinglightdb/risinglight">RisingLight</a> educational database system. Chi is interested in exploring how the Rust programming language can fit in the database world. Check out his previous tutorial on building a vectorized expression framework <a href="https://github.com/skyzh/type-exercise-in-rust">type-exercise-in-rust</a> and on building a vector database <a href="https://github.com/skyzh/write-you-a-vector-db">write-you-a-vector-db</a> if you are also interested in that topic.</p>

  <p><span>tldr;</span> <i>An agricultural air cannon began firing every two minutes all night long disrupting the sleep of many in my community. I used Google Maps, three listening posts, and a programmed simulation to pinpoint the field hosting the air cannon. The county tax assessor office identified the land owner. I had a phone conversation with the farm manager. That conversation was coincident with the cessation of the nighttime air cannon. I can sleep again.</i></p>

</div><p>

The use of agricultural air cannons south of Corvallis has been extreme this month. Farmers with field crops are often beset with Canadian Geese overwintering in the Willamette Valley. To scare the geese away, they frequently use propane air cannons on timers. Starting on January 5th, an air cannon began firing every two minutes all day and throughout the night. My sleep and that of many neighbors was disrupted for nearly a month.

</p><p>Trying to figure out where the cannon shots originated, I drove out and listened from several locations. It was loud on Airport Road, Bellfountain Rd, 53rd St, Plymouth Dr, Nash Ave, Brooklane Dr, Wake Robin Road, Rivergreen Ave and as far north as the Benton County Fair Grounds.  It was silent anywhere south of Llewellyn Rd.  Trying to get a heading for the sound with just my ears and a compass was way more difficult than I expected.</p>

      <p><i>The Corvallis Airport<br>looking South</i>
  </p>
</div>

<p>All indications were that the sound was coming from the area of the airport, but I could not pin it down any more accurately. The airport staff denied using an air cannon. However, they indicated that they could hear one to the south.</p>  

<p>The most easily identifiable farm south of the airport was Venell Farms.  They fervently denied they were using an air cannon. </p> 

<p>That left a big chunk of land south and west of the airport that was not crossed by public roads. Not willing to trespass to find the source, I needed a new strategy. </p>

</div><p>After some deep thought, I theorized I could pinpoint the location of the air cannon by logging the arrival times of the sound from three locations.  It took three people stationed at remote locations miles apart using a synchronized clock on our cell phones. We each waited over the same ten minute period, noting the exact time for each of the five cannon shots that we heard. </p>  

<p>The sound arrived at our Bellfountain Rd location first. About four seconds later, the sound arrived at our Brooklane Dr. lookout.  Two seconds later, it arrived at our Rivergreen Ave listening post.</p> 

<p>I took a screen capture of a Google Map of our area with a measurement line on the map for scale. I plotted our three listening locations. The scale allowed us to figure out how far apart our test locations were and facilitated a method for translating back and forth between the image coordinate system and the real world coordinate system.</p>

<p>I wrote a program in Python (<a href="#source">see source code below</a>) that could iterate all the points in the image in the search area where we suspected the air cannon sat. Translating those image points to real world coordinates, I used the speed of sound at 35℉ to calculate the travel time to each of our three listening posts. Comparing the arrival times of the simulated sounds, I could match them with the deltas from the real observations. Once my program scanned and tested every point on the south half of the map image, it identified a point that exactly replicated the deltas. I knew I found the only possible origin of the sound and therefore the location of the air cannon. I translated my grid system back to real world coordinates and plotted it on my map. That identified the offending farm field.</p>

  </p>

<p>I went to the County Tax Assessor Office to find the owner of the property. With a company name, I found a Web site and a phone number.</p> 

<p>I called the owner of the farm (headquartered in Monmouth) and asked if they used an air cannon on their property near the Corvallis airport. They confirmed that they do. I asked if they run it at night, they said they do not. However, the manager said that he'd contact the people working onsite.  Twenty minutes later, he called back reaffirming they are not running their cannons at night.  He also assured me that their air cannons could not be heard more than a mile away.  The air cannon that we tracked to his farm was clearly audible 6 miles away from the Benton County Fairgrounds. I did not trust his knowledge of his own equipment nor how it was used by the onsite staff.</p> 

<p>However, in an amazing coincidence, the air cannons stopped that very evening of our phone conversation (Thursday, January 25). The air cannons have fallen silent at night since that day.  I suspect that the cessation was not a random correlation.  I surmise that they actually were using the cannon at night and the manager stopped the practice.</p> 

<p>It was a miserable twenty days of ruined sleep. I found threads about the air cannon on Facebook, Reddit, Twitter/X and Nextdoor. How many people in Corvallis and Philomath were disrupted?</p> 

<p>I’m refraining from revealing the name of the farm. I don’t want folk harassing them. I will say, though, it wasn’t Venell Farms as so many expected.</p> 

<p>Should the nighttime air cannon start up again, I have an easy tool to figure out its exact location from miles away. I will exercise this newly found power whenever I need it.</p>

<p>Put me on the short list of people who can get excited about the humble, much-derided integrated GPU.</p>
<p>Yes, most of them are afterthoughts, designed for office desktops and laptops that will spend most of their lives rendering 2D images to a single monitor. But when integrated graphics push forward, it can open up possibilities for people who want to play games but can only afford a cheap desktop (or who have to make do with whatever their parents will pay for, which was the big limiter on my PC gaming experience as a kid).</p>

<p>That, plus an unrelated but accordant interest in building small mini-ITX-based desktops, has kept me interested in AMD’s G-series Ryzen desktop chips (which it sometimes calls “APUs,” to distinguish them from the Ryzen CPUs). And the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/integrated-gpus-in-ryzen-8000g-desktop-cpus-compete-with-low-end-graphics-cards/">Ryzen 8000G chips</a> are a big upgrade from the 5000G series that immediately preceded them (this makes sense, because as we all know the number 8 immediately follows the number 5).</p>
<p>We’re jumping up an entire processor socket, one CPU architecture, three GPU architectures, and up to a new generation of much faster memory; especially for graphics, it’s a pretty dramatic leap. It’s an integrated GPU that can credibly beat the lowest tier of currently available graphics cards, replacing a $100–$200 part with something a lot more energy-efficient.</p>
<p>As with so many current-gen Ryzen chips, still-elevated pricing for the socket AM5 platform and the DDR5 memory it requires limit the 8000G series’ appeal, at least for now.</p>

<p>The 8000G chips use the same Zen 4 CPU architecture as the Ryzen 7000 desktop chips, but the way the rest of the chip is put together is pretty different. Like past APUs, these are actually laptop silicon (in this case, the Ryzen 7040/8040 series, codenamed Phoenix and Phoenix 2) repackaged for a desktop processor socket.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>Generally, the real-world impact of this is pretty mild; in most ways, the 8700G and 8600G will perform a lot like any other Zen 4 CPU with the same number of cores (our benchmarks mostly bear this out). But to the extent that there is a difference, the Phoenix silicon will consistently perform just a little worse, because it has half as much L3 cache. AMD’s Ryzen X3D chips revolve around the performance benefits of tons of cache, so you can see why having less would be detrimental.</p>
<p>The other missing feature from the Ryzen 7000 desktop chips is PCI Express 5.0 support—Ryzen 8000G tops out at PCIe 4.0. This might, maybe, one day in the distant future, eventually lead to some kind of user-observable performance difference. Some recent GPUs use an 8-lane PCIe 4.0 interface instead of the typical 16 lanes, which limits performance slightly. But PCIe 5.0 SSDs remain rare (and PCIe 4.0 peripherals remain extremely fast), so it probably shouldn’t top your list of concerns.</p>
<p>The Ryzen 5 8500G is a lot different from the 8700G and 8600G, since some of the CPU cores in the Phoenix 2 chips are based on <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/11/amd-starts-bringing-its-own-tiny-cpu-cores-to-new-ryzen-7040-laptop-chips/">Zen 4c</a> rather than Zen 4. These cores have all the same capabilities as regular Zen 4 ones—unlike Intel’s E-cores—but they’re optimized to take up less space rather than hit high clock speeds. They were initially made for servers, where cramming lots of cores into a small amount of space is more important than having a smaller number of faster cores, but AMD is also using them to make some of its low-end consumer chips physically smaller and presumably cheaper to produce. AMD didn’t send us a Ryzen 8500G for review, so we can’t see exactly how Phoenix 2 stacks up in a desktop.</p>
<p>The 8700G and 8600G chips are also the only ones that come with AMD’s “Ryzen AI” feature, the brand AMD is using to refer to processors with a neural processing unit (NPU) included. Sort of like GPUs or video encoding/decoding blocks, these are additional bits built into the chip that handle things that CPUs can’t do very efficiently—in this case, machine learning and AI workloads.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>Most PCs still don’t have NPUs, and as such they are only barely used in current versions of Windows (Windows 11 offers some webcam effects that will take advantage of NPU acceleration, but for now that’s mostly it). But expect this to change as they become more common and as more AI-accelerated text, image, and video creating and editing capabilities are built into modern operating systems.</p>

<p>The last major difference is the GPU. Ryzen 7000 includes a pair of RDNA2 compute units that perform more or less like Intel’s desktop integrated graphics: good enough to render your desktop on a monitor or two, but not much else. The Ryzen 8000G chips include up to 12 RDNA3 CUs, which—as we’ve already seen in laptops and portable gaming systems like the Asus ROG Ally that use the same silicon—is enough to run most games, if just barely in some cases.</p>
<p>That gives AMD’s desktop APUs a unique niche. You can use them in cases where you can’t afford a dedicated GPU—for a time during the big graphics card shortage in 2020 and 2021, a Ryzen 5700G was actually one of the only ways to build a budget gaming PC. Or you can use them in cases where a dedicated GPU won’t fit, like super-small mini ITX-based desktops.</p>
<p>The main argument that AMD makes is the affordability one, comparing the price of a Ryzen 8700G to the price of an Intel Core i5-13400F and a GeForce GTX 1650 GPU (this card is nearly five years old, but it remains Nvidia’s newest and best GPU available for less than $200).</p>
<p>Let’s check on performance first, and then we’ll revisit pricing.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p id="speakable-summary">Mercedes-Benz accidentally exposed a trove of internal data after leaving a private key online that gave “unrestricted access” to the company’s source code, according to the security research firm that discovered it.</p>
<p>Shubham Mittal, co-founder and chief technology officer of RedHunt Labs, alerted TechCrunch to the exposure and asked for help in disclosing to the car maker. The London-based cybersecurity company said it discovered a Mercedes employee’s authentication token in a public GitHub repository during a routine internet scan in January.</p>
<p>According to Mittal, this token — an alternative to using a password for authenticating to GitHub — could grant anyone full access to Mercedes’s GitHub Enterprise Server, thus allowing the download of the company’s private source code repositories.</p>
<p>“The GitHub token gave ‘unrestricted’ and ‘unmonitored’ access to the entire source code hosted at the internal GitHub Enterprise Server,” Mittal explained in a report shared by TechCrunch. “The repositories include a large amount of intellectual property… connection strings, cloud access keys, blueprints, design documents, [single sign-on] passwords, API Keys, and other critical internal information.”</p>
<p>Mittal provided TechCrunch with evidence that&nbsp;the exposed repositories contained Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services (AWS) keys, a Postgres database, and Mercedes source code. It’s not known if any customer data was contained within the repositories.</p>
<p>TechCrunch disclosed the security issue to Mercedes on Monday. On Wednesday, Mercedes spokesperson Katja Liesenfeld confirmed that the company “revoked the respective API token and removed the public repository immediately.”</p>
<p>“We can confirm that internal source code was published on a public GitHub repository by human error,” Liesenfeld said in a statement to TechCrunch. “The security of our organization, products, and services is one of our top priorities.”</p>
<p>“We will continue to analyze this case according to our normal processes. Depending on this, we implement remedial measures,” Liesenfeld added.</p>
<p>It’s not known if anyone else besides Mittal discovered the exposed key, which was published in late-September 2023.</p>
<p>Mercedes declined to say whether it is aware of any third-party access to the exposed data or whether the company has the technical ability, such as access logs, to determine if there was any improper access to its data repositories. The spokesperson cited unspecified security reasons.</p>
<p>Last week,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/11/hyundai-motor-india-data-exposed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TechCrunch exclusively reported that Hyundai’s India subsidiary fixed a bug</a> that exposed its customers’ personal information, including the names, mailing addresses, email addresses and phone numbers of Hyundai Motor India customers, who had their vehicles serviced at Hyundai-owned stations across India.</p>

                                        <p>ANGOLA, La. (AP) — A hidden path to America’s dinner tables begins here, at an unlikely source – a former Southern slave plantation that is now the country’s largest maximum-security prison.</p><p>Unmarked trucks packed with prison-raised cattle roll out of the Louisiana State Penitentiary, where men are sentenced to hard labor and forced to work, for pennies an hour or sometimes nothing at all. After rumbling down a country road to an auction house, the cows are bought by a local rancher and then followed by The Associated Press another 600 miles to a Texas slaughterhouse that feeds into the supply chains of giants like McDonald’s, Walmart and Cargill.</p><p>Intricate, invisible webs, just like this one, link some of the world’s largest food companies and most popular brands to jobs performed by U.S. prisoners nationwide, according to a sweeping two-year AP investigation into prison labor that tied hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of agricultural products to goods sold on the open market. </p><p>They are among America’s most vulnerable laborers. If they refuse to work, some can jeopardize their chances of parole or face punishment like being sent to solitary confinement. They also are often excluded from protections guaranteed to almost all other full-time workers, even when they are seriously injured or killed on the job. </p><div data-align-fullwidth="">

                </div><p>Willie Ingram picked everything from cotton to okra during his 51 years in the state penitentiary, better known as Angola.</p><p>During his time in the fields, he was overseen by armed guards on horseback and recalled seeing men, working with little or no water, passing out in triple-digit heat. Some days, he said, workers would throw their tools in the air to protest, despite knowing the potential consequences. </p><p>“They’d come, maybe four in the truck, shields over their face, billy clubs, and they’d beat you right there in the field. They beat you, handcuff you and beat you again,” said Ingram, who received a life sentence after pleading guilty to a crime he said he didn’t commit. He was told he would serve 10 ½ years and avoid a possible death penalty, but it wasn’t until 2021 that a sympathetic judge finally released him. He was 73. </p><p>The number of people behind bars in the United States started to soar in the 1970s just as Ingram entered the system, disproportionately hitting people of color. Now, with about 2 million people locked up, U.S. prison labor from all sectors has morphed into a multibillion-dollar empire, extending far beyond the classic images of prisoners stamping license plates, working on road crews or battling wildfires. </p><h2>Photo Gallery: Some prisoners earn pennies or nothing at all</h2><div data-align-center="" data-carousel-enhancement="">

        </div><p>Though almost every state has some kind of farming program, agriculture represents only a small fraction of the overall prison workforce. Still, an analysis of data amassed by the AP from correctional facilities nationwide traced nearly $200 million worth of sales of farmed goods and livestock to businesses over the past six years – a conservative figure that does not include tens of millions more in sales to state and government entities. Much of the data provided was incomplete, though it was clear that the biggest revenues came from sprawling operations in the South and leasing out prisoners to companies.</p><p>Corrections officials and other proponents note that not all work is forced and that prison jobs save taxpayers money. For example, in some cases, the food produced is served in prison kitchens or donated to those in need outside. They also say workers are learning skills that can be used when they’re released and given a sense of purpose, which could help ward off repeat offenses. In some places, it allows prisoners to also shave time off their sentences. And the jobs provide a way to repay a debt to society, they say.</p><p>While most critics don’t believe all jobs should be eliminated, they say incarcerated people should be paid fairly, treated humanely and that all work should be voluntary. Some note that even when people get specialized training, like firefighting, their criminal records can make it almost impossible to get hired on the outside.</p><p>“They are largely uncompensated, they are being forced to work, and it’s unsafe. They also aren’t learning skills that will help them when they are released,” said law professor Andrea Armstrong, an expert on prison labor at Loyola University New Orleans. “It raises the question of why we are still forcing people to work in the fields.”</p><div data-align-fullwidth="">

                </div><h2>A SHADOW WORKFORCE WITH FEW PROTECTIONS</h2><p>In addition to tapping a cheap, reliable workforce, companies sometimes get tax credits and other financial incentives. Incarcerated workers also typically aren’t covered by the most basic protections, including workers’ compensation and federal safety standards. In many cases, they cannot file official complaints about poor working conditions.</p><p>These prisoners often work in industries with severe labor shortages, doing some of the country’s dirtiest and most dangerous jobs. </p><p>The AP sifted through thousands of pages of documents and spoke to more than 80 current or formerly incarcerated people, including men and women convicted of crimes that ranged from murder to shoplifting, writing bad checks, theft or other illegal acts linked to drug use. Some were given long sentences for nonviolent offenses because they had previous convictions, while others were released after proving their innocence.</p><p>Reporters found people who were hurt or maimed on the job, and also interviewed women who were sexually harassed or abused, sometimes by their civilian supervisors or the correctional officers overseeing them. While it’s often nearly impossible for those involved in workplace accidents to sue, the AP examined dozens of cases that managed to make their way into the court system. Reporters also spoke to family members of prisoners who were killed.</p><p>One of those was Frank Dwayne Ellington, who was sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole after stealing a man’s wallet at gunpoint – a result of Alabama’s habitual offenders act. In 2017, Ellington, 33, was cleaning a machine near the chicken “kill line” in Ashland at Koch Foods – one of the country’s biggest poultry-processing companies – when its whirling teeth caught his arm and sucked him inside, crushing his skull. He died instantly. </p><div data-align-right="">

                </div><p>During a yearslong legal battle, Koch Foods at first argued Ellington wasn’t technically an employee, and later said his family should be barred from filing for wrongful death because the company had paid his funeral expenses. The case eventually was settled under undisclosed terms. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration fined the company $19,500, saying workers had not been given proper training and that its machines had inadequate safety guards. </p><p>“It’s somebody’s child, it’s somebody’s dad, it’s somebody’s uncle, it’s somebody’s family,” said Ellington’s mother, Alishia Powell-Clark. “Yes, they did wrong, but they are paying for it.” </p><p>The AP found that U.S. prison labor is in the supply chains of goods being shipped all over the world via multinational companies, including to countries that have been slapped with import bans by Washington in recent years. For instance, the U.S. has blocked shipments of cotton coming from China, a top manufacturer of popular clothing brands, because it was produced by forced or prison labor. But crops harvested by U.S. prisoners have entered the supply chains of companies that export to China.</p><p>While prison labor seeps into the supply chains of some companies through third-party suppliers without them knowing, others buy direct. Mammoth commodity traders that are essential to feeding the globe like Cargill, Bunge, Louis Dreyfus, Archer Daniels Midland and Consolidated Grain and Barge – which together post annual revenues of more than $400 billion – have in recent years scooped up millions of dollars’ worth of soy, corn and wheat straight from prisons, which compete with local farmers.</p><p>The AP reached out for comment to the companies it identified as having connections to prison labor, but most did not respond.</p><p>Cargill acknowledged buying goods from prison farms in Tennessee, Arkansas and Ohio, saying they constituted only a small fraction of the company’s overall volume. It added that “we are now in the process of determining the appropriate remedial action.” </p><h2>The AP tied prison labor to the supply chains of some of the world’s biggest companies</h2>
    
<p>McDonald’s said it would investigate links to any such labor, while Archer Daniels Midland and General Mills, which produces Gold Medal flour, pointed to their policies in place restricting suppliers from using forced labor. Whole Foods responded flatly: “Whole Foods Market does not allow the use of prison labor in products sold at our stores.” </p><p>Bunge said it sold all facilities that were sourcing from correction departments in 2021, so they are “no longer part of Bunge’s footprint.”</p><p>Dairy Farmers of America, a cooperative that bills itself as the top supplier of raw milk worldwide, said that while it has been buying from correctional facilities, it now only has one “member dairy” at a prison, with most of that milk used inside. </p><p>To understand the business of prison labor and the complex movement of agricultural goods, the AP collected information from all 50 states, through public records requests and inquiries to corrections departments. Reporters also crisscrossed the country, following trucks transporting crops and livestock linked to prison work, and tailed transport vans from prisons and work-release sites heading to places such as poultry plants, egg farms and fast-food restaurants. A lack of transparency and, at times, baffling losses exposed in audits, added to the challenges of fully tracking the money.</p><p>Big-ticket items like row crops and livestock are sold on the open market, with profits fed back into agriculture programs. For instance, about a dozen state prison farms, including operations in Texas, Virginia, Kentucky and Montana, have sold more than $60 million worth of cattle since 2018.</p><p>As with other sales, the custody of cows can take a serpentine route. Because they often are sold online at auction houses or to stockyards, it can be almost impossible to determine where the beef eventually ends up. </p><p>Sometimes there’s only one way to know for sure. </p>
    
<p>In Louisiana, an AP reporter watched as three long trailers loaded with more than 80 cattle left the state penitentiary. The cows raised by prisoners traveled for about an hour before being unloaded for sale at Dominique’s Livestock Market in Baton Rouge. </p><p>As they were shoved through a gate into a viewing pen, the auctioneer jokingly warned buyers “Watch out!” The cows, he said, had just broken out of prison. </p><p>Within minutes, the Angola lot was snapped up by a local livestock dealer, who then sold the cattle to a Texas beef processor that also buys cows directly from prisons in that state. Meat from the slaughterhouse winds up in the supply chains of some of the country’s biggest fast-food chains, supermarkets and meat exporters, including Burger King, Sam’s Club and Tyson Foods.</p><p>“It’s a real slap in the face, to hear where all those cattle are going,” said Jermaine Hudson, who served 22 years at Angola on a robbery conviction before he was exonerated.</p><p>He said it’s especially galling because the food served in prison tasted like slop. </p><p>“Those were some of the most disrespectful meals,” Hudson said, “that I ever, in my life, had to endure.” </p><div data-edge-to-edge="">

                </div><h2>THE RISE OF PRISON LABOR</h2><p>Angola is imposing in its sheer scale. The so-called “Alcatraz of the South” is tucked far away, surrounded by alligator-infested swamps in a bend of the Mississippi River. It spans 18,000 acres – an area bigger than the island of Manhattan – and has its own ZIP code.</p><p>The former 19th-century antebellum plantation once was owned by one of the largest slave traders in the U.S. Today, it houses some 3,800 men behind its razor-wire walls, about 65 percent of them Black. Within days of arrival, they typically head to the fields, sometimes using hoes and shovels or picking crops by hand. They initially work for free, but then can earn between 2 cents and 40 cents an hour.</p><p>Calvin Thomas, who spent more than 17 years at Angola, said anyone who refused to work, didn’t produce enough or just stepped outside the long straight rows knew there would be consequences. </p><p>“If he shoots the gun in the air because you done passed that line, that means you’re going to get locked up and you’re going to have to pay for that bullet that he shot,” said Thomas, adding that some days were so blistering hot the guards’ horses would collapse.</p><div data-align-center="">

<p>Louisiana corrections spokesman Ken Pastorick called that description “absurd.” He said the phrase “sentenced with hard labor” is a legal term referring to a prisoner with a felony conviction. </p><p>Pastorick said the department has transformed Angola from “the bloodiest prison in America” over the past several decades with “large-scale criminal justice reforms and reinvestment into the creation of rehabilitation, vocational and educational programs designed to help individuals better themselves and successfully return to communities.” He noted that pay rates are set by state statute.</p><p>Current and former prisoners in both <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/louisiana-angola-prison-lawsuit-a091bf3375d091994d5814539dafb87f" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Louisiana</a></span> and <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/alabama-inmate-labor-lawsuit-a4f8d5c94fb5b5f197db680e613f0198" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alabama</a></span> have filed class-action lawsuits in the past four months saying they have been forced to provide cheap – or free – labor to those states and outside companies, a practice they also described as slavery. </p><p>Prisoners have been made to work since before emancipation, when slaves were at times imprisoned and then leased out by local authorities.</p><p>But after the Civil War, the 13th Amendment’s exception clause that allows for prison labor provided legal cover to round up thousands of mostly young Black men. Many were jailed for petty offenses like loitering and vagrancy. They then were leased out by states to plantations like Angola and some of the country’s biggest companies, including coal mines and railroads. They were routinely whipped for not meeting quotas while doing brutal and often deadly work.</p><h2>Photo Gallery: Prison labor over the years</h2><div data-align-center="" data-carousel-enhancement="">

A law passed a few years later made it illegal to knowingly transport or sell goods made by incarcerated workers across state lines, though an exception was made for agricultural products. Today, after years of efforts by lawmakers and businesses, corporations are setting up joint ventures with corrections agencies, enabling them to sell almost anything nationwide. </p><h2>To learn more about the history of prison labor, listen to this Reveal podcast as AP reporters take you back more than 150 years to explore how a brutal system known as convict leasing helped build American business empires.</h2>
    
<p>Civilian workers are guaranteed basic rights and protections by OSHA and laws like the Fair Labor Standards Act, but prisoners, who are often not legally considered employees, are denied many of those entitlements and cannot protest or form unions. </p><p>“They may be doing the exact same work as people who are not incarcerated, but they don’t have the training, they don’t have the experience, they don’t have the protective equipment,” said Jennifer Turner, lead author of a 2022 American Civil Liberties Union <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.aclu.org/report/captive-labor-exploitation-incarcerated-workers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a></span> on prison labor.</p><p>Almost all of the country’s state and federal adult prisons have some sort of work program, employing around 800,000 people, the report said. It noted the vast majority of those jobs are connected to tasks like maintaining prisons, laundry or kitchen work, which typically pay a few cents an hour if anything at all. And the few who land the highest-paying state industry jobs may earn only a dollar an hour.</p><p>Altogether, labor tied specifically to goods and services produced through state prison industries brought in more than $2 billion in 2021, the ACLU report said. That includes everything from making mattresses to solar panels, but does not account for work-release and other programs run through local jails, detention and immigration centers and even drug and alcohol rehabilitation facilities.</p><p>Some incarcerated workers with just a few months or years left on their sentences have been employed everywhere from popular restaurant chains like Burger King to major retail stores and meat-processing plants. Unlike work crews picking up litter in orange jumpsuits, they go largely unnoticed, often wearing the same uniforms as their civilian counterparts. </p><div data-align-fullwidth="">

            </div><p>Outside jobs can be coveted because they typically pay more and some states deposit a small percentage earned into a savings account for prisoners’ eventual release. Though many companies pay minimum wage, some states garnish more than half their salaries for items such as room and board and court fees. </p><p>It’s a different story for those on prison farms. The biggest operations remain in the South and crops are still harvested on a number of former slave plantations, including in Arkansas, Texas and at Mississippi’s notorious Parchman Farm. Those states, along with Florida, Alabama, South Carolina and Georgia, pay nothing for most types of work. </p><p>Most big farms, including Angola, have largely mechanized many of their operations, using commercial-size tractors, trucks and combines for corn, soy, rice and other row crops. But prisoners in some places continue to do other work by hand, including clearing brush with swing blades. </p><p>“I was in a field with a hoe in my hand with maybe like a hundred other women. We were standing in a line very closely together, and we had to raise our hoes up at the exact same time and count ‘One, two, three, chop!’” said Faye Jacobs, who worked on prison farms in Arkansas. </p><p>Jacobs, who was released in 2018 after more than 26 years, said the only pay she received was two rolls of toilet paper a week, toothpaste and a few menstrual pads each month. </p><div data-align-center="">

                </div><p>She recounted being made to carry rocks from one end of a field to the other and back again for hours, and said she also endured taunting from guards saying “Come on, hos, it’s hoe squad!” She said she later was sent back to the fields at another prison after women there complained of sexual harassment by staff inside the facility. </p><p>“We were like ‘Is this a punishment?’” she said. “‘We’re telling y’all that we’re being sexually harassed, and you come back and the first thing you want to do is just put us all on hoe squad.’”</p><p>David Farabough, who oversees the state’s 20,000 acres of prison farms, said Arkansas’ operations can help build character. </p><p>“A lot of these guys come from homes where they’ve never understood work and they’ve never understood the feeling at the end of the day for a job well-done,” he said. “We’re giving them purpose. … And then at the end of the day, they get the return by having better food in the kitchens.”</p>
    
<p>In addition to giant farms, at least 650 correctional facilities nationwide have prisoners doing jobs like landscaping, tending greenhouses and gardens, raising livestock, beekeeping and even fish farming, said Joshua Sbicca, director of the Prison Agriculture Lab at Colorado State University. He noted that corrections officials exert power by deciding who deserves trade-building jobs like welding, for example, and who works in the fields.</p><p>In several states, along with raising chickens, cows and hogs, corrections departments have their own processing plants, dairies and canneries. But many states also hire out prisoners to do that same work at big private companies. </p><p>The AP met women in Mississippi locked up at restitution centers, the equivalent of debtors’ prisons, to pay off court-mandated expenses. They worked at Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen and other fast-food chains and also have been hired out to individuals for work like lawn mowing or home repairs.</p><p>“There is nothing innovative or interesting about this system of forced labor as punishment for what in so many instances is an issue of poverty or substance abuse,” said Cliff Johnson, director of the MacArthur Justice Center at the University of Mississippi. </p><p>In Alabama, where prisoners are leased out by companies, AP reporters followed inmate transport vans to poultry plants run by Tyson Foods, which owns brands such as Hillshire Farms, Jimmy Dean and Sara Lee, along with a company that supplies beef, chicken and fish to McDonald’s. The vans also stopped at a chicken processor that’s part of a joint-venture with Cargill, which is America’s largest private company. It brought in a record $177 billion in revenue in fiscal year 2023 and supplies conglomerates like PepsiCo. </p><p>Though Tyson did not respond to questions about direct links to prison farms, it said that its work-release programs are voluntary and that incarcerated workers receive the same pay as their civilian colleagues.</p><p>Some people arrested in Alabama are put to work even before they’ve been convicted. An unusual work-release program accepts pre-trial defendants, allowing them to avoid jail while earning bond money. But with multiple fees deducted from their salaries, that can take time. </p><div data-align-fullwidth="">

                </div><p>In March 2020, though all other outside company jobs were halted, the Arizona corrections department announced about 140 women were being abruptly moved from their prison to a metal hangar-like warehouse on property owned by Hickman’s Family Farms, which pitches itself as the Southwest’s largest egg producer. </p><p>Hickman’s has employed prisoners for nearly 30 years and supplies many grocery stores, including Costco and Kroger, marketing brands such as Eggland’s Best and Land O’ Lakes. It is the state corrections department’s largest labor contractor, bringing in nearly $35 million in revenue over the past six fiscal years. </p><p>“The only reason they had us out there was because they didn’t want to lose that contract because the prison makes so much money off of it,” said Brooke Counts, who lived at Hickman’s desert site, which operated for 14 months. She was serving a drug-related sentence and said she feared losing privileges or being transferred to a more secure prison yard if she refused to work.</p><p>Counts said she knew prisoners who were seriously hurt, including one woman who was impaled in the groin and required a helicopter flight to the hospital and another who lost part of a finger. </p><p>Hickman’s, which has faced a number of lawsuits stemming from inmate injuries, did not respond to emailed questions or phone messages seeking a response. Corrections department officials would not comment on why the women were moved off-site, saying it happened during a previous administration. But a statement at the time said the move was made to “ensure a stable food supply while also protecting public health and the health of those in our custody.” </p><p>Some women employed by Hickman’s earned less than $3 an hour after deductions, including 30 percent taken by the state for room and board, even though they were living in the makeshift dormitory. </p><p>“While we were out there, we were still paying the prison rent,” Counts said. “What for?” </p><div data-align-fullwidth="" data-video-orientation="landscape">

        </div><h2>FOLLOWING THE MONEY</h2><p>The business of prison labor is so vast and convoluted that tracing the money can be challenging. Some agricultural programs regularly go into the red, raising questions in state audits and prompting investigations into potential corruption, mismanagement or general inefficiency.</p><p>Nearly half the agricultural goods produced in Texas between 2014 and 2018 lost money, for example, and a similar report in Louisiana uncovered losses of around $3.8 million between fiscal years 2016 and 2018. A separate federal investigation into graft at the for-profit arm of Louisiana’s correctional department led to the jailing of two employees.</p><p>Correctional officials say steep farming expenditures and unpredictable variables like weather can eat into profits. And while some goods may do poorly, they note, others do well.</p><p>Prisons at times have generated revenue by tapping into niche markets or to their states’ signature foods. </p><p>During the six-year period the AP examined, surplus raw milk from a Wisconsin prison dairy went to BelGioioso Cheese, which makes Polly-O string cheese and other products that land in grocery stores nationwide like Whole Foods. A California prison provided almonds to Minturn Nut Company, a major producer and exporter. And until 2022, Colorado was raising water buffalo for milk that was sold to giant mozzarella cheesemaker Leprino Foods, which supplies major pizza companies like Domino’s, Pizza Hut and Papa John’s.</p><p>But for many states, it’s the work-release programs that have become the biggest cash generators, largely because of the low overhead. In Alabama, for instance, the state brought in more than $32 million in the past five fiscal years after garnishing 40 percent of prisoners’ wages.</p>

</div>
<p>In some states, work-release programs are run on the local level, with sheriffs frequently responsible for handling the books and awarding contracts. Even though the programs are widely praised – by the state, employers and often prisoners themselves – reports of abuse exist. </p><p>In Louisiana, where more than 1,200 companies hire prisoners through work release, sheriffs get anywhere from about $10 to $20 a day for each state prisoner they house in local jails to help ease overcrowding. And they can deduct more than half of the wages earned by those contracted out to companies – a huge revenue stream for small counties. </p><p>Jack Strain, a former longtime sheriff in the state’s St. Tammany Parish, pleaded guilty in 2021 in a scheme involving the privatization of a work-release program in which nearly $1.4 million was taken in and steered to Strain, close associates and family members. <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/louisiana-crime-955396468ac0ef2cb957667c051069a8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">He was sentenced to 10 years in prison</a></span>, which came on top of four consecutive life sentences for a broader sex scandal linked to that same program. </p><p>Incarcerated people also have been contracted to companies that partner with prisons. In Idaho, they’ve sorted and packed the state’s famous potatoes, which are exported and sold to companies nationwide. In Kansas, they’ve been employed at Russell Stover chocolates and Cal-Maine Foods, the country’s largest egg producer. Though the company has since stopped using them, in recent years they were hired in Arizona by Taylor Farms, which sells salad kits in many major grocery stores nationwide and supplies popular fast-food chains and restaurants like Chipotle Mexican Grill.</p><p>Some states would not provide the names of companies taking part in transitional prison work programs, citing security concerns. So AP reporters confirmed some prisoners’ private employers with officials running operations on the ground and also followed inmate transport vehicles as they zigzagged through cities and drove down country roads. The vans stopped everywhere from giant meat-processing plants to a chicken and daiquiri restaurant. </p><div data-align-fullwidth="">

   <p>Iain Campbell was gazing out the bus window on his way to work when he first sensed something radical was reshaping how he experienced the world. </p>   <p>The inkling emerged from an altogether ordinary observation: He felt peaceful, maybe even happy as he watched the trees along the road pass by. </p>   <p>"I hadn't experienced that in a really long time, probably since I was a kid," says Campbell, who lives in Edinburgh, Scotland. </p>   <p><strong>"</strong>I didn't know what was going on at the time, but I thought this might be what it feels like to be normal." </p>   
   <p>Campbell had lived with bipolar disorder for much of his life. Mental illness runs in his family, and he'd lost loved ones to suicide. Over the years, he tried different treatments, but it had become "increasingly difficult to live with."</p>   <p>What had changed? A few weeks earlier, he'd started a new diet. </p>   <p>Campbell dealt with unwanted weight gain and metabolic troubles, a common side effect of psychiatric medications. </p>   <p>In an effort to lose weight, he drastically cut back on carbs and instead focused on protein and fat. It turns out he'd unknowingly entered ketosis: A metabolic state where the body switches from glucose as its primary energy source to ketones, which come from fat. </p>   <p>He started learning about the <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1528-1167.2008.01821.x">ketogenic diet</a>, which is high fat and very low carb, on podcasts and YouTube videos. Soon, he was tracking his ketone levels, courtesy of an at-home blood test. </p>   <p>"I realized it was actually the ketone level that was making this shift in my symptoms in a way that nothing else ever had," he says. "It struck me as really significant, like life-changing." </p>   <h3>A career-launching moment</h3>   <p>How exactly was a diet performing this alchemy? Campbell decided to pursue a Ph.D. in mental health at the University of Edinburgh, hoping to do his own research and learn whether it could help others.  </p>   
   <p>In online forums, people with bipolar disorder were <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/bjpsych-open/article/ketosis-and-bipolar-disorder-controlled-analytic-study-of-online-reports/24F5057C04622AB3306F638F3FFB7D65">sharing similar anecdotes</a> — they were finding improvements in their mood, increased clarity and fewer episodes of depression. </p>   <p>But as Campbell searched for ways to launch a proper clinical trial to test the  diet's effectiveness, he became discouraged. </p>   <p>"It was really like you were considered wacky," he says. "At one point, I thought nobody's going to pay for this research." </p>   <p>He put together a 45-minute <a href="https://twitter.com/IainCampbellPhD/status/1359678469727207425">video</a> summing up the biological rationale for using the ketogenic diet in bipolar disorder and posted it on social media, not expecting much after that. </p>   <div id="res1227320413">

                The ketogenic diet avoids most carbs and instead focuses on high-fat foods, proteins and vegetables.

   <p>But some doctors had already started researching it after seeing the potential in their practice, among them <a href="https://www.chrispalmermd.com/">Chris Palmer</a>, a psychiatrist at Harvard Medical School and McLean Hospital. </p>   <p>Palmer had his own revelation about the diet a few years earlier, which he detailed in a 2017 <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0920996417300634?via%3Dihub">case report</a>. Two patients with schizo-affective disorder had "truly dramatic, life-changing improvement in their psychotic symptoms," he says. </p>   <p>In early 2021, he started working with the eldest son of Jan and David Baszucki, a wealthy tech entrepreneur. Their son Matt had bipolar disorder and had been on many medications in recent years. </p>   <p>Jan Baszucki enlisted Palmer's help as her son gave the ketogenic diet a try. </p>   <p>"Within a couple of months, we saw a dramatic change," she says.</p>   <p>Inspired, she started contacting clinicians and researchers, looking to bring more visibility — and funding — to the treatment. Since rigorous data on the diet is still lacking, she wants to see researchers conduct large clinical trials to back up anecdotes like her son's recovery. </p>   <p>Soon a big-time philanthropist was in touch with Campbell, ready to pay for his bipolar study — and others.</p>   <p>Now, around a <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/search?cond=Psychiatric%20Disorder&amp;intr=ketogenic%20diet">dozen clinical trials</a> are in the works, testing the diet's effect on mental illness, most notably for bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and depression, but also for conditions like anorexia, alcoholism and PTSD.  </p>   
   <p>"The research and the clinical interest is suddenly exploding," says Dr. <a href="https://www.diagnosisdiet.com/about">Georgia Ede</a>, a psychiatrist in Massachusetts, who began using the ketogenic diet in her own practice about a decade ago. </p>   <h3>From epilepsy care to the mainstream</h3>   <p>The classic <a href="https://www.epilepsy.com/treatment/dietary-therapies/ketogenic-diet#:~:text=The%20%22classic%22%20ketogenic%20diet%20is,do%20not%20respond%20to%20medications.">ketogenic diet</a> contains an eye-popping amount of fat, roughly 90% of calories coming from that alone. Other <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8322232/">versions</a> have come along that dial down the fat and allow more room for protein and slightly more carbohydrates. </p>   <div id="res1227340993">

   <p>Serious followers may buy a device to measure ketone levels in their blood, to track whether they've entered a range that means they're experiencing what's called nutritional ketosis. </p>   <p>The diet's entrance into the mainstream has fed plenty of debate about its merits, with some medical groups <a href="https://www.heart.org/en/news/2023/04/27/heres-how-10-popular-diets-scored-for-heart-health">raising concerns</a>. Yet, there's also growing attention — and <a href="https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/search?intr=ketogenic%20&amp;page=3">clinical trials</a> underway — on its potential, not only for obesity but a variety of other conditions. </p>   <p>"It's not a fad diet," says Dr. <a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/shebani-sethi">Shebani Sethi</a>, who's leading <a href="https://metabolicpsychiatry.com/">research </a>into the diet's potential for mental health at Stanford University. "It's a medical intervention."</p>   <p>The ketogenic diet was developed over a hundred years ago for pediatric epilepsy and has seen a resurgence in that field over the last three decades.</p>   <p>"It's a general standard of care for epilepsy," says <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/profiles/details/eric-kossoff">Dr. Eric Kossoff</a>, a pediatric neurologist at Johns Hopkins University. </p>   <p>This <a href="https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD001903.pub5/full">track record </a>in epilepsy, the thinking goes, paves the way for its adoption in psychiatry. There <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9122168/#:~:text=Psychiatric%20disorders%20occur%20very%20often,the%20course%20of%20the%20disorder.">are links</a> between the conditions. Medications developed for seizures are <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/the-british-journal-of-psychiatry/article/abs/antiseizure-medications-prescribing-for-behavioural-and-psychiatric-concerns-in-adults-with-an-intellectual-disability-living-in-england/87E58ED04FC99F9C7E5DAA519EC4E639">regularly prescribed</a> for a range of psychiatric conditions such as bipolar disorder. </p>   <p><strong>"</strong>We use them off label, even when we don't have studies to suggest or prove that they are helpful for people with mental illness," says Palmer. "So, in many ways, this is nothing new." </p>   <h3>The metabolic link </h3>   <p>There's also a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6016046/#:~:text=Convincing%20evidence%20shows%20that%20psychiatric,obesity%2C%20hypertension%2C%20and%20hyperglycemia.">well-documented</a> association between a variety of psychiatric conditions and metabolic problems like high blood sugar and <a href="https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2021/09/insulin-resistance-major-depressive-disorder.html">insulin resistance</a>, <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2806720">Type 2 diabetes</a>, obesity and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3996437/">hypertension</a>. </p>   
   <p>People with psychiatric disorders are at an increased risk. And it's not just that psychiatric meds can cause weight gain and other issuses. Research shows these problems <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6352957/">can arise</a> even before someone with serious mental illness takes medication or is diagnosed. </p>   <p>"We've known for a long time that there's something going on in the metabolism of the brain that's not quite right in people with severe mental illness," says <a href="https://www.mcleanhospital.org/profile/dost-ongur">Dr. Dost Öngür</a>, chief of the division of Psychotic Disorders at McLean Hospital and a professor at Harvard Medical School. </p>   <p>This evidence of energy problems in the brain and elsewhere in the body has accumulated over the decades in psychiatry — unrelated to the ketogenic diet. </p>   <p>"We can't say that there's a causal relationship, but there are a lot of connections that should be explored further," says Öngür, whose <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37812338/">work</a> has focused on <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29523870/">this theme</a> in bipolar and schizophrenia. </p>   <p>All of this data is strong enough to suspect that "metabolic problems may be more than just innocent bystanders," that they may, in fact, play a direct role in the development, severity or course of psychiatric conditions," says Ede.</p>   <div id="res1227323607">

   <h3>The theory behind keto's power</h3>   <p>So, how exactly could a diet that stops seizures also exert powerful effects on tough-to-treat psychiatric illness? </p>   <p>Even after decades, scientists who study epilepsy aren't exactly sure why it works for that illness.</p>   <p>"It's impacting so many different mechanisms," says <a href="https://health.usf.edu/medicine/mpp/faculty/ddagosti">Dominic D'Agostino</a>, a professor of molecular pharmacology and physiology at the University of South Florida who studies the ketogenic diet. </p>   <p>That's why he likes to characterize the diet as being more like a "shotgun" than a "bullet." </p>   <p>During ketosis, the body essentially changes metabolic gears. It increasingly draws on ketones — made from the breakdown of fat in the liver – instead of glucose. </p>   <p>"We know this happens on a ketogenic diet," says Kossoff. "Ketones can be used for energy, but how that helps seizures is the next tricky question."</p>   
   <p>Because the diet eliminates carbohydrates, blood sugar comes down and insulin sensitivity <a href="https://diabetesjournals.org/spectrum/article/33/2/133/32999/Low-Carbohydrate-and-Very-Low-Carbohydrate-Diets">improves</a>.</p>   <p>"You take pressure off of your really delicate insulin signaling system," says Ede, while offering cells another fuel that could bring parts of the "brain back online that may have been stuttering."</p>   <p>Palmer and other scientists believe problems with mitochondria — the powerhouses of the cells that produce energy — are central to mental illness. </p>   <p>"This is likely due to mitochondria's essential role in maintaining key brain function," says <a href="https://pharmtox.utoronto.ca/faculty/ana-andreazza">Ana Andreazza</a>, a professor of pharmacology and psychiatry at the University of Toronto. </p>   <p>In her lab, Andreazza studies what biological pathways make people with psychiatric illness more vulnerable to mitochondrial dysfunction. </p>   <p>Cumulative damage to these vital powerhouses ultimately leads to a "metabolic shift" that wreaks havoc in myriad ways — what's apparent in their increased production of lactate.  </p>   <p>"The findings are compelling for many psychiatric disorders," she says. </p>   <p>It's possible the ketones help the mitochondria by relieving oxidative stress — a harmful buildup of free radicals, she says, and by providing an energy source that circumvents the dysfunctional machinery in the mitochondria.</p>   <p>"Once you trend towards more normal mitochondrial function and metabolic health, that's restoring neurotransmitter systems, it's even restoring blood flow to the brain," says D'Agostino.</p>   <div id="res1227321652">

   <h3>Scientists search for more clues  </h3>   <p>The effect of ketosis on the mitochondria is one hypothesis for why keto diets could work, but it may not be the whole story.</p>   <p>Much of the data on how the diet <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8650112/">affects the brain</a> comes from research into epilepsy and other neurological diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. </p>   <p>Scientists find serious mental illnesses like schizophrenia, major depression and bipolar disorder share notable similarities with these conditions: Inflammation in the brain, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and issues with glucose and insulin. </p>   <p>Research suggests ketosis can be <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00702-023-02620-x">beneficial</a> on these fronts, although human studies are limited. Some of the larger clinical trials now underway for keto diets will seek to pin down what's going on. </p>   
   <p>For example, Dr. <a href="https://www.medschool.umaryland.edu/profiles/kelly-deanna/">Deanna Kelly</a> is trying to determine if the diet's potential benefits emerge from <a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/news/keto-diet-protects-against-epileptic-seizures-scientists-are">the microbiome</a> in the gut. </p>   <p>"You're potentially changing the way bacteria are functioning and that could affect your behavior and your brain," says Kelly, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, who's leading an inpatient trial on the ketogenic diet for schizophrenia.</p>   <p>Other scientists are studying the diet's effect on neurotransmitters like GABA — which acts as a kind of brake in the brain. </p>   <p>Dr. Mary Phillips, who has studied how dopamine affects the reward circuit in bipolar disorder, thinks that may help explain its therapeutic effects. </p>   <p>She hopes her <a href="https://www.psychiatry.pitt.edu/pitt-psychiatry-awarded-6m-baszucki-brain-research-fund-grant-study-therapeutic-effect-ketogenic">clinical trial of bipolar</a> and the keto diet, which launched recently, also gets at a very practical question: </p>   <p>"How do you know which people the ketogenic diet is going to work for?" says <a href="https://www.psychiatry.pitt.edu/about-us/our-people/faculty/mary-l-phillips-md">Phillips</a>, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh. "It's not the easiest diet in the world to get started on." </p>   <h3>Early evidence shows promise </h3>   <p>Much of the <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37066662/">current evidence</a> on its potential for mental health comes from case reports, observational data and open trials that have laid the groundwork for more rigorous studies. </p>   <p>The research that exists shows improvements in both mental and metabolic health. </p>   <p>Iain Campbell's <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/bjpsych-open/article/pilot-study-of-a-ketogenic-diet-in-bipolar-disorder/3C44C39ACE747A042179D2876D1AB143">small pilot study</a>, designed to test the feasibility of a randomized controlled trial, found patients lost an average of about 10 pounds and had "significant reductions" in blood pressure. </p>   <p>"As the ketone level went up, we saw their mood improved, their energy improved, their anxiety decreased and their impulsivity decreased," says Campbell, who's now a Baszucki research fellow in metabolic psychiatry at the University of Edinburgh.  </p>   <p>Their blood lactate levels, a sign of mitochondrial dysfunction, dropped as did <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.10.23.23297391v1.full.pdf">glutamate in the brain</a>, an effect also seen with anti-seizure medications. </p>   
   <p>A recent study from Toulouse, France, is <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.951376/full">the largest</a> to look at hospitalized patients with severe mental illness.</p>   <p>Though three patients couldn't stick with it, the 28 who did had substantial improvements in their symptoms of depression and psychosis by the third week, says Ede, a co-author of the study. </p>   <p>Ultimately, 43% achieved clinical remission.</p>   <p>There was no control group, but she points out these patients had been hospitalized before under the care of the same psychiatrist — with the only clear difference in treatment this time being the ketogenic diet. </p>   <p><em>"</em>So we believe the diet probably had something to do with the outcome," says Ede.</p>   <p>At Stanford, Sethi's pilot <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a2nBYcSN-8">study </a>found the majority of patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder had "clinically meaningful improvement" on the diet and close to half "achieved recovery." </p>   <p>A quarter of those who entered the study had metabolic syndrome — a cluster of risk factors like insulin resistance and high blood pressure — and by the end, had reversed the condition. </p>   <p>Dr. <a href="https://doctors.stonybrookmedicine.edu/provider/Anissa+Abi-Dargham/2358960">Anissa Abi-Dargham</a>, who isn't involved in the research, calls the initial data "intriguing," when considered alongside the existing evidence on epilepsy, and metabolic dysfunction in psychiatric illness. </p>   <p><strong>"</strong>All this together convinces me there is a signal that is worth pursuing in a rigorous way," says Abi-Dargham, chair of the department of psychiatry and behavioral health at Stony Brook University. </p>   <p>But the rush of attention ahead of solid clinical data has raised eyebrows among some psychiatrists. </p>   <p>Dr. <a href="https://drewramseymd.com/">Drew Ramsey</a> worries the hype has created an unrealistic perception about the ketogenic diet in mental health. For now, he remains skeptical. </p>   <p>"Does it work? It works for some people, which is awesome, but most things work for some people in mental health," says Ramsey, a nutritional psychiatrist.  </p>   <p>Proponents readily acknowledge the field is still in the early stages.</p>   <p>"You have to be modest about this," says Öngür. "The ketogenic diet is really a test case, but it's not the silver bullet.<em>"</em></p>   
   <p>Palmer says the diet is a powerful intervention, but "it's not going to cure everybody with mental illness, or even necessarily help everybody." </p>   <h3>Metabolic psychiatry takes off </h3>   <p>The groundswell of excitement around a high-fat, minimal carb diet reflects a broader movement to better recognize the link between metabolic health and mental illness. </p>   <p>Ketogenic diet research is just one branch of a growing area of research now being called <a href="https://metabolicpsychiatry.com/">metabolic psychiatry</a>.</p>   <div id="res1227324431">

   <p>Sethi, who coined the term when she launched Stanford's program in 2015, says the idea is to study how treating metabolic health — tackling conditions like high blood sugar, insulin resistance and obesity — may also improve psychiatric problems. </p>   <p>While keto is the most prominent example, she says medications are also <a href="https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2015/11/insulin-sensitizing-drug-relieves-symptoms-of-chronic-depression.html">under study</a>, including drugs that make the body more sensitive to insulin — the hormone that helps usher glucose into cells. </p>   <p>This approach is intuitive for Sethi, who trained in obesity medicine and psychiatry. It was in medical school that she first witnessed keto's potential for her psychiatric patients.</p>   <p>A woman with treatment-resistant schizophrenia had tried the diet to lose weight and manage her diabetes. To her surprise at the time, Sethi recalls it also helped the patient with hallucinations. </p>   <p>A <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35120288/">recent clinical trial</a> underscores the promise of targeting metabolic problems, beyond just the ketogenic diet.</p>   <p>Patients with treatment-resistant bipolar depression and insulin resistance, but not Type 2 diabetes, were prescribed the diabetes drug metformin. </p>   <p>By the end of the study, half of those who took the medication had reversed their insulin resistance — and also found dramatic improvements in their psychiatric symptoms, even though most had been ill for 25 years without any remission. </p>   <p>"I was kind of blown away," says <a href="https://medicine.dal.ca/departments/department-sites/psychiatry/our-people/faculty/cynthia-calkin.html">Dr. Cynthia Calkin</a>, a psychiatrist at Dalhousie University in Canada who led the study. "It's not that metformin is an antidepressant, it's that it can reverse insulin resistance, and that improves outcomes."</p>   
   <h3>"A tailwind" to wellness</h3>   <p>Neither patients nor clinicians are waiting for the results of larger trials to try keto. </p>   <p>Online, patients <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/10k9eim/those_of_you_doing_keto_for_mental_health_reasons/">share their experiences</a> with — and challenges — trying the diet. And doctors like Sethi and Ede, who trains other clinicians, regularly treat patients with it. </p>   <div id="res1227325279">

   </div>
   <p>About four years ago, Lori Katz ended up at Sethi's Stanford clinic after trying many treatments for bipolar disorder — a diagnosis she received when she was 18 years old. </p>   <p>She also struggled with chronic pain, binge eating and emotional eating, and unwanted weight gain. Her episodes of depression had led her to consider electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). </p>   <p>The ketogenic diet was quite the adjustment, but Katz gave it a go, under Sethi's supervision. </p>   <p>"Suddenly, I was losing weight really fast and was extremely satisfied with what I was eating," says Katz, a dog trainer who lives in Santa Cruz, Calif. </p>   <p>She says those around her quickly noticed a change in her mood.</p>   <p>"It wasn't just the depressive symptoms, but it was the feeling of lack of control," she says. The keto diet, she says, "was like a tailwind — just blowing me into a better future."</p>   <p>Eventually, she started going to the gym and taking longer walks. And after years without a romantic drive, a girlfriend entered her life. </p>   <p>Katz says she can't always follow the diet perfectly and notices the change in mood when she is less strict. It hasn't erased the reality of living with a mental illness. </p>   <p>"I will live with this but it's a question of am I more resilient? Yes. Am I more optimistic? Yes. Am I feeling like I have this tool? Yes, when I get in there and I get the support. I need to stay in ketosis." </p>   <h3>Can it be done? </h3>   <p>Indeed, any kind of diet can be <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9316956/">hard to stick to,</a> and one that involves largely giving up common comfort foods like bread and sweets may be even more challenging. </p>   
   <p>About a quarter of those in Campbell's study withdrew, which he notes is <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/bjpsych-open/article/pilot-study-of-a-ketogenic-diet-in-bipolar-disorder/3C44C39ACE747A042179D2876D1AB143">similar to other pilot trials</a> with the ketogenic diet. </p>   <p>Dr. <a href="https://louisville.edu/medicine/departments/psychiatry/faculty/faculty-1/el-mallakh">Rif El-Mallakh</a>, a psychiatrist at the University of Louisville, became interested in the diet more than two decades ago and believes it works. </p>   <p>He says he had early <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23030231/">success with a few patients</a>, but hasn't had much luck over the years: "I haven't been able to get people to stay on it, so I'm not at all as excited as maybe others."</p>   <p>However, doctors who already use it in their practice say with enough education and support patients can be successful.</p>   <p>Dr. Matt Bernstein has found striking results in some of his patients. </p>   <p>Some opt for the most restrictive form of the diet, especially if they have severe symptoms, but he emphasizes it can be tailored and even a "modest version" has made an "incredible difference" for some patients. </p>   <p>He'll ease them into it, lowering their carbohydrate intake gradually. </p>   <p>"Some people like to do it cold turkey, but for a lot of people, that's not the best thing," says <a href="https://www.ellenhorn.com/our-team/">Bernstein,</a> chief medical officer at Ellenhorn, a psychiatric recovery program in Boston. </p>   <p>"The idea is that this is going to be sustainable and not just something you do for a few months and then stop." </p>   <p>Not many psychiatrists are trained to offer the diet, although the numbers are growing. </p>   <p>Bernstein and other doctors say those with a history of serious mental illness should have medical supervision. There can be lab work and medications that need to be adjusted. </p>   <p>Despite the optimism, there are still many unanswered questions. </p>   <p>In his initial research, Iain Campbell's already hearing some real results of his dream to help others find this treatment.</p>   <p>"They would describe it to me like, 'This changed my life completely. I'm reconnecting with my family. I can work again for the first time,'" he says. </p>   <p><em>Editing and visual design by Carmel Wroth. Visual producing by Katie Hayes Luke.</em></p>

            <p><i>They tell you that injustice is part of some grand plan. And that’s what keeps you from rising against it.&nbsp;</i></p>
<p><i>—Shehan Karunatilaka,</i> The Seven Moons of Maali Almeida </p>
<p>Patient R was in a hurry. I signed into my computer—or tried to. Recently, IT had us update to a new 14-digit password. Once in, I signed (different password) into the electronic medical record. I had already ordered routine lab tests, but R had new info. I pulled up a menu to add on an additional HIV viral load to capture early infection, which the standard antibody test might miss. R went to the lab to get his blood drawn</p>
<p>My last order did not print to the onsite laboratory. An observant nurse had seen the order and no tube. The patient had left without the viral load being drawn. I called the patient: could he come back?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Healthcare workers do not like the electronic health record (EHR), where they spend more time than with patients. <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/11/12/why-doctors-hate-their-computers"><u>Doctors hate it</u></a>, as do <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30220361/"><u>nurse practitioners</u></a>, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26340247/"><u>nurses</u></a>, <a href="https://www.pharmacypracticenews.com/Pharmacy-Technology-Report/Article/09-23/GROSS-Gives-Input-on-Troublesome-Tech-Issues/71315"><u>pharmacists</u></a>, and <a href="https://rehabpub.com/clinic-management/software/emr-fatigue-3-ways-the-wrong-system-contributes-to-pt-burnout/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThe%20finding%20that%20the%20odds,burnout%2C%E2%80%9D%20Mayo%20Clinic%20wrote."><u>physical therapists</u></a>. The National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine reports the EHR is a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK552608/"><u>major contributor</u></a> to clinician burnout. Patient experience is <a href="https://www.kff.org/other/poll-finding/data-note-publics-experiences-with-electronic-health-records/"><u>mixed</u></a>, though the public is <a href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/issue-briefs/2021/07/most-americans-want-to-share-and-access-more-digital-health-data"><u>still concerned</u></a> about privacy, errors, interoperability and access to their own records.</p>
<p>The EHR promised a lot: better accuracy, streamlined care, and patient-accessible records. In February 2009, the Obama administration <a href="https://www.healthcapital.com/hcc/newsletter/6_09/HITECH.pdf"><u>passed</u></a> the HITECH Act on this promise, investing $36 billion to scale up health information technology. No more deciphering bad handwriting for critical info. Efficiency and cost-savings could get more people into care. We imagined cancer and rare disease registries to research treatments. We wanted portable records accessible in an emergency. We wanted to rapidly identify the spread of highly contagious respiratory illnesses and other public health crises.</p>
<p>Why had the lofty ambition of health information, backed by enormous resources, failed so spectacularly?&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>A history</b>
</p>
<p>Medicine narrates the beginning of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9599146/#:~:text=The%20book%2C%20a%20compilation%20of,including%20physicians'%20recommendations%2C%20descriptions%20of"><u>medical records</u></a> with the 2500 year-old Hippocratic corpus. These books included <a href="https://lithub.com/what-the-worlds-first-medical-records-tell-us-about-ancient-life/"><u>individual patients’</u></a> courses, bearing witness, observing patterns and preserving a teaching library for future generations. This fused with a pedagogical approach that continued with the Romans, evolving into the medical advances of the Islamic Golden Age. Physician and philosopher Ibn Sina left hundreds of medical texts, as did Maimonides, the rabbi and physician in North Africa, that shaped medicine for centuries. Each of these collections had a version of: “Treat the patient, not the disease.”</p>
<p>While medieval Islamic <a href="https://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/islamic_medical/islamic_12.html"><u>hospitals</u></a> operated in the contemporary sense, European hospitals were <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/god-s-hotel-a-doctor-a-hospital-and-a-pilgrimage-to-the-heart-of-medicine-victoria-sweet/16598072?ean=9781594486548"><u>God’s hotel</u></a>, almshouses operated by nuns for the ill and poor. The Church <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1694293/"><u>excluded</u></a> women who were usually keepers of those traditions, absorbing the knowledge while <a href="https://www.akpress.org/calibanandthewitch.html"><u>burning</u></a> its practitioners. This effectively consolidated the Church’s authority. The same strategy was deployed in the Church’s colonial reach, extracting knowledge from other civilizations, while subjugating and erasing people. Colonization and military campaigns through the 18th and 19th century also brought back insight from battlefield surgery to the growing cities of Paris, Vienna and Berlin. The almshouses became academic medical centers. The records still held knowledge and teaching: junior surgeons kept detailed notes on patients, passing these notes to the next generation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 19th and 20th centuries’ rapid industrialization, urbanization, militarization, colonization, with its related bureaucratic expansion is—well beyond this brief history. Let’s say, it takes a lot of paperwork to run <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-658-34003-2_2"><u>empire</u></a> and <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/weber/"><u>industry</u></a>. A class of administrators grew to meet this need. State regulations also increased, requiring annual reports of hospital admissions, outcomes and expenditures, which meant increased standardization.</p>

<p>Dawn of the Flexner Report&nbsp;
</p>
<p>While medical administration proliferated, so did instruments (stethoscopes, ophthalmoscopes, thermometers) that could “perceive more deeply.” This changed what constituted <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3116347/"><u>medical information</u></a>, shifting focus from interview (emphasis on patient’s testimony) to physical exam (emphasis on the clinician’s observations). The charge was led by the “French School,” especially Jean-Nicolas Corvisart, Napoleon’s personal physician. Later, German physicians argued that we ought to center lab technology, further removing the patient’s authority. Lab findings were more “pure”: a <i>truthier truth.&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></p>
<p>These trends reached apotheosis in the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3178858/"><u>1910 Flexner Report</u></a>, which shapes US medical education to this day. Abraham Flexner was neither a scientist nor a physician. He was an educator, whose early <a href="https://www.loc.gov/item/08030713/">work</a> criticized rigid curricula and over-emphasis on research. This attracted notice from the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3178858/"><u>Hopkins Circle</u></a> (described by a Yale medical professor as a “particularly American…aristocracy of excellence…not defined by one’s origins or wealth, although wealth permitted the group’s recommendations to be successful.”) The group had just recruited William Osler, the Canadian physician fond of pithy aphorisms like “varicose veins are the result of improper selection of grandparents.” Osler continued an ancient framework: “The good physician treats the disease; the great physician treats the patient who has the disease.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3178858/"><u>Flexner Report</u></a> diverged from Flexner’s earlier work, calling to <i>increase </i>standardization and scientific research in medical education. If Osler carried the tradition of centering the patient, this report was the German academic clinic, where the patient was second to professor. Funding from Carnegie and Rockefeller foundations enabled rapid implementation of this “lab-centered” model. Of 160 MD-conferring institutions in 1904, only 66 stood by 1935. Only two of five Black medical schools remained. The report advised to continue segregation (with ongoing <a href="https://daily.jstor.org/the-1910-report-that-unintentionally-disadvantaged-minority-doctors/"><u>ramifications</u></a>) and limiting physician numbers (scarcity was good business). This reversed the decision to admit women. Meanwhile Harry S. Plummer (a Mayo Clinic founder) urged medical records to mimic business and economic reports, with more graphs, diagrams and lab data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fusing scientific methods with clinical care (and funding) did yield powerful 20th century medical “blockbusters”: insulin, surgical techniques, antibiotics, chemotherapy. More data also necessitated more data management, requiring more labor. The electronic record emerged in the 1960s. It required tediously converting paper data into punch cards, but enabled large-scale medical research, economic analysis and administration.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Patient R could not return. Despite concerning symptoms and possible exposure, he wasn’t concerned with HIV testing. He could not get a psychiatry appointment in the 4 months since moving here and needed meds. The team conferred: we could run the viral test if I canceled another less critical test. Each order I canceled, and each order I entered, printed multiple pages to the lab. The tech gathered, sorted and manually entered revisions into the lab company’s separate computer system. What would have been, years ago, a brief list written on a paper carried to the lab, had become a more baffling and arduous procedure.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<h6><b>Hope for Change: Scaling the EHR</b></h6>
<p>In 2008, a young president promising hope steps into a global financial meltdown. Barack Obama was a former law professor at the University of Chicago, where he met the behavioral economists Cass Sunstein. That year, Sunstein, with Richard Thaler (eventual Nobel-laureate) published the book <i>Nudge</i>, arguing for a policy framework based on behavioral economics. Instead of heavy-handed regulations, governments should shape the “choice architecture” that individuals face, to favor more rational choices (defined by the economists). Examples: change an “opt out” choice into “opt in” (dispense plastic utensils with takeout only if asked); or rearranging visual layouts (display water more prominently than soda). Sunstein called this “libertarian paternalism.” Instead of resource-intense interventions risking fraught political negotiations, nudging offered politically-neutral, no-cost, minimalist interventions, based on science.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a very appealing promise! Obama embraced a <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/61724/nudge-ocracy"><u>lineage</u></a> of liberal technocrats, confident of a “third way” to preserve free markets <i>and</i> address social needs. Obama brought on Sunstein and Thaler, eventually opening a “Nudge Unit,” helmed by a neuroscientist. Policy would now be informed by psychology, behavioral economics and other “decision sciences.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Obama wanted a massive government stimulus to stabilize the economy. This stimulus needed targets. He proposed one such target: “every doctor’s office and hospital in this country is using cutting-edge technology and electronic medical records so that we can cut red tape, prevent medical mistakes and help save billions of dollars each year.” This was a ready-to-go (if underfunded) Bush project. In 2009, the HITECH Act injected vast amounts of money into scaling health information technology.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>And they kind of did it! In 2008,<a href="https://www.healthit.gov/data/quickstats/national-trends-hospital-and-physician-adoption-electronic-health-records"><u> only 9%</u></a> of hospitals used an EHR. By 2011, 50% had implemented EHR. Now 96% of hospitals use a federally-certified EHR system. Obama’s vision had accelerated a new era.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So why was everyone complaining? In 2018, Atul Gawande published a piece in <i>The New Yorker </i>called “<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/11/12/why-doctors-hate-their-computers"><u>Why Doctors Hate Their Computers</u></a>.” He described what physicians experienced daily with the newly installed EHR at Harvard’s hospitals: redundancy, complexity, wasted time. A hospital administrator responded that this doctor dissatisfaction was irrelevant, the EHR was <i>for</i> patients.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The patients were also experiencing trouble, not least of which was that their clinicians spent visits squinting at screens. KFF Health News <a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/death-by-a-thousand-clicks/"><u>reported</u></a> (a decade and $36 billion after the HiTECH Act) a long trail of EHR-related errors resulting in death and serious injury. Medication lists did not update with changed prescriptions. Glitches linked one patient’s medical note to another’s file. Lawsuits were filed for failure to flag critical test results to medical teams, delaying time-sensitive treatment. A central premise of HITECH had been accessible records for patients and families. The administration’s own vice president Joe Biden could not transfer his son’s cancer treatment records from one hospital to another.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/e529ilab8frl/5S778EbGJErosGOp3BIsHU/8a0c5408052c27c6089accd913d6937f/tyelonol_options_1_.PNG" alt="tylenol options"></p><p><b>The rushed implementation&nbsp;</b></p>

<p>The goal of a stimulus is to push cash into the economy as quickly as possible. This is not the same goal as building a sensible and sustainable digital infrastructure. With threats and subsidies, the federal government pressured EHR vendors to rapidly meet government certification, then pressured the clinics/hospitals to purchase and implement the product. Rusty Frantz, the CEO of NextGen, confessed to <a href="https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/tech/death-by-1-000-clicks-where-electronic-health-records-went-wrong"><u>KFF</u></a> that “the software wasn’t implemented in a way that supported care, it was installed in a way that supported stimulus.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Achieving speed is perhaps why, among other shortcuts, software made for billing was commandeered into the more complex EHR functions. In contrast, the Veteran Administration’s (VA) EHR VistA, created in 1983, had developers work directly with clinical staff to prioritize intuitive workflow; it has consistently <a href="https://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/everybody-hates-vista-not-its-users#:~:text=For%20starters%2C%20annual%20Medscape%20EHR,off%2Dthe%2Dshelf%20vendors.&amp;text=VistA%20developers%20who%20wrote%20its,ideal%20system%20would%20look%20like."><u>outranked</u></a> all other EHRs in user satisfaction. Speed is also why interoperability was not prioritized. Consider as a counterexample the global system of ATMs, developed in the 1980s. Achieving interoperability required standardized network elements. This in turn required international political negotiations to agree on shared technical specifications. The American EHR is instead a patchwork of disconnected proprietary systems created by over 700 vendors, what the KFF report called “an electronic bridge to nowhere.” Medical staff, patients and families instead resort to older technology (CD-ROMs, fax, notebooks) to move critical information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>David Blumenthal, a HITECH architect, acknowledged that, in retrospect, it may have been more effective to build interoperability at the start. Then-chief technology officer Aneesh Chopra argued that rushing was necessary, a move-fast-break-things situation to be refined later. So now 96% of the nation’s hospitals are locked into a disjointed, shoddy infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>
<h6><b>Perverse business incentives</b>
</h6>
<p>Healthcare isn’t structured around patient needs; it is a business that prioritizes profit. EHR vendors rushed to claim stimulus money and market share. Economists call this rational, but also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perverse_incentive"><u>perverse</u></a>. It has paid off: despite lawsuits, fraud accusations and prosecutions for rushed, error-prone products, EHR is now a $28 billion industry and growing. Financial incentives also shape hospitals and private practices, who lose revenue when patients go to other institutions; there is no financial reward to sharing medical charts, nor the proprietary data entangled in it. Then there is liability. Thousands of patient deaths, injuries and near misses are attributed EHR errors, but this is only what is known. EHR vendors implemented “gag clauses,” on buyers, preventing disclosures of safety issues. Medical institutions allegedly withheld records to cover mistakes as well.</p>
<p>Surely this is fixable? Gawande listed experiments his hospital tried to improve the EHR: time-intensive tailoring of the interface and developing an ecosystem of apps (the hospital and EHR vendor resisted both). The hospital also hired scribes to free up doctors’ time. The American Medical Association has a <a href="https://www.ama-assn.org/practice-management/ama-steps-forward/practice-innovation-strategies-ehr-improvements"><u>toolkit</u></a> of ideas like delegating inbox duties and “getting rid of stupid stuff” (<a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1809698"><u>GROSS</u></a>). The most recent solution for interoperability has been the cloud. This replaces the high cost of in-house operations with a subscription. Large hospital systems have begun migrating records into <a href="https://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/mount-sinai-moves-more-epic-workloads-azure-cloud"><u>Microsoft</u></a> and <a href="https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/health-tech/google-epic-ink-deal-migrate-hospital-ehrs-cloud-ramp-use-ai-analytics"><u>Google</u></a><u> subscriptions</u>. These are the companies with the scale, experience, security and analytic capacity to support the massive edifice of medical records. This degree of consolidation raises <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6745146/"><u>another set of</u></a> <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2772442523000576"><u>concerns</u></a> about privacy, security and data ownership within an industry already <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2023/07/17/ai-regulation-google-health-epic/"><u>fighting federal </u></a>patient protections, with a <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2023/05/us-big-tech-must-be-regulated-to-protect-human-rights-despite-us-supreme-court-decision/"><u>spotty human rights record</u></a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The Technocratic Veneer on Institutional Problems</b></p>
<p><i>Technology does not bypass labor, it re-organizes it</i>&nbsp;
</p>
<p>By 2017, Obama despaired, “there are still just mountains of paperwork…and the doctors still have to input stuff, and the nurses are spending all their time on all this administrative work...”</p>
<p>There is an illusion that technology automates work—instead it <a href="https://hbr.org/2021/11/automation-doesnt-just-create-or-destroy-jobs-it-transforms-them#:~:text=Technology%20does%20not%20purge%20the,automation's%20better%20days%20%E2%80%94%20were%20shortchanged"><u>only changes it</u></a>. Someone must still tediously punch the cards and maintain them. The hype around novel technology <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/ai-artificial-intelligence-humans-technology-business-factory.html"><u>inflates its capacity</u></a>, obscuring how it requires an old capitalist foundation: cheap labor. Automation is often used as a threat to <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/what-the-luddites-really-fought-against-264412/"><u>drive down wages</u></a> rather than improve conditions. Digitizing healthcare can create well-paid programmers and administrators. It <i>also</i> relies on outsourcing cheaper, invisible, <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2016/01/child-labour-behind-smart-phone-and-electric-car-batteries/"><u>less regulated</u></a> labor: mining raw materials, manufacturing, shipping, precarious contractors, and vast armies of <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/ai-artificial-intelligence-humans-technology-business-factory.html"><u>human intelligence</u></a> to train artificial intelligence. The maps of those labor markets often overlap significantly with the map of former colonies.</p>
<p>Technology is frequently touted as a method for eliminating bureaucracy, yet it just as easily <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0016328721001956"><u>enables</u></a> its expansion. <a href="https://www.athenahealth.com/knowledge-hub/practice-management/expert-forum-rise-and-rise-healthcare-administrator"><u>Between 1975-2010</u></a>, the number of physicians grew 150%, same as population; healthcare administrators grew 3200%. Despite that expansion, the EHR still re-routes hidden administrative work back to direct-service labor like physicians, nurses, and pharmacists. Hours once spent with patients are now spent on <a href="https://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196(16)30215-4/fulltext"><u>clerical labor</u></a>. One physician told KFF, “I have yet to see the CEO who, while running a board meeting, takes minutes, and certainly I’ve never heard of a judge who, during the trial, would also be the court stenographer. But in medicine … we’ve asked the physician to move from writing in pen to [entering a computer] record, and it’s a pretty complicated interface.”</p>
<p>This is not mere data entry. Digitizing health records demands significant cognitive labor to<i> translate</i> clinical information. A hospital’s daily 137 terabytes of medical information (messy, unstructured narratives and images, in fluid categories evolved over millennia) must be converted into highly-structured data legible to the EHR. The promise of <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-022-00742-2"><u>machine learning and AI</u></a> is premised on this extra labor, taken from patient care and workers’ personal time (physicians take home an average 1-2 hours of extra uncompensated charting). “It’s no secret that healthcare is a data-driven business,” <u>notes</u> a health IT trade magazine. Providers interpret clinical realities into forms that can train “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1532046419302564"><u>data-hungry</u></a>” proprietary algorithms. Rather than decreasing clinician workload, the EHR extracts it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I go back to my computer to examine why my test order did not go through. I type “HIV” into an order box, which pulls dozens of options. Some are distinct tests (viral load, antibody, genotype) requiring knowledge to choose appropriately. Others are the same orders but for other clinics sharing the EHR: labs for a Texas site pull up for a patient in St. Louis. I skip the search and navigate to a menu of tests exclusive to our site. This brings up two identically-named lab menus in the same column. Expanding one menu sends the lab order to “external interface.” There is a second button: “outside collection.” But to properly order the test, I needed to have clicked the third button, “external interface-outside collection.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have worked in many settings. My clinic’s EHR non-sequiturs are not unique. Most institutions are eager to respond to feedback. The order menus now default to the correct button. To improve the EHR I am usually advised to personalize a menu toolbar, generate templates (“dot phrases”) and streamline the interface. If ambitious, I could join a committee to, over weeks, remove duplicate menus. Or, if I want to make it home, I can jerry-rig yet another work-around for the hundreds of inevitable idiosyncrasies.</p>
<p>A front-end investment of time promises eventual efficiency. Seems reasonable! Each EHR, however, is specific to each site, even with the same software. Providers commonly round at multiple hospitals, clinics, nursing facilities, even under one employer, sometimes in the same building. Each facility’s Epic (the dominant EHR) has a distinct interface. Painstakingly built menus, phrases and unique shortcuts developed in one context cannot transfer to another. Orders have different names and codes. Muscle memory is useless. (In contrast, the VA’s 1983 VistA designers, knowing clinicians rotate through services, focused on only two goals: patient care and rapid adaptability). It is time-consuming and none of this is actual patient care.</p>
<p>Adapting the EHR to be more useful is Sisyphean. So is navigating the sheer volume of signal it produces. An ICU clinician receives 7000 passive alerts a day, making it difficult to discern critical signals from noise. American <a href="https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/ehrs/u-s-physicians-notes-4x-as-long-as-those-of-physicians-overseas-3-things-to-know.html"><u>medical notes</u></a> are twice as long as a decade ago, many times longer than notes across the globe, from repetitive cut-and-pastes. The next person must sort through all this to find what’s relevant.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is no Hippocratic corpus. We have traveled far from the attentive observations meant to bear witness and teach future healers. For most of our workday, we treat neither patient nor disease.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If we resist or slip, the EHR is ready-made<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30821896/"><u> surveillance</u></a>, with swift consequences. In December 2020, deep in a COVID-19 winter surge, I covered my colleague’s patients on a weekend. I ended the 15-hour day by charting, billing and tying loose ends. The next week I received an email, threatening to suspend my privileges. The message opened sternly: “Timely and accurate completion of medical records is essential for quality of care and an important step for patient safety.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reader, of course I panicked. Physician-writer Emily Silverman <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/01/health/epic-electronic-health-records.html"><u>wrote</u></a>, sure, healthcare workers are “motivated by compassion and a love of medical science, but also a desire for external validation.” Like most people, we do not like to be monitored and berated. Eventually, I found that the system had auto-flagged a pended note draft for a patient I never saw. I create such drafts to abstract info from each chart before rounding. The patient did well and went home before I saw them. There was no patient safety at stake. The EHR sent a polite reminder (among dozens) to my inbox, which I missed. Why would I sign into <i>that </i>hospital’s Epic, when I was now overwhelmed with work in <i>another </i>hospital’s Epic? Amid a global health emergency requiring all hands-on deck, in a hospital that had just run out of ventilators, decked in posters saluting its heroes, I stopped everything to clear my inbox.</p>
<p><i>It is not only the technology increasing labor&nbsp;</i></p>
<p>The EHR and its administrative burden contributes to burnout. There is <i>also</i> more clinical work. Increasing corporatization of medicine and staff shortages have increased the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK2657/"><u>volume of patient care</u></a> for each healthcare worker, <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jan.15690"><u>accelerated</u></a> since the pandemic. In Gawande’s <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/11/12/why-doctors-hate-their-computers"><u>report</u></a>, the hospital hired human scribes to document, freeing the doctor’s time to focus on patients. The doctors remained burnt out because the hospital then gave them even more patients. Even when unions are strong, such as with California nurses, hospitals cut non-unionized ancillary staff, effectively increasing the work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This trend is accelerated by the incursion of private equity, which has<a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/private-equity-takeover-health-care-cities-specialties"><u> rapidly expanded</u></a> in healthcare. Private equity now has large market shares in anesthesiology, obstetrics, dentistry, radiology, nursing homes, and even <a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/hospices-private-equity-firms-end-of-life-care/"><u>lucrative end-of-life care</u></a>. Private equity’s central goal is short-term profit, not healthcare. This is achieved through aggressive “efficiencies:” loopholes to increase billing, cutting services, increasing invasive procedures, cutting staff, and employing staff with less training than previously required. This model has generated large profits, while the “perverse incentives” create <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama-health-forum/fullarticle/2795946"><u>worse care</u></a>, higher cost, and detriment to workforce infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Obama era’s faith in technological overhaul did not fix a fractured healthcare system that, like all profit-driven enterprises, squeezes labor before margins.&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Technology matters less than the social determinants for health</i>
</p>
<p>In Akshay Pendyal’s <a href="https://compactmag.com/article/the-soft-tyranny-of-modern-medicine"><u>excellent essay</u></a> about the insidious role of Nudge theory in medicine, he identifies the specific outrageousness of transmuting social failures into individual responsibilities. Rather than address the material insecurity of a patient with congestive heart failure (compelling her to do grueling work in an Amazon warehouse) nudge theory offers “one-weird-trick” suggestions like pill boxes that buzz medication reminders. “Such efforts,” Pendyal remarks, “seem futile at best—and at worst, bordering on cruel.” Nudging misdirects attention from institutions, social structures, and resource distribution, towards correcting individual behavior. We nudge the patient’s obesity, addictions, and noncompliance with doctor’s orders. This focus contradicts a century of medicine’s own rigorous research that medical “blockbuster” treatments matter, but not as much as the <a href="https://health.gov/healthypeople/priority-areas/social-determinants-health"><u>systemic determinants of health</u></a>: housing, material security, safety from violence, community support, public infrastructure and environmental stewardship, that shape things like access to clean water.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Digitizing medical information is useful; but it does not address problems that require redistributing resources, nor bring the people most impacted by policy to the table. That change requires politics. If it’s “perverse incentives”all around, perhaps, as economist Kenneth Arrow argued in 1963, markets <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~jay/health_class/Readings/Lecture01/arrow.pdf"><u>don’t work</u></a> in this setting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Effective politically-neutral, no-cost, minimalist interventions are rare. As to based-on-science: nudging and behavioral economics repeatedly evoke <i>science </i>to claim it is beyond politics<i>. </i>Sunstein himself, when running the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (where he bragged that he had issued fewer regulations than the Reagan, Bush, Clinton, and W. Bush administrations) insisted on the organization’s apolitical stance because it was scientific, even as it regularly met with lobbyists.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pendyal observed at a Nudge in Healthcare symposium, the repeated attempts to ground behavior economics, however tenuously, in neurobiology. Like the clinician’s gaze and lab data usurping the patient’s testimony, behavioral economics claims the “truthier truth.” Perhaps this insistence is necessary because the science in question is not good. Behavioral economics and its adjacent fields are undergoing a <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/10/09/they-studied-dishonesty-was-their-work-a-lie"><u>crisis of replication</u></a>—in which some of the field’s splashiest are accused of, at best, “p-hacking” (massaging the data until something pops out) and at worst, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/846cc7a5-12ee-4a44-830e-11ad00f224f9"><u>blatant fabrication.</u></a> The ease with which bad science dominated policy may just be the most recent iteration of Max Weber’s observations: these frameworks are less natural science and more rationalizing the ruling class’s methods of disciplining the laboring class.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Sunstein’s <i>Nudge</i>, you’re stalled by misleading logic before getting to scientific methodology. Sunstein cites highway signs reminding drivers to “click it or ticket!” as a nudge example. However, that “nudge” works because the government deployed command-and-control regulations: requiring auto-manufacturers to include seat belts and people to use them, under threat of fine. Robert Kuttner wryly <a href="https://harpers.org/archive/2014/12/obamas-obama/"><u>noted</u></a> that behavioral economics was initially a <i>critique</i> of neoclassical economics’ “rational” agent. The early rigorous experiments of Kahneman, Thaler and others demonstrated that human beings deviate from this model of “rationality”. In Sunstein’s hands, criticism of economics’ failure to grasp true human behavior becomes instead: a criticism of humans for failing to meet the premises of economics. The markets are working exactly as they ought to, it is the humans that must be corrected.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those corrections are <a href="https://monoskop.org/images/9/92/Foucault_Michel_The_Birth_of_the_Clinic_1976.pdf"><u>exacted</u></a> on individual bodies, in workplaces, education, prisons, and the clinic: workers are surveilled; medical education is reshaped in the vision of Carnegie and Rockefeller; racial hierarchy is <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9495470/"><u>naturalized</u></a>, including by <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10589311/"><u>large language models</u></a>; disabled “unproductive” bodies are crushed; gender roles (and associated care labor) are enforced by withholding reproductive and transgender care.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So why had the lofty ambition of health information failed so spectacularly? It did not fail entirely. It failed us, the workers, patients and public, but it is not <i>for</i> us. Bad EHR technology dominates because it serves enterprise first. Sunstein’s arguments are illogical, disconnected, and founded on preposterous data, but it serves the Obama administration’s <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/61724/nudge-ocracy"><u>ideology</u></a>. If weak science and bad technology emerge from the marketplace of ideas, it is because the highest bidder is the ruling class. Political will is exerted, but veiled with “science” to insist those in power know what’s best. Meanwhile, individualism means the consequences always fall to those they rule. From the Hopkins Circle to the Chicago School of Economics to the Silicon Valley libertarians: mechanisms of control are cloaked in what social theorist Marco D’eramo <a href="https://newleftreview.org/sidecar/posts/scientific-capitalism"><u>described</u></a> as the “neo-feudalism of a cognitive aristocracy, whereby alleged superiority of knowledge or competence entitles a select few to rule over the ignorant masses.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps part of the rage of the rank-and-file healthcare worker crushed by the EHR, is partly because we thought maybe <i>we</i> were among the cognitive aristocracy. Alongside the scientists, social workers, artists, and <a href="https://logicmag.io/clouds/agile-and-the-long-crisis-of-software/"><u>engineers</u></a> of the <a href="https://www.dissentmagazine.org/online_articles/on-the-origins-of-the-professional-managerial-class-an-interview-with-barbara-ehrenreich/"><u>professional managerial class</u></a>, our knowledge and competence was supposed to protect our autonomy, even as our work was deployed to control others. “What has happened to the professional middle class has long since happened to the blue-collar working class,”<a href="https://rosalux.nyc/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ehrenreich_death_of_a_yuppie_dream90.pdf"><u> observed</u></a> Barbara and John Ehrenreich, “Those of us who have college and higher degrees have proved to be no more indispensable, as a group, to the American capitalist enterprise than those who honed their skills on assembly lines or in warehouses or foundries.”</p>
<p>R’s HIV testing was negative. He remains ill. Because he does not have HIV, we are not funded to find out why. We printed lists of other clinics with long waiting lists. In any case, he had to focus on fighting to keep his housing. Anthropologist David Graeber wrote, “we were constantly being told that work is a virtue in itself—it shapes character or somesuch—but nobody believed that. Most of us felt work was best avoided, that is, unless it benefited others. But of work that did, whether it meant building bridges or emptying bedpans, you could be rightly proud. And there was something else we were definitely proud of: that we were the kind of people who took care of each other.” We, the physicians, nurse practitioners, nurses, medical assistants, case managers, lab technicians could only do what we could do for R, before turning to the long line of other patients. In the end, our inboxes were clear.</p>
<hr>
<p>Medicine did not start with Hippocrates, despite how medicine tells it. Even our ancient cousins the <a href="https://theconversation.com/neanderthals-cared-for-each-other-and-survived-into-old-age-new-research-93110"><u>Neanderthals cared</u></a> for their sick. Healing traditions are fundamental to human survival. Science is the careful observation of patterns, experimentation, and sharing knowledge. Technology, Ursula Le Guin has <a href="https://sentiers.media/notes/rant-about-technology/"><u>argued</u></a>, is how a tool-making species interacts with its material world. Which is to say, these things belong to all of us. There have always been other ways to do things.</p>
<hr>
<p>What does radically improved healthcare look like? Mark Olin Wright once described <a href="https://jacobin.com/2015/12/erik-olin-wright-real-utopias-anticapitalism-democracy/"><u>4 types of anticapitalists</u></a>. Using that framework, we imagine a different healthcare on his four strategies of change.&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. <i>Smashing the existing system.</i> When an existing system is completely intolerable, the ruptures of political revolution show glimpses of radical possibilities. There is no call to smash the healthcare system, but the COVID-19 pandemic may have been the rupture no one asked for. Despite scientific prowess and resources, the pandemic strained the American healthcare system revealing its deep fissures, failures, hypocrisies, and instabilities. The devastating US death rate, inequality and rush to re-open commerce laid bare the state’s priorities. The frightening collapse of even sophisticated health-care infrastructure (such as in <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(19)30344-7/fulltext"><u>Venezuela</u></a>) is not theoretical. Medication, supply, and staff shortages, as well as instability from private equity profiteering, stress the system. Arguably, there is already regional collapse in the rural United States, such as in <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/05/19/hhs-announces-over-65-million-address-maternal-health-crisis-invest-new-approaches-care.html"><u>obstetrics and maternal health</u></a>. Building on the ashes, however, requires more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. <i>Taming the current system</i>. This approach mitigates harm, though not with the non-solutions of nudging or technocratic veneers. Instead, it would require robust, meaningful prioritization of patients, labor, and community. It would mean securing the material infrastructure (housing, racial equity, clean water) that most shape the conditions of human health. This requires political organization, but it has been<a href="https://m.ufcw1500.org/get-educated/what-unions-have-done-for-you"><u> done before</u></a> and is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/08/business/economy/labor-strikes.html"><u>building power</u></a> now. It would require solidarity – physicians would have to stop identifying with capital or the cognitive aristocracy. It requires solidarity among formally-educated colleagues (pharmacists, mid-level practitioners, nurses) <i>and</i> technicians, food prep, custodial, transportation, and home health aids. Healthcare workers would have to join with other <a href="https://www.seiu.org/"><u>service and care workers</u></a> and unpaid care labor who make health possible. It would require coordinating with disability rights activists, community organizers and patient advocates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. <i>Escaping the system.</i> It can appear that the system is too large and overwhelming to change, in which case it is tempting to leave it entirely. There are multiple flavors of this:&nbsp; alternative medicine, concierge medicine, and Goop-flavored consumerism. Not everyone can escape of course—individuals or families perhaps, if they have the luck of no serious illness, injury, or disability requiring interdependence, or enough resources to buy the support. As insidious and exclusive as escaping can be, there is still something here. What is at the heart of what a “wellness spa” provides? Leisure, gentle touch, warm water and pleasure. Why should this not be part of what everyone deserves?&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. <i>Erosion. </i>There are always cracks, in which one can build small experiments of alternative care systems. These do not promote the escape of individuals, but of collective care. This is creating and expanding viable alternatives in the ruptures of an intolerable system. In the policed streets of Oakland, the Black Panthers organized not only self-defense squads but also Survival programs. They provided free breakfast for kids, transportation for disabled persons and <a href="https://hyphenmagazine.com/magazine/issue-25-generation-spring-2012/panthers-patients-asian-health-services"><u>free health clinics</u></a>. So too did founders of Clinica de la Raza, Asian Health Services, and Food Not Bombs. The Panthers were threatening enough that J. Edgar Hoover tried to take them out. The threat also pushed Lyndon B Johnson to co-opt those mutual aid programs into the War on Poverty, building a network of federally qualified health centers, which now provides not-for-profit care for over 30 million people.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Would the Panthers have made more radical changes if not suppressed? Yes, but their legacy of radical self-organization demonstrated the viability (and threat) of organizing. So did the <a href="https://www.gmhc.org/history/"><u>Gay Men's Health Crisis</u></a> providing care during the HIV crisis and ACT-UP’s direct action <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/02/09/689924838/how-to-demand-a-medical-breakthrough-lessons-from-the-aids-fight"><u>demanding scientific</u></a> and public health attention. Harm reduction, now a pillar of public health, began as the <a href="https://rumahcemara.or.id/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Harm-Reduction-as-Anarchist-Practice.pdf"><u>anarchic practice</u></a> of injection drug users risking arrest to distribute clean syringes to avoid infections. Erosion is far more common than institutional technocrats, who savvily adopt and claim the interventions as their own, would admit.&nbsp;</p>
