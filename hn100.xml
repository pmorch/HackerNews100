<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="article-body">
<p>Apple is already testing the initial batch of processors produced for its devices by TSMC Arizona, reports <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Tech/Semiconductors/Apple-in-final-stages-of-verifying-TSMC-s-Made-in-USA-chips" data-url="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Tech/Semiconductors/Apple-in-final-stages-of-verifying-TSMC-s-Made-in-USA-chips" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">Nikkei Asia. </a>To begin with, the tests intend to compare the Arizona output to see if the quality is similar to chips produced in TSMC’s cutting-edge fabs in Taiwan. If the chip quality verification testing does not encounter any hiccups, the source says that the first batch of mass-produced chips from the Arizona fab is expected to arrive at iDevice makers as early as this quarter. If this is the case, Apple will likely be TSMC’s first American customer to use locally made chips. AMD and Nvidia will likely follow suit soon, as they’re also running wafer test production there.</p><p>The entry of locally produced chips in the American market is a big win for the United States’ push for silicon independence, especially as it massively relies on Taiwan for the majority of its most advanced chips. Taiwan is located in a high-risk location, with the belligerent CCP-controlled China having the island in its sights. The island is also prone to natural disasters, which can disrupt semiconductor production and result in supply crunch situations.</p><p>However, even if Apple gives the go signal to TSMC and the latter starts making chips in Arizona, the processors still need to be shipped back to Amkor in Taiwan for packaging until TSMC completes <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/semiconductors/apple-to-become-first-customer-for-amkors-dollar2-billion-arizona-chip-packaging-facility" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/semiconductors/apple-to-become-first-customer-for-amkors-dollar2-billion-arizona-chip-packaging-facility">its facility in Peoria, Arizona</a>. But whatever the case, this is a significant push in the right direction for the U.S., especially as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/tsmc-postpones-mass-production-at-arizona-fab-to-2025" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/tsmc-postpones-mass-production-at-arizona-fab-to-2025">Arizona fab has been delayed</a> for about a year due to various issues. Aside from TSMC and Amkor, other suppliers to these companies, like LCY Chemical, are also setting up in Arizona. That way, they could stay near their client and simplify logistics.</p><p>Despite <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/semiconductors/50-percent-of-tsmcs-arizona-employees-are-from-taiwan-despite-recent-controversies-company-plans-to-hire-more-us-workers-over-time" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/semiconductors/50-percent-of-tsmcs-arizona-employees-are-from-taiwan-despite-recent-controversies-company-plans-to-hire-more-us-workers-over-time">importing about half of its employees</a> from Taiwan, it seems that the common American is also slowly benefitting from TSMC’s presence in Arizona, especially as it’s reported that the company has started aggressive recruitment from American universities. It has also partnered with the Arizona State University for workforce development and research, helping drive American innovation.</p><p>After what seems to be its initial success with Apple, the Arizona fab is expected to output chips using more advanced technology. TSMC will produce 3nm chips in the U.S., and Taiwan has already <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/taiwanese-govt-clears-tsmc-to-make-2nm-chips-abroad-country-lowers-its-silicon-shield" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/taiwanese-govt-clears-tsmc-to-make-2nm-chips-abroad-country-lowers-its-silicon-shield">given TSMC the go-signal</a> to manufacture 2nm chips abroad. With the CHIPS and Science Act now bearing fruit, the U.S. could once again appear on the semiconductor production world map and give it more stability in its silicon supply chain.</p><div data-hydrate="true" id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-BCL5Yjuh2QQdA7CwKjWnX4"><section><p>Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.</p></section></div>

          <p>Texas has sued insurance provider Allstate, alleging that the firm and its data broker subsidiary used data from apps like GasBuddy, Routely, and Life360 to quietly track drivers and adjust or cancel their policies.</p>
<p>Allstate and Arity, a "mobility data and analytics" firm founded by Allstate in 2016, collected "trillions of miles worth of location data" from more than 45 million people, then used that data to adjust rates, according to Texas' lawsuit. This violates Texas' Data Privacy and Security Act, which requires "clear notice and informed consent" on how collected data can be used. A statement from Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said the suit is the first-ever state action targeting comprehensive data privacy violations.</p>
<p>“Our investigation revealed that Allstate and Arity paid mobile apps millions of dollars to install Allstate’s tracking software,” Paxton said in a statement. “The personal data of millions of Americans was sold to insurance companies without their knowledge or consent in violation of the law. Texans deserve better, and we will hold all these companies accountable.”</p>
<h2>Latitude, longitude, and future rates</h2>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/sites/default/files/images/press/Allstate%20and%20Arity%20Petition%20Filed.pdf">Texas' complaint</a> (PDF), the data collected included "a phone's geolocation data, accelerometer data, magnetometer data, and gyroscopic data, which monitors details such as the phone's altitude, longitude, latitude, bearing, GPS time, speed, and accuracy."</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article class="page" lang="en"><h2>The Shepherd 1.0.0 released!</h2><p lang="en">Ludovic Courtès — December 12, 2024</p><p>Finally, twenty-one years after its
<a href="https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/guile-user/2003-04/msg00007.html">inception</a>
(twenty-one!), the Shepherd leaves <a href="https://0ver.org/">ZeroVer</a>
territory to enter a glorious 1.0 era.  This 1.0.0 release is published
today because we think Shepherd has become a solid tool, meeting user
experience standards one has come to expect since systemd changed the
game of free init systems and service managers alike.  It’s also a major
milestone for <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/">Guix</a>, which has been relying on
the Shepherd from a time when doing so counted as <em>dogfooding</em>.</p><p>To celebrate this release, the amazing Luis Felipe López Acevedo
designed a new logo,
<a href="https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/shepherd/graphics.git">available</a>
under CC-BY-SA, and the project got <a href="https://gnu.org/software/shepherd">a proper web
site</a>!</p><p><img src="https://guix.gnu.org/static/blog/img/shepherd-logo.svg" alt="Logo of the Shepherd."></p><p>Let’s first look at what the Shepherd actually <em>is</em> and what it can
do for you.</p><h2>At a glance</h2><p>The Shepherd is a minimalist but featureful service manager and as such,
it <em>herds services</em>: it keeps track of services, their state and their
dependencies, and it can start, stop, and restart them when needed.
It’s a simple job; doing it right and providing users with insight and
control over services is a different story.</p><p>The Shepherd consists of two commands: <code>shepherd</code> is the daemon that
manages services, and <code>herd</code> is the command that lets you interact with
it to inspect and control the status of services.  The <code>shepherd</code>
command can run as the first process (PID&nbsp;1) and serve as the “init
system”, as is the case on <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/manual/devel/en/html_node/Getting-Started-with-the-System.html">Guix
System</a>;
or it can manage services for unprivileged users, as is the case with
<a href="https://guix.gnu.org/manual/devel/en/html_node/Home-Configuration.html">Guix
Home</a>.
For example, running <code>herd status ntpd</code> as root allows me to know what
the Network Time Protocol (NTP) daemon is up to:</p><pre><code>$ sudo herd status ntpd
● Status of ntpd:
  It is running since Fri 06 Dec 2024 02:08:08 PM CET (2 days ago).
  Main PID: 11359
  Command: /gnu/store/s4ra0g0ym1q1wh5jrqs60092x1nrb8h9-ntp-4.2.8p18/bin/ntpd -n -c /gnu/store/7ac2i2c6dp2f9006llg3m5vkrna7pjbf-ntpd.conf -u ntpd -g
  It is enabled.
  Provides: ntpd
  Requires: user-processes networking
  Custom action: configuration

and I can open <code>/var/log/ntpd.log</code> to view more.  Running <code>herd stop ntpd</code> would terminate the <code>ntpd</code> process, and there’s also a <code>start</code> and

there’s a <code>configuration</code> action.  As it turns out, that action is a
handy way to get the file name of the <code>ntpd</code> configuration file:</p><pre><code>$ head -2 $(sudo herd configuration ntpd)

pool 2.guix.pool.ntp.org iburst</code></pre><p>Of course a typical system runs quite a few services, many of which
depend on one another.  The <code>herd graph</code> command returns a
representation of that <em>service dependency graph</em> that can be piped to
<code>dot</code> or <code>xdot</code> to visualize it; here’s what I get on my laptop:</p><p><img src="https://guix.gnu.org/static/blog/img/service-graph.svg" alt="Example of a service dependency graph."></p><p>It’s quite a big graph (you can zoom in for details!) but we can learn a
few things from it.  Each node in the graph is a service; rectangles are
for “regular” services (typically daemons like <code>ntpd</code>), round nodes
correspond to <em>one-shot services</em> (services that perform one action and
immediately stop), and diamonds are for <em>timed services</em> (services that
execute code periodically).</p><h2>Blurring the user/developer line</h2><p>A unique feature of the Shepherd is that you configure and extend it in
its own implementation language: in <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/guile">Guile
Scheme</a>.  That does <em>not</em> mean you
need to be an expert in that programming language to get started.
Instead, we try to make sure anyone can start simple for their
configuration file and gradually get to learn more if and when they feel
the need for it.  With this approach, we <em>keep the user in the loop</em>,
<a href="https://www.wingolog.org/archives/2011/10/19/the-user-in-the-loop">as Andy Wingo put
it</a>.</p><p>A Shepherd configuration file is a Scheme snippet that goes like this:</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>register-services</span>
  <span>(</span><span>list</span> <span>(</span><span>service</span> <span>'</span><span>(</span><span>ntpd</span><span>)</span> <span>…</span><span>)</span>
        <span>…</span><span>)</span><span>)</span>

<span>(</span><span>start-in-the-background</span> <span>'</span><span>(</span><span>ntpd</span> <span>…</span><span>)</span><span>)</span></code></pre><p>Here we define <code>ntpd</code> and get it started as soon as <code>shepherd</code> has read
the configuration file.  The ellipses can be filled in with more
services.</p><p>As an example, our <code>ntpd</code> service is defined like this:</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>service</span>
  <span>'</span><span>(</span><span>ntpd</span><span>)</span>
  <span>#:documentation</span> <span>"Run the Network Time Protocol (NTP) daemon."</span>
  <span>#:requirement</span> <span>'</span><span>(</span><span>user-processes</span> <span>networking</span><span>)</span>
  <span>#:start</span> <span>(</span><span>make-forkexec-constructor</span>
           <span>(</span><span>list</span> <span>"…/bin/ntpd"</span>
                 <span>"-n"</span> <span>"-c"</span> <span>"/…/…-ntpd.conf"</span> <span>"-u"</span> <span>"ntpd"</span> <span>"-g"</span><span>)</span>
           <span>#:log-file</span> <span>"/var/log/ntpd.log"</span><span>)</span>
  <span>#:stop</span> <span>(</span><span>make-kill-destructor</span><span>)</span>
  <span>#:respawn?</span> <span>#t</span><span>)</span></code></pre><p>The important parts here are <code>#:start</code> bit, which says how to start the
service, and <code>#:stop</code>, which says how to stop it.  In this case we’re
just spawning the <code>ntpd</code> program but other startup mechanisms are
supported by default: inetd, socket activation <em>à la</em> systemd, and
timers.  Check out the manual for
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/shepherd/manual/html_node/Service-Examples.html">examples</a>
and a
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/shepherd/manual/html_node/Defining-Services.html">reference</a>.</p><p>There’s no limit to what <code>#:start</code> and <code>#:stop</code> can do.  In Guix System
you’ll find services that <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/en/blog/2017/running-system-services-in-containers/">run daemons in
containers</a>,
that mount/unmount file systems (as can be guessed from the graph
above), that set up/tear down a static networking configuration, and a
variety of other things.  The
<a href="https://github.com/BIMSBbioinfo/swineherd">Swineherd</a> project goes as
far as extending the Shepherd to turn it into a tool to manage system
containers—similar to what the Docker daemon does.</p><p>Note that when writing service definitions for Guix System and Guix
Home, you’re targeting a <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/manual/devel/en/html_node/Shepherd-Services.html">thin
layer</a>
above the Shepherd programming interface.  As is customary in Guix, this
is <em>multi-stage programming</em>: G-expressions specified in the <code>start</code> and
<code>stop</code> fields are staged and make it into the resulting Shepherd
configuration file.</p><h2>New since 0.10.x</h2><p>For those of you who were already using the Shepherd, here are the
highlights compared to the 0.10.x series:</p><ul><li>Support for <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/shepherd/manual/html_node/Timers.html"><em>timed
services</em></a>
has been added: these services spawn a command or run Scheme code
periodically according to a predefined calendar.</li><li><code>herd status SERVICE</code> now shows high-level information about
services (main PID, command, addresses it is listening to, etc.)
instead of its mere “running value”.  It also shows recently-logged
messages.</li><li>To make it easier to discover functionality, that command also
displays <em>custom actions</em> applicable to the service, if any.  It
also lets you know if a replacement is pending, in which case you
can restart the service to upgrade it.</li><li><code>herd status root</code> is no longer synonymous with <code>herd status</code>;
instead it shows information about the <code>shepherd</code> process itself.</li><li>On Linux, <code>reboot --kexec</code> lets you reboot straight into a new Linux
kernel previously loaded with <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/8/kexec"><code>kexec --load</code></a>.</li></ul><p>The service collection has grown:</p><ul><li><p>The new <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/shepherd/manual/html_node/Log-Rotation-Service.html">log rotation
service</a>
is responsible for periodically rotating log files, compressing
them, and eventually deleting them.  It’s very much like similar log
rotation tools from the 80’s since <code>shepherd</code> logs to plain text
files like in the good ol’ days.</p><p>There’s a couple of be benefits that come from its integration into
the Shepherd.  First, it already knows all the files that services
log to, so no additional configuration is needed to teach it about
these files.  Second, log rotation is <em>race free</em>: no single line of
log can be lost in the process.</p></li><li><p>The new <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/shepherd/manual/html_node/System-Log-Service.html">system log
service</a>
what’s traditionally devoted to a separate <code>syslogd</code> program.  The
advantage of having it in <code>shepherd</code> is that it can start logging
earlier and integrates nicely with the rest of the system.</p></li><li><p>The <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/shepherd/manual/html_node/Timer-Service.html">timer
service</a>
provides functionality similar to the venerable <code>at</code> command,
allowing you to run a command at a particular time:</p></li></ul><pre><code>herd schedule timer at 07:00 -- mpg123 alarm.mp3</code></pre><ul><li>The <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/shepherd/manual/html_node/Transient-Service-Maker.html">transient service
maker</a>
lets you run a command in the background as a transient service (it
is similar in spirit to the <code>systemd-run</code> command):</li></ul><pre><code>herd spawn transient -d $PWD -- make -j4</code></pre><ul><li>The GOOPS interface that was deprecated in 0.10.x <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/shepherd/manual/html_node/Legacy-GOOPS-Interface.html">is now
gone</a>.</li></ul><p>As always, the <a href="https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/shepherd.git/tree/NEWS?id=dd911ac772989a7630b9f4d58f8b747cbc1c33fe"><code>NEWS</code>
file</a>
has additional details.</p><p>In the coming weeks, we will most likely gradually move service
definitions in Guix from
<a href="https://guix.gnu.org/manual/devel/en/html_node/Scheduled-Job-Execution.html#index-mcron_002dservice_002dtype">mcron</a>
to timed services and similarly replace
<a href="https://guix.gnu.org/manual/devel/en/html_node/Log-Rotation.html#index-rottlog_002dservice_002dtype">Rottlog</a>
and
<a href="https://guix.gnu.org/manual/devel/en/html_node/Base-Services.html#index-syslog_002dservice_002dtype"><code>syslogd</code></a>.
This should be an improvement for Guix users and system administrators!</p><h2>Cute code</h2><p>I did mention that the Shepherd is minimalist, and it really is: 7.4K
lines of Scheme, excluding tests, according to SLOCCount.  This is in
large part thanks to the use of a high-level memory-safe language and
due to the fact that it’s extensible—peripheral features can live
outside the Shepherd.</p><p>Significant benefits also come from the concurrency framework: the
<em>concurrent sequential processes</em> (CSP) model and
<a href="https://github.com/wingo/fibers">Fibers</a>.  Internally, the state of
each service <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/shepherd/manual/html_node/Service-Internals.html">is encapsulated in a
fiber</a>.
Accessing a service’s state amounts to sending a message to its fiber.
This way to structure code is itself very much inspired by the <em>actor
model</em>.  This results in simpler code (no dreaded event loop, no
callback hell) and better separation of concern.</p><p>Using a high-level framework like Fibers does come with its challenges.
For example, we had the case of a <a href="https://github.com/wingo/fibers/issues/109">memory leak in Fibers under certain
conditions</a>, and we
certainly don’t want that in PID&nbsp;1.  But the challenge really lies in
squashing those low-level bugs so that the foundation is solid.  The
Shepherd itself is free from such low-level issues; its logic is easy to
reason about and that alone is immensely helpful, it allows us to extend
the code without fear, and it avoids concurrency bugs that plague
programs written in the more common event-loop-with-callbacks style.</p><p>In fact, thanks to all this, the Shepherd is probably the <em>coolest init
system</em> to hack on.  It even comes with a
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/shepherd/manual/html_node/REPL-Service.html">REPL</a>
for live hacking!</p><h2>What’s next</h2><p>There’s a number of down-to-earth improvements that can be made in the
Shepherd, such as adding support for dynamically-reconfigurable services
(being able to restart a service but with different options),
integration with control groups (“cgroups”) on Linux, proper integration
for software suspend, etc.</p><p>In the longer run, we envision an exciting journey towards a
<a href="https://spritely.institute/news/spritely-nlnet-grants-december-2023.html">distributed and capability-style
Shepherd</a>.
<a href="https://spritely.institute/goblins/">Spritely Goblins</a> provides the
foundation for this; using it looks like a natural continuation of the
design work of the Shepherd: Goblins is an actor model framework!
Juliana Sims has been working on adapting the Shepherd to Goblins
and we’re eager to see what comes out of it in the coming year.  Stay
tuned!</p><h2>Enjoy!</h2><p>In the meantime, we hope you enjoy the Shepherd&nbsp;1.0 as much as we
enjoyed making it.  Four people contributed code that led to this
release, but there are <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/shepherd/contribute">other ways to
help</a>: through
graphics and web design, translation, documentation, and more.  Join us!</p><blockquote><p><em>Originally published on the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/shepherd/news/2024/12/the-shepherd-1.0.0-released/">Shepherd web

<hr>
<p>Europe is experiencing some weird times. From <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/ursula-von-der-leyen-power-play-exasperate-eu-capitals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">politics</a> to <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/europe-economic-apocalypse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">economy</a> and <a href="https://insideevs.com/news/744949/ev-sales-europe-november-2024/" data-inline-widget="internal-links" data-type-id="0" data-params="%7B%22article_edition_id%22%3A%22744949%22%2C%22section%22%3A%221%22%2C%22alias%22%3A%22ev-sales-europe-november-2024%22%7D">car sales</a>, it’s far from rosy, and arguably the biggest player in the electric vehicle game is having a rough year.</p>
<p>Eleven months into 2024, <a href="https://insideevs.com/tesla/" data-inline-widget="internal-links">Tesla</a> recorded a double-digit decrease in registrations, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA), which released <a href="https://www.acea.auto/pc-registrations/new-car-registrations-1-9-in-november-2024-year-to-date-battery-electric-sales-5-4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official figures for November</a>.</p>
<p>To be clear, Tesla is still one of the largest EV manufacturers in Europe and the United States, but its grip is weakening on the other side of the Atlantic. Last month, Tesla recorded a 40.9% decrease in registrations in the European Union compared to the same month last year. The number of registrations went from 31,810 in November 2023 to 18,786 last month, marking a decrease in market share from 3.6% to 2.2%.</p>

<p>Year-to-date, Tesla had 211,405 registrations in the EU, 15.2% fewer than last year’s 249,265 units.</p>
<p>It’s a similar story when the European Free Trade Association members and the United Kingdom are included in the mix. EFTA members include Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. On these markets, Tesla registrations went down 28.4% in November, from 36,563 units last year to 26,191 units this year, which made the American automaker’s market share go down from 3.4% to 2.5%.</p>
<p>Year-to-date, Tesla registrations in the EU, EFTA and UK went down 13.7% from 327,635 units in 2023 to 282,692 units this year, while the market share shrunk from 2.8% to 2.4%. In the EU alone, which has 27 member states, Tesla’s market share went down from 2.6% in the first 11 months of last year to 2.2% this year.</p>

<p>The automaker’s losses can be attributed to a number of factors, including the increasingly controversial attitude of its CEO, <a href="https://insideevs.com/news/category/elon-musk/" data-inline-widget="internal-links">Elon Musk</a>, and the decrease in government incentives. Some European states have reduced the amount of money offered toward the purchase of a new EV, while others have eliminated the incentives altogether.</p>
<p>That said, Tesla’s significant drop in European registrations has largely left the EV industry unaffected. Considering the sheer volume of electric cars sold by Tesla, EV registrations as a whole only went down by 1.4% in the EU, EFTA and UK from January to November and they actually went up 0.9% in November compared to last year. In the EU alone, EV registrations went down 5.4% year-to-date and 9.5% in November.</p>
<p>This can only mean one thing: other automakers have stepped up to try and fill the gap left by Tesla, and customers are following suit.</p>

<p>This year’s Lifetime Account Charity Fundraiser was a record-breaking success, generating over $1 million to directly support organizations fighting for privacy, freedom of expression, and human rights worldwide.</p>



<p>We’ve held our annual charity fundraiser since 2018, raffling off exclusive Lifetime Accounts while raising millions for the fight for a better internet. But this year, the community fundraiser exceeded all expectations, bringing our total charity contributions over the last <a href="https://proton.me/about/impact">seven years to over $4 million</a>.</p>



<p>The 2024 fundraiser brought in $927,470 from over 90,000 tickets sold to 43,631 participants. We’re donating a further $150,000, bringing the total donation amount to <strong>$1,077,470</strong>. This achievement is a testament to the power of this community and our ability to collectively build a better future.</p>



<p><strong>Scroll down to see if your raffle ticket is a winner!</strong></p>



<h3>The difference you’ve made</h3>



<p>Every ticket you purchased is more than just an entry into our exclusive raffle — it’s a vote for a freer, more open world. The funds raised this year will support 10 vital organizations selected by the Proton community, along with others we’ve supported in previous years. <a rel="" target="_self" href="https://proton.me/blog/2024-lifetime-account-charity-fundraiser">Learn more about the recipients in this article.</a></p>



<p>Thanks to your continued support, we have now distributed over $4  million in grants globally to aligned organizations. Beyond financial contributions, Proton also provides free access to our services in regions where privacy is under threat, supports open-source projects, and leads efforts to resist online censorship.</p>

We will never engage in search deals or user monetization—our commitment is purely to creating an open, user-centric browsing experience.

Every ticket purchased, every donation made, and every message shared contributes to a movement that’s bigger than all of us.</p>



<p>Thank you for helping us make 2024 a record-breaking year. Your support inspires us to continue building tools that empower people to take control of their digital lives.</p>



<p>Here’s to another year of progress together.</p>

<p>My work PC is an old potato, and Chrome makes its fans cry whenever I open a lot of tabs.

<p>For as long as I can remember, Chrome has been my go-to. All my passwords, bookmarks, and extensions are always available wherever I log into my Google account. I only use the browser on my PC, which is why I’ve never felt the need to upgrade it. At least until recently, when it started to struggle when I installed a couple of new Chrome extensions.</p>    
<p>I figured it’s finally time to <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/346541/how-to-upgrade-or-replace-your-pcs-ram/" target="_blank">add more RAM to this machine</a> or say farewell to it entirely. For the time being, I switched to Firefox. I made a new account for it and linked it to the sync chain on the PC and my phone. To my surprise, my old timer PC runs it just fine, even with a ton of tabs open. No more angry fan noises.</p>

<p>And even more surprisingly, Firefox does everything Chrome does. The sync works perfectly across devices. You get a huge selection of <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/719529/how-to-install-extensions-add-ons-in-mozilla-firefox/" target="_blank">browser add-ons</a>, and you can customize a lot of the interface. It even has many neat features that Chrome doesn’t.</p>    
<p>The one feature it doesn’t have is the ability to turn regular web pages into web apps that you can launch from the desktop or taskbar. That’s something I wish the devs would add, but except for this nitpick, I don’t think I’ll be switching back to Chrome. Let me try to convince you why you should try Firefox too.</p>    <h2 id="superior-tab-management">

               </h2>
<p>Other than the search tabs feature, managing tabs in Chrome hasn’t changed in almost two decades (I’m not counting “Tab Groups” because they’re messy and confusing). A lot of people keep countless tabs open and all Chrome gives you is a cramped-up bar filled with tiny buttons that hide the text. Good luck finding a tab without hovering over each one.</p>

<p>Firefox has similar tab bars and buttons, but it has something Chrome doesn’t: Firefox View. <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/841156/whats-new-in-firefox-106-available-now/" target="_blank">Firefox View</a> is a window where you can see all your open tabs in one place. It’s conveniently stashed in a corner and opens with a single click.</p>    



    



                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
    

<p>You can sort the open tabs by recent activity or just by tab order. You can also search for open tabs.</p>    
<p>You can cycle through recently closed tabs, the entire search history, and even the tabs you’ve got open on other devices—all easily accessible, searchable, and sortable. There’s also a recent browsing tab where all the open tabs, recent tabs, and tabs from other devices are pooled together.</p>    
<p>If you’re someone who keeps a lot of tabs open and wastes too much time rummaging through them, trust me, you’ll love Firefox View.</p>    <h2 id="built-in-pocket-so-you-never-lose-a-link">
                        Built-in Pocket So You Never Lose a Link
               </h2>
<p>You know when you don’t want to lose a link, but it’s also not important enough to bookmark? Firefox has a button for that. It’s called <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/260850/how-to-save-articles-for-reading-later-with-pocket/" target="_blank">Pocket</a> and it keeps all your links safe in a tidy little collection.</p>    
<p>Even more importantly, it does so with a single click. Just click the tiny Pocket icon next to the address bar once, and it’ll be added to your saved collection. The collection syncs directly with your Firefox profile, so you can access it anywhere.</p>    



    



                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
    

<p>To view your saves, you can open the Pocket app and find all your saved URLs in a beautiful layout. You can organize, tag, and archive the collections too.</p>    <h2 id="keep-your-real-email-safe">

<p>Any emails sent to these aliases will be forwarded to your real email address. That way, the real email addresses stay hidden, but you still get your mail sent to them. There is also a handy Firefox Relay extension that autofills these burners when you’re filling out forms with email addresses.</p>    
<p>Firefox makes it super convenient to take screenshots. You don’t need to install any clunky browser extensions. Just right click anywhere, and click “Take Screenshot.” You can choose a full-page view or select an area to capture. It also detects web page elements, so you can capture perfect rectangular or square screenshots.</p>    



    



                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
    

<p>I know Chrome has a screenshot tool hidden in the developer options, but it’s not user-friendly at all.</p>    <h2 id="handy-chatgpt-button-in-the-right-click-menu">

<p>If you use ChatGPT or other AI bots like it often, you’ll appreciate how Firefox handles them. In Firefox, you can quickly send ChatGPT a prompt with a single click.</p>

<p>Just right-click anywhere on any webpage (or select a chunk of text) and ask ChatGPT to “Summarize,” “Explain this,” or “Quiz me.” It’ll open an AI Chatbot panel on the side where you can ask follow-ups or tweak the original prompt. If you don't find it on your Firefox, open Settings and look for the "AI Chatbot" feature in your Firebox Labs settings.</p>    <h2 id="other-thoughtful-touches">

            Picture-In-Picture for Any Video

<p>On Firefox, you can pop out any video into its own little window. That way, you can watch multiple videos side by side, or work on other tabs or apps while the video plays in the corner. You can use this Picture in Picture feature by clicking the tiny pop-out icon that shows up when you play a video. Very handy.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://db-engines.com/en/blog">Blog</a> &gt; Post</p><p>by <a href="https://db-engines.com/en/users/Tom+Russell">Tom Russell</a>, 13 January 2025</p><p><span>DB-Engines is today announcing that </span><span>PostgreSQL is our DBMS of the Year for the second year in a row, </span><span>winning for </span><span>the fifth time overall.</span></p><p>DB-Engines is today announcing that PostgreSQL is our DBMS of the Year for the second year in a row, winning for the fifth time overall after also being top-ranked in 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2023. Second in the rankings was Snowflake, followed by Microsoft in third place. PostgreSQL has emerged as the most popular database management system over the past year, outpacing all other 423 monitored systems.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nearly 35 years ago, the database system known as Postgres made its debut. Since then, PostgreSQL has undergone significant transformations, driven by a continuous stream of enhancements that ensure it remains at the cutting edge of DBMS technology, while also offering a dependable and stable platform. PostgreSQL 17, launched in September 2024, introduced additional performance enhancements and expanded replication options, among other improvements. All of this continues to make PostgreSQL one of the most successful open-source projects ever.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Snowflake is the runner up and is a cloud-based data warehousing company that has gained significant traction in recent years. Its unique architecture allows for the separation of storage and compute, providing flexibility and scalability. Snowflake's support for multi-cloud environments and its data sharing capabilities have made it a popular choice for businesses looking to leverage cloud data warehousing. Snowflake's rise in the rankings reflects its growing influence and adoption in the industry.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Microsoft's Azure SQL Database and SQL Server continue to be strong contenders in the DBMS market. Azure SQL Database offers a fully managed relational database with AI-powered performance optimization and scalability. SQL Server, with its hybrid capabilities, allows for seamless integration between on-premises and cloud environments. Microsoft's commitment to innovation and its comprehensive suite of data services have solidified its position in the top ranks.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><big>Notes to editors</big></h2>

<h2>Methodology</h2>

<p>We calculate the DBMS of the year by subtracting the January 2024 from the January 2025 scores. We use the difference between each DBMS’s score, rather than a percentage growth, which would favor systems with lower popularity at the beginning of the year. The DMBS of the year is an illustration of how much each system increased in popularity during the year. You can read more about our exact <a href="https://db-engines.com/en/ranking_definition">methodology </a>here, but in short we are ranking popularity of DBMS based on how much people are discussing and communicating about each system, including job offers, professional profile entries and citations on the web. job offers, professional profile entries and citations on the web.&nbsp;</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The launch of congestion pricing led to some 43,000 fewer drivers on average entering Manhattan below 60th Street each weekday last week than would be typical for that time of January, according to data released by the MTA on Monday. The data comes just over a week after the tolls went live.</p><p>The decline in traffic only amounts to a 7.5% reduction compared to projections based on Januarys from the last few years, before congestion pricing was activated. Under the projections, an average of 583,000 drivers would enter the toll zone each day. But such a reduction, <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/in-first-days-of-congestion-pricing-new-yorkers-see-signs-of-reduced-gridlock" rel="noopener" target="_blank">many people in Manhattan have observed</a>, can be the difference between flowing traffic and gridlock.</p><p>“It has been a very good week here in New York,” MTA deputy chief Juliette Michaelson said at a news conference. She cautioned that congestion pricing had only been in effect for eight days and that traffic patterns could change.</p><p>Traffic times on all inbound crossings — like the Williamsburg Bridge and the Holland Tunnel — have decreased between 30% to 40% on average, particularly during the morning commute, according to the MTA’s data.</p><p>Bus speeds also increased after the tolls were turned on. The Manhattan-bound B39 bus, which crosses the Williamsburg Bridge, ran 28% faster compared to a similar January week last year. Other buses like the SIM24 and and the M50 saw increases in speeds, as well.</p><p>As for ridership on the MTA’s buses, Michaelson said that some express buses including the BM1, QM16, BM4 and SIM9 saw higher than average ridership growth last week, but did not specify by how much.</p><p>The same data shows that speeds traveling north and south on avenues in the toll zone south of 60th Street didn’t change significantly.</p><p>The MTA turned on the toll cameras on Jan. 5, charging most drivers a daytime $9 fee to enter the zone.</p><p>The MTA is using the revenue from the congestion pricing tolls to issue a $15 billion bond to buy new train cars, install accessible elevators at subway stations across the city and other transit infrastructure improvements.</p><p>Michaelson said the MTA has not looked at the total revenue generated from the tolls in the first week of the program. The MTA estimates it can collect $500 million through congestion pricing every year.</p><p>Congressional Republicans from New York have <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/we-will-get-it-done-ny-republicans-say-trump-agreed-to-help-kill-congestion-pricing" rel="noopener" target="_blank">vowed to kill the tolls</a> and said they have President-elect Donald Trump’s support.</p><p>But transit advocates said the first week of data showed congestion pricing is working.</p><p>"Drivers are saving tons of time. Buses are finally speeding up, especially express buses full of long distance commuters from across New York and New Jersey,” Riders Alliance spokesperson Danny Pearlstein wrote in a statement. "With such immediate success, politicians trying to end the program for personal gain must tell us why they want to lengthen millions of commutes, block tens of thousands of infrastructure jobs, and cut home values throughout the city and suburbs."</p><p><i>Stephen Nessen contributed reporting.</i></p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><article itemprop="text"><p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Campsite</h2><a id="user-content-campsite" aria-label="Permalink: Campsite" href="#campsite"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">This is an open source version of the <a href="https://www.campsite.com/" rel="nofollow">Campsite</a> app. This codebase is available <strong>as-is</strong> and is not actively maintained by the Campsite team. We will only consider pull requests and issues regarding self-hosting or critical fixes. The codebase is provided as a reference for those interested in learning how Campsite works. We welcome forks of this repository for use in non-commercial projects.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Local dev setup</h2><a id="user-content-local-dev-setup" aria-label="Permalink: Local dev setup" href="#local-dev-setup"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">To get started, run this command from the workspace root:</p>

<p dir="auto">Campsite requires setting up several services before you can run the basic version locally.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">S3 (critical)</h3><a id="user-content-s3-critical" aria-label="Permalink: S3 (critical)" href="#s3-critical"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">S3 is needed to upload avatars and attachments. We recommend separate buckets for dev and production. For example, we use <code>campsite-media</code> and <code>campsite-media-dev</code> buckets.</p>
<p dir="auto">You should setup a IAM user with <a href="https://github.com/campsite/campsite/blob/main/aws-policies.md">these suggested policies</a> (make sure to use your buckets in the policy).</p>
<p dir="auto">Set your credentials for the API:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="cd api
script/credentials development"><pre><span>cd</span> api
script/credentials development</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Configure these under the <code>aws</code> key.</p>
<p dir="auto">We also recommend uploading the contents of the <code>default_avatars</code> directory under <code>static/avatars</code> in each S3 bucket. <a href="https://github.com/campsite/campsite/blob/main/default_avatars/readme.md">Read more here</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Pusher (critical)</h3><a id="user-content-pusher-critical" aria-label="Permalink: Pusher (critical)" href="#pusher-critical"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://pusher.com/" rel="nofollow">Pusher</a> is used to send realtime updates and events. After creating your account, configure this under the <code>pusher</code> key in your credentials.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Imgix (critical)</h3><a id="user-content-imgix-critical" aria-label="Permalink: Imgix (critical)" href="#imgix-critical"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://www.imgix.com/" rel="nofollow">Imgix</a> is the CDN powering Campsite. On AWS IAM, you will need to create an imgix user + policy (<a href="https://github.com/campsite/campsite/blob/main/aws-policies.md">see recommended policy</a>).</p>
<p dir="auto">Then, add S3 as an <a href="https://docs.imgix.com/en-US/getting-started/setup/creating-sources/amazon-s3" rel="nofollow">Imgix source</a>. If you setup dev and prod S3 buckets, you will need a separate Imgix source for each.</p>
<p dir="auto">Lastly, create an API Key for Imgix in your account dropdown.</p>
<p dir="auto">Fill in all of these values in the credentials files:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>imgix.url</code> - The S3 sourced image domain. Should look like <a href="https://campsite-dev.imgix.net/" rel="nofollow">https://campsite-dev.imgix.net</a></li>
<li><code>imgix.source_id</code> - The Imgix source ID (top of the source page or in the URL)</li>
<li><code>imgix.api_key</code> - The API key you created</li>
<li><code>imgix_video.url</code> - Same URL as <code>imgix.url</code> but with <code>.video</code> as the TLD (e.g. <a href="https://campsite-dev.imgix.video/" rel="nofollow">https://campsite-dev.imgix.video</a>)</li>
</ul>
<div dir="auto"><p dir="auto">Note</p><p dir="auto">While here you can also setup <a href="https://docs.imgix.com/en-US/getting-started/setup/creating-sources/web-folder" rel="nofollow">Imgix Web Folders</a> and put the URL in <code>imgix_folder.url</code>. This is used to cache doc thumbnails, but isn't necessary on local dev. The web folder is needed to host doc thumbnails in prod.</p>
</div>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">100ms</h3><a id="user-content-100ms" aria-label="Permalink: 100ms" href="#100ms"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://www.100ms.live/" rel="nofollow">100ms</a> powers Campsite's video conferencing features. After creating an account, set these values under the <code>hms</code> credentials key.</p>
<div dir="auto"><p dir="auto">Note</p><p dir="auto">Video calls with webhooks will only work when using a secure tunnel such as ngrok.</p>
</div>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">OpenAI</h3><a id="user-content-openai" aria-label="Permalink: OpenAI" href="#openai"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">We use the OpenAI API to generate summaries for calls and posts. You need both an API key and your organization ID (not the name, found in OpenAI platform settings). Add these under the <code>openai</code> credentials key.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Others</h3><a id="user-content-others" aria-label="Permalink: Others" href="#others"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">There are many other services we use to power Campsite features. Create accounts and set up credentials as needed:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>aws_ecs</code> - run data exports on AWS Elastic Container Service</li>
<li><code>cal_dot_com</code> - the Campsite <a href="https://cal.com/" rel="nofollow">Cal.com</a> app</li>
<li><code>figma</code> - render frames via the <a href="https://www.figma.com/developers/api" rel="nofollow">Figma REST API</a></li>
<li><code>linear</code> - the Campsite Linear app (see <a href="https://developers.linear.app/docs" rel="nofollow">API docs</a>)</li>
<li><code>omniauth_google</code> - Google OAuth</li>
<li><code>plain</code> - customer feedback (likely not needed)</li>
<li><code>postmark</code> - sending emails via the <a href="https://postmarkapp.com/developer" rel="nofollow">Postmark API</a></li>
<li><code>sentry</code> - bug reports, just need the DSN</li>
<li><code>slack</code> - Campsite Slack app</li>
<li><code>vercel.revalidate_static_cache</code> - generate your own key to safely revalidate cached docs (ISR)</li>
<li><code>webpush_vapid</code> - VAPID keys necessary to send web push notifications (<a href="https://github.com/pushpad/web-push#generating-vapid-keys">docs</a>)</li>
<li><code>zapier</code> - The Campsite Zapier app</li>
<li><code>tenor</code> - GIF search (<a href="https://tenor.com/gifapi" rel="nofollow">docs</a>)</li>

<p>TL;DR – Introducing <code>voyage-code-3</code>, our next-generation embedding model optimized for code retrieval. It outperforms OpenAI-v3-large and CodeSage-large by an average of 13.80% and 16.81% on a suite of 32 code retrieval datasets, respectively. By supporting smaller dimensions with Matryoshka learning and quantized formats like int8 and binary, <code>voyage-code-3</code> can also dramatically reduce storage and search costs with minimal impact on retrieval quality.</p>



<p>Since its launch in Jan, <code>voyage-code-2</code> has been the most heavily used model with exponentially increasing adoption by code assistants and agents startups for their code retrieval. Today, we’re thrilled to announce <code>voyage-code-3</code>, which:</p>



<ul>
<li>outperforms OpenAI-v3-large and CodeSage-large by an average of 13.80% and 16.81% on a suite of 32 code retrieval datasets, respectively</li>



<li>supports embeddings of 2048, 1024, 512, and 256 dimensions</li>



<li>offers multiple embedding quantization, including <code>float</code> (32-bit floating point), <code>int8</code> (8-bit signed integer), <code>uint8</code> (8-bit unsigned integer), <code>binary</code> (bit-packed <code>int8</code>), and <code>ubinary</code> (bit-packed <code>uint8</code>)</li>



<li>supports a 32K-token context length, compared to OpenAI (8K) and CodeSage large (1K)</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="Matryoshka-Embeddings-and-Quantization">Matryoshka Embeddings and Quantization</h2>



<p>Storage and search costs in vector-based search can become significant for large corpora, such as in code retrieval with massive repositories. The costs scale linearly in the embedding dimensionality and precision (i.e., the number of bits used to encode each number). <code>voyage-code-3</code> supports much lower dimensional embeddings and binary and int8 quantization to dramatically lower the costs without losing much retrieval quality. These are enabled by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.13147" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Matryoshka learning</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.00758" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">quantization-aware training</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Matryoshka embeddings.</strong> Matryoshka learning creates embeddings with a nested family of embeddings with various lengths within a single vector. Concretely, for each of k in {256, 512, and 1024}, the first k entries of the 2048-dimensional embedding also form a valid k-dimensional embedding that is shorter with a slight loss of retrieval quality. Thus, the users can vectorize the documents into a long 2048-dimensional vector in advance and then later have the flexibility to use a shorter version of the embedding (by taking the first k entries) without re-invoking the embedding model.</p>



<p><strong>Quantization.</strong> Quantized embeddings have lower precision, represented with 8 bits or 1 bit per dimension, reducing 4x or 32x storage costs compared to 32-bit floats, respectively. <code>voyage-code-3</code> can return the embeddings with lower precision with various data types, <code>int8</code> (8-bit signed integer), <code>uint8</code> (8-bit unsigned integer), <code>binary</code> (bit-packed <code>int8</code>), and <code>ubinary</code> (bit-packed <code>uint8</code>). Most vector databases support storing and searching with quantized embeddings directly, including Milvus, Qdrant, Weaviate, Elasticsearch, and Vespa AI.</p>



<p><strong>Storage cost vs retrieval quality tradeoff.</strong> Quantization and shorter embeddings inevitably come with a reduced retrieval quality. Voyage focuses intently on this, striving to minimize the quality loss as much as possible. The following graph plots retrieval quality versus relative storage cost — showing a limited reduction of quality up to binary 1024-dimensional embeddings compared to the float32 2048-dimensional embeddings.</p>

<p>All green data points above the green line represent <code>voyage-code-3</code>, and those below are uniquely colored per model and explicitly labeled with quantization and dimension. Lines connecting data points represent the same model and data type but at different embedding dimensions. The evaluation results used to generate this plot are available in&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Q5GDXOXueHuBT9demPrL9bz3_LMgajcZs_-GPeawrYk/edit?gid=105010523#gid=105010523" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">this spreadsheet</a>.</p>



<h2>Optimized for Code Retrieval</h2>



<p>Code retrieval presents unique challenges compared to general text retrieval due to the need for algorithmic reasoning and the nuanced syntax rules such as keywords, control structures, nesting, and formatting. These challenges are further complicated by several retrieval subtasks, including text-to-code (e.g., retrieve code snippets using natural language queries), code-to-code (e.g., identify semantically similar code snippets), and docstring-to-code (e.g., retrieve code snippets using function docstring queries).</p>



<p><strong>Curated, massive code training data.</strong> We curated a larger, more diverse, high-quality code corpus for training <code>voyage-code-3</code> than <code>voyage-code-2</code>. First, we assembled a broad corpus with trillions of tokens comprising text, code, and mathematical content with a carefully tuned code-to-text ratio. Next, we developed a comprehensive dataset with positive pairs for contrastive learning based on public GitHub repositories, containing docstring-code and code-code pairs across 300+ programming languages. This dataset was combined with the general text pair dataset used to train our leading general-purpose <code>voyage-3</code> model. Finally, we collected additional real-world query-code pairs, covering a wide range of tasks in code assistant use cases, to ensure robust coverage of real-world scenarios.</p>



<p><strong>Evaluation.</strong> We evaluated <code>voyage-code-3</code> using an enhanced suite of evaluation datasets designed to address the shortcomings of existing benchmarks and deliver practical, robust results. Existing datasets can suffer from noisy labels, overly simplistic tasks, and data contamination risks, making them ill-suited for real-world applications. For instance, the original CoSQA dataset was found to have <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11589" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">51%</a> of its queries paired with mismatched code. Our evaluation incorporated diverse tasks, such as text-to-code and code-to-code, repurposed question-answer datasets for retrieval, and introduced complex, real-world repositories and scenarios that challenge embedding models to achieve deeper understanding.

<h2>Evaluation Details</h2>



<p><strong>Datasets.</strong> We evaluate <code>voyage-code-3</code> across 32 datasets spanning five categories that cover various code retrieval tasks, real-world use cases, and challenging code scenarios. These datasets are discussed in length in our code retrieval evaluation blog <a href="https://blog.voyageai.com/2024/12/04/code-retrieval-eval/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>. The table below summarizes the key datasets.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p>Spain has announced plans to impose a tax of up to 100% on real estate bought by non-residents from countries outside the EU, such as the UK, in an aim to tackle the country’s housing crisis.</p><p>The measure was one of a dozen unveiled on Monday by the country’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, as the government seeks to quell <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/mar/30/a-family-used-to-live-here-the-spanish-sticker-rebellion-battling-tourist-lets" data-link-name="in body link">mounting anger</a> over housing costs that have soared far beyond the reach of many in Spain.</p><p>Sánchez sought to underline the global nature of the challenge, citing housing prices that had swelled 48% in the past decade across <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Europe</a>, far outpacing household incomes.</p><p>“The west faces a decisive challenge: to not become a society divided into two classes, the rich landlords and poor tenants,” he told an economic forum in Madrid.</p><p>The proposed measures include expanding the supply of social housing, offering incentives to those who renovate and rent out empty properties at affordable prices and cracking down on seasonal rentals. In Spain just 2.5% of housing is set aside for social housing, a figure that lags drastically behind countries such as France and the Netherlands, said Sánchez.</p><p>But it was the government’s plans to crackdown on foreign, non-EU buyers that grabbed headlines around the world. Spain has long been a popular destination for non-EU holiday home buyers, with residents of the UK, US and Morocco flocking to buy properties in places such as Ibiza, Marbella and Barcelona.</p><p>Sánchez described the tax of up to 100% as “unprecedented” in Spanish history. “Just to give an idea, in 2023 alone non-European Union residents bought around 27,000 houses and flats in Spain. And they didn’t do it to live in them, they didn’t do it for their families to have a place to live, they did it to speculate, to make money from them, which we – in the context of shortage that we are in – obviously cannot allow.”</p><p>He did not offer more details on how the plan would work or when it would be finalised and sent to parliament for approval. Given his government’s longstanding struggles to pass legislation, one analyst suggested to <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/8e2e9f04-1606-4d2d-8b9c-0094b1cef038" data-link-name="in body link">the Financial Times</a> that the government’s aim was to deter foreign property investors by creating “uncertainty and noise” with a proposal that has slim chances of becoming law.</p><p>The government’s slate of measures also took aim at tourist flats, which have long <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/19/barcelona-mayor-defends-ban-tourist-flats-drastic-action-needed-cut-housing-costs" data-link-name="in body link">been blamed</a> for shrinking the rental supply and leaving locals priced out of the market.</p><p>Sánchez said regulations on these rentals would be tightened while the taxes they pay would be hiked. “It is not fair that those who own three, four, five apartments for short-term rental pay less tax than hotels,” said Sánchez.</p><figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement"><a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-10">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p id="EmailSignup-skip-link-10" tabindex="0" aria-label="after newsletter promotion" role="note">after newsletter promotion</p></figure><p>He argued that the measures were necessary to tackle what he described as an “unbearable” mismatch between rising housing prices and household incomes.</p><p>“We are facing a serious problem, with enormous social and economic implications, which requires a decisive response from society as a whole, with public institutions at the forefront,” he added.</p></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://sourcecodered.com/snyk-malicious-npm-package/">https://sourcecodered.com/snyk-malicious-npm-package/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42690473">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>You can see in the screenshot that the data is then exfiltrated to a website that the attacker owns.</p>
<p>Now, typically, when we see packages like this, they are attempting to perform a dependency confusion attack on a specific company.&nbsp; I don’t know if Cursor.com has a bug bounty program or a specific background. Still, I would suspect that Cursor has several NPM private packages named “cursor-always-local”, “cursor-retrieval”, and “cursor-shadow-workspace”.&nbsp; The person who created these packages is probably hoping that Cursor employees accidentally install these public packages, which will send their data to the attacker-controlled web service.</p>
<p>Luckily, in addition to me seeing these files, the OpenSSF package analysis scanner identified these packages as malicious.&nbsp; OSV generated 3 malware advisories:&nbsp; MAL-2025-27, MAL-2025-28 and MAL-2025-29.&nbsp; You can see the malware advisories here:&nbsp; <a href="https://osv.dev/list?q=cursor&amp;ecosystem=npm">https://osv.dev/list?q=cursor&amp;ecosystem=npm</a></p>
<h2><strong>Who deployed these malicious packages?</strong></h2>
<p>Okay, we know what the packages do when installing them, and we think they target <a href="https://cursor.com/">Cursor.com</a>.&nbsp; Who would do this?&nbsp; Well, the answer is in the NPM package metadata.</p>
<p>The user who published the NPM package uses a snyk.io email address for the Snyk Security Labs team.&nbsp; This part of the metadata cannot be faked.&nbsp; The author field in the metadata specifically mentions an employee at Snyk.&nbsp; This part of the NPM package metadata can be faked, but since the publisher is a verified Snyk email, my guess is that this genuinely came from Snyk.</p>
