<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>Last week, the developer community was busy discussing about a single tweet:</p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I'm not joking and this isn't funny. We have been trying to build distributed agent orchestrators at Google since last year. There are various options, not everyone is aligned... I gave Claude Code a description of the problem, it generated what we built last year in an hour.</p>— Jaana Dogan ヤナ ドガン (@rakyll) <a href="https://twitter.com/rakyll/status/2007239758158975130?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 2, 2026</a></blockquote>



<p>The author is Jaana Dogan (known as <a href="https://github.com/rakyll">Rakyll</a>), a highly respected figure in the Google ecosystem, in the open-source world, and in my heart (thank you Rakyll for your great <a href="https://rakyll.org/">Go blog posts</a>).</p>
<p>At first glance, the tweet suggests an enormous shift in the software industry: the ability to build <strong>in just one hour</strong> what previously required weeks or months for a team of sofware engineers, using <strong>just</strong> the description of the problem. The tweet was too-much dramatic in my own opinion, but actually impressive!</p>
<p>The post triggered an immediate wave of “doom-posting,” with many fearing for the future of software engineering (as each week since a year now).
However, as the conversation reached a high number of replies and citations on social networks, Rakyll released a follow-up thread to provide context:</p>
<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>To cut through the noise on this topic, it’s helpful to provide more more context:</p><p>- We have built several versions of this system last year. - There are tradeoffs and there hasn't been a clear winner.<br>- When prompted with the best ideas that survived, coding agents are able to… <a href="https://t.co/k5FvAah7yc">https://t.co/k5FvAah7yc</a></p></div>— Jaana Dogan ヤナ ドガン (@rakyll) <a href="https://twitter.com/rakyll/status/2007659740126761033?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 4, 2026</a></blockquote>



<p>This response thread revealed a story <strong>far less miraculous</strong> than the original tweet suggested.
Let’s analyze it.</p>
<p>Crucially, <strong>the foundational “thinking” had already been performed by Rakyll herself</strong>, who guided the AI using architectural concepts (honed over several weeks or months of prior effort) rather than the AI thinking and inventing the “product” from scratch.<br>
Furthermore, <strong>the resulting project was strictly a proof-of-concept</strong> that falls far short of a production-ready system capable of managing real-world complexity.<br>
And finally, this success hinged on the Rakyll’s <strong>implicit domain knowledge and deep expertise</strong>. The last point is often (strategically?) omitted from these “magic” viral demonstrations in order to make the tool appear way more autonomous than it truly is.</p>
<p>Hmm. Now, this is far less exciting…</p>
<h2 id="under-influence">
  Under influence
  <a href="#under-influence">#</a>
</h2>
<p>This pattern of “<em>hype first and context later</em>” is actually part of a growing trend.</p>
<p>I call the individuals participating to that trend “<strong>The Influentists</strong>”.
Those people are members of a scientific or technical community, and leverage their large audiences to propagate claims that are, at best, unproven and, at worst, <em>intentionally</em> misleading.</p>
<p>But how can we spot them?</p>
<p>I personally identify these “Influentists” by four personality traits that characterize their public discourse.<br>
The first is a reliance on <strong>"<em>trust-me-bro</em>" culture</strong>, where anecdotal experiences are framed as universal, objective truths to generate hype. This is a sentiment perfectly captured by the <em>“I’m not joking and this isn’t funny”</em> tone of Rakyll’s original tweet, but also the dramatic <em>“I’ve never felt that much behind as a programmer”</em> from Andrej Karpathy’s tweet.
This is supported by an <strong>absence of reproducible proof</strong>, as these individuals rarely share the code, data, or methodology behind their viral “wins”, an omission made easier than ever in the current LLM era.
And finally, they utilize <strong>strategic ambiguity</strong>, carefully wording their claims with enough vagueness to pivot toward a “clarification” if the technical community challenges their accuracy.</p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I've never felt this much behind as a programmer. The profession is being dramatically refactored as the bits contributed by the programmer are increasingly sparse and between. I have a sense that I could be 10X more powerful if I just properly string together what has become…</p>— Andrej Karpathy (@karpathy) <a href="https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/2004607146781278521?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 26, 2025</a></blockquote>

</h2>
<p>Rakyll is far from alone. We see this “hype-first” approach across major AI firms like Anthropic, OpenAI, or Microsoft.</p>
<p>Consider Galen Hunt, a Distinguished Engineer at Microsoft. He recently made waves by claiming a goal to rewrite Microsoft’s massive C/C++ codebases into Rust by 2030 using AI.</p>

<p>When the industry pointed out the near-impossible complexity of this task, but also asking clarity for popular and critical products like Microsoft Windows, he was forced to clarify that it was only a “research project”.</p>

<p>Similarly, engineers from Anthropic and OpenAI oftenly post teasers about “AGI being achieved internally” to release months later models that disappoint the crowd.</p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Wait, can we consider seriously the hypothesis that 1) the recent hyped tweets from OA's staff <br>2) "AGI has been achieved internally" <br>3) sama's comments on the qualification of slow or fast takeoff hinging on the date you count from <br>4) sama's comments on 10000x researchers <br>are… <a href="https://t.co/f57g7dXMhM">https://t.co/f57g7dXMhM</a> <a href="https://t.co/Gap3V7VqkK">pic.twitter.com/Gap3V7VqkK</a></p>— Siméon (@Simeon_Cps) <a href="https://twitter.com/Simeon_Cps/status/1706078819617063304?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 24, 2023</a></blockquote>



<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Liam, I have been a professional programmer for 36 years. I spent 11 years at Google, where I ended up as a Staff Software Engineer, and now work at Anthropic.

<p>Similarly, many other companies lie over what they are solving or willing to solve:</p>

</h2>
<p>When leaders at major labs propagate these hyped-based results, it can create a “technical debt of expectations” for the rest of us.
Junior developers see these viral threads and feel they are failing because they can’t reproduce a year of work in an hour, not realizing the “magic” was actually a highly-curated prototype guided by a decade of hidden expertise.</p>
<p>We must stop granting automatic authority to those who rely on hype, or vibes, rather than evidence.<br>
If a tool or methodology were truly as revolutionary as claimed, then it wouldn’t need a viral thread to prove its worth
because <strong>the results would speak for themselves</strong>.</p>
<p>The tech community must shift its admiration back toward <strong>reproducible results</strong> and away from this “<em>trust-me-bro</em>” culture.</p>

<p>Wind power is consolidating its position as one of the pillars of the energy and economic system in Spain, although it is going through a key moment marked by regulatory blockages that threaten its development. This renewable energy source is set to become the leading technology in the electricity mix, with a production of 59,378 GW and a coverage of 24% of demand, according to the macroeconomic study of the impact of the wind energy sector in Spain 2024, prepared by Deloitte and presented by the Spanish wind energy association (AEE).</p>
<p>The sector contributed 0.25% to GDP and enabled savings on consumers' electricity bills of more than 4.6 billion euros in 2024, with an average reduction in the wholesale price of close to 20 euros per MWh. Between 2012 and 2024, the accumulated savings exceed 47.4 billion, according to the study. The sector also employed 37,070 people, 4.7% more than the previous year, with high value-added jobs and a clear industrial vocation in regions such as Galicia, the Basque Country and Andalucía. Spain is also the world's fourth largest exporter of wind turbines, behind only China, Denmark and Germany, with exports valued at 1.95 billion euros, which are growing steadily year after year.</p>

<p>However, in the eyes of the sector, if Spain does not unblock regulatory bottlenecks, provide legal certainty for projects and accelerate electrification, "Spain will lose a historic opportunity for reindustrialisation and progress", director general of AEE Juan Virgilio Márquez warns. According to the sector, one of the main immediate challenges is to accelerate the electrification of the economy and increase electricity demand to prevent zero or negative prices from perpetuating in the market, which conditions investment decisions.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that the installed capacity reached 31,679 MW in 2024, after adding 1,185 MW, the sector warns that the current pace is insufficient to meet the objectives of the national integrated energy and climate plan (PNIEC). "The reason is that the administrative process is very complex. Different criteria are applied in different parts of Spain and even between individual projects. This is slowing down the pace necessary for the natural growth demanded by the industry," Márquez says.</p>

<p>Spain should be installing around four gigawatts of wind energy per year, but barely reaches one gigawatt per year. In his opinion, it is essential to coherently apply the principle of the higher public interest of renewables, which is included in European legislation but not yet fully adopted into Spanish law, in order to provide security and stability to the development of new projects.</p>
<p>The reality is that projects or industrial capacity are not lacking, but administrative and judicial obstacles make it almost impossible to meet the forecasts for 2030. More than ten gigawatts have administrative authorisation for construction, although some three gigawatts remain paralysed in Galicia. Added to this are 9.2 GW with a favourable environmental declaration pending authorisation and more than 17,000 MW blocked since 2018, mostly due to unfavourable environmental reports. According to the sector, for every megawatt installed in recent years, four have not been developed. It calls for the effective application of the European principle of overriding public interest in renewables to unblock projects and provide regulatory stability.</p>
<p>
<h3>
Repowering, security of supply and offshore wind
</h3>
</p>
<p>Another major strategic vector is the repowering of existing wind farms. Spain has more than ten gigawatts that are more than 20 years old and nearly three gigawatts that are more than 25 years old - installations located in areas that are already anthropised, with a known resource and consolidated social endorsement. However, current regulatory and environmental constraints mean that, in some cases, repowering a wind farm may even mean a loss of power. The sector is calling for a clear roadmap, with incentives, improvements in grid access and regulatory security that will allow business decisions to be anticipated and to make the most of this potential. In particular, the situation in Galicia is of concern, where paralysed projects imply not only a brake on the energy transition, but also the loss of industrial and employment opportunities. The AEE estimates that the current blockage jeopardises the creation of some 4,000 jobs.</p>
<p>At the same time, the sector is calling for enhancing the security of the electricity system through the effective activation of the technical regulations necessary for renewables to provide stability services, such as voltage control, grid forming or the damping of oscillations. Although companies are willing to be authorised to provide these services, they warn of the costs, regulatory risks and the need for clear and coordinated planning with the system operator to avoid distortions.</p>
<p>Offshore wind is set to become a long-term industrial sector, but the ministerial order for the first pilot auction of this type of wind is still pending development. According to AEE, even with a first auction in 2026, the first wind farms would not be operational until 2033. Delaying this first step would mean giving up the creation of more than 4,000 jobs associated with the first gigawatt and losing ground to countries such as France, Norway, the UK and the Netherlands, which are already moving forward with defined policies and auctions. Márquez insists on the need to activate an initial market that allows the Spanish industry to position itself from the outset in the global offshore wind value chain.</p>
<p>All of this takes place in a context of high tax pressure. The sector suffers a tax impact of close to 600 million euros per year, mainly derived from the 7% tax on the value of electricity production, the temporary energy levy and specific figures such as the wind tax in Aragon. According to AEE calculations, for every 1,000 euros of income, 224 euros are spent on taxes and levies - a burden that far exceeds expenditure on personnel and which penalises new investment.</p>

When operating on a malformed PDF (ends .pdf, but it is really a text file with a few sentences in it), after trying to read it once, Claude starts throwing an API error in every subsequent chat in the conversation.</p><p><img alt="Attempting to read a file with the wrong extension provokes repeated API errors." width="2108" height="1322" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/5Wt3USKsw3SnUb4PXtqqVkmBU.png" srcset="https://framerusercontent.com/images/5Wt3USKsw3SnUb4PXtqqVkmBU.png?scale-down-to=512&amp;width=4217&amp;height=2644 512w,https://framerusercontent.com/images/5Wt3USKsw3SnUb4PXtqqVkmBU.png?scale-down-to=1024&amp;width=4217&amp;height=2644 1024w,https://framerusercontent.com/images/5Wt3USKsw3SnUb4PXtqqVkmBU.png?scale-down-to=2048&amp;width=4217&amp;height=2644 2048w,https://framerusercontent.com/images/5Wt3USKsw3SnUb4PXtqqVkmBU.png?scale-down-to=4096&amp;width=4217&amp;height=2644 4096w,https://framerusercontent.com/images/5Wt3USKsw3SnUb4PXtqqVkmBU.png?width=4217&amp;height=2644 4217w" data-framer-original-sizes="" sizes="(min-width: 1080px) 100vw, (min-width: 810px) and (max-width: 1079.98px) 100vw, (max-width: 809.98px) 100vw"></p><p>We posit that it is likely possible to exploit this failure via indirect prompt injection to cause a limited denial of service attack (e.g., an injection can elicit Claude to create a malformed file, and then read it). Uploading the malformed file via the files API resulted in notifications with an error message, both in the Claude client and the Anthropic Console.</p><h3 id="agentic-blast-radius"><a href="#agentic-blast-radius">Agentic Blast Radius</a></h3><div><p>One of the key capabilities that Cowork was created for is the ability to interact with one's entire day-to-day work environment. This includes the browser and MCP servers, granting capabilities like sending texts, controlling one's Mac with AppleScripts, etc. </p><p>These functionalities make it increasingly likely that the model will process both sensitive and untrusted data sources (which the user does not review manually for injections), making prompt injection an ever-growing attack surface. We urge users to exercise caution when configuring Connectors. Though this article demonstrated an exploit without leveraging Connectors, we believe they represent a major risk surface likely to impact everyday users.</p></div></div></div>]]></description>

age be 16, as in Australia, or should it be 15, as might become the case in </span><a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/en/pixels/article/2026/01/02/ban-on-social-media-for-under-15s-what-we-know-about-the-government-s-plan_6749022_13.html" rel="">France</a><span>?</span></strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Should there be an option for parents to give consent for adolescents below that age?</strong></p></li></ol><p><strong>The correct answers: </strong><em><strong>16, and no.</strong></em></p><p><strong>Here’s why:</strong></p><p><span>I devoted an entire chapter of </span><em>The Anxious Generation</em><span> to puberty because it is such a crucial period of brain re-wiring and </span><a href="https://anthrosource.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1525/eth.1992.20.3.02a00030" rel="">identity formation</a><span>. Developmental psychologists see puberty as a “</span><a href="https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/abstract/S1364-6613(15)00172-2" rel="">sensitive period</a><span>” in which the brain is especially “plastic” or malleable based on incoming experience. The brain is changing over from the child form to the adult form, and those changes are guided by whatever a child does repeatedly. Neurons that fire together wire together, as brain researchers say.</span></p><p><span>The average adolescent in the U.S. now spends around </span><a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/512576/teens-spend-average-hours-social-media-per-day.aspx" rel="">five hours a day</a><span> using social media. Their brains will enhance whichever neurons and circuits are activated repeatedly, at the expense of neurons and circuits that are underused. This brain sculpting happens throughout childhood, and continues on in the pre-frontal cortex until around age 25. But in the earlier part of adolescence — specifically puberty — the sculpting is more intense, and the changes are more likely to be permanent.</span></p><p><span>The age range of puberty varies across cultures and historical eras, but in modern developed nations it </span><a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/puberty" rel="">generally</a><span> </span><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ppe.12507" rel="">begins</a><span> between ages 8–13 for girls and a year or two later for boys. By almost any measure, the median boy and the median girl are still in puberty on their 15th birthday. Most are still getting </span><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7983983/" rel="">taller</a><span>. Their secondary sex characteristics are still changing. Large population studies of </span><a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article-abstract/110/5/911/64524/National-Estimates-of-the-Timing-of-Sexual" rel="">American</a><span> and </span><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ppe.12507" rel="">European</a><span> teens show that the median girl reaches Tanner stage 5 (the last stage of genital development) between 15 and 16, while the median boy reaches stage 5 around 16 or 17. There is wide variation for both sexes. The ability to self-regulate </span><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6473801/" rel="">improves steadily throughout adolescence</a><span>, only reaching a plateau in the mid 20s.</span></p><p><span>In other words: Half or more of all girls are still in puberty on their 15th birthday, and half or more of all boys are still in puberty on their 16th birthday. This is a major reason why 16 is a much better choice for a minimum age than 15. (Of course, 18 would be even better than 16, but we nominated 16 as the norm in </span><em>The Anxious Generation</em><span> because our goal was to pick the highest age that we thought could actually get enacted across many jurisdictions.)</span></p><p>Puberty is the period when parents should be most careful about how their children spend their time and who (or what) is influencing their developing brains and identities. Traditionally, human societies helped children make the jump from child to adult during this crucial period, with rites of passage in which trusted, non-parental adults guided them through challenges, hardships, and lessons.</p><p><span>But what do we do in Western nations? We generally mark the beginning of puberty by giving kids smartphones (average age in the U.S. </span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2025/10/08/how-parents-manage-screen-time-for-kids/" rel="">is around</a><span> </span><a href="https://sapienlabs.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Smartphones-and-Mind-Health-final.pdf" rel="">11 or 12</a><span>). We then outsource their social and neural development to Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube. The results </span><a href="https://www.anxiousgeneration.com/research/the-evidence" rel="">have been catastrophic</a><span> for their mental health, social relationships, education, and ability to focus for more than a few minutes.</span></p><p><span>So does it matter whether the age cutoff is 15, rather than 16? Yes. Puberty is the time when social media is likely to do the most damage, and most adolescents, including the large majority of boys, are still in puberty at 15. A 2022 paper by </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-29296-3" rel="">Orben and her colleagues</a><span> even found that there was a peak “developmental window of sensitivity to social media,” such that heavy use by boys at ages 14 and 15 most strongly predicted decreased life satisfaction a year later. (For girls the peak sensitivity was ages 11 through 13).</span></p><p>Sixteen may feel like a more obvious or natural choice for the age of “digital adulthood” in the U.S. because the minimum age for a driver’s license is 16 in most states, (though it is higher in most other countries). Similarly, people in some European countries may see 15 as an obvious or natural choice because that is the age of consent in some countries, the age at which adolescents can legally engage in sexual activity.</p><p>But the fact remains: Any nation that sets 15 as the minimum age rather than 16 will condemn its children to an extra year of brain-sculpting by social media at a time when their brains are still highly sculptable. It will also greatly increase the risk of exposure to pornography, sextortion, online cruelty, and other risky interactions with anonymous strangers at an age when teens have less ability to self-regulate or know what is safe.</p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.afterbabel.com/p/why-every-country-should-set-16?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://www.afterbabel.com/p/why-every-country-should-set-16?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p><p><span>Parents everywhere have heard their children invoke the mantra “but everyone else has one! I’m being left out!” in their daily struggles over smartphones, tablets, social media, video games, and other screen-based activities. And the kids are largely correct. Now that almost everyone else has one, everyone feels that they, too, have to have one. That’s a perfect example of what economists call a </span><a href="https://bfi.uchicago.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/BFI_WP_2023-131.pdf" rel="">collective action trap</a><span>, where everyone ends up doing something sub-optimal because if they were the only one to choose the better action, they’d actually end up even worse off.</span></p><p>The way to escape from a collective action trap is collectively. If most families only give basic phones before age 14, then no 13-year-old can say “but I’m the only one who doesn’t have an iPhone!” If most families wait until 16 before allowing their kids to open social media accounts, that would also reduce the pressure on everyone younger than that to open a social media account.</p><p>But while parents can choose the age at which their child gets a phone, no parent has full control over when their child opens social media accounts. If the child can get to the internet anywhere, including at school, she can open as many accounts as she likes as long as she’s old enough to say she’s 13.</p><p>This is why parents need help from their governments, and from the platforms (which have shown repeatedly that they will not protect children unless forced to by law). This is why the Australian law is so important: It delays the struggle over social media until the age of 16.</p><p><span>Any country that adds in a provision for parental consent at younger ages plunges everyone back into the collective action trap. We’re right back to “But all of my friends’ parents gave </span><em>them</em><span> permission!”</span><span data-state="closed"><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1-184377434" href="https://www.afterbabel.com/p/why-every-country-should-set-16#footnote-1-184377434" target="_self" rel="">1</a></span></p><p><span>A third consideration is that simple rules are generally best for a complex world, as legal scholars </span><a href="https://www.hup.harvard.edu/books/9780674808218" rel="">Richard Epstein</a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/83456/the-death-of-common-sense-by-philip-k-howard/" rel="">Philip Howard</a><span> have long argued. People understand and remember them. They are easier to enforce. And for social media — by its nature international and placeless — a patchwork quilt of different age and parental-permission rules means that underage kids could (and many will) use a VPN to find a country in which they can easily open a social media account.</span></p><p>As a bonus, a simple and widespread age limit of 16 would be much easier for social media platforms to enforce effectively. They don’t want different rules across different countries. If we make things easy for them, they’ll be more effective at enforcing the law.</p><p><span>As an additional bonus, large majorities of parents, and adults more broadly, say in surveys that they support laws that set an age limit for opening social media accounts.

The model provided clarity about the choices to be made. Phone-free school policies have been widely </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rfPGAxYc-fx9Z6OF2fmhmovpWg0sISb-N0XNq_BDzfY/edit?tab=t.0" rel="">successful</a><span> across many jurisdictions.</span></p><p>So, as countries and states consider following Australia’s lead in 2026, we want to offer a similar set of features for an ideal social media age-limit policy. </p><p><span>As discussed previously, protecting children during puberty is essential. Social media is wildly inappropriate for children and younger adolescents. </span><a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nmd.496039/gov.uscourts.nmd.496039.36.2.pdf" rel="">One internal Instagram study found that</a><span> 11% of 13-15 year olds reported being a target of bullying, 13% reported receiving an unwanted sexual advance, 19% reported seeing unwanted sexually explicit content, and 21% reported seeing posts that made them feel worse about themselves </span><strong>every seven days</strong><span>. In a </span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2025/04/22/teens-social-media-and-mental-health/" rel="">recent Pew poll</a><span>, 45% of teens reported that they themselves felt they used social media too much with many suggesting that it affects their sleep and their grades. Fifteen is too young. It also undercuts the power of the norm in countries that set it to 16.</span></p><p>Don’t make parents’ jobs even harder by giving their kids one more thing to beg for. Setting a single, clear age minimum with no loopholes does parents a favor. Imagine if every child could plead with their parents to get a drivers license at any age. Governments routinely set minimum ages for products and activities that could harm or exploit children, such as driving a car, signing up for a credit card, or drinking alcohol — social media is no different. Keep the policy simple and uniform for everyone and make parenting a little bit easier for us all.</p><p><span>Setting age-limit policies based on content (what kinds of things kids see) prompts never-ending debates about what content is inappropriate for children (e.g., what counts as too sexually explicit, how violent is too violent?, etc.). It can also lead to charges of content-based or viewpoint-based censorship. This is why we recommend orienting the law not around content but around the age at which minors can sign contracts with companies in which they agree to give away personal data and expose themselves fully to the company’s addictive algorithms, without their parents’ knowledge or consent. We think it is important to allow logged-off access to content, as </span><a href="https://www.afterbabel.com/p/australia-social-meda-minimum-age-misunderstood" rel="">Australia’s policy does</a><span>. Children under 16 can still search sites such as YouTube for whatever content they want. They can easily view any video that a teacher assigns or a friend recommends. But if they do not have an account and have not signed a contract with the company, then they cannot compare the popularity of pictures of themselves, receive tailored late night notifications, be served more and more extreme content, or be contacted by strangers via messaging. Without this inappropriate business relationship and access to the extensive data they currently collect from kids, companies will find it much harder to train algorithms and use design features to manipulate and exploit kids.</span></p><p><span>While several platforms are currently the obvious targets of legislation because of the outsized role they play in kids’ lives, any definition of “social media” will inevitably invite challenges by companies who host different activities and have varied feature sets. By focusing on </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GVO7sNuCNmNwqVK64PHQI7wxd8-Gmr9PqdkW12elmus/edit?gid=941162555#gid=941162555" rel="">the design features</a><span> that cause harm, we can capture video-game platforms that facilitate adult/minor solicitation and video-hosting platforms that maximize engagement through algorithms. Platforms that do not need these potentially harmful features will want to avoid the increased regulation and risk, and will therefore have an incentive to keep them out.</span></p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.afterbabel.com/p/why-every-country-should-set-16?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://www.afterbabel.com/p/why-every-country-should-set-16?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p><p><span>We would love to take credit for the success of phone-free school policies, and for the growing international interest in social media age-limit policies. The reality is, though, that these policies and ideas succeed because they address something that most parents, teachers, and children experience every day: the technology-facilitated manipulation of one of our most precious resources — the time and attention of our kids. Policymakers, parents, and kids themselves are fighting back. In fact, on the </span><em>New York Times</em><span> tech podcast </span><em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/12/podcasts/hardfork-australia-water.html" rel="">Hard Fork</a></em><span>, co-host Casey Newton offered his number-one prediction for a 2026 tech trend:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>Sixteen plus becomes the new norm for social media accounts worldwide… by the end of 2026 we’ve seen at least five other democracies introduce similar rules.</em></p></blockquote><p>Bravo to Australia, and bravo to the five (or more) countries that will turn Australia’s bold move into a new international standard. Let’s make 16+ the standard around the globe.</p></div></div>]]></description>

There are some systems that use fancy cryptography so that a digital ID saved to your device won’t tell the website anything more than if you meet the age requirement, but access to that digital ID isn’t available to everyone or for all platforms. You may also not want to register for a digital ID and save it to your phone, if you don’t want to </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/08/digital-identification-must-be-designed-privacy-and-equity-10"><span>take the chance</span></a><span> of all the information on it being exposed upon request of an over-zealous verifier, or you simply don’t want to be a part of a digital ID system</span></p>
<p><span>If you’re given the option of selecting a verification method and are deciding which to use, we recommend considering the following questions for each process allowed by each vendor:</span></p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Data:</b><span> What info does each method require?</span></li>
<li><b>Access: </b><span>Who can see the data during the course of the verification process?</span></li>
<li><b>Retention:</b><span> Who will hold onto that data after the verification process, and for how long?</span></li>
<li><b>Audits: </b>How sure are we that the stated claims will happen in practice? For example, are there external audits confirming that data is not accidentally leaked to another site along the way? Ideally these will be in-depth, security-focused audits by specialized auditors like <a href="https://www.nccgroup.com/technical-assurance/">NCC Group</a> or <a href="https://www.trailofbits.com/services/software-assurance/">Trail of Bits</a>, instead of audits that merely certify adherence to standards.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Visibility:</strong> <span>Who will be aware that you’re attempting to verify your age, and will they know which platform you’re trying to verify for?</span></li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p><span>We attempt to provide answers to these questions below. To begin, there are two major factors to consider when answering these questions: the tools each platform uses, and the overall system those tools are part of.</span></p>
<p><span>In general, most platforms offer </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/10/age-verification-estimation-assurance-oh-my-guide-terminology"><b>age estimation</b></a><b> options like </b><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/01/face-scans-estimate-our-age-creepy-af-and-harmful"><b>face scans</b></a><span> as a first line of age assurance. These vary in intrusiveness, but their main problem is inaccuracy, particularly for marginalized users. Third-party age verification vendors </span><a href="https://docs.privateid.com/age"><span>Private ID</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.k-id.com/facial-age-estimation"><span>k-ID</span></a><span> offer on-device facial age estimation, but another common vendor, </span><a href="https://www.yoti.com/blog/facial-age-estimation-faq-frequently-asked-questions/"><span>Yoti</span></a><span>, sends the image to their servers during age checks by some of the biggest platforms. This risks leaking the images themselves, and also the fact that you’re using that particular website, to the third party.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Then, there’s the </span><b>document-based verification services</b><span>, which require you to submit a hard identifier like a government-issued ID. This method thus requires you to prove both your age and your identity. A platform can do this in-house through a designated dataflow, or by sending that data to a third party. We’ve already seen examples of how this can fail. For example, Discord routed users' ID data through its general customer service workflow so that a third-party vendor could perform manual review of verification appeals. No one involved ever deleted users' data, so when the system was breached, Discord had to apologize for the catastrophic disclosure of </span><a href="https://www.404media.co/the-discord-hack-is-every-users-worst-nightmare/"><span>nearly 70,000 photos</span></a><span> of users' ID documents. Overly long retention periods expose documents to risk of breaches and historical data requests. Some document verifiers have retention periods that are needlessly long. This is the case with </span><a href="https://incode.com/privacy-policy/#data-security"><span>Incode</span></a><span>, which provides ID verification for Tiktok. Incode holds onto images forever by default, though TikTok should&nbsp;</span><a href="https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/account-and-user-safety/minimum-age-appeals-on-tiktok"><span>automatically</span></a> <a href="https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/account-and-user-safety/underage-appeals-on-tiktok"><span>start</span></a><span> the deletion process on your behalf.</span></p>
<p><span>Some platforms offer alternatives, like proving that you own a </span><a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/10071085#zippy=%2Cuse-a-credit-card-for-age-verification"><span>credit card</span></a><span>, or asking for your </span><a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/10071085#zippy=%2Cuse-a-credit-card-for-age-verification%2Cuse-an-email-address-for-age-verification"><span>email</span></a><span> to check if it appears in databases associated with adulthood (like home mortgage databases). These tend to involve less risk when it comes to the sensitivity of the data itself, especially since credit cards can be replaced, but in general still undermine anonymity and pseudonymity and pose a risk of tracking your online activity. We’d prefer to see more assurances across the board about how information is handled.</span></p>
<p><span>Each site offers users a menu of age assurance options to choose from. We’ve chosen to present these options in the rough order that we expect most people to prefer. Jump directly to a platform to learn more about its age checks:</span></p>

</ul>
<h2><span><a id="Meta"></a>Meta – Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger, Threads</span></h2>
<h3><span>Inferred Age</span></h3>
<p><b>If Meta can guess your age, you may never even see an age verification screen.</b><span> Meta, which runs Facebook, Threads, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp, first tries to use information you’ve posted to guess your age, like </span><a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/07/age-verification/"><span>looking</span></a><span> at “Happy birthday!” messages. It’s a creepy reminder that they already have quite a lot of information about you.</span></p>
<p><span>If Meta cannot guess your age, or if Meta infers you're too young, it will next ask you to </span><a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/3679110085670782"><span>verify your age</span></a><span> using either facial age estimation, or by uploading your photo ID.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span>Face Scan</span></h3>
<p><b>If you choose to use facial age estimation, you’ll be </b><a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/3679110085670782"><b>sent</b></a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/1386337538619854"><b>to</b></a> <a href="https://help.instagram.com/292521846402382/?helpref=search&amp;query=verification&amp;search_session_id=eb136014aeff03e55d346abf03249d73&amp;sr=14"><b>Yoti</b></a><b>, a third-party verification service.</b><span> Your photo will be uploaded to their servers during this process. Yoti </span><a href="https://www.yoti.com/blog/effective-facial-age-estimation-a-privacy-preserving-approach-to-age-assurance/"><span>claims</span></a><span> that “as soon as an age has been estimated, the facial image is immediately and permanently deleted.” Though it’s not as good as not having that data in the first place, Yoti’s </span><a href="https://www.yoti.com/security/"><span>security measures include</span></a><span> a bug bounty program and annual penetration testing. Researchers from Mint Secure found that Yoti’s app and website are </span><a href="https://mint-secure.de/dataprotection-it-security-risks-with-ageverificationapp-yoti/"><span>filled with trackers</span></a><span>, so the fact that you’re verifying your age could be not only shared to Yoti, but leaked to third-party data brokers as well.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may not want to use this option if you’re worried about third parties potentially being able to know you’re trying to verify your age with Meta. You also might not want to use this if you’re worried about a current picture of your face accidentally leaking—for example, if elements in the background of your selfie might reveal your current location. On the other hand, if you consider a selfie to be less sensitive than a photograph of your ID, this option might be better. If you do choose (or are forced to) use the face check system, be sure to snap your selfie without anything you'd be concerned with identifying your location or embarrassing you in the background in case the image leaks.</span></p>
<h3><span>Upload ID</span></h3>
<p><b>If Yoti’s age estimation decides your face looks too young, or if you opt out of facial age estimation, your next recourse is to </b><a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/671565971895323/"><b>send Meta a photo of your ID</b></a><b>.</b><span> Meta </span><a href="https://help.instagram.com/966909308115586/"><span>sends</span></a><span> that photo to Yoti to verify the ID. Meta says it will </span><a href="https://www.meta.com/help/quest/1266914157405903/"><span>hold onto that ID image</span></a><span> for 30 days, then delete it. Meanwhile, Yoti claims it will delete the image </span><a href="https://developers.yoti.com/age-verification/identity-verification"><span>immediately after verification</span></a><span>. Of course, bugs and process oversights exist, such as accidentally replicating information in logs or support queues, but at least they have stated processes. Your ID contains sensitive information such as your full legal name and home address. Using this option not only runs the (hopefully small, but never nonexistent) risk of that data getting leaked through errors or hacking, but it also lets Meta see the information needed to tie your profile to your identity—which you may not want. If you don’t want Meta to know your name and where you live, or rely on both Meta and Yoti to keep to their deletion promises, this option may not be right for you.</span></p>
<h2><span><a id="Google"></a>Google – Gmail, YouTube&nbsp;</span></h2>
<h3><span>Inferred Age</span></h3>
<p><b>If Google can guess your age, you may never even see an age verification screen.</b><span> Your Google account is typically connected to your YouTube account, so if (like mine) your YouTube account is old enough to vote, you may not need to verify your Google account at all. Google first uses </span><a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/extending-our-built-in-protections-to-more-teens-on-youtube/"><span>information it already knows</span></a><span> to try to guess your age, like how long you’ve had the account and your YouTube viewing habits. It’s yet another creepy reminder of how much information these corporations have on you, but at least in this case they aren’t likely to ask for even more identifying data.</span></p>
<p><b>If Google cannot guess your age, or decides you're too young, Google will next ask you to verify your age.</b><span> You’ll be given a variety of options for how to do so, with availability that will depend on your location and your age.</span></p>
<p><span>Google’s methods to assure your age include ID verification, facial age estimation, verification by proxy, and digital ID. To prove you’re over 18, you may be able to use facial age estimation, give Google your credit card information, or tell a third-party provider your email address.</span></p>
<h3><span>Face Scan</span></h3>
<p><b>If you choose to </b><a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/10071085#zippy=%2Cuse-a-selfie-for-age-verification"><b>use facial age estimation</b></a><b>, you’ll be sent to a website run by Private ID, a third-party verification service.</b><span> The website will load </span><a href="https://docs.privateid.com/age"><span>Private ID’s verifier</span></a><span> within the page—this means that your selfie will be checked without any images leaving your device. If the system decides you’re over 18, it will let Google know that, and only that. Of course, no technology is perfect—should Private ID be mandated to target you specifically, there’s nothing to stop it from sending down code that does in fact upload your image, and you probably won’t notice. But unless your threat model includes being specifically targeted by a state actor or Private ID, that’s unlikely to be something you need to worry about. For most people, no one else will see your image during this process. Private ID will, however, be told that your device is trying to verify your age with Google and Google will still find out if Private ID thinks that you’re under 18.</span></p>
<p><span>If Private ID’s age estimation decides your face looks too young, you may next be able to decide if you’d rather let Google </span><a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/10071085"><span>verify your age</span></a><span> by giving it your credit card information, photo ID, or digital ID, or by letting Google send your email address to a third-party verifier.</span></p>
<h3><span>Email Usage</span></h3>
<p><b>If you choose to </b><a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/10071085#zippy=%2Cuse-an-email-address-for-age-verification"><b>provide your email address</b></a><b>, Google sends it on to a company called VerifyMy.</b><span> VerifyMy will use your email address to see if you’ve done things like get a mortgage or paid for utilities using that email address. If you use Gmail as your email provider, this may be a privacy-protective option with respect to Google, as Google will then already know the email address associated with the account. But it does tell VerifyMy and its third-party partners that the person behind this email address is looking to verify their age, which you may not want them to know. VerifyMy uses “</span><a href="https://verifymy.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Verifymy-White-Paper-Innovative-age-assurance-Email-address-as-the-new-benchmark-for-frictionless-age-estimation.pdf"><span>proprietary algorithms and external data sources</span></a><span>” that involve sending your email address to “</span><a href="https://verifymy.io/age-verification-and-estimation/google-age-assurance-privacy-policy/#elementor-toc__heading-anchor-5"><span>trusted third parties, such as data aggregators</span></a><span>.” It claims to “ensure that such third parties are contractually bound to meet these requirements,” but you’ll have to trust it on that one—we haven’t seen any mention of who those parties are, so you’ll have no way to check up on their practices and security. On the bright side, VerifyMy and its partners do claim to delete your information as soon as the check is completed.</span></p>
<h3><span>Credit Card Verification</span></h3>
<p><b>If you choose to let Google </b><a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/10071085#zippy=%2Cuse-a-credit-card-for-age-verification"><b>use your credit card information</b></a><b>, you’ll be asked to set up a Google Payments account. </b><span>Note that debit cards won’t be accepted, since it’s much easier for many debit cards to be issued to people under 18.</span> <span>Google will then charge a small amount to the card, and refund it once it goes through. If you choose this method, you’ll have to tell Google your credit card info, but the fact that it’s done through Google Payments (their regular card-processing system) means that at least your credit card information won’t be sitting around in some unsecured system. Even if your credit card information happens to accidentally be leaked, this is a relatively low-risk option, since credit cards come with solid fraud protection. If your credit card info gets leaked, you should easily be able to dispute fraudulent charges and replace the card.</span></p>
<h3><span>Digital ID</span></h3>
<p><b>If the option is available to you, you may be able to use your digital ID to verify your age with Google.</b><span> In </span><a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/10071085#zippy=%2Cuse-a-digital-id-for-age-verification"><span>some regions</span></a><span>, you’ll be given the option to use your digital ID. In some cases, it’s possible to only reveal your age information when you use a digital ID. If you’re given that choice, it can be a good privacy-preserving option. Depending on the implementation, there’s a chance that the verification step will “</span><a href="https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/digital-identity-leaders-and-privacy-experts-sound-the-alarm-on-invasive-id-systems"><span>phone home</span></a><span>” to the ID provider (usually a government) to let them know the service asked for your age. It’s a complicated and varied topic that you can learn more about by visiting </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/issues/digital-identity"><span>EFF’s page on digital identity</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<h3><span>Upload ID</span></h3>
<p><b>Should none of these options work for you, your final recourse is to send Google a photo of your ID.</b><span> Here, you’ll be asked to take a photo of an acceptable ID and send it to Google. Though </span><a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/10071085#zippy=%2Cfind-valid-types-of-id-for-age-verification"><span>the help page only states</span></a><span> that your ID “will be stored securely,” the verification process page says ID “will be deleted after your date of birth is successfully verified.” Acceptable IDs </span><a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/10071085#zippy=%2Cfind-valid-types-of-id-for-age-verification%2Cget-country-specific-guidance"><span>vary by country</span></a><span>, but are generally government-issued photo IDs. We like that it’s deleted immediately, though we have questions about what Google means when it says your ID will be used to “improve [its] verification services for Google products and protect against fraud and abuse.” No system is perfect, and we can only hope that Google schedules outside audits regularly.</span></p>
<h2><span><a id="TikTok"></a>TikTok</span></h2>
<h3><span>Inferred Age</span></h3>
<p><b>If TikTok can guess your age, you may never even see an age verification notification.</b><span> TikTok first tries to use information you’ve posted to estimate your age, looking through your videos and photos to analyze your face and listen to your voice. By uploading any videos, </span><a href="https://support.tiktok.com/en/account-and-privacy/personalized-ads-and-data/how-we-process-face-and-voice-information"><span>TikTok believes you’ve given it consent</span></a><span> to try to guess how old you look and sound.</span></p>
<p><b>If TikTok decides you’re too young, appeal to revoke their age decision before the deadline passes.</b><span> If TikTok cannot guess your age, or decides you're too young, it will automatically revoke your access based on age—including either restricting features or deleting your account. To get your access and account back, you’ll have a </span><a href="https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/account-and-user-safety/minimum-age-appeals-on-tiktok#2"><span>limited</span></a> <a href="https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/account-and-user-safety/underage-appeals-on-tiktok#1"><span>amount of time</span></a><span> to verify your age. As soon as you see the notification that your account is restricted, you’ll want to act fast because in some places you’ll have as little as 23 days before the deadline passes.</span></p>
<p><span>When you get that notification, you’re given </span><a href="https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/account-and-user-safety/minimum-age-appeals-on-tiktok#3"><span>various</span></a> <a href="https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/account-and-user-safety/underage-appeals-on-tiktok#2"><span>options</span></a><span> to verify your age based on your location.</span></p>
<h3><span>Face Scan</span></h3>
<p><b>If you’re given the option to use facial age estimation, you’ll be </b><a href="https://support.tiktok.com/en/account-and-privacy/personalized-ads-and-data/how-we-process-face-and-voice-information"><b>sent to Yoti</b></a><b>, a third-party verification service.</b><span> Your photo will be uploaded to their servers during this process. Yoti </span><a href="https://www.yoti.com/blog/effective-facial-age-estimation-a-privacy-preserving-approach-to-age-assurance/"><span>claims</span></a><span> that “as soon as an age has been estimated, the facial image is immediately and permanently deleted.” Though it’s not as good as not having that data in the first place, Yoti’s </span><a href="https://www.yoti.com/security/"><span>security measures include</span></a><span> a bug bounty program and annual penetration testing. However, researchers from Mint Secure found that Yoti’s app and website are </span><a href="https://mint-secure.de/dataprotection-it-security-risks-with-ageverificationapp-yoti/"><span>filled with trackers</span></a><span>, so the fact that you’re verifying your age <em>could</em> be leaked not only to Yoti, but to third-party data brokers as well.</span></p>
<p><span>You may not want to use this option if you’re worried about third parties potentially being able to know you’re trying to verify your age with TikTok. You also might not want to use this if you’re worried about a current picture of your face accidentally leaking—for example, if elements in the background of your selfie might reveal your current location. On the other hand, if you consider a selfie to be less sensitive than a photograph of your ID or your credit card information, this option might be better. If you do choose (or are forced to) use the face check system, be sure to snap your selfie without anything you'd be concerned with identifying your location or embarrassing you in the background in case the image leaks.</span></p>
<h3><span>Credit Card Verification</span></h3>
<p><b>If you have a credit card in your name, TikTok will </b><a href="https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/account-and-user-safety/minimum-age-appeals-on-tiktok#3"><b>accept</b></a> <a href="https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/account-and-user-safety/underage-appeals-on-tiktok#2"><b>that</b></a><b> as proof that you’re over 18.</b><span> Note that debit cards won’t be accepted, since it’s much easier for many debit cards to be issued to people under 18. TikTok will charge a small amount to the credit card, and refund it once it goes through. It’s unclear if this goes through their regular payment process, or if your credit card information will be sent through and stored in a separate, less secure system. Luckily, these days credit cards come with solid fraud protection, so if your credit card gets leaked, you should easily be able to dispute fraudulent charges and replace the card. That said, we’d rather TikTok provide assurances that the information will be processed securely.</span></p>
<h3><span>Credit Card Verification of a Parent or Guardian</span></h3>
<p><b>Sometimes, if you’re between 13 and 17, you’ll be </b><a href="https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/account-and-user-safety/underage-appeals-on-tiktok#2"><b>given</b></a> <a href="https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/account-and-user-safety/minimum-age-appeals-on-tiktok#3"><b>the option</b></a><b> to let your parent or guardian confirm your age.</b><span> You’ll tell TikTok their email address, and TikTok will send your parent or guardian an email asking them (a) to confirm your date of birth, and (b) to verify their own age by proving that they own a valid credit card. This option doesn’t always seem to be offered, and in the </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TikTok/comments/1fapmrg/i_got_banned_for_being_underage_which_im_not_im/"><span>one case</span></a><span> we could find, it’s possible that TikTok never followed up with the parent. So it’s unclear how or if TikTok verifies that the adult whose email you provide is your parent or guardian. If you want to use credit card verification but you’re not old enough to have a credit card, and you’re ok with letting an adult know you use TikTok, this option may be reasonable to try.</span></p>
<h3><span>Photo with a Random Adult?</span></h3>
<p><b>Bizarrely, if you’re between 13 and 17, TikTok </b><a href="https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/account-and-user-safety/minimum-age-appeals-on-tiktok#3"><b>claims</b></a> <a href="https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/account-and-user-safety/underage-appeals-on-tiktok#2"><b>to offer</b></a><b> the option to take a photo with literally any random adult to confirm your age.</b><span> Its help page says that any trusted adult over 25 can be chosen, as long as they’re holding a piece of paper with the code on it that TikTok provides. It also mentions that a third-party provider is used here, but doesn’t say which one. We haven’t found any evidence of this verification method being offered. Please do let us know if you’ve used this method to verify your age on TikTok!</span></p>
<h3><span>Photo ID and Face Comparison</span></h3>
<p><b>If you aren’t offered or have failed the other options, you’ll have to verify your age by submitting a copy of your ID and matching photo of your face.</b><span> You’ll be sent to Incode, a third-party verification service. In a disappointing failure to meet the industry standard, Incode itself </span><a href="https://incode.com/privacy-policy/#data-security"><span>doesn’t automatically delete</span></a><span> the data you give it once the process is complete, but TikTok does </span><a href="https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/account-and-user-safety/minimum-age-appeals-on-tiktok"><span>claim</span></a> <a href="https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/account-and-user-safety/underage-appeals-on-tiktok"><span>to</span></a><span> “start the process to delete the information you submitted,” which should include </span><a href="https://developer.incode.com/reference/cleansingleonboardingsession"><span>telling Incode</span></a><span> to delete your data once the process is done. If you want to be sure, you can ask Incode to </span><a href="https://developer.incode.com/docs/incode-verify-identity-deletion-process#/"><span>delete that data yourself</span></a><span>. Incode tells TikTok that you met the age threshold without providing your exact date of birth, but then TikTok wants to know the exact date anyway, so it’ll ask for your date of birth even after your age has been verified.</span></p>
<p>TikTok itself might not see your actual ID depending on its implementation choices, but Incode will.&nbsp;<span>Your ID contains sensitive information such as your full legal name and home address. Using this option not only runs the (hopefully small, but never nonexistent) risk of that data getting accidentally leaked through errors or hacking. If you don’t want TikTok or Incode to know your name, what you look like, and where you live—or if you don't want to rely on both TikTok and Incode to keep to their deletion promises—then this option may not be right for you.</span></p>
<h2><a id="Everywhere-Else"></a><span>Everywhere Else</span></h2>
<p><span>We’ve covered the major providers here, but age verification is unfortunately being required of many other services that you might use as well. While the providers and processes may vary, the same general principles will apply.

<p>The Tesla Cybertruck program is in shambles. The latest data indicate production is running at roughly 10% of its planned capacity. Meanwhile, the Ford F150 Lightning outsold the Tesla Cybertruck in 2025 and was then canceled for not selling enough. </p>



<p>Is this what is coming for the Cybertruck?</p>



<p>Tesla is actively trying to hide its Cybertruck sales performance. We have to do the math ourselves.</p>



<p>Unlike virtually every other automaker that reports sales by model and region, Tesla bundles its vehicles into two broad categories: “Model 3/Y” and “Other Models.”</p>	
	



<p>The “Other Models” category includes the Model S, Model X, Cybertruck, and the Tesla Semi.</p>



<p>Model S and Model X sales have been relatively stable at a low volume, typically hovering around 5,000 to 6,000 units combined per quarter globally. If we assume a generous 6,000 units for S and X in Q4 2025 (aided by a slight update), that leaves only roughly <strong>5,600 units</strong> for the Cybertruck and Semi combined.</p>



<p>Considering the Semi is still in pilot production with negligible volume, we are looking at roughly 5,500 for the entire quarter globally (though it is still mostly North American).</p>



<p>This is a disaster compared to the truck’s peak and the company’s stated capacity.</p>



<p>We previously reported in July that <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/07/02/tesla-confirms-cybertruck-sales-are-down-to-just-5000-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tesla confirmed Cybertruck sales were down to ~5,000 units</a> in Q2 2025. It seems the “recovery” never happened, despite price cuts and the introduction of a short-lived, cheaper trim.</p>



<p>For the full year 2025, it could bring the total to about 21,500 Cybertrucks globally.</p>



<p>According to 2025 full-year data, the Ford F-150 Lightning delivered approximately 27,300 units in the US.</p>



<p>Think about that for a second. Ford officially announced it was <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/12/29/fords-f-150-lightning-sales-jumped-40-just-as-ford-announced-its-retirement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ending F-150 Lightning production in December</a> to pivot to its new EREV (extended-range electric vehicle) strategy. Yet, even as a “lame duck” product with widely publicised retirement plans, the Lightning still managed to find more buyers than Tesla’s Cybertruck.</p>



<p>While Ford’s sales dipped about 18% year-over-year as they wound down the program, Tesla’s numbers crashed by nearly 50% despite the company doing everything it can to keep the program alive.</p>



<p>Tesla and Elon Musk have thrown everything at the Cybertruck program, and it’s not working. They released a cheaper stripped-down version and <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/09/13/tesla-discontinues-cheapest-cybertruck/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">canceled it months later because it wasn’t selling</a>.</p>



<p>Last quarter, Musk even had his private company SpaceX <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/12/18/elon-musks-spacex-bought-tens-of-millions-worth-of-cybertrucks-tesla-cant-sell/">buy over 1,000 Cybertrucks</a>, which is about 20% of Tesla’s quarterly Cybertruck sales, and sales were still down more than 50% year-over-year in the quarter.</p>



<p>What happens with the Cybertruck from here?</p>



<h2 id="h-electrek-s-take">Electrek’s Take</h2>



<p>SpaceX can’t keep buying Cybertrucks, and I don’t know of any vehicle program that sells at 10% of its production capacity and survives.</p>



<p>It’s such a big hill to climb.</p>



<p>As I previously said, I think if Tesla were to distance itself from Musk’s toxic brand and do things such as give up on the 4680 cells, which appear to have contributed to the Cybertruck being more expensive and having a shorter range than originally announced, it could likely significantly boost Cybertruck sales.</p>




	<p>Enough to fill production capacity? Probably not, but it could get a lot closer.</p>



<p>Short of that, I don’t know where this can go. I think most other automakers would have written off the program already, but Musk can’t because of his ego. It would be admitting defeat.</p>



<p>It shows just how much he has changed in the last few years (beyond the obvious white-nationalist stuff), as Musk originally said <a href="https://electrek.co/2020/08/03/tesla-cybertruck-elon-musk-kick-most-ass/">Tesla would pivot to a more traditional design if the Cybertruck failed</a>. It has failed. Now what?</p>

<p>The indefinite pause, first reported by Fox News, is scheduled to take effect Jan. 21. It targets individuals deemed a potential "public charge", a legal standard used to determine if a non-citizen is likely to become primarily reliant on the state for subsistence.</p> 
<p>According to an internal State Department memo, consular officers have been directed to refuse visas under existing legal authorities while the agency conducts a comprehensive reassessment of its screening and vetting protocols.</p> 
<p><strong>Expanded Criteria for Refusal</strong></p> 
<p>The list of affected jurisdictions includes Somalia, Russia, Afghanistan, Brazil, Iran, Iraq, Egypt, Nigeria, Thailand, and Yemen.</p> 
<p>The directive follows a November 2025 cable from Secretary of State Marco Rubio that instructed global diplomatic posts to implement more rigorous screening. Under the updated guidance, officers are empowered to deny visas based on a "totality of circumstances," including:</p> 
<ul> 
 <li><strong>Health and Age:</strong> Applicants who are elderly or have chronic conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, or cancer face heightened scrutiny.</li> 
 <li><strong>Physical Condition:</strong> Consular staff may consider obesity a factor for denial if it is projected to lead to expensive, long-term medical costs.</li> 
 <li><strong>Financial and Personal Skills:</strong> Vetting now places greater emphasis on English language proficiency, education, and immediate financial resources.</li> 
 <li><strong>Benefit History:</strong> Any past reliance on government cash assistance or institutionalisation is treated as a significant "red flag."</li> 
</ul> 
<p>"The State Department will use its long-standing authority to deem ineligible potential immigrants who would become a public charge on the United States and exploit the generosity of the American people," State Department spokesperson Tommy Pigott said in a statement.</p> 
<p><strong>Context of the Crackdown</strong></p> 
<p>The suspension follows a series of aggressive immigration manoeuvres by the Trump administration in its first year back in office. Somalia has reportedly come under specific focus following a major taxpayer-funded benefit fraud scandal in Minnesota involving individuals of Somali descent.</p> 
<p>While the "public charge" provision has existed in the Immigration and Nationality Act for decades, its application has varied significantly between administrations. The 2022 Biden-era rules limited the scope of the test primarily to cash assistance and long-term care, excluding non-cash programs like SNAP (food stamps) or Medicaid. The new policy seeks to reverse that leniency, granting officers broad discretion to predict an applicant's future economic burden.</p> 
<p>The State Department noted that exceptions to the pause will be "very limited" and granted only to those who can demonstrably clear the public charge threshold.</p> 
<p><strong>List of Countries</strong></p> 
<p>The full list of countries comprises of Afghanistan, Albania, Algeria, Antigua and Barbuda, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bahamas, Bangladesh, Barbados, Belarus, Belize, Bhutan, Bosnia, Brazil, Burma, Cambodia, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Colombia, Cote d’Ivoire, Cuba, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Dominica, Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Fiji, Gambia, Georgia, Ghana, Grenada, Guatemala, Guinea, Haiti, Iran, Iraq, Jamaica, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kosovo, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Laos, Lebanon, Liberia, Libya, Macedonia, Moldova, Mongolia, Montenegro, Morocco, Nepal, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Pakistan, Republic of the Congo, Russia, Rwanda, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, Tanzania, Thailand, Togo, Tunisia, Uganda, Uruguay, Uzbekistan and Yemen</p>

<p><strong>Tuesday, January 13</strong></p>



<p>A farm in Saxony has been left with 4,000 tons of potatoes in what Berliner Morgenpost is calling “a story about the absurdities of our food system”. </p>



<p>A trader ordered the harvest but after the potatoes were harvested and stored, it became clear that the supply on the market was greater than the demand. The market price had fallen and although everything was financially settled, the potatoes remained.</p>



<p>4,000 tons is almost four million kilograms or the weight of 800 adult elephants. Stacking as high as Berlin’s TV Tower, so many potatoes could feed hundreds of thousands of people.</p>



<p>The first truckful of these potatoes, which were stored in cool, dry halls on a farm south of Leipzig, are now on their way to Berlin to be distributed for free. While Ecosia is financing the transport from Saxony to Berlin, the Berliner Morgenpost is helping to organise the free distribution.</p>



<p>The collaborative initiative plans to save the 4,000 tons of potatoes from being wasted. Registration to collect some free potatoes is now closed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, those who registered on time will receive an email stating whether their application was accepted or rejected. If it was accepted, they will received details about the date, approximate time and information about collection.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, you can still help the project. Berliner Morgenpost is looking for more places from which the potatoes can be distributed and accepting financial donations for further truckloads. You can find out more at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.4000-tonnen.de/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">www.4000-tonnen.de</a>.<a href="https://www.rbb24.de/panorama/beitrag/2026/01/kommentar-stromausfall-berlin-krisenmanagement.html"></a></p>

   <p>LIBERTY COUNTY, Ga. — What brings Greg Reyes to this Walmart south of Savannah are the low prices. He and his wife keep a close eye on their limited budget; she's retired and he's disabled. Their grocery list is always the same. But the prices have been changing.</p>   <p>"I used to pay like $40 a year ago, and now we're paying like $60," Reyes says. In his bags today are some chicken, turkey and beef. Other things simply had to go. "We don't buy ice cream no more because it's expensive," Reyes says. "It's kind of sad, but we have to do it like that."</p>   
   <p>The cost of living in the U.S. rose 2.7% in December compared with a year before, according to Tuesday's federal data. That's a steady slowdown after a yearslong stretch of intense inflation, but still painful.<em> </em>The past year also brought a global trade war, as President Trump imposed sweeping tariffs on nearly all imports. And the world continued to grapple with extreme weather, from droughts to downpours.</p>   <p>All of this is showing up in our shopping carts.</p>

   <p>Since 2018, NPR has <a href="https://www.npr.org/tags/755496161/npr-shopping-cart" target="_blank">tracked the prices</a> of dozens of items at this suburban Walmart superstore. Walmart is America's most popular retailer and the world's largest, which gives it the power to negotiate with suppliers for some of the lowest and most stable prices.</p>   <p>Here's what we learned on our latest price-check visit, in December. (Or skip the analysis<em> </em>to see the <a href="https://npr.org/nx-s1-5638908#responsive-embed-gkjRi">full details of NPR's shopping cart</a>.)</p>   <h3>Prices in NPR's basket rose 5% on average last year</h3>   <p>Almost half the items on NPR's shopping list got more expensive in 2025, including shrimp, Oreo cookies, Coca-Cola and Dove soap. Some price increases, notably on items made in China and Vietnam, appear to be tariff related. Other price hikes had to do with weather events affecting harvests of crops such as cacao and coffee beans.</p>

   <p>Just under a quarter of the items on NPR's list got cheaper, including eggs, milk and Cheerios. And many packaged foods stayed the same after years of price hikes.</p>   <p>As affordability became Americans' top concern, big brands began to worry about shoppers switching to store-label competitors or skipping some purchases altogether. To entice weary shoppers, NPR found, Walmart offered more discounts in December than it had in previous years.</p>   <p>A few disclaimers about our method:<br></p>   <ul><li>We went through almost every aisle in this Walmart to come up with the 114 items. (The full table is below.) To account for possible changes in package sizes, we focused on the price per unit, whether it was an ounce of salsa or a square foot of aluminum foil.<br></li><li>NPR reached out to the producers of all the items on our list that changed in price. Most companies did not respond. The few that did — including Kikkoman and Campbell's — noted that Walmart, as the retailer, has ultimate control over the prices that shoppers see on shelves.<br></li><li>A Walmart spokesperson said in a statement: "We remain dedicated to providing our customers Every Day low prices, with the goal of having the lowest price on a basket of goods over time." A store, for example, might extract deals from suppliers or charge slightly more for several items in order to sell something else at a break-even price or even below cost.</li></ul>   <h3>Tariffs loom over store shelves</h3>   <p data-pym-loader="" data-child-src="https://apps.npr.org/dailygraphics/graphics/walmart-illustrations-20260107/tariffs.html" id="responsive-embed-walmart-illustrations-20260107-tariffs"> Loading... </p>

   <p>With tariffs being the biggest story in retail in 2025, signs of their impact inevitably showed up in Walmart's aisles. Though it's hard to pin any price increase on tariffs with certainty, the through line was noticeable.</p>   <p>Some of the biggest price jumps were on items imported from countries saddled with hefty tariffs: Walmart's store-brand paper folders made in China (up 46%), swai fish fillets from Vietnam (up 34%), Farberware's plastic measuring spoons made in China (up 19%) and Schwinn's infant bike helmet, which used to be made in China but is now made in Vietnam (up 18%).</p>   <p>Walmart, Farberware and Schwinn did not comment on the impact of tariffs to NPR, but several other companies did. Dole, whose canned pineapple from Southeast Asia got 25% more expensive, cited weather-related crop shortages and tariffs on goods imported from the region.</p>

   <p>Reynolds Wrap, whose aluminum foil rose in price by 13%, called out "historic and sustained cost increases over the past year, driven by tariffs, global supply pressures, rising energy costs, and limited availability." Much of U.S. aluminum comes from Canada, and these imports now face a 50% tax.</p>   <p>Walmart in May warned that new tariffs would <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/05/15/nx-s1-5399154/walmart-higher-prices-tariffs" target="_blank">lead to higher prices</a>, as Trump threatened 145% tariffs on goods from China. The White House later paused, changed up and even rolled back some of its trade plans, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/11/14/g-s1-97936/trump-tariffs-executive-order-beef-coffee-fruit" target="_blank">namely on food items</a>. By August, Walmart officials said <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/08/21/nx-s1-5509592/walmart-tariff-costs-rising-earnings" target="_blank">tariff costs were rising "each week,"</a> although the company was able to mitigate many of them. In November, incoming Walmart CEO John Furner said tariffs brought "less impact" than expected early in the year.</p>   
   <h3>Climate chaos roiled many industries</h3>   <p data-pym-loader="" data-child-src="https://apps.npr.org/dailygraphics/graphics/walmart-illustrations-20260107/climate.html" id="responsive-embed-walmart-illustrations-20260107-climate"> Loading... </p>

   <p>Some of the items with the worst price hikes are repeat offenders: coffee, beef and chocolate. They, too, were affected by tariffs — such as beef and coffee <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/07/21/nx-s1-5470131/us-coffee-prices-brazil-trump-tariffs" target="_blank">coming from Brazil</a> — but the main culprit was the weather.</p>   <p>At this Walmart, the price of Maxwell House ground Colombian coffee rose by 46% in 2025 and its breakfast K-Cups by 34%. The costs of Hershey's and Lindt chocolates jumped around 26%. A pound of ground beef went up 30%, and the store now prominently displays a cheaper option: a blend of beef and ground pork.</p>   <p>The cost of coffee beans has soared as <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/09/30/nx-s1-5553625/coffee-day-farmers-industry-climate-change-labor-stenophylla" target="_blank">climate change</a> has brought erratic rainfall patterns, floods and droughts to farmlands. Cacao harvests, too, have come up short for <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/03/29/1240947073/cocoa-price-chocolate-kitkat-hershey" target="_blank">three years straight</a>; West African farmers, who grow most of the world's supply, have dealt with <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/08/01/1256575139/hershey-chocolate-prices-cocoa-shortage-climate-change" target="_blank">extreme weather</a>, changing climate patterns and disease in their aging trees. And the U.S. beef supply is at its <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/09/18/nx-s1-5534424/beef-prices-record-high-cost" target="_blank">lowest in decades</a>, driving cattle prices to <a href="https://esmis.nal.usda.gov/sites/default/release-files/g445cd121/kw52m9471/x346g4492/LDP-M-375.pdf" target="_blank">record highs</a>, in part because of drought.</p>   <p>Kraft Heinz (which owns Maxwell House), Hershey and Lindt &amp; Sprüngli in statements all cited the unprecedented higher costs of key raw materials, adding that they've also absorbed or offset part of those costs.</p>   <h3>Shrinkflation continues in the laundry aisle</h3>   <p>When inflation peaked after the COVID-19 pandemic, some manufacturers stealthily raised prices by <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/03/13/1198910739/consider-this-shrinkflation-is-real" target="_blank">shrinking their products</a> — shampoo, paper towels, chips and candy — while charging the same or slightly more. In 2022, for example, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/01/26/1147894382/walmart-price-inflation-supply-chain-economy" target="_blank">NPR's Walmart visit found</a> that Dove soap bars had shrunk by a quarter of an ounce, while rising in price by a few cents. (Dove maker Unilever did not comment.)</p>   <p>Last month, NPR spotted one case of shrinkflation: Tide laundry detergent. But the company says it's actually efficiency.</p>   <p data-pym-loader="" data-child-src="https://apps.npr.org/dailygraphics/graphics/walmart-tide-shrinkflation-20260108/" id="responsive-embed-walmart-tide-shrinkflation-20260108"> Loading... </p>

   <p>NPR first spotted Tide selling <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/01/26/1147894382/walmart-price-inflation-supply-chain-economy" target="_blank">less laundry detergent per bottle</a> in 2022: The amount of liquid had shrunk to 92 ounces from 100 ounces before the pandemic, and the price had risen by a dollar. After that, the cost stayed the same, but the contents shrank to 84 ounces in 2024 and then to 80 ounces in December.</p>   <p>The label continuously promised enough detergent for 64 loads of laundry.</p>   <p>Procter &amp; Gamble, which makes Tide as well as Head &amp; Shoulders shampoo (whose price rose almost 18%), told NPR that both products saw "meaningful upgrades" in the past year. Tide specifically got the "most significant upgrade to its liquid formula in over 20 years," according to the company, with a "boosted" level of active cleaning ingredients and updated dosage instructions.</p>   <p>"The result is superior cleaning performance in a smaller dose," a Procter &amp; Gamble representative said.</p>   <h3>Good news! Some things are cheaper</h3>   <p data-pym-loader="" data-child-src="https://apps.npr.org/dailygraphics/graphics/walmart-illustrations-20260107/cheaper.html" id="responsive-embed-walmart-illustrations-20260107-cheaper"> Loading... </p>

   <p>The biggest price drop finally came for eggs after record highs earlier in the year due to the <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/11/06/nx-s1-5600125/bird-flu-risk-outbreak-trump-administration" target="_blank">persistent bird flu</a>. By December, the price of a dozen eggs at Walmart dropped 30%. The cost of butter also dipped, by almost 16%, thanks to a glut in dairy production.</p>   <p>And as inflation-weary shoppers tighten their belts, brands have started doing something they rarely do: lowering prices. PepsiCo (maker of Lay's, Cheetos and Tostitos) last month said it would <a href="https://www.supermarketnews.com/beverages/pepsico-to-eliminate-nearly-20-of-products-reduce-prices" target="_blank">cut prices to boost sales</a>. General Mills (maker of Cheerios, Betty Crocker and Annie's) also confirmed it <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4823717-general-mills-inc-gis-q1-2026-earnings-call-transcript" target="_blank">plans to discount</a> roughly two-thirds of its offerings. NPR's price check found Cheerios costing 19% less than a year ago.</p>   <p>A Walmart spokesperson also told NPR that the chain has added more discounts (or "rollbacks," in Walmart parlance) than it had in the past two years. The company cited 13,000 of them in the first three quarters of 2025, of which about 2,000 became permanent price cuts.</p>   <p data-pym-loader="" data-child-src="https://apps.npr.org/datawrapper/gkjRi/11/" id="responsive-embed-gkjRi">Loading...</p>

<p>It is crazy, absolutely crazy to depend on open source to be free (as beer). It is not okay - it is not okay to consider that this labor fell from the sky and is a gift, and that the people/person behind are just doing it for their own enjoyments.</p>

<p>It is impossible to imagine that what we’re doing today is the only way. Begging/busking for donations, hoping to get noticed. Hoping for a <a href="https://x.com/OfficialLoganK/status/2009339263251566902">lifeline</a>.</p>

<p>Hence, a solution. Or an idea, really. Incredibly half-baked. Poke all the holes you want. It’s very unwrought and <em>muy</em> unripe.</p>

<p>GitHub should charge every org $1 more per user per month and direct it into an Open Source fund, held in escrow.</p>

<p>Those funds would then be distributed by usage - every mention in a package.json or requirements.txt gets you a piece of the pie.</p>

<p>You know how the money you pay to Spotify is very very very approximately (and not really fairly) distributed among artists that you listened to? Yes, Spotify is a very flawed model and artists are not doing well. But it is <em>a</em> model??</p>

<p>That’s it. That’s the idea. Call it the “Open Source Fund” thing, <strong>make it opt-out</strong>. Give every org a magical badge - or the ability to set their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hxdhb0BE2U">profile’s background css</a>.</p>

<p>Or don’t! Let’s not do anything! People’s code and efforts - fueling incredibly critical bits of infrastructure all around the world - should just be up for grabs. Haha! Suckers!</p>

<p>Alright, I don’t <em>know</em> how you fund Linux (does Linux appear in a requirements file). Hmm. Maybe <code>FROM</code> commands from Dockerfiles are also read &amp; applied. Maybe we at least start somewhere?</p>

<p>Anyway, you all smarter than me people can figure it out. I just cannot accept that what we have is “GOOD”. xx</p>

          <p>Researchers have discovered a never-before-seen framework that infects Linux machines with a wide assortment of modules that are notable for the range of advanced capabilities they provide to attackers.</p>
<p>The framework, referred to as VoidLink by its source code, features more than 30 modules that can be used to customize capabilities to meet attackers’ needs for each infected machine. These modules can provide additional stealth and specific tools for reconnaissance, privilege escalation, and lateral movement inside a compromised network. The components can be easily added or removed as objectives change over the course of a campaign.</p>
<h2>A focus on Linux inside the cloud</h2>
<p>VoidLink can target machines within popular cloud services by detecting if an infected machine is hosted inside AWS, GCP, Azure, Alibaba, and Tencent, and there are indications that developers plan to add detections for Huawei, DigitalOcean, and Vultr in future releases. To detect which cloud service hosts the machine, VoidLink examines metadata using the respective vendor’s API.</p>
<p>Similar frameworks targeting Windows servers have flourished for years. They are less common on Linux machines. The feature set is unusually broad and is “far more advanced than typical Linux malware,” <a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2026/voidlink-the-cloud-native-malware-framework/">said</a> researchers from Checkpoint, the security firm that discovered VoidLink. Its creation may indicate that the attacker’s focus is increasingly expanding to include Linux systems, cloud infrastructure, and application deployment environments, as organizations increasingly move workloads to these environments.</p>
<p>“VoidLink is a comprehensive ecosystem designed to maintain long-term, stealthy access to compromised Linux systems, particularly those running on public cloud platforms and in containerized environments,” the researchers said in a <a href="https://blog.checkpoint.com/research/voidlink-the-cloud-native-malware-framework-weaponizing-linux-infrastructure/">separate post</a>. “Its design reflects a level of planning and investment typically associated with professional threat actors rather than opportunistic attackers, raising the stakes for defenders who may never realize their infrastructure has been quietly taken over.”</p>

				<p>Edge of Emulation: Game Boy Sewing Machines</p>
				<p>. . . . . . . . . . .</p>

				<p><img src="https://shonumi.github.io/articles/sew_1.png" alt="Arts and crafts logo"></p>

				<p><strong>New threads</strong></p>

				<p>It's been quite a long journey so far, but today marks the 3rd anniversary of the <strong>Edge of Emulation</strong> series of articles. When I first worked on emulating the <a href="https://shonumi.github.io/articles/art6.html">Barcode Taisen Bardigun scanner</a> back in 2017, I actually had no idea how much more I'd be able to do. My goal was to finish a list, researching and documenting one item at a time, but I didn't know if I even possessed the right skills to achieve anything. In the past few the years, I've met a fair amount of challenges and faced a number of difficult problems. Nevertheless, I've somehow managed overcome each of these obstacles given enough time, determination, and the help of friends and colleagues. Some devices are really simple to figure out and only take a day or two to properly emulate. Others, however, prove stubbornly difficult. The subject of this article in particular really kicked my ass.</p>

				<p>In early 2000, the Japanese sewing company Jaguar released a machine with one very curious feature. Rather than having designs built-into the sewing machine, the Jaguar JN-100 (aka "nuyell") connected with a Game Boy via Link Cable to receive stitching instructions. The software, called Raku x Raku Mishin, came on a regular black Game Boy cartridge and handled transferring data to the JN-100. Users could then program the machine to stitch various patterns, buttonholes, kana, lettering, and even short custom paths. An American company called Singer found the JN-100 a tempting business opportunity; they later agreed release a near exact copy in the United States under their brand, the Singer IZEK 1500. In 2001, Jaguar made a second model called the JN-2000 (aka "nuotto") which boasted improved stitching speed and a dedicated embroidery arm called the EM-2000. While the JN-2000 was backwards compatible with the JN-100's Game Boy cartridge, 3 new pieces of software were made exclusively for the newer JN-2000's embroidery functions. Although Jaguar saw notable success with their products, Singer found less reception to the IZEK-1500 in the US. There were plans to make a newer version that handled embroidery as well, but Singer never fully realized those plans. As such, the JN-2000's ability to embroider clothes with Mario-themed artwork remained exclusive to Japan.</p>

				<p>Some may laugh at how bizarre it sounds to combine Game Boys and a sewing machines, yet all 3 models are rather historically important for both gaming and home-based sewing. Although industrial sewing machines already had programmable stitching for years, the consumer market lagged behind in terms of options and price. Today, cheap digitized sewing is the norm, but at the turn of the century, Jaguar sparked a sort of revolution by giving consumers affordable and easy to use equipment. Using a Game Boy as the primary interface reduces complexity (there are only a few buttons, menus can be colorful, and you can display as much information as you want, even tutorials). It also saves on cost by using known components instead of creating hardware from scratch. Furthermore, it's not uncommon to feed sewing machines instructions from an external source. Current sewing machines often connect to PCs via USB to transfer embroidery designs, and perhaps smartphone apps communicating over Bluetooth represents the future. At any rate, Nintendo's handheld system became the first (and only???) such device to work in conjunction with a sewing machine and did its part to bring digital stitching and embroidery to the masses. Though it seems like a strange marriage, both sides work well together in practice.</p>

				<p>Even so, these sewing machines are among the most exotic and fascinating of Game Boy accessories. They demonstrate just how far the humble Game Boy could expand beyond gaming. Unfortunately, while we know much about the history of the Jaguar and Singer machines, how exactly they operated remained a mystery for decades. Ever since I learned about them, I couldn't help but wonder what secrets were buried inside. Technically speaking, neither these sewing machines nor their software are video games. Nevertheless, they're all simply too culturally important to just ignore. Rather than let their story disappear over the ages, I decided to try my hand at preserving them. Now, I've emulated some pretty wild things on the Game Boy: motion-based infrared toys, sonar-enabled cartridges, Amiibo-like figurines, and robots most recently. But emulating a sewing machine? That's something else completely. I mean, you'd have to be crazy, right?</p>

				<p><strong>Needle in a haystack</strong></p>

				<p>Properly studying these machines requires physical access, which in turn means making quite a few investments. Not only are there 3 distinct models (JN-100, JN-2000, IZEK 1500), but each on their own costs a sizable sum. The JN-100 and IZEK 1500 units are uncommon but not necessarily rare, yet a handful of complications raise their prices. An IZEK 1500 typically runs anywhere from $150 to $250 USD on average for just the hardware alone, but adding original material such as the VHS instructional tape, the Game Boy software, or even the box it was packaged in will hike the value by hundreds of dollars. Shipping, even domestically, accounts for another $25 to $50 USD. JN-100s typically go for far less on Japanese buying sites. Many are labeled as "junk" and can go for $20 to $50 USD. However, international shipping can easily double or triple that amount.</p>
				
				<p>The JN-2000 is truly rare, given that it probably sold in smaller quantities. While a dozen or so auctions for the other two machines occur every few months, only a handful of JN-2000s appear to be sold each year. The damage to a collector's wallet varies wildly, from about $30, $160, $400, or even $1500 depending on completeness. The most expensive one I've seen to date asked for $5100, featuring a mint condition JN-2000, EM-2000, two copies of Raku x Raku Cut Shuu/Moji and one copy of Mario Family (which is probably the rarest Game Boy Color software out there). Needless to say, acquiring all three sewing machines took a fair amount of cash, patience, and luck. Thankfully I imported both Jaguar models well before COVID-19 struck. The virus has disrupted many forms of transportation, strangling shipping options, and increasing fees (sometimes exponentially in fact, looking at you DHL).</p>

				<p>As previously mentioned, the Jaguar JN-100 and the Singer IZEK-1500 are near perfect copies of one another in almost every regard. The only obvious differences are their power cords (retractable on the JN-100 versus one that plugs into the IZEK-1500) and the color schemes. While the JN-100 has 6 variants, the IZEK-1500 comes only in blue. Both machines have semi-transparent plastic parts that call to mind some of the iMac G3 aesthetic. The JN-2000 has a completely different body style, similar to other Singer products like many Futura models. It has clear plastic segments as well, although it was only ever produced in red. The frame of the machine has an empty cradle where a Game Boy can be placed while sewing. Most notably, part of the JN-2000 slides away to reveal a port where the EM-2000 embroidery arm connects. All 3 units have a Link Cable built-in.</p>

				<p><a href="https://shonumi.github.io/articles/sew_2_large.jpg"><img src="https://shonumi.github.io/articles/sew_2.png" alt="All three sewing machines on one desk"></a></p>
				<p>Left to right: IZEK 1500, JN-2000, JN-100. It wasn't easy fitting the whole gang on my desk. Click to enlarge.</p>

				<p>A total of 5 compatible software titles were made for these machines. The first, "Raku x Raku Mishin" came with every JN-100. It focuses on stitching preset and custom patterns, buttonholes, some Latin characters, kana, and a few kanji. When the IZEK-1500 came to the US, the name changed to "Sewing Machine Operating Software" however its core functionality remained unchanged. Instead of kana and kanji, however, support for the Latin alphabet was expanded along with a few additional styles (cursive and outlined letters). Apparently a European version exists, but details are scarce. "Raku x Raku Moji" deals with embroidery of katakana, hiragana, some Latin characters and symbols, and a number of kanji. Unlike Raku x Raku Mishin, these designs are much more elaborate, composed of hundreds of stitches instead of 20 or 30. "Raku x Raku Cut Shuu" deals with embroidery of some cute if generic artwork, e.g. a rocket ship, some flowers, and a bunch of cartoon animals. The last cartridge, "Jaguar Mishin Sashi Senyou Soft: Mario Family" is much the same, however, all of the artwork is Mario-themed. Princess Peach, Mario, Luigi, Wario, Yoshi, and several others appear, although Bowser is surprisingly absent.</p>

				<p><img src="https://shonumi.github.io/articles/sew_3.png" alt="3 GBC software titles that used embroidery"></p>
				<p>These GBC software titles are among the rarest. A Complete-in-Box copy Mario Family could easily require a small loan...</p>

				<p>My initial research into these sewing machines began exactly one year ago at the start of May 2019. Usually I spend only a few weeks on an item before cracking it. At most I'll take a few months, analyzing and running tests every other day until I figure things out. I really thought I'd be able to get most of the work done in a weekend or two. If things had gone according to plan, this article would have been written in 2019. Unfortunately, I spent far longer than just a couple of days. These sewing machines presented me with a puzzle the likes of which I'd never dealt with before and genuinely challenged me on multiple occassions. While I wouldn't call them the most difficult things to reverse engineer they certainly proved to be the most frustrating. What I expected to be a relative cakewalk turned into something much more than that.</p>

				<p><strong>Sew close, yet sew far</strong></p>

				<p>The Singer IZEK 1500 was the easiest machine to acquire, so it was the first one I looked at. To begin, I created a very simple ROM hack of Sewing Machine Operation Software that recorded every serial transfer after a serial interrupt. Interestingly enough, I didn't see any relevant data, just repeating patterns of two values: <code>0x00</code> and <code>0xFF</code>. Running the ROM through GBE+'s debugger revealed that not every transfer was supposed to trigger a serial interrupt; consequently the ROM hack was missing crucial information. Unlike every other Game Boy accessory ever made, the IZEK 1500 switches between sending data via an internal and external clock. Essentially, it switches back and forth between acting as master and slave when communicating with the Game Boy (and the handheld switches too, always the opposite to match the machine). The data the Game Boy sends to the IZEK 1500 is always done via an external clock, so the sewing machine controls the rate at which bits are transferred. Serial interrupts are disabled via software for these transfers, yet GBE+ could see them just fine and print out a log for me to review.</p>

				<p>The data captured by the emulator looked to be a packet sent to the sewing machine with instructions on how to stitch a pattern. Immediately, I recognized it had a header, followed by a body containing what looked to be XY coordinate pairs for stitching points and some kind of checksum value all the way at the end. As far as I could tell at the time, a pattern was made simply by shifting the stitching point up, down, left, or right by different amounts. In order for GBE+ to properly emulate these sewing machines, it had to recreate the stitching as pixels on a screen. All it needed to do was take the XY coordinates from the packet data and start drawing lines, right? Pretty simple stuff, and perfectly straightforward. Easy peasy.</p>

				<p>The first couple of patterns, labeled <code>A-001</code> through <code>A-010</code> were lines that moved straight down with changes in the X coordinate sometimes to make diagonals. I copied some line drawing code from my NDS 3D renderer, gave it the coordinates from the packet, and saved the results to a BMP file. The output from these patterns matched the previews given on the Game Boy screen. When it came to the rest of the patterns though, things quickly broke down. A prime example of this failure was pattern <code>B-007</code>. Rather than zig-zagging like the others, it went straight sideways and went vertically up. I was treating every Y coordinate as positive to move downward since I didn't know how the IZEK 1500 handled negative numbers. It should have been relatively obvious, say like all negative coordinates have Bit 7 set high or something, while all positive numbers have Bit 7 set low. It was nothing like that at all.</p>

				<p><img src="https://shonumi.github.io/articles/sew_4.png" alt="Pattern B-007"></p>
				<p>This is the pattern in question.</p>

				<p><code>---------------------------------------------------------
X COORDINATE	| Y COORDINATE		| MOVEMENT	
---------------------------------------------------------
0x01		| 0x0D			| DOWN		
0x01		| 0x0C			| DOWN		
0x01		| 0x14			| RIGHT		
0x0E		| 0x1C			| UP		
0x0E		| 0x14			| RIGHT		
0x1B		| 0x0C			| DOWN		
0x1B		| 0x0C			| DOWN		
0x1B		| 0x14			| LEFT		
0x01		| 0x0D			| DOWN		
---------------------------------------------------------</code>
				</p><p>Now here is the raw data sent by the Game Boy.</p>

				<p>I used a test piece of fabric and observed each movement to verify what each XY pair was supposed to do. It's easy enough to see that the X coordinates behave normally, gradually shifting from left to right by increasing, then suddenly shifting back to the left to restart the pattern. The Y coordinates are doing something else, however. At first glance, they're all over the place, although that's not quite unexpected considering the pattern goes up and down a bit. Still, the Y coordinates looked very bizarre to me when I started my investigation. One important detail to know is that while the X coordinates operate in terms of absolute positions, the Y coordinates don't. The width of a pattern only go so far, (<code>0x00</code> to <code>0x1F</code>), because the needle can only physically move that much. The length of a pattern goes as long as there's fabric to keep feeding into the machine.</p>

				<p>Y coordinates were quite the hassle to correctly interpret. In a sane world, values like <code>0x08</code> would move the fabric down by 8 units, <code>0x18</code> would move the fabric up 8 units, and <code>0x00</code> would stay put. Ideally, it would look like a 5-bit version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ones%27_complement">One's complement.</a> Just seems intuitive, right? The difference between up and down would be flipping Bit 4 on or off, and zero would maintain the current vertical position. That's what I was expecting, at least. The reality was much more difficult to deal with. In the example of Pattern B-007, it has a couple of vertical lines, but no Y coordinate even comes close to being zero. At the very least, you'd think that a horizontal line would be represented by having 2 different X coordinates and 2 Y coordinates of the same value, but that too was not the case.</p>

				<p>I was so preoccupied with how I felt the coordinates <strong>should</strong> have looked like that I failed to notice how the coordinates actually worked. I spent months trying to come up with all kinds of crazy rules to describe when the machines made horizontal, diagonal, and vertical lines for all other patterns. A lot of hours were wasted trying to formulate every possible scenario of X and Y coordinates and what kinds of lines they should have drawn. In hindsight, I missed several obvious clues that could have simplified my work.</p>

				<p>One day, while reviewing all of the rules I'd compiled, I suddenly noticed something very curious about horizontal lines. They all seemed to use <code>0x14</code> as the Y coordinate. Why use that value to signify no vertical change though? Why use that value instead of an actual zero? Another thought struck my mind: what if values less than <code>0x14</code> moved down, and values greater than that moved up? Suddenly almost every single pattern made perfect sense. Since GBE+ would take any pattern it captured via serial transfers and draw it to a BMP file, I could visually assess the results very quickly. With the old, complicated rules, only a handful actually looked correct while many did not. Once the code changed based on my new perspective, nearly all of the patterns were rendered appropiately. The last thing to do was calculate the right lengths for each Y coordinate. Ultimately, I came up with this chart:</p>

				<p><code>0x00				Shift Down 1.25mm	
0x01				Shift Down 1.1875mm	
0x02				Shift Down 1.125mm	
0x03				Shift Down 1.0625mm	
0x04				Shift Down 1.0mm	
0x05				Shift Down 0.9375mm	
0x06				Shift Down 0.875mm	
0x07				Shift Down 0.8125mm	
0x08				Shift Down 0.75mm	
0x09				Shift Down 0.6875mm	
0x0A				Shift Down 0.625mm	
0x0B				Shift Down 0.5625mm	
0x0C				Shift Down 0.5mm	
0x0D				Shift Down 0.4375mm	
0x0E				Shift Down 0.375mm	
0x0F				Shift Down 0.3125mm	
0x10				Shift Down 0.25mm	
0x11				Shift Down 0.1875mm	
0x12				Shift Down 0.125mm	
0x13				Shift Down 0.0625mm	
0x14				No Change		
0x15				Shift Up 0.0625mm	
0x16				Shift Up 0.125mm	
0x17				Shift Up 0.1875mm	
0x18				Shift Up 0.25mm		
0x19				Shift Up 0.3125mm	
0x1A				Shift Up 0.375mm

0x1D				Shift Up 0.5625mm	
0x1E				Shift Up 0.625mm	
0x1F				Shift Up 0.6875mm	
0x20				Shift Up 0.75mm		</code></p>

				<p>Solving the meaning of these Y values actually revealed one other oddity about the XY coordinates. For any given X coordinate, the Y coordinate that dictates vertical movement is the last previously sent Y coordinate, not the following Y coordinate. To illustrate this, going back to the coordinates for the pattern <code>B-007</code>, the first horizontal line going right doesn't really use XY values of <code>0x01, 0x14</code>. Instead, it's better read as <code>0x0E, 0x14</code>, where the X value indicates rightward movement, and the Y value indicates no vertical movement. It may be better to classify them as YX values, but in either case, the raw bytes of the coordinates are somewhat "misaligned" from a human perspective.</p> 

				<p>Converting this information into pixels was relatively straightforward. Every X value represents 1 pixel. For Y values, <code>0x14</code> is zero, every value above it simply moves up 1 pixel, and every value below it moves down 1 pixel. With that, even the most complicated patterns like swans, flowers, and hearts were drawing without any issue in GBE+. Even custom user-made patterns drew flawlessly. Figuring out XY coordinates caused plenty of headaches and a fair amount a swearing. Let me just say that the way these 3 machines handle everything is dumb. There's absolutely nothing intuitive about using <code>0x14</code> as a replacement for zero. There's absolutely nothing intuitive about using the previous Y coordinate instead of the next one. Maybe someone will point out that this is how many sewing machines work internally or it's just how things are done for devices like this or it's just how some microcontrollers are designed. I can actually see and understand the logic and reasoning behind some of it. But I don't care. It's dumb, and it will never not be dumb in my mind.</p>

				<p>Anyway, with every pattern working properly, I moved on to testing lettering. This feature only partially worked in GBE+. Strangely enough, the BMP output file used for debugging only showed the first couple of letters. For example, when trying to stitch "ABCD", only "AB" would show up. After thoroughly examining the data transferred from the Game Boy, I realized that GBE+ wasn't handling a key part of the packet format. When the Game Boy sends a packet to the sewing machine, the packet can only be 128 bytes long. Stitching a long sequence of letters, however, could require several hundred XY coordinates (as many parts are double or triple stitched). Sending that many XY coordinates means sending multiple packets, and GBE+ only handled the first one it encountered. With a few adjustments, GBE+ parsed all additional packets and fixed not only lettering but buttonholes as well.</p>

				<p><img src="https://shonumi.github.io/articles/sew_8.png" alt="Examples of some pattern from Raku x Raku Mishin/Sewing Machine Operation Software"></p>
				<p>A few of the more complex stitchings, some lettering, and some buttonholes. The buttonholes are apparently questionable even on real hardware.</p>

				<p><strong>Textile throwdown</strong></p>

				<p>After testing both the Sewing Machine Operation Software and Raku x Raku Mishin ROMs, I was satisfied that GBE+ could faithfully emulate the Singer IZEK 1500 and the Jaguar JN-100. This was only half the battle, as the Jaguar JN-2000 and its embroidery arm remained a total mystery. Given how complex embroidery can be, I could only imagine what it would be like to tackle the EM-2000. One major problem blocking progress was the fact that I didn't have an EM-2000 at all. The only time I found a couple for sale, they came with the JN-2000, which would have set me back well over $1000 in those cases. It wasn't until after I finished all my research on these machines that one reasonably priced auction actually popped up. Needless to say, I didn't have the hardware I needed.</p>

				<p>The EM-2000, however, looks a lot like some of the embroidery arms Singer made around that time for some of its Futura models. The two look identical save for the color scheme. I suspected that a Futura embroidery arm might work with the JN-2000. After all, the Singer IZEK 1500 was a copy+paste clone of the JN-100, so maybe the two companies shared more designs with each other. When my own Futura embroidery arm arrived, it wouldn't fit into the JN-2000's slot, as it had two little pieces of plastic preventing them from sliding together. An hour of sanding by hand removed the plastic guards and allowed the Futura hardware to fit onto the JN-2000. Unfortunately, it was totally incompatible. No software recognized that embroidery arm was attached.</p>

				<p><img src="https://shonumi.github.io/articles/sew_5.png" alt="EM-2000 and Futura"></p>
				<p>On the left, the EM-2000. On the right, a Futura embroidery arm. They look like twins. Same size, same shape. Sadly, only one is compatible with the JN-2000.</p>

				<p>With no means of probing the hardware directly, my only option was to reverse-engineer the software and whatever protocol the Game Boy used during embroidery. The first challenge is to determine how the JN-2000 reports to the Game Boy whether or not the EM-2000 is present. Before and after sending a packet to the sewing machines, the Game Boy issues a sort of "keep-alive" byte to continually check the connection. The sewing machines are supposed to return their current status as a single byte. Responding with zero allowed most of the IZEK 1500 and JN-100 stuff to process normally, but Raku x Raku Moji, Raku x Raku Cut Shuu, and Mario Family all complained about the missing EM-2000. By accident, I had previously discovered that setting Bit 1 of the status byte high caused the software to believe the EM-2000 was there. After trying a few more random values, it appeared that <code>0x06</code> and <code>0x07</code> let the software continue with no errors. The first seemed to indicate a small embroidery hoop was attached, and the second indicated a large embroidery hoop was attached. Only certain designs can be stitched with a large hoop.</p>

				<p>Using the correct status byte triggered a transfer instead of an error. The data sent from the Game Boy looked very similar to the other packets used by the IZEK 1500 and JN-100. The format of the coordinate data was clearly different, however. Unlike the other somewhat convoluted coordinate scheme, the embroidery coordinates were straightforward and easy to understand. Almost immediately I saw how it worked just by glancing at the numbers. A value like <code>0x05</code> would move the stitching point right 5 units for X coordinates or down 5 units for Y coordinates. A value like <code>0x45</code> would move the stitching point left 5 units for X coordinates or up 5 units for Y coordinates. If Bit 6 is set high, X and Y coordinates move in one directions, otherwise they go in the opposite direction. XY coordinates weren't mismatched either. That was the kind of simplicity I was looking for with the IZEK 1500 and JN-100!</p>

				<p>By connecting the lines between these coordinates, GBE+ started drawing many of the designs. Unfortunately, nearly all of them had serious rendering problems, with bits and pieces all over the place. Mario had a misplaced face, Princess Peach had none, and Luigi was just a pile of squiggles. In each case, only the inital part looked correct, then promptly went off the rails. When doing embroidery, designs are broken up into several continuous sections. Most of the time, a large portion of the design can be stitched from one point to the next, sort of like contour drawing. At other times, however, it's impossible to stitch certain segments without completely switching to a new postion that's not connected to the old one. Examples of this include the eyes of many characters, objects not attached to one another (the bubbles surrounding the dolphin character), and colored areas distinctly separated by outlines or other colors. The JN-2000 basically stops stitching while the embroidery arm moves to a new position. GBE+ was treating everything like one long, connected line, never moving to that next location when necessary. Inside some of the packets sent to the JN-2000 are sections that describe how it should jump to a new area. They begin with a <code>0xBE</code> byte and end with a <code>0xBD</code> byte. Data looks something like this sample:</p>

				<p><code>0xBE		START	
0xEB		BYTE 1	
0xFF		BYTE 2	
0xBA		BYTE 3	
0x00		BYTE 4	
0xFF		BYTE 5	
0x00		BYTE 6	
0x00		BYTE 7	
0x00		BYTE 8	
0x00		BYTE 9	
0xBD		END	</code></p>

				<p>My first thought was that the above data represented some kind of 16-bit number transferred Least Significant Byte (LSB) first. So the first two bytes form the hexadecimal number <code>0xFFEB</code>. By that same logic the second 16-bit number should be <code>0x00BA</code>. Assuming that these 16-bit numbers are X and Y shifts, the first number might be something like a negative X value (move left), and the second might be a positive Y value (move down). However, when examining the rest of the data, there is an odd amount of bytes. There is enough for 4 16-bit numbers and one extra 8-bit value left over. This part really confused me for a few days. From the above data, it looks like the 3rd 16-bit value should be <code>0x00FF</code> and the 4th 16-bit value should be <code>0x0000</code> with the last byte just hanging there.</p>

				<p>As I looked over different sets of shift data, I had one of those moments where an idea just jumps into your head. What if, in the above data, the 5th byte merely acted as a sort of separator for the next 16-bit X and Y shifts? That would explain why the Game Boy sent an odd number of bytes. Other designs had multiple shifts, and when I checked my logs, I found that after every X and Y shift, there was in fact a <code>0xFF</code> byte placed in between them. For the above data, the last X and Y shifts are just zero, indicating no movement. With a few changes in GBE+'s code, the emulator began to correctly parse all shift coordinates. The only thing that went wrong was getting the up and down directions reversed.</p>

				<p><code>0xFFEB		X SHIFT #1	MOVE LEFT 21	
0x00BA		Y SHIFT #1	MOVE UP 186	
						
0x0000		X SHIFT #2	NO MOVEMENT	
0x0000		Y SHIFT #2	NO MOVEMENT	</code></p>

				<p>A few designs were still messed up, however. After certain shifts, the X and Y stitching coordinates were mixed up, leading to lines that went in all sorts of directions. Packets sent to the JN-2000 are only 128 bytes long, and sometimes the shift data has to get split across two packets. This proved tricky to handle. All three sewing machines use the byte <code>0xB9</code> to signal the start of a packet and <code>0xBB</code> to signal the end of another one. These bytes had to be checked to determine whether they were part of packet management or if they were in fact part of the shift data.</p>

				<p>The last things to solve were the initial X and Y coordinates. All embroidery designs are in fact several designs in a sequence. For example, Mario Family will first draw Yoshi's green parts, then move onto the shoes and spikes on the back, followed by the saddle, the white tummy, and finally the overall outline. The idea is to embroider portions that use the same color. The software asks the user to select a new thread and sends separate transmissions to the JN-2000. The first packet of each transmission dictates the starting X and Y position. These have no relation to any of the previous stitching points or shift coordinates, as the user can actually transfer any part of the design out of order or skip sections entirely (for example, when using white fabric as the base, you may not want to embroider Mario's gloves). If the wrong start coordinates are used, then nothing matches up as it should when drawing every segment.</p>

				<p><img src="https://shonumi.github.io/articles/sew_6.gif" alt="Black and white demo of drawing each piece of the Mario embroidery design"></p>
				<p>This demonstrates how initial X and Y values are supposed to work. Each piece is stitched separately, but they all have to line up properly.</p>

				<p>The starting X and Y coordinates are also 16-bit LSB values. They are absolute values, meaning they dictate exactly where to start stitching inside the embroidery hoop. Users can choose the starting point themselves via software, and the Game Boy will transmit the appropiate data. By manipulating this feature, it was possible to record the maximum and minimum X and Y values and thereby reveal how these coordinates worked. The right side is defined as <code>0xFFF</code> and the left side is defined as <code>0xFED0</code>. The top is defined as <code>0xFFFF</code> and the bottom is defined as <code>0xFE30</code>. With those measurements, GBE+ could plot the correct starting point for each design. This in turn finally fixed every outstanding issue for embroidery.</p>

				<p><img src="https://shonumi.github.io/articles/sew_7.png" alt="Several designs from Mario Family + GBE+ output"></p>
				<p>At long last, everything looks perfect!</p>

				<p><strong>Stitching it all together</strong></p>

				<p>Emulating these sewing machines up to this point was mainly GBE+ spitting out an image file once it finished processing the final packet sent by the software. This approach, while suitable for debugging and experimental code, is very unsatisfying for normal users. Although it technically gets the job done, I've always felt emulation should be about exploring things, not merely recreating them for observation. To truly preserve the overall experience of the something like the IZEK-1500, people need to interact and control the output in real-time. It all comes back to the question: how does one really emulate a sewing machine?</p>

				<p>In my previous article about the <a href="https://shonumi.github.io/articles/art20.html">Cyber Drive Zoids</a> toys, I used a sub-screen to draw a tiny little animated robot that mimicked the model, albeit somewhat crudely. My inspiration for a sub-screen in Cyber Drive Zoids actually came from my work on these sewing machines, I just ended up completing that project first. The idea here is to use a sub-screen as a sort of drawing pad. A cursor moves around, and with the mere push of a button, patterns and designs start appearing. A secondary interface in the form of a menu helps dynamically set different options, such as thread coloring, thread thickness, stitching speed, saving the image, clearing the image, and attaching/detaching an emulated EM-2000.</p>

				<p>The end results were quite pleasing, feeling very much like a virtual sewing machine. I think it provides a lot of value in that the sub-screen demonstrates exactly how the sewing machines would have stitched things. For example, it illustrates the way an EM-2000 would have moved back and forth, showing us exactly how the real thing creates designs like Mario and company. Most of us will never get the chance to see these devices with our own eyes, much less poke around the patterns they made. Now, however, anyone can see for themselves what all the fuss was about.</p>

				<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NIZGflArRHw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
				<p>Even though these aren't really games, you can still have fun playing around with them!</p>

				<p><strong>Loose ends</strong></p>

				<p>Before closing this article, I'd like to take the time to cover some misconceptions surrounding the sewing machines. First, the <strong>only</strong> sewing machine capable of doing elaborate embroidery designs is the JN-2000. You can't use the IZEK-1500 or the JN-100 with Mario Family, for example, because they can't use the EM-2000. They lack the slot at their base for the embroidery arm. Interestingly enough, both the Raku x Raku Mishin and Sewing Machine Operation Software cartridges have error messages complaining that the EM-2000 is attached, even though it's probably impossible to do so (without some extreme modifications at least). This suggests that the EM-2000 was in development when the JN-100 was released, and it's also probable that IZEK expected to make their own model based on the JN-2000.</p>

				<p>The second point I want to bring up is that while the Game Boy does display a preview of each embroidery design for the JN-2000, the pixel art is only an approximation of the final stitching. There are some details that just don't fit on the 160x144 screen. For example, for Princess Peach, the Game Boy omits her eyebrows, eyelashes, the ruffles on her dress around the neck, and the gap between her gloves and the sleeves or her dress. The embroidery is far more intricate in many cases than the software presents, especially regarding some of Raku x Raku Cut Shuu's designs. The final results, in any case, are impressive in contrast to their Game Boy representations.</p>

				<p>Lastly, yes, these sewing machines really did work! This is strangely a common reaction when people learn about these models (I mean, would Jaguar or Singer really sell such an expensive yet defective product?) All 3 of them are actually pretty good machines, and they can work without the Game Boy, though at that point they're limited to stitching straight lines. They did everything they claimed they could without much if any trouble.</p>

				<p><strong>Clothing arguments</strong></p>

				<p>Dealing with these sewing machines has definitely been a wild ride. They turned out to be quite a handful, but in the end I feel it was worth all of the work. Each one adds a very unique chapter to video game history that we will hopefully never lose now. It's been 20 years since the JN-100 first brought Game Boy powered sewing to the world, so for the anniversary of that achievement, I can think of no better way to celebrate it than via emulation.</p>

				<p>I've been fascinated with exotic gaming peripherals for some time, but I have to admit, the JN-100, JN-2000, and IZEK-1500 are by far the most impressive ones I've examined. It's just one of those things where you simply shake your head thinking about how nuts it sounds. A sewing machine controlled by a Game Boy? I remember when MAME finally emulated a <a href="https://sonic.fandom.com/wiki/SegaSonic_Popcorn_Shop">Sonic The Hedgehog popcorn machine,</a> and I thought that was some downright insane dedication to video game preservation. Ever since then, I've wanted to do something similar, bringing a big, bulky, weird piece of hardware back to life, something that was flashy, hard to find, and expensive. I think I've fulfilled that goal now.</p>

				<p>It seems like I just started writing these articles not too long ago, but it's already been 3 years! In that time, I'm proud to say that nearly all of the add-ons that directly affected gameplay and software programming in commercial DMG and GBC games are emulated in some capacity! Only 1 notable DMG accessory is still at large. When I started in 2017, there were numerous unknowns, with at least 7 devices that hadn't been researched at all in decades. I hope I've done my small part to make Game Boy emulation as a whole better, and I hope that these <strong>Edge of Emulation</strong> articles inspire people to start looking at other areas of gaming that remain forgotten and need preservation. Having said all of that, my path is far from complete. That TODO list of mine just never seems to get any shorter. My ambition for 2020 is to continuously jump from one item to the next, and I've already got my sights set on the next big thing: the AGS-006, aka the Play-Yan. With any luck, I'll have something to report in the next few months.</p>

				<p>When I <a href="https://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/2012/02/03/presenting-nukemap/">created the NUKEMAP in 2012</a>, the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/">Google Maps API</a> was&nbsp;<em>amazing</em>.<sup><a href="#footnote_1_6768" id="identifier_1_6768" title="For non-coders: an API is a code library that lets third-party developers use someone else’s services.

I made it for my own personal use and for teaching. At right, the remade original <a href="https://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/2012/02/03/presenting-nukemap/">NUKEMAP from 2012</a>, which used the Google Maps API/Javascript.</p></div>
<p>Today, pretty much all of that is now untrue.&nbsp;The API codebase has stagnated in terms of&nbsp;<em>actually useful features</em> being added (many neat features have been removed or quietly deprecated; the new features being added are generally incremental and lame), which is really quite remarkable given that the Google Maps stand-alone website (the one you visit when you go to Google Maps to look up a map or location) has had a <em>lot</em> of neat features added to it (like its 3-D mode) that have&nbsp;<em>not</em> been ported to the API code (which is why <a href="https://nuclearsecrecy.com/nukemap3d/">NUKEMAP3D is effectively dead</a> — Google deprecated the Google Earth Plugin and has never replaced it, and no other code base has filled the gap).<sup><a href="#footnote_2_6768" id="identifier_2_6768" title="Before people e-mail me about how CesiumJS fills the Google Earth Plugin gap — it doesn’t, because it doesn’t give you the global coverage of 3D buildings that you need to make sense of the size of a mushroom cloud.

If you do want to render volumetric mushroom clouds in the stand-alone Google Earth program, there is a (still experimental and incomplete) feature in NUKEMAP for exporting cloud shapes as KMZ files. See the NUKEMAP3D page for more information on how to use this.">2</a></sup></p>
<p>But more importantly, the&nbsp;changes to the pricing model that have been recently put in place are, to put it lightly,&nbsp;<em>insane,&nbsp;</em>and <em>punishing</em> if you are an educational web developer that builds anything that people actually find useful.</p>
<p>NUKEMAP gets around 15,000 hits a day on a slow day, and around 200,000 hits a day per month, and has done this consistently for over 5 years (and it occasionally has spikes of several hundred thousand page views per day, when it goes viral for whatever reason). While that’s pretty impressive for an academic’s website, it’s what I would call “moderately popular” by Internet terms. I don’t think this puts the slightest strain on Google’s servers (who also run, like, <em>all of YouTube</em>). And from 2012 through 2016, Google didn’t charge a thing for this. Which was pretty generous, and perhaps unsustainable. But it encouraged a lot of experimentation, and something like NUKEMAP wouldn’t exist without that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2016, they started charging. It wasn’t too bad — at most, my bill was around $200 a month. Even that is pretty hard to do out-of-pocket, but I’ve had the good fortune to be associated with an institution (my employers, the College of Arts and Letters at the Stevens Institute of Technology) that was willing to foot the bill.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But in 2018, Google changes its pricing model, and my bill jumped to more like $1,800 p<em>er month</em>. As in, over $20,000 a year. Which is several times my main hosting fees (for&nbsp;<em>all</em> of my websites).</p>
<p>I reached out to Google to find out why this was. Their <a href="https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/pricing/sheet/">new pricing sheet</a> is… a little hard to make sense of. Which is sort of why I didn’t see this coming. They do have a “<a href="https://mapsplatformtransition.withgoogle.com/calculator">pricing calculator</a>,” though, that lets you see exactly how terrible the pricing scheme is, though it is a little tricky to find and requires having a Google account to access. But if you start playing with the “dynamic map loads” button (there are other charges, but that’s the big one) you can see how expensive it gets, quickly. I contacted Google for help in figuring all this out, and they fobbed me off onto a non-Google “valued partner” who was licensed to deal with corporations on volume pricing. Hard pass, sorry.</p>

<p>I know that Google in theory supports people using their products for “social causes,” and if one is at a non-profit (as I am), <a href="https://www.google.com/nonprofits/offerings/google-earth-and-maps.html">you can apply for a “grant”</a> to defray the costs, assuming Google assume’s you’re doing good. I don’t know how they feel about the NUKEMAP, but in any case, it doesn’t matter: people at educational institutions (even not-for-profit ones, like mine) are <a href="https://www.google.com/nonprofits/eligibility/"><em>disqualified</em></a> from applying. Why? Because Google wants to capture the educational market in a revenue-generating way, and so directs you to their <a href="https://edu.google.com/">Google for Education</a> site, which as you will quickly find is based on a very different sort of model. There’s no e-mail contact on the site, as an aside: you have to claim you are representing an entire educational institution (I am not) and that you are interested in implementing Google’s products on your campus (I am not), and if you do all this (as I did, just to get through to them) you can finally talk to them a bit.</p>
<p>There is <em>literally nothing</em> on the website that suggests there is any way to get Google Maps API credit, but they do have a way to request discounted access to the Google Cloud Platform, which appears to be some kind of machine-learning platform, and after sending an e-mail they did say that you could apply for Google Cloud Platform funds to be used for Google Maps API.</p>
<p>By which point I had already, in my heart, given up on Google. It’s just not worth it. Let me outline the reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>They clearly don’t care about small developers. That much is pretty obvious if you’ve tried to develop with their products. Look, I get that licensing to big corporations is the money-maker. But Google pretends to be developing for more than just them… they just don’t follow through on those hopes.</li>
<li>They can’t distinguish between universities as entities, and academics as university researchers. There’s a big difference there, in terms of scale, goals, and resources. I don’t make university IT policy, I do research.&nbsp;</li>
<li>They are fickle. It’s not just the fact that they change their pricing schemes rapidly, it’s not just that they deprecate products willy-nilly. It’s that they push out new products, encourage communities to use them to make “amazing” things, and then don’t support them well over the long term. They let cool projects atrophy and die. Sometimes they sell them off to other companies (e.g., SketchUp), who then totally change them and the business model. Again, I get it: Google’s approach is throwing things at the wall, hoping they stick, and believes in disruption more than infrastructure, etc. etc. etc. But that makes it pretty hard to justify putting all of your eggs in their basket.</li>
<li>I don’t want to worry about whether Google will think my work is a “social good,” I don’t want to worry about re-applying every year, I don’t want to worry about the branch of Google that helps me out might vanish tomorrow, and so on. Too much uncertainty. Do you know how hard it is to get in contact with a real human being at Google? I’m not saying they’re impossible — they did help me waive some of the fees that came from me not understanding the pricing policy — but that took literally&nbsp;<em>months&nbsp;</em>to work out, and in the meantime they sent a collection agency after me.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>But most of all: today there are <em>perfectly viable alternatives</em>. Which is why I don’t understand their pricing model change, except in terms of, “they’ve decided to abandon small developers completely.” After a little scouting around, I decided that <strong><a href="https://www.mapbox.com/">MapBox</a></strong> completely fit the bill (and whose rates are more like what Google used to charge), and that <a href="https://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet</a>, an open-source Javascript library, could make for a very easy conversion. It took a little work to make the conversion, because Leaflet out of the box doesn’t support the drawing of great circles, but I <a href="https://github.com/nuclearsecrecy/Leaflet.greatCircle">wrote a plugin</a> that does it.</p>
<div id="attachment_6859"><p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/nukemap.2.65.jpg?ssl=1"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6859" loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/nukemap.2.65.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1" alt="Screenshot of NUKEMAP 2.65" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/nukemap.2.65.jpg?w=1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/nukemap.2.65.jpg?resize=600%2C377&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/nukemap.2.65.jpg?resize=768%2C483&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-6859"><a href="https://nuclearsecrecy.com/nukemap/">NUKEMAP</a> as of this moment (version 2.65; I make small incremental changes regularly), with its Mapbox GL + Leaflet codebase. Note that a while back I started showing the 1 psi blast radius as well, because I decided that omitting it caused people to underestimate the area that would be plausibly affected by a nuclear detonation.</p></div>
<p>Now, even MapBox’s pricing scheme can add up for my level of map loads, but they’ve been extremely generous in terms of giving me “credits” because they support this kind of work. And getting that worked out was a matter of sending an e-mail and then talking to a real person on the phone. And said real person has been extremely helpful, easy to contact, and even reaches out to me at times when they’re rolling out a new code feature (like Mapbox GL) that he thinks will make the site work better and cheaper. Which is to say: in every way, the opposite of Google.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So NUKEMAP and <a href="https://nuclearsecrecy.com/missilemap/">MISSILEMAP</a> have been converted entirely over to MapBox+Leaflet. The one function that wasn’t easy to port over was the “Humanitarian consequences” (which relies on Google’s Places library), but I’ll eventually figure out a way to integrate that into it.</p>
<p>More broadly, the question I have to ask as an educator is: would I encourage a student to develop in the Google Maps API if they were thinking about trying to make a “break-out” website? Easy answer: no way. With Google, becoming popular (even just “moderately popular”) is a losing proposition: you will find yourself owing them a lot of money. So I won’t be teaching Google Maps in my data visualization course anymore — we’ll be using Leaflet from now on.&nbsp;I apologize for venting, but I figured that even non-developers might be interested in knowing on how these things work “under the hood” and what kinds of considerations go into the choice of making a website these days.</p>

At top, me standing out my office (for an entire 24 hours) in the wake of a 20 kt detonation in downtown NYC using the weather conditions that exist as I am posting this: I am very very dead. At bottom, I instead run quickly into the basement bowling alley in the Stevens University Howe Center (my preferred shelter location, because it’s fairly deep inside a multi-story rocky hill, on top of which is a 13 story building), and the same length of time gives me, at most, a slight up-tick in long-term cancer risk.</p></div>
<p>More positively, I’m excited to announce that a little while back, I added a new feature to NUKEMAP, one I’ve been wanting to implement for some time now. The NUKEMAP’s fallout model (<a href="http://nuclearsecrecy.com/nukemap/faq/#fallout">the Miller model</a>) has always been a little hard to make intuitive sense out of, other than “a vague representation of the area of contamination.” I’ve been exploring some other fallout models that could be implemented as well, but in the meantime, I wanted to find a way to make the current version (which has to advantage of being very quick to calculate and render) more intuitively meaningful.</p>
<p>The Miller model’s contours give the dose intensity (in rad/hr) at H+1 hour. So for the “100 rad/hr” contour, that means: “this area will be covered by fallout that, one hour after detonation, had an intensity of 100 rad/hr, assuming that the fallout has actually arrived there at that time.” So to figure out what your exposure on the ground is, you need to calculate when the fallout actually arrives to you (on the wind), what the dose rate is at time of arrival, and then how that dose rate will decrease over the next hours that you are exposed to it. You also might want to know how that is affected by the kind of structure you’re in, since anything that stands between you and the fallout will cut your exposure a bit. All of which makes for an annoying and tricky calculation to do by hand.</p>
<p>So I’ve added a feature to the “Probe location” tool, which allows you to sample the conditions at any given distance from ground zero. It will now calculate the time of fallout arrival (which is based on the distance and the wind settings), the intensity of the fallout at the time of arrival, and then allow you to see what the total dose would be if you were in that area for, say, 24 hours after detonation. It also allows you to apply a “protection factor” based on the kind of building you are in (the protection factor is just a divisor: a protection factor of 10 reduces the total exposure by 10). All of which can be used to answer questions about the human effects of fallout, and the situations in which different kinds of shelters can be effective, or not.<sup><a href="#footnote_3_6768" id="identifier_3_6768" title="I’ll eventually update the NUKEMAP FAQ about how this works, but it just uses Wigner’s standard t-1.2 fission product decay rate formula.">3</a></sup></p>
<p>There are some more NUKEMAP features actively in the works, as well. More on those, soon.</p>

<p>This is a brief blog post to highlight the growth of the Servo community in recent years, particularly since <a href="https://igalia.com/">Igalia</a> took over the project maintenance in 2023.</p>
<p>Note that this doesn’t talk about the technical achievements, though there have been tons of them in the last years. <em>A picture is worth a thousand words</em> so just take a look at <a href="https://blogs.igalia.com/mrego/servo-a-new-web-engine-written-in-rust/">this slide from my latest Servo talk</a> which shows how <a href="https://www.google.com/">google.com</a> was rendered with Servo at the beginning of 2023 vs September 2025.</p>

<li><strong>Contributors ≥ 10</strong>: average number of contributors that have merged more than 10 PRs per month.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a clarification, these numbers don’t include PRs from bots (<code>dependabot</code> and <code>Servo WPT Sync</code>).</p>
<p>Checking this we can see we are close to <strong>double the numbers from last year</strong>! The numbers in 2025 are way bigger than in the previous years (even checking the numbers from 2018-2019), showing a healthy community working on Servo.</p>



<p>The next chart is a different view of the same data but split per month, with the number of PRs landed every month, the number of contributors and the number of contributors with more than 10 patches. It shows the evolution over the years and the high activity last year.</p>

<p>The number of contributors to Servo has tripled since 2023, reaching <strong>146 different contributors in 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>If we analyze the rest of the data in this table, we can see that the percentage of contributors that do a single PR to Servo in a year has been reduced, meaning that Servo contributors are now usually doing more than one PR to the project.</p>
<p>If we check the number of contributors that have done more than 10 PRs in a year, we see the percentage almost doubling from 15% to 29% in the last 3 years.</p>
<p>And for the top contributors doing more than 100 PRs in a year, we have gone from 1 in 2023 and 3 in 2024 to 8 last year, which represent the 5% of the Servo contributors, showing a good team of very active contributors to the project.</p>

<p>You can check more information about WPT pass-rates at <a href="https://servo.org/wpt/">Servo’s website</a> (where you can also find an explanation of the <em>Score</em> number).</p>
<p>Note that these numbers differ from <a href="https://wpt.fyi/">wpt.fyi</a> because we’re still not running all the WPT tests in Servo, so the total numbers here are smaller.</p>
<p>It’s not easy to extract conclusions from this data, but it shows the Servo project keeps progressing and supporting more web platform features as time passes.</p>
<p>Sometimes these numbers grow artificially as new tests are added to WPT for features that Servo already supports (for example, the biggest jump last year was in October getting 188,281 new subtests passing without any change in Servo, just because new tests were added to WPT).</p>

<p>We are about to reach <strong>35,000 stars on GitHub</strong>. It’s good to see the project has not stopped growing since the beginning, and the curve has become steeper in recent years.</p>
<h2 id="other" tabindex="-1">Other <a href="#other">#</a></h2>
<p>If we check to the <a href="https://github.com/servo/project/blob/main/governance/README.md">official project roles</a>, we have now:</p>
<ul>
<li>5 administrators</li>
<li>17 TSC members</li>
<li>25 maintainers</li>
<li>18 contributors</li>
</ul>
<p>We have also started doing <a href="https://servo.org/blog/2025/10/20/servo-0.0.1-release/"><strong>Servo releases</strong></a>, we have done <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/releases">3 so far</a>.</p>
<p>Also the TSC has setup <a href="https://servo.org/blog/2025/11/21/sponsorship-tiers/">sponsorship tiers</a> for donations. We got <a href="https://servo.org/#acknowledgements"><strong>4 bronze sponsors</strong></a> in 2025 and we hope to increase the number of sponsorships in 2026.</p>
<p>Regarding donations, we have defined a <a href="https://github.com/servo/project/blob/main/FUNDING_REQUEST.md"><strong>funding process</strong></a> to request usage of that money. We are currently using it to sponsor <a href="https://servo.org/blog/2025/09/17/your-donations-at-work-funding-jdm/">Josh Matthews’ contributions</a>, and <a href="https://www.azabani.com/2025/12/18/shoestring-web-engine-ci.html">pay for self-hosted runners to speed up CI times</a>.</p>
<p>Servo has been present in several events last year, we ended up giving <a href="https://servo.org/about/"><strong>10 talks</strong></a> all around the globe.</p>
<h2 id="wrap-up" tabindex="-1">Wrap-up <a href="#wrap-up">#</a></h2>
<p>The idea here was to do a quick recap of the Servo stats in 2025. Taking a look at these numbers every now and then is useful, and gives you a different perspective about the status of the project, that one can easily ignore during the day-to-day tasks.</p>
<p>In general things have grown a lot in 2025, who knows what would happen in 2026, but we hope we can at least keep similar numbers or maybe even keep growing them further. That would be really great news for the Servo project.</p>
<p>Igalia is really proud of what the whole Servo community has achieved together in the recent years, and we hope for a bright future for the project going forward.</p>
<p>As an aside note, by the end of the month I’ll be at <a href="https://pretalx.fosdem.org/fosdem-2026/talk/review/PQPRDZ8DM7L8SYHBKGNZUJZUWGEXQTTP">FOSDEM talking about Servo</a>, other Servo folks like <a href="https://www.igalia.com/team/dazabani">Delan Azabani</a> and <a href="https://www.igalia.com/team/mrobinson">Martin Robinson</a> will also be there. If you are around, don’t hesitate to say hi and ask anything about the project.</p>

<p dir="auto"><strong>MBCompass</strong> is a modern, free, and open-source compass and navigation app without <strong>ads</strong>, <strong>IAP</strong>, or <strong>tracking</strong>. Built with Jetpack Compose, it supports compass and navigation features while being <strong>lightweight</strong> and simple.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Not just a compass. Not a map app.</p>
<p dir="auto">MBCompass bridges the gap between a <strong>compass</strong> and a <strong>full navigation app</strong> - shows direction and live location without using hundreds of MBs of storage or privacy trade-offs.</p>

  <p>I can’t overstate how much I hate GitHub Actions. I don’t even remember hating any other piece of technology I used. Sure, I still make fun of PHP that I remember from times of PHP4<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, but even then I didn’t <em>hate</em> it. Merely I found it subpar technology to other emerging at the time (like Ruby on Rails or Django). And yet I hate GitHub Actions.</p>
<p>With Passion<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>

<h2 id="road-to-hell">Road to Hell</h2>
<p>Day before writing these words I was implementing <code>build.rs</code> for my <a href="https://github.com/exlee/tmplr">tmplr</a> project. To save you a click - it is a file/project scaffold tool with human readable (and craftable) template files. I (personally) use it very often, given how easy it is to craft new templates, by hand or with aid of the tool, so check it out if you need a similar tool.</p>
<p>The <code>build.rs</code> used <code>CUE</code> to generate <code>README.md</code>, <code>CHANGELOG.md</code> and also a version/help file to guarantee consistency. It was fun thing to do, it took approx. 1.5h and I even <a href="https://dev.to/exlee/buildrs-ing-documentation-with-cuelang-3h2a">wrote an article</a> about it. For myself and future generations.</p>
<p>I was happy with the results and didn’t check CI output which, quite unsurprisingly, failed. I was using <code>cue</code> binary inside <code>build.rs</code> and without it build simply couldn’t progress. When I woke up next day and saw e-mail from CI notifying me about failed build I immediatelly knew my day isn’t going to start with puppies and rainbows.</p>
<p>It took couple attempts to search and push GitHub Action that would install <code>CUE</code> and then I got the worst of the worst results: One system in matrix failing to build.</p>
<p>A word of explanation. I’m building <code>tmplr</code> for 4 platforms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Linux ARM</li>
<li>macOS ARM</li>
<li>Linux x86_64</li>
<li>macOS x86_64</li>
</ul>
<p>Makes sense, right? Even though my user base can be counted on a fingers of one-arm-less and second-arm-hook-equipped pirate, it’s still a thing “One Should Do”.</p>
<p>And with all that - Linux ARM failed with “command can’t be found”. <code>CUE</code> installed and ran nicely for all other 3 targets, but for some reason it failed for Linux ARM.</p>
<p>In case you don’t care about <em>why</em> I hate GitHub but your mind started to wonder to “what went wrong” let me tell you; because I know.</p>
<p>So supposedly cross build that happens in matrix is heavily isolated. When I install <code>CUE</code> I install it only on x86_64 Linux host and macOS ARM host. macOS has zero issues running x86_64 binary and no issues are raised when Linux x86_64 tries to run x86_64 binary. But GitHub Actions is nice enough to <strong>hide</strong> x86_64 binary from arm64 runner, so that it won’t break.</p>
<p>Thank you GitHub Actions. What would’ve I done without you.</p>
<h2 id="broken-loop">Broken Loop</h2>
<p>And so my least favorite feedback loop started and went like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Search for possible fix</li>
<li>Change <code>ci.yml</code></li>
<li><code>jj squash --ignore-immutable &amp;&amp; jj git push</code> <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></li>
<li>Open “Actions” tab</li>
<li>Open latest run</li>
<li>Open Linux ARM run</li>
<li>Wait couple of seconds</li>
<li>Hate Life</li>
<li>Offer the Universe choice words it won’t soon forget</li>
<li>Rinse &amp; repeat</li>
</ol>
<p>I got quite efficient when it comes to points 8 and 9 but otherwise the whole loop still took around 2-3 minutes to execute.</p>
<p>FOR. A. SINGLE. CHANGE.</p>
<p>Yes. For a single change. Like having an editor with 2 minute save lag, pushing commit using program running on cassette tapes<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> or playing chess over snail-mail. It’s 2026 for Pete’s sake, and we<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> won’t tolerate this behavior!</p>
<p>Now of course, in some Perfect World, GitHub could have a local runner with all the bells and whistles. Or maybe something that would allow me to quickly check for progress upon the push<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> or even something like a “scratch commit”, i.e. a way that I could testbed different runs without polluting history of both Git and Action runs.</p>
<p>But no such perfect world exists and one is at the whim of heartless YAML-based system.</p>
<h2 id="breaking-off">Breaking off</h2>
<p>I suffered only 30 minutes of such loops. Could’ve done it for longer but I was out of colorful language to use and felt without it the process just isn’t the same.</p>
<p>There is a wise saying in the internet that goes like:</p>
<p><strong>For the love of all that is holy, don’t let GitHub Actions manage your logic. Keep your scripts under your own damn control and just make the Actions call them!</strong></p>
<p>This is what everyone should do. This is what I did.</p>
<p>I deleted <code>build.rs</code> (with a sliver of sadness because it was really nice - but sacrifices had to be made). I moved all the generation from <code>build.rs</code> to GNU Makefile, committed the darn files into repository, reverted changes to CI and called it a day. Problem solved.</p>
<h2 id="exit-code-0">Exit Code: 0</h2>
<p>GitHub Actions, Friends &amp; Gentlefolk, is the reason why we can’t have (some) nice things. I can’t count how many hours I’ve lost debugging the runners or trying to optimize the build process. It’s a sorry process every single time, a time that would be better spent elsewhere.</p>
<p>And yet there are some benefits, like macOS builds that would be quite hard to get otherwise. I don’t know any other system that would be easier to setup than GitHub Actions (if you know one, let me know) but it seems there’s no escape.</p>
<p>We are all doomed to GitHub Actions.</p>
<p>…but at least I dodged the bullet early.</p>

<p><a href="https://rubyonrails.org/">Rails 8</a>, the latest release of the popular web application framework based on Ruby, excised <a href="https://redis.io/">Redis</a>&nbsp;from its standard technology stack. Redis is no longer required to queue jobs, cache partials and data, and send real-time messages. Instead, Rails’s new features—<a href="https://github.com/rails/solid_queue">SolidQueue</a>&nbsp;for job queuing, <a href="https://github.com/rails/solid_cache">SolidCache</a>&nbsp;for caching, and <a href="https://github.com/rails/solid_cable">SolidCable</a>&nbsp;for transiting ActionCable messages—run entirely on your application’s existing relational database service. For most Rails applications, Redis can be discarded.</p>
<p>I know how that sounds. The Redis key-value store is fast, adept, and robust, and its reliability made it the preferred infrastructure for Rails job queueing and caching for more than a decade. Countless applications depend on Redis every day.</p>
<p>However, Redis does add complexity. SolidQueue, SolidCache, and SolidCable sparked something of an epiphany for me: <a href="https://boringtechnology.club/">boring technology</a>&nbsp;such as relational database tables can be just as capable as a specialized solution.</p>
<p>Here, let’s examine the true cost of running Redis, discover how SolidQueue works and supplants a key-value store, and learn how to use SolidQueue to migrate an application’s job queues to vanilla PostgreSQL (or SQLite or MySQL). Web development is already too complicated—let’s <em>simplify</em>.</p>
<h2 id="h.r03o9apwrc9f">The True Cost of Redis</h2>
<p>What does Redis cost beyond its monthly hosting bill? Setup and ongoing maintenance are not free. To use Redis you must:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deploy, version, patch, and monitor the server software</li>
<li><a href="https://redis.io/docs/latest/operate/oss_and_stack/management/persistence">Configure a persistence strategy</a>. Do you choose RDB snapshots, AOF logs, or both?</li>
<li>Set and watch <a href="https://redis.io/docs/latest/operate/rs/databases/memory-performance/memory-limit/)">memory limits</a>&nbsp;and establish <a href="https://redis.io/docs/latest/operate/rs/databases/memory-performance/eviction-policy">eviction policies</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to those taxes, there are other ongoing burdens to infrastructure and interoperability. You must also:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sustain network connectivity, including firewall rules, between Rails and Redis</li>
<li>Authenticate your Redis clients</li>
<li>Build and care for a high availability (HA) Redis cluster</li>
<li>Orchestrate the lifecycles of Sidekiq processes across deployments</li>
</ul>
<p>Further, when something goes wrong with a job, you’re faced with debugging Redis and your RDBMS, two data stores with very different semantics, switching context between different query languages and tools. And then there’s the issue of two separate backup strategies. (You tested them both, right?)</p>
<p>In a “Redis-less” Rails stack, things are simpler. If Rails or PostgreSQL fails, everything stops.</p>
<h2 id="h.35fl6getq7lw">How SolidQueue Works</h2>
<p>Redis is a very different data store than PostgreSQL. In many ways, Redis is treated as if it’s memory: atomic, volatile, and very fast. So how does SolidQueue manage to replace it with PostgreSQL?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/sql-select.html#sql-for-update-share">PostgreSQL 9.5</a>&nbsp;enhanced its SQL <code>FOR UPDATE</code>&nbsp;clause to add &nbsp;<code>SKIP LOCKED</code>. The <code>FOR UPDATE</code>&nbsp;clause creates an exclusive row lock. <code>SKIP LOCKED</code>&nbsp;further skips any rows currently locked. This mechanism makes running database-backed job queues viable, even at scale.</p>
<p>Here’s what happens when a worker needs a job:</p>
<pre><code>
SELECT * FROM solid_queue_ready_executions
WHERE queue_name = 'default'
ORDER BY priority DESC, job_id ASC
LIMIT 1
FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED
</code></pre>
<p>A free worker always picks up the next available job.</p>
<p>This database optimization solves the fundamental problem that plagued earlier database queue implementations: <em>lock contention</em>. A worker never waits for another and a worker never blocks. Multiple workers can query simultaneously and PostgreSQL guarantees each claims a unique job. When a worker finishes processing, it releases the lock and deletes the execution record.</p>

<p>The SolidQueue architecture centers on three tables:</p>
<ol start="1">
<li>All jobs are stored in <code>solid_queue_jobs</code>. The table persists job metadata, such as the name of the job, its Ruby class, and timestamps to record when the job started and finished. By default, every queueing request &nbsp;is recorded in this table and retained permanently, even after the job completes.</li>
<li>A scheduled job waits in <code>solid_queue_scheduled_executions</code>&nbsp;until its scheduled time arrives.</li>
<li>A job ready to run immediately is queued to solid_queue_ready_executions, where a worker &nbsp;claims it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Job tables can churn rapidly and steadily (there are hordes of inserts and deletes), but PostgreSQL’s MVCC design handles this fine with its built-in autovacuum process. No special tuning required.</p>
<p>A handful of processes coordinate this flow.</p>
<ul>
<li>Workers poll <code>solid_queue_ready_executions</code>&nbsp;at configurable intervals (as fast as 0.1 seconds for high-priority queue/se</li>
<li>Jobs are claimed and subsequently executed with <code>FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED</code>&nbsp;to control concurrency.</li>
<li>Dispatchers poll <code>solid_queue_scheduled_executions</code>&nbsp;once per second, moving due jobs into the ready table.</li>
<li>Schedulers manage recurring tasks by enqueueing jobs per defined timetables.</li>
<li>A supervisor process monitors all these, tracking heartbeats and restarting crashed processes.</li>
</ul>
<p>These separate concerns may be SolidQueue’s most elegant feature. Each process type operates on different tables with different polling intervals optimized for its workload. The processes never interfere with each other, and the database handles all coordination through vanilla transactional database semantics.</p>
<h2 id="h.sihc6y9b6bdz">Scheduling Recurring Jobs with SolidQueue</h2>
<p>Recurring jobs add to the costs inherent with Redis, as you often must integrate yet another library to schedule regular jobs. For example, assuming an application uses <a href="https://sidekiq.org/">Sidekiq</a>&nbsp;for its <a href="https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_job_basics.html">ActiveJob</a>&nbsp;adapter, <a href="https://github.com/sidekiq-cron/sidekiq-cron">sidekiq-cron</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://github.com/javan/whenever">whenever</a>&nbsp;are two popular solutions to schedule repetitive jobs.</p>
<p>Nothing supplemental is required; however, if you use SolidQueue. It includes <em>cron</em>-style recurring jobs out of the box. Simply edit <em>config/recurring.yml</em>. The configuration file should look hauntingly familiar:</p>
<pre><code>
# config/recurring.yml
production:

&nbsp; cleanup_old_sessions:
&nbsp; &nbsp; class: CleanupSessionsJob
&nbsp; &nbsp; schedule: every day at 2am
&nbsp; &nbsp; queue: maintenance

&nbsp; send_daily_digest:
&nbsp; &nbsp; class: DailyDigestJob
&nbsp; &nbsp; schedule: every day at 9am
&nbsp; &nbsp; queue: mailers

&nbsp; refresh_cache:
&nbsp; &nbsp; class: CacheWarmupJob
&nbsp; &nbsp; schedule: every hour
&nbsp; &nbsp; queue: default</code></pre>
<p>Here’s how SolidQueue’s recurring jobs work in practice.</p>
<ul>
<li>When the scheduler runs it finds the jobs due and enqueues each job to run. In the list above, for example, the task <strong>refresh_cache</strong>&nbsp;causes CacheWarmupJob&nbsp;to run at the top of each hour.</li>
<li>Concurrently, the scheduler also queues a new job to run at the time of the next occurrence in the series. Continuing the example, an hourly task that runs at 8:00 AM schedules itself to run again at 9:00 AM.</li>
<li>The 9:00 AM task schedules itself for 10:00 AM, ad infinitum.</li>
</ul>
<p>This pattern is borrowed from <a href="https://github.com/bensheldon/good_job">GoodJob</a>, another database-backed queue system. It’s crash-resistant because schedules are deterministic. “Every hour” always resolves to the top of the hour, regardless of when the scheduler process starts.</p>

<p>If you want more detail on everything SolidQueue is doing under the hood, <a href="https://blog.appsignal.com/authors/hans-j%C3%B6rg-schnedlitz.html)">Hans-Jörg Schnedlitz</a>&nbsp;over at AppSignal gives a really <a href="https://blog.appsignal.com/2025/06/18/a-deep-dive-into-solid-queue-for-ruby-on-rails.html">thorough treatment</a>&nbsp;of all its pulleys and belts.</p>
<h2 id="h.fcj9kedvqxg0">Job Concurrency: The Feature You Didn’t Know You Needed</h2>
<p>If you’ve historically used Rails at mere mortal scale, you may be unaware that Sidekiq also offers <a href="https://github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq/wiki/Ent-Rate-Limiting">concurrency limits as a paid feature</a>&nbsp;in Sidekiq Enterprise. If you’re considering using Sidekiq, concurrency limiting alone is worth the additional expense for the Enterprise edition.</p>
<p>But SolidQueue gives you this, and more, for free! Simply add <code>limits_concurrency</code>&nbsp;to any job.</p>
<pre><code>class ProcessUserOnboardingJob &lt; ApplicationJob
&nbsp; limits_concurrency to: 1, 
&nbsp; &nbsp; key: -&gt;(user) { user.id }, 
&nbsp; &nbsp; duration: 15.minutes

def perform(user)&lt;
&nbsp; &nbsp; # Complex onboarding workflow
&nbsp; end
end
</code></pre>
<p><code>limits_concurrency to: 1</code> ensures only one <code>ProcessUserOnboardingJob</code>&nbsp;job runs per user at any one time.</p>
<p>The <code>duration</code>&nbsp;parameter is also essential, as it defines how long SolidQueue guarantees the concurrency limit. If a job crashes, say, the semaphore eventually expires, preventing deadlocks caused by crashed workers that never release their locks.</p>

<p>The implementation uses two tables: <code>solid_queue_semaphores</code>&nbsp;to track concurrency limits and <code>solid_queue_blocked_executions</code>&nbsp;to hold jobs waiting for semaphore release. When a job finishes, it releases its semaphore and triggers a dispatcher to unblock the next waiting job. It’s elegant, database-native, and requires zero external coordination.</p>
<h2 id="h.7uttb9o3suc">Monitor SolidQueue with Mission Control</h2>
<p>The no-fee version of Sidekiq’s web user interface is okay. <a href="https://sidekiq.org/">Sidekiq Pro</a>&nbsp;($949/year) and Sidekiq Enterprise (starting at $1,699/year) offer enhanced dashboards.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/rails/mission_control-jobs">Mission Control Jobs</a>&nbsp;is free, open source, and designed specifically for Rails 8’s SolidQueue ecosystem:</p>
<pre><code># config/routes.rb
mount MissionControl::Jobs::Engine, at: "/jobs"</code></pre>
<p>With this single line in your routes, you now have:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Real-time” job status across all queues</li>
<li>Failed job inspection with full stack traces</li>
<li>Retry and discard controls with batch operations</li>
<li>Scheduled job timeline visualization</li>
<li>Recurring job management</li>
<li>Queue-specific metrics and throughput graphs</li>
</ul>
<p>Even better, Mission Control can inspect your database schema. When you inspect a failed job, you can see its job arguments (just like Sidekiq), but you can also query the job data with everyone’s favorite query language, SQL:</p>
<pre><code>SELECT j.queue_name, COUNT(*) as failed_count
FROM solid_queue_failed_executions fe
JOIN solid_queue_jobs j ON j.id = fe.job_id
WHERE fe.created_at &gt; NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
GROUP BY j.queue_name;</code></pre>
<p>SQL is a language you already know running in tools you already use. No external parsing. No timestamp arithmetic. Just SQL.</p>
<h2 id="h.uutpk7t1qdui">The Migration Path: From Sidekiq to SolidQueue</h2>
<p>It’s almost trivial to migrate from Sidekiq to SolidQueue.</p>
<h4 id="h.6tqlll68u3lx"><strong>Step 1: Change the Rails queue adapter</strong></h4>
<p>Rails’s queue adapter setting specifies which queuing backend is used for processing background jobs asynchronously. Set it to <code>:solid_queue</code>.</p>
<pre><code># config/environments/production.rb
config.active_job.queue_adapter = :solid_queue</code></pre>
<h4 id="h.48tk995bmllm"><strong>Step 2: Install SolidQueue</strong></h4>
<p>The SolidQueue gem must be installed separately from Rails. The gem includes two tasks to add SolidQueue’s tables to the application’s database.</p>
<pre><code>$ bundle add solid_queue
$ rails solid_queue:install
$ rails db:migrate
</code></pre>
<h4 id="h.lgvjgjkwngjq"><strong>Step 3: Replace sidekiq-cron schedules</strong></h4>
<p>Assuming you are using Sidekiq, convert your <em>config/sidekiq.yml</em>&nbsp;cron schedules to <em>config/recurring.yml</em>. The config is similarly shaped, but you’ll need to update key names and convert classic cron strings to Fugit’s preferred natural language:</p>
<pre><code># OLD: config/sidekiq.yml
:schedule:
&nbsp; cleanup_job:
&nbsp; &nbsp; cron: '0 2 * * *'
&nbsp; &nbsp; class: CleanupJob
# NEW: config/recurring.yml
production:
&nbsp; cleanup_job:
&nbsp; &nbsp; class: CleanupJob
&nbsp; &nbsp; schedule: every day at 2am</code></pre>
<h4 id="h.okb5m1d38hf6"><strong>Step 4: Update your Procfile</strong></h4>
<p>A <em>Procfile</em>&nbsp;enumerates the processes to launch on application start. To kick off SolidQueue, add the task <code>solid_queue:start</code>&nbsp;(replacing Sidekiq, say).</p>
<pre><code>web: bundle exec puma -C config/puma.rb
jobs: bundle exec rake solid_queue:start</code></pre>
<h4 id="h.kcexuaodcr9"><strong>Step 5: Blast the old stack</strong></h4>
<p>Redis and Sidekiq are now obsolete. You can remove any corresponding gems from the <em>Gemfile</em>. Run Bundler to remove the dependencies from <em>Gemfile.lock</em>.</p>
<pre><code># Gemfile - DELETE
# gem "redis"&lt;
# gem "sidekiq"
# gem "sidekiq-cron"

$ bash
$ bundle install
$ bundle clean --force
</code></pre>
<p>Your existing ActiveJob jobs work without modification. All retry strategies, error handling, and job options transfer directly.</p>
<h2 id="h.wlovlujo8ygl">When NOT To Use SolidQueue</h2>
<p>Some applications <em>need</em>&nbsp;Redis. Here are some candidates:</p>
<ul>
<li>You’re processing thousands of jobs per second sustained (not spikes, but consistent, sustained load).</li>
<li><a href="https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/use/patterns/twitter-clone">Job latency under 1ms</a>&nbsp;is critical to your business. This is a real and pressing concern for real-time bidding, high frequency trading (HFT), and other applications in the same ilk.</li>
<li>You have complex <a href="https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/interact/pubsub">pub/sub</a>&nbsp;patterns across multiple services</li>
<li>You require intensive <a href="https://redis.io/commands/incr">rate limiting or counters</a>&nbsp;that benefit from Redis’s atomic operations.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a benchmark, Shopify engineer John Duff presented some numbers at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsKXPnB6SvQ">Big Ruby 2013</a>: 833 requests/second, 72ms average response time, 53 servers with 1,172 worker processes. At that scale—twelve years ago—Shopify needed Redis-level infrastructure. Are you there yet?</p>
<p>You definitely do not need Redis if processing is less than 100 jobs/second or job latency tolerance is greater than 100ms. You may need Redis if processing 100-1000 jobs/second (test both, measure), traffic is spiky, (Black Friday sales, ticket releases), or sub-100ms job queue latency is required.</p>
<h2 id="h.89fwv929byv">Practical Implementation Guide</h2>
<p>Let’s walk through a real-world setup.</p>
<h4 id="h.z0h9xlzcbc5g"><strong>Step 1: Generate a New Rails 8 App</strong></h4>
<pre><code>$ rails new myapp --database=postgresql
$ cd myapp</code></pre>
<p>Rails 8 auto-configures SolidQueue, SolidCache, and SolidCable. You’re halfway done already.</p>
<h4 id="h.zg9fxrl7idv2"><strong>Step 2: Set Up Queue Database</strong></h4>
<p>SolidQueue needs to know where to store its tables. The recommended approach is a separate database connection (even if it’s the same physical database server).</p>
<p>Update your <em>config/database.yml</em>:</p>
<pre><code>development:
&nbsp; primary: &amp;primary_development
&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;&lt;: *default
&nbsp; &nbsp; database: myapp_development
&nbsp; queue:
&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;&lt;: *primary_development
 &nbsp; database: myapp_queue_development
&nbsp; &nbsp; migrations_paths: db/queue_migrate
</code></pre>
<p>If you’re using SQLite or MySQL, the <a href="https://github.com/rails/solid_queue#usage-in-development-and-other-non-production-environments">official SolidQueue documentation</a>&nbsp;has examples for those setups.</p>
<p>Now tell SolidQueue to use its own connection in <em>config/environments/development.rb</em>:</p>
<pre><code>Rails.application.configure do
&nbsp; config.active_job.queue_adapter = :solid_queue
&nbsp; config.solid_queue.connects_to = { database: { writing: :queue } }
end</code></pre>
<p>Run db:prepare&nbsp;and Rails handles everything automatically:</p>
<pre><code>$ rails db:prepare</code></pre>
<p>Rails creates the queue database and loads the schema. No custom rake tasks needed.</p>
<h4 id="h.pa0mbxf4u4v9"><strong>Step 3: Configure Mission Control Authentication</strong></h4>
<pre><code># config/environments/development.rb (add to existing config block)
config.mission_control.jobs.http_basic_auth_user = "dev"
config.mission_control.jobs.http_basic_auth_password = "dev"</code></pre>
<h4 id="h.r2b45yiwzwp1"><strong>Step 4: Mount Mission Control</strong></h4>
<pre><code># config/routes.rb
mount MissionControl::Jobs::Engine, at: "/jobs"</code></pre>
<h4 id="h.c01npuo8gacb"><strong>Step 5: Create Procfile.dev</strong></h4>
<pre><code>web: bin/rails server
jobs: bundle exec rake solid_queue:start</code></pre>
<h4 id="h.xbucvuurw84q"><strong>Step 6: Start Everything</strong></h4>
<pre><code># Start all the servers for Rails from the shell
$ bin/dev</code></pre>
<h2 id="h.uwzeg39z7ejc">How to Test SolidQueue</h2>
<p>Create a test job, enqueue it, and watch it in Mission Control:</p>
<pre><code># Generate a new job class from the shell
$ rails generate job EmailReport</code></pre>
<p>Open the new Ruby file and add this code.</p>
<pre><code># Job definition
class EmailReportJob &lt; ApplicationJob
&nbsp; queue_as :default
&nbsp; retry_on StandardError, wait: :exponentially_longer, attempts: 5
&nbsp; def perform(user_id)
&nbsp; &nbsp; user = User.find(user_id)
&nbsp; &nbsp; ReportMailer.weekly_summary(user).deliver_now
&nbsp; end
end</code></pre>
<p>Next, run the Rails console and queue an immediate job.</p>
<pre><code>console&gt; EmailReportJob.perform_later(User.first.id)</code></pre>
<p>While in the console, queue a scheduled job, too.</p>
<pre><code>console&gt; EmailReportJob
.set(wait: &nbsp;1.week)
.perform_later(User.first.id)</code></pre>
<p>Make it recurring in <em>config/recurring.yml</em>:</p>
<pre><code>production:
&nbsp; weekly_reports:&lt;
&nbsp; &nbsp; class: EmailReportJob
&nbsp; &nbsp; schedule: every monday at 8am
&nbsp; &nbsp; queue: mailers
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, you might want to kick over your server and visit <em>http://localhost:3000/jobs</em>&nbsp;to admire your handiwork in Mission Control Jobs.</p>
<h2 id="h.bnimljph36vz">Common Gotchas</h2>
<h4 id="h.tdrame9uyjrz"><strong>Single Database Setup (Alternative)</strong></h4>
<p>SolidQueue recommends the use of a separate database connection, but you can run everything in one database, if you prefer.</p>
<ol start="1">
<li>Copy the contents of <em>db/queue_schema.rb</em>&nbsp;into a regular migration</li>
<li>Delete <em>db/queue_schema.rb</em></li>
<li>Remove <strong>config.solid_queue.connects_to</strong>&nbsp;from your environment configs</li>
<li>Run rails db:migrate</li>
</ol>
<p>This works fine for smaller apps, but at the cost of operational flexibility. The Rails team recommends the separate connection approach. See the <a href="https://github.com/rails/solid_queue#single-database-configuration">official docs</a>&nbsp;for details.</p>
<h4 id="h.kihrnukaqm9t"><strong>Mission Control in Production</strong></h4>
<p>Don’t forget to add authentication to limit access to Mission Control in production environments! The development example uses Basic Auth, but you’ll want something more robust for production:</p>
<pre><code># config/initializers/mission_control.rb
Rails.application.configure do
&nbsp; config.mission_control.jobs.base_controller_class = 
&nbsp; &nbsp; "AdminController"
end</code></pre>
<h4 id="h.c9ykr0ue1yq7"><strong>Polling Intervals</strong></h4>
<p>The default polling interval is 1 second for scheduled jobs and 0.2 seconds for ready jobs. If you’re migrating from Sidekiq and notice jobs feel “slower,” check your expectations. In my experience, SolidQueue’s defaults work well for most applications. Sub-second latency usually doesn’t matter for background jobs.</p>
<h4 id="h.ravxl7lujbix"><strong>ActionCable and Turbo Streams</strong></h4>
<p>If you’re using ActionCable (or anything that depends on it like Turbo Streams), you’ll need to configure SolidCable with its own database connection too. Add a cable database to your database.yml:</p>
<pre><code># config/database.yml
production:
&nbsp; primary:
&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;&lt;: *default
&nbsp; &nbsp; database: myapp_production
&nbsp; cable:
&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;&lt;: *default
&nbsp; &nbsp; database: myapp_cable_production
&nbsp; &nbsp; migrations_paths: db/cable_migrate</code></pre>
<p>Then in <em>config/cable.yml</em>:</p>
<pre><code>production:
&nbsp; adapter: solid_cable
&nbsp; connects_to:
&nbsp; &nbsp; database:
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; writing: cable
&nbsp; polling_interval: 0.1.seconds
&nbsp; message_retention: 1.day</code></pre>
<h4 id="h.xrhl635f4dkm"><strong>Polling Interval</strong></h4>
<p>The polling_interval of 0.1 seconds means your ActionCable server polls the database 10 times per second—light enough for PostgreSQL to handle without breaking a sweat. This gives you 100ms latency for real-time updates, which feels plenty snappy for Turbo Streams, live notifications, or even chat.</p>
<h2 id="h.dxpb7fhjiuyb">Does it Scale</h2>
<p>You may be asking the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBwWbFpkl">timeless question</a>:</p>

<p><strong>bUT doES iT ScALe?</strong></p>
<p>The answer is yes, it scales. A better question, though, is “Does it scale enough for me?” To answer, you can start with this lovely formula from Nate Berkopec’s 2015 article <a href="https://www.speedshop.co/2015/07/29/scaling-ruby-apps-to-1000-rpm.html">“Scaling Ruby Apps to 1000 RPM”</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Required app instances = request rate (req/sec) × average response time (sec)</strong></p>
<p>Let’s do the math for a typical app. Say your app is getting 100 requests per minute, with a 200ms average response time. That’s ~1.67 requests per second. Multiply by 0.2 seconds and you get 0.083 application instances required. You need 8% of one application instance to handle your load.</p>
<p>As an anecdote, 37signals <a href="https://blog.appsignal.com/2025/06/18/a-deep-dive-into-solid-queue-for-ruby-on-rails.html">processes 20 million jobs per day</a>. That’s roughly 230 jobs per second running all on PostgreSQL sans Redis. Unless you’re processing millions of jobs per day, PostgreSQL can handle your load.</p>
<p>Here’s a side by side comparison of Redis and Sidekiq versus SolidQueue.</p>

</div>
<h2 id="h.ppt79y831p8v">The Bottom Line</h2>
<p>Redis and Sidekiq are masterfully engineered and Rails applications have benefited immeasurably from the combination for over a decade. But for most Rails apps, Redis and Sidekiq solve a problem you don’t have at a cost you can’t afford.</p>
<p>Give SolidQueue a spin. Your infrastructure simplifies, your operational burden lightens, and you can focus on building a product instead of maintaining a stack.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p id="0" data-index="0"><span>Natural language is a wonderful interface, but just because we suddenly </span><span>can </span><span>doesn't mean we always </span><span>should. </span><span>LLM inference is slow and expensive, often taking tens of seconds to complete. Natural language interfaces have orders of magnitude more latency than normal graphic user interfaces. This doesn't mean we shouldn't use LLMs, it just means we need to be smart about how we build interfaces around them.</span></p><h2 id="2" data-index="2"><span>The Latency Problem</span></h2><p id="3" data-index="3"><span>There's a classic CS diagram visualizing latency numbers for various compute operations: nanoseconds to lock a mutex, microseconds to reference memory, milliseconds to read 1 MB from disk. LLM inference usually takes 10s of seconds to complete. Streaming responses help compensate, but it's </span><span>slow.</span></p><p><img height="512" width="1024" src="https://tidepool.leaflet.pub/api/atproto_images?did=did:plc:qvywnipfiyrd6v4qdf4x27wy&amp;cid=bafkreieb5yelu7aryalqfyl36vlr4uxtw7kr2qfi2ycod3r3fpn4gao77u"></p><p id="5" data-index="5"><span>Compare interacting with an LLM over multiple turns to filling in a checklist, selecting items from a pulldown menu, setting a value on a slider bar, stepping through a series of such interactions as you fill out a multi-field dialogue. Graphic user interfaces are fast, with responses taking milliseconds, not seconds. But. But: they're not smart, they're not responsive, they don't shape themselves to the conversation with the full benefits of semantic understanding.</span></p><div id="6" data-index="6"><p><img alt="A popup dialogue with multiple conditional checkboxes, sliders, and text areas" height="523" width="903" src="https://tidepool.leaflet.pub/api/atproto_images?did=did:plc:qvywnipfiyrd6v4qdf4x27wy&amp;cid=bafkreie73h5hzlxwldypecvxfoakvb2vjwlnkeo3xfca2i56btk7pupepq"></p></div><p id="7" data-index="7"><span>This is a post about how to provide the best of both worlds: the clean affordances of structured user interfaces with the flexibility of natural language. Every part of the above interface was generated on the fly by an LLM.</span></p><h2 id="9" data-index="9"><span>Popup-MCP</span></h2><p id="10" data-index="10"><span>This is a post about a tool I made called </span><a href="https://github.com/inanna-malick/popup-mcp" target="_blank">popup-mcp</a><span> (MCP is a standardized tool-use interface for LLMs). I built it about 6 months ago and have been experimenting with it as a core part of my LLM interaction modality ever since. It's a big part of what has made me so fond of them, from such an early stage. Popup provides a single tool that when invoked spawns a popup with an arbitrary collection of GUI elements.</span></p><p id="12" data-index="12"><span>You can find popup </span><a href="https://github.com/inanna-malick/popup-mcp" target="_blank">here</a><span>, along with instructions on how to use it. It's a local MCP tool that uses stdio, which means the process needs to run on the same computer as your LLM client. Popup supports structured GUIs made up of elements including multiple choice checkboxes, drop downs, sliders, and text boxes. These let LLMs render popups like the following:</span></p><p><img height="321" width="826" src="https://tidepool.leaflet.pub/api/atproto_images?did=did:plc:qvywnipfiyrd6v4qdf4x27wy&amp;cid=bafkreiaudad7f2bb5emzzjsibxirsqmxyvu4vydvdv24szpxe6qgumhjj4"></p><p id="14" data-index="14"><span>The popup tool supports conditional visibility to allow for context-specific followup questions. Some elements start hidden, only becoming visible when conditions like 'checkbox clicked', 'slider value &gt; 7', or 'checkbox A clicked &amp;&amp; slider B &lt; 7 &amp;&amp; slider C &gt; 8' become true. This lets LLMs construct complex and nuanced structures capturing not just their next stage of the conversation but </span><span>where they think the conversation might go from there</span><span>. Think of these as being a bit like conditional dialogue trees in CRPGs like Baldur's Gate or interview trees as used in consulting. The previous dialog, for example, expands as follows:</span></p><p><img height="618" width="1148" src="https://tidepool.leaflet.pub/api/atproto_images?did=did:plc:qvywnipfiyrd6v4qdf4x27wy&amp;cid=bafkreieh3yet67ktdel4v4lq7unu6s247q5p5q37wmqyn2jcnos6wivwxm"></p><p id="16" data-index="16"><span>Because constructing this tree requires registering nested hypotheticals about how a conversation might progress, it provides a useful window into an LLM's internal cognitive state. You don't just see the question it wants to ask you, you see the followup questions it would ask based on various answer combinations. This is incredibly useful and often shows where the LLM is making incorrect assumptions. More importantly, this is </span><span>fast</span><span>. You can quickly explore counterfactuals without having to waste minutes on back-and-forth conversational turns and restarting conversations from checkpoints.</span></p><p><img height="495" width="1157" src="https://tidepool.leaflet.pub/api/atproto_images?did=did:plc:qvywnipfiyrd6v4qdf4x27wy&amp;cid=bafkreid56ezwkkrojlnrftxqpbyjvazkmv7qaiyqsjn52x337inbpwk7yi"></p><p id="19" data-index="19"><span>Speaking of incorrect LLM assumptions: every multiselect or dropdown automatically includes an 'Other' option, which - when selected - renders a textbox for the user to elaborate on what the LLM missed. This escape hatch started as an emergent pattern, but I recently modified the tool to _always_ auto-include an escape hatch option on all multiselects and dropdown menus.</span></p><p id="20" data-index="20"><span>This means that you can always intervene to </span><span>steer </span><span>the LLM when it has the wrong idea about where a conversation should go.</span></p><h2 id="22" data-index="22"><span>Why This Matters</span></h2><p id="23" data-index="23"><span>Remember how I started by talking about latency, about how long a single LLM response takes? This combination of nested dialogue trees and escape hatches cuts that by ~25-75%, depending on how well the LLM anticipates where the conversation is going. It's surprising how often a series dropdown with its top 3-5 predictions will contain your next answer, especially when defining technical specs, and when it doesn't there's always the natural-language escape hatch offered by 'Other'.</span></p><p id="25" data-index="25"><span>Imagine generating a new RPG setting. Your LLM spawns a popup with options for the 5 most common patterns, with focused followup questions for each.</span></p><p><img height="532" width="1152" src="https://tidepool.leaflet.pub/api/atproto_images?did=did:plc:qvywnipfiyrd6v4qdf4x27wy&amp;cid=bafkreieorvdy22u4m7mm7bk26rteg2u2pi777nftvwxaoerdtpoe7dd5ze"></p><p id="27" data-index="27"><span>This isn't a generic GUI; it's fully specialized using everything the LLM knows about you, your project, and the interaction style you prefer. This captures 90% of what you're trying to do, so you select the relevant options and use 'Other' escape hatches to clarify as necessary.</span></p><p><img height="697" width="1620" src="https://tidepool.leaflet.pub/api/atproto_images?did=did:plc:qvywnipfiyrd6v4qdf4x27wy&amp;cid=bafkreiboyo3ocrfgqeixutelvsztbj4f3behvjxbvcnejyinfsiaszhtcu"></p><p id="29" data-index="29"><span>These interactions have latency measured in milliseconds: when you check the 'Other' checkbox, a text box instantly appears, without even a network round-trip's worth of latency. When you're done, your answers are returned to the LLM as a JSON tool response.</span></p><p id="31" data-index="31"><span>You should think of this pattern as providing a reduction in amortized interaction latency: it'll still take 10s of seconds to produce a followup response when you submit a popup dialog, but if your average popup replaces &gt; 1 rounds of chat you're still taking less time per unit of information exchanged.  That's what I mean by amortized latency: that single expensive LLM invocation is amortized over multiple cheap interactions with deterministically rendered GUI run on your local machine.</span></p><h2 id="33" data-index="33"><span>Claude Code Planning Mode</span></h2><p id="34" data-index="34"><span>I started hacking on this a few months before Claude Code released their AskUser tool (as used in planning mode). The AskUser tool provides a limited selection of TUI (terminal user interface) elements: multiple-choice and single-choice (with an always-included ‘Other’ option) and single-choice drop-downs. I originally chose not to publicize my library because of this, but I believe the addition of conditional elements is worth talking about.</span></p><p><img height="396" width="1518" src="https://tidepool.leaflet.pub/api/atproto_images?did=did:plc:qvywnipfiyrd6v4qdf4x27wy&amp;cid=bafkreie5ayfyu6dyvhxsjjbvcabyycftya4okv6f26xndqrf45lhc3prxy"></p><p id="36" data-index="36"><span>Further, I have some feature requests for Claude Code. If anyone at Anthropic happens to be reading this these would all be pretty easily to implement:</span></p><ul><li><p id="37.0" data-index="37.0"><span>Make the TUI interface used by the AskUserQuestion tool open and scriptable, such that plugins and user code can directly modify LLM-generated TUI interfaces, or directly generate their own without requiring a round-trip through the LLM to invoke the tool.</span></p></li><li><p id="37.1" data-index="37.1"><span>Provide pre and post-AskUser tool hooks so users can directly invoke code using TUI responses (eg filling templated prompts using TUI interface responses in certain contexts).</span></p></li><li><p id="37.2" data-index="37.2"><span>Extend the AskUser tool to support conditionally-rendered elements.</span></p></li></ul><h2 id="39" data-index="39"><span>Conclusion</span></h2><p id="40" data-index="40"><span>If you have an LLM chat app you should add inline structured GUI elements with conditionally visible followup questions to reduce amortized interaction latency. If you'd like to build on my library or tool definition, or just to talk shop, please reach out. I'd be happy to help. This technique is equally applicable to OS-native popups, terminal user interfaces, and web UIs.</span></p><p id="42" data-index="42"><span>I'll be writing more here. Publishing what I build is one of my core resolutions for 2026, and I have one hell of a backlog. Watch this space.</span></p></div></div>]]></description>

<h3>Reporting Highlights</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Chokeholds:</strong> We found over 40 cases of agents using chokeholds and other moves that can block breathing. “I felt like I was going to pass out and die,” said a 16-year-old citizen.</li>



<li><strong>Former Police Are Appalled:</strong> We showed former police and immigration officials videos of incidents. They said agents are out of control. One said it’s “the kind of action which should get you fired.”</li>



<li><strong>Banned Tactics, No Punishment:</strong> There is a federal ban on chokeholds and similar tactics. But there is no sign of punishment for officers who’ve used them.</li>

<p>Immigration agents have put civilians’ lives at risk using more than their guns.</p>



<p>An agent in Houston put a teenage citizen into a chokehold, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DQUtnnViSSc/?hl=en">wrapping his arm around the boy’s neck</a>, choking him so hard that his neck had red welts hours later. A black-masked agent in Los Angeles pressed his knee into a woman’s neck while she was handcuffed; she then appeared to <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@trendy_viewz_1/video/7539167585011551501">pass out</a>. An agent in Massachusetts jabbed his finger and thumb into the neck and arteries of a young father who refused to be separated from his wife and 1-year-old daughter. The man’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy-q83KCOZw">eyes rolled back in his head and he started convulsing</a>.</p>



<p>After George Floyd’s murder by a police officer six years ago in Minneapolis — less than a mile from where an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent shot and killed Renee Good last week — police departments and federal agencies banned chokeholds and other moves that can restrict breathing or blood flow.</p>



<p>But those tactics are back, now at the hands of agents conducting President Donald Trump’s mass deportation campaign.</p>



<p>Examples are scattered across social media. ProPublica found more than 40 cases over the past year of immigration agents using these life-threatening maneuvers on immigrants, citizens and protesters. The agents are usually masked, their identities secret. The government won’t say if any of them have been punished.</p>



<p>In nearly 20 cases, agents appeared to use chokeholds and other neck restraints that the Department of Homeland Security prohibits “<a href="https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/2023-02/23_0206_s1_use-of-force-policy-update.pdf">unless deadly force is authorized</a>.”</p>




<p>About two dozen videos show officers kneeling on people’s necks or backs or keeping them face down on the ground while already handcuffed. Such tactics are not prohibited outright but are often discouraged, including by federal trainers, in part because using them for a prolonged time risks asphyxiation.</p>



<p>We reviewed footage with a panel of eight former police officers and law enforcement experts. They were appalled.</p>



<p>This is what bad policing looks like, they said. And it puts everyone at risk.</p>



<p>“I arrested dozens upon dozens of drug traffickers, human smugglers, child molesters — some of them will resist,” said Eric Balliet, who spent more than two decades working at Homeland Security Investigations and Border Patrol, including in the first Trump administration. “I don’t remember putting anybody in a chokehold. Period.”</p>



<p>“If this was one of my officers, he or she would be facing discipline,” said Gil Kerlikowske, a longtime police chief in Seattle who also served as Customs and Border Protection commissioner under President Barack Obama. “You have these guys running around in fatigues, with masks, with ‘Police’ on their uniform,” but they aren’t acting like professional police.</p>



<p>Over the past week, the conduct of agents has come under intense scrutiny after an ICE officer in Minneapolis killed Good, a mother of three. The next day, a Border Patrol agent in Portland, Oregon, <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/crime/2026/01/portland-police-responding-to-report-of-shooting-by-federal-immigration-agent.html">shot a man and woman</a> in a hospital parking lot.</p>



<p>Top administration officials rushed to defend the officers. Speaking about the agent who shot Good, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said, “This is an experienced officer who followed his training.”</p>



<p>Officials said the same thing to us after we showed them footage of officers using prohibited chokeholds. Federal agents have “followed their training to use the least amount of force necessary,” department spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said.</p>



<p>“Officers act heroically to enforce the law and protect American communities,” White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said.</p>



<p>Both DHS and the White House lauded the “utmost professionalism” of their agents.</p>



<p>Our compilation of incidents is far from complete. Just as the government does not count <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/immigration-dhs-american-citizens-arrested-detained-against-will">how often it detains citizens</a> or <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/trump-ice-smashed-windows-deportation-arrests/">smashes through vehicle windows</a> during immigration arrests, it does not publicly track how many times agents have choked civilians or otherwise inhibited their breathing or blood flow. We gathered cases by searching legal filings, social media posts and local press reports in English and Spanish.</p>



<p>Given the lack of any count over time, it’s impossible to know for certain how agents’ current use of the banned and dangerous tactics compares with earlier periods.</p>




<p>But former immigration officials told us they rarely heard of such incidents during their long tenures. They also recalled little pushback when DHS formally banned chokeholds and other tactics in 2023; it was merely codifying the norm.</p>



<p>That norm has now been broken.</p>



<h3>One of the citizens whom agents put in a chokehold was 16 years old.</h3>

<figure><img decoding="async" width="689" height="918" src="https://www.propublica.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/MOBILEV2Bazan.jpg" alt="Two men, wearing black armored vests, pin and choke a young man on the ground of a large warehouse store." srcset="https://www.propublica.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/MOBILEV2Bazan.jpg 689w, https://www.propublica.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/MOBILEV2Bazan.jpg?resize=225,300 225w, https://www.propublica.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/MOBILEV2Bazan.jpg?resize=422,562 422w, https://www.propublica.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/MOBILEV2Bazan.jpg?resize=552,735 552w, https://www.propublica.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/MOBILEV2Bazan.jpg?resize=558,743 558w, https://www.propublica.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/MOBILEV2Bazan.jpg?resize=527,702 527w" sizes="(max-width: 689px) 100vw, 689px"><figcaption><span>American citizen Arnoldo Bazan was hospitalized after being choked and pinned to the ground at a restaurant supply store in Houston during the arrest of his father nearby.</span> <span>Courtesy of the Bazan family</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Tenth grader Arnoldo Bazan and his father were getting McDonald’s before school when their car was pulled over by unmarked vehicles. Masked immigration agents started banging on their windows. As Arnoldo’s undocumented father, Arnulfo Bazan Carrillo, drove off, the terrified teenager began filming on his phone. The video shows the agents repeatedly ramming the Bazans’ car during a slow chase through the city.</p>



<p>Bazan Carrillo eventually parked and ran into a restaurant supply store. When Arnoldo saw agents taking his father violently to the ground, Arnoldo went inside too, yelling at the agents to stop.</p>



<p>One agent put Arnoldo in a chokehold while another pressed a knee into his father’s neck. “I was going to school!” the boy pleaded. He said later that when he told the agent he was a citizen and a minor, the agent didn’t stop.</p>



<p>“I started screaming with everything I had, because I couldn’t even breathe,” Arnoldo told ProPublica, showing where the agent’s hands had closed around his throat. “I felt like I was going to pass out and die.”</p>



<p>DHS’ McLaughlin accused Arnoldo’s dad of ramming his car “into a federal law enforcement vehicle,” but he was never charged for that, and the videos we reviewed do not support this claim. Our examination of his criminal history — separate from any immigration violations — found only that Bazan Carrillo pleaded guilty a decade ago to misdemeanor driving while intoxicated.</p>



<p>McLaughlin also said the younger Bazan elbowed an officer in the face as he was detained, which the teen denies. She said that Arnoldo was taken into custody to confirm his identity and make sure he didn’t have any weapons. McLaughlin did not answer whether the agent’s conduct was justified.</p>



<p>Experts who reviewed video of the Bazans’ arrests could make no sense of the agents’ actions.</p>



<p>“Why are you in the middle of a store trying to grab somebody?” said Marc Brown, a former police officer turned instructor who taught ICE and Border Patrol officers at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers. “Your arm underneath the neck, like a choking motion? No! The knee on the neck? Absolutely not.”</p>



<p>DHS revamped its training curriculum after George Floyd’s murder to underscore those tactics were out of bounds, Brown said. “DHS specifically was very big on no choking,” he said. “We don’t teach that. They were, like, hardcore against it. They didn’t want to see anything with the word ‘choke.’”</p>



<h3>After agents used another banned neck restraint — a carotid hold — a man started convulsing and passed out.</h3>

<p>In early November, ICE agents in Fitchburg, Massachusetts, stopped a young father, Carlos Sebastian Zapata Rivera, as he drove with his family. They had come for his undocumented wife, whom they targeted after she was charged with assault for allegedly stabbing a co-worker in the hand with scissors.</p>




<p>Body camera footage from the local police, obtained by ProPublica, captured much of what happened. The couple’s 1-year-old daughter began crying. Agents surrounded the car, looking in through open doors.</p>



<p>According to the footage, an agent told Zapata Rivera that if his wife wouldn’t come out, they would have to arrest him, too — and their daughter would be sent into the foster system. The agent recounted the conversation to a local cop: “Technically, I can arrest both of you,” he said. “If you no longer have a child, because the child is now in state custody, you’re both gonna be arrested. Do you want to give your child to the state?”</p>



<p>Zapata Rivera, who has a pending asylum claim, clung to his family. His wife kept saying she wouldn’t go anywhere without her daughter, whom she said was still breastfeeding. Zapata Rivera wouldn’t let go of either of them.</p>



<p>Federal agents seemed conflicted on how to proceed. “I refuse to have us videotaped throwing someone to the ground while they have a child in their hands,” one ICE agent told a police officer at the scene.</p>



<p>But after more than an hour, agents held down Zapata Rivera’s arms. One, who Zapata Rivera’s lawyer says wore a baseball cap reading “Ne Quis Effugiat” — Latin for “So That None Will Escape” — pressed his thumbs into the arteries on Zapata Rivera’s neck. The young man then appeared to pass out as bystanders screamed.</p>



<p>The technique is known as a carotid restraint. The two carotid arteries carry 70% of the brain’s blood flow; block them, and a person can quickly lose consciousness. The tactic can cause <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/2774482">strokes, seizures, brain damage — and death</a>.</p>



<p>“Even milliseconds or seconds of interrupted blood flow to the brain can have serious consequences,” Dr. Altaf Saadi, a neurologist and associate professor at Harvard Medical School, told us. Saadi said she couldn’t comment on specific cases, “but there is no amount of training or method of applying pressure on the neck that is foolproof in terms of avoiding neurologic damage.”</p>



<p>In a bystander video of Zapata Rivera’s arrest, his eyes roll back in his head and he suffers an apparent seizure, convulsing so violently that his daughter, seated in his lap, shakes with him.</p>



<figure><video controls="" poster="https://www.propublica.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Newsflare-807969-distressing-moment-man-appears-fallback_preview_maxWidth_3000_maxHeight_3000_ppi_72_embedColorProfile_true_quality_95.jpg" src="https://www.propublica.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Newsflare-807969-distressing-moment-man-appears-1_2.mp4" playsinline=""></video><figcaption><span>Video of Zapata Rivera’s arrest shows him shaking violently while suffering an apparent seizure in the front seat of his car, with officers continuing to attempt the arrest.</span> <span>Newsflare</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“Carotid restraints are prohibited unless deadly force is authorized,” DHS’ <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/2023-02/23_0206_s1_use-of-force-policy-update.pdf">use-of-force policy</a> states. Deadly force is authorized only when an officer believes there’s an “imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury” and there is “no alternative.”</p>



<p>In a social media post after the incident and in its statement to ProPublica, DHS did not cite a deadly threat. Instead, it referenced the charges against Zapata Rivera’s wife and suggested <a href="https://x.com/dhsgov/status/1986881395432820927">he had only pretended to have a medical crisis</a> while refusing help from paramedics. “Imagine FAKING a seizure to help a criminal escape justice,” the post said.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/72041374/zapata-rivera-v-unknown-federal-agent-john-doe/">“These statements were lies,”</a> Zapata Rivera alleges in an ongoing civil rights lawsuit he filed against the ICE agent who used the carotid restraint. His lawyer told ProPublica that Zapata Rivera was disoriented after regaining consciousness; the lawsuit says he was denied medical attention. (Representatives for Zapata Rivera declined our requests for an interview with him. His wife has been released on bond, and her assault case awaits trial.)</p>



<p>A police report and bodycam footage from Fitchburg officers at the scene, obtained via a public records request, back up Zapata Rivera’s account of being denied assistance. “He’s fine,” an agent told paramedics, according to footage. The police report says Zapata Rivera wanted medical attention but “agents continued without stopping.”</p>




<p>Saadi, the Harvard neurologist, said that as a general matter, determining whether someone had a seizure is “not something even neurologists can do accurately just by looking at it.”</p>



<h3>DHS policy bars using chokeholds and carotid restraints just because someone is resisting arrest. Agents are doing it anyway.</h3>

<p>When DHS issued restrictions on chokeholds and carotid restraints, it stated that the moves “must not be used as a means to control non-compliant subjects or persons resisting arrest.” Deadly force “shall not be used solely to prevent the escape of a fleeing subject.”</p>



<p>But videos reviewed by ProPublica show that agents have been using these restraints to do just that.</p>



<p>In Los Angeles in June, masked officers from ICE, Border Patrol and other federal agencies pepper-sprayed and then tackled another citizen, Luis Hipolito. As Hipolito struggled to get away, one of the agents put him in a chokehold. Another pointed a Taser at bystanders filming.</p>



<p>Then Hipolito’s body began to convulse — a possible seizure. An onlooker warned the agents, “You gonna let him die.”</p>



<figure><video controls="" poster="https://www.propublica.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/LuisHipolito-fallback_preview_maxWidth_3000_maxHeight_3000_ppi_72_embedColorProfile_true_quality_95.jpg" src="https://www.propublica.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/LuisHipolito.mp4" playsinline=""></video><figcaption><span>In the video of Hipolito’s arrest, four agents can be seen pulling at his body, choking him and pinning him to the pavement.</span> <span>@the_moxie_report</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>When officers make a mistake in the heat of the moment, said Danny Murphy, a former deputy commissioner of the Baltimore Police Department, they need to “correct it as quickly as possible.”</p>



<p>That didn’t happen in Hipolito’s case. The footage shows the immigration agent not only wrapping his arm around Hipolito’s neck as he takes him down but also sticking with the chokehold after Hipolito is pinned on the ground.</p>



<p>The agent’s actions are “dangerous and unreasonable,” Murphy said.</p>



<p>Asked about the case, McLaughlin, the DHS spokesperson, said that Hipolito was arrested for assaulting an ICE officer. Hipolito’s lawyers did not respond to ProPublica’s requests for comment.</p>



<p>According to the Los Angeles Times, Hipolito <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-06-27/are-you-gonna-let-him-die-agents-pile-on-protester-who-convulses-and-struggles-to-breathe">limped into court days after the incident</a>. Another citizen who was with him the day of the incident was also charged, but her case was dropped. Hipolito pleaded not guilty and goes to trial in February.</p>



<h3>Some of the conduct in the footage isn’t banned — but it’s discouraged and dangerous.</h3>

<p>A video from Los Angeles shows a Colombian-born TikTokker who often filmed ICE apparently <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@trendy_viewz_1/video/7539167585011551501">passed out</a> after officers <a href="https://x.com/WUTangKids/status/1956854632203878890">pulled her from her Tesla and knelt on her neck</a>. Another video shows a DoorDash driver in Portland, Oregon, <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/portland/2025/10/i-cant-breathe-man-tells-ice-agents-in-spanish-five-times-during-portland-arrest.html">screaming for air as four officers pin him face down in the street</a>. “Aire, aire, aire,”<em> </em>he says. “No puedo respirar” — I can’t breathe. Then: “Estoy muriendo”<em> </em>— I’m dying. A third video, from Chicago, <a href="https://spaces.hightail.com/space/ERClkyY4Cj/files/fi-ee68b78b-2ba0-4355-b2a1-49e1d5243c7c/fv-946d3e13-2b8d-4317-bb54-fbe69fd3ef09/2025.10.31.MP4">shows an agent straddling a citizen and repeatedly pressing his face into the asphalt</a>. Onlookers yell that the man can’t breathe.</p>



<p>Placing a knee on a prone subject’s neck or weight on their back isn’t banned under DHS’ use-of-force policy, but it can be dangerous — and the longer it goes on, the higher the risk that the person won’t be able to breathe.</p>




<p>“You really don’t want to spend that amount of time just trying to get somebody handcuffed,” said Kerlikowske, the former CPB commissioner, of the video of the arrest in Portland.</p>



<p>Brown, the former federal instructor and now a lead police trainer at the University of South Carolina, echoed that. “Once you get them handcuffed, you get them up, get them out of there,” he said. “If they’re saying they can’t breathe, hurry up.”</p>

<p>Taking a person down to the ground and restraining them there can be an appropriate way to get them in handcuffs, said Seth Stoughton, a former police officer turned law professor who also works at the University of South Carolina. But officers have long known to make it quick. By the mid-1990s, the federal government was advising officers against keeping people prolongedly in a prone position.</p>



<p>When a federal agent kneeled on the neck of an intensive care nurse in August, she said she understood the danger she was in and tried to scream.</p>



<p>“I knew that the amount of pressure being placed on the back of my neck could definitely hurt me,” said Amanda Trebach, a citizen and activist who was arrested in Los Angeles while monitoring immigration agents. “I was having a hard time breathing because my chest was on the ground.”</p>



<p>McLaughlin, the DHS spokesperson, said Trebach impeded agents’ vehicles and struck them with her signs and fists.</p>



<p>Trebach denies this. She was released without any charges.</p>

<p>In the fall, a protester in Chicago refused to stand back after a federal agent told him to do so. Suddenly, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/51miOmd1qUM">agent grabbed the man by the throat and slammed him to the ground</a>.</p>



<p>“No, no!” one bystander exclaims. “He’s not doing anything!”</p>



<p>DHS’ McLaughlin did not respond to questions about the incident.</p>



<p>Along with two <a href="https://x.com/fordfischer/status/1969150886422155594">similar</a> <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ice-throw-elderly-woman-to-the-ground_n_690271b2e4b0e763a61c8a22">choking incidents</a> at protests outside of ICE facilities, this is one of the few videos in which the run-up to the violence is clear. And the experts were aghast.</p>



<p>“Without anything I could see as even remotely a deadly force threat, he immediately goes for the throat,” said Ashley Heiberger, a retired police captain from Pennsylvania who frequently testifies in use-of-force cases. Balliet, the former immigration official, said the agent turned the scene into a “pissing contest” that was “explicitly out of control.”</p>




<p>“It’s so clearly excessive and ridiculous,” Murphy said. “That’s the kind of action which should get you fired.”</p>



<p>“How big a threat did you think he was?” Brown said, noting that the officer slung his rifle around his back before grabbing and body-slamming the protester. “You can’t go grab someone just because they say, ‘F the police.’”</p>



<h3>Roving patrols + unplanned arrests = unsafe tactics.</h3>

<p>In November, Border Patrol agents rushed into the construction site of a future Panda Express in Charlotte, North Carolina, to check workers’ papers. When one man tried to run, an officer put him in a chokehold and later marched him out, bloodied, to a waiting SUV.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/11/15/dhs-launches-operation-charlottes-web-target-criminal-illegal-aliens-terrorizing">Charlotte operation</a> was one of Border Patrol’s many forays into American cities, as agents led by <a href="https://x.com/CMDROpAtLargeCA/status/1995599514078732776?s=20">commander-at-large Gregory Bovino</a> claimed to target “criminal illegal aliens” but frequently <a href="https://x.com/CMDROpAtLargeCA/status/1995599514078732776?s=20">chased down</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuaPCS67Ii8">landscapers</a>, construction workers and <a href="https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/local/article312950879.html">U.S. citizens</a> in roving patrols through predominantly immigrant or Latino communities.</p>



<p>Freelance photographer <a href="https://www.ryanmurphyphoto.com/bio">Ryan Murphy</a>, who had been following Border Patrol’s convoys around Charlotte, documented the Panda Express arrest.</p>



<p>“Their tactics are less sophisticated than you would think,” he told ProPublica. “They sort of drive along the streets, and if they see somebody who looks to them like they could potentially be undocumented, they pull over.”</p>



<p>Experts told ProPublica that if officers are targeting a specific individual, they can minimize risks by deciding when, where and how to take them into custody. But when they don’t know their target in advance, chaos — and abuse — can follow.</p>



<p>“They are encountering people they don’t know anything about,” said Scott Shuchart, a former assistant director at ICE.</p>



<p>“The stuff that I’ve been seeing in the videos,” Kerlikowske said, “has been just ragtag, random.”</p>



<p>There may be other factors, too, our experts said, including quotas and a <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/homeland-security-crcl-civil-rights-immigration-border-patrol-trump-kristi-noem">lack of consequences amid gutted oversight</a>. With officers wearing masks, Shuchart said, “even if they punch grandma in the face, they won’t be identified.”</p>



<p>As they sweep into American cities, immigration officers are unconstrained — and, the experts said, unprepared. Even well-trained officers may not be trained for the environments where they now operate. Patrolling a little-populated border region takes one set of skills. Working in urban areas, <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/immigration-agents-detained-mistreated-citizens-congressional-investigation">where citizens — and protesters — abound</a>, takes another.</p>



<p>DHS and Bovino did not respond to questions about their agents’ preparation or about the chokehold in Charlotte.</p>




<h3>Experts may think there’s abuse. But holding officers to account? That’s another matter.</h3>

<p>Back in Houston, immigration officers dropped 16-year-old Arnoldo off at the doorstep of his family home a few hours after the arrest. His neck was bruised, and his new shirt was shredded. Videos taken by his older sisters show the soccer star struggling to speak through sobs.</p>



<p>Uncertain what exactly had happened to him, his sister Maria Bazan took him to Texas Children’s Hospital, where staff identified signs of the chokehold and moved him to the trauma unit. Hospital records show he was given morphine for pain and that doctors ordered a dozen CT scans and X-rays, including of his neck, spine and head.</p>



<p>From the hospital, Maria called the Houston Police Department and tried to file a report, the family said. After several unsuccessful attempts, she took Arnoldo to the department in person, where she says officers were skeptical of the account and their own ability to investigate federal agents.</p>



<p>Arnoldo had filmed much of the incident, but agents had taken his phone. He used Find My to locate the phone — at a vending machine for used electronics miles away, close to an ICE detention center. The footage, which ProPublica has reviewed, backed the family’s account of the chase.</p>

<p>The family says Houston police still haven’t interviewed them. A department spokesperson told ProPublica it was not investigating the case, referring questions to DHS. But the police have also not released bodycam footage and case files aside from a top sheet, citing an open investigation.</p>



<p>“We can’t do anything,” Maria said one officer told her. “What can HPD do to federal agents?”</p>



<p>Elsewhere in the country, some officials are trying to hold federal immigration officers to account.</p>



<p>In California, the state Legislature passed bills prohibiting immigration officers from wearing masks and requiring them to display identification during operations.</p>



<p>In Illinois, Gov. JB Pritzker signed a law that allows residents to sue any officer who violates state or federal constitutional rights. (The Trump administration quickly filed legal challenges against California and Illinois, claiming their new laws are unconstitutional.)</p>



<p>In Colorado, Durango’s police chief saw a recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=St5aTGJd4Rw">video of an immigration officer using a chokehold on a protester</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/03/us/politics/durango-colorado-ice-protester.html">reported it to the Colorado Bureau of Investigation</a>, which announced it was looking into the incident.</p>



<p>In Minnesota, state and local leaders are collecting evidence in Renee Good’s killing even as the federal government <a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2026/01/08/fbi-will-investigate-after-ice-agent-shoots-renee-good-in-minneapolis">cut the state out</a> of its investigation.</p>



<p>Arnoldo is still waiting for Houston authorities to help him, still terrified that a masked agent will come first. Amid soccer practice and making up schoolwork he missed while recovering, he watches and rewatches the videos from that day. The car chase, the chokehold, his own screams at the officers to leave his dad alone. His father in the driver’s seat, calmly handing Arnoldo his wallet and phone while stopping mid-chase for red lights.</p>




<p>The Bazan family said agents threatened to charge Arnoldo if his dad didn’t agree to be deported. DHS spokesperson McLaughlin did not respond when asked about the alleged threat. Arnoldo’s dad is now in Mexico.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Asked why an officer choked Arnoldo, McLaughlin pointed to the boy’s alleged assault with his elbow, adding, “The federal law enforcement officer graciously chose not to press charges.”</p>



<h3>How We Did It</h3>



<p>ProPublica journalists Nicole Foy, McKenzie Funk, Joanna Shan, Haley Clark and Cengiz Yar gathered videos via Spanish and English social media posts, local press reports and court records. We then sent a selection of these videos to eight police experts and former immigration officials, along with as much information as we could gather about the lead-up to and context of each incident. The experts analyzed the videos with us, explaining when and how officers used dangerous tactics that appeared to go against their training or that have been banned under the Department of Homeland Security’s use-of-force policy.</p>



<p>We also tried to contact every person we could identify being choked or kneeled on. In some cases, we also reached out to bystanders.</p>



<p>Research reporter Mariam Elba conducted criminal record searches of every person we featured in this story. She also attempted to fact-check the allegations that DHS made about the civilians and their arrests. Our findings are not comprehensive because there is no universal criminal record database.</p>



<p>We also sent every video cited in this story to the White House, DHS, CBP, ICE, border czar Tom Homan and Border Patrol’s Gregory Bovino. DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin provided a statement responding to some of the incidents we found but she did not explain why agents used banned tactics or whether any of the agents have been disciplined for doing so.</p>
