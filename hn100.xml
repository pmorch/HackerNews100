<p>ripgrep 15 is a new major version release of ripgrep that mostly has bug fixes,<br>
some minor performance improvements and minor new features.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In case you haven't heard of it before, ripgrep is a line-oriented search<br>
tool that recursively searches the current directory for a regex pattern.<br>
By default, ripgrep will respect gitignore rules and automatically skip<br>
hidden files/directories and binary files.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here are some highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Several bugs around gitignore matching have been fixed. This includes<br>
a commonly reported bug related to applying gitignore rules from parent<br>
directories.</li>
<li>A memory usage regression when handling very large gitignore files has been<br>
fixed.</li>
<li><code>rg -vf file</code>, where <code>file</code> is empty, now matches everything.</li>
<li>The <code>-r/--replace</code> flag now works with <code>--json</code>.</li>
<li>A subset of Jujutsu (<code>jj</code>) repositories are now treated as if they were git<br>
repositories. That is, ripgrep will respect <code>jj</code>'s gitignores.</li>
<li>Globs can now use nested curly braces.</li>
</ul>
<p>Platform support:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>aarch64</code> for Windows now has release artifacts.</li>
<li><code>powerpc64</code> no longer has release artifacts generated for it. The CI<br>
release workflow stopped working, and I didn't deem it worth my time to<br>
debug it. If someone wants this and can test it, I'd be happy to add it<br>
back.</li>
<li>ripgrep binaries are now compiled with full LTO enabled. You may notice<br>
small performance improvements from this and a modest decrease in binary<br>
size.</li>
</ul>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://datamethods.substack.com/p/sql-anti-patterns-you-should-avoid">https://datamethods.substack.com/p/sql-anti-patterns-you-should-avoid</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45626985">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p>Today, I will be talking about some of the common and high impact SQL anti-patterns I have seen from experience that can make queries and pipelines difficult to maintain, or have slower than expected performance. These issues can compound, causing erosion in trust in data, and slower query development in general.</p><p>When working with larger enterprise software, it is common to have large CASE WHEN statements translating application status codes into plain English. For example, status code 1 could mean the item is out of stock. Now imagine there are hundreds of status codes that need to be categorized after talking to a stakeholder who requested a dashboard to track item statuses in your warehouse.</p><p>Because you need to get this dashboard developed quickly, you decide to place this large CASE WHEN logic only within a view for that specific dashboard. This is an anti-pattern because now other developers will either have to copy and paste your logic or skip it entirely and use the raw status codes. Over time, this creates a huge mess. I know because I have seen it happen.</p><p>When handling large CASE WHEN statements, it is better to create a dimension table or view, ideally sourced from the landed table where the original status column is populated. This way, the logic is accessible and consistent for everyone.</p><p>In SQL server especially, it’s pretty easy to work against the index if you are not careful. </p><p>For example: WHERE UPPER(name) = ‘ABC’</p><p>Instead you should:</p><ul><li><p>query WHERE name = ‘abc’</p></li><li><p>create an indexed UPPER(name) column</p></li></ul><p>This allows the database to leverage indexes properly and prevents unnecessary full table scans.</p><p>When developing views, it is tempting to slap a SELECT * at the very end and call it a day. This is not ideal because:</p><ul><li><p>Schema evolution can break your view, which can have downstream effects</p></li><li><p>You are bringing in unnecessary columns potentially </p></li></ul><p>One of the most common mistakes I’ve seen is developers using SELECT DISTINCT as a quick way to eliminate duplicates that appear after a bad join. It’s an easy fix, but it hides a deeper problem. Usually, the duplicates exist because the join condition is incomplete or the relationship between tables isn’t truly one-to-one. Using DISTINCT might make the results look right temporarily, but it masks the root cause. This becomes a nightmare when someone later builds metrics off the same dataset and gets inconsistent counts. The correct approach is to fix the join logic itself, ensuring each relationship is properly defined before aggregation or reporting.</p><p>In larger data environments, it’s easy to fall into the trap of layering views on top of views. At first, this seems modular and organized. But over time, as more teams build their own transformations on top of existing views, the dependency chain becomes unmanageable. Performance slows down because the database has to expand multiple layers of logic each time, and debugging turns into an archaeological dig through nested queries. The fix is to flatten transformations periodically and materialize heavy logic into clean, well-defined base views or tables.</p><p>Nested subqueries are useful when you need to isolate logic or filter data when starting out on a query, but they can quickly turn into an anti-pattern when overused or deeply nested. I’ve seen queries with three or four layers of subqueries, each one filtering or aggregating the results of the previous one, totaling over 5000 lines of code. As you can imagine, this makes debugging queries pretty difficult. You should consider using CTEs instead, as they tend to be more readable.</p><p>SQL is one of those languages that looks simple on the surface but grows in complexity as teams and systems scale. Most anti-patterns don’t start as bad ideas. They come from speed, deadlines, or small shortcuts that accumulate over time. The best teams treat SQL like production code: shared, versioned, reviewed, and optimized. A few minutes spent designing for clarity upfront can save hours of rework and confusion later.</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p>I grew up learning to program in the late 1980s / early 1990s. Back then, I did not fully comprehend what I was doing and why the tools I used were impressive given the constraints of the hardware we had. Having gained more knowledge throughout the years, it is now really fun to pick up DOSBox to re-experience those programs and compare them with our current state of affairs.</p><p>This time around, I want to look at the pure text-based IDEs that we had in that era before Windows eclipsed the PC industry. I want to do this because those IDEs had little to envy from the IDEs of today—yet it feels as if we went through a dark era where we lost most of those features for years and they are only resurfacing now.</p><p>If anything, stay for a nostalgic ride back in time and a little rant on “bloat”. But, more importantly, read on to gain perspective on what existed before so that you can evaluate future feature launches more critically.</p><p>In the 1990s, almost every DOS program you ran had a full-screen Text User Interface (TUI) which sported text-based windows, drop shadows, colors, and mouse support. Here is just one example:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Lb6A!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1db3aeed-b831-49f5-a534-34d993bed81e_1264x948.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Lb6A!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1db3aeed-b831-49f5-a534-34d993bed81e_1264x948.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Lb6A!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1db3aeed-b831-49f5-a534-34d993bed81e_1264x948.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Lb6A!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1db3aeed-b831-49f5-a534-34d993bed81e_1264x948.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Lb6A!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1db3aeed-b831-49f5-a534-34d993bed81e_1264x948.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Lb6A!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1db3aeed-b831-49f5-a534-34d993bed81e_1264x948.png" width="1264" height="948" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1db3aeed-b831-49f5-a534-34d993bed81e_1264x948.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:948,&quot;width&quot;:1264,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:70830,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Lb6A!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1db3aeed-b831-49f5-a534-34d993bed81e_1264x948.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Lb6A!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1db3aeed-b831-49f5-a534-34d993bed81e_1264x948.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Lb6A!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1db3aeed-b831-49f5-a534-34d993bed81e_1264x948.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Lb6A!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1db3aeed-b831-49f5-a534-34d993bed81e_1264x948.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture></div></a><figcaption>The MS-DOS Editor (aka EDIT.COM) with one of its settings dialog open.

However, they were all so similar in how they looked like—80x25 characters didn’t leave much room for uniqueness—and how they worked that the differences didn’t really get in the way of usability and discoverability. Once you learned that the Alt key opened the menus and that Tab moved across input fields and buttons, you could navigate almost any program with ease.</p><p><span>But let’s talk about editors. MS-DOS shipped with a TUI text editor since version 5 (1991), which </span><a href="https://blogsystem5.substack.com/p/a-cli-text-editor-in-my-windows" rel="">I previously covered in a recent article</a><span> and is shown above. This editor “worked”, but it was really inconvenient for coding: you needed to exit the editor to compile and run your code, and when you re-ran the editor, you’d have to navigate back to where you were before.</span></p><p><span>“In my house”, we used something called </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borland_Sidekick" rel="">SideKick Plus</a><span> (1984), which wasn’t really a code editor: it was more of a Personal Information Management (PIM) system with a built-in notepad. The cool thing about it, however, was that it was a Terminate and Stay Resident (TSR) program, which meant that it loaded in the background and you could bring it up at any time by pressing Ctrl+Alt.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!qruF!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e3c2211-437b-4e17-b24f-8ebbc7eb53eb_1264x948.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!qruF!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e3c2211-437b-4e17-b24f-8ebbc7eb53eb_1264x948.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!qruF!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e3c2211-437b-4e17-b24f-8ebbc7eb53eb_1264x948.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!qruF!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e3c2211-437b-4e17-b24f-8ebbc7eb53eb_1264x948.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!qruF!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e3c2211-437b-4e17-b24f-8ebbc7eb53eb_1264x948.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!qruF!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e3c2211-437b-4e17-b24f-8ebbc7eb53eb_1264x948.png" width="1264" height="948" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1e3c2211-437b-4e17-b24f-8ebbc7eb53eb_1264x948.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:948,&quot;width&quot;:1264,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:65113,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!qruF!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e3c2211-437b-4e17-b24f-8ebbc7eb53eb_1264x948.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!qruF!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e3c2211-437b-4e17-b24f-8ebbc7eb53eb_1264x948.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!qruF!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e3c2211-437b-4e17-b24f-8ebbc7eb53eb_1264x948.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!qruF!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e3c2211-437b-4e17-b24f-8ebbc7eb53eb_1264x948.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>SideKick Plus' main screen after pressing Ctrl+Alt to bring it up.

This was really effective because quickly switching between code editing and building is critical for an efficient inner development loop. (And by the way, this past experience explains the design of the </span><a href="https://www.endbasic.dev/docs.html#intro-first" rel="">code editing flow in EndBASIC</a><span>. I did not implement the equivalent of Ctrl+Alt, but I’ve considered it many times.)</span></p><p><span>By this point, however, real IDEs had already existed for a few years. Turbo Pascal 1.0 (1983) shows the beginning of an integrated experience, although it did not feature its iconic TUI yet. QuickBASIC 2.0 (1986) shows more of a “traditional” TUI (the same as </span><code>EDIT.COM</code><span>, because they are the same editor), and MS-DOS 5 came with QBasic, a reduced version of QuickBASIC that didn’t allow compiling to native code but that had the same look.</span></p><p>The crown jewel of IDEs, in my opinion, were the later Borland Turbo series, which included Turbo C++ (1990), Turbo Assembler and Turbo Pascal. These IDEs were language specific, but they had full-screen TUIs and were extremely powerful.</p><p>Here, take a look at what we had.

printf.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Remember: all of this in the early 1990s—a little over 30 years ago at the time of this writing.</p><p><span>I was an avid user of Turbo C++, with which I learned a lot. I remember using their </span><code>conio.h</code><span> libraries to implement TUIs of my own, and then their builtin </span><code>graphics.h</code><span> libraries to play with implementing GUIs. And note: this was </span><em>without the Internet</em><span>. There was no option for many to just “look up how things worked” in Stack Overflow: the IDE had to be discoverable right away (which it was) and self-contained to offer you a complete development experience.</span></p><p>Now take a moment to compare this scene with Linux in the early 1990s.</p><p><span>In Linux, almost every program was </span><em>also</em><span> text based, but those programs did not come with a full-screen TUI. It just wasn’t “the Unix way”. I remember watching the X11 configuration tool (</span><code>XF86Setup</code><span>) or the OpenBSD installer and feeling shocked by how simplistic those were: me, a young teenager with barely any “real” coding experience, had written better-looking programs already.</span></p><p><span>In any case, this didn’t stop me from my quest to </span><em>not</em><span> use Windows. I continued to learn the ways of Linux and soon faced the “best” editors recommended by every book and community online: Vim and Emacs. And I could not understand why they were praised. Using these was like stepping back into the past. They were full-screen programs indeed, but they seemed pretty arcane. Vim did have syntax highlighting but it was far from being an IDE. Emacs could be configured to integrate with some code assisting features and the like, but it was far from being “fire and forget” like the Turbo family of IDEs.</span></p><p><span>Just look at the default Emacs configuration </span><em>today</em><span>, which hasn’t changed much (if at all) since then. It does have windows, but they aren’t decorated. It didn’t have colors (and now barely has), because why? It didn’t use to have mouse support. It </span><em>does</em><span> have a menu bar though, but it is just a gimmick? If you press M-` as the instructions tell you, you face a truly strange interface to navigate the menu—which makes one wonder why they even bothered to waste a full line of screen real state to show a menu bar that does nothing.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wWzZ!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe7d6424f-498d-4ded-94d6-76cd5205d563_973x650.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wWzZ!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe7d6424f-498d-4ded-94d6-76cd5205d563_973x650.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wWzZ!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe7d6424f-498d-4ded-94d6-76cd5205d563_973x650.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wWzZ!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe7d6424f-498d-4ded-94d6-76cd5205d563_973x650.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wWzZ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe7d6424f-498d-4ded-94d6-76cd5205d563_973x650.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wWzZ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe7d6424f-498d-4ded-94d6-76cd5205d563_973x650.png" width="973" height="650" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e7d6424f-498d-4ded-94d6-76cd5205d563_973x650.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:650,&quot;width&quot;:973,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:127463,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wWzZ!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe7d6424f-498d-4ded-94d6-76cd5205d563_973x650.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wWzZ!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe7d6424f-498d-4ded-94d6-76cd5205d563_973x650.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wWzZ!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe7d6424f-498d-4ded-94d6-76cd5205d563_973x650.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wWzZ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe7d6424f-498d-4ded-94d6-76cd5205d563_973x650.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>A fresh installation of Emacs in the console, with the standard welcome screen in the background and the "menu" open after pressing M-`.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Now try giving this to anyone with little coding experience and getting them to create, compile, and debug a program.

In fact, it feels like during these 30 years, we regressed in many ways, and only now are reaching feature parity with some of the features we used to have.</span></p><p><span>It is natural that TUIs diminished in popularity once graphical OSes gained traction, and it is somewhat interesting that they are making a comeback just now. As for why, I think we have to thank the invention of </span><a href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/" rel="">LSP</a><span> for most of the recent progress in this area. TUI editors were “on hold” for many years because building IDE features for them was a lot of effort and their small maintainer base could not afford to implement them. LSP unlocked access to existing language-specific integrations and reinfused interest in the old-and-trusty Vim and Emacs. Hopefully, the upcoming </span><a href="https://build-server-protocol.github.io/" rel="">BSP</a><span> will do even more to make these TUIs more IDE-like.</span></p><p>It is fair to ask “Who cares? Every desktop and laptop runs a graphical OS now!”</p><p><span>And it’s a good question. In general, you probably </span><em>don’t</em><span> want a TUI IDE. If VSCode is your jam, its remoting abilities are superb and VSCode has a reasonably good graphical interface without being a full-blown IDE. But there are a few things that VSCode doesn’t give us.</span></p><p><span>The first is that a TUI IDE is excellent for work on remote machines—even better than VSCode. You can SSH into </span><em>any</em><span> machine with ease and launch the IDE. </span><a href="https://jmmv.dev/2015/09/my-coding-workflow.html" rel="">Combine it with tmux and you get “full” multitasking.</a><span> Yes, you could instead use a remote desktop client instead of SSH, but I’ve always found them clunky due to lag and the improper integration with the local desktop shortcuts.</span></p><p><span>The second is that </span><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/faq#_why-arent-the-remote-development-extensions-or-their-components-open-source" rel="">VSCode’s remote extensions are </a><em><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/faq#_why-arent-the-remote-development-extensions-or-their-components-open-source" rel="">not</a></em><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/faq#_why-arent-the-remote-development-extensions-or-their-components-open-source" rel=""> open source</a><span>, which isn’t a major problem… except for the fact that they don’t work on, say, FreeBSD and there is no way to fix them. So this makes it impossible for me to remote into my primary development server with VSCode.</span></p><p>And the third is… reduced resource consumption.</p><p>I can’t leave without ranting about “bloat” for a little bit. Borland Turbo C++, with all its bells and whistles (the UI, the C++ toolchain, the integrated manuals…), is less than 9 MB after installation and ran within 640kb of RAM.</p><p>For comparison, Helix is 16 MB on disk, which is pretty impressive (and honestly unexpected), but Doom Emacs is about 500 MBs and consumes many MBs of RAM. Note, however, that none of these numbers account for the language toolchains or help systems, and toolchains nowadays rank in the GBs of disk space.</p><p>To get “real” IDEs, we have to jump to graphical programs like IntelliJ or VSCode. VSCode, for example, is about 350 MBs on disk (surprisingly less than Doom Emacs) but it will eat your computer for lunch: it’s Electron after all. I have noticed very significant savings in laptop battery life by dropping VSCode and moving to Doom Emacs.</p><p><span>So the question I want to part with is: have we advanced </span><em>much</em><span> in 30 years? Modern IDEs have some better refactoring tools, better features, and support more languages, but fundamentally… they haven’t changed much. The only major difference that we are </span><em>starting</em><span> to see might be AI-assisted coding, but this is a feature mostly provided by a remote service, not even by the installed code!</span></p><p><span>And that’s all for today. On my side, I’ll happily continue using </span><em>all of</em><span> Doom Emacs, Vim, VSCode, and IntelliJ depending on the situation. Merry Christmas if this is your thing!</span></p></div></article></div><div id="discussion"><h4>Discussion about this post</h4></div></div>]]></description>

<p dir="auto">This repository contains an Arduino-Library to create a StageConnect device (subordinated node-device as well as controlling main-device) using AnalogDevices AD242x-ICs like the AD2428.</p>
<p dir="auto">StageConnect is based on the automotive A²B and is used to connect the Behringer WING to the Midas DP48, for instance. Analog Devices <a href="https://www.analog.com/en/solutions/a2b-audio-bus.html" rel="nofollow">A²B audio</a> bus is used as the technology basis and uses simple XLR connectors between two devices to transmit 32 channels of uncompressed 48kHz 32bit audio.</p>
<p dir="auto">A StageConnect/A2B main-device uses a virtual I2C-connection through the A2B-link that is routed via the AD242x-IC to the Arduino microcontroller.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Usage</h2><a id="user-content-usage" aria-label="Permalink: Usage" href="#usage"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Include the main-library as well as the I2C-Wrapper-Class, instantiate both classes and setup the Wire-library:</p>

<p dir="auto">stageConnect.update() should be then called every 100ms.</p>
<p dir="auto">Have a look into the example-sketch to learn how to use the callbacks and the mailbox-system to receive channel-names from the host-device.</p>
<p dir="auto">For electrical connection have a look at the following picture showing the connection with the AD2428MINI evaluation board:

<p dir="auto">Analog Devices suggests cable-length of up to 15 meters, while Behringer allows longer cables. The filter-network of the AD242x-chips is quite tricky and needs caution on adjusting the hardware-parameters. Use the schematics of the AD2428MINI as a reference.</p>
<p dir="auto">Read the files in the folder "Documentation" for more information about the configuration-options and technical details regarding the brand- and product-ID as well as the specific commands for the mailbox-system.</p>
<p dir="auto">Please use brand-IDs above 0x80 to prevent interference with other products.</p>

This is an APU designed to be a true all-in-one mobile processor, able to handle high end CPU and GPU workloads without compromise. Offering a TDP range of 55W to 120W, the chip targets a far higher power envelope compared to standard Strix Point, but eschews the need for dedicated graphics.</p><p>To get y’all all caught up on the history and specifications of this APU, AMD first announced Strix Halo at CES 2025 earlier this year to much fanfare. Strix Halo is AMD’s first chiplet APU in the consumer market with AMD using Strix Halo as a bit of a show piece for what both CPU and GPU performance can look like with a sufficiently large APU.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-bvE!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa9060b1d-2fda-47a7-8bb8-2fd447f602d0_393x330.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-bvE!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa9060b1d-2fda-47a7-8bb8-2fd447f602d0_393x330.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-bvE!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa9060b1d-2fda-47a7-8bb8-2fd447f602d0_393x330.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-bvE!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa9060b1d-2fda-47a7-8bb8-2fd447f602d0_393x330.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-bvE!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa9060b1d-2fda-47a7-8bb8-2fd447f602d0_393x330.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-bvE!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa9060b1d-2fda-47a7-8bb8-2fd447f602d0_393x330.png" width="393" height="330" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a9060b1d-2fda-47a7-8bb8-2fd447f602d0_393x330.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:330,&quot;width&quot;:393,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-bvE!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa9060b1d-2fda-47a7-8bb8-2fd447f602d0_393x330.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-bvE!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa9060b1d-2fda-47a7-8bb8-2fd447f602d0_393x330.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-bvE!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa9060b1d-2fda-47a7-8bb8-2fd447f602d0_393x330.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-bvE!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa9060b1d-2fda-47a7-8bb8-2fd447f602d0_393x330.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>AMD’s Strix Halo can be equipped with dual 8 core Zen 5 CCDs for a total of 16 cores that feature the same 512b FPU as the desktop parts. This is a change from the more mainstream and monolithic Strix Point APU which has “double-pumped” 256b FPUs similar to Zen 4 for use with AVX512 code. What is similar to the more mainstream Strix Point is the same 5.1GHz max boost clock which is a 600MHz deficit compared to the desktop flagship Zen 5 CPU, the Ryzen 9 9950X.</p><p>Moving to the 3rd die on a Strix Halo package, a RDNA 3.5 iGPU takes up the majority of the SoC die with 40 compute units, 32MB of Infinity Cache, and a boost clock of up to 2.9GHz placing raw compute capability somewhere between the RX 7600 XT and RX 7700.</p><p>To feed this chip, AMD has equipped Strix Halo with a 256b LPDDR5X-8000 memory bus, which provides up to 256GB/s shared between all of the components. This is slightly lower than the 288GB/s available to the RX 7600 XT but is much higher than any other APU we have tested.</p><p><span>A massive thank you to both </span><a href="https://rog.asus.com/laptops/rog-flow/rog-flow-z13-2025/" rel="">Asus</a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.hp.com/us-en/workstations/zbook-ultra.html" rel="">HP</a><span> for sending over a </span><a href="https://rog.asus.com/laptops/rog-flow/rog-flow-z13-2025/" rel="">ROG Flow Z13 (2025)</a><span> and a </span><a href="https://www.hp.com/us-en/workstations/zbook-ultra.html" rel="">ZBook Ultra G1a 14”</a><span> for testing which were both equipped with an </span><a href="https://www.amd.com/en/products/processors/laptop/ryzen/ai-300-series/amd-ryzen-ai-max-plus-395.html" rel="">AMD Ryzen AI Max+ 395</a><span>.

However, as you can see the CPU does not have access to the 32MB of Infinity Cache on the IO die.

with reads being no slouch at 124GB/s across both CCDs.</p><p>However, looking at the bandwidth of a single CCD and just like the desktop CPUs a single Strix-Halo CCD only has a 32 byte per cycle read link to the IO die. And just like the desktop chips, the chip to chip link runs at ~2000MHz, which caps out the single CCD read at 64GB/s. Unlike the desktop chips, the write link is 32 bytes per cycle and we are seeing about 43GB/s for the write bandwidth. That brings the total theoretical single CCD bandwidth to 128GB/s and the observed bandwidth is just over 103GB/s.</p><p>The performance of Strix Halo’s CPU packs quite a bit more of a punch than Strix Point’s CPU.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Z6Dv!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F69ab58b0-4d2e-4427-a4f7-8bd2ade7f177_702x466.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Z6Dv!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F69ab58b0-4d2e-4427-a4f7-8bd2ade7f177_702x466.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Z6Dv!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F69ab58b0-4d2e-4427-a4f7-8bd2ade7f177_702x466.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Z6Dv!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F69ab58b0-4d2e-4427-a4f7-8bd2ade7f177_702x466.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Z6Dv!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F69ab58b0-4d2e-4427-a4f7-8bd2ade7f177_702x466.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Z6Dv!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F69ab58b0-4d2e-4427-a4f7-8bd2ade7f177_702x466.png" width="702" height="466" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/69ab58b0-4d2e-4427-a4f7-8bd2ade7f177_702x466.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:466,&quot;width&quot;:702,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Z6Dv!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F69ab58b0-4d2e-4427-a4f7-8bd2ade7f177_702x466.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Z6Dv!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F69ab58b0-4d2e-4427-a4f7-8bd2ade7f177_702x466.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Z6Dv!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F69ab58b0-4d2e-4427-a4f7-8bd2ade7f177_702x466.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Z6Dv!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F69ab58b0-4d2e-4427-a4f7-8bd2ade7f177_702x466.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Strix Halo’s CPU can match a last generation desktop flagship CPU, the 7950X, in Integer performance despite a 11.7% clock speed delta.

Overall the two provide a comparable experience in Cyberpunk 2077, with changes in settings or power limits adjusting the lead between the two. This is a seriously impressive turnaround for an iGPU working against dedicated graphics, and demonstrates the versatility of the chip in workloads like gaming, where iGPU’s have traditionally struggled.</p><p>Strix Halo follows in the footsteps of many other companies in the goal of designing an SoC for desktop and laptop usage that is truly all encompassing. The CPU and GPU performance is truly a class above standard low power laptop chips, and is even able to compete with larger systems boasting dedicated graphics. CPU performance is especially impressive with a comparable showing to the desktop Zen 5 CPUs. GPU performance is comparable to mid range dedicated graphics, while still offering the efficiency and integration of an iGPU. High end dedicated graphics still have a place above Strix Halo, but the versatility of this design for smaller form factor devices is class leading.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SrML!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff3e47456-dd28-42b7-90b6-4d2415364c5e_1600x1008.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SrML!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff3e47456-dd28-42b7-90b6-4d2415364c5e_1600x1008.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SrML!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff3e47456-dd28-42b7-90b6-4d2415364c5e_1600x1008.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SrML!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff3e47456-dd28-42b7-90b6-4d2415364c5e_1600x1008.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SrML!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff3e47456-dd28-42b7-90b6-4d2415364c5e_1600x1008.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SrML!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff3e47456-dd28-42b7-90b6-4d2415364c5e_1600x1008.png" width="1456" height="917" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f3e47456-dd28-42b7-90b6-4d2415364c5e_1600x1008.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:917,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SrML!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff3e47456-dd28-42b7-90b6-4d2415364c5e_1600x1008.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SrML!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff3e47456-dd28-42b7-90b6-4d2415364c5e_1600x1008.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SrML!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff3e47456-dd28-42b7-90b6-4d2415364c5e_1600x1008.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SrML!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff3e47456-dd28-42b7-90b6-4d2415364c5e_1600x1008.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption><a href="https://rog.asus.com/laptops/rog-flow/rog-flow-z13-2025/" rel="">Asus ROG Flow Z13 2025</a><span> which is a very similar form factor to the Microsoft Surface but has a Strix Halo inside of it instead of a lower power Intel chip.

I was hoping to have a section dedicated to the ML performance of Strix Halo in this article, however AMD only just released preview support for Strix Halo in the ROCm 7.0.2 release which came out about a week ago from time of publication. As a result of the long delay between the launch of Strix Halo and the release of ROCm 7.0.2, the ML performance will have to wait until a future article.</p><p>However, putting aside ROCm, Strix Halo is a very, very cool piece of technology and I would love to see successors to Strix Halo with newer CPU and GPU IP and possibly even larger memory buses similar to Apple’s Max and Ultra series of SoCs with 512b and 1024b memory respectively. AMD has a formula for building bigger APUs with Strix Halo, which opens the door to a lot of interesting hardware possibilities in the future.</p><p><span>If you like the content then consider heading over to the </span><a href="https://www.patreon.com/ChipsandCheese" rel="">Patreon</a><span> or </span><a href="https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=4EMPH66SBGVSQ" rel="">PayPal</a><span> if you want to toss a few bucks to Chips and Cheese.

<p>Law enforcement agencies will soon have easier access to footage captured by Amazon’s Ring smart cameras. In a partnership announced this week, Amazon will allow approximately 5,000 local law enforcement agencies to request access to Ring camera footage via surveillance platforms from <a href="https://www.flocksafety.com/">Flock Safety</a>. Ring cooperating with law enforcement and the reported use of Flock technologies by federal agencies, including US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), has resurfaced privacy concerns that have followed the devices for years.</p>
<p>According to Flock’s announcement, its Ring partnership allows local law enforcement members to use Flock software “to send a direct post in the Ring Neighbors app with details about the investigation and request voluntary assistance.” Requests must include “specific location and timeframe of the incident, a unique investigation code, and details about what is being investigated,” and users can look at the requests anonymously, Flock said.</p>
<p>“Any footage a Ring customer chooses to submit will be securely packaged by Flock and shared directly with the requesting local public safety agency through the FlockOS or Flock Nova platform,” the announcement reads.</p>
<p>Flock said its local law enforcement users will gain access to Ring Community Requests in “the coming months.”</p>
<h2>A flock of privacy concerns</h2>
<p>Outside its software platforms, Flock is known for <a href="https://www.flocksafety.com/ebooks/license-plate-reader-cameras-overview">license plate recognition cameras</a>. Flock customers can also <a href="https://www.flocksafety.com/products/flock-freeform#:~:text=Most%20tools%20rely%20on%20rigid,to%20find%20visual%20matches%20instantly.'">search</a> footage from Flock cameras using descriptors to find people, such as “man in blue shirt and cowboy hat.” Besides law enforcement agencies, Flock says 6,000 communities and 1,000 businesses use their products.</p>
<p>For years, privacy advocates have warned against companies like Flock.</p>
<p>This week, US Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) sent a letter <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/wyden_letter_to_flock.pdf">[PDF]</a> to Flock CEO Garrett Langley saying that ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), the Secret Service, and the US Navy’s Criminal Investigative Service have had access to footage from Flock’s license plate cameras.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>“I now believe that abuses of your product are not only likely but inevitable and that Flock is unable and uninterested in preventing them,” Wyden wrote.</p>
<p>In August, Jay Stanley, senior policy analyst for the ACLU Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project, <a href="https://www.aclu.org/news/privacy-technology/flock-roundup">wrote</a> that “Flock is building a dangerous, nationwide mass-surveillance infrastructure.” Stanley pointed to <a href="https://www.404media.co/ice-taps-into-nationwide-ai-enabled-camera-network-data-shows/">ICE using</a> Flock’s network of cameras, as well as Flock’s efforts to build a <a href="https://www.404media.co/license-plate-reader-company-flock-is-building-a-massive-people-lookup-tool-leak-shows/">people lookup tool</a> with data brokers.</p>
<p>Matthew Guariglia, senior policy analyst at the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), told Ars via email that Flock is a “mass surveillance tool” that “has increasingly been used to spy on both immigrants and people exercising their First Amendment-protected rights.”</p>
<p>Flock has earned this reputation among privacy advocates through its own cameras, not Ring’s.</p>
<p>An Amazon spokesperson told Ars Technica that only local public safety agencies will be able to make Community Requests via Flock software, and that requests will also show the name of the agency making the request.</p>
<p>A Flock spokesperson told Ars:</p>
<blockquote><p>Flock does not currently have any contracts with any division of [the US Department of Homeland Security], including ICE. The Ring Community Requests process through Flock is only available for local public safety agencies for specific, active investigations. All requests are time and geographically-bound. Ring users can choose to share relevant footage or ignore the request.</p></blockquote>
<p>Flock’s rep added that all activity within FlockOS and Flock Nova is “permanently recorded in a comprehensive CJIS-compliant audit trail for unalterable custody tracking,” referring to a set of standards created by the FBI’s <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/services/cjis">Criminal Justice Information Services</a> division.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>But there’s still concern that federal agencies will end up accessing Ring footage through Flock. Guariglia told Ars:</p>
<blockquote><p>Even without formal partnerships with federal authorities, data from these surveillance companies flow to agencies like ICE through local law enforcement. Local and state police have run more than 4,000 Flock searches on behalf of federal authorities or with a potential immigration focus,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.404media.co/ice-taps-into-nationwide-ai-enabled-camera-network-data-shows/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.404media.co/ice-taps-into-nationwide-ai-enabled-camera-network-data-shows/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1760807427153000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3c_dUFIaqOJutylG4zjHu0">reporting has found</a>. Additionally, just this month, it became clear that Texas police searched&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/10/flock-safety-and-texas-sheriff-claimed-license-plate-search-was-missing-person-it" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/10/flock-safety-and-texas-sheriff-claimed-license-plate-search-was-missing-person-it&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1760807427153000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0I2Yt8eYfc6vO0usQ4AwxA">83,000 Flock cameras</a> in an attempt to prosecute a woman for her abortion and then tried to cover it up.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Ring cozies up to the law</h2>
<p>This week’s announcement shows Amazon, which acquired Ring in 2018, increasingly positioning its consumer cameras as a law enforcement tool. After years of <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/cops-offering-ring-doorbell-cameras-for-information/">cops using Ring footage</a>, Amazon last year said that it would <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/01/amazon-ring-stops-letting-cops-get-doorbell-footage-without-a-warrant/">stop letting police request Ring footage</a>—unless it was an “emergency”—only to reverse course about 18 months later by allowing police to request Ring footage through a Flock rival, <a href="https://www.axon.com/newsroom/press-releases/axon-announces-new-fixed-ALPR-camera-solutions-and-next-gen-AI-advancements-to-expand-real-time-public-safety-ecosystem">Axon</a>.</p>
<p>While announcing Ring’s deals with Flock and Axon, Ring founder and CEO Jamie Siminoff claimed that the partnerships would help Ring cameras keep neighborhoods safe. But there’s doubt as to whether people buy Ring cameras to protect their neighborhood.</p>
<p>“Ring’s new partnership with Flock shows that the company is more interested in contributing to mounting authoritarianism than servicing the specific needs of their customers,” Guariglia told Ars.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Ring initiated conversations about a deal with Flock, Langely told <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/16/amazon-ring-cameras-surveillance-law-enforcement-crime-police-investigations.html">CNBC</a>.</p>
<p>Flock says that its cameras don’t use facial recognition, which has been criticized for <a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/unmasking-bias-facial-recognition-algorithms">racial biases</a>. But local law enforcement agencies using Flock will soon have access to footage from Ring cameras with facial recognition. In a conversation with <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/10/03/amazon-ring-doorbell-facial-recognition-pricacy/">The Washington Post</a> this month, Calli Schroeder, senior counsel at the consumer advocacy and policy group Electronic Privacy Information Center, described the new feature for Ring cameras as “invasive for anyone who walks within range of” a Ring doorbell, since they likely haven’t consented to facial recognition being used on them.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>Amazon, for its part, has mostly pushed the burden of ensuring responsible facial recognition use to its customers. Schroeder shared concern with the Post that Ring’s facial recognition data could end up being shared with law enforcement.</p>
<p>Some people who are perturbed about Ring deepening its ties with law enforcement have complained online.</p>
<p>“Inviting big brother into the system. Screw that,” a user on the Ring subreddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Ring/comments/1o8jl9u/amazons_ring_to_partner_with_flock_a_network_of/">said</a> this week.</p>
<p>Another Reddit user said: “And… I’m gone. Nope, NO WAY IN HELL. Goodbye, Ring. I’ll be switching to a UniFi[-brand] system with 100 percent local storage. You don’t get my money any more. This is some <em>1984</em> BS …”</p>
<p>Privacy concerns are also exacerbated by Ring’s past, as the company has previously <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/12/ring-used-parties-swag-to-build-700-police-partnerships-report-finds/">failed to meet users’ privacy expectations</a>. In 2023, Ring agreed to pay $5.8 million to settle claims that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/06/ftc-amazon-ring-workers-illegally-spied-on-users-of-home-security-cameras/">employees illegally spied on Ring customers</a>.</p>
<p>Amazon and Flock say their collaboration will only involve voluntary customers and local enforcement agencies. But there’s still reason to be concerned about the implications of people sending doorbell and personal camera footage to law enforcement via platforms that are reportedly widely used by federal agencies for deportation purposes. Combined with the privacy issues that Ring has already faced for years, it’s not hard to see why some feel that Amazon scaling up Ring’s association with any type of law enforcement is unacceptable.</p>
<p>And it appears that Amazon and Flock would both like Ring customers to opt in when possible.</p>
<p>“It will be turned on for free for every customer, and I think all of them will use it,” Langely told CNBC.</p>

                    <p>Forget that! Who would ever want to put in all of that effort to understand what they're building? Just open up your browser and type "make me a website" into Claude or ChatGPT, and you're on your way! There are hundreds of identical prompts to choose from, but go ahead and use the same exact one everyone else uses, paste the output without reading it, and you're done! No one will notice that every AI-coded site looks identical! Plus you get to argue on Twitter about whether "prompt engineering" counts as real programming!</p>

                    <p>Here's my contact info because that's what Claude suggested when I prompted "make me a website". Can't wait for all the recruiters asking if I "really know how to code" or if I just prompt stuff. Of course I know how to code! I can write a mean ChatGPT prompt!</p>
                    <p>This site was built in 5 minutes by asking Claude "make me a website" and I'm very proud of myself.</p>
                    <p>No, I did not read any of the code. Yes, it works. No, I cannot explain how. Yes, I will put "Full Stack Developer" on my resume.</p>

<p dir="auto">WebMCP allows websites to share tools, resources, prompts, etc. to LLMs. In other words, WebMCP allows a website to be an MCP server. No sharing API Keys. Use any model you want.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://webmcp.dev/" rel="nofollow">Here's a simple website I built that is WebMCP-enabled</a></p>
<p dir="auto">It comes in the form of a widget that a website owner can put on their site and expose tools to give client-side LLMs what they need to provide a great UX for the user or agent.</p>
<p dir="auto"><em>The look, feel, how it's used, and security are all absolutely open for contribution / constructive criticism. MCP Clients directly building WebMCP functionality seems like an ideal outcome.</em></p>
<p dir="auto">An end-user can connect to any number of websites at a time - and tools are "scoped" (by name) based on the domain to simplify organization.</p>

<p dir="auto">When you're ready to connect to a website, you can ask your model to generate you an mcp token.</p>
<p dir="auto">Copy the token and paste it to the website's input. As soon as the website registers with it, it's thrown away and cannot be used for subsequent registrations or anything else. The website will receive its own session token for making requests.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you'd rather your model / service never see the token, you can manually execute <code>npx @jason.today/webmcp --new</code> instead.</p>
<p dir="auto">Some MCP clients, including Claude Desktop, need to be restarted to get access to new tools. (at least at time of writing)</p>
<p dir="auto">To disconnect, you can close the browser tab, click "disconnect", or shut down the server with <code>npx @jason.today/webmcp -q</code>.</p>

<p dir="auto">The bridge between the MCP client and the website is a localhost-only (not accessible to requests outside your computer) websocket server. Because it is configured to allow requests from your local web browser, authentication / token exchange is required, in case you visit a website attempting to abuse this.</p>
<p dir="auto"><em>Ideally the web browser itself would have an explicit permission for this, like webcam or microphone use.</em></p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>The MCP client connects to the <code>/mcp</code> path using the server token from <code>.env</code> (auto-generated)</li>
<li>The server generates a registration token (instigated via the built-in mcp tool by a model or the <code>--new</code> command)</li>
<li>Web clients connect to the <code>/register</code> endpoint with this token and its domain.</li>
<li>Web pages connect to their assigned channel based on their domain.</li>
<li>When an LLM wants to use a tool / resource / prompt, the request flows from:
<ul dir="auto">
<li>MCP Client → MCP Server → WebSocket Server → Web Page with the tool / resource / prompt</li>
<li>(similar for requesting a list of tools / resources / prompts)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The web page performs the request (e.g. call tool) and sends the result back through the same path</li>
<li>Multiple web pages can be connected simultaneously, each with their own set of tools and tokens</li>
<li>The MCP client sees all tools as a unified list, with channel prefixes to avoid name collisions</li>
</ol>

<p dir="auto">There is a <code>Dockerfile</code> specifically for Smithery deployment.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you'd like to use docker to run the websocket server, I've added a <code>docker-compose.yml</code> for demonstration purposes.</p>
<p dir="auto">If <code>--docker</code> is provided to the mcp client config alongside <code>--mcp</code>, it will assume the server is running. This will allow you to dockerize the main process (websocket server), and your mcp client will connect to your docker container via websocket. Similarly, websites will communicate with your docker container.</p>

    <p>I don’t want to mislead anyone here. This corner of the website—“New Stuff”—is not a resurrection of <em>The Far Side</em> daily cartoons. (Well, not exactly, anyway—like the proverbial tiger and its stripes, I’m pretty much stuck with my sense of humor. Aren’t we all?) The thing is, I <em>thoroughly</em> enjoyed my career as a syndicated cartoonist, and I hope, in spirit at least, we had some laughs together. But after fifteen years of meeting deadlines, well, blah blah blah … you know the rest. The day after I retired from syndication, it felt good <em>not</em> to draw on a deadline. And after moving on to other interests, drawing just wasn’t on my to-do list. Things change. But then a few years ago—and returning to the subject at hand—­something happened in my life, and it started with a clogged pen.</p>
    <p>Despite my retirement, I still had intermittent connections to cartooning, including my wife’s and my personal Christmas card. Once a year, I’d sit myself down to take on Santa, and every year it began with the same ritual: me cursing at, and then cleaning out, my clogged pen. (Apparently, the concept of cleaning it before putting it away each year was just too elusive for me.) As problems go, this is admittedly not exactly on the scale of global warming, but in the small world of my studio, it was cataclysmic. Okay, highly annoying.</p>
    <p>So a few years ago—finally fed up with my once-loyal but now reliably traitorous pen—I decided to try a digital tablet. I knew nothing about these devices but hoped it would just get me through my annual Christmas card ordeal. I got one, fired it up, and lo and behold, something totally unexpected happened: within moments, I was having fun drawing again. I was stunned at all the tools the thing offered, all the creative potential it contained. I simply had no idea how far these things had evolved. Perhaps fittingly, the first thing I drew was a caveman.</p>
    <p>The “New Stuff” that you’ll see here is the result of my journey into the world of digital art. Believe me, this has been a bit of a learning curve for me. I hail from a world of pen and ink, and suddenly I was feeling like I was sitting at the controls of a 747. (True, I don’t get out much.) But as overwhelmed as I was, there was still something familiar there—a sense of adventure. That had always been at the core of what I enjoyed most when I was drawing <em>The Far Side</em>, that sense of exploring, reaching for something, taking some risks, sometimes hitting a home run and sometimes coming up with “Cow tools.” (Let’s not get into that.) But as a jazz teacher once said to me about improvisation, “You want to try and take people somewhere where they might not have been before.” I think that my approach to cartooning was similar—I’m just not sure if even <em>I</em> knew where I was going. But I was having fun.</p>
    <p>So here goes. I’ve got my coffee, I’ve got this cool gizmo, and I’ve got no deadlines. And—to borrow from Sherlock Holmes—the game is afoot.</p>
    <p>Again, please remember, I’m just exploring, experimenting, and trying stuff. New Stuff. I have just one last thing to say before I go: thank <em>you</em>, clogged pen.</p>

The recent collapses of Tricolor, a used car seller and sub-prime auto lender, and First Brands, an auto parts supplier, have put the finance industry on edge, almost two decades after problems in the sub-prime mortgage lending market set the stage for the global financial crisis.</p><p>“When you see one cockroach, there are probably more,” Jamie Dimon, the JPMorgan Chase CEO, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/oct/14/jp-morgan-jamie-dimon-losses-private-credit-sector" data-link-name="in body link">ominously cautioned analysts</a> this week, after the US’s largest bank disclosed a $170m charge tied to Tricolor’s bankruptcy. “Everyone should be forewarned on this one.”</p><p>As the car lending market shows signs of strain, business around repossessions is booming. “Right now, we’re overwhelmed with work,” George Badeen, who runs Midwest Recovery and Adjustment in Detroit, Michigan, said.</p><figure id="1dff80fa-3f0c-40ee-8c10-c2cb38476e3c" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props="{&quot;richLinkIndex&quot;:3,&quot;element&quot;:{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&quot;,&quot;prefix&quot;:&quot;Related: &quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;JP Morgan boss says more ‘cockroaches’ will emerge after private credit sector failures&quot;,&quot;elementId&quot;:&quot;1dff80fa-3f0c-40ee-8c10-c2cb38476e3c&quot;,&quot;role&quot;:&quot;richLink&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/oct/14/jp-morgan-jamie-dimon-losses-private-credit-sector&quot;},&quot;ajaxUrl&quot;:&quot;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&quot;,&quot;format&quot;:{&quot;design&quot;:10,&quot;display&quot;:0,&quot;theme&quot;:0}}"></gu-island></figure><p>The so-called repo man, tasked with recovering vehicles from drivers who default on loan agreements, was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lj1x5LejAuM&amp;list=RDlj1x5LejAuM&amp;start_radio=1" data-link-name="in body link">eulogized in music by Bruce Springsteen</a> and in the 1984 Alex Cox film Repo Man.</p><p>Repossessions – especially in the sub-prime auto market – are on the rise, according to Badeen, who is also president of the Allied Finance Adjusters trade body. “We’ve seen some sub-primes making changes, which probably indicates they’re having issues,” he said. “They’re not financing cars like they were. Two years ago they were financing anybody.”</p><p>While few are bracing for a crisis on the scale of the crash that pushed the world economy to the brink in 2008 – sub-prime auto lending is a fraction of the $1.7tn overall car lending business – the collapses of Tricolor and First Brands have drawn the car sector into the spotlight, amid fears they highlight credit stress in lower-income households, as well as problems in credit markets tied to auto debt.</p><p>First Brands received approval for $500m rescue financing from a bankruptcy court, although Scott Greenberg, an attorney for First Brand’s lenders, told the court of concerns that they could be “lending good money after bad”.</p><p>The wider fear – and the one causing consternation among investors – is what the troubles inside this one market might indicate about broader pressures rippling throughout the wider economy. “Distress in auto lending broadly is often seen as a bellwether to changing circumstances in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/useconomy" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">US economy</a>, because Americans particularly in the lower-income brackets tend to put their highest priority in auto payments,” said Brett House, an economics professor at Columbia Business School.</p><p>“Having a car is essential to being able to work,” he added. “So when we see stress in the auto financing market, we typically receive that as an indication that household finances are getting tighter.”</p><p>An estimated 100 million Americans hold auto loans, with 85% of new car purchases and 55% of used car purchases financed. It is the third-largest consumer credit market in the US, behind mortgages and student loans.</p><p>Problems in the auto loan industry have been manifesting for several years, as car prices rose sharply during the Covid-19 pandemic while inflation soared and interest rate increases followed. Paying off a new car required 42 weeks of income in 2023, according to Cox Automotive, up from about 33 before the pandemic.</p><p>High prices meant bigger loans. The average monthly repayment now stands at more than $750.</p><p>Car repossessions surged to their highest level since 2009 last year, according to Cox, with 1.73m vehicles seized, up 16% from the year prior and 43% from 2022.</p><p>Car owners were found to be missing payments at the highest rate in more than 30 years in January, when a Fitch Ratings index monitoring the share of sub-prime auto borrowers at least 60 days past due on their loans hit 6.5%.</p><p>“The consumer has been distressed for a little while,” Bill Nash, CEO of CarMax, the biggest seller of used cars in the US, told analysts last month after its lower sales and profits unnerved shareholders. “I think there’s some angst.”</p><p>Auto loans are short-term investments, and Kevin Armstrong, author of Repo Blood: A Century of Auto Repossession History, believes they are often extended to consumers who may not be credit-worthy. For this reason, he said, auto loan delinquencies are often seen as clues – “one of the canaries in the coalmine” – to the health of the broader economy.</p><p>Loan operators are now “giving out massive amounts of loan modification to try to move back delinquencies” to stave off repossession orders, Armstrong said. But they may only be buying time. “There’s a massive amount of recidivism when it comes to loan delinquencies,” he added.</p><p>Armstrong traces the rise in repossessions to the pandemic, when stimulus checks and extra unemployment aid allowed consumers to pay up for pricier cars. “When Covid hit, prices went through the roof,” he said. “I watched people paying outrageous amounts for cars that just weren’t going to hold their value, and the dealers laughing all the way to the bank. They got hosed.”</p><p>Now, coupled with higher mortgage or rental payments, high grocery bills and higher auto loan payments, he added: “Consumers got stuck with loan payments they can’t afford.”</p><p>Under most loan agreements, the lender or leaseholder can repossess the car even if borrowers are only a few weeks behind in payments, in part because a borrower could try to hide the car if they know the lender is looking to repossess it – and potentially sell it at auction.</p><figure id="ea2a3db9-8d5e-4c95-b00b-9bee4e55d030" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props="{&quot;richLinkIndex&quot;:21,&quot;element&quot;:{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&quot;,&quot;prefix&quot;:&quot;Related: &quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;First Brands: why a maker of spark plugs and wiper blades has Wall Street worried&quot;,&quot;elementId&quot;:&quot;ea2a3db9-8d5e-4c95-b00b-9bee4e55d030&quot;,&quot;role&quot;:&quot;richLink&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/oct/10/first-brands-wall-street&quot;},&quot;ajaxUrl&quot;:&quot;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&quot;,&quot;format&quot;:{&quot;design&quot;:10,&quot;display&quot;:0,&quot;theme&quot;:0}}"></gu-island></figure><p>The job of repossessing a car is becoming harder, according to Badeen, with greater consumer rights awareness and a higher likelihood of confrontation. “We’ve had so much violence in recent years that we’ve had to train our people in what people like to call situational awareness and de-escalation,” he said. His company typically now sends tow trucks out with two people, one to pick up the car and another to keep watch.</p><p>The clouds gathering over the auto lending market could grow darker. Should Congress fail to agree on a continuation of Covid-era healthcare subsidies, the political issue at the center of the current federal government shutdown, that could put more pressure on the finances of auto borrowers.</p><p>“That whole mess comes out of Covid. It has an impact on individual people that many people don’t understand,” said Badeen. “Everything intertwines in some way, shape or form.”</p><p>If a large sub-prime lender stumbles as a result of this pressure – Santander Consumer is the nation’s biggest, and was last year <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-becerra-announces-over-550-million-settlement-against-nation%E2%80%99s" data-link-name="in body link">fined $550m</a> to resolve claims it violated consumer protection laws by placing borrowers with sub-prime credit into auto loans it knew carried an unacceptably high probability of default – there could be wider turbulence.</p><p>Unlike First Brands, Tricolor sought bankruptcy protection last month under the shadow of fraud allegations that have prompted two federal investigations. Charles Gibbs, the attorney representing Tricolor’s court-appointed trustee, told a Texas court this month that initial reports “indicate potentially systemic levels of fraud”.</p><p>“Tricolor’s failure is not necessarily indicative of what is immediately ahead for the sector as a whole, because of the special circumstances, but I would still see it as an economic warning indicator,” said House.</p><p>Armstrong, too, was reluctant to call the failure of the companies, and the rise in repossessions, a trend. “But it’s on the verge,” he added.</p></div></div>]]></description>

        <p><strong>TL;DR - We just gave Skyvern the ability to write and maintain its own code, making it 2.7x cheaper and 2.3x faster.

We use computer vision + LLMs to turn prompts into automations that run. We serve both technical and non-technical customers, and have helped them automate things like applying to jobs, fetching invoices or utility bills, filling out government forms, and purchase products from hundreds of different websites.</p><h2 id="asking-ai-to-build-scrapers-should-be-easy-right-right">Asking AI to build scrapers should be easy right? Right??</h2><figure><img src="https://www.skyvern.com/blog/content/images/2025/10/image---2025-10-17T132106.418.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="603" height="269" srcset="https://www.skyvern.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2025/10/image---2025-10-17T132106.418.png 600w, https://www.skyvern.com/blog/content/images/2025/10/image---2025-10-17T132106.418.png 603w"></figure><p>Some of you may remember our <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39706004&amp;ref=skyvern.com">Hackernews launch</a> from last year. All of the discussion circled around the same idea: “Building the automation is the hard part… we just want Skyvern to write the code”.</p><p>We agreed. Keeping the agent in the loop means invoking an expensive and non-deterministic LLM call on every run. If Skyvern could compile its reasoning into code and run that instead of keeping an LLM in the loop, automations would become <strong>faster, cheaper, and more reliable.</strong></p><p>So we tried to teach Skyvern to do exactly that… but it turns out, asking AI to write code the same way you and I would wasn’t easy. We ran into two big problems:</p><ol><li>Requirements for automations are ambiguous at best, and misleading at worst — even humans struggle to define them clearly</li><li>The internet is messy: drop-downs masquerade as textboxes, checkboxes that are always checked, and search bars that are secretly buttons.</li></ol><p>Getting an agent to navigate that chaos, understand intent, and still produce maintainable code came through one major breakthrough: <strong>reasoning models</strong>.</p><p>Reasoning models unlock two important capabilities:</p><ol><li>They <a href="https://www.skyvern.com/blog/web-bench-a-new-way-to-compare-ai-browser-agents/">boosted the agent accuracy</a> enough for production use</li><li>They let the agent leverage its trajectory to write a script resembling something an engineer would write</li></ol><h2 id="this-is-too-abstract-when-does-this-matter">This is too abstract.

Any seasoned developer would know that these legal structures are linked together. You’d instinctively model them as a finite set of entity types, and create a tree-like script that branches into different paths based on the input.</p><p>But that abstraction doesn’t exist for an agent. To agents like Skyvern, this is just a list of buttons. The relationship between the users’ input and the available set of legal structures doesn’t exist ahead of time — it must be discovered at runtime.</p><p>The agent has to infer, from the DOM and the page transitions, which choices lead where.</p><h3 id="random-non-deterministic-failures">Random non-deterministic failures</h3><p>Agents shine when things don’t go as planned. We don’t want to hard code every single edge case when compiling an agent into a deterministic script.. because we’re back to writing brittle scripts. Instead, we want to leverage agents for these situations.</p><p>Take this government form: Delaware’s portal is unavailable at night or over the weekend.

We needed to copy how developers actually work: figure out the flow, add logic where it breaks, and bake that behavior into Skyvern.</p><p>So we split its job into two:</p><ol><li>Explore mode, where the agent learns how to navigate a website for a given flow, generating any metadata necessary for it to operate in subsequent runs</li></ol><p>Replay mode, it compiles those learnings into deterministic Playwright and runs fast and cheap, only falling back to the agent when something new or weird happens</p><figure><img src="https://www.skyvern.com/blog/content/images/2025/10/image---2025-10-17T132046.901.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1329" height="583" srcset="https://www.skyvern.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2025/10/image---2025-10-17T132046.901.png 600w, https://www.skyvern.com/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2025/10/image---2025-10-17T132046.901.png 1000w, https://www.skyvern.com/blog/content/images/2025/10/image---2025-10-17T132046.901.png 1329w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h3 id="explore-once-get-the-agents%E2%80%99-trajectory">Explore once: get the agents’ trajectory</h3><p>Let’s start with a plain prompt for Skyvern. The <code>ein_info</code> field is just a json blob with all of a company’s metadata (entity type, responsible party, etc).

A few examples:</p><ol><li><strong>Invoice Downloading</strong></li></ol><p>Agents log into vendor or utility portals with 1000s of different accounts, navigate to the right billing period, and pull invoices. When layouts or date filters change, the intent metadata lets them recover automatically instead of failing.</p><ol start="2"><li><strong>Purchasing</strong></li></ol><p>Teams use it to automate repeat purchases — think renewing software licenses or buying supplies through the same vendor dashboard each month. The first run learns the checkout path, the fallbacks handle the variety of products, and the replays run deterministically, flagging if a price or SKU changes.</p><ol start="3"><li><strong>Data Extraction from Legacy Systems</strong></li></ol><p>Skyvern navigates authenticated dashboards, scrapes tables or PDFs, and pushes the structured output into into a database via Webhooks. If the DOM shifts, Skyvern reuses the same intention (“extract transaction rows”) to remap selectors.</p><ol start="4"><li><strong>Government Form Filling</strong></li></ol><p>From payroll registration to business license renewals, Skyvern handles long, multi-step government forms that occasionally break static scripts. Explore mode figures out the flow once replay mode repeats it safely.</p><h2 id="what%E2%80%99s-next-is-it-perfect-today">What’s next? Is it perfect today?</h2><p>Not quite. The architecture works well, but there are still a few places where we can make it smarter and cheaper:</p><ol><li><strong>Analyze groups of runs when generating code</strong>.</li></ol><p>Right now, we don’t aggregate insights across failures. Each replay fixes itself in isolation. If we could analyze <em>many</em> runs together, spotting which selectors break, which flows diverge, we could automatically generalize better code and reduce the need for fallbacks. That’s especially useful for workflows that branch like trees (different inputs → different paths).</p><ol start="2"><li><strong>Cache data extractions</strong>.</li></ol><p>During data extraction, we still rely on the LLM to “read” the page each time because many of our users want to both extract and summarize information at the same time. For example, if you ask Skyvern to pull the summaries of the top five posts on Hacker News, it currently parses the DOM from scratch. We’d like to trace <em>how</em> the model found those elements (which selectors, which substrings) and reuse that mapping. That alone could make scraping and data-harvesting flows an order of magnitude cheaper.</p><ol start="3"><li><strong>Expose everything through the SDK.</strong></li></ol><p>We think it will be valuable for developers using the Skyvern SDK to auto-generate these scripts for any ai actions / workflows they run, and use them automatically for subsequent runs. It currently requires a Skyvern server running, but soon it will be the default behaviour.</p><h2 id="give-it-a-try">Give it a try!</h2><p>Run it via our <a href="https://github.com/Skyvern-AI/Skyvern?ref=skyvern.com">Skyvern Open Source</a> or <a href="http://app.skyvern.com/?ref=skyvern.com">Skyvern Cloud</a> versions and let us know what you think!</p>

<p> "To be perfectly honest, it's harder than we thought it would be," Paczynski explained. "What we've found out is that games and how they work has deteriorated way faster than what we thought. And we are not talking only about the game not launching. We are talking about more subtle things as well, like the game not supporting modern controllers, or the game not supporting ultra-widescreen or modern resolutions, or even a simple thing like not being able to minimise the game, which is an essential feature today."</p>    <p>On top of the software troubles, there's also the small matter of obtaining the intellectual property rights of an old game. Paczynski says they once hired a private investigator to find someone living off the grid in the UK. He had unknowingly inherited the rights to several games, but was super supportive of "preserving his family's legacy" when GOG tracked him down.</p>    

<div id="custom_block_6" data-nosnippet="">

        
            <p>Nightdive, a studio that primarily focuses on remastering and remaking classic titles, was actually created because the founder was annoyed he couldn't play System Shock. He tracked down the insurance company that inherited the rights to the franchise and purchased them, and then began working on remaking the iconic immersive sim.</p>
    
        
    </div><p>Pacyznski says digital rights management (DRM) features are especially frustrating to circumvent, which means they're working as designed. Heck, some rather famous games are unplayable without third-party patches because of DRM — any old Xbox-to-PC that's saddled with a "Games for Windows Live" log-in comes to mind.</p>    <p>Pacyznski suggests that triple-A developers remove DRM from games after a few years to make life easier for future game preservationists. Of course, this will never happen because executives don't care about preserving games.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://forgejo.org/2025-10-release-v13-0/">https://forgejo.org/2025-10-release-v13-0/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45620333">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p><a href="https://forgejo.org/download/">Forgejo v13.0</a> was released on 16 October 2025. You will find a short selection of the changes it introduces below and a <a href="https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/milestone/21377">complete list in the release notes</a>.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://v13.next.forgejo.org/">dedicated test instance</a> is available to try it out. Before upgrading it is <em>strongly recommended</em> to make a full backup as explained in the <a href="https://forgejo.org/docs/v13.0/admin/upgrade/">upgrade guide</a> and carefully read <em>all breaking changes</em> from the <a href="https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/milestone/21377">release notes</a>. If in doubt, do not hesitate to ask for help <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#forgejo-chat:matrix.org">in the chat room</a>.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary<a href="#summary"><span aria-label="Permalink to “Summary” section"></span></a></h2>
<p>Content moderation is one of the main roadblocks for federation. A first step is now available to <a href="https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/pulls/6977">users and admins</a>. It was completed while ActivityPub related pull requests were <a href="https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/pulls?type=all&amp;state=closed&amp;labels=79349&amp;milestone=21377">worked on in parallel and merged</a>.</p>
<p>Security was improved under the hood for <a href="https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/pulls/8692">Forgejo Actions secrets</a> now using a more secure module <a href="https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/pulls/5041">introduced in 2024</a> and <a href="https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/pulls/6074">already in use for TOTP secrets</a> since Forgejo v10. In addition it is now possible to <a href="https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/pulls/8753">require 2FA instance wide</a>.</p>
<p>Forgejo Actions usability was improved with <a href="https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/pulls/9017">access to all run attempts</a> of each workflow: they were stored but not available via the web UI. The workflow files are now <a href="https://forgejo.org/docs/v13.0/user/actions/troubleshooting/#schema-validation">statically checked</a>, for early detection of errors such as the usage of a wrong context in an expression like <code>${{ forgejo.server_url }}</code>.</p>
<h3 id="reporting-abusive-content">Reporting abusive content<a href="#reporting-abusive-content"><span aria-label="Permalink to “Reporting abusive content” section"></span></a></h3>
<p>Moderation on public Forgejo instance is a hard and time-consuming task as there are no builtin tools to help with this. Although self-moderation allows users with no elevated privileges to <a href="https://forgejo.org/docs/v13.0/user/blocking-user/">block abusive behavior</a>, it is sometime necessary to get an instance administrator involved.</p>
<p><a href="https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/pulls/6977">It is now possible to report</a> users, organizations, repositories, issues, pull request or comments that should be looked at by instance administrators. A category and an explanation of why the content is problematic must be attached.</p>
<p><img alt="Reporting abusive content" loading="lazy" decoding="async" fetchpriority="auto" width="824" height="450" src="https://forgejo.org/_astro/2025-10-moderation-0.CNOZkc2u_rg4T4.webp"></p>
<p>Those reports are then <a href="https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/pulls/7905">made available in the admin interface</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="Administrative interface for abusive content reports" loading="lazy" decoding="async" fetchpriority="auto" width="925" height="525" src="https://forgejo.org/_astro/2025-10-moderation-1.95NidYUH_1l46Qf.webp"></p>
<p>When multiple reports are submitted for the same content, they are grouped and the counter from the right side shows how many open reports are linked to that content. Clicking on this counter will open a details page where the full details of all grouped reports can be viewed.</p>
<h3 id="migration-from-pagure">Migration from Pagure<a href="#migration-from-pagure"><span aria-label="Permalink to “Migration from Pagure” section"></span></a></h3>
<p>Repositories from <a href="https://pagure.io/">Pagure</a> can be <a href="https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/pulls/8513">migrated to Forgejo</a>. It can be used, for instance, in the context of <a href="https://fedoramagazine.org/fedora-moves-towards-forgejo-a-unified-decision/">the transition of Fedora from Pagure to Forgejo</a> that was decided in December 2024.</p>
<p><img alt="Icon of pagure in the migration page" loading="lazy" decoding="async" fetchpriority="auto" width="1408" height="664" src="https://forgejo.org/_astro/2025-10-pagure.CgbBzWsI_22ENLX.webp"></p>
<h3 id="configurable-global-2fa-enforcement">Configurable global 2FA enforcement<a href="#configurable-global-2fa-enforcement"><span aria-label="Permalink to “Configurable global 2FA enforcement” section"></span></a></h3>
<p>The <a href="https://forgejo.org/docs/v13.0/admin/config-cheat-sheet/#security-security"><code>[security].GLOBAL_TWO_FACTOR_REQUIREMENT</code></a> setting was <a href="https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/pulls/8753">added</a> to require two factor authentication (TOTP, etc.) for either all users or instance administrators.</p>
<p><img alt="Admin panel showing global 2FA enforcement" loading="lazy" decoding="async" fetchpriority="auto" width="744" height="372" src="https://forgejo.org/_astro/2025-10-two-factor.C9A3CTJ3_ZccLD4.webp"></p>
<h3 id="avatar-image-privacy">Avatar image privacy<a href="#avatar-image-privacy"><span aria-label="Permalink to “Avatar image privacy” section"></span></a></h3>
<p>Uploaded avatar images can sometimes contain unexpected metadata such as the location where the image was created, or the device the image was created with, stored in a format called EXIF. Forgejo now <a href="https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/pulls/9638">removes EXIF data</a> when custom user and repository images are uploaded in order to reduce the risk of personally identifiable information being leaked unexpectedly.</p>
<p>A new <a href="https://forgejo.org/docs/v13.0/admin/command-line/#doctor-avatar-strip-exif">CLI subcommand</a> <code>forgejo doctor avatar-strip-exif</code> can be used to strip EXIF information from all existing avatars; we recommend that administrators run this command once after upgrade in order to minimize this risk for existing stored files.</p>
<h3 id="view-previous-forgejo-actions-attempts">View previous Forgejo Actions attempts<a href="#view-previous-forgejo-actions-attempts"><span aria-label="Permalink to “View previous Forgejo Actions attempts” section"></span></a></h3>
<p>It is now <a href="https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/pulls/9017">possible to view previous logs</a> for Actions runs that have been retried.</p>
<p><img alt="Run attempt dropdown" loading="lazy" decoding="async" fetchpriority="auto" width="1441" height="339" src="https://forgejo.org/_astro/2025-10-run-attempt-dropdown.CH5_JQEJ_pAvq8.webp"></p>
<h3 id="static-check-of-actions-workflow-files">Static check of Actions workflow files<a href="#static-check-of-actions-workflow-files"><span aria-label="Permalink to “Static check of Actions workflow files” section"></span></a></h3>
<p><a href="https://forgejo.org/docs/v13.0/user/actions/basic-concepts/#basic-syntax">Forgejo Actions workflows</a> are statically verified in the web UI for common errors such as using an incorrect context (e.g. <code>${{ badcontext.FORGEJO_REPOSITORY }}</code>) or a typo in a required keyword (e.g. <code>ruins-on:</code> instead of <code>runs-on:</code>). It is reported in the action page and the web page that displays the file in the repository.</p>
<p>This is in addition to similar tooling provided by <a href="https://code.forgejo.org/forgejo/runner/releases/tag/v9.0.0">the Forgejo runner itself</a> and helps detect errors as soon as possible.</p>
<p><img alt="Workflow validation error example" loading="lazy" decoding="async" fetchpriority="auto" width="1031" height="676" src="https://forgejo.org/_astro/2025-10-workflow-validation._k835nB6_Z4pTxw.webp"></p>
<h3 id="show-ci-status-on-force-push">Show CI status on force push<a href="#show-ci-status-on-force-push"><span aria-label="Permalink to “Show CI status on force push” section"></span></a></h3>
<p>When force-pushing to a pull request, a line is added to the conversation view to compare the two. However, the CI status of commits in such line was hidden behind an additional click. It is <a href="https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/pulls/8655">now displayed next to the SHA of each commit</a>, similar to commits from normal pushes.</p>
<p><img alt="CI status in the pull request conversation page" loading="lazy" decoding="async" fetchpriority="auto" width="1031" height="676" src="https://forgejo.org/_astro/2025-10-status-force-push.4URhMI_A_xJtFE.webp"></p>
<h3 id="markdown-editor-bold--italic-keyboard-shortcuts">Markdown editor bold &amp; italic keyboard shortcuts<a href="#markdown-editor-bold--italic-keyboard-shortcuts"><span aria-label="Permalink to “Markdown editor bold &amp; italic keyboard shortcuts” section"></span></a></h3>
<p><a href="https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/pulls/9110">Keyboard shortcuts were implemented</a> in the markdown editor for formatting features <strong>Bold</strong> and <strong>Italic</strong> so that they can be used more quickly. Behavior of using shortcuts is the same as clicking the buttons.</p>
<p><img alt="Tooltip showing how to use keyboard shortcuts for bold and italics" loading="lazy" decoding="async" fetchpriority="auto" width="1416" height="766" src="https://forgejo.org/_astro/2025-10-shortcut.aJxvD4jX_zJ5qO.webp"></p>
<h3 id="timestamps-on-release-attachments">Timestamps on release attachments<a href="#timestamps-on-release-attachments"><span aria-label="Permalink to “Timestamps on release attachments” section"></span></a></h3>
<p>The time when a release attachment was uploaded is <a href="https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/pulls/8757">now shown among other information about it</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="Timestamp tooltip on a release attachment" loading="lazy" decoding="async" fetchpriority="auto" width="1400" height="634" src="https://forgejo.org/_astro/2025-10-release-timestamp.BZii6Y-x_HauKb.webp"></p>
<h3 id="tags-are-shown-in-commit-lists">Tags are shown in commit lists<a href="#tags-are-shown-in-commit-lists"><span aria-label="Permalink to “Tags are shown in commit lists” section"></span></a></h3>
<p>When viewing repository’s commits, <a href="https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/pulls/8759">tags are now shown next to the commits</a> they are associated with.</p>
<p><img alt="Tags shown in the list of commits" loading="lazy" decoding="async" fetchpriority="auto" width="1000" height="592" src="https://forgejo.org/_astro/2025-10-commit-list-tag.ChsHTigu_YrTE.webp"></p>
<h3 id="logger-mode-settings-logger_name_mode">Logger mode settings <code>LOGGER_&lt;NAME&gt;_MODE</code><a href="#logger-mode-settings-logger_name_mode"><span aria-label="Permalink to “Logger mode settings LOGGER_<NAME>_MODE” section"></span></a></h3>
<p>The <a href="https://forgejo.org/docs/v13.0/admin/config-cheat-sheet/#log-log">logger settings</a> were <a href="https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/pulls/8667">renamed</a> from <code>logger.&lt;name&gt;.MODE</code> to <code>LOGGER_&lt;NAME&gt;_MODE</code> to help setting them with environment variables when using a container image. For instance:</p>

This is possible because of people supporting me on the premium. Thanks so much for reading.</p></em></p><hr><p>One of the only consistent critiques of my work is that I’m angry, irate, that I am taking myself too seriously, that I’m swearing too much, and that my arguments would be “better received” if I “calmed down.”</p><p>Fuck that.</p><p>Look at where being timid or deferential has got us. <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/openai-broadcom-to-co-develop-10gw-of-custom-ai-chips?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>Broadcom and OpenAI have announced another 10GW of custom chips and supposed capacity</u></a> which will supposedly get fully deployed by the end of 2029, and still the media neutrally reports these things as not simply doable, <em>but rational.</em></p><p>To be clear, building a gigawatt of data center capacity <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/openai-onetrillion/#it-takes-25-years-and-325-billion-per-gigawatt-of-data-center-compute"><u>costs at least $32.5 billion</u></a> (though <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/7cee5e77-2618-4ed4-b600-aee22238d07a?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>Jensen Huang says the computing hardware alone costs $50 billion</u></a>, which excludes the buildings themselves and the supporting power infrastructure, and <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidias-jensen-math-50-billion-033104538.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAANHIkgwv5Z0GjXxI0M8u_0IWzeOe5OfeapTZH47PmwIop8Cj9dW9C2QeLeq4KjkkmF9NTKvFjXShbeuaIqEEY4ATN7JPamaGTPF-7Fx8OZVhTxbR1yzBNDXkmA8YfuURWvYP-BQ-AGwWuUYXotxNXekUPSUq2RrN9-7tSF5Ts1TZ&amp;ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>Barclays Bank says $50 billion to $60 billion</u></a>) and takes two and a half years.&nbsp;</p><blockquote>In fact, fuck it — I’m updating my priors. Let’s say it’s a nice, round $50 billion per gigawatt of data center capacity. $32.5 billion is what it cost to build Stargate Abilene, but that estimate was based on <a href="https://www.crusoe.ai/resources/newsroom/crusoe-blue-owl-capital-and-primary-digital-infrastructure-enter-joint-venture?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>Crusoe’s 1.2GW of compute for OpenAI being part of a $15 billion joint venture</u></a>, which meant a gigawatt of compute runs about $12.5 billion, and Abilene’s 8 buildings are meant to hold 50,000 NVIDIA GB200 GPUs and their associated networking infrastructure, so let’s say a gigawatt is around 333,333 Blackwell GPUs at $60,000 a piece, so about $20 billion a gigawatt. <p>However, this mathematics assumed that every cost associated would be paid by the Joint Venture. Lancium, the owner of the land that is allegedly building the power infrastructure, has now raised over a </p><a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/blackstone-invests-500-million-in-lancium-report/?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>billion</u></a> <a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/lancium-secures-600m-in-debt-financing-report/?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>dollars</u></a>. <p>This maths also didn’t include the cost of the associated networking infrastructure around the GB200s. So, guess what? We’re doing $50 billion now.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>OpenAI has now promised 33GW of capacity across <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/06/openai-amd-chip-deal-ai.html?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>AMD</u></a>, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/23/altman-huang-negotiations-that-sealed-100-billion-openai-nvidia-deal.html?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>NVIDIA</u></a>, Broadcom and <a href="https://openai.com/index/five-new-stargate-sites/?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>the seven data centers built under Stargate</u></a>, though one of those — in Lordstown, Ohio — is not actually a data center, with my source being “SoftBank,” <a href="https://www.wkbn.com/news/local-news/lordstown-news/more-details-drill-down-lordstowns-role-in-ai-project/?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>speaking to WKBN in Lordstown Ohio</u></a>, which said it will “not be a full-blown data center,” and instead be “at the center of cutting-edge technology that will encompass storage containers that will hold the infrastructure for AI and data storage.”</p><p>This wasn’t hard to find, by the way! I googled “SoftBank Lordstown” and up it came, ready for me to read with my eyes.</p><p>Putting all of that aside, I think it’s time that everybody started taking this situation far more seriously, by which I mean acknowledging the sheer recklessness and naked market manipulation taking place.&nbsp;</p><p>But let’s make it really simple, and write out what’s meant to happen in the next year:</p><ul><li><a href="https://openai.com/index/openai-and-broadcom-announce-strategic-collaboration/?ref=wheresyoured.at#:~:text=Broadcom%20to%20deploy%20racks%20of%20AI%20accelerator%20and%20network%20systems%20targeted%20to%20start%20in%20the%20second%20half%20of%202026%2C%20to%20complete%20by%20end%20of%202029"><strong><u>In the second half of 2026</u></strong></a><strong>, </strong>OpenAI and Broadcom will tape out and successfully complete an AI inference chip, then manufacture enough of them to fill a 1GW data center.<ul><li>That data center will be built in an as-yet-unknown location, and will have at least 1GW of power, but more realistically it will need 1.2GW to 1.3GW of power, because for every 1GW of IT load, you need extra power capacity in reserve for the hottest day of the year, when the cooling system works hardest and power transmission losses are highest. .&nbsp;</li><li>OpenAI does not appear to have a site for this data center, and thus has not broken ground on it.</li></ul></li><li><strong>In the second half of 2026, </strong>AMD and OpenAI will begin “<a href="https://ir.amd.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1260/amd-and-openai-announce-strategic-partnership-to-deploy-6-gigawatts-of-amd-gpus?ref=wheresyoured.at#:~:text=The%20first%201%20gigawatt%20deployment%20of%20AMD%20Instinct%20MI450%20GPUs%20is%20set%20to%20begin%20in%20the%20second%20half%20of%202026"><u>the first 1 gigawatt deployment of AMD Instinct MI450 GPUs</u></a>.”&nbsp;<ul><li>This will take place in an as-yet-unnamed data center location, which to be completed by that time would have needed to start construction and early procurement of power at least a year ago, if not more.&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li><strong>In the second half of 2026, </strong><a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/openai-and-nvidia-announce-strategic-partnership-to-deploy-10gw-of-nvidia-systems?ref=wheresyoured.at#:~:text=The%20first%20gigawatt%20of%20NVIDIA%20systems%20will%20be%20deployed%20in%20the%20second%20half%20of%202026%20on%20the%20NVIDIA%20Vera%20Rubin%20platform."><u>OpenAI and NVIDIA will deploy the first gigawatt of NVIDIA’s Vera Rubin GPU systems</u></a> as part of their $100 billion deal.<ul><li>These GPUs will be deployed in a data center of some sort, which remains unnamed, but for them to meet this timeline they will need to have started construction at least a year ago.</li></ul></li></ul><p>In my most conservative estimate, these data centers will cost over $100 billion, and to be clear, a lot of that money needs to already be in OpenAI’s hands to get the data centers built. Or, some other dupe has to a.) have the money, and b.) be willing to front it.&nbsp;</p><p>All of this is a fucking joke. I’m sorry, I know some of you will read this, cowering from your screen like a B-movie vampire that just saw a crucifix, but it is a joke, and it is a fucking stupid joke, the only thing stupider being that any number of respectable media outlets are saying these things like they’ll actually happen.</p><p>There is not enough time to build these things. If there was enough time, there wouldn’t be enough money. If there was enough money, there wouldn’t be enough transformers, electrical-grade steel, or specialised talent to run the power to the data centers. Fuck! Piss! Shit! Swearing doesn’t change the fact that I’m right — none of what OpenAI, NVIDIA, Broadcom, and AMD are saying is possible, and it’s fair to ask why they’re saying it.</p><p>I mean, we know. Number must go up, deal must go through, and Jensen Huang wouldn’t go on CNBC and say “yeah man if I’m honest I’ve got no fucking clue how Sam Altman is going to pay me, other than with the $10 billion I’m handing him in a month. Anyway, <a href="https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/NVDA/nvidia/receivables-total?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>NVIDIA’s accounts receivables keep increasing every quarter</u></a> <a href="https://selftaughtmba.substack.com/p/does-nvidia-have-an-accounts-receivable?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>for a normal reason</u></a>, don’t worry about it.”&nbsp;</p><p>But in all seriousness, we now have three publicly-traded tech firms that have all agreed to join Sam Altman’s No IT Loads Refused Cash Dump, all promising to do things on insane timelines that they — as executives of giant hardware manufacturers, or human beings with warm bodies and pulses and sciatica — all must know are impossible to meet.&nbsp;</p><p>What is the media meant to do? What are we, as regular people, meant to do? These stocks keep pumping based on completely nonsensical ideas, and we’re all meant to sit around pretending things are normal and good. They’re not! At some point somebody’s going to start paying people actual, real dollars at a scale that OpenAI has never truly had to reckon with.</p><p>In this piece, I’m going to spell out in no uncertain terms exactly what OpenAI has to do in the next year to fulfil its destiny — having a bunch of capacity that cost ungodly amounts of money to serve demand that never arrives.</p><p>Yes, yes, I know, you’re going to tell me that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/06/sam-altman-says-chatgpt-has-hit-800m-weekly-active-users/?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>OpenAI has 800 million weekly active users</u></a>, and putting aside the fact that OpenAI’s own research (<a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w34255/w34255.pdf?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>see page 10, footnote 20</u></a>) says it double-counts users who are logged out if they’re use different devices, <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/sam-altman-wants-250-gigawatts-power-possible?rc=kz8jh3&amp;ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>OpenAI is saying it wants to build 250 gigawatts of capacity</u></a> by 2033, which will cost it $10 <em>trillion dollars, </em>or one-third of the entire US economy last year<em>.</em></p><p>Who the fuck for?&nbsp;</p><p>One thing that’s important to note: In February, <a href="https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/articles/ai-to-drive-165-increase-in-data-center-power-demand-by-2030?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>Goldman Sachs estimated that the global data center capacity was around 55GW</u></a>. In essence, OpenAI says it wants to add <em>five times that capacity</em> — something that has grown organically over the past thirty or so years — by itself, and in eight years.&nbsp;</p><p>And yes, it’ll cost one-third of America’s output in 2024. This is not a sensible proposition.&nbsp;</p><p>Even if you think that OpenAI’s growth is impressive — it went from <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/04/openai-chatgpt-700-million-users.html?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>700 million</u></a> to 800 million weekly active users in the last two months — that is not the kind of growth that says “build capacity assuming that literally every single human being on Earth uses this all the time.”&nbsp;</p><blockquote><strong>As an aside: </strong>Altman is <em>already lying</em> about his available capacity. <a href="https://sources.news/p/openai-ads-leader-sam-altman-memo-stargate?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>According to an internal Slack note seen by Alex Heath of Sources</u></a>, Altman claims that OpenAI started the year with “around” 230 megawatts of capacity and is “now on track to exit 2025 north of 2GW of operational capacity.” Unless I’m much mistaken OpenAI doesn’t have <em>any</em> capacity of its own — and according to Mr. Altman, it’s somehow <em>built or acquired 1.7GW of capacity from somewhere without disclosing it. </em><p>For context, </p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/estimate-of-data-centre-capacity-great-britain-2024/estimate-of-data-centre-capacity-great-britain-2024?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>1.7GW is the equivalent of every data center in the UK that was operational last year</u></a>.&nbsp;<p>Where is this coming from? Is this CoreWeave?</p><a href="https://www.nextplatform.com/2025/08/15/to-beat-neocloud-rivals-to-openai-coreweave-spends-like-crazy/?ref=wheresyoured.at#:~:text=With%20all%20of%20that%20infrastructure,far%20as%20we%20are%20concerned."><u> It only has — at most — 900MW of capacity by the end of 2025</u></a>. Where’d all the extra capacity come from? Who knows! It isn’t Stargate Abilene that’s for sure — <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/the-ai-bubbles-impossible-promises/"><u>they’ve only got one operational building</u></a> and 200MW of <em>power</em>, meaning they can only really support 130MW of IT loads, because of that pesky reserve I mentioned earlier.&nbsp;</blockquote><p>Anyway, what exactly is OpenAI doing? Why does it need all this capacity? Even if it&nbsp; hits its $13 billion revenue projection for this year (<a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/sora2-openai/"><u>it’s only at $5.3 billion or so as of the end of August, and for OpenAI to hit its targets it’ll need to make $1.5bn+ a month very soon</u></a>), does it really think it’s going to effectively 10x the entire company from here? What possible sign is there of that happening other than a conga-line of different executives willing to stake their reputations on blatant lies peddled by a man best known for needing, at any given moment, <em>another billion dollars</em>.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openais-first-half-results-4-3-billion-sales-2-5-billion-cash-burn?utm_campaign=%5BREBRAND%5D+RTSU+-+Aut&amp;utm_content=1109&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=cio&amp;utm_term=129&amp;rc=kz8jh3"><u>According to The Information</u></a>, OpenAI spent $6.7 billion on research and development in the first six months of 2025, and according to Epoch AI, <a href="https://epoch.ai/data-insights/openai-compute-spend?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>most of the $5 billion it spent on research and development in 2024</u></a> was spent on research, experimental, or derisking runs (basically running tests before doing the final testing run) and models it would never release, with only $480 million going to training <em>actual models that people will use.</em>&nbsp;</p><p>I should also add that <a href="https://futurism.com/openai-screwed-up-gpt-4-5?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>GPT 4.5 was a dud</u></a>, and <a href="https://x.com/sama/status/1895203654103351462?lang=en&amp;ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>even Altman called it giant, expensive, and said it “wouldn’t crush benchmarks.”</u></a></p><p>I’m sorry, but what exactly is it that OpenAI has released in the last year-and-a-half that was worth burning $11.7 billion for?

<p>16th October 2025</p>



<p>Anthropic this morning <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/skills">introduced Claude Skills</a>, a new pattern for making new abilities available to their models:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Claude can now use <em>Skills</em> to improve how it performs specific tasks. Skills are folders that include instructions, scripts, and resources that Claude can load when needed.</p>
<p>Claude will only access a skill when it’s relevant to the task at hand. When used, skills make Claude better at specialized tasks like working with Excel or following your organization’s brand guidelines.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Their engineering blog has a <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/equipping-agents-for-the-real-world-with-agent-skills">more detailed explanation</a>. There’s also a new <a href="https://github.com/anthropics/skills">anthropic/skills</a> GitHub repo.</p>
<p>(I inadvertently preempted their announcement of this feature when I reverse engineered and <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/10/claude-skills/">wrote about it last Friday</a>!)</p>
<p>Skills are conceptually extremely simple: a skill is a Markdown file telling the model how to do something, optionally accompanied by extra documents and pre-written scripts that the model can run to help it accomplish the tasks described by the skill.</p>
<p>Claude’s new <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/create-files">document creation abilities</a>, which accompanied <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/9/claude-code-interpreter/">their new code interpreter feature</a> in September, turned out to be entirely implemented using skills. Those are <a href="https://github.com/anthropics/skills/tree/main/document-skills">now available in Anthropic’s repo</a> covering <code>.pdf</code>, <code>.docx</code>, <code>.xlsx</code>, and <code>.pptx</code> files.</p>
<p>There’s one extra detail that makes this a feature, not just a bunch of files on disk. At the start of a session Claude’s various harnesses can scan all available skill files and read a short explanation for each one from the frontmatter YAML in the Markdown file. This is <em>very</em> token efficient: each skill only takes up a few dozen extra tokens, with the full details only loaded in should the user request a task that the skill can help solve.</p>

<h4 id="trying-out-the-slack-gif-creator-skill">Trying out the slack-gif-creator skill</h4>
<p>Here’s that metadata for an example <a href="https://github.com/anthropics/skills/blob/main/slack-gif-creator/SKILL.md">slack-gif-creator skill</a> that Anthropic published this morning:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Toolkit for creating animated GIFs optimized for Slack, with validators for size constraints and composable animation primitives. This skill applies when users request animated GIFs or emoji animations for Slack from descriptions like “make me a GIF for Slack of X doing Y”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I just tried this skill out in the Claude mobile web app, against Sonnet 4.5. First I enabled the slack-gif-creator skill <a href="https://claude.ai/settings/capabilities">in the settings</a>, then I prompted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Make me a gif for slack about how Skills are way cooler than MCPs</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And Claude <a href="https://claude.ai/share/eff7ae7b-b386-417b-9fa0-213fa76ace6e">made me this GIF</a>. Click to play (it’s almost epilepsy inducing, hence the click-to-play mechanism):</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/skills_vs_mcps_still.gif" data-still="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/skills_vs_mcps_still.gif" data-gif="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/skills_vs_mcps.gif" data-state="stopped" role="button" aria-pressed="false" tabindex="0" onload="(new Image).src=this.getAttribute('data-gif')" onclick="(function(el){     if (el.getAttribute('data-state') !== 'playing') {       var c = el.cloneNode(true);       c.src = el.getAttribute('data-gif');       c.setAttribute('data-state','playing');       c.setAttribute('aria-pressed','true');       el.parentNode.replaceChild(c, el);     } else {       el.setAttribute('data-state','stopped');       el.setAttribute('aria-pressed','false');       el.src = el.getAttribute('data-still');     }   })(this)" onkeydown="if(event.key===' '||event.key==='Enter'){event.preventDefault();this.onclick(event);}"></p>
<p>OK, this particular GIF is terrible, but the great thing about skills is that they’re very easy to iterate on to make them better.</p>
<p>Here are some noteworthy snippets from <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/ef35bb9e6c514d1d596dac9227da482b">the Python script it wrote</a>, comments mine:</p>
<pre><span># Start by adding the skill's directory to the Python path</span>
<span>import</span> <span>sys</span>
<span>sys</span>.<span>path</span>.<span>insert</span>(<span>0</span>, <span>'/mnt/skills/examples/slack-gif-creator'</span>)

<span># This class lives in the core/ directory for the skill</span>
<span>from</span> <span>core</span>.<span>gif_builder</span> <span>import</span> <span>GIFBuilder</span>

<span># ... code that builds the GIF ...</span>

<span># Save it to disk:</span>
<span>info</span> <span>=</span> <span>builder</span>.<span>save</span>(<span>'/mnt/user-data/outputs/skills_vs_mcps.gif'</span>, 
                    <span>num_colors</span><span>=</span><span>128</span>, 
                    <span>optimize_for_emoji</span><span>=</span><span>False</span>)

<span>print</span>(<span>f"GIF created successfully!"</span>)
<span>print</span>(<span>f"Size: <span><span>{</span><span>info</span>[<span>'size_kb'</span>]:.1f<span>}</span></span> KB (<span><span>{</span><span>info</span>[<span>'size_mb'</span>]:.2f<span>}</span></span> MB)"</span>)
<span>print</span>(<span>f"Frames: <span><span>{</span><span>info</span>[<span>'frame_count'</span>]<span>}</span></span>"</span>)
<span>print</span>(<span>f"Duration: <span><span>{</span><span>info</span>[<span>'duration_seconds'</span>]:.1f<span>}</span></span>s"</span>)

<span># Use the check_slack_size() function to confirm it's small enough for Slack:</span>
<span>passes</span>, <span>check_info</span> <span>=</span> <span>check_slack_size</span>(<span>'/mnt/user-data/outputs/skills_vs_mcps.gif'</span>, <span>is_emoji</span><span>=</span><span>False</span>)
<span>if</span> <span>passes</span>:
    <span>print</span>(<span>"✓ Ready for Slack!"</span>)
<span>else</span>:
    <span>print</span>(<span>f"⚠ File size: <span><span>{</span><span>check_info</span>[<span>'size_kb'</span>]:.1f<span>}</span></span> KB (limit: <span><span>{</span><span>check_info</span>[<span>'limit_kb'</span>]<span>}</span></span> KB)"</span>)</pre>
<p>This is pretty neat. Slack GIFs need to be a maximum of 2MB, so the skill includes a validation function which the model can use to check the file size. If it’s too large the model can have another go at making it smaller.</p>
<h4 id="skills-depend-on-a-coding-environment">Skills depend on a coding environment</h4>
<p>The skills mechanism is <em>entirely dependent</em> on the model having access to a filesystem, tools to navigate it and the ability to execute commands in that environment.</p>
<p>This is a common pattern for LLM tooling these days—ChatGPT Code Interpreter was the first big example of this <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Apr/12/code-interpreter/">back in early 2023</a>, and the pattern later extended to local machines via coding agent tools such as Cursor, Claude Code, Codex CLI and Gemini CLI.</p>
<p>This requirement is the biggest difference between skills and other previous attempts at expanding the abilities of LLMs, such as MCP and <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/chatgpt-plugins/">ChatGPT Plugins</a>. It’s a significant dependency, but it’s somewhat bewildering how much new capability it unlocks.</p>
<p>The fact that skills are so powerful and simple to create is yet another argument in favor of making safe coding environments available to LLMs. The word <strong>safe</strong> there is doing a <em>lot</em> of work though! We really need to figure out how best to sandbox these environments such that attacks such as prompt injections are limited to an acceptable amount of damage.</p>
<h4 id="claude-as-a-general-agent">Claude Code as a General Agent</h4>
<p>Back in January I <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jan/10/ai-predictions/">made some foolhardy predictions about AI/LLMs</a>, including that “agents” would once again fail to happen:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think we are going to see a <em>lot</em> more froth about agents in 2025, but I expect the results will be a great disappointment to most of the people who are excited about this term. I expect a lot of money will be lost chasing after several different poorly defined dreams that share that name.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was entirely wrong about that. 2025 really has been the year of “agents”, no matter which of the many <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/agent-definitions/">conflicting definitions</a> you decide to use (I eventually settled on "<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/18/agents/">tools in a loop</a>").</p>
<p><a href="https://www.claude.com/product/claude-code">Claude Code</a> is, with hindsight, poorly named. It’s not purely a coding tool: it’s a tool for general computer automation. <em>Anything</em> you can achieve by typing commands into a computer is something that can now be automated by Claude Code. It’s best described as a <strong>general agent</strong>. Skills make this a whole lot more obvious and explicit.</p>
<p>I find the potential applications of this trick somewhat dizzying. Just thinking about this with my data journalism hat on: imagine a folder full of skills that covers tasks like the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where to get US census data from and how to understand its structure</li>
<li>How to load data from different formats into SQLite or DuckDB using appropriate Python libraries</li>
<li>How to publish data online, as Parquet files in S3 or pushed as tables to Datasette Cloud</li>
<li>A skill defined by an experienced data reporter talking about how best to find the interesting stories in a new set of data</li>
<li>A skill that describes how to build clean, readable data visualizations using D3</li>
</ul>
<p>Congratulations, you just built a “data journalism agent” that can discover and help publish stories against fresh drops of US census data. And you did it with a folder full of Markdown files and maybe a couple of example Python scripts.</p>
<h4 id="skills-compared-to-mcp">Skills compared to MCP</h4>
<p><a href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io/">Model Context Protocol</a> has attracted an enormous amount of buzz since its initial release back <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Nov/25/model-context-protocol/">in November last year</a>. I like to joke that one of the reasons it took off is that every company knew they needed an “AI strategy”, and building (or announcing) an MCP implementation was an easy way to tick that box.</p>
<p>Over time the limitations of MCP have started to emerge. The most significant is in terms of token usage: GitHub’s official MCP on its own famously consumes tens of thousands of tokens of context, and once you’ve added a few more to that there’s precious little space left for the LLM to actually do useful work.</p>
<p>My own interest in MCPs has waned ever since I started taking coding agents seriously. Almost everything I might achieve with an MCP can be handled by a CLI tool instead. LLMs know how to call <code>cli-tool --help</code>, which means you don’t have to spend many tokens describing how to use them—the model can figure it out later when it needs to.</p>
<p>Skills have exactly the same advantage, only now I don’t even need to implement a new CLI tool. I can drop a Markdown file in describing how to do a task instead, adding extra scripts only if they’ll help make things more reliable or efficient.</p>
<h4 id="here-come-the-skills">Here come the Skills</h4>
<p>One of the most exciting things about Skills is how easy they are to share. I expect many skills will be implemented as a single file—more sophisticated ones will be a folder with a few more.</p>
<p>Anthropic have <a href="https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview">Agent Skills documentation</a> and a <a href="https://github.com/anthropics/claude-cookbooks/tree/main/skills">Claude Skills Cookbook</a>. I’m already thinking through ideas of skills I might build myself, like one on <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/8/claude-datasette-plugins/">how to build Datasette plugins</a>.</p>
<p>Something else I love about the design of skills is there is nothing at all preventing them from being used with other models.</p>
<p>You can grab a skills folder right now, point Codex CLI or Gemini CLI at it and say “read pdf/SKILL.md and then create me a PDF describing this project” and it will work, despite those tools and models having no baked in knowledge of the skills system.</p>
<p>I expect we’ll see a Cambrian explosion in Skills which will make this year’s MCP rush look pedestrian by comparison.</p>
<h4 id="the-simplicity-is-the-point">The simplicity is the point</h4>
<p>I’ve seen a some push back against skills as being so simple they’re hardly a feature at all. Plenty of people have experimented with the trick of dropping extra instructions into a Markdown file and telling the coding agent to read that file before continuing with a task. <a href="https://agents.md/">AGENTS.md</a> is a well established pattern, and that file can already include instructions to “Read PDF.md before attempting to create a PDF”.</p>
<p>The core simplicity of the skills design is why I’m so excited about it.</p>
<p>MCP is a whole <a href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18">protocol specification</a>, covering hosts, clients, servers, resources, prompts, tools, sampling, roots, elicitation and three different transports (stdio, streamable HTTP and originally SSE).</p>
<p>Skills are Markdown with a tiny bit of YAML metadata and some optional scripts in whatever you can make executable in the environment. They feel a lot closer to the spirit of LLMs—throw in some text and let the model figure it out.</p>
<p>They outsource the hard parts to the LLM harness and the associated computer environment. Given everything we have learned about LLMs’ ability to run tools over the last couple of years I think that’s a very sensible strategy.</p>
