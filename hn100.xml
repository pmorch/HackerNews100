    The Ashet Home Computer is an expandable and hackable computer in the spirit of the 80's home computers.

    Fully understandable by a single person, yet powerful enough to run a graphical desktop OS, it tries to bridge the gap between Arduinos and a RaspberryPi.

    It is designed and engineered for fun and learning, which go best hand in hand.
  </p><div><h2>Project Status &amp; Roadmap</h2><h3><img src="https://ashet.computer/img/check.svg"> Design</h3><p>The Ashet Home Computer has completed its design phase, and a practical, achievable hardware concept is now finalized.</p><p>There are still many smaller design components to be refined, but the overall concept is done.</p><p><em>Check out the <a href="https://ashet.computer/hardware/">hardware design</a> to learn more about the system.</em></p><h3><img src="https://ashet.computer/img/check.svg"> Prototyping</h3><p>A functional <em>cable clutter prototype</em> has been created which validates all of the design ideas.</p><p>This includes:</p><ul><li>PSRAM Support</li><li>DVI Video Generation</li><li>Backplane Communication</li><li>Expansion Card Drivers</li><li>Ethernet</li><li>I²C Subsystem</li></ul><p>Currently, the RP2350 processor successfully boots the operating system and supports launching desktop applications.</p><p>The mechanical design is also validated by building a mock-up of the final hardware and case assembly.</p><p><em>Check out the prototype images and videos in the <a href="https://ashet.computer/gallery/#home-computer-photo">gallery</a>!</em></p><h3><img src="https://ashet.computer/img/wrench-clock.svg"> Engineering</h3><p>The next stage after prototyping will be the actual engineering. This includes creating schematics, pcb layouts, evaluation of hardware limits and EMI emissions.</p><p>In this phase, the fully production-ready computer will be built.</p><p>To fund development for this critical next stage, we will launch a crowdfunding campaign on a platform such as Indiegogo or Kickstarter.</p><p><em>Subscribe to our <a href="https://buttondown.com/ashet.computer" target="_blank">newsletter</a> to get notified when the fundraiser starts!</em></p><h3><img src="https://ashet.computer/img/wrench-clock.svg"> Production &amp; Release</h3><p>In parallel to the engineering, a manufacturing partner must be found that will produce and distribute the Ashet Home Computer.</p><p>One of the goals is to make the computer available for 250€ or less, but if that’s possible depends on so many details that it’s hard to tell in the current phase.</p><p>No matter what’s the outcome of this phase, the whole computer design will be available for free under a <em>permissive&nbsp;licence</em> and can be built by everyone.</p></div></div>]]></description>

</div>   <div><p>A proposed <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/topic/department-of-homeland-security" data-sys="1">Department of Homeland Security</a> rule that would alter how H-1B visas are allocated has cleared review by the White House's Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA), according to <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/topic/bloomberg" data-sys="1">Bloomberg</a> Law.</p><p>Federal regulators cleared a proposed rule that would apply a "weighted selection process" by replacing the current random lottery with a new system that gives priority in the selection process to registrants who meet or exceed certain criteria, such as wage or education level.</p><p><em>Newsweek</em> reached out to the DHS and the OIRA for comment.</p><h2><strong>Why It Matters</strong></h2><p>The H-1B program supplies tens of thousands of specialty-occupation workers to U.S. employers each year and is heavily used by the technology sector. Any shift from a random lottery to a weighted, wage- or skill-based system could change hiring incentives for employers, affecting which foreign professionals obtain U.S. work authorization.</p><p>The H-1B cap of 85,000 slots annually influences employers' ability to hire specialized foreign workers in fields including engineering, computer science and business specialties. Any change to the selection criteria could incentivize employers to offer higher wages to improve odds in a weighted system or change recruitment strategies.</p><figure><div>

</figcaption>  </figure><h2><strong>What To Know</strong></h2><p>Federal review clearance by the OIRA typically preceded publication of a proposed rule in the Federal Register and a public comment period. The next step is a Federal Register publication, followed by a 30- to 60-day comment window and a multistep process before any final rule could take effect.</p><p>The proposed weighted-selection concept echoes a 2021 DHS plan under President <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/topic/donald-trump" data-sys="1">Donald Trump</a>'s first administration that had sought to rank and select petitions by wage tiers (OES wage levels IV down to I), an approach that the Trump administration argued would prioritize higher-paid, highly skilled hires. That earlier plan faced opposition, was withdrawn by the Biden administration and saw related regulations blocked in federal court.</p><p>The Institute for Progress, a nonpartisan think tank examining innovation policy, earlier this year suggested eliminating the H-1B lottery. It argued that the economic value of the visa program could be increased by 88 percent if applicants were evaluated based on seniority or salary.</p><p>The H-1B visa has come under increasing scrutiny since Trump assumed office in January, as the president's supporters have called into question the number of visas handed out to foreign nationals at what they claim is the expense of American workers. For example, <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/microsoft-layoffs-h1b-visa-applications-2094370" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft is under growing pressure</a> to account for its H-1B visa requests while the company has issued major layoffs in recent months.</p><p>The Washington-based tech giant applied for 9,491 H-1B visas during the last fiscal year, all of which were approved. The company has laid off nearly 16,000 people in total this year, out of a 228,000-strong global employee base.</p><h2><strong>What People Are Saying</strong></h2><p><strong>U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services agency guidance, July 18, 2025:</strong> "USCIS has announced that it has received enough petitions to meet the congressionally mandated 65,000 H-1B visa regular cap and the 20,000 H-1B visa U.S. advanced degree exemption, also known as the master's cap, for fiscal year 2026."</p><p><strong>Immigration attorneys Fragomen LLP, in an August 11 article:</strong> "The next step for the proposal is publication in the Federal Register for public feedback."</p><h2><strong>What Happens Next</strong></h2><p>Industry advisers and regulatory watchers expected the administration to publish the proposed rule in the Federal Register, which would trigger a formal public comment period.</p><p>A proposed rule overhauling the allocation of H-1B visas for specialty occupation workers was approved by a key White House office, signaling it may be released publicly soon.</p>  </div></div>   <div data-pollid="7" data-articleid="2112216" data-gtm-category="FairnessMeter" data-gtmaction="original"><div><div>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="ArticlePageChunks"><figure data-testid="cne-audio-embed-figure"></figure><p>When <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/12/04/how-jensen-huangs-nvidia-is-powering-the-ai-revolution">Jensen Huang</a>, the chief executive of the chipmaker Nvidia, met with <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a> in the White House last week, he had reason to be cheerful. Most of Nvidia’s chips, which are widely used to train generative artificial-intelligence models, are manufactured in Asia. Earlier this year, it pledged to increase production in the United States, and on Wednesday Trump announced that chip companies that promise to build products in the United States would be exempt from some hefty new tariffs on semiconductors that his Administration is preparing to impose. The next day, Nvidia’s stock hit a new all-time high, and its market capitalization reached $4.4 trillion, making it the world’s most valuable company, ahead of Microsoft, which is also heavily involved in A.I.</p><p>Welcome to the A.I. boom, or should I say the A.I. bubble? It has been more than a quarter of a century since the bursting of the great dot-com bubble, during which hundreds of unprofitable internet startups issued stock on the Nasdaq, and the share prices of many tech companies rose into the stratosphere. In March and April of 2000, tech stocks plummeted; subsequently many, but by no means all, of the internet startups went out of business. There has been some discussion on Wall Street in the past few months about whether the current surge in tech is following a similar trajectory. In a <a data-offer-url="https://www.goldmansachs.com/pdfs/insights/goldman-sachs-research/25-years-on-lessons-from-the-bursting-of-the-tech-bubble/redaction.pdf" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.goldmansachs.com/pdfs/insights/goldman-sachs-research/25-years-on-lessons-from-the-bursting-of-the-tech-bubble/redaction.pdf&quot;}" href="https://www.goldmansachs.com/pdfs/insights/goldman-sachs-research/25-years-on-lessons-from-the-bursting-of-the-tech-bubble/redaction.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">research paper</a> entitled “25 Years On; Lessons from the Bursting of the Technology Bubble,” which was published in March, a team of investment analysts from Goldman Sachs argued that it wasn’t: “While enthusiasm for technology stocks has risen sharply in recent years, this has not represented a bubble because the price appreciation has been justified by strong profit fundamentals.” The analysts pointed to the earnings power of the so-called Magnificent Seven companies: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla. Between the first quarter of 2022 and the first quarter of this year, Nvidia’s revenues quintupled, and its after-tax profits rose more than tenfold.</p><p>The Goldman paper also provided a salutary history lesson. Between 1995 and 2000, it pointed out, the tech-heavy Nasdaq index rose fivefold, and at the peak of the market a widely used valuation measure for the stocks that trade on it—the price-to-earnings ratio, or “P/E”—topped a hundred and fifty, a level not seen before or since then. By comparison, the five-year period from March, 2020, to March, 2025, had been relatively tame. It’s true, the Nasdaq had roughly doubled, and the P/E ratio had gone up considerably; but it hadn’t got anywhere near three figures.</p><p>Having written <a data-offer-url="https://www.amazon.com/Dot-America-Lost-Money-Internet/dp/0060008814" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Dot-America-Lost-Money-Internet/dp/0060008814&quot;}" href="https://www.amazon.com/Dot-America-Lost-Money-Internet/dp/0060008814" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-aps-asin="0060008814" data-aps-asc-tag="">extensively</a> on the dot-com boom and bust, I found some of Goldman’s analysis persuasive. Many people have either forgotten, or are too young to remember, the extremes reached during the dot-com years. In the logic of speculative hysterias—from the seventeenth-century “tulipmania” in Holland to the rise of Pets.com—greed, <em>FOMO</em>, and the greater-fool theory of investing eventually combine to banish caution, common sense, and financial gravity. Back in March, there was plenty of <em>FOMO</em> and trend-following on Wall Street, but it hadn’t reached the levels of the late nineties. Five months on, however, echoes of the dot-com era are getting louder.</p><p>Consider Palantir Technologies, whose A.I. software is used by the Pentagon, the C.I.A., and <em>ICE</em>, not to mention by many commercial companies. A couple of days before Huang visited the White House, Palantir released a positive earnings report. By the end of the week, according to the Yahoo Finance database, the market was valuing the company at more than six hundred times its earnings from the past twelve months, and at about a hundred and thirty times its sales in that same time span. Even during the late nineties, figures like these would have raised eyebrows.</p><p>Eye-popping I.P.O.s, another feature of the dot-com era, are also making a comeback. At the end of July, Figma, a firm that makes software used by internet developers, and which has added A.I. features to its suite of products, issued stock on the New York Stock Exchange at thirty-three dollars a share. When trading started, the price jumped to eighty-five. It closed the day at $115.50—a two-hundred-and-fifty-per-cent gain on the offering price. Watching this market action, I was reminded of August 9, 1995, when Netscape, which made the Netscape Navigator web browser, went public. Its stock was priced at twenty-eight dollars, rose to seventy-five, and closed at $58.25. In percentage terms, this leap was smaller than the first-day rise in Figma’s stock, but it’s often described as the beginning of the dot-com bubble.</p><p>It should be noted that, since Figma’s I.P.O., its stock has fallen back to below eighty dollars. This could be interpreted as a sign of sanity prevailing, but, given that the shares are still trading at more than double the offering price, other privately owned A.I. companies will be encouraged to enter the stock market. Renaissance Capital, a research firm that specializes in I.P.O.s, lists eight prominent candidates: OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere, Databricks, SymphonyAI, Waymo, Scale AI, and Perplexity. Almost all of these companies are unicorns: they have been valued at more than a billion dollars in fund-raising deals with venture capitalists and other early investors. But, across the country, according to the research firm Tracxn, there are about seven thousand smaller and lesser-known A.I. companies, more than a thousand of which have already received Series A funding from external backers to finance their operations.</p><p>The ready availability of early-stage funding means that a necessary condition for a dot-com-style bubble is in place. So are three more: excitement among investors about a pathbreaking technology—generative A.I. clearly has the potential to impact great swaths of the economy; a Wall Street production line staffed by investment bankers eager to earn fees for organizing I.P.O.s; and accommodative policy. Last month, the Trump Administration announced an “<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Americas-AI-Action-Plan.pdf">AI Action Plan</a>,” which aims to remove barriers to the deployment of the new technology and to deter individual states from introducing “burdensome” regulatory A.I. laws. The Federal Reserve, meanwhile, appears to be preparing to <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-financial-page/donald-trumps-war-with-jerome-powell-and-the-fed-is-far-from-over">cut interest rates</a> next month, which could give another boost to the markets.</p><p>There are, however, some important differences between now and the nineties, one of which is that the online economy is no longer a vast open plain on which enterprising individuals can propose to build castles to the sky. It is a redoubt of monopoly capitalism, in which Big Tech dominates the horizon. During the dot-com era, or its early stages, anyway, small startups could reasonably hope to exploit first-mover advantage, gain early traction, and create durable business franchises. In the A.I. economy, it seems possible that many of the rewards will go to top firms that can afford to build and maintain large A.I. models and can use their market power and financial might to ward off, or buy out, potential competitors. A vigorous antitrust policy could perhaps prevent this from happening, but, as the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> <a data-offer-url="https://www.wsj.com/us-news/law/maga-antitrust-agenda-under-siege-by-lobbyists-close-to-trump-18558898" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.wsj.com/us-news/law/maga-antitrust-agenda-under-siege-by-lobbyists-close-to-trump-18558898&quot;}" href="https://www.wsj.com/us-news/law/maga-antitrust-agenda-under-siege-by-lobbyists-close-to-trump-18558898" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">reported</a> last week, the Administration’s pledge to pursue such a policy is now under threat from lobbyists and power brokers with close ties to the President. If investors decide that monopolies are the future of the A.I.-driven economy, the outcome in the stock market could well mean further gains for existing industry giants rather than a broad-based bubble.</p><p>All of this is uncertain, of course. The A.I. boom is still in the stage of building out infrastructure—training large language models, building data centers, and so on. A.I. applications are just beginning to diffuse throughout the economy, and nobody knows for sure just how transformative, and profitable, the technology will be. In this environment, many investors are following the time-honored gold-rush strategy of buying the shovel-makers and big mine owners. But history teaches us that even this strategy is far from risk-free. In an interesting analysis that was posted on the financial-news platform Seeking Alpha, an analyst identified as KCI Research compared Nvidia to Cisco Systems, one of the firms whose stock went parabolic in 1998-99. Just as Nvidia’s G.P.U.s (graphics-processing units) are now widely regarded as must-have components of A.I. infrastructure, Cisco’s routers and other network equipment were viewed as essential components of the internet build-out; for a time, demand for them seemed virtually unlimited. Like Nvidia, Cisco was an innovative and highly profitable company. But, in April of 2000, its stock dropped by almost forty per cent, and a year later it had fallen by about eighty per cent. A quarter of a century on, it still hasn’t recovered the high it hit in early 2000, although, lately, it has come close.</p><p>The Nvidia-Cisco comparison was a useful reminder of a dictum from the pioneering stock analyst Benjamin Graham, who was a mentor to Warren Buffett: in the short run, the stock market is a voting machine, but in the long run it is a weighing machine that weighs the cash flows that companies generate. Ironically, the Nvidia-Cisco analogy also inadvertently demonstrated how long the short run can last for, and how dangerous it can be to predict its end date. The analysis was posted in February of last year. Since then, Nvidia’s stock price has risen by another hundred and fifty per cent.&nbsp;♦</p></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://blog.wilsonl.in/search-engine/">https://blog.wilsonl.in/search-engine/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44878151">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><header><p><time datetime="2025-08-10T00:00:00.000Z">Published August 10, 2025</time><span>34 min read</span></p></header>
<a href="https://blog.wilsonl.in/search-engine/serp-rocksdb.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://blog.wilsonl.in/search-engine/serp-rocksdb.png" alt="Screenshot of SERP."></a>
<p>A while back, I decided to undertake a project to challenge myself: build a web search engine from scratch. Aside from the fun deep dive opportunity, there were two motivators:</p>
<ul>
<li>Search engines seemed to be getting worse, with more SEO spam and less relevant quality content.</li>
<li>Transformer-based <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener">text embedding models</a> were taking off and showing amazing natural comprehension of language.</li>
</ul>
<p>A simple question I had was: why couldn't a search engine <em>always</em> result in top quality content? Such content may be rare, but the Internet's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_tail" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tail is long</a>, and better quality results should rank higher than the prolific inorganic content and engagement bait you see today.</p>
<p>Another pain point was that search engines often felt underpowered, closer to keyword matching than human-level intelligence. A reasonably complex or subtle query couldn't be answered by most search engines at all, but the ability to would be powerful:</p>
<a href="https://blog.wilsonl.in/search-engine/serp-paragraph-cropped.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://blog.wilsonl.in/search-engine/serp-paragraph-cropped.png" alt="SERP result of paragraph-length query."></a>
<p>Search engines cover broad areas of computer science, linguistics, ontology, NLP, ML, distributed systems, performance engineering, and so on. I thought it'd be interesting to see how much I could learn and cover in a short period. Plus, it'd be cool to have my own search engine. Given all these points, I dived right in.</p>
<p>In this post, I go over the 2-month journey end-to-end, starting from no infra, bootstrapped data, or any experience around building a web search engine. Some highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>A cluster of 200 GPUs generated a combined 3 billion <a href="https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/multi-qa-mpnet-base-dot-v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SBERT</a> embeddings.</li>
<li>At peak, hundreds of crawlers ingested 50K pages per second, culminating in an index of 280 million.</li>
<li>End-to-end query latency landed around 500 ms.</li>
<li>RocksDB and HNSW were <a href="https://blog.wilsonl.in/corenn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sharded</a> across 200 cores, 4 TB of RAM, and 82 TB of SSDs.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can play around with a deployed instance of this search engine as a <a href="#live-demo">live demo</a>. Here's a high-level architecture map of the system that will be covered in this post:</p>

<p>I started off by creating a minimal playground to experiment if <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener">neural embeddings</a> were superior for search: take some web page, chunk it up, and see if I can answer complex indirect natural language queries with precision.</p>
<p>As an example, let's say I'm looking at the S3 documentation. Here are how some queries are answered by current systems, and how I envisioned they should be answered:</p>






























<div><table><thead><tr><th>Query</th><th>Traditional search</th><th>Neural search</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>i want to use s3 instead of postgres but with databases i can tag some human comment with some file in another column</td><td><em>Random results about Postgres, S3, files</em></td><td>You can also specify custom metadata at the time that the object is stored.</td></tr><tr><td>why does CORS still not work after allowing all?</td><td><em>Random snippet about CORS, "S3 not working", object permissions</em></td><td>Bucket configurations have an eventual consistency model...</td></tr><tr><td>could files get lost or corrupted?</td><td><em>(No result shown)</em></td><td>If a PUT request is successful, your data is safely stored.</td></tr><tr><td>can i use s3 from lua?</td><td><em>(No result shown)</em></td><td>The architecture of Amazon S3 is designed to be programming language-neutral, ... With the REST API, you use standard HTTP requests to create, fetch, and delete buckets and objects.</td></tr></tbody></table></div>
<p>Basically, the search engine should understand <em>intent</em>, not <em>keywords</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Queries are understood as a whole instead of broken down into keywords and phrases.</li>
<li>No need for query engineering: operators, format, right words to use.</li>
<li>"Tip of the tongue", implicit, and conceptual queries are mapped correctly to the right answer.</li>
<li>You can ask multi-concept, complex, nuanced queries and surface non-obvious relationships.</li>
<li>It should be far less susceptible to keyword spam and SEO tactics.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is already great for searches in general. But it'd also be great for finding insights, unnoticed connections, and hidden gems. You can ask some very sophisticated specific query, and the search engine will surface a <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/needle_in_a_haystack" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one-line sentence</a> in an obscure quality essay. You could write a paragraph of your thoughts and views, and find other writers and areas with similar perspectives. You could query with phrases that signal quality and depth, to find content and communities of similar values.</p>
<p>Here's the sandbox flywheel I initially created to prove the concept:</p>
<ol>
<li>Grow set of gathered diverse raw web pages.</li>
<li>Parse, normalize, augment, and embed them into a queryable HNSW index.</li>
<li>Build and expand the test dataset of queries as I crawl, debug, experiment, and eval.</li>
<li>Create a UI to introspect data at each stage, see failure points, and tune.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="normalization">Normalization</h2>
<p>HTML represents content in tags which have various intents: layout, text, media, interactivity, metadata, and app programming. Since a search engine focuses on text content, the first step of any pipeline is to sanitize and regularize the noisy markup from a crawled page and extract out semantic text. <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WHATWG</a> already defines plenty of semantic elements and rules, which I subsetted into the following mini-spec:</p>
<ul>
<li>Structures should be consistent: <code>table &gt; (thead, tbody, tfoot) &gt; tr &gt; (th, td)</code>; <code>(ul, ol) &gt; li</code>.</li>
<li>Only semantic text elements should be kept: <code>p, table, pre, blockquote, ul, ol, dl</code>.</li>
<li>Text is trimmed and collapsed; no loose or unexpected text nodes outside of <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>.</li>
<li>Flatten text trees so that retrieving and mutating text spans (which happens often) doesn't require traversing and reconciling trees.</li>
<li>Remove or unwrap as many nodes as possible: scripts, attributes, empty elements, <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>, comment nodes, foreign/layout elements.</li>
<li>If <code>main &gt; article</code> exists, use it instead of whole page.</li>
</ul>
<p>One goal is to remove all of the <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/browser-and-gui-chrome/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chrome</a> on a page as they're not part of the content, which pollute the context and distort meaning:</p>
<ul>
<li>Menu bars, nav links, banners, footers, site information.</li>
<li>Comments sections, asides, links to other articles.</li>
<li>Interface elements, forms, controls, social media buttons.</li>
</ul>
<p>These can get mixed up with the primary content and dilute the search engine's understanding of the page's actual content and intent, causing poor query results.</p>
<p>Removing these is straightforward if the page uses <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/curriculum/core/semantic-html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">semantic elements</a> like <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> or <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ARIA roles</a>, but otherwise devolves into heuristics and NLP. Methods like pattern matching on classes and IDs is fraught, and removing content by accident is worse than keeping in noise. More advanced methods like <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/chromium/headless" target="_blank" rel="noopener">visually</a> classifying DOM structure or training <a href="https://fasttext.cc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">statistical text models</a> are possible given more time and resources.</p>
<p>Given HTML's laxness, many sites don't follow these rules rigorously, so you get undercoverage and overcoverage. Unfortunately, this even applies to some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">big</a> sites that could not be ignored, so I had to hard code some special rules for them (<a href="https://github.com/WebKit/WebKit/blob/main/Source/WebCore/page/Quirks.cpp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">much like a well-known browser</a>).</p>

<p>There's a lot of rich structured data available on many pages. <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> tags like <a href="https://ogp.me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OpenGraph</a> are well-known. There's also an entire <a href="https://schema.org/docs/gs.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spec</a> to representing <a href="https://schema.org/docs/full.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">almost anything</a> in a web page for robots to consume. Search engines use these to power <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/search-gallery" target="_blank" rel="noopener">enhanced rich results</a> and build their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_Graph_(Google)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">knowledge graphs</a>. It's how they know something is mentioning a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs_(film)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">movie</a> and not a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs_(book)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">book</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">person</a> to improve relevancy, discover new emerging <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology" target="_blank" rel="noopener">things</a> in the world, and show fancy shopping, rating, carousel, and "near me" results.</p>
<h2 id="chunking">Chunking</h2>
<p>Once the text is ready, the next step is to <a href="https://www.pinecone.io/learn/chunking-strategies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chunk it</a>. Most embedding models can't take in whole-page inputs and tend to <a href="https://jina.ai/news/long-context-embedding-models-are-blind-beyond-4k-tokens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lose representational power at such lengths</a> anyway. Embedding at the page level is also too coarse, not helpful for pinpointing.</p>
<p>A common approach is to simply split at every <em>n</em> characters or words. But this can crudely cut off words, grammar, and structure that destroy meaning. My approach was to break into sentences, a natural coherent boundary, using a trained <a href="https://spacy.io/api/sentencizer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sentencizer</a>. These models are trained on a large corpus of texts and have a good understanding of grammar and syntax for high accuracy. I found spaCy's model to work the best here, handling subtleties like abbreviations, decimals, URLs, and informal style grammar.</p>
<p>It seemed to me that breaking into sentences would be a good atomic unit of detail: enough to pinpoint the exact relevant part or answer to a query, useful for featured direct snippets or result highlights. This would also allow building larger embedding units (e.g. paragraph sized) with more control over length while still maintaining semantic coherence.</p>
<h3 id="semantic-context">Semantic context</h3>
<p>But a big problem with chunking is context. A sentence builds on top of previous sentences, the containing paragraph, current section, actively discussed concepts, and so on. Indirect references ("it", "the", "then", etc.) lose meaning if chunk is broken off from establishing context.</p>
<p>An initial step was to leverage the normalized semantic document tree. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Headings indicate nesting or splitting sections; the content under a <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> is associated with that heading's text.</li>
<li>Table headings indicate labels for cells in each row; paragraphs indicate semantic text break points; <code>&lt;dd&gt;</code> is associated with its <code>&lt;dt&gt;</code>; and so on.</li>
<li>A "leading" sentence like <em>Here are the suggested values:</em> before a list explains what that list is and so would be associated with that list.</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, a page like:</p>
<blockquote>
<h2 id="postgresql-performance-tuning-guide">PostgreSQL Performance Tuning Guide</h2>
<p>…</p>
<h2 id="connection-settings">Connection Settings</h2>
<p>…</p>
<h3 id="maximum-connections">Maximum connections</h3>
<p>Each connection uses a new process. This is different to most other database systems. Therefore, the setting may have surprising performance impact. Due to this design, connections use more resources than in a thread-based system, and so require extra consideration. Here are some recommended values:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are using version 16 or greater:






























<div><table><thead><tr><th>Environment</th><th>Recommended Setting</th><th>…</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Development</td><td>100</td><td>…</td></tr><tr><td>Web Application</td><td>200-400</td><td>…</td></tr><tr><td>Data Warehouse</td><td>50-100</td><td>…</td></tr><tr><td>Microservices</td><td>20-50 per service</td><td>…</td></tr></tbody></table></div>
</li>
<li>If you are using version 15:






























<div><table><thead><tr><th>Environment</th><th>Recommended Setting</th><th>…</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Development</td><td>100</td><td>…</td></tr><tr><td>Web Application</td><td>200-400</td><td>…</td></tr><tr><td>Data Warehouse</td><td>50-100</td><td>…</td></tr><tr><td>Microservices</td><td>20-50 per service</td><td>…</td></tr></tbody></table></div>
</li>
</ul>
<p>…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>would represent the first "Development" table row as</p>
<pre><code><span>[
</span><span>  </span><span>"PostgreSQL Performance Tuning Guide"</span><span>, </span><span>// (heading 1)</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>"Connection Settings"</span><span>, </span><span>// (heading 2)</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>"Maximum connections"</span><span>, </span><span>// (heading 3)</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>"Here are some recommended values:"</span><span>, </span><span>// (leading statement before list)</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>"If you are using version 16 or greater:"</span><span>, </span><span>// (leading statement before table)</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>"Environment: Development | Recommended Setting: 100 | …"</span><span>, </span><span>// denormalized row to provide column headings as context</span><span>
</span><span>].join(</span><span>"\n"</span><span>)
</span></code></pre>
<p>rather than</p>
<pre><code><span>"Development | 100 | …"</span><span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>which loses meaning due to lack of context.</p>
<p>This context also provides disambiguation and relevancy. In the above example, both tables are only differentiated by the version mention before each table.</p>
<h3 id="statement-chaining">Statement chaining</h3>
<p>This doesn't resolve the problem of nearby local context: follow on sentences, anaphora, etc. To tackle this further, I trained a <a href="https://huggingface.co/distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DistilBERT</a> classifier model that would take a sentence and the preceding sentences, and label which one (if any) it depends upon in order to retain meaning. Therefore, when embedding a statement, I would follow the "chain" backwards to ensure all dependents were also provided in context.</p>
<p>This also had the benefit of labelling sentences that should never be matched, because they were not "leaf" sentences by themselves.</p>

<p>Using the previous web page, here is an example:</p>

</span><span>  </span><span>"Connection Settings"</span><span>, </span><span>// heading 2</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>"Maximum connections"</span><span>, </span><span>// heading 3,</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>"Each connection uses a new process."</span><span>, </span><span>// necessary to understand the sentence</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>// ...skipped unnecessary sentences</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>"Due to this design, connections use more resources than in a thread-based system, and so require extra consideration."</span><span>, </span><span>// the target sentence</span><span>
</span><span>].join(</span><span>"\n"</span><span>)
</span></code></pre>
<p>Another example that has multiple hops:</p>
<pre><code><span>[
</span><span>  </span><span>"PostgreSQL Performance Tuning Guide"</span><span>, </span><span>// heading 1</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>"Connection Settings"</span><span>, </span><span>// heading 2</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>"Maximum connections"</span><span>, </span><span>// heading 3</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>"Each connection uses a new process."</span><span>, </span><span>// to understand the next line</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>"This is different to most other database systems."</span><span>, </span><span>// to understand the next line</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>"Therefore, the setting may have surprising performance impact."</span><span>, </span><span>// the target sentence</span><span>
</span><span>].join(</span><span>"\n"</span><span>)

<h2 id="initial-results">Initial results</h2>
<p>I built a UX to visualize and interact with pages in my sandbox and test out queries. The results seemed to be pretty good.</p>
<p>For example, on <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/mpuoverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this S3 documentation page</a>, using a natural language question gave multiple relevant direct answers, not just keyword matches, from disparate snippets that weren't simply in sections directly related to the query:</p>

<p>Here's another example, querying <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/understanding-the-anxious-mind/202303/are-you-a-life-optimizer-what-to-do-about-perfectionism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this web page</a>, where the search engine matched against "It's not worth it", which is arguably the most relevant and direct response, but without context would not make sense and therefore not get matched. The other matches also provide more relevant perspectives to the query.</p>

<p>Here are more examples, where the query has very different keywords to their answers, and don't directly refer to them, yet are good matches:</p>

<h2 id="crawler">Crawler</h2>
<p>I felt confident that the pipeline and resulting embeddings deliver good results, so I moved on to building out the actual search engine, starting with a Node.js crawler. Some requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>A form of work stealing for distributing tasks is likely needed as how long requests take varies significantly.</li>
<li>Trust nothing: control and verify DNS resolution, URLs, redirects, headers, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slowloris_(cyber_attack)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">timers</a>.</li>
<li>Origins often rate limit by IP, so tasks should be distributed across crawlers and handle origin-specific rate limits.</li>
<li>Lots of requests = lots of potential memory leaks. Manage resources (sockets, keepalives, pools) strictly, and use streaming wherever possible to keep memory O(1).</li>
</ul>
<p>The approach ended up being:</p>
<ul>
<li>up to N-per-origin concurrent Promises, which are essentially green threads as primary workload is async I/O</li>
<li>self-imposed sliding window and concurrency rate limiting per origin, with jittered delays between requests and exponential backoff between failures</li>
<li>use Node.js streams to fetch, decompress, and ingest in fixed-sized buffers for memory usage stability</li>
</ul>
<p>Each node grabs a diverse set of URLs from the DB across domains, which is then randomly work-stolen across green threads. This multi-level stochastic queues setup reduces contention from needing global coordination, frequent polling due to the high-throughput nature, and excessive hitting of any single origin, compared to simply ordered polling from a global crawl queue.</p>
<p>Origins that are rate limited get excluded when polling for more URLs, and existing polled tasks get sent back to global queue.</p>
<a href="https://blog.wilsonl.in/search-engine/multi-level-crawl-queues.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://blog.wilsonl.in/search-engine/multi-level-crawl-queues.png" alt="Diagram of multi-level crawl queues."></a>
<p>A surprising failure point was DNS. EAI_AGAIN and SERVFAIL caused a non-insignificant amount of failures. DNS resolution for every crawl was done manually to verify that the resolved IP was not a private IP, to avoid leaking internal data.</p>
<p>There's a surprising amount of detail that I overlook normally. For example, URLs seem straightforward, but can actually be subtle to deal with. All URLs, before entering the system, were strictly processed as they were central to many systems and records:</p>
<ul>
<li>They must have <code>https:</code> protocol, not <code>ftp:</code>, <code>data:</code>, <code>javascript:</code>, etc.</li>
<li>They must have a valid <a href="https://publicsuffix.org/list/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eTLD</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostname#Syntax" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hostname</a>, and can't have ports, usernames, or passwords.</li>
<li>Canonicalization is done to deduplicate. All components are percent-decoded then re-encoded with a minimal consistent charset. Query parameters are dropped or sorted. Origins are lowercased.</li>
<li>Some URLs are extremely long, and you can run into rare limits like HTTP headers and database index page sizes.</li>
<li>Some URLs also have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C0_and_C1_control_codes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strange characters</a> that you wouldn't think would be in a URL, but will get rejected downstream by systems like <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype-character.html#:~:text=the%20character%20with%20code%20zero%20(sometimes%20called%20NUL)%20cannot%20be%20stored" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PostgreSQL</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/APIReference/API_SendMessage.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SQS</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="pipeline">Pipeline</h2>
<a href="https://blog.wilsonl.in/search-engine/pipeline.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://blog.wilsonl.in/search-engine/pipeline.png" alt="Search engine pipeline state and data flow diagram."></a>
<p>Each web page was stored in PostgreSQL with a state shown in the above diagram. Workers would poll from PostgreSQL directly using <code>SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED</code> transactions, transitioning the state once completed. However, lots of long transactions and single-row lock → read → update queries from many distant connections is not efficient with PostgreSQL, so a Rust coordinator service was introduced:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kept entire queue state in memory, and efficiently tracked heartbeats and expiration.</li>
<li>Handled locking, state transitions, and integrity via faster in-memory state.</li>
<li>Used efficient RPC over multiplexed HTTP/2 with clients and only a few PostgreSQL connections to the DB with queued batched upserts.</li>
</ul>
<p>This in-memory queue was designed for high throughput:</p>
<ul>
<li>An <code>Arc&lt;Mutex&lt;Task&gt;&gt;</code> was shared between three data structures:
<ul>
<li>HashMap <code>task ID -&gt; task</code> for fetching and mutating tasks.</li>
<li>Binary heap over tasks, keyed by visibility timeouts, for making expired polled tasks available again.</li>
<li>Grouped by origin (<code>origin</code> -&gt; <code>list of tasks in that origin</code>) for fair scheduling across origins, with separate tracked list of available origins.</li>
<li>Random polling within origin list, with O(1) <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.swap_remove" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>swap_remove</code></a> of self-indexed position (which also means only one other self-indexed position needs updating, no mass shift-down-by-one).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Graceful drift handling was adopted over global locking:
<ul>
<li>Atomicity maintained via per-task locks.</li>
<li>Changes in timeout (e.g. heartbeats) don't mutate heap; instead, the latest expiration is re-checked when background loop goes through timeout heap.</li>
<li>An available origin that becomes empty isn't removed from available origins list until next access (poller), amortizing costs.</li>
<li><code>Arc&lt;Mutex&lt;Task&gt;&gt;</code> is source of truth; data structures are merely indices that may be stale (e.g. completed tasks in heap, empty origins in list, phantom polled task).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The result was efficient sublinear complexity for all operations:</p>








































<div><table><thead><tr><th>Operation</th><th>Time complexity</th><th>Process</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Push task</strong></td><td>O(1)</td><td>HashMap insert + Vec push to origin list + update task's stored index</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Pop random</strong></td><td>O(k) average<br><em>k = excluded origins</em></td><td>O(1) random index into origins list → O(1) random index into origin's tasks<br>→ O(1) swap_remove using stored index → O(log n) heap push</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Complete task</strong></td><td>O(1)</td><td>HashMap lookup → lock task → state transition<br>→ O(1) swap_remove from origin list using stored index</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Heartbeat</strong></td><td>O(1)</td><td>HashMap lookup → update timeout in-place (no heap rebuild)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Release timeouts</strong></td><td>O(log n) per task</td><td>Heap pop → check if expired<br>→ if yes: O(1) push to origin list; if no: O(log n) re-push to heap</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Find task</strong></td><td>O(1)</td><td>Direct HashMap lookup</td></tr></tbody></table></div>
<p>Each task only occupied around 100 bytes of memory, so despite being memory-bound in theory, in reality it was scalable to 1 billion active tasks on a typical 128 GB RAM server.</p>
<p>This also helped with the multi-level stochastic queue setup described previously. Thousands of crawlers all frequently polling a random set of URLs that avoid an arbitrary set of origins, as well as sending back rate limited origin URLs, is a hard database query to optimize for, but more straightforward if global state is kept in memory via a central coordinator.</p>
<p>An interesting optimization was to try and reduce the memory impact of buffering so many URLs in memory:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_interning" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Interning</a>: avoided copies, which was helpful.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zstd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zstd</a>: doesn't work well on small strings, even with custom trained dictionary.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trie</a>: high memory usage in reality due to pointer widths, usize offsets, sparseness, node allocations.</li>
<li>Custom compression algorithm that tries to find patterns in URL components: UUIDs, enums, base64, etc. This was very CPU expensive.</li>
</ul>
<p>Eventually, this in-memory system was retired in favor of a queue service. SQS had very low concurrent rate limits that could not keep up with the throughput of thousands of workers across the pipeline. SQS was also very expensive, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/pricing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">charging per message</a>. I decided to write an <a href="https://github.com/wilsonzlin/queued" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open source RocksDB-based queue</a> that was as simple as SQS, while able to perform 300K operations per second from a single node.</p>
<p>In order to persist the multi-level random/fair scheduling, I appended crawl tasks with a random initial <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-visibility-timeout.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">visibility timeout</a> to approximate shuffling and therefore diversify origins in any sequence of polled tasks. Crawler nodes polled a very large batch rather than one-by-one to continue avoiding excessive global polling via the multi-level queues approach.</p>
<h2 id="storage">Storage</h2>
<p>I initially chose Oracle Cloud for infra needs due to their <a href="https://www.oracle.com/cloud/networking/virtual-cloud-network/pricing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very low egress costs</a> with 10 TB free per month. As I'd store terabytes of data, this was a good reassurance that if I ever needed to move or export data (e.g. processing, backups), I wouldn't have a hole in my wallet. Their compute was also <a href="https://www.oracle.com/cloud/pricing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">far cheaper</a> than other clouds, while still being a reliable major provider.</p>
<p>Their object storage service was the initial place for storing raw pages and derived data, and it was similar to S3 in function and performance. However, that quickly ran into scaling issues due to frequency of large-sized writes, which was expected as services like S3 have quite low rate limits — there are <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/optimizing-performance.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hard limits</a>, but also dynamic per-account/bucket quotas and high rates of 500s during periods of internal auto scaling. Since it's a managed shared service, I couldn't manually scale or adjust those.</p>
<p>For a while afterwards, I stored blobs in PostgreSQL alongside regular row data as it was manually scalable and I had it set up already. Typically you'd never do this as fat columns can cause chokepoints like write amplification around logging, bloating caches, and exceeding disk page sizes. However, PostgreSQL does have a mechanism called <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/storage-toast.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TOAST</a> which chunks and stores these large blobs in a separate table "out of the way", mitigating some of these issues.</p>
<p>This worked for a while, but eventually also hit limits. PostgreSQL was already struggling to keep up with merely inserting metadata rows at the high processing rate of the pipeline, and the additional workload of writing large blobs at those rates tipped it over the edge — I was seeing crawls that were taking minutes to ingest, and frequent vacuuming to reduce bloat that caused complete database stalls. There were a series of attempts to stretch PostgreSQL to avoid migrating:</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoiding any indices, transactions, FKs/constraints, joins, sequences, complex queries, wide columns, or fat tables.</li>
<li>Moving all upserts to the Rust coordinator RPC service that pooled connections and queued and <a href="https://www.tigerdata.com/blog/boosting-postgres-insert-performance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">batched</a> them.</li>
<li>Moving to bare metal machines with low latency NVMe SSDs and <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/atomiccommit.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">atomic writes</a>.</li>
<li>Using <a href="https://www.citusdata.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Citus</a>, which keeps the design constraints of PostgreSQL but splits into horizontal shards to scale out writes and spread the overhead.</li>
</ul>
<p>But fundamentally, this workload was not suited for the way PostgreSQL is designed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Updates create new tuples rather than updating in place, causing bloat and necessitating vacuuming that compete for I/O, but is needed for non-blocking concurrency with ACID guarantees via <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/mvcc.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MVCC</a>.</li>
<li>Every upsert is a tree lookup to a likely random page (given no predictability to crawled URLs), hitting many random pages (causing cache thrashing), and rewriting an entire page for only one entry (write amplification).</li>
<li>Every upsert also requires checking constraints and modifying separate index trees (e.g. primary keys, uniqueness).</li>
<li>These changes are double-written due to the WAL, which is at the larger page (not record) level to provide <a href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Full_page_writes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">torn write protection</a>, increasing write amplification.</li>
<li>Connections are resource-heavy processes, have lots of state tracking, and execute sequentially, not optimized for thousands of few-row writers.</li>
<li>SQL queries are very general and powerful, so things like the wire protocol, query planning, and transaction isolation add a lot of overhead for simple INSERTs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Using Citus did not help much to mitigate these overheads as they caused order of magnitude slower writes compared to raw disk I/O. It also added a coordinator, distributed query planner, and intra-cluster connections that I did not control or understand well. PostgreSQL does a lot of work for relational and ACID functionality, but what I needed was a barebones KV store with fast write performance. So I turned to <a href="https://rocksdb.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RocksDB</a> for both records/metadata and blobs.</p>
<p>RocksDB directly resolves many of the aforementioned limitations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Writes are sequentially written to the WAL (of records, not pages), and kept sorted in <a href="https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki/Memtable" target="_blank" rel="noopener">memory</a>. Only much later are they sequentially written to disk as SSTs in the background. This avoids much random I/O and write amplification.</li>
<li>Fast simple path to inserts, directly going into MemTables, skipping much of the RDBMS machinery.</li>
<li>Direct <a href="https://docs.rs/rocksdb/latest/rocksdb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">embeddable library</a> function calls rather than wire protocols and connections. I can choose a more efficient, simpler, multiplexing protocol like HTTP/2, that scales to thousands of inserters.</li>
<li>It still has features like immediately visible writes, atomic batch updates, and <a href="https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki/Iterator#consistent-view" target="_blank" rel="noopener">snapshot consistency</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Keen to avoid the previous experience and migration due to slow writes, I configured RocksDB from the beginning to optimize for writes and make full use of the NVMe SSDs.</p>

<p>I tuned it for point lookups (the dominant access pattern): bloom filters, hash indices, partitioned indices, and large block caches. For writes, large write buffers and thread pools were used to saturate disk I/O.</p>
<p>The most interesting feature of RocksDB was <a href="https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki/BlobDB" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BlobDB</a>. Large values may have an outsized impact on <a href="https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki/Compaction" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compaction</a> performance due to exacerbating write amplification. BlobDB mitigates this by storing large blobs in separate files outside the normal SSTs, leaving only small pointers there. This was highly relevant due to the large blobs I had, and made it possible to use RocksDB for both metadata/records and blobs.</p>
<p>Eventually I ran into the disk I/O limits, so I decided to scale out via sharding. A typical go-to is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistent_hashing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">consistent hashing</a>, which allows shards and nodes to expand and contract for future growth or node loss. However, it's not straightforward to implement and therefore harder to guarantee correctness via simplicity, especially around inserts and rebalance operations. Instead, I opted for a fixed set of 64 RocksDB shards, which simplified operations and client routing, while providing enough distribution capacity for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>Reads and writes get routed by the <a href="https://xxhash.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">xxHash</a> of keys. Since the set of nodes almost never changes, the shard mapping was simply a static file distributed with code, requiring no metadata or discovery service. After this sharding, the coordinator service quickly became the bottleneck, as the I/O traffic and request volume of 64 shards went through one machine, so it was later dropped and clients directly read from and wrote to RocksDB shard nodes.</p>
<p>For representing rows, I used Serde-defined types with custom compact keys to reduce de/serialization time and storage. I used <a href="https://msgpack.org/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MessagePack</a> instead of an <a href="https://github.com/djkoloski/rust_serialization_benchmark" target="_blank" rel="noopener">even faster, more compact</a> format as those are typically tied to Rust and are sensitive to field ordering, and I opted for some extra insurance against both.</p>

<p>At its peak, this system could ingest 200K writes per second across thousands of clients (crawlers, parsers, vectorizers). Each web page not only consisted of raw source HTML, but also normalized data, contextualized chunks, hundreds of high dimensional embeddings, and lots of metadata.</p>
<h2 id="service-mesh">Service mesh</h2>
<p>As the system expanded in complexity, I needed a way to discover service instances rather than hard code IPs, and communicate securely across the Internet (as I began to leverage cheaper resources elsewhere).</p>
<p>I used mTLS as a universal way to provide encryption + authentication, simpler than handling the myriad of protocols and auth methods for each service in its own way. A custom root CA was generated, and then a certificate and key was generated for each node at the OS level.</p>
<p>HTTP/2 was adopted as the protocol, and MessagePack the serialization mechanism: binary, self-describing, and supported timestamps and maps. This scaffolding allowed easily setting up and using new services via a tuned universal internal client SDK. HTTP/2 was a good protocol as I had many long fat pipes over the public Internet across nodes, not as low latency or reliable as private datacenter networks. It provided multiplexing and simple request and retry semantics, a benefit over many other protocols (e.g. PostgreSQL). mTLS + HTTP/2-based RPC made secure private service calls simple no matter where my infra resided.</p>
<p>An internal DNS service was also implemented: a control plane to see and edit internal DNS entries, and a <a href="https://coredns.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CoreDNS</a> daemon on all nodes to serve DNS requests, intercepting requests to internal DNS names and proxying the rest. I initially tried to simply use public DNS names for internal infra, but this was too unreliable, with many internal requests failing simply due to transient DNS resolution timeouts or failures.</p>
<p>I did also try ZeroTier and Tailscale, providing a single package for encrypted and authenticated communications, DNS, routing, and discovery. But they often had issues at scale (delays and transient errors joining, propagating, and discovering changes), and traffic limitations and overhead — at the time, they could not easily saturate 10 Gbps connections and consumed a lot of CPU usage. They were also harder to use within Docker containers due to touching lower networking stack layers. In the end, HTTP + mTLS was much more straightforward, required no special networking, and saturated connections with almost no overhead. It was also safer, like <a href="https://www.beyondcorp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zero Trust</a>, as services could be publicly exposed and not rely on security via routing, firewalls or secrets, which are easy to misconfigure or leak.</p>
<p>systemd services were used for setting up definitions (e.g. env vars, limits), accounting (via cgroups), and management tools and logs (via journald). It seemed like a good trade off:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simple yet comprehensive without custom scripts and workflows. Easy to debug on any out-of-the-box Linux machine.</li>
<li>Lightweight framework: declarative, structured, but no building images, repos, deployment opinions, etc.</li>
<li>No performance overhead and multiple layers of abstraction.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="gpu-buildout">GPU buildout</h2>
<p>My initial prototype used OpenAI embeddings, available via API. That became economically infeasible as I scaled, so I set out to run inference myself.</p>
<p>In search of the most cost effective scalable solution, I discovered <a href="https://www.runpod.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Runpod</a>, who offer high performance-per-dollar GPUs like the RTX 4090 at far cheaper per-hour rates than AWS and Lambda. These were operated from tier 3 DCs with stable fast networking and lots of reliable compute capacity.</p>
<p>A key concern was GPU efficiency: they are expensive so I wanted to make sure they're fully utilized. Essentially, this meant that the operations before and after inference should not block the GPU:</p>
<ul>
<li>Polling for pending jobs and fetching input data</li>
<li>Parsing and tokenizing input data</li>
<li>Processing and storing output embeddings</li>
</ul>
<p>These Runpod workers were far from my main infra, so the long fat pipe was a concern. The latency meant that the GPU could finish inference before inputs and outputs could be transferred. Therefore, I implemented a Rust pipeline wrapping the Python core inference that could:</p>
<ul>
<li>operate each stage asynchronously without blocking upstream steps</li>
<li>signal backpressure to pause upstream stages and not overwhelm system resources</li>
</ul>
<p>These traits gave the benefit of dynamic tuning — I did not have to manually tune or limit based on specific hardware and data; the pipeline would fill up as quickly as any subsystem could handle, then signal backpressure to prevent overflowing, leading to peak efficiency automatically, as well as handling any bursts and slowdowns (e.g. network outages). Each stage utilized different hardware (CPU, networking, RAM, GPU) so a simple serial execution would needlessly block and idle resources.</p>

<p>A minor feature was the use of IPC over named pipes to talk to the Python process, rather than repeated subprocess spawns, reading/writing files, or spinning up a local HTTP/RPC server. Nowadays, I'd probably use <a href="https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PyO3</a> or <a href="https://github.com/huggingface/candle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">candle-rs</a>.</p>
<p>Using job queues also meant autorecovery when workers died. This made it trivial to use cheaper preemptible workers and scale up and down at any time. The result was a service that generated 100K embeddings per second across 250 GPUs at peak, with 90% average GPU utilization.</p>
<h2 id="sharded-hnsw">Sharded HNSW</h2>
<p>I used <a href="https://github.com/nmslib/hnswlib" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HNSW</a> as the algorithm and index for low latency vector searches. It's an in-memory optimized graph data structure that allows for sublinear <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nearest_neighbor_search" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ANN</a> querying. I go into detail about ANN, graph algorithms, and HNSW <a href="https://blog.wilsonl.in/graph-vector-search/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in this post</a>.</p>
<p>As the HNSW index began to outgrow the available RAM on a single machine, I investigated ways to scale it. Existing vector databases were overly complex to operationalize and slow at ingesting and querying due to serving broader needs. They also required subtle tuning and knowledge of various indexing methods and trade offs that would affect recall.</p>
<p>I decided to stick with tried-and-true HNSW and uniformly shard it into 64 nodes, enough to scale for the foreseeable future. This retained the same low latency and high accuracy, since each shard is queried in parallel and remains a high-quality (not quantized or downgraded) full HNSW index, while now scalable to far larger combined index sizes.</p>
<p>However, the downside to this is that it requires lots of expensive RAM, and maintains the HNSW limitations of lack of updatability. Whenever I needed to update the index, it involved loading giant HNSW indices into the RAM of builder nodes, inserting the new embeddings, and performing a full dump. I decided to dive deep into this and built a vector database that uses cheaper disk and can perform live graph updates, downsizing the entire cluster to one machine with only 128 GB RAM and requiring no complex update pipelines, while still retaining high recall over 3 billion embeddings. It's an open source vector DB called <strong>CoreNN</strong>, which I go into detail in <a href="https://blog.wilsonl.in/corenn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this blog post</a>.</p>
<h2 id="optimizing-latency">Optimizing latency</h2>
<p>The user experience of a search engine is interesting, as there is an emphasis on latency specifically and not flashiness or sophisticated design. Many search engines feel different from the typical modern app: they lack loading indicators and animations, have plain designs and not much interactivity, and stream in like a "traditional" web page. As such, instant results is a baseline user expectation for search engines. To optimize for responsiveness, I sought to reduce latency at all layers of the stack.</p>
<p>I used <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-au/application-services/products/argo-smart-routing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cloudflare Argo</a> so that users hit closer edge PoP servers, which then routes via internal Cloudflare <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_area_network" target="_blank" rel="noopener">private networks</a> rather than the Internet, meaning fewer hops, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_loss" target="_blank" rel="noopener">drops</a>, and congestion. Cloudflare also uses HTTP/3 at these edge PoPs, which reduces handshake overhead and head-of-line blocking. Setting up read replicas across the globe was too expensive.</p>
<p>Rather than making many client-server round-trip API requests, the app server fetches all necessary data and prepares the entire response page on the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/SSR" target="_blank" rel="noopener">server side</a>, minified and compressed. An endpoint handler defines the rendered tree with Promises (that start executing immediately in background) at subtrees that need fetched data, and a custom SSR framework eagerly streams out HTML as it traverses, awaiting each Promise only when reached to not block ready content. This is done to reduce <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_to_first_byte" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TTFB</a> and make the page feel responsive by streaming in rather than appear all at once after a long delay.</p>

    })(),
  ),
);
</code></pre>
<p>JSX would probably be more elegant, but would've required some work to customize transpilation and the runtime (to handle Promises).</p>
<p>In terms of throughput of internal services, the RocksDB and HNSW shards already provided ample read capacity. The only scaling that was done for queries was to introduce a vectorizer service for generating embeddings for queries. This ran on CPU as the limited batching plus latency of distant GPUs negated any gains via fast floating point operations.</p>
<h2 id="knowledge-graph">Knowledge graph</h2>
<p>I wanted to reproduce the <a href="https://support.google.com/knowledgepanel/answer/9163198?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">knowledge panel</a> that shows on the right side of search results. Wikipedia and Wikidata seemed like good sources to populate this panel, but their APIs are slow and rate limited. Fortunately, they offer <a href="https://dumps.wikimedia.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full exports</a> of all their data on a regular cadence, which I used to build local optimized indices and query services.</p>
<p>Wikipedia offers nice structured data for articles (e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/summary/Australia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Australia</a>) that contains a relevant image, an extract, and a reference to a Wikidata <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Help:Items" target="_blank" rel="noopener">item</a>. These have associated properties that describe their relationships to other entities, useful for populating the "quick facts" (e.g. date of birth) in a knowledge panel. Combined, they form a good initial system for knowledge panels:</p>
<ul>
<li>Articles form the base set of knowledge panels.</li>
<li>The title + summary are combined to generate embeddings for retrieving the relevant knowledge panel to show for a query.</li>
<li>The image, title, description, and summary are shown in the top half of the panel.</li>
<li>If there's a linked Wikidata item, that entity is looked up in the knowledge base and specific associated properties are retrieved.</li>
</ul>
<p>Not all Wikipedia articles should be shown as knowledge panels (e.g. lists), and embedding retrieval may not give the most relevant results (e.g. showing a specific adjacent article rather than the base/broader topic). Similarly, not all Wikidata properties are worth showing. There are also lots of other data sources available to incorporate. So there are still lots of improvements to be had, but it worked well as a good starting point.</p>
<h2 id="serp">SERP</h2>
<p>The resulting search engine results page (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_results_page" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SERP</a>) looks like this:</p>
<a href="https://blog.wilsonl.in/search-engine/serp-rocksdb.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://blog.wilsonl.in/search-engine/serp-rocksdb.png" alt="Screenshot of final SERP without AI features."></a>
<p>I aimed for a clean minimal look to go for the "signal over noise" aesthetic. The specific statement snippets show up under "fact" pages like docs and wikis, to give quick references and answers for queries. Another example:</p>
<a href="https://blog.wilsonl.in/search-engine/serp-protein-in-chicken.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://blog.wilsonl.in/search-engine/serp-protein-in-chicken.png" alt="Screenshot of SERP with statement snippets."></a>
<p>What's great is the comparable lack of SEO spam. For example, I queried "best programming blogs" on a well known search engine and compared it to mine:</p>
<figure>

  <figcaption>Results from my search engine.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Here's an example of finding some interesting writings and insights around a query:</p>

<p>As mentioned in the beginning, the search engine is able to understand very complex queries, including entire paragraphs about ideas. For example, I entered an entire paragraph from an LLM discussion, and found some interesting high quality essays revolving around that and adjacent topics:</p>
<a href="https://blog.wilsonl.in/search-engine/serp-paragraph.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://blog.wilsonl.in/search-engine/serp-paragraph.png" alt="Screenshot of SERP for a paragraph about self-worth and high achievers."></a>
<p>The above UI is from the modernized <a href="#live-demo">live demo</a>.</p>
<h3 id="ai-assistant">AI assistant</h3>
<p>As LLMs were taking off around the time (which has only grown since), I decided to see if I could add some subtle useful AI features. I thought they could be helpful in three ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide a very quick concise answer to a straightforward query that doesn't need research.</li>
<li>Have conversations with an AI assistant.</li>
<li>Summarize results relative to the query.</li>
</ul>
<p>It resulted in helpful augmentation without ruining the search experience:</p>
<figure>

  <figcaption>AI features give quick answers, related questions, and more tailored summaries, while still leaving main experience as is.</figcaption>

  <figcaption>I found the statement snippets to be helpful for official references, while AI provides a quick direct answer.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I found it especially useful for programming queries, where I often knew what was right and just needed a quick refresher. The AI quick answer was very concise and to the point, which aligned with my needs.</p>

<p>It's able to remain clear even for more complex queries, while high quality results remain ranked at the top if you want to dive deeper:</p>
<a href="https://blog.wilsonl.in/search-engine/serp-parted.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://blog.wilsonl.in/search-engine/serp-parted.png"></a>
<h3 id="state-tracking">State tracking</h3>
<p>Tracking clicks is useful for improving search quality and finding "dead zones", spam results, and poor ranking. To prevent abuse, all results go through an <code>/act</code> URL with an AES-256-GCM encrypted data string containing important result data, which tracks important metrics and then redirects to the result URL.</p>
<p>Since the app is entirely SSR, it used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post/Redirect/Get" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PRG</a> to handle client actions. Often, there's a need to show or alter some UX upon redirecting after the action to indicate to the user the result. This means some state needed to be persisted across the POST to the GET, which I decided to use one-off cookies to relay the state, skipping the need for any server-side state. This also allowed the app to remain JS-free.</p>
<h2 id="search-quality">Search quality</h2>
<p>Two big things I learnt about search engine quality:</p>
<ol>
<li>Quantity is quality. If a search engine can't find something, it's not useful.</li>
<li>Crawling and filtering is the most difficult and most important aspect.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first point was obvious in retrospect. It's a limitation of my search engine; due to time and resource constraints, I was unable to crawl the whole web. Since the web and space of information is so large, this means large uneven gaps in search results.</p>
<p>The second point was tricky. The Internet is such a large search space, that figuring out direction and filtering is basically a necessity, to avoid picking up entire swathes of junk, spiralling in ever more deserted corners of the web, or going too deep in one area and leaving gaps in others. Yet this is a hard problem to solve, without a clear immediate starting point or obvious direction/implementation. It has to operate on large amounts of unstructured data, which often means complex <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">language</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_theory#Link_analysis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">network</a> analysis, at the scale of the web. Determining authenticity, trust, originality, accuracy, and quality automatically is not trivial.</p>
<p>I have ideas about how to tackle this, and if I started over I would put more emphasis on researching and developing this aspect first. Infamously, search engines use <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en_us/search/howsearchworks/how-search-works/ranking-results/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">thousands of signals</a> on ranking and filtering pages, but I believe newer transformer-based approaches towards content evaluation and link analysis should be simpler, cost effective, and more accurate. I also believe agentic search will play a big role in the near future, being able to comprehend, filter, rank, and beam search instead of simple retrieval.</p>
<p>At query time, some basic quality filters are applied:</p>
<ul>
<li>Non-English.</li>
<li>Pages with empty titles or contents.</li>
<li>Matches <a href="https://github.com/hagezi/dns-blocklists" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blocklists</a>.</li>
<li>Duplicates, measured using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jaccard similarity</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigram" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trigrams</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="live-demo">Live demo</h2>
<a href="https://blog.wilsonl.in/search-engine/serp-demo.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://blog.wilsonl.in/search-engine/serp-demo.png" alt="Screenshot of demo SERP."></a>
<p>I have re-deployed the search engine as a usable demo with a more modern minimalist app that focuses on search results only.</p>
<p>I've added LLM-based reranking and filtering, which those two final sliders represent. I'm experimenting to see if using the latest general intelligence LLMs can help achieve better reranking and filtering without the need for a custom model and training data. <a href="https://groq.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Groq</a> is the inference backend to ensure low latency responses — general intelligence at subsecond latency seems like a powerful underrated tool.</p>
<p>Because this is a demo environment, it's not as low latency as the regular production setup. As mentioned in <a href="#search-quality">search quality</a>, there will be noticeable gaps in search result quality for various queries due to incomplete index and quality filtering. The index cutoff is around August 2023.</p>
<p>Play around with the live demo at <a href="https://search.wilsonl.in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">search.wilsonl.in</a>.</p>
<h2 id="costs">Costs</h2>
<p>I sought out ways to leverage lesser-known order-of-magnitude cost efficiencies as it was a side project:</p>

<p>Not only did these low-hanging cost savings save a lot of money when added up, they lowered the barrier that made the project feasible at all, and able to scale on constrained and commodity resources. I was surprised at the lower cost than I expected going in, given the size of the infra and data, involving hundreds of GPUs and terabytes of data.</p>
<p>However, I did have to stop indexing as it was a solo project paid out of pocket. I estimate that this search engine project could be sustained by around 10K $5/month subscriptions, which is not very high for adding another indigenous search index to the limited handful that currently exist in the world, especially one focused on quality and not ads. I think optimizing towards building an index of quality over quantity is also useful for <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.21783#page=5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">training LLMs</a>.</p>
<p>There was one surprise when I revisited costs: OpenAI charges an unusually low <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/pricing#embeddings" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$0.0001 / 1M tokens</a> for batch inference on their latest embedding model. Even conservatively assuming I had 1 billion crawled pages, each with 1K tokens (abnormally long), it would only cost <strong>$100</strong> to generate embeddings for all of them. By comparison, running my own inference, even with cheap Runpod spot GPUs, would cost on the order of 100× more expensive, to say nothing of <a href="https://cohere.com/pricing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other</a> <a href="https://jina.ai/embeddings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">APIs</a>. This wasn't available at the time, so I couldn't take advantage of this, but I'm keeping it in mind for future projects.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion-and-what's-next">Conclusion and what's next</h2>
<p>I find that one of the biggest values of neural embeddings is the ability to find great content, insights, and references. These often reside in essays and documentations, and are article-like content. Queries that are just "bookmarks" (e.g. <code>python download windows</code>) or exact phrase matching require a very broad index (including very obscure pages) but also don't leverage intelligence or comprehension; bookmarks could be indexed only by <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> keywords and URL substrings. Given this, one direction I want to explore is a more focused index that selects specifically for high quality interesting content across the long tail of the web. In general, exploring how to have sub-engines for more accurate, tailored, relevant, and efficient results for different domains and intents is worthwhile.</p>
<p>Embeddings do seem to be far more powerful than traditional search, and seeing the superior quality results (when the index has enough data) made me excited about the future of search and retrieval. With typical search engines, the more specific you get, the worse the results. Being able to narrow down and zoom in via a very specific query to find exactly what you want (quality, vibe, perspective, thought, idea, etc.) via obscure insights and relationships is very powerful and underexplored.</p>
<p>Despite the rise of LLMs, I think that search will always play a role: LLMs can't and shouldn't memorize all knowledge, using parameters that could be used for more intelligence and capability. Instead, LLMs can offload that to representations of knowledge via these efficient dense indices, which would also mean less hallucinations and more up-to-date information. Perhaps we will have community-maintained open-source local search indices alongside our open-source local models.</p>
<p>Besides <a href="#search-quality">systematic data quality assurance</a>, there are other low hanging optimizations to explore:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is it possible to leverage existing crawling infrastructure like <a href="https://commoncrawl.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Common Crawl</a>?</li>
<li>Could <a href="https://huggingface.co/blog/static-embeddings" target="_blank" rel="noopener">static embeddings</a>, which are 400x faster to infer, be used?</li>
<li>Embedding models: <a href="https://jina.ai/news/late-chunking-in-long-context-embedding-models/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">late chunking</a>, quantization, long context (to avoid chunking), incorporating new knowledge without re-generating all embeddings, and leveraging <a href="https://onnx.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ONNX</a>.</li>
<li>Leveraging data APIs, dumps, and agreements rather than crawling.</li>
<li>Rewriting the crawler and parser in Rust for order of magnitude speedups.</li>
</ul>
<p>I plan on posting further write-ups on this project, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>A deeper analysis of the crawled index, with large scale visual and textual content evaluations and <a href="https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">semantic maps</a>.</li>
<li>Building a dataset from the crawled data, to test recall of the search engine, and compare it to how much knowledge LLMs memorize.</li>
<li>An <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/io_uring.7.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">io_uring</a> based KV store written from scratch that did not make it to production.</li>
<li>An investigation into how agentic search, <a href="https://groq.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ultrafast</a> <a href="https://www.cerebras.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LLM</a> reranking and filtering, and generative UX could alter the search experience.</li>

<p>The National Drought Group met today (Monday 11 August) with the current water shortfall situation in England now defined as a “nationally significant incident.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Five areas are officially in drought, with six more experiencing prolonged dry weather following the driest six months to July since 1976.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite the unsettled weather last month, many river flows and reservoir levels in England continued to recede compared to June.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rainstorms and showers helped mask the fact that July was still the fifth warmest on record.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>August has started to see a return of drier conditions and the fourth heatwave of the summer - putting more pressure on already struggling public water supplies and navigational waterways.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The National Drought Group - which includes the Met Office, government, regulators, water companies, the National Farmers’ Union, Canal &amp; River Trust, anglers, and conservation experts – used the meeting to highlight the water-saving measures each sector is taking.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>They also praised the public for reducing their own daily usage, with Yorkshire Water reporting a 10% reduction in domestic demand following their hosepipe ban. This equates to saving up to 80 million litres per day – equivalent to 32 Olympic-sized swimming pools.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The less water that is used, the less needs to be abstracted from local rivers – therefore protecting the health of our waterways and wildlife.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h4 id="the-environment-agencys-director-of-water-and-ndg-chair-helen-wakeham-said">The Environment Agency’s Director of Water and NDG chair, Helen Wakeham said:</h4>
<blockquote>

  <p>The current situation is nationally significant, and we are calling on everyone to play their part and help reduce the pressure on our water environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Water companies must continue to quickly fix leaks and lead the way in saving water. We know the challenges farmers are facing and will continue to work with them, other land users, and businesses to ensure everyone acts sustainably.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

  <p>We are grateful to the public for following the restrictions, where in place, to conserve water in these dry conditions. Simple, everyday choices – such as turning off a tap or deleting old emails – also really helps the collective effort to reduce demand and help preserve the health of our rivers and wildlife.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The recent rainfall has been welcomed by growers, although the impacts from the dry weather remain as farmers continue their harvest.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The National Farmers Union noted how water shortages have impacted the growing season this year. &nbsp;</p>

<h4 id="nfu-vice-president-rachel-hallos-said">NFU Vice-President, Rachel Hallos said:</h4>
<blockquote>

  <p>British farmers and growers continue to face extremely dry conditions, with harvest underway and crop yields proving mixed across the country. Some farms are reporting a significant drop in yields, which is financially devasting for the farm business and could have impacts for the UK’s overall harvest. &nbsp;</p>

  <p>Farming is a long-term industry and there is growing concern about the months ahead. Minimal grass growth means many livestock farmers are already tapping into winter feed stocks, raising the risk of higher production costs later in the year.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Access to clean, reliable water is essential for food production. What’s worked well during this drought has been early, coordinated communication with stakeholders around licence restrictions and drought permits and orders and it’s crucial this continues.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>To avoid the swing between extreme drought and flooding and to secure water supplies for food production, we urgently need investment in water infrastructure and a more effective planning system.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Periods of dry weather and low rivers reduce oxygen levels in water that can lead to fish kills and more algal blooms. Lower river flows also prevent wildlife from moving up or downstream.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Drying out wetlands can be devastating for species that depend on those habits while England has seen an increase in wildfires, devastating vulnerable areas of heathland and moorland.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Met Office updated the group on the future weather outlook, noting drier weather has returned.</p>

<h4 id="chief-meteorologist-at-the-met-office-dr-will-lang-said">Chief Meteorologist at the Met Office, Dr Will Lang said:</h4>
<blockquote>

  <p>This week is starting off warmer than of late across England and Wales with temperatures getting towards the mid-30s Celsius for some in the south.</p>

  <p>While conditions remain mostly&nbsp;settled across the south, the picture is more unsettled further northwest, with rain or showers at times.</p>

  <p>As we move into the second half of August, there are indications of high pressure building and therefore largely settled conditions overall. Although dry weather is more likely, rain, showers or thunderstorms cannot be ruled out.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The heat and climate change also impact human health, through issues such as heatstroke, dehydration, and respiratory problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Steve Reed, Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, and Philip Duffy, Chief Executive of the Environment Agency, have also briefed Pat McFadden, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, about the situation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h4 id="speaking-after-attending-the-meeting-water-minister-emma-hardy-said">Speaking after attending the meeting, Water Minister Emma Hardy said:</h4>
<blockquote>

  <p>Working with the National Drought Group, the Government is urgently stepping up its response to ensure we are successfully managing the impacts of ongoing dry weather. &nbsp;</p>

  <p>Water companies must now take action to follow their drought plans - I will hold them to account if they delay.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

  <p>We face a growing water shortage in the next decade. That’s why we are pushing ahead with root and branch reform under our Plan for Change, which includes £104 billion of private investment to build nine reservoirs and new pipes to cut leaks.</p>
</blockquote>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Over 500,000 customers with Anglian Water have had leaks identified via their smart meters. This helped the firm reduce leaks by a total of 187 million litres a day, equivalent to 75 Olympic-sized swimming pools.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Anglian Water’s satellite technology has also helped prioritise leak detection, saving over 320,000 litres of water a day in rural areas, enough to supply 1,000 homes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="drought-and-the-environment-agency">DROUGHT AND THE ENVIRONMENT AGENCY</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The Environment Agency continues to work with Government, including Defra and the Cabinet Office, on the drought response.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Environment Agency has escalated its operational response and diverted resources to ensure a rapid and nationwide response.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is conducting more compliance checks on businesses who abstract water to ensure regulations are met.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is actively engaging with water companies on requests for drought permits and drought orders and ensuring they follow their drought plans.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is increased monitoring of river and groundwater level and more modelling of rainfall patterns to inform decisions, including additional restrictions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Environment Agency  is working closely with farmers in East Anglia, requesting voluntary reductions on surface water abstraction. This will help conserve and extend the total period when water is available for abstraction, protect the environment and delay the need for any formal restrictions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The regulator has sped up the process of alerting abstractors about restrictions.&nbsp; <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/manage-your-water-abstraction-or-impoundment-licences-online">Manage your water abstraction licence online - GOV.UK</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The EA is managing potential navigation issues caused by low flows on the Rivers Thames, Lark and Great Ouse.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="how-to-save-water-at-home">HOW TO SAVE WATER AT HOME</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Install a rain butt to collect rainwater to use in the garden.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fix a leaking toilet – leaky loos can waste 200-400 litres a day.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use water from the kitchen to water your plants.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

		<p>It is an uncomfortable job for anyone trying to draw the line between “harmful content and protecting freedom of speech. It’s a balance”, Aaron says. In this <a href="https://about.facebook.com/regulations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official Facebook video</a>, Aaron identifies himself as the manager of “the team that writes the rules for Facebook”, determining “what is acceptable and what is not.” Thus, he and his team effectively decide what content the platform’s 2.9 billion active users see and what they don’t see.</p>
<p>Aaron is being interviewed in a bright warehouse-turned-studio. He is wearing a purple sweater and blue jeans. He comes across as a very likable, smiley person. It is not an easy job, of course, but someone has to make those calls. “Transparency is incredibly important in the work that I do,” he says.</p>
<p>Aaron is CIA. Or at least he was until July 2019, when he left his job as a senior analytic manager at the agency to become senior product policy manager for misinformation at Meta, the company that owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. In his 15-year career, Aaron Berman rose to become a highly influential part of the CIA. For years, he prepared and edited the president of the United States’ daily brief, “wr[iting] and overs[eeing] intelligence analysis to enable the President and senior U.S. officials to make decisions on the most critical national security issues,” especially on “the impact of influence operations on social movements, security, and democracy,” his LinkedIn <a title="" href="https://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/FireShot-Capture-017-29-Aaron-Berman-LinkedIn-www.linkedin.com_.png">profile</a> reads. None of this is mentioned in the Facebook video.</p>
<p><img title="Aaron Berman | MR Online" decoding="async" src="https://mronline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Untitled-design-10_edited-copy-1024x798.jpg" alt="Aaron Berman" width="810" height="631" srcset="https://mronline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Untitled-design-10_edited-copy-1024x798.jpg 1024w, https://mronline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Untitled-design-10_edited-copy-350x273.jpg 350w, https://mronline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Untitled-design-10_edited-copy-768x598.jpg 768w, https://mronline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Untitled-design-10_edited-copy-810x631.jpg 810w, https://mronline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Untitled-design-10_edited-copy-1140x888.jpg 1140w, https://mronline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Untitled-design-10_edited-copy.jpg 1181w" sizes="(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px"></p>
<p>Berman’s case is far from unique, however. Studying Meta’s reports, as well as employment websites and databases, <i>MintPress</i> has found that Facebook has recruited dozens of individuals from the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), as well as many more from other agencies like the FBI and Department of Defense (DoD). These hires are primarily in highly politically sensitive sectors such as trust, security and content moderation, to the point where some might feel it becomes difficult to see where the U.S. national security state ends and Facebook begins.</p>
<p>In previous investigations, this author has detailed how <a href="https://www.mintpressnews.com/nato-tiktok-pipeline-why-tiktok-employing-national-security-agents/280336/">TikTok is flooded</a> with NATO officials, how <a href="https://www.mintpressnews.com/twitter-hiring-alarming-number-spooks-secret-agents/281114/">former FBI agents</a> abound at Twitter, and how Reddit is led by a <a href="https://www.mintpressnews.com/jessica-ashooh-reddit-national-security-state-plant/277639/">former war planner</a> for the NATO think tank, the Atlantic Council. But the sheer scale of infiltration of Facebook blows these away. Facebook, in short, is utterly swarming with spooks.</p>
<h2>TRUST ME, BRO</h2>
<p>In a political sense, trust, safety and misinformation are the most sensitive parts of Meta’s operation. It is here where decisions about what content is allowed, what will be promoted and who or what will be suppressed are made. These decisions affect what news and information billions of people across the world see every day. Therefore, those in charge of the algorithms hold far more power and influence over the public sphere than even editors at the largest news outlets.</p>
<p>There are a number of other ex-CIA agents working in these fields. Deborah Berman, for example, <a title="" href="https://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/FireShot-Capture-018-29-Deborah-Berman.-LinkedIn-www.linkedin.com_.png">spent</a> 10 years as a data and intelligence analyst at the CIA before recently being brought on as a trust and safety project manager for Meta. Little is known about what she did at the agency, but her pre-agency <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/358031653_5_THE_SYRIAN_NUCLEAR_PUZZLE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">publications</a> indicate she was a specialist on Syria.</p>

In 2020, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sherikama/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sherif Kamal</a> left his job as a program manager at the Pentagon to take up the post of Meta trust and safety program manager.</p>
<p><a title="" href="https://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/FireShot-Capture-031-65-Joey-Chan-LinkedIn-www.linkedin.com_.png">Joey Chan</a> currently holds the same trust and safety post as Kamal. Until last year, Chan was a U.S. Army officer commanding a company of over 100 troops in the Asia Pacific region.</p>
<p><img title="Joey Chan | MR Online" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://mronline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Joey-Chan-1024x1024.jpg" alt="Joey Chan" width="810" height="810" srcset="https://mronline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Joey-Chan-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://mronline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Joey-Chan-350x350.jpg 350w, https://mronline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Joey-Chan-200x200.jpg 200w, https://mronline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Joey-Chan-768x768.jpg 768w, https://mronline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Joey-Chan-810x810.jpg 810w, https://mronline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Joey-Chan-1140x1140.jpg 1140w, https://mronline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Joey-Chan.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px"></p>
<p>None of this is to say that any of those named are not conscientious, that they are bad people or bad at their job. Vacher, for example, <a href="https://www.teenvogue.com/story/emily-vacher-interview-facebook-amber-alert-women-in-tech" target="_blank" rel="noopener">helped</a> design Facebook’s amber alert program, notifying people to missing children in their area. But hiring so many ex-U.S. state officials to run Facebook’s most politically sensitive operations raises troubling questions about the company’s impartiality and its proximity to government power. Meta is so full of national security state agents that at some point, it almost becomes more difficult to find individuals in trust and safety who were <i>not</i> formerly agents of the state.</p>
<p>Despite its <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/cia-recruitment-video-backlash-wokeness-b1841656.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">efforts</a> to brand itself as a progressive, “woke” organization, the Central Intelligence Agency remains deeply controversial. It has been charged with <a href="https://www.mintpressnews.com/cia-continues-cover-involvement-chiles-911-coup/220254/">overthrowing</a> or attempting to overthrow <a href="https://www.mintpressnews.com/state-department-release-official-history-of-cia-orchestrated-iranian-coup/228961/">numerous</a> foreign governments (some of them democratically elected), <a href="https://ips-dc.org/the_cias_worst-kept_secret_newly_declassified_files_confirm_united_states_collaboration_with_nazis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">helping</a> prominent Nazis escape punishment after World War Two, funnelling large quantities of <a href="https://www.mintpressnews.com/cia-afghanistan-drug-trade-opium/277780/">drugs</a> and <a href="https://ips-dc.org/the_cia_contras_gangs_and_crack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weapons</a> around the world, <a href="https://www.mintpressnews.com/spooks-establishment-journalists-circling-wagons/281217/">penetrating</a> domestic media outlets, routinely spreading false information and <a href="https://www.mintpressnews.com/cia-guantanamo-bay-torture-programs-mkultra-roots/280275/">operating</a> a global network of “black sites” where prisoners are repeatedly tortured. Therefore, critics argue that putting operatives from this organization in control of our news feeds is deeply inappropriate.</p>
<p>One of these critics is Elizabeth Murray, who, in 2010, retired from a 27-year career at the CIA and other U.S. intelligence organizations. “This is insidious,” Murray told <i>MintPress</i>, adding,</p>
<blockquote><p>I see it as part of the gradual and sinister migration of ambitious young professionals originally trained (with CIA’s virtually unlimited, U.S.-taxpayer funded pot of resources) to surveil and target ‘the bad guys’ during the so-called Global War on Terror of the post-9-11 era.</p></blockquote>
<p><i>MintPress</i> also contacted Facebook/Meta for comment but has not received a response.</p>
<h2>ARM’S LENGTH CONTROL</h2>
<p>Some may ask what the big fuss is. There is a limited pool of individuals with the necessary skills and experience in these new tech and cybersecurity fields, and many of them come from government institutions. Casinos, after all, regularly hire card sharks to protect themselves. But there is little evidence that this is a poacher-turned-gamekeeper scenario; Facebook is certainly not hiring whistleblowers. The problem is not that these individuals are incompetant. The problem is that having so many former CIA employees running the world’s most important information and news platform is only one small step removed from the agency itself deciding what you see and what we do not see online–and all with essentially no public oversight.</p>
<p>In this sense, this arrangement constitutes the best of both worlds for Washington. They can exert significant influence over global news and information flows but maintain some veneer of plausible deniability. The U.S. government does not need to directly tell Facebook what policies to enact. This is because the people in decision-making positions are inordinately those who rose through the ranks of the national security state beforehand, meaning their outlooks match those of Washington’s. And if Facebook does not play ball, quiet threats about regulation or breaking up the company’s enormous monopoly can also achieve the desired outcomes.</p>
<p>Again, this article is not claiming that any of the named individuals are nefarious actors, or even that they are anything but model employees. This is a structural problem. Put another way, if Facebook were hiring dozens of managers from Russian intelligence agencies like the FSB or GRU, everybody would recognize the inherent dangers. It should be little different when it hires individuals from the CIA, an organization responsible for some of the worst crimes of the modern era.</p>
<h2>FROM STATE INTELLIGENCE TO PRIVATE INTELLIGENCE</h2>
<p>Facebook has also hired a plethora of ex-national security state officers to run its intelligence and online security operations. Until 2013, <a href="https://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/FireShot-Capture-032-65-Scott-Stern-LinkedIn-www.linkedin.com_.png">Scott Stern</a> was a targeting officer at the CIA, rising to become chief of targeting. In this role, he helped select the targets for U.S. drone strikes across South and West Asia. Today, however, as a senior manager of risk intelligence for Meta, “misinformation” and “malicious actors” are his targets. Hopefully he is more accurate at Facebook than at the CIA, where the government’s own internal assessments <a href="https://www.amnesty.org.uk/thank-you-us-deadly-drones" target="_blank" rel="noopener">show</a> that at least 90% of Afghans killed in drone strikes were innocent civilians.</p>
<p>Other former CIA men at Facebook include <a title="" href="https://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/FireShot-Capture-034-65-Mike-Torrey-LinkedIn-www.linkedin.com_.png">Mike Torrey</a>, who left his job as a senior analyst at the agency to become Meta’s technical lead of detection, investigations and disruptions of complex information operations threats, and former CIA contractor <a title="" href="https://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/FireShot-Capture-035-65-Hagan-Barnett-LinkedIn-www.linkedin.com_.png">Hagan Barnett</a>, who is now head of harmful content operations at the Silicon Valley giant.</p>
<p><img title="Hagan Barnett | MR Online" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://mronline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Untitled-design-5-copy-1024x1024.jpg" alt="Hagan Barnett" width="810" height="810" srcset="https://mronline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Untitled-design-5-copy-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://mronline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Untitled-design-5-copy-350x350.jpg 350w, https://mronline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Untitled-design-5-copy-200x200.jpg 200w, https://mronline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Untitled-design-5-copy-768x768.jpg 768w, https://mronline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Untitled-design-5-copy-810x810.jpg 810w, https://mronline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Untitled-design-5-copy-1140x1140.jpg 1140w, https://mronline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Untitled-design-5-copy.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px"></p>
<p>Meta’s intelligence and online security team includes individuals from virtually every government agency imaginable. In 2015, Department of Defense intelligence officer <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/suzannalee/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Suzanna Morrow</a> left her post to become director of global security intelligence for Meta. The FBI is represented by threat investigations manager <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ellen-nixon-b160b771/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ellen Nixon</a> and head of cyber espionage investigations <a href="https://www.cyberwarcon.com/mike-dvilyanski" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mike Dvilyanski</a>. Facebook’s influence operations policy manager <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/olgabelogolova/details/experience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Olga Belogolova</a> had stints at the State Department and the Office of the Secretary of Defense.</p>
<p>Before Meta, <a title="" href="https://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/FireShot-Capture-039-65-Experience-David-Agranovich-LinkedIn-www.linkedin.com_.png">David Agranovich</a> and <a title="" href="https://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/FireShot-Capture-040-65-Experience-Nathaniel-Gleicher-LinkedIn-www.linkedin.com_.png">Nathaniel Gleicher</a> both worked for the National Security Council. Agranovich is director of global threat disruption at Facebook while Gleicher is head of security policy. <a title="" href="https://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/FireShot-Capture-041-65-Hayley-Chang.-LinkedIn-www.linkedin.com_.png">Hayley Chang</a>, director and associate general counsel for cybersecurity and investigations, worked formerly for both the FBI and Department of Homeland Security. And Meta’s global head of interaction operations, <a title="" href="https://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/FireShot-Capture-042-65-Experience-David-Hansell-LinkedIn-www.linkedin.com_.png">David Hansell</a>, was once an Air Force and Defense Intelligence Agency man.</p>
<p><img title="Suzanna Morrow | MR Online" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://mronline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Untitled-design-6-copy-1024x1024.jpg" alt="Suzanna Morrow" width="810" height="810" srcset="https://mronline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Untitled-design-6-copy-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://mronline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Untitled-design-6-copy-350x350.jpg 350w, https://mronline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Untitled-design-6-copy-200x200.jpg 200w, https://mronline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Untitled-design-6-copy-768x768.jpg 768w, https://mronline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Untitled-design-6-copy-810x810.jpg 810w, https://mronline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Untitled-design-6-copy-1140x1140.jpg 1140w, https://mronline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Untitled-design-6-copy.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px"></p>
<p>One of Meta’s most outwardly-facing employees is its global threat intelligence lead for influence operations, Ben Nimmo, a character <i>MintPress</i> has <a href="https://www.mintpressnews.com/nicaraguans-ignore-facebook-spooks-trick-treating-election/278870/">covered</a> before. Between 2011 and 2014, he served as NATO’s press officer, moving the next year to the Institute for Statecraft, a <a href="https://www.mintpressnews.com/new-documents-reveal-covert-uk-military-intelligence-smear-machine-meddling-in-us-politics/253658/"> U.K. government-funded</a> propaganda operation aimed at spreading misleading information about enemies of the British state. He was also a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, NATO’s semi-official think tank.</p>
<p>Perhaps then, it is not surprising that Facebook never seems to find U.S. government influence operations online–they are part of one!</p>
<h2>CYBER WAR, CYBER WARRIORS</h2>
<p>While Meta has not unmasked any nefarious U.S. government action, it regularly uncovers what it claims are foreign disinformation campaigns. According to a recent Facebook <a href="https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IO-Threat-Report-May-20-2021.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a>, the top five locations of coordinated inauthentic behavior between 2017 and 2020 on its platform are Russia, Iran, Myanmar, the United States and Ukraine. However, it was at pains to note that American operations were driven by fringe far-right elements, white supremacists and conspiracy theorists, and not the government.</p>
<p>This is despite the fact that it is now well-established that the Pentagon fields a clandestine army of at least 60,000 people whose job is to influence public opinion, the majority of them doing so from their keyboards. A <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/exclusive-inside-militarys-secret-undercover-army-1591881" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i>Newsweek</i></a> exposé from last year called it “The largest undercover force the world has ever known,” adding,</p>
<blockquote><p>The explosion of Pentagon cyber warfare, moreover, has led to thousands of spies who carry out their day-to-day work in various made-up personas, the very type of nefarious operations the United States decries when Russian and Chinese spies do the same.</p></blockquote>
<p><i>Newsweek</i> warned that this army was likely breaking both U.S. and international law by doing so, explaining that,</p>
<blockquote><p>These are the cutting-edge cyber fighters and intelligence collectors who assume false personas online, employing ‘nonattribution’ and ‘misattribution’ techniques to hide the who and the where of their online presence while they search for high-value targets and collect what is called ‘publicly accessible information’—or even engage in campaigns to influence and manipulate social media.</p></blockquote>
<p>As far back as 2011, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/mar/17/us-spy-operation-social-networks" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i>The Guardian</i></a> was reporting on this enormous cyber force, whose job it was to “secretly manipulate social media sites by using fake online personas to influence internet conversations and spread pro-American propaganda.” Yet the ex-military and ex-CIA officials Facebook employs do not seem to have found any trace of their former colleagues’ at work on the platform.</p>
<h2>DIGITALLY SWINGING ELECTIONS</h2>
<p>Since its beginnings in 2004, Facebook has grown to become a massive global empire and by far the most important news distributor the planet has ever known. The company boasts almost <a href="https://investor.fb.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2022/Meta-Reports-First-Quarter-2022-Results/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">3 billion</a> active users, meaning that nearly 2 in 5 people worldwide use the platform. A recent 12-country study <a href="https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/2022-06/Digital_News-Report_2022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggested</a> that around 30% of the entire world gets its news via their Facebook feeds. This gives whoever is in charge of curating those feeds and controlling those algorithms inestimable power. It also represents a serious national security threat for all other countries, especially those that might wish to take a path independent from the United States. That those people are in large part former spooks makes this threat all the more perilous.</p>
<p>This is far from a hypothetical quandary. In November, less than a week before the country’s election, Facebook took the decision to <a href="https://www.mintpressnews.com/meet-nicaraguans-facebook-falsely-branded-bots-censored-days-elections/278835/">delete</a> hundreds of pages and accounts belonging to individuals and groups that supported the Nicaraguan Sandinista party–a longtime U.S. target for regime change. These included many of the nation’s most influential journalists and media outlets. Considering that around <a href="https://napoleoncat.com/stats/facebook-users-in-nicaragua/2020/02/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">half of the country</a> uses the platform for news and entertainment, the decision could barely have been more intrusive, and was likely designed to try to swing the election towards the pro-U.S. candidate.</p>
<p>Facebook <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/11/october-2021-coordinated-inauthentic-behavior-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">claims</a> that those accounts were bots engaged in “inauthentic behavior.” When those individuals migrated on to Twitter, recording videos identifying who they were to show they were not bots, Twitter immediately <a href="https://www.mintpressnews.com/meet-nicaraguans-facebook-falsely-branded-bots-censored-days-elections/278835/">deleted</a> those accounts too, in what was dubbed a coordinated attempt at suppression.</p>
<p>The individual behind this attempt was the aforementioned Ben Nimmo, who co-authored an unconvincing <a href="https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/October-2021-CIB-Report-Updated-Nov-5.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a>, full of questionable assumptions and allegations. This included an insinuation that accounts following a pattern of activity whereby their Facebook usage levels peaked in the morning and afternoon and dwindled to almost nothing after midnight Nicaragua time suggested they were bots.</p>
<p>Facebook was also <a href="https://www.mintpressnews.com/private-facebook-group-organized-july-protests-cuba-plans-bigger-ones-soon/278598/">used</a> by right-wing Cubans to attempt a U.S.-backed color revolution against the ruling Communist government last year.</p>
<p>Giving any individual or group that much control over the airwaves of communication raises huge questions about national security and sovereignty–doubly so when those individuals are so intimately connected to the U.S. national security state.</p>
<p>When asked what the public’s reaction would be to the news of such an intimate connection between Facebook her former employer, Murray stated that she was unsure whether many would be bothered:</p>
<blockquote><p>I would like to think that the American public would strenuously object. However the CIA and other agencies have worked over many decades to cultivate a positive–indeed almost glamorous–image in the eyes of the vast majority of the public, mostly through TV series, Hollywood films, and favorable media coverage–so sadly my guess is that the vast majority of the public probably believes that these are the folks who should be in charge.</p></blockquote>
<p>However, she said, the news would likely land a very different way in countries that have been the target of Washington’s ire. “As you’re no doubt aware, the CIA has an atrocious public reputation in most parts of the world,” she added.</p>
<h2>SPOOKS IN EVERY DEPARTMENT</h2>
<p><i>MintPress</i> has found former representatives of the U.S. national security state in virtually every politically sensitive department at Facebook. This includes even higher levels. Between 2020 and 2021, <a title="" href="https://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/FireShot-Capture-043-65-Experience-Kris-Rose-LinkedIn-www.linkedin.com_.png">Kris Rose</a> was a member of Meta’s governance oversight board–the group responsible for the overall direction of the platform. He left his job at the Director of National Intelligence as the president’s daily brief writer to take up the role. Before that, he had spent six years at the CIA as a political and counterterrorism analyst. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/FireShot-Capture-044-65-Gina-Kim-Sumilas-LinkedIn-www.linkedin.com_.png">Gina Kim Sumilas</a>, Facebook’s director and associate general counsel for the Asia Pacific region, spent nearly twelve years in the CIA before moving into the tech private sector.</p>
<p>There is also considerable overlap with the U.S. government in the company’s front facing staff. <a title="" href="https://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/FireShot-Capture-045-65-Experience-Kadia-Koroma-LinkedIn-www.linkedin.com_.png">Kadia Koroma</a>, for instance, was plucked from her position as an FBI spokesperson in January 2020 to become media relations manager at Facebook. <a title="" href="https://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/FireShot-Capture-046-65-Experience-Jeffrey-Gelman-LinkedIn-www.linkedin.com_.png">Jeffrey Gelman</a>, policy communications manager for Facebook’s oversight board, is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and held influential roles in both the State Department and the National Security Council. And executive communications spokesman <a title="" href="https://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/FireShot-Capture-047-65-Experience-Kevin-Lewis-LinkedIn-www.linkedin.com_.png">Kevin Lewis</a> spent many years in the White House as President Obama’s spokesperson.</p>
<p>Meta’s vice president of legal strategy is <a title="" href="https://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/FireShot-Capture-048-65-Rachel-Carlson-Lieber-LinkedIn-www.linkedin.com_.png">Rachel Carlson Lieber</a>, who went straight from the CIA into Facebook. Her first role at the Silicon Valley giant was as head of the North America regulatory and strategic response, a department that continues to feature a number of former state officials. This includes head of strategic programs, <a title="" href="https://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/FireShot-Capture-049-65-Robert-Flaim-LinkedIn-www.linkedin.com_.png">Robert Flaim</a>, who spent more than twenty years as an FBI, and <a href="https://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/FireShot-Capture-050-65-Experience-Erin-C.-LinkedIn-www.linkedin.com_.png">Erin Clancy</a>, who left a 16-year career at the State Department to become a manager of strategic response policy.</p>
<p>Clancy’s official work centered around U.S. policy in the Middle East. Her own bio boasts that she worked on the U.S. sanctions regime placed on Iraq and Sudan. She also worked at the U.S. Embassy in Damascus at the time of the Arab Spring and the beginning of the Syrian Civil War. It is known that she also <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/about/lgbti-at-the-council/lgbti-in-foreign-affairs-fellowship/meet-the-lgbti-fellows/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">coordinated closely</a> with the White Helmets, a controversial aid organization that some have <a href="https://www.mintpressnews.com/spooks-establishment-journalists-circling-wagons/281217/">alleged</a> is far too close to Al-Qaeda and its affiliates. Even after her Facebook appointment, Clancy moonlighted as a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and as a fellow at the Atlantic Council, the hawkish body that serves as NATO’s brain trust.</p>
<p>Why are these national security state officials so attractive to Meta? One reason, Murray explained, is financial. “By snagging a CIA employee a company can save a considerable sum,” she said, explaining that, “The individual has likely undergone extensive professional training (at taxpayer expense) and probably has a security clearance,” something that is difficult, expensive and time-consuming to obtain in private sector work. Therefore, companies dealing with matters of state secrecy (such as defense contractors) have historically courted both current and former officers to fill their ranks, enticing them with much higher salaries than they can receive in government service.</p>
<blockquote><p>“What is new (or at least newly known to us!) is that now these professionals are being sought after by social media companies like Facebook, Google and others who are now heavily into monitoring, surveilling, and censoring content, and then sharing data about users with U.S. government entities,” Murray added.</p></blockquote>
<p>Such is the need for these individuals in these fields that private companies often hire former national security agents to do the recruiting for them. For instance, <a href="https://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/FireShot-Capture-051-65-Experience-John-L.-Papp-Jr.-LinkedIn-www.linkedin.com_.png">John Papp</a>, who spent 12 years at the CIA as a senior intelligence officer and 4 years as an imagery analyst at the Defense Intelligence Agency, went on to work as a recruiter for many of the largest <a href="https://www.mintpressnews.com/1-3-big-defense-contractors-profit-us-prisoner-suffering/279648/">defense contractors</a> in Washington. These included Booz Allen Hamilton, Raytheon, Northrop Grumman, IBM and Lockheed Martin. Today, he works as a recruiter for Meta.</p>
<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, Meta also employs former spooks for their internal security operations. The company’s vice president, chief security officer is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nick-lovrien-cpp-a5a98392/details/experience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nick Lovrien</a>, a former counterterrorism operations officer at the CIA, while its head of insider protection is ex-CIA operational psychologist and “<a href="https://thegooddrnik.com/about-dr-nik/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">undercover officer</a>” <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/drnikalford/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nicole Alford</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Meta’s director of global security governance–the individual <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/zuckerberg-panic-chute-escape-facebook" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reportedly</a> responsible for the personal safety of Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg–is <a title="" href="https://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/FireShot-Capture-055-65-Jill-Leavens-Jones-LinkedIn-www.linkedin.com_.png">Jill Leavens Jones</a>. Jones left her job as a U.S. Secret Service special agent to take the appointment.

<h2>A LONG PATTERN OF INFILTRATION</h2>
<p>45 years ago, legendary journalist Carl Bernstein released an <a href="https://www.mintpressnews.com/spooks-establishment-journalists-circling-wagons/281217/">investigation</a> documenting how the CIA had managed to infiltrate U.S. and global media. The CIA had placed hundreds of agents into newsrooms and had convinced hundreds more reporters to collaborate with them. These included individuals at some of the most influential outlets, including <i>The New York Times</i>. The CIA needed to do this clandestinely because any attempt to do so openly would harm the effectiveness of the operation and provoke stiff public resistance. But by 2015, there was barely a murmur of disapproval when <i>Reuters</i> announced that it was hiring 33-year veteran CIA manager and director Dawn Scalici as a global director, even when the company <a href="https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en-us/posts/authors/dawn-scalici/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that her primary responsibility was to “advanc[e] Thomson Reuters’ ability to meet the disparate needs of the U.S. government.”</p>
<p>Facebook, however, is vastly more influential than the <i>New York Times</i> or <i>Reuters</i>, reaching billions of people daily. In that sense, it stands to reason that it would be a prime target of any intelligence organization. It has become so big and ubiquitous that many consider it a de facto public commons and believe it should no longer be treated as a private company. Considering who is making many of the decisions on the platform, that distinction between public and private entities is even more blurry than many presume.</p>

					<p>There’s a lot to like about the Rationalist community, but they do have a certain tendency to spawn — shall we say — high demand groups. We sent a card-carrying Rat to investigate what’s really going on.</p>
				<div>
											<div><p>The rationalist community was drawn together by AI researcher Eliezer Yudkowsky’s blog post series The Sequences, a set of essays about how to think more rationally. You would think, then, that they’d be paragons of critical thinking and skepticism — or at least that they wouldn’t wind up summoning demons. &nbsp;</p><p>And yet, the rationalist community has hosted perhaps half a dozen small groups with very strange beliefs (including two separate groups that wound up interacting with demons). Some — which I won’t name in this article for privacy reasons — seem to have caused no harm but bad takes. But the most famous, a loose group of vegan anarchist transhumanists nicknamed the Zizians, have been linked to <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/delirious-violent-impossible-true-story-zizians/">six violent deaths</a>. Other groups, while less violent, have left a trail of trauma in their wake. One is Black Lotus, a Burning Man camp led by alleged rapist Brent Dill, which developed a metaphysical system based on the tabletop roleplaying game Mage the Ascension. Another is Leverage Research, an independent research organization that became sucked into the occult and wound up as Workplace Harassment With New Age Characteristics.&nbsp;</p><p>For this article, I spoke to ten people who were associated with various rationalist-adjacent groups, including Black Lotus, Leverage Research, and the Zizians. I also spoke with people who were familiar with the early development of the rationalist community. I myself am a rationalist, and the rationalist community is closely knit; my interviewees included exes, former clients, and the dad of my kid’s best friend. I am close to my subject in a way most journalists aren’t. At the same time, I got an unprecedented level of access and honesty from members of a community that is often hostile to outsiders.&nbsp;</p></div>

											<p><h2>The problem of young rationalists</h2>
</p>
											<div><p>The rationalist community as a whole is remarkably functional. Like any subculture, it is rife with gossip, personality conflicts, and drama that is utterly incomprehensible to outsiders. But overall, the community’s activities are less drinking the Kool-Aid and more mutual support and vegan-inclusive summer barbeques.&nbsp;</p><p>Nevertheless, some groups within the community have wound up wildly <em>dys</em>functional–a term I’m using to sidestep definitional arguments about what is and isn’t a cult. And some of the blame can be put on the rationalist community’s marketing.</p><p>The Sequences make certain implicit promises. <em>There is an art of thinking better, and we’ve figured it out. If you learn it, you can solve all your problems, become brilliant and hardworking and successful and happy, and be one of the small elite shaping not only society but the entire future of humanity.&nbsp;</em></p><p>This is, not to put too fine a point on it, not true.&nbsp;</p><p>Multiple interviewees remarked that the Sequences create the raw material for a cult. To his credit, their author, Eliezer Yudkowsky, shows little interest in running one. He has consistently been distant from and uninvolved in rationalist community-building efforts, from Benton House (the first rationalist group house) to today’s Lightcone Infrastructure (which hosts LessWrong, an online forum, and Lighthaven, a conference center). He surrounds himself with people who disagree with him, discourages social isolation, and rarely directs his fans to do anything other than read his BDSM-themed fanfiction.&nbsp;</p><p>But people who are drawn to the rationalist community by the Sequences often <em>want</em> to be in a cult. To be sure, no one wants to be exploited or traumatized. But they want some trustworthy authority to change the way they think until they become perfect, and then to assign them to their role in the grand plan to save humanity. They’re disappointed to discover a community made of mere mortals, with no brain tricks you can’t get from Statistics 101 and a good CBT workbook, whose approach to world problems involves a lot fewer grand plans and a lot more muddling through.</p><p>Black Lotus used a number of shared frameworks, including the roleplaying game Mage: the Ascension, that would allow them to cut through social norms and exercise true agency over their lives. Brent supposedly had the most insight into the framework, and so had a lot of control over the members of Black Lotus — control he was unable to use wisely.&nbsp;</p><p>However, if Brent wasn’t there, Black Lotus would have been fine. One interviewee said that, when Brent wasn’t there, Black Lotus led to beautiful peak experiences that he still cherishes: “Brent surrounded himself with people who built the thing he yearned for, missed, and couldn’t have.”&nbsp;</p><p>But in other cases — as in Leverage Research — the toxic dynamics emerged from the&nbsp; bottom up. Interviewees with experience at Leverage Research were clear that there was no single wrongdoer. Leverage was fractured into many smaller research groups, which did everything from writing articles about the grand scope of human history to incubating a cryptocurrency. Some research groups stayed basically normal to the end; others spiralled into self-perpetuating cycles of abuse. In those research groups, everyone was a victim and everyone was a perpetrator. The trainer who broke you down in a marathon six-hour debugging session was unable to sleep because of the panic attacks caused by her own.</p><p>Worse, the promise of the Sequences is more appealing to people who have very serious life problems they need desperately to solve. While some members of dysfunctional rationalist groups are rich, stable, and as neurotypical as rationalists ever get, most are in precarious life positions: mentally ill (sometimes severely), traumatized, survivors of abuse, unemployed, barely able to scrape together enough money to find a place to sleep at night in the notoriously high-rent Bay Area. Members of dysfunctional rationalist groups are particularly likely to be transgender: transgender people are often cut off by their families and may have a difficult time finding friends who accept them as they are. The dysfunctional group can feel like a safe haven from the transphobic world.&nbsp;</p><p>People in vulnerable positions are both more likely to wind up mistreated and less likely to be able to leave. Elizabeth Van Nostrand, who knows many members of dysfunctional groups both rationalist and non-rationalist, said, “I know people who've had very good experiences in organizations where other people had very bad ones. Sometimes different people come out of the same group with very different experiences, and one of the major differences is whether they feel secure enough to push back or leave if they need to. There isn't a substitute for a good BATNA.”<sup>

</sup>
</p><p>Still, vulnerability alone can’t explain why some members of the rationalist community end up in abusive groups. Mike Blume was a member of Benton House, which was intended to recruit talented young rationalists. He said, “I was totally coming out of a super depressive and dysfunctional phase in my life, and this was a big upswing in my mood and ability to do things. We were doing something really important. In retrospect, I feel like this is the sort of thing you can't do forever. You burn out on it eventually. But I would wake up in the morning and I'd be a little bit tired and trying to get out of bed and I'd be like, well, you know, the lightcone<sup>
    <!-- <a id="fnref-2" href="#fn-2"> -->
    <span id="fnref-2">
        2    </span>
    <!-- </a> -->
</sup>
 depends on me getting out of bed and going to sleep and learning how to program. So I'd better get on that.”</p><p>Mike Blume was depressed, lonely, and unemployed when he entered the rationalist community, and he sincerely believed in both the art of rationality and the importance of the cause. The difference wasn’t his vulnerability. The difference was that his community helped him use his idealism and belief in the cause to learn real skills, become less depressed, and get to a more stable place.</p><p>One interviewee observed that the early rationalist community had been more supportive of less functional rationalists, perhaps because it was smaller. While it wasn’t capable of transforming them into a superhumanly rational elite (no one can do that), it helped them learn useful skills, and become independent. This interviewee said that, once the early rationalists became functional, they pulled the ladder up behind them. They (understandably) only wanted to hang out with people who already have their shit together. But without the support of more successful people, less functional new rationalists can be easy prey for anyone willing to offer help. &nbsp;</p><p>I’m not sure I agree. The early rationalist community had a number of success stories; it also had a guy that multiple people referred to, sighed, and said “that wasn’t a cult, he just did too many whippets.” The rationalist community I see provides a lot of support to many people who are neurodivergent, traumatized, or transgender; it also fails a lot of people. &nbsp;</p></div>
											<p><h2>Taking ideas seriously</h2>
</p>
											<div><p>When discussing dysfunctional or abusive groups, many academics treat their beliefs as secondary. The real coercive control comes from threats or sleep deprivation, social isolation or the manipulations of the leader; the beliefs are so many rationalizations. Most of my interviewees took great pains to say that this wasn’t true for them. While the problems were certainly exacerbated by social isolation and other interpersonal dynamics, the core reason for the dysfunctionality was the beliefs.</p><p>It’s difficult to understand the internal dynamics of the Zizians. They don’t have former members, and members tend to isolate themselves from their former friends. So anything I say about them is inherently speculative.</p><p>However, my interviewees and my own experiences are unequivocal: when the Zizians stabbed their landlord with a katana or got in a shootout with the cops, this was <em>really actually</em> because they believed an obscure version of decision theory that meant that you should always escalate when threatened. Social isolation likely made these beliefs seem more plausible, and their&nbsp; meditation techniques — including their belief that half of the brain can fall asleep while the other half remains awake, known as “hemispheric sleep” — likely made them less able to reason rationally.&nbsp;</p><p>But, long before weapons and violence were brought into the mix, Zizians seriously and coherently argued for their unusual version of decision theory. Their actions derive directly from beliefs they had for years. And several Zizians behaved violently without any opportunity for anyone to exercise coercive control. Most notably, Maximilian Snyder allegedly murdered Curtis Lind, who was the primary witness in the case against several Zizians. Before he was arrested, Snyder seems to have had little contact with Ziz other than reading her blog.</p><p>Leverage Research put a lot of work into developing a grand unified theory of psychology. What they called “Connection Theory” purported to explain how people’s goals, beliefs, and other mental processes interrelated. “Charting”— diagramming how an individual’s mental processes are connected — would allow people to understand themselves and resolve their mental problems. Charting was combined with “belief reporting”: setting a firm intention to tell the truth and then saying what you ‘really’ believe.</p><p>People would try to act in accordance with the artificially simple model of the mind created by these techniques, which could in itself cause mental health problems. For example, someone who belief-reported that they didn’t love their partner could wind up breaking up with their partner, even if in reality it just reflected transient irritation. But Leverage soon noticed that Connection Theory wasn’t a complete explanation of the mind. They began to explore alternate models, such as bodywork.&nbsp;</p><p>Through their explorations of bodywork and other “woo” practices, Leverage researchers began to believe that mental processes can interact and pass from mind to mind through microexpressions and other subconscious things. Leverage researchers initially used “demons” as a metaphor for these mental processes, but over time many researchers became more convinced that the occult was a real, powerful way to manipulate the subconscious. Occult beliefs pervaded many research groups. Routine tasks, such as deciding whose turn it was to pick up the groceries, required working around other people’s beliefs in demons, magic, and other paranormal phenomena. Eventually these beliefs collided with preexisting social conflict, and Leverage broke apart into factions that fought with each other internally through occult rituals.&nbsp;</p><p>Similarly, Brent promoted a cynical version of the world, in which humans were inherently bad, selfish, and engaged in constant deception of themselves and others. He taught that people make all their choices for hidden reasons: men, mostly to get sex; women, mostly to get resources for their children. Whenever someone outside Black Lotus made a choice, Brent would dissect it to reveal the hidden selfish motivations. Whenever someone outside Black Lotus was well-respected or popular, Brent would point out (or make up) ways that they were exploiting those weaker than them for their own benefit. This became a self-fulfilling prophecy. One interviewee identified this ideology as the worst harm of Black Lotus, more than sexual boundary violations or being coerced into taking drugs. It took a long time to rebuild their ability to trust and have faith in other people.</p><p>Jessica Taylor, an AI researcher who knew both Zizians and participants in Leverage Research, put it bluntly. “There’s this belief [among rationalists],” she said, “that society has these really bad behaviors, like developing self-improving AI, or that mainstream epistemology is really bad–not just religion, but also normal ‘trust-the-experts’ science. That can lead to the idea that we should figure it out ourselves. And what can show up is that some people aren't actually smart enough to form very good conclusions once they start thinking for themselves.”</p><p>One way that thinking for yourself goes wrong is that you realize your society is wrong about something, don’t realize that you can’t outperform it, and wind up even wronger. But another potential failure is that, knowing both that your society is wrong and that you can’t do better, you start looking for someone even more right. Paradoxically, the desire to ignore the experts can make rationalists more vulnerable to a charismatic leader. &nbsp;</p><p>Or, as Jessica Taylor said, “They do outsource their thinking to others, but not to the typical authorities.”</p><p>In and of itself, that dynamic is bad but not necessarily seriously so. Many effective altruists–members of a community closely linked to the rationality community–similarly defer to more experienced effective altruists. While effective altruists <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Jx6ncakmergiC74kG/deference-culture-in-ea">have widely critiqued this habit</a>, it results only in poorly thought out viewpoints about charity evaluation, not in violent crime. But bad actors can easily take advantage of the desire to find someone to think for you. If you’re using neither the normal error-checking processes of society nor your own mind, how can you tell if someone is wrong?</p><p>A rationalist virtue is “taking ideas seriously”: when you are convinced of a belief, you notice all its implications and act on them. Another rationalist virtue is “agency”: taking actions to pursue your goals, even if the actions are unusual or break the rules. Together, these are dangerous. We know what happens if you do normal things; an enormous number of previous normal people have found that out for us..&nbsp;</p><p>But if you’re using your decision theory to make decisions and not just to get a PhD in mathematics, it really matters that you chose correctly. If you’re using your all-encompassing theory of human psychology to decide how to treat people, it really matters that you actually understand it. And all of these are more dangerous if, instead of following reasoning you understand, you’re deferring to the judgment of someone else who seems like they’ve thought about it a lot. &nbsp;</p><p>Agency and taking ideas seriously aren’t bad. Rationalists came to correct views about the COVID-19 pandemic while many others were saying masks didn’t work and only hypochondriacs worried about covid; rationalists were some of the first people to warn about the threat of artificial intelligence. If you want better outcomes than normal people, then you also need to do something different than what normal people do. But diverging from the norm is often risky and the risks have often not been taken seriously.</p></div>
											<p><h2>Beware psychology</h2>
</p>
											<div><p>The most interesting question I asked my interviewees was “what was your day-to-day life in the group like?”</p><p>Here is a sampling of answers from people in and close to dysfunctional groups: “We spent all our time talking about philosophy and psychology and human social dynamics, often within the group.” “Really tense ten-hour conversations about whether, when you ate the last chip, that was a signal that you were intending to let down your comrades in selfish ways in the future.” “Like somebody's going through a real bad breakup and you need to, like, hold their hair out of the toilet over text, tell them that it's going to be okay and help them put their life back together, except for years.”&nbsp;</p><p>Conversely, when I asked interviewees in high-demand groups that wound up basically functional, like Benton House, they gave answers like: “I learned to drive, which was really important. I got my first programming job. We played calibration games and a rationalist version of Family Feud called Schelling Point.” "I wrote LessWrong posts and started a rationalist fiction novel, helped someone immigrate, and once scrambled like thirty eggs in a wok."</p><p>One Black Lotus member wanted to emphasize to me that Black Lotus wasn’t all bad. The abuse was real. But he had been stuck in a dead-end job for years when Brent Dill looked at him and said “you’re smart, you can be in charge of build for my Burning Man camp.” Suddenly, he was putting in sixteen-hour days running a team of a dozen people, and he was <em>good </em>at it. He realized that he could manage people, troubleshoot problems, and build something he was proud of. He felt capable in a way he never had before.&nbsp;</p><p>Similarly, interviewees who knew about Leverage Research emphasized that some research groups were much more dysfunctional than others. Research groups that focused on real-world goals — like incubating the cryptocurrency <a href="https://reserve.org/">Reserve</a> — tended to be more functional. On the other hand, research groups that focused on ten-hour debugging sessions using Connection Theory were recognized even within the group as being cultier.&nbsp;</p><p>The rationalist organization the Center for Applied Rationality seems at first blush like an exception to this rule. It develops curricula and teaches workshops about how to think more rationally, but — while in the past it occasionally blurred the line between rationality curriculum development, people management, and therapy — it doesn’t seem to have approached the level of Leverage Research. CFAR mostly tests its newly developed rationality techniques on outside volunteers, for about an hour each. They don’t do eight-hour debugging sessions. They also strove to be empirical as best they could. If a technique seemed to make workshop participants happier and better off, it stayed; otherwise, it was removed. &nbsp;</p><p>Rationalist groups tend to be functional to the extent that their activities involve learning to program, writing papers for general publication, building a giant dome on the playa, or otherwise interacting with the real world. Rationalist groups tend to be dysfunctional to the extent that their activities involve very long conversations about human psychology and social dynamics, especially dynamics within the group itself. Relatedly, the clearest-cut cases of rationalists being right have involved external events in the world and not the nature of human beings.</p><p>Diving deep into human psychology isn’t an unusual pattern for the Bay Area: from Esalen to Circling, many groups outside the rationalist community become obsessed with the inner workings of the mind and how they manifest in the group dynamic. But I think this obsession tends to inflame a number of harmful dynamics. They, of course, offer a lot of opportunities for bad actors to manipulate group members, but even if everyone involved is well-intentioned they end badly. There is no conflict so small that five hours straight of emotional processing can’t make it feel both profoundly important and profoundly unsolvable. This kind of conversation leads to guilt and shame when you don’t measure up; it leads to paranoia and isolation when outsiders don’t. And without the steadying influence of some kind of external goal you either achieve or don’t achieve, your beliefs can get arbitrarily disconnected from reality — which is very dangerous if you’re going to act on them.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>One interviewee said, “One kind of cult you can have is when you and ten of your closest friends all live in a house together and you have the blackout curtains drawn and a lot of MDMA, and you sit around and talk about the implications of the whatever.” The rationalist community keeps spawning groups like this. Most are nothing but a (possibly fun) waste of time. But when the conversations become fraught and obsessively inward-facing, it can spawn Leverage Research, or Black Lotus, or the Zizians.<sup>

</sup>
&nbsp;</p><p>Unlike agency or taking ideas seriously, I feel no compunctions about warning against very long, stressful conversations alternating between broader theories of human psychology and specific processing of the group members’ emotions. That kind of conversation is neither fun nor productive. If you’re having a tense conversation about feelings for ten hours, you might not be in a cult, but <em>something</em> has gone wrong.&nbsp;</p></div>
											<p><h2>Consequentialism&nbsp;</h2>
</p>
											<div><p>Several interviewees identified consequentialism as one of the riskier ideas to take seriously.&nbsp;</p><p>Brent Dill convinced some people that he was an extraordinary genius who would be capable of fantastic achievements, just as soon as he stopped being depressed. Therefore, from a consequentialist perspective, you should focus your effort on fixing his depression, no matter how much time or money or emotional energy it takes (and if you could throw your vagina into the bargain that would help too). The costs to you, no matter how large, are outweighed by the benefit a non-depressed Brent could bring to the world.</p><p>Several interviewees noted particular risks from overriding harms. “The issue is that ‘something, something dead babies’ justifies an awful lot,” said one interviewee. The long-term benefit that rationalists tend to be most worried about is AI. Many rationalists believe that an artificial general intelligence (AGI) will be developed very soon: for example, a mostly-rationalist team wrote the forecast <a href="https://ai-2027.com/">AI 2027</a>. Many of them also expect that, without heroic effort, AGI development will lead to human extinction.&nbsp;</p><p>These beliefs can make it difficult to care about much of anything else: what good is it to be a nurse or a notary or a novelist, if humanity is about to go extinct? Unfortunately, many people simply don’t have the skills to become AI policymakers or technical AI safety researchers. The vulnerable people particularly attracted by the Sequences are especially likely to not have enough work ethic or mental health to be able to contribute.&nbsp;</p><p>What do you do? You attach yourself to any project that seems like it might be able to help. The lucky ones accumulate a stack of rejections, or aimlessly drift from small grant to small grant and from badly-run nonprofit to badly-run nonprofit. The unlucky ones get sucked into a dysfunctional group.&nbsp;</p><p>Many people keep having the tense psychology discussions I talked about because they think AI is important and right now they can’t do anything to help. If you’re acutely aware that your ADHD or your trauma, your depression or your subclinical procrastination tendencies, are keeping you from preventing human extinction, then you’d do anything to fix it.&nbsp;</p><p>The overwhelming stakes of AGI can lead to a dangerous sense of grandiosity. “It’s a story in which they matter and in which it is justified for them to do weird stuff and stand up for themselves,” said an interviewee familiar with the Zizians. “Every action has great meaning, and that hooks into people in two ways. One of which is that it's empowering, and the other of which is that it's a great trigger for becoming obsessed with whether you're a bad person.”</p><p>He continued, “It makes it easy for small things to seem very big. And I think it also&nbsp; makes it easy for big things to seem sort of the same size as small things. When you get pulled over and then you get in a gunfight with the cops or whatever, this is the same level of treating the situation like it is anomalous or a big deal as having an argument about who washed the dishes.”</p><p>Early rationalist writing, such as the Sequences and the Harry Potter fanfiction <em>Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality</em>, emphasized the lone hero, standing defiantly against an uncaring world. But the actual process of saving the world is not very glamorous. It involves filling out paperwork, making small tweaks to code, running A/B tests on Twitter posts. Most rationalists — like Mike Blume — adjust well to the normalcy of world-saving. (Today he works as a programmer and donates to AI safety and global health nonprofits, a common rationalist career trajectory.) Others want acts of heroism as grand as the threat they face.</p><p>The Zizians and researchers at Leverage Research both felt like heroes, like some of the most important people who had ever lived. Of course, these groups couldn’t conjure up a literal Dark Lord to fight. But they could imbue everything with a profound sense of meaning. All the minor details of their lives felt like they had the fate of humanity or all sentient life as the stakes. Even the guilt and martyrdom could be perversely appealing: you could know that you’re the kind of person who would sacrifice everything for your beliefs.&nbsp;</p><p>The project itself in each of these dysfunctional groups was vague, free-floating, and almost magical. As soon as you have to accomplish specific goals in the real world, the mundanity of everyday life comes flooding in, with its endless slog of tasks variously boring, frustrating, and annoying. But as long as you’re sitting in a room taking LSD with the blackout curtains over the windows, you can be Superman.&nbsp;</p></div>
											<p><h2>Beware isolation</h2>
</p>
											<div><p>When asked how people could tell that their project wasn’t a cult, one interviewee said, “You leave the house regularly. Or if there's an office, you leave <em>both</em> the office and the house regularly.”&nbsp;</p><p>A recurring theme in my interviews was social isolation and groupthink: speaking primarily or only to people inside the group; rejecting dissidents or outsiders as unenlightened, as ignorant, as evil. Several people remarked that the main sign that someone had become a Zizian was that they disappeared from the Internet for a few months, and the next you hear from them is a news article talking about how they’re wanted for murder.&nbsp;</p><p>Interviewees particularly emphasized the epistemic problems created by social isolation. People tend to check in with the people around them to see whether their actions or beliefs are reasonable. But if you want to trick someone into believing absolute nonsense, you can introduce them to four people who already believe it and keep them away from critics. Then it seems like “everyone” agrees.&nbsp;</p><p>Sometimes this dynamic was created deliberately. If one of his followers objected to his behavior, Brent Dill would ask a few of his other followers to talk to them about it. Even if three of them told Brent Dill he was in the wrong, the fourth might agree — and that was the one Brent sent to talk to the dissident. &nbsp;</p><p>Other times, the dynamic occurred more-or-less by accident. Researchers at Leverage all lived together, which seemed like a reasonable cost-saving measure. Researchers typically socialized and dated within the group. Leverage took care of many of its researchers’ needs: meals, transportation, even handling their mail. When members had mental health crises due to unpacking their trauma in debugging sessions, Leverage stepped in to make sure their needs were met. Although apparently compassionate, this pattern meant that many researchers got everything from Leverage: sense of purpose and meaning, work, therapy, friendship, romance, food, housing, and routine life maintenance. Connections to the outside world often faded. Some researchers, after they left, found themselves helpless in the wider world.&nbsp;</p><p>Sometimes, the broader rationalist community played into this isolation. Members of organizations that were on the outs among rationalists, including Leverage Research, have trouble talking about their work at parties. Instead of normal small talk, they find themselves having to justify or apologize for their group. Naturally, they wind up going to fewer parties — and losing contact with the broader rationalist community.&nbsp;</p><p>Leverage Research didn’t like firing people. When a researcher was a poor fit, or the program they’d originally joined closed, they were shuffled from group to group. That explains some of the wildly different experiences people had at Leverage: Leverage didn’t expel people who really shouldn’t have been there, either because Connection Theory was harming them or because they were hurting others. &nbsp;</p><p>The isolation and groupthink was reinforced by a culture of secrecy. The norm was that individual research groups kept their research secret, even from other research groups within Leverage. That meant that the more functional research groups couldn’t provide a check on the less functional groups. Without much ability to learn what other research groups were actually doing, dysfunctional research groups became paranoid about (sometimes demon-related) sabotage — further isolating themselves from any kind of outside influence.&nbsp;</p></div>
											<p><h2>Conclusion</h2>
</p>
											<div><p>One of my interviewees speculated that rationalists aren’t actually any more dysfunctional than anywhere else; we’re just more <em>interestingly </em>dysfunctional. Dysfunctional workplaces, rape, abuse, and even murder aren’t unusual. People are more interested in rape or murder when it has a complicated and unusual philosophical justification, but we shouldn’t confuse being more fun to talk about with being more common.&nbsp;</p><p>Bearing that possibility in mind, what conclusions does my project suggest?</p><p>To some extent, dysfunctional rationalist groups are a product of features of rationalist culture that rationalists would rather not give up. For better or worse, rationalists want to act on their beliefs, and they want to do things differently from the society around them. But I believe it is possible to reduce the number of dysfunctional groups and how damaging they are.</p><p>For individuals concerned about joining a dysfunctional group, I suggest:</p><p>1. If your relationship with a person or a group consists mostly of discussions about human psychology and social dynamics, that is a yellow flag. It is a red flag if:<br>a. The conversations are many hours long and displace other activities in your life.<br>b. The conversations generally focus on group members’ feelings and interactions, rather than social science or philosophy.<br>c. The conversations are tense, stressful, and not fun.&nbsp;</p><p>2. Try to do things where there is some external gauge of whether you’re succeeding at them or not. Similarly, try to test your beliefs against reality.&nbsp;</p><p>3. Maintain multiple social groups. Ideally, have several friends who aren’t rationalists.&nbsp;</p><p>4. Keep your work, housing, and therapy separate.&nbsp;</p><p>5. Before assuming that something is true because everyone else seems to believe it, either check the argument yourself or talk to someone outside the friend group and who wasn’t introduced to you by anyone in the group.&nbsp;</p><p>6. The longer and more abstract a chain of reasoning is, the less you should believe it. This is particularly true if the chain of reasoning concludes:<br>a. That it’s okay to do something that hurts people.<br>b. That something is of such overwhelming importance that nothing else matters.&nbsp;</p><p>7. Be cautious about joining high-demand groups if you have nowhere else to go.&nbsp;</p><p>My recommendations for the general rationalist community are:</p><p>If someone is in a group that is heading towards dysfunctionality, try to maintain your relationship with them; don’t attack them or make them defend the group. Let them have normal conversations with you.&nbsp;</p><p>Think carefully about how we can create more realistic expectations in new rationalists and whether it would be possible to offer more of them the support they need to become useful community members.</p><p>Give people realistic expectations about whether they will ever be able to get a job in AI safety. Don’t act like people are uncool or their lives are pointless if they can’t work in AI safety.&nbsp;</p><p>Consider talking about “ethical injunctions:” things you shouldn’t do even if you have a really good argument that you should do them. (Like murder.)&nbsp;</p></div>

			<h4>11 August 2025</h4>
			<p><em>"… all of this ended up in storage rooms, and everything became rotten and full of holes, and he himself finally turned into some kind of hole in humanity."</em> <label for="sidenote-93ddda7838c7ad12371082b0cf1d67ff4bdc19533c6c2fa9de1c1ad52834c956">✪</label><span><span>✪</span>“…все это сваливалось в кладовые, и все становилось гниль и прореха, и сам он обратился наконец в какую-то прореху на человечестве.”</span></p>
<p>— <del>Google</del> Gogol, <a href="https://ilibrary.ru/text/78/p.7/index.html"><em>Dead Souls</em> Vol. 1, Chp. 6</a></p>
<p>In <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101001064512/http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/12/making-urls-shorter-for-google-toolbar.html">December 2009</a>, Google launched a URL shortening service alongside an update to their toolbar and FeedBurner. TechCrunch heralded the new service as the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101001083657/https://techcrunch.com/2010/09/30/googlegoo-gl-is-a-go-the-stablest-most-secure-and-fastest-url-shortener-on-the-web/">“Stablest, Most Secure, And Fastest URL Shortener On The Web”</a> in an article released at the time. Those words — stable, secure, fast — weren’t chosen by an overexcited editor either, they appear on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091217094012/http://goo.gl/">goo.gl website on day one</a>.</p>
<p>Smash cut to July 2024, when <a href="https://developers.googleblog.com/en/google-url-shortener-links-will-no-longer-be-available/">Google announces</a> in a blog post that their super stable and secure URL shortener is getting nuked from orbit in just over a year.</p>

The bottom of the right panel is super-imposed text that reads '2024'." role="img"></a>

<p>Now, I know I’m framing this as a completely unforseen outcome, a surprise betrayal, but the truth is that folks knew this would happen from the get-go. <a href="https://luxagraf.net/">Scott Gilbertson</a> wrote this in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100408045015/http://www.webmonkey.com/2009/12/google_jumps_on_the_url-shortening_bandwagon_with_goodotgl">an article for Webmonkey/Wired</a> covering the services introduction in 2009:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Of course the bigger problems with URL shorteners — link-rot, spam and redirect mishaps to name a few — are still problems regardless of whether the shortener is controlled by Google or anyone else. And for anyone who thinks that Google services have a better chance of being around far into the future, may we remind you that Google Notebook, Google Answers and several other services have disappeared over the years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Prescient, right? The fact is that URL shorteners which don’t share their database (read: all URL shortners if you round up) are a terrible, no good, very bad idea. Link rot makes us amnesiacs, and if our history is our future, it’s looking very hazy.</p>
<h2 id="the-resistance">The Resistance</h2>
<p>Time and time again, moments before the ossified arches of a website are set to crumble due to active neglect by the arsonists on payroll in Mergers &amp; Acquisitions, a certain brigade of ragtag vigilantes always rush in to save the furniture and family photos. I’m of course talking about the famed <a href="https://archiveteam.org/">Archive Team</a>.</p>
<p>The Archive Team are the same folks that saved <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2009/04/28/geocities_preservation/">Geocities</a> from Yahoo!, <a href="https://gizmodo.com/were-archiving-yahoo-answers-so-youll-always-know-how-b-1846643969">Yahoo! Answers</a> from Yahoo!, and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/12/11/these-crusaders-want-preserve-human-culture-online-their-latest-target-yahoo-groups/">Yahoo! Groups</a> from… uh… well, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2021/04/how-yahoo-became-internet-villain/618681/">you know</a>.</p>
<p>Now, I know what you’re thinking now: “wow, these Archive Team people are the coolest ever, I bet they have clear skin and healthy hair”. Well, what if I could tell you that anyone who can operate a terminal can join the war effort in as little as two commands. Despair not if you don’t meet that description but desire to join the club, it’s also pretty easy to do by pointing and clicking.</p>
<h2 id="enlisting-in-the-fight-against-link-rot">Enlisting in the Fight Against Link Rot</h2>
<p>To join in the effort to help stem the damage goo.gl’s shutdown will cause, the Archive Team is trying to map all the short URLs (<em>e.g.</em>, <code>http://goo.gl/gEdpoS</code>) to their long URLs (<em>e.g.</em>, <code>https://www.clubic.com/int...</code>). How do we do that? Well it’s very simple, and very stupid:</p>
<ol>
<li>Visit a goo.gl short link.</li>
<li>Observe what URL it redirects to, if any.</li>
<li>Do this again for every possible short link.</li>
</ol>
<p>As best as I can tell from the Archive Team tracker, it looks like there are about <del>3 billion</del> 230 billion<label for="sidenote-dcd0837b899bc60769b94246e448d3a3f914640aadb0a821f6612f301807a1f2">✪</label><span><span>✪</span>Thanks to arkiver on the Archive Team IRC for correcting this number.</span> links that need visiting. That’s just too many for one person to do. At the time of writing, <strong>there’s less than two weeks left to archive all these links</strong>.</p>
<p>Luckily, the Archive Team have put together a handy programme that automates this. It’s so easy to use that &gt;3,000<label for="sidenote-af20bb82e7c1f18070cfc4c8f24375d6a85082e086bda45836f021bc42031741">✪</label><span><span>✪</span>A quick estimate from quickly grep’ing the <a href="https://tracker.archiveteam.org/goo-gl/">leaderboard</a> so don’t hold me to that number.</span> other folks have used it to save goo.gl short links.</p>
<p>As I alluded to, there are two ways to run this programme (known as the Archive Team <a href="https://wiki.archiveteam.org/index.php/ArchiveTeam_Warrior">Warrior</a>). It’s super easy and anyone can do it. Just don’t use a VPN or run this over an ISP that will block or alter websites. More info <a href="https://wiki.archiveteam.org/index.php/ArchiveTeam_Warrior#Can_I_use_whatever_internet_access_for_the_Warrior?">here</a> about that.</p>
<h3 id="using-the-command-line-and-docker">Using the Command Line and Docker</h3>
<p>Quoting from the <del>sacred texts</del> <a href="https://wiki.archiveteam.org/index.php/ArchiveTeam_Warrior">Archive Team wiki</a>, you need simply:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/">Download and install Docker</a></li>
<li>Open your terminal on Mac and Linux, or your Command Prompt on Windows.</li>
<li>Copy/paste the first encantation</li>
</ol>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span>docker run --detach --name watchtower --restart<span>=</span>on-failure --volume /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock containrrr/watchtower --label-enable --include-restarting --cleanup --interval <span>3600</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><ol start="4">

</span></span></code></pre></div><ol start="5">
<li>Visit <code>http://localhost:8001</code></li>
</ol>
<p>And that’s it! Follow the on-screen instructions and make sure you click on the Goo.gl project (selecting “ArchiveTeam’s Choice” will do it). You can run this on your desktop or laptop, or even better yet, set-it-and-forget-it on a VPS or server somewhere in cloud land.</p>
<p>If you can’t/won’t use Docker, here are instructions for how to do this with <a href="https://wiki.archiveteam.org/index.php/ArchiveTeam_Warrior#Installing_and_running_with_Podman">Podman</a> and <a href="https://wiki.archiveteam.org/index.php/ArchiveTeam_Warrior#Installing_and_running_with_Orbstack">Orbstack</a>.</p>
<h3 id="pointing-and-clicking-with-virtualbox">Pointing and Clicking with VirtualBox</h3>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">Install VirtualBox</a></li>
<li>Grab the <a href="https://warriorhq.archiveteam.org/downloads/warrior4/archiveteam-warrior-v4.1-20240906.ova">Warrior Virtual Machine</a></li>
<li>In VirtualBox, click File &gt; Import Appliance… and open the file.</li>
<li>Start the virtual machine.</li>
<li>Outside of the virtual machine (<em>i.e.</em>, on your host), visit <code>http://localhost:8001</code></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="im-doing-my-part">“I’m Doing My Part!”</h2>
<p>I started running the Warrior on the 9th of August and, according to the <a href="https://tracker.archiveteam.org/goo-gl/">leaderboard</a>, I’ve uploaded more than 370,000 URLs, or about 14Gb worth at the time of writing<label for="sidenote-a4758764483dacd5447ee072256a27443ec300c88223948d4758d8f83d623b88">✪</label><span><span>✪</span>If you’re thinking the data size and the number of URLs is disproportionate, I’m right with you. I’m not sure what the deal is, but I know I’m misunderstanding something about the leaderboard.</span> other folks have used it to save goo.gl short links. We have less than two weeks with just under half a billion left to go as of the night of the 11th of August.</p>

<p>I’m not going to lie, I am more than a little bit motivated by the fact that I am above the median of individuals who’ve backed up goo.gl URLs (as judged by the position of the scroll bar when I Ctrl+F <code>jszym</code>). But I’ve also spent untold hours on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/">Wayback Machine</a> and the <a href="https://geocities.restorativland.org/">Geocities Gallery</a>. I’ve made stuff for the internet, relied on services to keep it around, and have them disappear due to capital interests or indifference. I’m happy to think that there is a very remote chance that I’m helping someone in the future unlock the secrets of our collective past.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Artificial intelligence (AI) developers are increasingly building language models with warm and empathetic personas that millions of people now use for advice, therapy, and companionship. Here, we show how this creates a significant trade-off: optimizing language models for warmth undermines their reliability, especially when users express vulnerability. We conducted controlled experiments on five language models of varying sizes and architectures, training them to produce warmer, more empathetic responses, then evaluating them on safety-critical tasks. Warm models showed substantially higher error rates (+10 to +30 percentage points) than their original counterparts, promoting conspiracy theories, providing incorrect factual information, and offering problematic medical advice. They were also significantly more likely to validate incorrect user beliefs, particularly when user messages expressed sadness. Importantly, these effects were consistent across different model architectures, and occurred despite preserved performance on standard benchmarks, revealing systematic risks that current evaluation practices may fail to detect. As human-like AI systems are deployed at an unprecedented scale, our findings indicate a need to rethink how we develop and oversee these systems that are reshaping human relationships and social interaction.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      
      <p><em>Radicle is a peer-to-peer, local-first code
        collaboration stack built on Git.</em></p>

        <h2>Radicle 1.3.0</h2>
        <span>12.08.2025</span>
      </header>
      <p>The Radicle team is delighted to announce the release of Radicle 1.3.0
(29043134a). This release contains 48 commits by 7 contributors. We would like
to thank everyone for their continued effort in helping us improve the Radicle
protocol and tooling via their contributions and usage reports 👾</p>

<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>

<div><pre><code>curl -sSf https://radicle.xyz/install | sh -s -- --no-modify-path --version=1.3.0
</code></pre></div>

<h2 id="canonical-references">Canonical References</h2>

<p>This feature has been under way for quite some time, and we are proud to
announce that it’s ready for you to use!</p>

<p>Canonical reference rules have been introduced via an identity payload entry
under the identifier <code>xyz.radicle.crefs</code>. Here’s an example of the payload that
includes a single rule for tags that live under <code>refs/tags/releases/*</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code>"xyz.radicle.crefs": {
  "rules": {
    "refs/tags/releases/*": {
      "allow": [
        "did:key:z6MkkPvBfjP4bQmco5Dm7UGsX2ruDBieEHi8n9DVJWX5sTEz",
        "did:key:z6MkgFq6z5fkF2hioLLSNu1zP2qEL1aHXHZzGH1FLFGAnBGz",
        "did:key:z6MkireRatUThvd3qzfKht1S44wpm4FEWSSa4PRMTSQZ3voM"
      ],
      "threshold": 2
    }
  }
}
</code></pre></div>

<p>The canonical reference rules are now used to check for canonical updates. The
rule for the <code>defaultBranch</code> of an <code>xyz.radicle.project</code> is synthesized from the
identity document fields: <code>threshold</code> and <code>delegates</code>. This means that a rule
for that reference is not allowed within the rule set. This is checked when
performing a <code>rad id update</code>.</p>

<p>For a more detailed history and usage of canonical references, check out the
accompanying <a href="https://radicle.xyz/2025/08/12/canonical-references.html">post</a>.</p>

<h2 id="introducing-radicle-protocol">Introducing <code>radicle-protocol</code></h2>

<p>This set of changes is mostly cosmetic for the time being. A new crate,
<code>radicle-protocol</code>, was introduced to provide a home for a <a href="https://sans-io.readthedocs.io/">sans I/O</a>
implementation of the Radicle protocol. The crate currently defines the inner
workings of the protocol, and <code>radicle-node</code> depends on this.</p>

<p>Note here that we switched to use the <code>bytes</code> crate, and we witnessed a panic
from this crate while using a pre-release. It has not showed up again, but we
introduced the use of backtraces to help identify the issue further. So, please
report a backtrace if the <code>radicle-node</code> stops due to this issue.</p>

<h2 id="path-to-windows">Path to Windows</h2>

<p>We made an effort to start paving some of the way to being able to use Radicle
on Windows. The first step was taken for this, and you can now use the <code>rad</code> CLI
on a Windows machine – without WSL.</p>

<p>Currently, <code>git-remote-rad</code> and <code>radicle-node</code> are blockers for full Windows
support. However, the sans I/O approach mentioned above will provide a way
forward for implementing a <code>radicle-node</code> that works on Windows, and we will
continue to look into other fixes required for getting full Windows support.</p>

<h2 id="improved-log-rotation">Improved Log Rotation</h2>

<p>The rotation of logs under <code>.radicle/node</code> now works using a numbered system,
i.e. <code>node.log.1</code>, <code>node.log.2</code>, etc. The current running node will log to
<code>node.log</code>, which is a symlink to most recent number.</p>

<p>This means that logs will be persisted between runs, which will require
occasional cleanup.</p>

<h2 id="display-full-node-id">Display Full Node ID</h2>

<p>We have improved the formatting for Node IDs and node addresses. The CLI
will output shortened forms of NIDs and addresses when the output is transient,
and the full form where it is presented to the user. This will allow you to be
able to copy and paste these identifiers.</p>

<h2 id="stable-order-for-pinned-repositories">Stable Order for Pinned Repositories</h2>

<p>The pinned repositories now maintain their insertion order, meaning that they
should not be reordered by any other factors other than the user’s decision on
which repositories should appear first.</p>

<h2 id="relax-pushes-for-git-remote-rad">Relax Pushes for <code>git-remote-rad</code></h2>

<p>The <code>git-remote-rad</code> would always expect a working copy and a reference when
performing pushes. These constraints are relaxed to allow a bare Git repository
and any kind of Git revision. This should improve the experience for users of
<code>jj</code>.</p>

<h2 id="connect-attempts-will-error">Connect Attempts will Error</h2>

<p>If a connection attempt would not happen due to an error, the result of the
error was never returned. This would often lead to timeouts when using <code>rad node
connect</code>. We now return the error and can report it instead of waiting for a
timeout.</p>

<h2 id="default-branch-picker">Default Branch Picker</h2>

<p>When running <code>rad init</code> the default value for the <code>defaultBranch</code> of the
repository is now by provided the branch you are on or the Git configuration
option <code>init.defaultBranch</code>.</p>

						<img width="900" height="604" src="https://www.qodo.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Qodo-Command-scores-71.2-on-SWE-Bench-Verified.png" alt="" loading="lazy">					</figure>
					<p>We’re excited to announce that Qodo Command, our CLI agent, achieved a scored of 71.2% on SWE-bench Verified (submission pending review), the leading benchmark for evaluating AI agents on real-world software engineering tasks.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.qodo.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SWE-bench.png" alt="" width="900" height="604" srcset="https://www.qodo.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SWE-bench.png 900w, https://www.qodo.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SWE-bench-300x201.png 300w, https://www.qodo.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SWE-bench-768x515.png 768w, https://www.qodo.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SWE-bench-48x32.png 48w, https://www.qodo.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SWE-bench-58x39.png 58w, https://www.qodo.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SWE-bench-72x48.png 72w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"></p>
<p><span>This achievement is a strong signal that Qodo’s agents are built for the realities of production development. For use cases like reviewing code, writing tests, fixing bugs, and generating features, our CLI agent goes beyond autocomplete to deliver thoughtful, context-aware, and high-integrity code.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2 id="one-shot-real-world-execution">One-Shot, Real-World Execution</h2>
<p><span>Most AI benchmarks evaluate agents in isolated, simplified environments. However, SWE-bench Verified tests coding agents in messy, complex, real-world software engineering scenarios. Each test case in SWE-bench is built from a real GitHub issue in one of 12 widely-used, open-source Python repositories. Agents are given the GitHub issue and the codebase in the state it was in when the issue was opened, and must reason, plan, and edit code, iterating over many turns as a developer would – without shortcutting the problem.</span></p>
<p><span>Qodo Command scored 71.2% using a single run of the production version of Qodo Command—no finetuning or benchmark-specific adjustments—exactly the way any developer would by running it out-of-the-box with the simple install package</span>: <code>npm install -g @qodo/command.&nbsp;</code></p>
<h3 id="llm-model-flexibility-amp-claude-partnership">LLM Model Flexibility &amp; Claude Partnership</h3>
<p>While Qodo Command is designed to support all top-tier LLMs, Claude 4 emerged as our model of choice for SWE Bench Verified results. Thanks to a strong partnership with Anthropic—Qodo is a “<a href="https://www.anthropic.com/partners/powered-by-claude">Powered by Claude</a>” solution, we’re collaboratively building the world’s most adaptive and learning-oriented coding agents, leveraging one of the most advanced language models available today.</p>
<h2 id="the-architecture-behind-our-71-2-swe-bench-success">The Architecture Behind Our 71.2% SWE-bench success</h2>
<p>Achieving high performance on SWE-bench wasn’t about optimizing for the benchmark–it was the natural result of engineering Qodo Command to excel at real-world software engineering challenges. Here’s how our architectural decisions directly contributed to its performance:</p>
<h3 id="context-summarization">Context Summarization</h3>
<p>SWE-bench Verified tests AI on complex, muli-file codebases where understanding interdependencies is crucial for success. Succeeding in this environment requires more than feeding raw files to an LLM, pattern-matching or autocomplete.</p>
<p><span>Qodo Command solves this by distilling multi-layered code into precise, high-signal summaries—ensuring that language models receive only the most relevant, structured context at every step. This enables deep reasoning, accurate generation, and high-quality reviews without hitting context limits or losing essential detail.</span></p>
<h3 id="execution-planning">Execution Planning</h3>
<p>Qodo’s default plan-first approach ensures that implementation begins only after a structured breakdown of user intent. Instead of rushing into action, we first deeply analyze the user’s goal, then decompose it into clear, actionable subtasks arranged for optimal execution. This creates a roadmap for the LLM, enabling precise task tracking and reliable validation. Completion is judged not just by output but by strict adherence to the original plan—gaps trigger feedback and retry loops until full alignment is achieved</p>
<h3 id="retry-and-fall-back-mechanisms">Retry and Fall-back Mechanisms</h3>
<p>When a tool call fails, Qodo agents don’t stop—they adapt. The system extracts error feedback, invokes the LLM to diagnose the failure, and intelligently adjusts the tool parameters or structure. Agents are empowered to retry up to three times if needed, refining their calls each round. If resolution isn’t possible through retries, the agent pivots to alternative strategies, ensuring progress continues despite initial breakdowns.</p>
<h3 id="powered-by-langgraph">Powered by LangGraph</h3>
<p>Qodo Command uses LangGraph, a framework for agents and agentic workflows that require structure, modularity and state management, giving Qodo Command modularity and speed. LangGraph enables graph-based orchestration, where each step is a configurable node. This foundation allowed us to reuse and extend proven components from Qodo Gen, our IDE extension—including code analysis, summarization and security scanning—while giving us the flexibility to split, extend and repurpose workflows effortlessly.</p>
<h3 id="agent-tools">Agent Tools</h3>
<p><span>Qodo Command combines agentic reasoning with a powerful set of execution tools. These tools allow Qodo’s agents to operate more like expert developers—interacting with real environments, scanning large codebases, and thinking in structured steps.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>FileSystem: </strong>Standard tools for reading, writing, and editing files and directories. Since even state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs may produce errors when using exact matches with the edit file tool, we have implemented a fallback mechanism that allows fuzzy matching to improve the tool’s success rate.</li>
<li><strong>Shell Tool:</strong> executing like a real developer, Qodo agents can interact with the system shell to run build scripts and linters, execute test suites and validate hypotheses in real-time</li>
<li><b>Ripgrep</b>: for deep codebase understanding, Qodo Command is natively designed for optimized usage of ripgrep recursive search tool to locate relevant code across large repositories</li>
<li><b>Sequential Thinking</b><span>: structured agent reasoning helped contribute to the benchmark results by breaking down tasks into actionable steps. This shows the importance of interacting with ai coding agents in a step-by-step iteration, and how well structured tickets or PRDs can yield better code results. While this tool is not enabled by default, it can be easily added via MCP to any custom agent with Qodo Command.</span></li>
<li><strong>Web Search:</strong> this tool has been disabled for SWE-bench run to prevent data leakage in solutions</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-makes-qodo-command-exceptional-for-complex-codebases-code-quality">What Makes Qodo Command Exceptional for Complex Codebases Code Quality</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.qodo.ai/blog/introducing-qodo-gen-cli-build-run-and-automate-agents-anywhere-in-your-sdlc/"><span>We recently announced Qodo Command</span></a><span> and it’s already transforming how we develop software at Qodo. What makes Qodo Command unique is our foundational focus on automation with integrity. Here’s what you can do with Qodo Command:</span></p>
<h3 id="code-integrity-automations">Code Integrity Automations</h3>
<p>Since launch, the Qodo team, our customers and community contributors have been actively building agents using Qodo Command,enabling teams to automate high-impact tasks such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Code review automation</li>

<li>Documentation generation</li>
</ul>
<p>And many more agents that enhance code quality, which&nbsp; you can explore in Qodo Command <a href="https://github.com/qodo-ai/agents">agents</a> repository.</p>
<h3 id="ui-mode-for-reviewing-code">UI Mode for Reviewing Code</h3>
<p>Code quality doesn’t stop at generation—it depends on consistent, structured review. That’s why Qodo Command includes a dedicated UI mode with Qodo Merge, our advanced code review agent, built in.</p>
<p>This integration enables developers to generate and review code in a single, streamlined flow. Every AI-assisted task is automatically routed through a review process that checks for correctness, completeness, and quality—helping teams ship faster without lowering standards.</p>
<h2 id="what-will-you-build-next">What will you build next?</h2>
<p>Qodo Command isn’t built for benchmarks – it’s built for your production environment. The same version that ranked in the global top 5 on SWE-bench Verified is available today with a single command:</p>
<p><code>npm install -g @qodo/command</code></p>
<p>Use it to automate your code integrity workflows, accelerate code reviews, and generate tests, docs, and feature code—all while maintaining the quality standards your team depends on. It’s the CLI agent we’ve built for ourselves and continue to improve weekly, in the open. And we’re just getting started.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-pjax="true" data-test-selector="body-content" data-view-component="true"><h2><g-emoji alias="warning">⚠️</g-emoji> First 2.0 release <g-emoji alias="warning">⚠️</g-emoji></h2>
<p>This is the first release of the new 2.0 series. Expect some rough edges and keep a sense of adventure! 🙏</p>
<h2>Major changes in 2.0</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Database backend switched from LevelDB to SQLite. There is a migration on<br>
first launch which can be lengthy for larger setups. The new database is<br>
easier to understand and maintain and, hopefully, less buggy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The logging format has changed to use structured log entries (a message<br>
plus several key-value pairs). Additionally, we can now control the log<br>
level per package, and a new log level WARNING has been inserted between<br>
INFO and ERROR (which was previously known as WARNING...). The INFO level<br>
has become more verbose, indicating the sync actions taken by Syncthing. A<br>
new command line flag <code>--log-level</code> sets the default log level for all<br>
packages, and the <code>STTRACE</code> environment variable and GUI has been updated<br>
to set log levels per package. The <code>--verbose</code> and <code>--logflags</code> command<br>
line options have been removed and will be ignored if given.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deleted items are no longer kept forever in the database, instead they are<br>
forgotten after six months. If your use case require deletes to take<br>
effect after more than a six month delay, set the<br>
<code>--db-delete-retention-interval</code> command line option or corresponding<br>
environment variable to zero, or a longer time interval of your choosing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Modernised command line options parsing. Old single-dash long options are<br>
no longer supported, e.g. <code>-home</code> must be given as <code>--home</code>. Some options<br>
have been renamed, others have become subcommands. All serve options are<br>
now also accepted as environment variables. See  <code>syncthing --help</code> and<br>
<code>syncthing serve --help</code> for details.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rolling hash detection of shifted data is no longer supported as this<br>
effectively never helped. Instead, scanning and syncing is faster and more<br>
efficient without it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A "default folder" is no longer created on first startup.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Multiple connections are now used by default between v2 devices. The new<br>
default value is to use three connections: one for index metadata and two<br>
for data exchange.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The following platforms unfortunately no longer get prebuilt binaries for<br>
download at syncthing.net and on GitHub, due to complexities related to<br>
cross compilation with SQLite:</p>
<ul>
<li>dragonfly/amd64</li>
<li>illumos/amd64 and solaris/amd64</li>
<li>linux/ppc64</li>
<li>netbsd/*</li>
<li>openbsd/386 and openbsd/arm</li>
<li>windows/arm</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The handling of conflict resolution involving deleted files has changed. A<br>
delete can now be the winning outcome of conflict resolution, resulting in<br>
the deleted file being moved to a conflict copy.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This release is also available as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>APT repository: <a href="https://apt.syncthing.net/" rel="nofollow">https://apt.syncthing.net/</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Docker image: <code>docker.io/syncthing/syncthing:2.0.0</code> or <code>ghcr.io/syncthing/syncthing:2.0.0</code><br>
(<code>{docker,ghcr}.io/syncthing/syncthing:2</code> to follow just the major version)</p>
</li>
</ul>

          <p>In recent months, the AI industry has started <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/04/openai-releases-new-simulated-reasoning-models-with-full-tool-access/">moving toward</a> so-called <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/china-is-catching-up-with-americas-best-reasoning-ai-models/">simulated reasoning models</a> that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/02/claude-3-7-sonnet-debuts-with-extended-thinking-to-tackle-complex-problems/">use a "chain of thought" process</a> to work through tricky problems in multiple logical steps. At the same time, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/06/new-apple-study-challenges-whether-ai-models-truly-reason-through-problems/">recent</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/04/new-study-shows-why-simulated-reasoning-ai-models-dont-yet-live-up-to-their-billing/">research</a> has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/04/researchers-concerned-to-find-ai-models-hiding-their-true-reasoning-processes/">cast doubt</a> on whether those models <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/06/with-the-launch-of-o3-pro-lets-talk-about-what-ai-reasoning-actually-does/">have even a basic understanding of general logical concepts</a> or an accurate grasp of their own "thought process." Similar research shows that these "reasoning" models can often produce incoherent, logically unsound answers when questions include irrelevant clauses or deviate even slightly from common templates found in their training data.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01191">a recent pre-print paper</a>, researchers from the University of Arizona summarize this existing work as "suggest[ing] that LLMs are not principled reasoners but rather sophisticated simulators of reasoning-like text." To pull on that thread, the researchers created a carefully controlled LLM environment in an attempt to measure just how well chain-of-thought reasoning works when presented with "out of domain" logical problems that don't match the specific logical patterns found in their training data.</p>
<p>The results suggest that the seemingly large performance leaps made by chain-of-thought models are "largely a brittle mirage" that "become[s] fragile and prone to failure even under moderate distribution shifts," the researchers write. "Rather than demonstrating a true understanding of text, CoT reasoning under task transformations appears to reflect a replication of patterns learned during training."</p>
<h2>No one trained me for this!</h2>
<p>To test an LLM's generalized reasoning capability in an objective, measurable way, the researchers created a specially controlled LLM training environment <a href="https://github.com/ChengshuaiZhao0/DataAlchemy">called DataAlchemy</a>. This setup creates small models trained on examples of two extremely simple text transformations—an <a href="https://www.dcode.fr/rot-cipher">ROT cypher</a> and <a href="https://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings-article/icee/2010/3997d483/12OmNvo67DA">cyclical shifts</a>—followed by additional training that demonstrates those two functions performed in various orders and combinations.</p>

<p>These simplified models were then tested using a variety of tasks, some of which precisely or closely matched the function patterns in the training data and others that required function compositions that were either partially or fully "out of domain" for the training data. For instance, a model trained on data showing two cyclical shifts might be asked to perform a novel transformation involving two ROT shifts (with basic training on what a single example of either shift looks like). The final answers and reasoning steps were compared to the desired answer using <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/evaluate-metric/bleu">BLEU scores</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance">Levenshtein Distance</a> for an objective measure of their accuracy.</p>
<p>As the researchers hypothesized, these basic models started to fail catastrophically when asked to generalize novel sets of transformations that were not directly demonstrated in the training data. While the models would often try to generalize new logical rules based on similar patterns in the training data, this would quite often lead to the model laying out "correct reasoning paths, yet incorrect answer[s]." In other cases, the LLM would sometimes stumble onto correct answers paired with "unfaithful reasoning paths" that didn't follow logically.</p>

<p>The researchers went on to test their controlled system using input text strings slightly shorter or longer than those found in the training data, or that required function chains of different lengths than those it was trained on. In both cases the accuracy of the results "deteriorates as the [length] discrepancy increases," thus "indicating the failure of generalization" in the models. Small, unfamiliar-to-the-model discrepancies in the format of the test tasks (e.g., the introduction of letters or symbols not found in the training data) also caused performance to "degrade sharply" and "affect[ed] the correctness" of the model's responses, the researchers found.</p>

<h2>“A false aura of dependability”</h2>
<p>Using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to introduce even a small amount of relevant data to the training set can often lead to strong improvements in this kind of "out of domain" model performance. But the researchers say that this kind of "patch" for various logical tasks "should not be mistaken for achieving true generalization. ... Relying on SFT to fix every [out of domain] failure is an unsustainable and reactive strategy that fails to address the core issue: the model’s lack of abstract reasoning capability."</p>
<p>Rather than showing the capability for generalized logical inference, these chain-of-thought models are "a sophisticated form of structured pattern matching" that "degrades significantly" when pushed even slightly outside of its training distribution, the researchers write. Further, the ability of these models to generate "fluent nonsense" creates "a false aura of dependability" that does not stand up to a careful audit.</p>
<p>As such, the researchers warn heavily against "equating [chain-of-thought]-style output with human thinking" especially in "high-stakes domains like medicine, finance, or legal analysis." Current tests and benchmarks should prioritize tasks that fall outside of any training set to probe for these kinds of errors, while future models will need to move beyond "surface-level pattern recognition to exhibit deeper inferential competence," they write.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/1032732/3334850da49689e1/">https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/1032732/3334850da49689e1/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44872313">Hacker News</a></p>

<p>
<a href="https://stardict-4.sourceforge.net/index_en.php">StarDict</a> is a
GPLv3-licensed cross-platform dictionary application. It includes dictionaries
for a number of languages, and has a rich plugin ecosystem. It also has a
glaring security problem: while running on X11, using Debian's default configuration,
it will send a user's text selections over unencrypted HTTP to two remote servers.
</p>

<p>
On August&nbsp;4, Vincent Lefevre
<a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/20250804092217.GA962280@qaa.vinc17.org/">
reported</a> the problem to the oss-security mailing list and to
<a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1110370">
Debian's bug tracker</a>.
He identified it while testing his setup before the
upcoming Debian&nbsp;13 ("trixie") release.
Installing StarDict will also
install the <tt>stardict-plugin</tt> package by default, because the former
recommends the latter. The plugins package contains a set of commonly used
StarDict plugins, including a plugin for
<a href="https://www.youdao.com/">
YouDao</a>, a Chinese search engine that supplies Chinese-to-English
translations. The plugin also contacts a second online Chinese dictionary,
<a href="https://dict.cn/">
dict.cn</a>.
</p>

<p>
This would normally not be much cause for concern; of course a dictionary
program will include code to talk to dictionary-providing web sites. But one of
StarDict's features, which is also enabled by default, is its "scan"
functionality: it will watch the user's text selections (i.e. text highlighted
with the mouse), and automatically
provide translations as a pop-up. Taken together, the two features result in any
selected text being sent to both servers. This only occurs while StarDict is
open, but the application is designed to be left open in the background in case
the user needs a quick reference while reading.
</p>

<blockquote>
The staff here at LWN.net really appreciate the subscribers who make
our work possible. Is there a chance we could interest you in <a href="https://lwn.net/Promo/daroc2/claim">becoming one of them</a>?
</blockquote>
<p>
StarDict on Wayland doesn't have this problem, because Wayland
prevents applications from being
able to capture text from other applications by default. That does mean that it
breaks StarDict's scan feature, though.
</p>

<p>
Xiao Sheng Wen, the Debian package maintainer for StarDict,
<a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1110370#10">
didn't see a problem</a> with the behavior, noting that if a user doesn't want
to use the scan functionality or the YouDao plugin, both can be disabled.
Lefevre
<a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1110370#29">
wasn't satisfied</a> with that, saying:
</p>

<blockquote>
But this is not the whole point. Features with privacy concerns
should never be enabled by default (unless the feature is the
only purpose of the package, and such a package would never be
installed automatically — and even in such a case, there should
be a big warning first).
</blockquote>

<p>
In response, Xiao
<a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1110370#34">
pointed out</a> that
<a href="https://packages.debian.org/trixie/stardict-gtk">
the package description</a> can be read by any
user who chooses to install the software, and it does mention the scan feature.
That said, I noted during my investigation that the
<a href="https://packages.debian.org/trixie/stardict-plugin">
description</a> of <tt>stardict-plugin</tt> did
not mention that the YouDao plugin uses an online service instead of an offline
dictionary. Xiao suggested splitting the networked dictionary plugins into a
separate package, but was "<q>not sure whether it's very necessary to do so</q>".
</p>

<p>
It is worth noting that the scan feature, while obviously a problem in this
context, is one of the reasons that a user might choose to use StarDict over an
alternative. Reading foreign-language media is often easier when words can be
sought in a dictionary with as little fuss as possible. From that perspective,
it makes sense that Xiao might not view the feature as problematic.
</p>

<p>
Any user who did read the description of the package, and who knew what the
YouDao plugin would do, might nevertheless expect the resulting communication to
at least be encrypted. But the plugin actually reaches out to its backend
servers — dict.youdao.com and dict.cn — over unsecured HTTP. So, not only are
these servers sent any text the user selects, but anyone who can view traffic
anywhere along its path can see the same thing.
</p>

<p>
This is not even the first time that StarDict has sent user selections to the
internet; the
same kind of problem
<a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=534731">was
reported</a> by Pavel Machek in 2009 and
<a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=806960#5">again</a>
by "niekt0" in 2015. The 2009 bug was solved by patching
the application's default configuration to disable networked dictionaries. That
appears to have worked for a time, but the YouDao plugin, which was added in
2016, does not respect the
configuration option. The 2015 problem was not fixed
<a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=806960#57">until
August 6 of this year</a> (although the package was removed from Debian for
unrelated reasons for a few months from 2020 to 2021). That fix just removed the
<tt>stardict_dictdotcn.so</tt> plugin, which also sent translation requests to
dict.cn and was later subsumed by the YouDao plugin,
from the package. In fairness to Xiao, he
was not the
StarDict maintainer in 2015 —
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150912065912/https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/stardict">
that was</a> Andrew Lee — but Xiao
<a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=806960#28">knew</a>
about the 2015 bug since at least 2021, even if he didn't consider it a priority.
</p>

<p>
According to Debian's
<a href="https://qa.debian.org/popcon.php?package=stardict">package popularity
contest statistics</a>,
only 178 people have
StarDict installed, down from around a thousand between 2009 and 2015.
That obviously doesn't capture people who have configured
their Debian system not to participate in the statistics collection, but it does
suggest there were a number of people who might have been broadcasting their text
selections to the internet for several years. Given that people copy and
paste passwords from their password managers, or select the text of sensitive
emails and documents during the course of editing, that should be a significant cause
for concern.
</p>

<p>
Debian is a large distribution, containing tens of thousands of packages.
Moreover, because of its commitment to stability, a decent fraction of these
are older software with delayed or sporadic updates. The reality is that Linus's
law ("<q>given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow</q>") only holds up if
people are looking — and if, once they have looked, and have reported things,
the people who have taken up maintenance of the software actually agree that
there is a problem.
</p>

<p>
Part of the justification for moving to Wayland over X11 is to make security
vulnerabilities relating to one application spying on another more difficult to
introduce. That obviously has to be balanced against the
cost of adapting to a new way of doing things, but it's not hard to see why so
many people are eager to make Wayland work. Maybe, in the future, StarDict's
default behavior would
have had little to no impact. Or maybe StarDict would have started asking for
special permissions to let it work on Wayland, and users would have accepted
those defaults the same way they currently do.
</p>

<p>
Either way, the existence of serious security problems that can be
found, diagnosed, reported, and still remain unfixed is cause for concern. Linux
has long enjoyed a reputation for security; maintaining that reputation depends
on the developers, maintainers, and users of open-source software caring enough
to fix security problems when they arise.

<p>This is a blog post based on a transcript of a talk by Devine on November 26th 2022. Watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TJuOwy4aGA" target="_blank">video version</a> on (YouTube). The slideshow presentation was made using <a href="https://100r.co/site/adelie.html">Adelie</a>.</p>

<p>Thank you to Matt Mascarenhas for providing us with an auto-transcript, it would have taken us ages to put this text together without it.</p>

<p>While we are grateful to have had the opportunity to give this presentation, an event in 2025 has resulted in us distancing ourselves from the conference responsible for hosting this talk. Below is a text by Devine explaining the situation.</p>

<details>
    <summary>Click to expand</summary>
 		<p><b>February 2025.</b><i> Some months ago, attendees of the Handmade Seattle conference expressed their grievances with the November 2024 conference in regards to its pivoting to include talks with mentions of social justice awareness and a slightly more diverse panel of speakers, at the cost of the usual guy-packs-bytes-in-the-right-sequence talks. Which I have nothing against as someone who tend to give talks of that exact flavor.<br>
		In any case, the conference organizer apologized for the poor selection of speakers which did not correspond to the expectations of ticket holders, promising to resolve the issue in the following year, and in passing, that free and open source software developers would no longer be welcomed as speakers.<br>
		I happened to be present in the chatroom when the apology letter went out and merely questioned whether the choice was really about the lack of low-level talks, and not something else. It did not take long for bigots of all sorts to come out and lament the good old days of the conference and soon the chatroom was ablaze with some pretty vile things against trans people, this went on for hours without intervention, the usual.<br>
		What I did not expect was for the conference organizer, who ghosted me for months, to finally break radio silence to slam me for speaking out and partially blaming me for the unraveling of the conference organization, and decided against covering the agreed upon travel stipend. I have since requested for the talk videos to be removed from their YouTube channel, Vimeo, and their website.</i><br>Reposted from <a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/now.html" target="_blank">xxiivv.com</a></p>

<h2>Weathering Software Winter</h2>

<p>I work with a little studio called Hundred Rabbits, it is a small collective of two which operates from a small solar-powered sailboat. All of our devices are donated, discarded devices. Our <a href="https://100r.co/site/philosophy.html">philosophy</a> is that to make fast software, you need slow computers, and we've tried to espouse this as much as we could. We spend our time sailing around, and doing experiments with resilience, that covers computers, but we also touch on food security, preservation, and on studying past technologies that could be used today in times of crisis.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_04.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>We started sailing seven years ago, it took us all around the Pacific. We went through <a href="https://100r.co/site/mexico.html">Mexico</a>, <a href="https://100r.co/site/french_polynesia.html">French Polynesia</a>, <a href="https://100r.co/site/new_zealand.html">New Zealand</a>, up through <a href="https://100r.co/site/fiji.html">Fiji</a>, <a href="https://100r.co/site/japan.html">Japan</a>, and then followed the Russian Coast, brushing by Alaska before returning to <a href="https://100r.co/site/western_canada.html">Western Canada</a>. Our thinking was that we could keep doing art, music, and video games as we sailed around, but it soon became obvious that all the technology that we took for granted, and that we had with us, was not designed to leave the Western world.</p>

<p>The moment we cast off from Mexico, all of our devices started breaking down. In his 2022 Handmade Seattle opening speech, Abner was making a point about the Roombas starting to fail. If your Roomba fails, you pick up a broom, but on a sailboat you depend on devices working to find your position, knowing the weather, etc. These things have a more direct impact on your survival, and all of that technology is built on the same stack as the Roomba.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_05.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>Many of the tools that we thought we could rely on broke down, whether it is Apple products, or software that require subscription services, <abbr title="Digital Rights Management">DRM</abbr>, etc. As an artist you spend time developping a skill, you become a Photoshop illustrator. When your connection to the internet fails and that the software locks up, that skill that you thought was yours was actually entirely owned by someone, and can be taken away.</p>

<p>Even though we've been paying for this sort of software for years, the moment that you can't have access to authenticate yourself that skill is gone. We didn't expect this, it scared us.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_06.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>Nowadays, everything is built on the cloud. While sailing along the US coast in early 2016, we'd stop by conferences to see all the happenings in tech. We would speak with people at the booths, and they would try and sell us their product, but we'd have to stop them mid-sentence to ask, "Does it work offline?" 99% of times people say, "ah, yeah no, sorry. It's on the cloud."</p><p>It seemed that no one was building things that we could use. This was a sad realization. I love programming, and for a time it seemed that it was utterly incompatible with our new way of life.</p>

<p>Before I go on any further, I will paint you a picture of what it looks like to try to use modern stacks when away from the shores of the Western world.</p>

<p>Imagine two people in a small sailboat in the tropics, somewhere like the Marquesas, or another island in the South Pacific Ocean. These islands are covered with beautiful lush forests, they require rain and sun, that's all, then there's us sharing that same space, busy lifting a smartphone in a Ziploc bag up the mast to try and get one bar of signal to update Xcode, which at the time was 11 gigs. We had a stack of cards, each worth two gigabytes of mobile data, but with Xcode you can't resume the download if it fails. We could swap the codes for the cards, and if we did it within 10 seconds it would detect a timeout and would continue. The problem is that if the download is not done by 1600, then the sun is setting, the solar panels aren't charging the batteries anymore, and our laptops are dying. The download is at 7 gigs with three more hours left to download the update, it won't finish, and we will have spent all that data for nothing.</p>

<p>This wasn't ideal. We tried to look for alternatives...</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> In 2016, we were publishing games for iOS, we used Xcode, as well as iPhones, and Macbook Pros. Rek used Photoshop to draw, having never been exposed to tools like Krita, and Gimp. We knew of Linux back then, but not well enough to consider it. As artists, we didn't think Linux could work for us (evidently, we were wrong). We'd always lived in cities, close to an internet connection. Updating Xcode on a fast and stable home connection was never a problem, we never looked at the size of any download because we didn't have to care. On land, we had seemingly infinite power, and we had bandwidth. When resources are scarce, then we had to start focusing on details like download size, and how much sun the day will bring. We were so focused on sailing that first year, that we didn't stop to think if it made sense to do iOS development while traveling. When we left Canada we were a bit naive, but we didn't know what we didn't know. Now, in 2023, Rek draws mainly by hand, and processes drawings with Gimp. Both of us use linux(Manjaro), and we don't own a smart phone. See <a href="https://100r.co/site/tools_ecosystem.html">tools ecosystem</a> for further details on our shaky beginnings.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_07.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>We noticed that all the software that we had written in the past was gradually becoming unusable. We grew up in Montreal, and many of our friends worked in <abbr title="Triple-A">AAA</abbr> studios like Ubisoft, making free-to-play games, building projects that had a lifespan of three years. The projects that we made in the past on the Apple stack, Electron, or on Unity3D, also had a lifespan of three to four years, but games like Super Mario, as well as others produced in that era, are still playable today. We are in a dark age, where game developers and artists spend years building games that quickly become lost <a href="http://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/stack.html" target="_blank">bitrot</a>. We'll never be able to play Scott Pilgrim on the PlayStation again.</p>

<p>Looking online, it seemed that others shared these concerns.</p> 

<p>In the above image are four philosophies of digital data preservation, they all have their flaws. Data preservation is a somewhat new field, we don't know what sort of data we'll be able to recover in a hundred years, but from the experiments that we've looked at, it doesn't look good. The <abbr title="The British Broadcasting Corporation">BBC</abbr> had a project where they were trying to mimic one of their longest lasting books, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domesday_Book" target="_blank">Domesday book</a>. It was written by monks a few hundred years ago. The <abbr title="The British Broadcasting Corporation">BBC</abbr>'s thinking was that we still have this book today, we can still read it, do we have technology to make something like this? Is it possible to record our way of life today, so that people in a thousand years can see how we lived? They created the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Domesday_Project" target="_blank">BBC Domesday</a>, a disc that contained music, movies, and scientific papers. Then 10 years later, it was an unreadable, people forgot how to decrypt and decompile the disc. It seemed that there was no real way to preserve data long-term, and so we decided to try our own little experiment.</p>

<p>As a disclaimer, all that I am writing now is very naive. I draw, and I make music, when I started doing research I didn't have the vocabulary to find what I was looking for. I didn't know what virtual machines were, I didn't know what compilers were either. I had a vague idea of what programming was. I had written Swift and Objective C, but had no conception of how it actually tied to processors. It seemed like I was learning a service, the same way I was learning "To Photoshop". It wasn't like learning a skill, you don't learn to draw when you use Photoshop, you learn how to operate within the confines of someone else's playground, and when that rug is pulled from underneath you, there's nothing you can say or do, and you never really understood how it worked in the first place so you can't really replicate it.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_08.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>We eventually stumbled on the words <b>virtual machine</b>. With a Super Mario brother <abbr title="Nintendo Entertainment System">NES</abbr> file, I knew I could put it on a computer and I could run it, I could run it on my phone, I could run it on an old computer, I could run it on a Super Nintendo, I could also run a Super Nintendo emulator running Mario on a Nintendo 64. This seemed a good way of preserving data. We decided to not give up entirely on software, and to see what could be done in that space using virtual machines.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_09.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>Hardware is extremely cheap, and because it is it's covering the world with e-waste, and all of it is there for the taking. Everyone has drawers full of old devices, Super Nintendos, Playstations, Dreamcasts, all of which are considered obsolete, people stopped developing games for them, but we thought we could give a second life to such devices. When looking into how this could be done, it led us to interesting places. We became interested in seeing how we could repurpose old electronics. There didn't seem to be any competition. If you do like everyone else, you're competing with everyone else. For example, if making iOS 10 software the marketplace is completely saturated, but if you're going be release an Atari game today, it's going to be huge. There's no one giving purpose to these devices anymore. We tried to do something completely left field. To start, our goal was to try and make games for the NintendoDS.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_10.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>So looking at a VM from the outside, without having a sort of academic background, the first thing you find is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine" target="_blank">JVM</a>. I've never written any Java, but I would go around and tell my friends who are actual programmers, "I'm gonna make the <abbr title="Java Virtual Machine">JVM</abbr>! It seems like this would solve our problem!" Their response was that the JVM was so fractalized, and that this wasn't what we were looking for. We found plenty of academic papers with no software written for them.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_11.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>I dabbled into the Java ecosystem, and I couldn't make heads or tails of it</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_12.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>I knew that we wanted to make playful little projects that could run on a variety of devices, on a sort of cross platform that was not Electron. Instead of always targeting the new modern thing, we thought we could make a <abbr title="Virtual Machine">VM</abbr>, or something other, that could run increasingly further back into the past.</p>

<p>There is an incredible amount of fast computers out there. The first time <a href="https://100r.co/site/donsol.html">I made an NES game</a>, I was surprised at how much stuff I could draw on the screen at 60 fps. I had somehow been convinced that modern technology was better, faster, and all the eight bit stuff had been solved problems, I thought that we had explored this problem space entirely.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_13.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>It didn't seem to be the case. There were a lot of ideas in the past that were forgotten, and I made it my mission to explore this. It was <abbr title="Coronavirus Disease 2019 (SARS-2)">COVID</abbr>, everyone was confined to their homes, it was the perfect time to figure out how computers work. We're going to look into the past to see how people did it, and what ideas were forgotten.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_14.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>There was a time when computers were super playful, but now they feel cold, and have been weaponized against people. The sort of playfulness that you'd find in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Bob" target="_blank">Microsoft Bob</a>, I can't really find a parallel for today. I can imagine what Microsoft Bob would look like if made today, it would try to sell you all sorts of shit. I don't think we, as a society, have a system in place that would foster the creation of something as playful as this.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_15.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>A realization that I had working on something like this was that customizing your hardware, and your software, makes you care.</p>

<p>If you buy something off the shelf, like an iPhone, which you can't change, you're less likely to care for it, and it's going to end up in a drawer. Back then you could go to Radio Shack and get parts for your computer, it was possible to customize it (for example, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altair_8800" target="_blank">Altair</a>), and then you could know it in its entirety. Devices that were customized, or built from near-scratch, are still loved, but as for your old iPhone6, you don't know where it is, and even if you did it's probably unusable. Devices like the iPhone6 can't be repaired, they are designed to fail in ways that are inscrutable.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_16.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>Instead of trying to make things as broadly accessible as possible, we thought we'd try to see what we could do if we designed it for just one person, a sort of personal computing that was not designed to scale.</p><p>I can see the appeal of languages like Rust, I won't be learning it, but if you're convinced that you can use computers to solve problems, then obviously this will not be relevant to you. I think that if you are forced to use a computer, there is no way that it can be playful. There was a writer who said, "if you're forced to play, you can't play."</p>

<p>I don't have a smartphone. Walking in Seattle I saw the streets lined with lime scooters everywhere, to see the menu to be allowed to use a scooter you need to scan a QR code. There's a layer of reality that's being forced onto people to use technology.</p>

<p>This is not what I'm talking about here. What we're trying to do is something that is closer to your personal computer, something that would be designed and tailored to help you play.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_17.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>When we began looking at what VMs there were, we looked into the past, and that brought us to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk" target="_blank">Smalltalk</a>. I read this book called What the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_the_Dormouse_Said" target="_blank">Dormouse Said</a>, and it talked about the history of Stanford, and how people had this utopian idea of what computers could be. This is way before I even became interested in computers, learning what their vision was then made me optimistic about what could be done.</p>

<p>That was when I was first exposed to the idea of a virtual machine, or byte code. As I mentioned before, looking up information online without the vocabulary you need to find things is really difficult. There was no way I could go around learning about personal computing without spending some time learning Smalltalk.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_18.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>Obviously, the moment that you start going that down that route, you will have people telling you that you really have to try <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_machine" target="_blank">Lisp machines</a>. I spent time learning about Symbolics and LVP. I learned about a sort of system where the whole thing could be inspected, a system that was trying to do computing in a very personal way.</p>

<p>Nowadays, it's akin to the browser, where you can go on a website that you like, and right click to inspect. It is less and less the case now, but for a while you could inspect websites to see how it was put together. This was empowering, emblematic of the era.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_19.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>This doesn't work on a <abbr title="Virtual Machine">VM</abbr> at all, but it's relevant because <b>Niklaus Wirth</b>, who wrote <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oberon_(operating_system)" target="_blank">Oberon</a>, wrote an entire operating system that came with a book.</p>

<p>The Oberon book is really nice, especially if you come into it with a clear mind, without prior knowledge or expectation of what programming is. The book explains how to build an operating system from scratch. It uses a language like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language)" target="_blank">Pascal</a>, which is very easy to read, more beautiful than other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALGOL" target="_blank">ALGOL languages</a>. One of the first things that it teaches you to do is how to draw pictures, which I thought was kind of interesting as someone who's very visually-inclined.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_20.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>In the book Niklaus Wirth mentions the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-code_machine" target="_blank">P-machine</a>. I was beginning to form an idea of what virtual machines were, and he just briefly mentions it, "oh! By the way, I wrote this Pascal compiler targeting a virtual machine." I was like, "a language can target a virtual machine?! What?" And the reason why it was so easy for him to port the compiler between platforms, is that the opcodes running it were extremely simple, and very few in number.</p>

<p>I thought then, <b>this</b> is a way to do data preservation that is appealing to me.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_21.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>I learned Pascal.</p>

<p>Pascal is a beautiful language. In the above image, I am running it in an emulator for the Macintosh. I loved that I could have a whole operating system running in a small window that wasn't Linux, that wasn't some big <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QEMU" target="_blank">QEMU image</a>. It was a little self-contained system, which I could destroy, or start over with really quickly.  I could run it and do 3D at 60 fps by running the emulator at 128 times its speed, and thought that was cool, a testament to how fast computers are nowadays.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_22.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>That led me to learn about the history of C.</p>

<p>I migrated all my platform to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_9_from_Bell_Labs" target="_blank">Plan 9</a>. Plan 9 has its own C compiler, and it's not quite C89, it's its own thing, a no-concessions system.</p>

<p>The people who built this weren't planning to make money with it, you can really tell that it's a product of love. That made me optimistic about what personal computing could be.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_24.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>Plan 9 didn't run on a VM, but it inspired another system. The lessons that they learned during Plan 9 led to the building of something called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferno_(operating_system)" target="_blank">Inferno</a>, which runs on a VM.</p>

<p>I think I was starting to understand what <abbr title="Virtual Machines">VMs</abbr> were. If this entire operating system runs on a vm, this is what I wanna be doing.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_25.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>The scale of something like Inferno is quite big, but in an afternoon I could run through the whole C code for this virtual machine. The above (image) is the opcodes that it had.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_26.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>It was in part inspired from the actual hardware that ran the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Newton" target="_blank">Apple Newton</a>.</p>

<p>I could run it in an afternoon, and know exactly how it ran. I would look at the compiler that targeted the Dis virtual machine, and could see how they reduced the problem-space to a limited number of operations.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_27.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>The people who worked really hard in the past to get away from time-sharing system would laugh, or they would cry, at how we got tricked into falling back in that situation where computers were something that was done behind a wall. You have a terminal, but that's where your power ends.</p><p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_28.jpg" loading="lazy">

</p><p>I wanted a way of doing computers that nobody could take away from me.</p>

<p>I would read people who would write entire operating system on a weekend, but I couldn't even map this idea onto things I was seeing, a bridge was missing.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_29.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>The modern stack doesn't really work for us, it doesn't apply to the limitations that we have on the boat. We have 180 watts of solar. We just spent the whole summer with two 6-volt batteries, which is very small. When you're going down that route, at every turn people are telling to just put more solar panels, or to buy more batteries. That is such a modern way of solving your problem. In reality, technology like this(especially high-tech) rarely solves problems. It creates a lot of other problems, which on a sailboat is very immediate. Putting more solar would mean more windage, more chance of things flying off and cutting our limbs. More batteries would mean the boat would be heavier, it would stop us from being able to run away from storms.</p>

<p>The limits of a sailboat gives us a space for creativity, and these limitations became a sort of playground for us.</p>

<p>I am not the sort of programmer who could build Plan 9, or Oberon, or Lisp machines, but I knew I could write simple NES games and port them. I couldn't write an <abbr title="Nintendo Entertainment System">NES</abbr> game inside an <abbr title="Nintendo Entertainment System">NES</abbr> game, and that was such a shame. I wanted something that was completely bootstrapped.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_30.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p> So after looking at 6502, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64" target="_blank">Commodore 64</a> emulator was extremely complex, more complex than I could grasp. It was the limit of what I think a single person could understand. It seemed like a simple system, it was just a box, but writing an emulator for it was more than a weekend project. I was looking for something that I could nail in a single weekend.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_31.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>6502 has a lot of mnemonics. When trying to implement the 6502 as a <abbr title="Virtual Machine">VM</abbr>, it is possible to make a naive implementation in a week, or in a weekend if you don't do anything else. My knowledge of C is very limited, but luckily I had help. I wondered if this instruction set could be reduced further...</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_32.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>It got me thinking about complexity, and on what simplicity means. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrey_Kolmogorov" target="_blank">Kolmogorov</a>, the mathematician, said that the index of complexity of any one system is the length of the program that could generate a specific string. I really like that way of looking at complexity and simplicity, because nowadays it's sort of convoluted. If you don't really know about hardware, it seems that everyone's trying to make the programmer comfortable, and not focusing on making an actual fast product.</p>

<p>Most of the people I know who are hobbyist programmers use type systems, memory safety, all sorts of <i>training wheels</i>(I'm kidding here, if you're a large team, please do use type systems for god's sake). When I work on my own, I want to reduce the problem space to as little a thing as I can make it. I don't like programming that much, and in the future I'm gonna hate it probably even more, so I want my future self to be able to reimplement my entire system at most in a weekend.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_33.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>So where does that bring me? 6502 is beyond the scope of what I was hoping to do, because having done it twice already, I don't think I'll have it in me to do it again.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_34.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>Looking back at that same era with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Labs" target="_blank">Bell Labs</a>, this was a time when people would build paper computers to teach kids to understand what a program counter was, how things moved around in the program, and how to navigate byte code.</p>

<p>No one can take a paper computer away from you. As long as you have paper and pen you can still solve problems, albeit slowly, and more painfully, but this is a form of computing that can be easily ported.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_35.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>When I was looking at the <abbr title="The British Broadcasting Corporation">BBC</abbr>'s Domesday book, I noticed that Alan Kay(Small Talk) also had a project that was in line with what I was trying to do. He thought, "Smalltalk is a vm, how much of a small VM can possibly run smalltalk-72."</p>

<p>He wrote a paper called <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2814228.2814250" target="_blank">The Cuneiform Tablets of 2015</a>, he had all these words to talk about computers that went viral. He said things like, "Lisp was the Maxwell equation of programming." As a minimalist geek I was glad to hear this, it's what I wanted, but then looking into Lisp, I thought that a language that creates garbage by design wasn't really what I was looking for. This was a bit more like it, but it was a register machine, and I didn't see how that mapped to Smalltalk.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_36.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>So <a href="https://sr.ht/~bctnry/chifir/" target="_blank">ChifirVM</a> is not exactly what I'm looking for, but there are plenty of other ways of doing computing out there. Instantly, I fell onto one-instruction set computers, like <a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/subleq.html">SUBLEQ</a>. I thought it was a disgusting tar pit, but I could implement it in 15 minutes, and I would be really kind for my future self to make a system that could run on something that I could implement in 15 minutes.</p> 

<p>The problem was that the toolchain required to write things that could actually have any purpose for it was immense. There were people who wrote C compilers down to Subleq, but this shifts the whole complexity back to the compiler, and that doesn't solve my problem. </p>

<p>There were computing paradigms which I absolutely loved, so pure, so beautiful, but at the same time they mapped so poorly to silicone that they didn't really work for me.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_37.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p><a href="http://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/thue.html" target="_blank">Thue</a>(one of my favorites) is an esoteric programming language that has one operator, and only has a replacement rule. So you have an accumulator, which is a series of characters, and every rule, one for every line, is a replacement of what's on the left with what's on the right. It was very slow, but extremely powerful, and could be implemented in 30 minutes.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_38.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p><a href="http://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/fractran.html" target="_blank">FRACTRAN</a> was another <abbr title="One-Instruction Set Computer">OISC</abbr> system. It has one operation: multiply. Its primitives were not bytes, or shorts, but fractions. It used prime encoding, which was one of the most beautiful mathematical concept that I knew of.</p>

<p>For a while I thought I had found my bedrock, I was going to use fractions to make computers. The only issue... is that it maps poorly to silicone.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_39.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p><a href="http://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/logic.html" target="_blank">SKI calculus</a> was beautiful, it has this mathematical elegance to it. I went down that rabbit hole, and I barely emerged back alive.</p>

<p>I recommend everyone to take a Lisp detour, and then learn SKI, to read Smullyan, and to read about others like him who don't care about making products, but really want to explore software in a way that is very creative and artistic. I almost made this my bedrock, except that at the VM layer garbage collection was a bad idea.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_41.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p><a href="http://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/brainfuck.html" target="_blank">Brainfuck</a> has 7 instructions, implementing it would take 45 minutes, maybe an hour.</p>

<p>We are going up the abstraction chain here, and the pattern I was seeing was that the lesser a mnemonic or complexity that you reduced it to, the slower it got. Brainfuck was surprisingly fast, you could run a mandelbrot on a system that was quite small to implement, but that wasn't the sort of programming I wanted to do. It led me to another system...</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_H._Moore" target="_blank">Chuck Moore</a> never came up in my books about Stanford, he must have been some sort of outsider. FPGA is not something I was very quite familiar with, but people were trying experimental computing systems with them. It didn't matter, it was goo, you could shape it in any way you wanted.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_40.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>Someone wrote an <abbr title="Field-Programmable Gate Array">FPGA</abbr> system called <a href="https://excamera.com/files/j1.pdf" target="_blank">J1</a>, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_(programming_language)" target="_blank">Forth system</a>. It had very few opcodes, but had one of the most beautiful mapping of byte code I had ever seen. The Stack Machine primitives were implemented so you could combine them with each other, with weird combinations of bit toggles on a byte you could have really interesting esoteric stack manipulators.</p>

<p>I was smitten.</p>

<p>It's a 16-bit Forth system, the biggest literal you can have in one of those words would be like 35k fixed. The arithmetic was really beautiful, but the whole system's maximum program that it could run was four kilobytes.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_42.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>What I had in mind was slightly <b>more</b> than four kilobytes, but not much more. If I could have a full addressable, 64 would be really nice. I didn't want the complexity of the 6502.</p> 

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_43.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>The <a href="http://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/chip8.html" target="_blank">CHIP-8</a> is an interesting system that has a rich, vibrant community of people who build things for it during game jams.</p>

<p>The spec is quite simple, it fits on maybe two pages of paper, side by side. It feels like the paper computer in ways that I like, but it was not designed to be a general purpose driving <abbr title="Virtual Machine">VM</abbr>. It is meant to be building things in the scale of Pong. The keyboard is like a hex keyboard with just numbers on it. My plan was to build something that could build itself in it, so I'd need a keyboard, a cursor-a weird keyboard for me would not cut it.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_44.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p><a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?MachineForth" target="_blank">Machine Forth</a> was something I stumbled upon after. Chuck Moore wrote Forth, and then he thought it too complicated. I thought, "what do you mean it's complicated? There's like no syntax, no nothing. It's space-divided language. Implementing a Forth system is really fast." Chuck More, being himself, thought that he could do without all this 'cruft'. He reduced even further to Machine Forth which has 32, or 24 opcodes.</p>

<p>I kept seeing Forth over and over again, and couldn't really grasp, or see the beauty in it for a while. If you've just come from Lisp, you have whiplash when you fall into Forth. It has similar beauty. Lisp would be prefix, Forth would be <a href="http://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/notation.html" target="_blank">postfix</a>. Following that mindset you think you could be anyone, or you could do anything, and you chose to be Algol, why?</p>

<p>Going back and forth between Forth and Lisp, I couldn't make up my mind, but I kept seeing people who would fall in love with Forth, but were really bad at selling it. With Lisp it's really hard to find any Lisp code that you can actually copy/paste in a project because everyone's using weird macros, and libraries, and nothing is portable.</p>

<p>Forth had a different problem, everyone I'd talk to would say Forth was the best, and that I should really use it, but then I'd ask them questions like, "how do I calculate the distance between two points?" I walked away from that interaction thinking, well, it seems like a lot of people like Forth, but don't write it. It was hard to find any code at all. I know Forth is not portable, but it was hard to find just actual use-case of Forth that wasn't someone trying to learn Forth by implementing Forth and then moving on back to Rust.</p> 

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_46.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>The way Forth works is really simple, you put stuff on a stack, it hits a token, pulls the item from the stack, etc. It doesn't have precedence rules.</p> 

<p>It seemed like a really good bedrock for the things I wanted to do.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_47.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>Machine Forth was something that was going to be something close to the metal, Forth at its core is something pretty close to Assembly, but I wanted something that mapped exactly to Assembly, something that would be like, 'one token would be one byte, or one short'. </p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_48.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>So after a while I picked a bunch of opcodes, and I'd shown them to my friends, and they were like, "these are bad." They were people I trust. If I'd been on my own, I would have likely given up and not done it, or would be writing JavaScript still. They were extremely patient with me, they understood what I was trying to do. People like Sigrid, Alderwick, and Andrew had infinite patience for my stupid questions, they would tell me, "I wouldn't do it this way, but here's something that you could use to improve your system."</p>

<p>In the end, I ended up with this napkin definition of a system that I kind of liked. My goal throughout this whole process was to make a system that could fit on a t-shirt. I might lose my computer, especially on a sailboat, but I don't want to keep preserving all the documentation.</p>

<p>When I started sailing I was doing a bit of Ruby, when came time to gather all the Ruby documentation that I would need to be self-sufficient, the amount was overwhelming.</p>

<p>Being at sea for 50 days straight (see <a href="https://100r.co/site/busy_doing_nothing.html">busy doing nothing</a>) we don't have access to StackOverflow, our questions remain unanswered, now imagine if the site was gone forever tomorrow. At sea, without internet, if I wanted to look up how to fill a polygon, I couldn't do it, but if I had printed it? There are languages that make this more accessible, and others that make it really hard. Not having a background in C, I found it really difficult to go off sailing without my C documentation, but it is very extensive, and very clunky.</p>

<p>My thinking is that I'm probably going to lose the book at some point in the future, but if my future self had that t-shirt they'd probably be okay. I tried to reduce everything that I could do to fit onto a t-shirt, that's as much as I afforded in bandwidth.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_49.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>If you're familiar with 6502 on the left (above image), it just looks like this vertical series of instructions. The little language I made is quite similar. You can map it one to one, and the resulting size of byte code is pretty much the same.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_50.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>You might be familiar with this sort of Assembly language, reading as a big vertical column of characters, but I wanted to use the beauty of Forth and make a language that would be verbose in ways that it resembled writing a little bit.</p>

<p>Every morning when I wake up, and I open my programs, I don't hate myself for not leaving comments because the code itself is a bit more readable and self-documenting.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_51.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>The first thing I tried to do was to make an assembler in that language. It was easy. The language is so simple that the assembler itself is also going to be simple. I generated a X86 application of the <abbr title="Virtual Machine">VM</abbr> that could run its own assembler in that language.</p>

<p>The assembler is <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/drifblim/" target="_blank">3000 bytes</a>.</p> 

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_52.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>It's nothing like a computer, but it will run bytecode. I felt like I had reduced the problems that I was solving with computers down to 32 things, and these 32 things I could probably implement in Fractran and Subleq, other more minimal computing systems.</p>

<p>It taught me about how the little functions you would use in JavaScript to convert a string into an end, you write it in Assembly, and it dispels the magic. Sometimes people say they love magic, but in truth they don't. I don't like magic at all, especially not when things start to break.</p>
 
<p>Douglas Adams said that, "The major difference between a thing that might go wrong and a thing that cannot possibly go wrong is that when a thing that cannot possibly go wrong goes wrong it usually turns out to be impossible to get at and repair." This is the situation I was in with programming. I wanted to understand the whole thing, and to have it be inspectable.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_53.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>From there I started to build dawing routines, etc. I started to make implementations of Basic, of games, or of other emulators.</p>

<p>I have been writing in this little language for two years.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://guide.handmade-seattle.com/c/2022/behind-crafting-interpreters/" target="_blank">sit-down talk</a> <a href="https://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/" target="_blank">Robert Nystrom</a> was encouraging everyone to make their own programming language and their own system. Many of the conference attendees share this view, but in other circles it is generally frowned upon. The first time I mentioned it to anyone I was laughed out the room. I liked to draw, and people were thinking, "what do you even know about computers?"</p> 

<p>I would love to see everyone's programming language, to meet someone new and to ask them: "show me how many opcodes you have."</p>

<p>It is telling about a person's mind.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_55.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>We built this little system that is tailored to host the games we make. It'll be alien to anyone else, and that's okay, we are not trying to sell you on this idea, what we want is for everyone to try and make their own personal computer instead of piggybacking on someone else's idea that's cluttered with artifacts. I don't think we've even begun to scratch the surface of what can be done with this.</p>

<p>A lot of people will try to tell you that we've tried everything with 8-bit, but by the time the <abbr title="Nintendo Entertainment System">NES</abbr> was out, most of the game genres that we have today didn't exist. There are immense amounts of space left to explore, but now everyone has moved on, to <abbr title="Virtual Reality">VR</abbr>, <abbr title="Augmented Reality">AR</abbr> or other.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_56.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>I made this entire talk in black and white, and I could have done a system in black and white too, but I made it in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_color_theorem" target="_blank">four colors</a>. Imagine how much power you have with four colors.</p>

<p>One-bit can be a totally evocative, things don't have to be visually busy all the time. I think this maximalism of 'I need all these features' and 'I need to be doing this and that,' is exhausting. Learning to live without float points is actually kind of nice. There is beauty in really simple systems, trying to always scale things to fit everyone's usage is foolish.</p>

<p>As a closing remark, I want to say that I don't think that my attempt is the best solution to data preservation, I'm not even sure if I'm gonna be able to use that system in five years, but at least it's one attempt at trying to preserve things.</p>

<p><a href="https://permacomputing.net/" target="_blank">Permacomputing</a> is inspired from permaculture, its goal is to build resilience. The resilience of permaculture comes from trying different ideas, and seeing what sticks. If we all jump on the same language, and the same ecosystem, it makes it really fragile when one individual can just buy the whole thing, then you're left with a system that was never truly yours.</p>

<p>Thank you for reading.</p>
