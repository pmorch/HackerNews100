            <section>
                <p>In the past few years, I've heard a lot about Avro, Parquet, ORC, Arrow and Feather, but I also keep hearing about Iceberg and Delta Lake. As a "database person", I’ve been struggling to understand all of these different things, and how they relate to Data Lakes and Data Lakehouses (and what exactly <em>are</em> these?). So, I’ve decided to study them, and consolidate my knowledge in writing.</p><p>To do this, I had to review quite a bit of content over the last few weeks. I’ll try to link to most of what I’ve read and watched at the bottom of this article. However, this blog post won’t be 100% comprehensive, or even the best starting point for most people. That’s because I’m writing this for myself. I find that the best way to learn new things is by "forcing myself" to re-explain them to others. Anyhow, I hope this is useful to some people!</p><h2 id="how-data-gets-stored-in-files-and-in-memory">How Data Gets Stored (in Files and in Memory)</h2><p>Let’s start with understanding the different file formats for efficient data access and storage. While some systems mainly operate on data formats that are closed (e.g., SingleStoreDB, where I work, Teradata, SQL Server, Snowflake), others operate on open data formats. And these days, most of them, like Snowflake, Redshift, Athena or Hive, support reading and writing into <em>both</em> open and closed storage formats (although there’s varying limitations around their write/read support on open formats).</p><p>These are some the main open source file formats for storing data efficiently:</p><ul><li><a href="https://avro.apache.org/?ref=davidgomes.com">Apache Avro</a> — Binary, Rowstore, Files</li><li><a href="https://parquet.apache.org/?ref=davidgomes.com">Apache Parquet</a> — Binary, Columnstore, Files</li><li><a href="https://orc.apache.org/?ref=davidgomes.com">Apache ORC</a> — Binary, Columnstore, Files</li><li><a href="https://arrow.apache.org/?ref=davidgomes.com">Apache Arrow</a> — Binary, Columnstore, In-Memory<ul><li>The best way to store Apache Arrow dataframes in files on disk is with <a href="https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/feather.html?ref=davidgomes.com">Feather</a>. However, it’s also possible to convert to Apache Parquet format and others.</li></ul></li><li><a href="https://protobuf.dev/?ref=davidgomes.com" rel="noreferrer">Protocol Buffers</a> (Protobuf) — Binary, N/A, In-Memory<ul><li>Protobuf is a language-neutral data structure definition language. Different implementations will store the data differently (it could be row-by-row, i.e., rowstore, or columnstore).</li></ul></li><li>(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values?ref=davidgomes.com" rel="noreferrer">CSV</a> — Text, Rowstore/Columnstore, Files)<ul><li>CSV is very different from the others on this list given its structure is extremely trivial. There is, however, a <a href="https://digital-preservation.github.io/csv-schema/?ref=davidgomes.com">"CSV Schema" language</a> definition, but it doesn’t seem to be very popular.</li></ul></li></ul><p>But what do the formats actually imply? <strong>The formats are specifications for how the data should be arranged in actual binary layout.</strong> There is a <a href="https://www.vladsiv.com/big-data-file-formats/?ref=davidgomes.com">really good blog post</a> by Vladimir Sivcevic about Avro vs Parquet vs ORC which explains the layouts ("structure") for each of the file types — I highly recommend reading it. Afterwards, one can understand where the metadata and the actual data should live in the file’s contents, and what the pros/cons of each format are. For instance, Parquet supports really good compression, whereas Avro is more suited for reading specific row blocks (it’s rowstore). However, both support an evolving schema, i.e., the ability to modify the schema of new data without having to rewrite all existing data. In addition, both support file splitting which is essential for parallel processing of data.</p><p>So now we’re starting to understand the most common Big Data file formats. These are really interesting, and you can spend a lot of time studying what makes them so powerful. The main thing to remember, however, is that because they’re open, you can work with these formats from a variety of programming languages and tools. As an example, the <a href="https://github.com/apache/parquet-format?ref=davidgomes.com">Apache Parquet’s repository</a> contains the specification for the actual file format, as well as a reference Java implementation. However, there’s libraries for pretty much every language that allow you to read/write from Parquet files.</p><pre><code>"""
The following is a snippet that writes some sample data to a
Parquet file on local disk. It uses Pandas to achieve that.
"""
&gt;&gt;&gt; import pandas as pd
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; # Create a Pandas DataFrame with sample data
&gt;&gt;&gt; data = {
...     'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'],
...     'Age': [25, 30, 35],
...     'City': ['New York', 'San Francisco', 'Los Angeles']
... }
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; df = pd.DataFrame(data)
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; # Write the data frame to a Parquet file
&gt;&gt;&gt; file_path = './sample_table.parquet'
&gt;&gt;&gt; df.to_parquet(file_path, index=False)
</code></pre><p>Presto/Trino, Spark, DuckDB, Hive, Dremio, Impala, AWS Athena and Apache Drill are just some of the engines that can work with Parquet files. I find this fascinating, and I can see how Parquet is very useful for data teams who want to ensure their data can be accessed by many different tools.</p><p>But the file formats are just one layer of the overall data stack. They are helpful for data scientists working on their own, or at a small scale. But by themselves, they don’t really give data engines all they need in order to manage large-scale, evolving datasets. And that’s what higher-level storage layers like the Hive Format, Iceberg and Delta Lake are for.</p><h2 id="data-management-at-scale-%E2%80%94-iceberg-and-delta-lake">Data Management at Scale — Iceberg and Delta Lake</h2><p>So, how can we store many different tables, and evolve the individual schemas of all of these tables, and do things like point-in-time reads, all while partitioning the data efficiently for queries? And how can external tools easily read these schemas? And how should statistics about the data be stored in order to build cost-based query optimizers for this data?</p><p>In order to do all this, we need a higher-level metadata layer around our data files. The file formats described above only specify the layout of one individual file. So, we need a table format of sorts, as well as a schema registry that allows tools to introspect any metadata about our datasets. One example of a schema registry is <a href="https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/schema-registry/index.html?ref=davidgomes.com" rel="noreferrer">Confluent Schema Registry</a>, which supports Avro and Protobuf, as it is more suited for streaming data which tends to be rowstore.</p><p>When it comes to columnar data, in 2009, <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2009/06/10/web/hive-a-petabyte-scale-data-warehouse-using-hadoop/?ref=davidgomes.com">Facebook launched Hive</a> with its own table metadata format (it now supports multiple formats though). Then, over the years, Netflix developed Iceberg to overcome some of Hive’s limitations, specifically around performance and scalability (I highly recommend going into the "Sources" section below for the historical context here). And then Databricks developed and eventually open sourced Delta Lake, which is an alternative to Iceberg. And both Iceberg and Delta Lake use Parquet as their individual file format! Hive, Delta Lake and Iceberg all support support of schema registry or metastore. In Hive, the HMS (Hive MetaStore), can be pretty much any RDBMS. Of course, Iceberg and Delta Lake have similar concepts (<a href="https://iceberg.apache.org/concepts/catalog/?ref=davidgomes.com" rel="noreferrer">Iceberg Catalogs</a>, <a href="https://www.databricks.com/product/unity-catalog?ref=davidgomes.com" rel="noreferrer">Unity Catalog</a>) — and these even allow organizations to manage governance for their data (i.e., who or which teams can access which tables).</p><p>I’m not going to go into the differences between Delta Lake and Iceberg. They essentially solve the same problems, in different ways. There’s also a lot of debate around how "open" Delta Lake is, given its development is not as diverse in terms of contributors as Iceberg’s. And the support for Iceberg across popular data warehouses, and lakehouses is growing very quickly — in the last few years, a lot of different providers announced support for Iceberg (Redshift, BigQuery, Snowflake, Athena, Dremio, etc.).</p><p><strong>The important thing to remember is that neither Delta Lake nor Iceberg are query or storage engines in of themselves.</strong> Instead, they’re open specifications that allow query engines to do their job. And they <em>enable</em> a lot of features such as:</p><ul><li>Partitioning<ul><li>In specific, Iceberg supports partitioning evolution. This means that you can change the partitioning scheme (or shard key) of a table without rewriting all the existing data. This was a huge painpoint at Netflix and it was one of the reasons they created Iceberg.</li></ul></li><li>Schema Evolution</li><li>Data Compression</li><li>ACID Transactions around schema changes</li><li>Efficient Query Optimization (things like column pruning, predicate pushdown, and statistics collection to accelerate queries)</li><li>Time travel (point in time queries)</li><li>…</li></ul><p>I studied the Iceberg specification, and I am extremely impressed by its design. It is no wonder that it is becoming extremely popular as a supported format by so many different systems. This will certainly drive products which operate on closed formats to be as performant as possible on their own formats, and to somehow support Iceberg/Delta Lake. However, there's no going back now — Iceberg will become a "checkbox feature", and all database systems will have to support it sooner or later. And can Iceberg eventually replace the closed data formats? This is more complicated, and it probably won't happen due to performance reasons. The truth is that developing a data format for a single query engine, which again only has to operate on that one data format, gives database developers the ability to extract maximum efficiency and innovate more quickly. But who knows!</p><h2 id="and-so-what-are-data-lakes-and-data-lakehouses">And so, what are Data Lakes and Data Lakehouses?</h2><p>Both of these terms have always been a bit confusing to me, but I’m starting to understand them better now.</p><p>So, a Data Lake is where companies store their large amounts of data in some raw format like OCR or Parquet, or even CSV files (picture an S3 bucket with lots of these files). This is different from a Data Warehouse where companies are storing this data in a more structured way (schematized SQL tables and database schemas). And Data Lakehouses are basically the conjunction between a Data Lake, and the ability to do things like running SQL queries, running batch jobs, and setting up data governance schemes. These can now be built on top of a Data Lake with Iceberg together with some query engine and other "add-ons", whereas before you’d need to adopt a Data Warehouse (or a more classic DMBS) to do these things.</p><p>Data Lakehouses leverage some sort of scalable storage as the location for all the data (HDFS or a Cloud Blob Store like S3). And they’ve optimized their query engines to be very fast on these storage engines. The idea, then, is that data lakehouses are basically the open version of a data warehouse. And finally, some examples of Data Lakehouse products are Databricks and Dremio.</p><p>However, I think the line between a Data Warehouse and a Data Lakehouse is becoming more blurry as certain warehouses such as Snowflake and BigQuery add support for open data formats like Iceberg. This will be very interesting to observe over the years to come!</p><h2 id="that%E2%80%99s-it">That’s it!</h2><p>Thank you for sticking around — hopefully the "Sources" section below is also interesting. I certainly learnt a lot while writing this blog post, as I wrote it for myself more than anything else. As such, I don’t expect others to be able to take too much away from this.</p><p>Feel free to&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/davidrfgomes?ref=davidgomes.com">reach out on Twitter</a>!</p><h2 id="sources">Sources</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.vladsiv.com/big-data-file-formats/?ref=davidgomes.com">https://www.vladsiv.com/big-data-file-formats/</a></li><li>"<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05028?ref=davidgomes.com">An Empirical Evaluation of Columnar Storage Formats", X Zeng, Y Hui, J Shen, A Pavlo, W McKinney, H Zhang, 2023</a><ul><li>This is a very good paper which analyzes the different columnar storage formats, and how they stack up against each other in terms of performance.</li></ul></li><li><a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/demystifying-the-parquet-file-format-13adb0206705?ref=davidgomes.com">https://towardsdatascience.com/demystifying-the-parquet-file-format-13adb0206705</a></li><li><a href="https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/schema-registry/index.html?ref=davidgomes.com">https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/schema-registry/index.html</a></li><li><a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/operationalizing-the-data/9781492049517/ch04.html?ref=davidgomes.com">https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/operationalizing-the-data/9781492049517/ch04.html</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-gIUf9e9CCskP6wP-NKRU9VhofMHYjcd&amp;ref=davidgomes.com">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-gIUf9e9CCskP6wP-NKRU9VhofMHYjcd</a><ul><li>I watched a few videos, and found the first two on this playlist to be especially helpful.</li></ul></li><li><a href="https://www.databricks.com/discover/data-lakes?ref=davidgomes.com">https://www.databricks.com/discover/data-lakes</a></li><li><a href="https://www.databricks.com/glossary/data-lakehouse?ref=davidgomes.com">https://www.databricks.com/glossary/data-lakehouse</a></li></ul><h3 id="netflix-and-iceberg">Netflix and Iceberg</h3><p>There are a few talks, that if watched in order, will give you a really good historical overview into how Apache Iceberg came to be:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4OU6i4AQsI&amp;ref=davidgomes.com">AWS re:Invent 2015 | (BDT303) Running Spark and Presto on the Netflix Big Data Platform</a><ul><li>This talk from 2015 goes over how Netflix used Spark and Presto at the time, with S3 as their "data warehouse" (the term lakehouse didn’t exist back then).</li></ul></li><li><a href="https://www.slideshare.net/kbajda/presto-summit-2018-09-netflix-iceberg?ref=davidgomes.com">https://www.slideshare.net/kbajda/presto-summit-2018-09-netflix-iceberg</a><ul><li>These are the slides from "Presto Summit 2018" introducing Iceberg.

youtube channel posted a short and fun&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olISecOUX1g&amp;t=959s">video</a>
about effects in Koka (and 12 (!) other languages).
</p></li>
<li>
<p>2021-09-01 (pinned) The ICFP'21 tutorial
“<em>Programming with Effect Handlers and FBIP in Koka</em>” is now available on 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OFhD_mHtKA">youtube</a>.
</p></li>
<li>
<p>2022-02-07: Koka v2.4.0 released: improved specialization and <code>int</code> operations, add <code>rbtree-fbip</code> sample,
improve grammar (<code>pub</code> (instead of <code>public</code>, remove private (as everything is private by default now)), 
<code>final ctl</code> (instead of <code>brk</code>), underscores in number literals, etc), rename <code>double</code> to <code>float64</code>, various bug fixes.
</p></li>
<li>
<p>2021-12-27: Koka v2.3.8 released: improved <code>int</code> performance, various bug fixes, update wasm backend, 
initial conan support, fix js backend.
</p></li>
<li>
<p>2021-11-26: Koka v2.3.6 released: 
<code>maybe</code>-like types are already value types, but now also no longer need heap allocation 
if not nested (and <code>[<span>Just</span>(<span>1</span>)]</code> uses the same heap space as <code>[<span>1</span>]</code>),
improved atomic refcounting (by Anton Lorenzen), improved specialization (by Steven Fontanella),
various small fixes, add <code><span>std/os/</span>readline</code>, fix build on freeBSD  
</p></li>
<li>
<p>2021-10-15: Koka v2.3.2 released, with initial wasm support 
(use <code>--target<span>=</span>wasm</code>, and install&nbsp;<a href="https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html" data-linkid="emscripten">emscripten</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://wasmtime.dev/" data-linkid="wasmtime">wasmtime</a>), 
improved reuse specialization (by Anton Lorenzen), and various bug fixes.
</p></li>
<li>
<p>2021-09-29: Koka v2.3.1 released, with improved TRMC optimizations, and improved reuse 
(the rbtree benchmark is as fast as C++ now), and 
faster effect operations. Experimental: allow elision of <code><span>-&gt;</span></code> in anonymous
function expressions (e.g. <code>xs<span>.</span>map( fn(x) x + <span>1</span> )</code>) and operation clauses.
Command line options changed a bit with <code>.koka</code> as the standard output directory.  
</p></li>
<li>
<p>2021-09-20: Koka v2.3.0 released, with new 
<a href="https://koka-lang.github.io/koka/doc/book.html#sec-layout">brace elision</a> and if/match
conditions without parenthesis. Updated the javascript backend
using ES6 modules and BigInt. new <code><span>module</span> <span>std/num/int64</span></code>, improved effect operation performance.
</p></li>
<li>
<p>2021-09-05: Koka v2.2.1 released, with initial parallel tasks, the binary-trees benchmark, and
<a href="https://koka-lang.github.io/koka/doc/book.html#sec-layout">brace elision</a>.
</p></li>
<li>
<p>2021-08-26: Koka v2.2.0 released, improved simplification (by Rashika B), cross-module specialization (Steven Fontanella),
and borrowing annotations with improved reuse analysis (Anton Lorenzen).

It resembles a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_sign" title="Traffic sign">road sign</a> that indicates a "dangerous bend" in the road ahead, and is used to mark passages tricky on a first reading or with an especially difficult argument.<sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
					<p>My children are hopelessly addicted to their gaming devices. This is a problem, but not one that I can directly solve because the school mandates that they have both an Android smartphone <em>and</em> a Windows laptop. Rather than to meet the problem head on I figured the better way to address it is to replace consumption with creation. But creating anything at all on a smartphone or a laptop, where the competition is insane, and the toolchains super complex is going to be an uphill battle. After all, a typical game title these days has a studio full of people dedicated to it, large teams of developers and so on. There isn’t really anything you can do that will come close to being able to compete with the eye candy and 3D stuff your average game contains.</p>

<p>But where you could compete is on the fun factor. And in that sense some of those old games are right up there with the new ones, if not downright more fun. It’s also a much better match for my skillset, and far easier for a novice to get into if we piggyback on the Arduino eco-system, which has some fairly powerful options in their offering. More or less by chance I ran into a place that sells interesting hardware bits, in this case a 32x8 display of addressable LEDs.</p>

<p><img src="https://jacquesmattheij.com/48x32_ledmodule.jpg"><br></p>

<p>Not a cheap component at 20 euros each or so, but actually cheaper than the individual LEDs. Still, 32x8 is a bit anemic for any kind of game so I ganged up 6 of them in a rectangle for a 48x32 display, which gives this project its name.</p>

<p><img src="https://jacquesmattheij.com/48x32_display.jpg"><br></p>

<p>An enclosure of sorts is a must, so I lasercut a box with a relatively cheap Chinese made lasercutter that cuts plywood like it’s cardboard and with insane precision. I could never make something with this level of fit by hand. Getting it all to work was a bit fiddly but in the end I got a set of parts that were good to be used for the real thing.</p>

<img src="https://jacquesmattheij.com/48x32_lasercutter_front.jpg"><br></p>

<p>Joysticks were another challenge, but a smaller one, Thingiverse to the rescue, <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:700346" target="_new">a really simple thing to print</a> and it fit on the first try, here is the finished result and what’s inside it:</p>

<p><img src="https://jacquesmattheij.com/48x32_controller_guts.jpg"><br>
<img src="https://jacquesmattheij.com/48x32_controller.jpg"><br></p>

<p>Putting it all together, an Arduino R4 as the computer component and some standard wiring and some connectors to hook it all together will get you this:</p>

<p>And after some more work here is the Nokia ‘Snake’ game in its natural environment:</p>

<p><img src="https://jacquesmattheij.com/48x32_snake.jpg"><br></p>

      Daihatsu, the Japanese automaker owned by Toyota, has halted domestic production after admitting it forged the results of safety tests for its vehicles for more than 30 years.

      The brand, best known for manufacturing small passenger cars, has stopped output at all four of its Japanese factories as of Tuesday, including one at its headquarters in Osaka, a spokesperson told CNN.

      The shutdown will last through at least the end of January, affecting roughly 9,000 employees who work in domestic production, according to the representative.

      The move comes as Daihatsu grapples with a deepening safety scandal that Toyota <a href="https://global.toyota/en/newsroom/corporate/40238738.html" target="_blank">says</a> “has shaken the very foundations of the company.”
  </p>

      Last week, Daihatsu <a href="https://www.daihatsu.com/news/2023/20231220-4.html" target="_blank">announced</a> an independent third-party committee had found evidence of tampering with safety tests on as many as 64 vehicle models, including those sold under the Toyota brand.

      As a result, Daihatsu said it would temporarily suspend all domestic and international vehicle shipments and consult with authorities on how to move forward.

      The scandal is another blow to the automaker, which had admitted <a href="https://www.daihatsu.com/news/2023/20230428-4.html" target="_blank">in April</a> to violating standards on crash tests on more than 88,000 cars, mostly sold under the Toyota brand in countries such as Malaysia and Thailand.

      In that case, “the inside lining of the front seat door was improperly modified” for some checks, while Daihatsu did not comply with regulatory requirements for certain side collision tests, it said in a statement at the time.

  <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clqnfgufn000o3b6h608w3itz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
      In May, the automaker <a href="https://www.daihatsu.com/news/2023/20230519-6.html" target="_blank">said</a> it had discovered more wrongdoing, revealing that it had submitted incorrect data for collision tests on two hybrid electric vehicles.

      The latest probe further threatens the company’s reputation. According to a <a href="https://www.daihatsu.com/news/2023/report_1_E.pdf" target="_blank">report</a> released last Wednesday by the investigative committee, 174 more cases were found of Daihatsu manipulating data, making false statements or improperly tinkering with vehicles to pass safety certification tests.

      The oldest case was traced back to 1989, with a noted increase in the number of cases since 2014, the report said.

      In response, the Japanese behemoth has promised to shake up its subsidiary, saying in a&nbsp;<a href="https://global.toyota/en/newsroom/corporate/40238738.html" target="_blank">statement</a> last week that “fundamental reform is needed to revitalize Daihatsu.”

In fact, if we extract all the CUDA binary files in PyTorch, we get ~3830 files!</li><li><code>cuobjdump</code> can print out all the information in a CUDA binary (i.e. it can be used to validate a complete parser)</li></ul><p>This approach also made it straightforward to incrementally implement the parser. For example, if my implementation only parsed one field, I could modify the comparison step to only validate that piece of the output. This let me check a subset of the parsing logic across thousands of files without needing to understand the whole file format.</p><p>By highlighting specific differences between the output of the real <code>cuobjdump</code> and my implementation, it became easy to find and fix bugs. This also made it easy to add support for new versions of CUDA and new GPU architectures.</p><p>Concretely, if I was trying to parse a byte sequence like <code>0x04 0x17 ...</code>, I could look at a bunch of examples and come up with a hypothesis like "If the first byte is <code>0x04</code>, the format is <code>EIFMT_SVAL</code>." By testing hypotheses like this one across all the sample files, I could build the parser piece by piece. This was fairly efficient because the test process was automated and displayed clear diffs when the outputs didn't match.</p><p>Here's the byte sequence that corresponds to the first section of the <code>cuobjdump</code> output above:</p><div><pre><code><span><span>0x04</span> <span>// Format: EIFMT_SVAL</span>

<p><strong>No good deed goes unpunished (at least in Europe)</strong></p>



<p>Those who know me know I wrote my first code in the early 80s, and though I never made a career of it, I dabbled early-on like all the other geeks. In those days, we all wrote and swapped simple games and trivial tools. At that time, it was one of the main functions of the bulletin boards that would one day spawn the internet. The idea we’d pay for software one day was lurking, but free was more the norm. Bandwidth and storage were what was monetized back then. The idea someone might sue us for a program bug or unexpected crash was not even remotely on our minds.</p>



<p>Ah, to be so innocent and naive again.</p>

<p>You might be surprised to learn that, as I write, the EU is finalizing rules that will make open-source creators and licensees liable for any user harm their software might cause. The focus for lawmakers is that, like cars and chainsaws, software is complex and can be inherently dangerous. Policymakers believe that consumers are at a disadvantage when things go horribly wrong: how can they prove someone sold them faulty software when they can’t hope to understand how apps work or how they’re created? The solution they’re adopting is to shift the onus to the software and app creators to prove their code didn’t do anything wrong. This will be burdensome but is at least possible if you write and market your own code. But what if you’re just part of a collaborative open source project, give away your app, or if there’s open source code in the product you put on the market? Who gets blamed when open source might be the heart of the problem?</p>



<p><strong>EU policymakers are clear; going forward, someone must be liable for software harm.</strong> Data was lost, customers couldn’t transact, files got garbled, hackers made entries – someone in the software chain must make the user whole. Today you can license-away that liability by putting the onus on the user to accept the risk, since bugs happen and hackers hack. Not your fault, you did your best, and you told the user that upfront. My read of the emerging regime changes that. It forces you to prove your code wasn’t the cause of the harm – “strict liability” in legal circles. Products like cars often get regulated this way. Essentially, the carmaker is at fault when something goes wrong unless they can prove they’re not. It’s a way of shifting societal costs back to the party that profits from the product in question. It allows consumers to be confident that cars are safe, without having an expert reverse engineer them before use or agreeing to accept that the brakes may fail – too bad for you. The carmaker designed and built a complex thing so they should be in the best position to prove they implemented appropriate safeguards.</p>



<p>So, how is open-source software implicated? If a commercial software product causes harm, whoever put the software on the market will soon be strictly liable. You will need to prove that your code wasn’t to blame to escape the costs. But what if you’ve embedded open-source code, used open-source tools, or called open-source APIs? Under the pending rules, you’d be liable for any errors in those sources as well, regardless of whether you directly contributed or not. A license like the one Apache provides won’t help, since state-imposed strict liability isn’t a harm that can be licensed away by private actors. The user must be made whole, and that’s on you. Worse still, how will you in turn identify or sue the collaborator or collaboration that actually wrote the faulty open-source code to recoup your costs? In that case, the license you signed likely insulates your open-source partners from your claims.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/u1UbotkGPqkBI1vLYXUk-N-VVxO8G5bxZ7LxHO-fo8_ddSHqPucKT6pD-qigwr9Gity11btgUM3nPOufuKSpsjo56zvHTS7GO2tOd-bd-5cZJUjkqC_3x89n05KzUOiSVPvfyXTnJ17-TN3iRPe7D2g" alt=""></figure>







<p>Let’s unpack that and put it simply. If a user is harmed by software, the person they paid (targeted ads would count) must compensate them for the harm – unless the software provider can prove their software played no role in the breach/loss/failure/psychological/physical/financial or other harm.<strong> If open source resources are in/called/touched your code, you’re responsible for their performance too.</strong> The open source resource licensed away their liability to you. Oops.</p>



<p>So what will the world look like when this change takes place? First off, despite the fact that many open source tools and resources are more robust and better reviewed than anything you could produce in-house, you’ll need to decide whether you accept the cost if they harm your users. That includes the burden of proving they didn’t, if you think that’s the case. Put another way, it may be hard to prove your code isn’t at fault without reviewing and defending every open source element involved. The open source community will have two choices: leave the licensing regime in place and leave those who use the code to hold the bag, or collaboratively assess and defend projects as claims emerge – even though that kind-of-means you need to assess your licensee’s code to ensure they didn’t just dump their own problem on you. More likely than not the open source community will choose the simpler path, stay the course,&nbsp; and leave others to deal with the new complexities.</p>



<p>The economic impact of this change reduces the value of open source software by placing the burden of bugs and breaches on developers who use and incorporate this code – even if they can prove the open source was at fault. Users must be made whole, open source add-ons have licensed away liability, and so the middle man is on the hook unless they can prove both the open source and closed source code they use is blame free. But that’s not a huge change – just the strict liability burden with open source collaborations getting a free pass. So why am I preaching doom?</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/W20MaDgP8fZ7DcxjlXdZxA_u-5spvKAlCIzNJ3EqZ5HRMhY2ngJlglW0BoQxYhj6ADoey5eKVdF_M3KRPBUZQxzGjGGZ88h7lXI-DaXPtK61BPI4_wRuC3EL2E_eV8cRXRpWcJX8SZat5GSV4RXxyys" alt=""></figure>







<p><strong>What if an open source project is used directly by consumers, and causes them harm?</strong> The public policy is clear: they must be compensated. Does it matter if they signed a license or didn’t pay someone? Their business is bankrupt, their files are in a hacker’s hands, or their own customers are suing them. Someone should be strictly liable. But who?</p>



<p>The EU is grappling with that very question, and it culminates in whether “open source” is exempt from liability in a law designed to protect consumers. So far the answer is “probably not?” Exemption means consumers bear the cost – exactly what the law is trying to change. Perhaps if the open source in question remains an academic or research tool, versus reaching consumers, we’re okay? The proof may come when the first consumer demands compensation, and the courts step in. But lawmakers know enough to realize that much of the open source out there – by definition – belongs to no one, or many someones, or really nobody that can be named and made liable. So waiting on a court case might provide clarity but no compensation and no one to even argue the case. Not the clarity a law is designed to provide.</p>



<p>My prediction, for what it’s worth, is that open source’s days outside academia and hobbyists are numbered. At some point, some government authority will require a single throat-to-choke when open source causes consumer harm. <strong>Someone, or some entity, will need to accept financial and legal responsibility for what the project does in consumer hands. No license can insulate them from that.</strong> Given that existing open source licenses don’t contemplate a private purchase, they’ll need to either wind down, release licensees from taking them commercial, or find a means to restrict consumer use (which may be hard with no one in control). Policy makers simply won’t allow a dangerous animal to wander around unchained, and a lack of owner won’t make the situation better.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p><span>Last week US Steel announced it was </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/japans-nippon-steel-plans-acquire-us-steel-7-bln-nikkei-2023-12-18/" rel="">being acquired</a><span> by Japanese steel company Nippon Steel. The milestone gives an opportunity to look back at what once was the largest and most important company in the US (and arguably the world), and how it slowly declined. Prior to the acquisition announcement, US Steel had a market cap of around $8 billion, not even enough to put it in the Fortune 500 (it would come in at around #690, slightly below the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Roadhouse" rel="">Texas Roadhouse</a><span> restaurant chain).</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1-140174766" href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/no-inventions-no-innovations-a-history#footnote-1-140174766" target="_self" rel="">1</a></span><span> Over its lifespan, the company slowly but steadily lost market share and importance. When it was formed in 1901, it was by far the largest company in the world, and produced nearly 2/3rds of American steel. Today, it makes just 12% of American steel, around a third of the steel that it made in 1955, and employs around the same number of people as online pet retailer </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chewy_(company)" rel="">Chewy</a><span>.</span></p><p>How did a once mighty industrial titan fall so far? Let’s take a look.</p><p>By the turn of the 20th century, the American steel industry had eclipsed Britain to be the largest and most efficient in the world. In 1896, an engineer for the Pennsylvania Steel Company wrote that “within the last decade America has made marvelous developments in her iron industry, until she now leads the world in the quantity of her products and bows to none in their quality”. Relentless competitors like Andrew Carnegie of Carnegie Steel had, in the course of expanding their steelmaking capacity and acquiring market share, steadily driven down the price of steel, which fell by more than 80% between 1870 and 1896.</p><p>But these successes had come at a cost. Steel production was subject to very large economies of scale - the larger your blast furnaces, and the more Bessemer converters and open hearth furnaces you operated, the cheaper making steel became. And because of the high fixed costs of these facilities, producers were incentivized to keep them full, cutting prices to just above the marginal cost of production in times of low demand. The result was chronic overcapacity and as steelmakers built ever-larger facilities and tried to underprice each other - at the end of the 19th century, nearly half of steelmaking capacity in the US went unused each year.</p><p><span>There was thus a growing desire for consolidation of the industry. If many competing firms were combined, production volumes of the new firm would rise and duplicate plant could be eliminated, enabling even greater economies of scale and lowered costs. The instigating event for such a merger was a&nbsp;banquet of bankers and industrialists in 1900, where Carnegie Steel president Charles Schwab spoke of the potential benefits of industry rationalization via merger. Less than 4 months later, it was done. Organized by JP Morgan, a new company was created by combining Carnegie Steel and Federal Steel, along with a hodgepodge of smaller companies including National Steel, American Sheet Steel, and American Hoop.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2-140174766" href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/no-inventions-no-innovations-a-history#footnote-2-140174766" target="_self" rel="">2</a></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The new company, US Steel, was a monster. The first company to be worth more than $1 billion, the company had 168,000 employees and produced just under 9 million tons of steel annually, over 60% of all the steel in the US. And it quickly grew even larger. By 1917 US Steel (now up to 268,000 employees) was more than </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffkauflin/2017/09/19/americas-top-50-companies-1917-2017/?sh=378273e16295" rel="">3 times as large</a><span> as the next largest company, AT&amp;T, and had more than 7 times as many employees as Standard Oil when </span><a href="https://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,871865,00.html" rel="">it was broken up</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>The decades prior to the formation of US Steel were characterized by cutthroat competition, but that ended with the formation of US Steel. The head of the new company, Judge Elbert Gary, was a fundamentally conservative businessman, and his desire was to bring stability to what was a cyclical and chaotic industry. Whereas previously companies like Carnegie Steel would constantly cut prices to achieve greater market share and drive their competitors out of business, Gary set (generally) higher prices, and kept them high even as demand for steel fluctuated. Though its size did give it production cost advantages, these savings were retained as higher profits rather than passed on to the consumer. Gary was, according to former managing director of Carnegie Steel James Gayley, “opposed to the old method of going out into the market and slashing prices in order to get business”. To maintain prices in the face of fluctuating demand, Gary would gather the industry’s leadership together in regular “</span><a href="https://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,728689,00.html" rel="">Gary Dinners</a><span>”, where price levels would be agreed upon and Gary would “exhort the chairmen, presidents, or other major owners of steel companies to maintain rank”. Those who refused to cooperate would be “disciplined” by the others. Many former Carnegie Steel executives, schooled in the intense competition of the Carnegie years, were allergic to this strategy, and departed for other steel companies.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F007ea525-dd47-4ec3-afea-f04bcfa28ccc_606x451.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F007ea525-dd47-4ec3-afea-f04bcfa28ccc_606x451.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F007ea525-dd47-4ec3-afea-f04bcfa28ccc_606x451.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F007ea525-dd47-4ec3-afea-f04bcfa28ccc_606x451.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F007ea525-dd47-4ec3-afea-f04bcfa28ccc_606x451.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F007ea525-dd47-4ec3-afea-f04bcfa28ccc_606x451.png" width="606" height="451" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/007ea525-dd47-4ec3-afea-f04bcfa28ccc_606x451.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:451,&quot;width&quot;:606,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F007ea525-dd47-4ec3-afea-f04bcfa28ccc_606x451.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F007ea525-dd47-4ec3-afea-f04bcfa28ccc_606x451.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F007ea525-dd47-4ec3-afea-f04bcfa28ccc_606x451.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F007ea525-dd47-4ec3-afea-f04bcfa28ccc_606x451.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Via Temin 1964 and USGS</figcaption></figure></div><p>Gary proved adept at navigating the company through a cultural climate that was increasingly hostile towards potential monopolies. Under his leadership, the company successfully fought off a Justice Department lawsuit to break up the company as an illegal monopoly. (Perversely, the court ruled that the Gary Dinners proved that US Steel did not have the power to set prices, and thus couldn’t be a monopoly). But other threats proved harder to cope with. US Steel was consistently behind on adopting the latest steelmaking technology, and was often forced to license technologies from more forward-looking companies (some of which were run by former Carnegie men). A 1936 magazine article described early US Steel company policy as “No inventions; no innovations”.</p><p>In 1902, for instance, a man named Henry Grey invented what was known as a “Universal Beam Mill”. At the time, beams were made in the shape of an uppercase I, with a tall vertical web capped with narrow flanges at the top and the bottom. If you wanted wider flanges capable of carrying heavier loads, you would need to weld or rivet steel plates to the beam, an expensive and time-consuming process. The Universal Mill made it possible to roll wide-flange beams in a single operation, eliminating the process of attaching extra steel plates. Grey first brought his mill design to US Steel, but it was rejected by the finance committee. Instead, the first Universal Mill in the US was built by Bethlehem Steel, run by former Carnegie president Charles Schwab. Faced with declining market share in the growing construction steel market (which made heavy use of wide-flange steel beams), US Steel was ultimately forced to license the Universal Mill from Bethlehem in 1926.</p><p>The same pattern repeated for other new technologies. In the 1920s, technology for making large-diameter pipe by electrical resistance welding was invented. Though it was (supposedly) first offered to US Steel, the company again passed, only to adopt it several years later to keep up with its competitors. Around the same time, technology for continuous rolling of wide sheets of steel was invented, which greatly reduced production costs. US Steel had investigated continuous sheet rolling as early as 1902, but had abandoned its efforts. Instead, it was once again forced to license the technology from others to remain competitive (though in fairness, it was one of the first manufacturers to license it).</p><p>More generally, US Steel’s enormous size made it unwieldy and difficult to manage. It took time for information to filter up through the many layers of management between the factory floor and company leadership, and to get all of the disparate operations of the company moving in the same direction. This, on top of the fundamental conservative culture created by Gary, and the lack of top management talent as former Carnegie executives abandoned the company, caused US Steel to steadily lose market share to its more agile rivals. The company continued to grow, but other companies grew faster. By 1941 US Steel’s output had risen to nearly 30 million tons of steel annually, triple what it made when it was founded, but its market share had fallen from over 60% to around 35%.</p><p><span>At the end of WWII, the American steel industry was an unchallenged juggernaut. During the war, American steel production had risen by more than a third, while the steel industries of most other countries had been nearly wiped out. By 1945, America was producing over 60% of the world’s steel. American steelmakers had the latest technology, unparalleled expertise, the largest economies of scale, and easy access to resources such as iron ore and coal. In 1945, the president of the US Steel Export Company George Wolf testified before congress that “the European steel industry is still far behind that of the United States, product, quality, and cost wise”, and that the gap was “an ever-widening one”. Japan, which would later emerge as a steel juggernaut, wasn’t even on the radar, producing just </span><a href="https://academic.oup.com/book/27157/chapter-abstract/196566880?redirectedFrom=fulltext" rel="">0.56 million tons</a><span> in 1946 against America’s 66 million tons. US Steel continued to dominate the industry, producing more than twice as much steel as the next largest company (Bethlehem Steel), and averaging around 30% of American steel output in the mid-1950s.</span></p><p>With seemingly no rivals on the horizon, American steel companies, including US Steel, became complacent. The post-war years are sometimes described as the “dodo period” of the American steel industry, as it steadily raised prices (steel prices rose at 7% annually between 1947 and 1957) and enjoyed large profits while ignoring the progress that was taking place in other parts of the world.</p><p><span>As American steelmakers built new capacity to meet post-war demand (by 1962 American steel capacity reached 154 million tons annually, nearly twice the production at the end of WWII), they did so using existing steelmaking technology, primarily the open hearth furnace. In an open hearth furnace, a combination of liquid pig iron from a blast furnace and steel scrap is placed in a large crucible, which is then heated using burning gas blown through a </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regenerative_heat_exchanger" rel="">regenerative heat exchanger</a><span>. In 1954, over 90% of steelmaking capacity in the US was open hearth furnaces, with the balance a mix of electric arc furnaces and Bessemer converters.</span></p><p>But in 1952, a new steelmaking technology appeared, the Basic Oxygen Furnace (BOF). The BOF was in a sense a refinement of the earlier Bessemer converter, the first technology for mass-producing steel. Whereas the Bessemer converter worked by blowing air through liquid pig iron from below, the BOF worked by blowing pure oxygen into pig iron from above. Oxygen furnaces had been conceived as early as the mid-19th century, but weren’t feasible to build until pure oxygen began to be made on an industrial scale in the 20th century.</p><p>The open hearth furnace replaced Bessemer converters because the latter was difficult to control, tended to result in nitrogen-embrittled steel, and was limited in the types of ore it could use. But open hearths came with drawbacks. They were more expensive to build, ran slower, and required much more fuel than Bessemer converters. Only cheap scrap metal, which could be remelted in an open hearth furnace along with liquid pig iron, made them economical to operate.</p><p>The BOF, by contrast, had many of the benefits of the Bessemer converter (rapid conversion of iron to steel, low fuel and labor costs, comparatively cheaper to build) while eliminating many of its drawbacks (nitrogen embrittlement, limitations on types of ore it could use).</p><p>The first commercial BOF was built in Austria in 1952, and diffused through the industry as other companies experimented with it. By the end of the 1950s, it was clear that the BOF could produce steel more cheaply than the open hearth furnace (and in fact, no new open hearth integrated steelworks were built in the US after 1958).</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa32d9817-2b08-471b-8016-6a13cd9b2c40_540x345.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa32d9817-2b08-471b-8016-6a13cd9b2c40_540x345.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa32d9817-2b08-471b-8016-6a13cd9b2c40_540x345.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa32d9817-2b08-471b-8016-6a13cd9b2c40_540x345.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa32d9817-2b08-471b-8016-6a13cd9b2c40_540x345.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa32d9817-2b08-471b-8016-6a13cd9b2c40_540x345.png" width="540" height="345" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a32d9817-2b08-471b-8016-6a13cd9b2c40_540x345.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:345,&quot;width&quot;:540,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa32d9817-2b08-471b-8016-6a13cd9b2c40_540x345.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa32d9817-2b08-471b-8016-6a13cd9b2c40_540x345.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa32d9817-2b08-471b-8016-6a13cd9b2c40_540x345.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa32d9817-2b08-471b-8016-6a13cd9b2c40_540x345.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>But US Steel was once again slow to adopt the technology. Reluctant to abandon expensive open hearths that had years of useful life left, as late as 1962 US Steel executives were arguing that open hearth steel would remain competitive. US Steel didn’t build its first BOF until 1964, well behind other American companies like Kaiser Steel, which by 1964 was making 43% of its steel in BOFs.</p><p>Though US Steel was once again a laggard, it was emblematic of the entire US Steel industry, which was comparatively slow to adopt the BOF. By the time US Steel built its first BOF, the BOF was producing around 17% of steel in the US, compared to around 55% of steel in Japan.</p><p>And the BOF wasn’t the only steel technology where Japan was pushing ahead of America. In pursuit of ever-larger economies of scale, Japan went far beyond the US in the size of its blast furnaces. By the mid-1970s, average blast furnace size at Nippon Steel was 4 times the average at US Steel, and by 1977 more than half the blast furnaces in Japan had a volume of more than 2000 cubic meters, compared to just 2.6% of furnaces in the US. When US Steel had trouble with its own large blast furnace at its Gary Works, it was eventually forced to turn to the Japanese for help, who by then had much more experience than Americans operating very large furnaces.</p><p>A similar trajectory occurred with continuous casting technology, which produced continuous slabs of steel instead of individual ingots, and thus eliminated much of the rolling required for steel production. Though US firms pioneered much of this research, other countries adopted it more quickly. By 1975, only 9% of steel was continuously cast in the US, compared to 31% in Japan and 24% in West Germany. Here again, US Steel lagged, and didn’t widely adopt continuous casting until the early 1990s.</p><p>Thus, by the early 1960s cracks in America’s seemingly unassailable steel industry were beginning to show. Foreign producers like Japan had expanded their industries and adopted the newest steelmaking technology like the BOF and continuous casting. American steelmakers like US Steel, saddled with outdated technology and high labor costs, found themselves under threat from foreign producers for the first time. By 1958 some steelmakers in Germany and Japan were able to compete on price with US producers, and by the mid-1970s input costs for Japanese steel (ore, labor, coking coal, etc.) were nearly half those of US costs. Between 1955 and 1970 steel imports to the US increased by more than factor of 10, going from less than 2% of US production to more than 15%, and continued to rise.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F785d8481-3ce4-4033-a877-cdca332604e9_733x463.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F785d8481-3ce4-4033-a877-cdca332604e9_733x463.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F785d8481-3ce4-4033-a877-cdca332604e9_733x463.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F785d8481-3ce4-4033-a877-cdca332604e9_733x463.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F785d8481-3ce4-4033-a877-cdca332604e9_733x463.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F785d8481-3ce4-4033-a877-cdca332604e9_733x463.png" width="733" height="463" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/785d8481-3ce4-4033-a877-cdca332604e9_733x463.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:463,&quot;width&quot;:733,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F785d8481-3ce4-4033-a877-cdca332604e9_733x463.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F785d8481-3ce4-4033-a877-cdca332604e9_733x463.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F785d8481-3ce4-4033-a877-cdca332604e9_733x463.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F785d8481-3ce4-4033-a877-cdca332604e9_733x463.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>In the face of foreign pressure, US Steel could no longer maintain the “price leadership” it had in the past, setting whatever price it wanted and encouraging the rest of the industry to follow suit.

Its annual output of steel was just over 27 million tons, less than it had produced in 1941, and its share of the US market had fallen to around 24%.</span></p><p>The American steel industry responded to the rise of foreign producers not by trying to improve their operations, but by demanding government protection from “unfair” foreign trade practices. In 1968, steel producers in Japan and Europe, at the behest of President Lyndon Johnson, agreed to artificially restrict their steel exports to the US. This was intended to give US producers “breathing room” to modernize their facilities and improve operations, though this didn’t occur (in fact, capital investment by American steelmakers declined after the agreements). And though pressure had been temporarily removed, things were about to get much worse for US Steel and the American steel industry.</p><p><span>Having temporarily fended off foreign threats, American steel production continued to climb. In 1973, right around when Hyman Roth was boasting that their mafia operations were “</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rmxluz27Q-4" rel="">bigger than US Steel</a><span>”, America produced 137 million tons of steel, more than any other country in the world. While not the unrivaled behemoth it once was, US Steel was still the </span><a href="https://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune500_archive/full/1973/" rel="">13th largest company in the US</a><span> by revenue, and the largest steelmaker in the US.</span></p><p>It was widely predicted that demand for steel would continue to rise, as it had for most of the 20th century. In 1972, chairman of US Steel Edwin Gott predicted that worldwide demand for steel would rise 25% by 1980. Countries around the world expanded their steelmaking capacity in anticipation.</p><p>Instead, demand for steel stagnated. Between 1973 and 1984 worldwide demand for steel was essentially flat, and in industrialized countries it declined by around 25%. Steelmakers around the world, faced with large amounts of excess capacity, were incentivized to sell steel for just above the variable costs of production, “dumping” it on foreign markets. It’s somewhat unclear if such dumping actually occurred, but steel imports to the US continued to rise through the 1970s even as overall demand dropped. And US Steel was hurt most of all - nearly all of the loss in market share to foreign steelmakers came at the expense of US Steel.</p><p><span>American producers once again demanded government protection from foreign competition. They filed dozens of “antidumping” cases under the Trade Act of 1974, and secured other protectionist measures such as a “</span><a href="https://www.clevelandfed.org/publications/economic-commentary/1982/ec-19820517-the-steel-trigger-price-mechanism" rel="">trigger price mechanism</a><span>” in 1978 (which prevented foreign steelmakers from selling below their total costs of production) and a new round of voluntary export restrictions in 1984.</span></p><p>These measures helped stave off foreign competition - steel imports declined from 26 million tons in 1984 to 17 million tons in 1989. But they couldn’t stop a threat that was emerging from within the US: the minimill.</p><p>Historically, steel had been produced in large, integrated steelworks. Iron ore would be turned into pig iron in a blast furnace, which would then be turned into steel in an open hearth or basic oxygen furnace. From there, the steel would be cast into ingots or slabs and then rolled into various shapes - wire, rods, plate, beams, sheets, and so on.</p><p>But in the late 1960s, a new type of steelmaking facility began to appear, the minimill. The minimill made steel not by processing iron ore, but by remelting scrap steel in an electric arc furnace. By eliminating the blast furnaces which turned iron ore into pig iron, minimills were not only much cheaper to build than integrated steelworks (as little as 1/10th the cost per ton of steel they produced), but they could profitably be built much smaller. And the scrap steel they required was widely available thanks to the previous transition to the BOF, which used much less scrap than the open hearth it replaced.</p><p>Because scrap steel was often contaminated with other metals such as copper that couldn’t be easily separated, minimill steel was initially lower quality than BOF steel, and minimills were only competitive in products where such quality didn’t matter, like concrete reinforcing steel. But as minimill technology improved, they began to take more and more share from large, integrated steelmakers like US Steel. Between 1974 and 1994 steelmaking capacity of integrated producers fell by more than 50%, while the capacity of minimills increased by 360%, reaching 30% of American steelmaking capacity.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank"

It cut tens of thousands of jobs and closed dozens of plants, reducing employment from 171,000 in 1979 to less than 21,000 in 1995. It divested many of its auxiliary operations like mines, warehouses, and bridge construction. It abandoned market segments like rebar and heavy structural steel where it couldn’t compete with the minimills, and instead focused on things like sheet steel products (which minimills still had trouble with), concentrating operations in a small number of large plants. By 1985, US Steel had closed more than 150 facilities, and by 1998 its steelmaking capacity was down 71% from its peak in 1973.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F13528ee3-31f2-4990-896b-8b5e2712bb3b_780x298.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F13528ee3-31f2-4990-896b-8b5e2712bb3b_780x298.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F13528ee3-31f2-4990-896b-8b5e2712bb3b_780x298.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F13528ee3-31f2-4990-896b-8b5e2712bb3b_780x298.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F13528ee3-31f2-4990-896b-8b5e2712bb3b_780x298.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F13528ee3-31f2-4990-896b-8b5e2712bb3b_780x298.png" width="780" height="298" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/13528ee3-31f2-4990-896b-8b5e2712bb3b_780x298.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:298,&quot;width&quot;:780,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F13528ee3-31f2-4990-896b-8b5e2712bb3b_780x298.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F13528ee3-31f2-4990-896b-8b5e2712bb3b_780x298.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F13528ee3-31f2-4990-896b-8b5e2712bb3b_780x298.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F13528ee3-31f2-4990-896b-8b5e2712bb3b_780x298.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>(US Steel was far from the only integrated producer that needed to take such drastic steps.

It was created as a fundamentally conservative reaction to the vicissitudes of the steel industry, and this guided its early years and shaped its culture. The economies of scale it achieved were never passed on to the consumer, and instead it used its size to bully other steelmakers and extract money from consumers. When this stopped working, it used its political influence to prevent consumers from buying low-cost foreign steel. Improving the efficiency of its operations was something it did as a last resort when left with no other options.</p><p>The company’s large size made it unwieldy to manage, and it was late to every major advance in steelmaking technology of the last 100 years, from continuous rolling to the basic oxygen furnace to the minimill. When the company did try its hand at technology innovation, it reliably made missteps. In some cases, like with continuous rolling, it gave up too early, while in other cases it spent many years unsuccessfully developing a technology. In the 1950s, for instance, it spent many years trying to develop an alternative to the BOF that blew oxygen in from the side, long after other producers had given up on the technology. And in the 1970s it tried to develop another alternative to the BOF called Q-BOP that likewise didn’t seem to pan out. As far as I can tell, no major steelmaking technology over the last century came out of US Steel.&nbsp;</p><p>The US Steel of today is a far cry from the industrial giant of the 20th century. But being transformed into a lean, competitive company doesn’t seem to have changed its fundamental culture, a company that's content to be a follower, rather than a leader in technological development and pushing the industry forward.</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>
