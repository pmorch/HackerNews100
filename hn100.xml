<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="blog-rich-text"><p>The <code>lotusbail</code> npm package presents itself as a WhatsApp Web API library - a fork of the legitimate <code>@whiskeysockets/baileys</code> package. With over 56,000 downloads and functional code that actually works as advertised, it's the kind of dependency developers install without a second thought. The package has been available on npm for 6 months and is still live at the time of writing.</p><p>Behind that working functionality: sophisticated malware that steals your WhatsApp credentials, intercepts every message, harvests your contacts, installs a persistent backdoor, and encrypts everything before sending it to the threat actor's server.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/689ad8c5d13f40cf59df0e0c/694807a93d3c8c57926db6ed_image%20(18)%20(1).png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Koidex report for lotusbail package</figcaption></figure><p>What gets captured:</p><ul role="list"><li>Authentication tokens and session keys</li><li>Complete message history (past and present)</li><li>Full contact lists with phone numbers</li><li>Media files and documents</li><li>Persistent backdoor access to your WhatsApp account</li></ul><h2>How It Works</h2><h3><strong>The Cover Is Real</strong></h3><p>Most malicious npm packages reveal themselves quickly - they're typosquats, they don't work, or they're obviously sketchy. This one actually functions as a WhatsApp API. It's based on the legitimate Baileys library and provides real, working functionality for sending and receiving WhatsApp messages.</p><p>Obvious malware is easy to spot. Functional malware? That gets installed, tested, approved, and deployed to production.</p><p>The social engineering here is brilliant: developers don't look for malware in code that works. They look for code that breaks.</p><h3><strong>The Theft and Exfiltration</strong></h3><p>The package wraps the legitimate WebSocket client that communicates with WhatsApp. Every message that flows through your application passes through the malware's socket wrapper first.</p><p>When you authenticate, the wrapper captures your credentials. When messages arrive, it intercepts them. When you send messages, it records them. The legitimate functionality continues working normally - the malware just adds a second recipient for everything.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/689ad8c5d13f40cf59df0e0c/6948073a4954450257af43cd_a29cc381.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>All your WhatsApp authentication tokens, every message sent or received, complete contact lists, media files - everything that passes through the API gets duplicated and prepared for exfiltration.</p><p>But the stolen data doesn't get sent in plain text. The malware includes a complete, custom RSA implementation for encrypting the data before transmission:</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/689ad8c5d13f40cf59df0e0c/6948073a4954450257af43d0_d6657ad0.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Why implement custom RSA? Because legitimate WhatsApp libraries don't need custom encryption - WhatsApp already handles end-to-end encryption. The custom crypto exists for one reason: to encrypt stolen data before exfiltration so network monitoring won't catch it.</p><p>The exfiltration server URL is buried in encrypted configuration strings, hidden inside compressed payloads. The malware uses four layers of obfuscation: Unicode variable manipulation, LZString compression, Base-91 encoding, and AES encryption. The server location isn't hardcoded anywhere visible.</p><h3><strong>The Backdoor</strong></h3><p>Here's where it gets particularly nasty. WhatsApp uses pairing codes to link new devices to accounts. You request a code, WhatsApp generates a random 8-character string, you enter it on your new device, and the devices link together.</p><p>The malware hijacks this process with a hardcoded pairing code. The code is encrypted with AES and hidden in the package:</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/689ad8c5d13f40cf59df0e0c/6948073a4954450257af43d6_7375538c.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>This means the threat actor has a key to your WhatsApp account. When you use this library to authenticate, you're not just linking your application - you're also linking the threat actor's device. They have complete, persistent access to your WhatsApp account, and you have no idea they're there.</p><p>The threat actor can read all your messages, send messages as you, download your media, access your contacts - full account control. And here's the critical part, uninstalling the npm package removes the malicious code, but the threat actor's device stays linked to your WhatsApp account. The pairing persists in WhatsApp's systems until you manually unlink all devices from your WhatsApp settings. Even after the package is gone, they still have access.</p><h2>They Really Didn't Want You Looking</h2><p>The package includes 27 infinite loop traps that freeze execution if debugging tools are detected:</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/689ad8c5d13f40cf59df0e0c/6948073a4954450257af43d3_354957b5.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>These traps check for debuggers, inspect process arguments, detect sandbox environments, and generally make dynamic analysis painful. They also left helpful comments in their code marking the malicious sections - professional development practices applied to supply chain attacks. Someone probably has a Jira board for this.</p><h2>Final Thoughts</h2><p>Supply chain attacks aren't slowing down - they're getting better. We're seeing working code with sophisticated anti-debugging, custom encryption, and multi-layer obfuscation that survives marketplace reviews. The <code>lotusbail</code> case isn't an outlier. It's a preview.</p><p>Traditional security doesn't catch this. Static analysis sees working WhatsApp code and approves it. Reputation systems see 56,000 downloads and trust it. The malware hides in the gap between "this code works" and "this code only does what it claims."</p><p>Catching sophisticated supply chain attacks requires behavioral analysis - watching what packages actually do at runtime. When a WhatsApp library implements custom RSA encryption and includes 27 anti-debugging traps, those are signals. But you need systems watching for them.</p><p>This writeup was authored by the research team at Koi Security. We built Koi to detect threats that pass traditional checks but exhibit malicious behavior at runtime.</p><p><a href="https://www.koi.ai/get-a-demo"><strong>Book a demo</strong></a> to see how behavioral analysis catches what static review misses.</p><p>Stay safe out there.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post">


<p>It's not the 1980s anymore, thankfully.</p>

<p>The first thing I check when debugging latency issues in distributed systems is whether <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/7/tcp">TCP_NODELAY</a> is enabled. And it’s not just me. Every distributed system builder I know has lost hours to latency issues quickly fixed by enabling this simple socket option, suggesting that the default behavior is wrong, and perhaps that the whole concept is outmoded.</p>

<p>First, let’s be clear about what we’re talking about. There’s no better source than John Nagle’s <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc896">RFC896</a> from 1984<sup><a href="#foot1">1</a></sup>. First, the problem statement:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is a special problem associated with small  packets.   When TCP  is  used  for  the transmission of single-character messages originating at a keyboard, the typical result  is  that  41  byte packets (one  byte  of data, 40 bytes of header) are transmitted for each byte of useful data.  This 4000%  overhead  is  annoying but tolerable on lightly loaded networks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In short, Nagle was interested in better amortizing the cost of TCP headers, to get better throughput out of the network. Up to 40x better throughput! These tiny packets had two main causes: human-interactive applications like shells, where folks were typing a byte at a time, and poorly implemented programs that dribbled messages out to the kernel through many <code>write</code> calls. Nagle’s proposal for fixing this was simple and smart:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A  simple and elegant solution has been discovered.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The solution is to inhibit the sending of new TCP  segments  when new  outgoing  data  arrives  from  the  user  if  any previously transmitted data on the connection remains unacknowledged.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When many people talk about Nagle’s algorithm, they talk about timers, but RFC896 doesn’t use any kind of timer other than the round-trip time on the network.</p>

<p><em>Nagle’s Algorithm and Delayed Acks</em></p>

<p>Nagle’s nice, clean, proposal interacted poorly with another TCP feature: delayed <code>ACK</code>. The idea behind delayed <code>ACK</code> is to delay sending the acknowledgement of a packet at least until there’s some data to send back (e.g. a <code>telnet</code> session echoing back the user’s typing), or until a timer expires. <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc813">RFC813</a> from 1982 is that first that seems to propose delaying <code>ACKs</code>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The receiver of data will   refrain   from   sending   an   acknowledgement   under   certain circumstances, in which case it must set a timer which  will  cause  the acknowledgement  to be sent later.  However, the receiver should do this only where it is a reasonable guess that some other event will intervene and prevent the necessity of the timer  interrupt.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>which is then formalized further in <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1122">RFC1122</a> from 1989. The interaction between these two features causes a problem: Nagle’s algorithm is blocking sending more data until an <code>ACK</code> is received, but delayed ack is delaying that <code>ack</code> until a response is ready. Great for keeping packets full, not so great for latency-sensitive pipelined applications.</p>

<p>This is a point Nagle has made himself several times. For example in this <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10608356">Hacker News comment</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>That still irks me. The real problem is not tinygram prevention. It’s ACK delays, and that stupid fixed timer. They both went into TCP around the same time, but independently. I did tinygram prevention (the Nagle algorithm) and Berkeley did delayed ACKs, both in the early 1980s. The combination of the two is awful.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As systems builders this is should be a familiar situation: two reasonable features of the system that interact to create an undesirable behavior. This kind of interaction is one of the things that makes protocol design so hard.</p>

<p><em>Is Nagle blameless?</em></p>

<p>Unfortunately, it’s not just delayed ACK<sup><a href="#foot2">2</a></sup>. Even without delayed ack and that <em>stupid fixed timer</em>, the behavior of Nagle’s algorithm probably isn’t what we want in distributed systems. A single in-datacenter RTT is typically around 500μs, then a couple of milliseconds between datacenters in the same region, and up to hundreds of milliseconds going around the globe. Given the vast amount of work a modern server can do in even a few hundred microseconds, delaying sending data for even one RTT isn’t clearly a win.</p>

<p>To make a clearer case, let’s turn back to the justification behind Nagle’s algorithm: amortizing the cost of headers and avoiding that 40x overhead on single-byte packets. But does anybody send single byte packets anymore? Most distributed databases and systems don’t. Partially that’s because they simply have more to say, partially its because of additional overhead of protocols like TLS, and partially its because of encoding and serialization overhead. But mostly, they have more to say.</p>

<p>The core concern of not sending tiny messages is still a very real one, but we’ve very effectively pushed that into the application layer. Sending a byte at a time wrapped in JSON isn’t going to be very efficient, no matter what Nagle’s algorithm does.</p>

<p><em>Is Nagle needed?</em></p>

<p>First, the uncontroversial take: if you’re building a latency-sensitive distributed system running on modern datacenter-class hardware, enable <code>TCP_NODELAY</code> (disable Nagle’s algorithm) without worries. You don’t need to feel bad. It’s not a sin. It’s OK. Just go ahead.</p>

<p>More controversially, I suspect that Nagle’s algorithm just isn’t needed on modern systems, given the traffic and application mix, and the capabilities of the hardware we have today. In other words, <code>TCP_NODELAY</code> should be the default. That’s going to make some “<code>write</code> every byte” code slower than it would otherwise be, but those applications should be fixed anyway if we care about efficiency.</p>

<p><em>Footnotes</em></p>

<ol>
  <li><a name="foot1"></a> I won’t got into it here, but RFC896 is also one of the earliest statements I can find of metastable behavior in computer networks. In it, Nagle says: “This condition is stable. Once the  saturation point has been reached, if the algorithm for selecting packets to be dropped is fair, the network will continue to operate in a degraded condition.”</li>
  <li><a name="foot2"></a> As this has gone around the internet, a number of folks have asked about <code>TCP_QUICKACK</code>. I don’t tend to reach for it for a few reasons, including lack of portability, and weird semantics (seriously, read <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/7/tcp">the man page</a>). The bigger problem is that <code>TCP_QUICKACK</code> doesn’t fix the fundamental problem of the kernel hanging on to data longer than my program wants it to. When I say <code>write()</code>, I mean <code>write()</code>.</li>
</ol>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>HistoSonics’ Edison system uses a water-filled membrane to transmit focused ultrasound into the body. The resulting bubbles expand and collapse within the tumor, producing mechanical stress that destroys cancer cells and liquefies the tumor.</p><div data-headline="Ultrasound Treatment Takes on Cancer’s Toughest Tumors"><p><strong>For many years,</strong> doctors and technicians who performed medical <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/focused-ultrasound-stimulation-inflammation-diabetes" target="_blank">ultrasound</a> procedures viewed bubbles with wary concern. The phenomenon of cavitation—the formation and collapse of tiny gas bubbles due to changes in pressure—was considered an undesirable and largely uncontrollable side effect. But in 2001, researchers at the University of Michigan began exploring ways to harness the phenomenon for the destruction of cancerous tumors and other problematic tissue.</p><p>The trouble was, creating and controlling cavitation generated heat, which harmed healthy tissue beyond the target area. <a href="https://bme.umich.edu/people/xu-zhen/" target="_blank">Zhen Xu</a>, who was working on a Ph.D. in <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/biomedical-engineering">biomedical engineering</a> at the time, was bombarding pig heart tissue in a tank of water with <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/ultrasound">ultrasound</a> when she made a breakthrough.</p><p>The key was using extremely powerful ultrasound to produce negative pressure of more than 20 megapascals, delivered in short bursts measured in microseconds—but separated by relatively long gaps, between a millisecond and a full second long. These parameters created bubbles that quickly formed and collapsed, tearing apart nearby cells and turning the tissue into a kind of slurry, while avoiding heat buildup. The result was a form of incisionless <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/surgery">surgery</a>, a way to wipe out tumors without scalpels, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/radiation">radiation</a>, or heat.</p><p>“The experiments worked,” says Xu, now a professor at Michigan, “but I also destroyed the ultrasound equipment that I used,” which was the most powerful available at the time. In 2009, she cofounded a company, <a href="https://histosonics.com/" target="_blank">HistoSonics</a>, to commercialize more powerful ultrasound machines, test treatment of a variety of diseases, and make the procedure, called histotripsy, widely available.</p><p>So far, the killer app is fighting <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/cancer" target="_blank">cancer</a>. In 2023, HistoSonics’ Edison system received <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/fda">FDA</a> approval for <a href="https://histosonics.com/news/fda-awards-histosonics-clearance-of-its-first-of-a-kind-edison-histotripsy-system-2/" target="_blank">treatment of liver tumors</a>. In 2026, clinicians will conclude a <a href="https://histosonics.com/news/worlds-first-kidney-tumor-treated-using-the-histosonics-edison-histotripsy-system/" target="_blank">pivotal kidney cancer study</a> and apply for regulatory approval. They’ll also launch a large-scale pivotal trial for pancreatic <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/cancer">cancer</a>, considered one of the deadliest forms of the disease with a five-year survival rate of just <a href="https://pancan.org/press-releases/pancreatic-cancer-diagnoses-and-mortality-rates-climb-five-year-survival-rate-for-pancreatic-cancer-stalls-at-13/" target="_blank">13 percent</a>. An effective treatment for pancreatic cancer would represent a major advance against one of the most lethal malignancies.</p><h2>Histotripsy’s Benefits for Cancer Treatment</h2><p>HistoSonics is not the only developer of histotripsy devices or techniques, but it is first to market with a purpose-built device. “What HistoSonics has developed is a symphony of technologies, which combines physics, biology, and biomedical engineering,” says <a href="https://www.cc.nih.gov/meet-our-doctors/bwood" target="_blank">Bradford Wood</a>, an interventional radiologist at the National Institutes of Health, who is not affiliated with the company. Its engineering effort has spanned multiple disciplines to produce robotic, computer-guided systems that turn physical forces into therapeutic effects.</p><p>Over the past decade, research has confirmed or found other benefits of histotripsy. With precise calibration, fibrous tissue—such as blood vessels—can be spared from damage even in the target zone. And while other noninvasive techniques may leave scar tissue, the liquefied debris created by histotripsy is cleared away by the body’s natural processes.</p><p>In HistoSonics’ early trials for pancreatic cancer, doctors used <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/focused-ultrasound">focused ultrasound</a> pulses to ablate, or destroy, tumors deep within the pancreas. “It’s a great achievement for the entire field to show that it is possible to ablate pancreatic tumors and that it’s well tolerated,” says <a href="https://gastro.uw.edu/people/faculty/khokhlova-t" target="_blank">Tatiana Khokhlova</a>, a medical ultrasound researcher at the University of Washington, in Seattle, who has worked on alternative histotripsy techniques.</p><p>Khokhlova says the key to harnessing histotripsy’s benefits “will be combining ablation of the primary tumor in the pancreas with some other therapy.” Combination treatment could fight recurrent cancer and tiny tumors that ultrasound might miss, while also tapping into a surprising benefit.</p><p>Histotripsy generally seems to <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31940590/" target="_blank">stimulate an immune response</a>, helping the body attack cancer cells that weren’t targeted directly by ultrasound. The mechanical destruction of tumors likely leaves behind recognizable traces of cancer proteins that help the immune system learn to identify and destroy similar cells elsewhere in the body, explains Wood. Researchers are now exploring ways to pair histotripsy with immunotherapy to amplify that effect.</p><p>The company’s capacity to explore the treatment‘s potential for different conditions will only improve with time, says HistoSonics CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mike-blue-860b9522/" target="_blank">Mike Blue</a>. The company has fresh resources to accelerate R&amp;D: A new ownership group, which includes billionaire <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/jeff-bezos">Jeff Bezos</a>, <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250807749442/en/HistoSonics-Announces-%242.25B-Acquisition-by-Consortium-of-Top-Tier-Investors" target="_blank">acquired</a> HistoSonics in August 2025 at a valuation of US $2.25 billion. </p><p>Engineers are already testing a new guidance system that uses a form of <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/x-rays">X-rays</a> rather than <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/ultrasound-imaging">ultrasound imaging</a>, which should expand use cases. The R&amp;D team is also developing a feedback system that analyzes echoes from the therapeutic ultrasound to detect tissue destruction and integrates that information into the live display, says Blue.</p><p>If those advances pan out, histotripsy could move well beyond the liver, kidney, and pancreas in the fight against cancer. What started as a curiosity about bubbles might soon become a new pillar of noninvasive medicine—a future in which surgeons wield not scalpels, but sound waves.</p></div></div>]]></description>

          <p>On Monday, the US Department of the Interior <a href="https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/trump-administration-protects-us-national-security-pausing-offshore-wind-leases">announced</a> that it was pausing the leases on all five offshore wind sites currently under construction in the US. The move comes despite the fact that these projects already have installed significant hardware in the water and on land; one of them is nearly complete. In what appears to be an attempt to avoid legal scrutiny, the Interior is blaming the decisions on a classified report from the Department of Defense.</p>
<p>The second Trump administration announced its animosity toward offshore wind power <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/temporary-withdrawal-of-all-areas-on-the-outer-continental-shelf-from-offshore-wind-leasing-and-review-of-the-federal-governments-leasing-and-permitting-practices-for-wind-projects/">literally on day one</a>, issuing an executive order on inauguration day that called for a temporary halt to issuing permits for new projects pending a re-evaluation. Earlier this month, however, a judge <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/trumps-order-blocking-wind-development-thrown-out-by-court/">vacated that executive order</a>, noting that the government has shown no indication that it was even attempting to start the re-evaluation it said was needed.</p>
<p>But a number of projects have gone through the entire permitting process, and construction has started. Before today, the administration had attempted to stop these in an erratic, halting manner. Empire Wind, an 800 MW farm being built off New York, was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/us-interior-secretary-orders-offshore-wind-project-shut-down/">stopped by the Department of the Interior</a>, which alleged that it had been rushed through permitting. That <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/09/judge-lets-construction-on-an-offshore-wind-farm-resume/">hold was lifted</a> following lobbying and negotiations by New York and the project developer Orsted, and the Department of the Interior never revealed why it changed its mind. When the Interior Department blocked a second Orsted project, Revolution Wind offshore of southern New England, the company took the government to court and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/09/judge-lets-construction-on-an-offshore-wind-farm-resume/">won a ruling</a> that let it continue construction.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Today’s announcement targets those and three other projects. Interior says it is pausing the permits for all five, which are the only projects currently under construction. It claims that offshore wind creates “national security risks” that were revealed in a recent analysis performed by the Department of Defense, which apparently neglected to identify these issues during the evaluations it did while the projects were first permitted.</p>
<h2>Unspecified risks</h2>
<p>What are these risks? The Interior Department is being extremely coy. It notes that offshore wind turbines can interfere with radar sensing, but that’s been known for a while. In announcing the decision, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum also noted “the rapid evolution of the relevant adversary technologies.” But the announcement says that the Defense Department analysis is classified, meaning nobody is likely to know what the actual reason is—presuming one exists. The classification will also make it far more challenging to contest this decision in court.</p>
<p>The five blocked projects&nbsp; are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind: A massive 2.6 GW installation off the coast of Virginia. According to the <a href="https://coastalvawind.com/about/the-project/timeline#tl2024">project’s updates</a>, construction of the land-based facilities and the in-water base for the towers is complete, and assembly of the turbines and towers on land has started.</li>
<li>Empire Wind: A site off the New York/New Jersey coast will play host to an 810 MW project. This one is early in the construction phase, with work focusing on prepping the sites where turbines will be installed. This had been subjected to an earlier hold.</li>
<li>Revolution Wind: Another early victim of the Department of Interior’s capricious early attempts, Revolution was 80 percent complete when work restarted following Orsted’s court victory. It will host 700 MW of generating capacity in the waters off Connecticut and Rhode Island.</li>
<li>Sunrise Wind: 925 MW is planned for a site beyond the tip of Long Island. Recent construction updates suggest that work is primarily focused on the facilities where power will be brought ashore.</li>
<li>Vineyard Wind 1: This is an 800 MW project being built just south of Nantucket and Martha’s Vineyard. This project was expected to be completed by the end of this year, so it may be substantially done.</li>
</ul>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>Many of the affected states were counting on the power that these facilities would deliver, and will likely oppose this move. “This appears to be a second, even more lawless and erratic stop work order, reviving the Trump Administration’s prior failed attempt to halt construction of Revolution Wind,” said William Tong, the Attorney General of Connecticut. “There is a court order blocking their prior stop work order and this appears to be a new brazen attempt to circumvent that order.” He indicated his office is currently evaluating its legal options.</p>
<p>The states are likely to be joined by the companies backing these projects, which, in several cases, have already spent nearly all the money needed for their construction and will be eager to start earning that back by selling power from the facilities.</p>
<p>In both court cases in which the administration attempted to block wind power development, the government lost badly. The records in the case indicate that it has had no substantive reasons for reversing decades-old policies and overruling past decisions, and that internally, the decision-making process appears to consist entirely of noting that the president doesn’t like wind power. It’s unclear whether this classified evaluation differs significantly from earlier efforts in any way other than that it will be harder to find out.</p>

<p>In the <a href="https://jalammar.github.io/visualizing-neural-machine-translation-mechanics-of-seq2seq-models-with-attention/">previous post, we looked at Attention</a> – a ubiquitous method in modern deep learning models. Attention is a concept that helped improve the performance of neural machine translation applications. In this post, we will look at <strong>The Transformer</strong> – a model that uses attention to boost the speed with which these models can be trained. The Transformer outperforms the Google Neural Machine Translation model in specific tasks. The biggest benefit, however, comes from how The Transformer lends itself to parallelization. It is in fact Google Cloud’s recommendation to use The Transformer as a reference model to use their <a href="https://cloud.google.com/tpu/">Cloud TPU</a> offering. So let’s try to break the model apart and look at how it functions.</p>

<p>The Transformer was proposed in the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762">Attention is All You Need</a>. A TensorFlow implementation of it is available as a part of the <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensor2tensor">Tensor2Tensor</a> package. Harvard’s NLP group created a <a href="http://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/2018/04/03/attention.html">guide annotating the paper with PyTorch implementation</a>. In this post, we will attempt to oversimplify things a bit and introduce the concepts one by one to hopefully make it easier to understand to people without in-depth knowledge of the subject matter.</p>

<p><strong>2025 Update</strong>: We’ve built a <a href="https://bit.ly/4aRnn7Z">free short course</a> that brings the contents of this post up-to-date with animations:</p>

</p>
<h2 id="a-high-level-look">A High-Level Look</h2>
<p>Let’s begin by looking at the model as a single black box. In a machine translation application, it would take a sentence in one language, and output its translation in another.</p>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/the_transformer_3.png">

<p>Popping open that Optimus Prime goodness, we see an encoding component, a decoding component, and connections between them.</p>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/The_transformer_encoders_decoders.png">
</p>

<p>The encoding component is a stack of encoders (the paper stacks six of them on top of each other – there’s nothing magical about the number six, one can definitely experiment with other arrangements). The decoding component is a stack of decoders of the same number.</p>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/The_transformer_encoder_decoder_stack.png">
</p>

<p>The encoders are all identical in structure (yet they do not share weights). Each one is broken down into two sub-layers:</p>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/Transformer_encoder.png">
</p>

<p>The encoder’s inputs first flow through a self-attention layer – a layer that helps the encoder look at other words in the input sentence as it encodes a specific word. We’ll look closer at self-attention later in the post.</p>

<p>The outputs of the self-attention layer are fed to a feed-forward neural network. The exact same feed-forward network is independently applied to each position.</p>

<p>The decoder has both those layers, but between them is an attention layer that helps the decoder focus on relevant parts of the input sentence (similar what attention does in <a href="https://jalammar.github.io/visualizing-neural-machine-translation-mechanics-of-seq2seq-models-with-attention/">seq2seq models</a>).</p>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/Transformer_decoder.png">
</p>

<h2 id="bringing-the-tensors-into-the-picture">Bringing The Tensors Into The Picture</h2>

<p>Now that we’ve seen the major components of the model, let’s start to look at the various vectors/tensors and how they flow between these components to turn the input of a trained model into an output.</p>

<p>As is the case in NLP applications in general, we begin by turning each input word into a vector using an <a href="https://medium.com/deeper-learning/glossary-of-deep-learning-word-embedding-f90c3cec34ca">embedding algorithm</a>.</p>



<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/embeddings.png">
  <br>
  Each word is embedded into a vector of size 512. We'll represent those vectors with these simple boxes.
</p>

<p>The embedding only happens in the bottom-most encoder. The abstraction that is common to all the encoders is that they receive a list of vectors each of the size 512 – In the bottom encoder that would be the word embeddings, but in other encoders, it would be the output of the encoder that’s directly below. The size of this list is hyperparameter we can set – basically it would be the length of the longest sentence in our training dataset.</p>

<p>After embedding the words in our input sequence, each of them flows through each of the two layers of the encoder.</p>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/encoder_with_tensors.png">
  <br>

</p>

<p>Here we begin to see one key property of the Transformer, which is that the word in each position flows through its own path in the encoder. There are dependencies between these paths in the self-attention layer. The feed-forward layer does not have those dependencies, however, and thus the various paths can be executed in parallel while flowing through the feed-forward layer.</p>

<p>Next, we’ll switch up the example to a shorter sentence and we’ll look at what happens in each sub-layer of the encoder.</p>

<h2 id="now-were-encoding">Now We’re Encoding!</h2>

<p>As we’ve mentioned already, an encoder receives a list of vectors as input. It processes this list by passing these vectors into a ‘self-attention’ layer, then into a feed-forward neural network, then sends out the output upwards to the next encoder.</p>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/encoder_with_tensors_2.png">
  <br>
  The word at each position passes through a self-attention process. Then, they each pass through a feed-forward neural network -- the exact same network with each vector flowing through it separately.
</p>

<h2 id="self-attention-at-a-high-level">Self-Attention at a High Level</h2>
<p>Don’t be fooled by me throwing around the word “self-attention” like it’s a concept everyone should be familiar with. I had personally never came across the concept until reading the Attention is All You Need paper. Let us distill how it works.</p>

<p>Say the following sentence is an input sentence we want to translate:</p>

<p>”<code>The animal didn't cross the street because it was too tired</code>”</p>

<p>What does “it” in this sentence refer to? Is it referring to the street or to the animal? It’s a simple question to a human, but not as simple to an algorithm.</p>

<p>When the model is processing the word “it”, self-attention allows it to associate “it” with “animal”.</p>

<p>As the model processes each word (each position in the input sequence), self attention allows it to look at other positions in the input sequence for clues that can help lead to a better encoding for this word.</p>

<p>If you’re familiar with RNNs, think of how maintaining a hidden state allows an RNN to incorporate its representation of previous words/vectors it has processed with the current one it’s processing. Self-attention is the method the Transformer uses to bake the “understanding” of other relevant words into the one we’re currently processing.</p>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_self-attention_visualization.png">
  <br>
  As we are encoding the word "it" in encoder #5 (the top encoder in the stack), part of the attention mechanism was focusing on "The Animal", and baked a part of its representation into the encoding of "it".
</p>

<p>Be sure to check out the <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/tensor2tensor/blob/master/tensor2tensor/notebooks/hello_t2t.ipynb">Tensor2Tensor notebook</a> where you can load a Transformer model, and examine it using this interactive visualization.</p>

<h2 id="self-attention-in-detail">Self-Attention in Detail</h2>
<p>Let’s first look at how to calculate self-attention using vectors, then proceed to look at how it’s actually implemented – using matrices.</p>

<p>The <strong>first step</strong> in calculating self-attention is to create three vectors from each of the encoder’s input vectors (in this case, the embedding of each word). So for each word, we create a Query vector, a Key vector, and a Value vector. These vectors are created by multiplying the embedding by three matrices that we trained during the training process.</p>

<p>Notice that these new vectors are smaller in dimension than the embedding vector. Their dimensionality is 64, while the embedding and encoder input/output vectors have dimensionality of 512. They don’t HAVE to be smaller, this is an architecture choice to make the computation of multiheaded attention (mostly) constant.</p>



<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_self_attention_vectors.png">
  <br>
  Multiplying <span>x1</span> by the <span>WQ</span> weight matrix produces <span>q1</span>, the "query" vector associated with that word. We end up creating a "query", a "key", and a "value" projection of each word in the input sentence.
</p>



<div><p>What are the “query”, “key”, and “value” vectors?
</p><p>

They’re abstractions that are useful for calculating and thinking about attention. Once you proceed with reading how attention is calculated below, you’ll know pretty much all you need to know about the role each of these vectors plays.</p></div>

<p>The <strong>second step</strong> in calculating self-attention is to calculate a score. Say we’re calculating the self-attention for the first word in this example, “Thinking”. We need to score each word of the input sentence against this word. The score determines how much focus to place on other parts of the input sentence as we encode a word at a certain position.</p>

<p>The score is calculated by taking the dot product of the <span>query vector</span> with the <span>key vector</span> of the respective word we’re scoring. So if we’re processing the self-attention for the word in position <span>#1</span>, the first score would be the dot product of <span>q1</span> and <span>k1</span>. The second score would be the dot product of <span>q1</span> and <span>k2</span>.</p>



<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_self_attention_score.png">
  <br>

</p>



<p>The <strong>third and fourth steps</strong> are to divide the scores by 8 (the square root of the dimension of the key vectors used in the paper – 64. This leads to having more stable gradients. There could be other possible values here, but this is the default), then pass the result through a softmax operation. Softmax normalizes the scores so they’re all positive and add up to 1.</p>



<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/self-attention_softmax.png">
  <br>

</p>

<p>This softmax score determines how much each word will be expressed at this position. Clearly the word at this position will have the highest softmax score, but sometimes it’s useful to attend to another word that is relevant to the current word.</p>



<p>The <strong>fifth step</strong> is to multiply each value vector by the softmax score (in preparation to sum them up). The intuition here is to keep intact the values of the word(s) we want to focus on, and drown-out irrelevant words (by multiplying them by tiny numbers like 0.001, for example).</p>

<p>The <strong>sixth step</strong> is to sum up the weighted value vectors. This produces the output of the self-attention layer at this position (for the first word).</p>



<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/self-attention-output.png">
  <br>
</p>

<p>That concludes the self-attention calculation. The resulting vector is one we can send along to the feed-forward neural network. In the actual implementation, however, this calculation is done in matrix form for faster processing. So let’s look at that now that we’ve seen the intuition of the calculation on the word level.</p>

<h2 id="matrix-calculation-of-self-attention">Matrix Calculation of Self-Attention</h2>
<p><strong>The first step</strong> is to calculate the Query, Key, and Value matrices. We do that by packing our embeddings into a matrix <span>X</span>, and multiplying it by the weight matrices we’ve trained (<span>WQ</span>, <span>WK</span>, <span>WV</span>).</p>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/self-attention-matrix-calculation.png">
  <br>
  Every row in the <span>X</span> matrix corresponds to a word in the input sentence. We again see the difference in size of the embedding vector (512, or 4 boxes in the figure), and the q/k/v vectors (64, or 3 boxes in the figure)
</p>



<p><strong>Finally</strong>, since we’re dealing with matrices, we can condense steps two through six in one formula to calculate the outputs of the self-attention layer.</p>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/self-attention-matrix-calculation-2.png">
  <br>
  The self-attention calculation in matrix form
</p>





<h2 id="the-beast-with-many-heads">The Beast With Many Heads</h2>

<p>The paper further refined the self-attention layer by adding a mechanism called “multi-headed” attention. This improves the performance of the attention layer in two ways:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>It expands the model’s ability to focus on different positions. Yes, in the example above, z1 contains a little bit of every other encoding, but it could be dominated by the actual word itself. If we’re translating a sentence like “The animal didn’t cross the street because it was too tired”, it would be useful to know which word “it” refers to.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It gives the attention layer multiple “representation subspaces”. As we’ll see next, with multi-headed attention we have not only one, but multiple sets of Query/Key/Value weight matrices (the Transformer uses eight attention heads, so we end up with eight sets for each encoder/decoder). Each of these sets is randomly initialized. Then, after training, each set is used to project the input embeddings (or vectors from lower encoders/decoders) into a different representation subspace.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_attention_heads_qkv.png">
   <br>
   With multi-headed attention, we maintain separate Q/K/V weight matrices for each head resulting in different Q/K/V matrices. As we did before, we multiply X by the WQ/WK/WV matrices to produce Q/K/V matrices.
 </p>

<p><br>
If we do the same self-attention calculation we outlined above, just eight different times with different weight matrices, we end up with eight different Z matrices</p>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_attention_heads_z.png">
  <br>

</p>



<p>This leaves us with a bit of a challenge. The feed-forward layer is not expecting eight matrices – it’s expecting a single matrix (a vector for each word). So we need a way to condense these eight down into a single matrix.</p>

<p>How do we do that? We concat the matrices then multiply them by an additional weights matrix WO.</p>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_attention_heads_weight_matrix_o.png">
  <br>

</p>

<p>That’s pretty much all there is to multi-headed self-attention. It’s quite a handful of matrices, I realize. Let me try to put them all in one visual so we can look at them in one place</p>



<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_multi-headed_self-attention-recap.png">
  <br>

</p>



<p>Now that we have touched upon attention heads, let’s revisit our example from before to see where the different attention heads are focusing as we encode the word “it” in our example sentence:</p>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_self-attention_visualization_2.png">
  <br>
  As we encode the word "it", one attention head is focusing most on "the animal", while another is focusing on "tired" -- in a sense, the model's representation of the word "it" bakes in some of the representation of both "animal" and "tired".
</p>



<p>If we add all the attention heads to the picture, however, things can be harder to interpret:</p>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_self-attention_visualization_3.png">
  <br>
</p>

<h2 id="representing-the-order-of-the-sequence-using-positional-encoding">Representing The Order of The Sequence Using Positional Encoding</h2>
<p>One thing that’s missing from the model as we have described it so far is a way to account for the order of the words in the input sequence.</p>

<p>To address this, the transformer adds a vector to each input embedding. These vectors follow a specific pattern that the model learns, which helps it determine the position of each word, or the distance between different words in the sequence. The intuition here is that adding these values to the embeddings provides meaningful distances between the embedding vectors once they’re projected into Q/K/V vectors and during dot-product attention.</p>



<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_positional_encoding_vectors.png">
  <br>
  To give the model a sense of the order of the words, we add positional encoding vectors -- the values of which follow a specific pattern.
</p>


<p>If we assumed the embedding has a dimensionality of 4, the actual positional encodings would look like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_positional_encoding_example.png">
  <br>
  A real example of positional encoding with a toy embedding size of 4
</p>



<p>What might this pattern look like?</p>

<p>In the following figure, each row corresponds to a positional encoding of a vector. So the first row would be the vector we’d add to the embedding of the first word in an input sequence. Each row contains 512 values – each with a value between 1 and -1. We’ve color-coded them so the pattern is visible.</p>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_positional_encoding_large_example.png">
  <br>
  A real example of positional encoding for 20 words (rows) with an embedding size of 512 (columns). You can see that it appears split in half down the center. That's because the values of the left half are generated by one function (which uses sine), and the right half is generated by another function (which uses cosine). They're then concatenated to form each of the positional encoding vectors.
</p>

<p>The formula for positional encoding is described in the paper (section 3.5). You can see the code for generating positional encodings in <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensor2tensor/blob/23bd23b9830059fbc349381b70d9429b5c40a139/tensor2tensor/layers/common_attention.py"><code>get_timing_signal_1d()</code></a>. This is not the only possible method for positional encoding. It, however, gives the advantage of being able to scale to unseen lengths of sequences (e.g. if our trained model is asked to translate a sentence longer than any of those in our training set).</p>

<p><strong>July 2020 Update:</strong> 
The positional encoding shown above is from the Tensor2Tensor implementation of the Transformer. The method shown in the paper is slightly different in that it doesn’t directly concatenate, but interweaves the two signals. The following figure shows what that looks like. <a href="https://github.com/jalammar/jalammar.github.io/blob/master/notebookes/transformer/transformer_positional_encoding_graph.ipynb">Here’s the code to generate it</a>:</p>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/attention-is-all-you-need-positional-encoding.png">
  <br>
</p>

<h2 id="the-residuals">The Residuals</h2>
<p>One detail in the architecture of the encoder that we need to mention before moving on, is that each sub-layer (self-attention, ffnn) in each encoder has a residual connection around it, and is followed by a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.06450">layer-normalization</a> step.</p>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_resideual_layer_norm.png">
  <br>
</p>

<p>If we’re to visualize the vectors and the layer-norm operation associated with self attention, it would look like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_resideual_layer_norm_2.png">
  <br>
</p>

<p>This goes for the sub-layers of the decoder as well. If we’re to think of a Transformer of 2 stacked encoders and decoders, it would look something like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_resideual_layer_norm_3.png">
  <br>
</p>

<h2 id="the-decoder-side">The Decoder Side</h2>
<p>Now that we’ve covered most of the concepts on the encoder side, we basically know how the components of decoders work as well. But let’s take a look at how they work together.</p>

<p>The encoder start by processing the input sequence. The output of the top encoder is then transformed into a set of attention vectors K and V. These are to be used by each decoder in its “encoder-decoder attention” layer which helps the decoder focus on appropriate places in the input sequence:</p>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_decoding_1.gif">
  <br>
  After finishing the encoding phase, we begin the decoding phase. Each step in the decoding phase outputs an element from the output sequence (the English translation sentence in this case).
</p>

<p>The following steps repeat the process until a special <end of="" sentence=""> symbol is reached indicating the transformer decoder has completed its output. The output of each step is fed to the bottom decoder in the next time step, and the decoders bubble up their decoding results just like the encoders did. And just like we did with the encoder inputs, we embed and add positional encoding to those decoder inputs to indicate the position of each word.</end></p>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_decoding_2.gif">
  <br>

</p>

<p>The self attention layers in the decoder operate in a slightly different way than the one in the encoder:</p>

<p>In the decoder, the self-attention layer is only allowed to attend to earlier positions in the output sequence. This is done by masking future positions (setting them to <code>-inf</code>) before the softmax step in the self-attention calculation.</p>

<p>The “Encoder-Decoder Attention” layer works just like multiheaded self-attention, except it creates its Queries matrix from the layer below it, and takes the Keys and Values matrix from the output of the encoder stack.</p>

<h2 id="the-final-linear-and-softmax-layer">The Final Linear and Softmax Layer</h2>

<p>The decoder stack outputs a vector of floats. How do we turn that into a word? That’s the job of the final Linear layer which is followed by a Softmax Layer.</p>

<p>The Linear layer is a simple fully connected neural network that projects the vector produced by the stack of decoders, into a much, much larger vector called a logits vector.</p>

<p>Let’s assume that our model knows 10,000 unique English words (our model’s “output vocabulary”) that it’s learned from its training dataset. This would make the logits vector 10,000 cells wide – each cell corresponding to the score of a unique word. That is how we interpret the output of the model followed by the Linear layer.</p>

<p>The softmax layer then turns those scores into probabilities (all positive, all add up to 1.0). The cell with the highest probability is chosen, and the word associated with it is produced as the output for this time step.</p>



<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_decoder_output_softmax.png">
  <br>
  This figure starts from the bottom with the vector produced as the output of the decoder stack. It is then turned into an output word.
</p>



<h2 id="recap-of-training">Recap Of Training</h2>
<p>Now that we’ve covered the entire forward-pass process through a trained Transformer, it would be useful to glance at the intuition of training the model.</p>

<p>During training, an untrained model would go through the exact same forward pass. But since we are training it on a labeled training dataset, we can compare its output with the actual correct output.</p>

<p>To visualize this, let’s assume our output vocabulary only contains six words(“a”, “am”, “i”, “thanks”, “student”, and “&lt;eos&gt;” (short for ‘end of sentence’)).</p>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/vocabulary.png">
   <br>
   The output vocabulary of our model is created in the preprocessing phase before we even begin training.
 </p>

<p>Once we define our output vocabulary, we can use a vector of the same width to indicate each word in our vocabulary. This also known as one-hot encoding. So for example, we can indicate the word “am” using the following vector:</p>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/one-hot-vocabulary-example.png">
  <br>
  Example: one-hot encoding of our output vocabulary
</p>

<p>Following this recap, let’s discuss the model’s loss function – the metric we are optimizing during the training phase to lead up to a trained and hopefully amazingly accurate model.</p>

<h2 id="the-loss-function">The Loss Function</h2>
<p>Say we are training our model. Say it’s our first step in the training phase, and we’re training it on a simple example – translating “merci” into “thanks”.</p>

<p>What this means, is that we want the output to be a probability distribution indicating the word “thanks”. But since this model is not yet trained, that’s unlikely to happen just yet.</p>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_logits_output_and_label.png">
  <br>
  Since the model's parameters (weights) are all initialized randomly, the (untrained) model produces a probability distribution with arbitrary values for each cell/word. We can compare it with the actual output, then tweak all the model's weights using backpropagation to make the output closer to the desired output.
</p>



<p>How do you compare two probability distributions? We simply subtract one from the other. For more details, look at  <a href="https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-09-Visual-Information/">cross-entropy</a> and <a href="https://www.countbayesie.com/blog/2017/5/9/kullback-leibler-divergence-explained">Kullback–Leibler divergence</a>.</p>

<p>But note that this is an oversimplified example. More realistically, we’ll use a sentence longer than one word. For example – input: “je suis étudiant” and expected output: “i am a student”. What this really means, is that we want our model to successively output probability distributions where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Each probability distribution is represented by a vector of width vocab_size (6 in our toy example, but more realistically a number like 30,000 or 50,000)</li>
  <li>The first probability distribution has the highest probability at the cell associated with the word “i”</li>
  <li>The second probability distribution has the highest probability at the cell associated with the word “am”</li>
  <li>And so on, until the fifth output distribution indicates ‘<code>&lt;end of sentence&gt;</code>’ symbol, which also has a cell associated with it from the 10,000 element vocabulary.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/output_target_probability_distributions.png">
   <br>
   The targeted probability distributions we'll train our model against in the training example for one sample sentence.
 </p>



<p>After training the model for enough time on a large enough dataset, we would hope the produced probability distributions would look like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/output_trained_model_probability_distributions.png">
    <br>
    Hopefully upon training, the model would output the right translation we expect. Of course it's no real indication if this phrase was part of the training dataset (see: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIgfjmp-4BA">cross validation</a>). Notice that every position gets a little bit of probability even if it's unlikely to be the output of that time step -- that's a very useful property of softmax which helps the training process.
</p>

<p>Now, because the model produces the outputs one at a time, we can assume that the model is selecting the word with the highest probability from that probability distribution and throwing away the rest. That’s one way to do it (called greedy decoding). Another way to do it would be to hold on to, say, the top two words (say, ‘I’ and ‘a’ for example), then in the next step, run the model twice: once assuming the first output position was the word ‘I’, and another time assuming the first output position was the word ‘a’, and whichever version produced less error considering both positions #1 and #2 is kept. We repeat this for positions #2 and #3…etc. This method is called “beam search”, where in our example, beam_size was two (meaning that at all times, two partial hypotheses (unfinished translations) are kept in memory), and top_beams is also two (meaning we’ll return two translations). These are both hyperparameters that you can experiment with.</p>

	<div>
							<p><span>There are many interesting tidbits about the life of the political prisoner Jimmy Lai. He hid in the bottom of a fishing boat to escape mainland Communist China for Hong Kong at the ripe age of 12. He built a garment empire after spending his adolescence working, and sleeping, in garment factories. Without media experience, he started several successful news ventures—most notably the plucky and irreverent </span><i><span>Apple Daily</span></i><span>—which forcefully advocated for democracy and free speech. And he may be sentenced to die in prison in connection with his efforts promoting liberty in China.</span></p>
<p><span>But the most interesting fact, by far, is that Lai is a citizen of the United Kingdom (U.K.).</span></p>
<p><span>The dissident was convicted in Hong Kong earlier this week of two counts of conspiring to collude with foreign forces and one count of publishing seditious material—charges stemming from his crusade against illiberalism, a fight he has been waging for decades. Lai finding himself in trouble was not a surprise. That's especially true amid the backdrop of Hong Kong's "national security" law, which sought to cripple dissent, that took effect in 2020. He was arrested in August of that year and released on bail; authorities revoked it four months later. Lai has been in custody since.</span></p>
<p><span>That he would probably end up in prison, however, was never </span><i><span>really</span></i><span> in doubt. Which brings me back to his U.K. citizenship.</span></p>
<p><span>Lai did not have to stay in Hong Kong as the walls closed in on him. The self-made business tycoon—once a billionaire before the government froze his assets—could have fled to a residence abroad. His friend Mark Clifford, formerly the editor in chief of the </span><i><span>South China Morning Post, </span></i><span>told me in an </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiIc-HEpO6k"><span>interview</span></a><span> earlier this year that many people in Lai's circle urged him to do just that.</span></p>
<p><span>He declined. "Everything I have was given to me by Hong Kong. I won't be leaving," Lai </span><a href="https://www.rfa.org/english/news/china/hongkong-jimmylai-06102020163836.html"><span>told</span></a><span> Radio Free Asia in June 2020. "I'm going to stay here and fight to the bitter end."</span></p>
<p>Lawmakers would go on to formally approve the national security law, essentially a foregone conclusion, about three weeks later. The legislation broadly criminalized political dissent and hamstrung the civil liberties that once distinguished Hong Kong from mainland China. A defense of those freedoms—which were already under increasing attack—had come to define Lai's legacy. Lai not only unapologetically advanced democracy and free expression in the region, but he also met with then–Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo; at trial, Lai <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/rcna180929">testified</a> that he had asked them to voice their support for Hong Kong. He knew the law was coming, and he knew what it meant for him.</p>
<p><span>But some things, he decided, are more important than personal freedom. In this case, the absence of it was more important—in part to show the world what happens when an authoritarian government severely curtails basic liberties.</span></p>
<p><span>In some sense, there was no better person than Lai to send this message. His Cinderella story is impossible to divorce from Hong Kong itself. There, he was able to find refuge from the Chinese Communist Party, which had imprisoned his mother, deemed a "class enemy," in a labor camp. But he was also able to make something from nothing: from living in factories, while </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/28/opinion/hongkong-china-lai-democracy.html"><span>rats scampered across his body</span></a><span>, to running them. His story came full circle. It demands people ask: Do you prefer Hong Kong's past? Or its future?</span></p>

  <p>I am standing on the corner of Harris Road and Young Street outside of the Crossroads Business Park in Bakersfield, California, looking up at a Flock surveillance camera bolted high above a traffic signal. On my phone, I am watching myself in real time as the camera records and livestreams me—without any password or login—to the open internet. I wander into the intersection, stare at the camera and wave. On the livestream, I can see myself clearly. Hundreds of miles away, my colleagues are remotely watching me too through the exposed feed.</p><p>Flock left livestreams and administrator control panels for at least 60 of its AI-enabled Condor cameras around the country exposed to the open internet, where anyone could watch them, download 30 days worth of video archive, and change settings, see log files, and run diagnostics.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://www.404media.co/content/images/2025/12/CleanShot-2025-12-22-at-07.28.53@2x.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1074" srcset="https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w600/2025/12/CleanShot-2025-12-22-at-07.28.53@2x.png 600w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w1000/2025/12/CleanShot-2025-12-22-at-07.28.53@2x.png 1000w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w1600/2025/12/CleanShot-2025-12-22-at-07.28.53@2x.png 1600w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w2400/2025/12/CleanShot-2025-12-22-at-07.28.53@2x.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Unlike many of Flock’s cameras, which are designed to capture license plates as people drive by, Flock’s Condor cameras are pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) cameras designed to record and track people, not vehicles. Condor cameras can be set to automatically zoom in on people’s faces as they walk through a parking lot, down a public street, or play on a playground, or they can be controlled manually, according to marketing material on Flock’s website. We watched Condor cameras zoom in on a woman walking her dog on a bike path in suburban Atlanta; a camera followed a man walking through a Macy’s parking lot in Bakersfield; surveil children swinging on a swingset at a playground; and film high-res video of people sitting at a stoplight in traffic. In one case, we were able to watch a man rollerblade down Brookhaven, Georgia’s Peachtree Creek Greenway bike path. The Flock camera zoomed in on him and tracked him as he rolled past. Minutes later, he showed up on another exposed camera livestream further down the bike path. The camera’s resolution was good enough that we were able to see that, when he stopped beneath one of the cameras, he was watching rollerblading videos on his phone.</p><figure data-kg-thumbnail="https://www.404media.co/content/media/2025/12/1222--1-_thumb.jpg" data-kg-custom-thumbnail="">

        <img src="https://www.404media.co/content/media/2025/12/1222--1-_thumb.jpg"></figure><p>The exposure was initially discovered by YouTuber and technologist Benn Jordan and was shared with security researcher Jon “GainSec” Gaines, who <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB0gr7Fh6lY&amp;t=1387s&amp;ref=404media.co"><u>recently found numerous vulnerabilities</u></a> in several other models of Flock’s automated license plate reader (ALPR) cameras. They shared the details of what they found&nbsp; with me, and I verified many of the details seen in the exposed portals by driving to Bakersfield to walk in front of two cameras there while I watched myself on the livestream. I also pulled Flock’s contracts with cities for Condor cameras, pulled details from company presentations about the technology, and geolocated a handful of the cameras to cities and towns across the United States. Jordan also filmed himself in front of several of the cameras on the Peachtree Creek Greenway bike path. Jordan said he and Gaines discovered many of the exposed cameras with Shodan, an internet of things search engine that researchers regularly use to identify improperly secured devices.&nbsp;</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vU1-uiUlHTo?start=181&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="This Flock Camera Leak is like Netflix For Stalkers"></iframe></figure><p>After finding links to the feed, “immediately, we were just without any username, without any password, we were just seeing everything from playgrounds to parking lots with people, Christmas shopping and unloading their stuff into cars,” Jordan told me in an interview. “I think it was like the first time that I actually got like immediately scared … I think the one that affected me most was as playground. You could see unattended kids, and that’s something I want people to know about so they can understand how dangerous this is.” In a YouTube video about his research, Jordan said he was able to use footage pulled from the exposed feed to identify specific people using open source investigation tools in order to show how trivially an exposure like this could be abused.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://blog.kierangill.xyz/oversight-and-guidance">https://blog.kierangill.xyz/oversight-and-guidance</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46354970">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      
<p>How do we scale LLMs to larger codebases? Nobody knows yet. But by understanding how <a href="https://blog.kierangill.xyz/ai-strengths-and-limitations-in-engineering.html">LLMs contribute to engineering</a>, we realize that investments in <em>guidance</em> and <em>oversight</em> are worthwhile.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Guidance</strong>: The context, the environment.</li>
<li><strong>Oversight</strong>: The skill set needed to guide, validate, and verify the implementor's<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> <em>choices</em>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Investing in guidance</h2>
<p>When an LLM can generate a working high-quality implementation in a single try, that is called <strong>one-shotting</strong>. This is the most efficient form of LLM programming.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.kierangill.xyz/images/guidance-and-oversight-target-hitting.webp" alt="An arrow hitting the center of a dart board.">
</p>

<p>The opposite of one-shotting is rework. This is when you fail to get a usable output from the LLM and must manually intervene.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> This often takes longer than just doing the work yourself.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.kierangill.xyz/images/guidance-and-oversight-target-missing.webp" alt="Multiple arrows on a dart board. They have all missed the center.">
</p>

<p>So how do we create more opportunities for one-shotting? Better guidance.</p>
<h3>Better guidance</h3>
<p>LLMs are choice generators. Every set of tokens is a choice added to your codebase: how a variable is named, where to organize a function, whether to reuse/extend/or duplicate functionality to solve a problem, whether Postgres should be chosen over Redis, and so on.</p>
<p>Often, these choices are best left up to the designer (e.g., via the prompt). However, it's not efficient to exhaustively list all of these choices in a prompt. It's also not efficient to rework an LLM output whenever it gets these choices wrong.</p>
<p>In the ideal world, the prompt only captures the business requirements of a feature. The rest of the choices are either inferrable or encoded.</p>
<h4>Write a prompt library</h4>
<p>A prompt library is a set of documentation that can be included as context for an LLM. </p>
<p>Writing this is simple: collate documentation, best practices, a general map of the codebase, and other context an engineer needs to be productive in <em>your</em> codebase.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> </p>
<p>Making a prompt library useful requires iteration. Every time the LLM is slightly off target, ask yourself, "What could've been clarified?" Then, add that answer back into the prompt library.</p>
<p>A prompt library needs to strike the right balance between <em>comprehensive</em> and <em>lean</em>.</p>


<h4>The environment is your context</h4>
<p>A peer at Meta told me that they weren't in a position to make Zuckerberg's <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/quickerbettertech/2025/01/26/business-tech-news-zuckerberg-says-ai-will-replace-mid-level-engineers-soon/">engineering automation claims</a> a reality. The reason is their codebase is riddled with technical debt. He wasn't surprised by this. Meta (apparently) historically has not prioritized paying down their debts. </p>

<p>Compare this to the mentality from the <a href="https://youtu.be/BGgsoIgbT_Y?si=vsIrpQVQquas6PYH&amp;t=988">Cursor team</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think ultimately the principles of clean software are not that different when you want it to be read by people and by models. When you are trying to write clean code you want to, not repeat yourself, not make things more complicated than they need to be.</p>
<p>I think taste in code... is actually gonna become even more important as these models get better because it will be easier to write more and more code and so it'll be more and more important to structure it in a tasteful way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the <em>garbage in, garbage out</em> principle in action. The utility of a model is bottlenecked by its inputs. The more garbage you have, the more likely hallucinations will occur.</p>
<p>Here's a LLM literacy dipstick: ask a peer engineer to read some code they're unfamiliar with. Do they understand it? Do they struggle to navigate it? If it's a module, can they quickly understand what all that module exposes? Do they know the implications of using a certain function, the side-effects they must be aware of? No? Then the LLM won't either.</p>
<p>Here's another dipstick: Ask an LLM agent to tell you how certain functionality works. You should know the answer before asking the LLM. Is their answer right? More importantly, how did they go about answering your question? Follow the LLM's trail and document its snags. You'll notice it tends to <code>grep</code>, <code>ls</code>, and <code>cat</code> to search. How can you give it a map so it isn't left to rediscover the codebase on each new prompt? When a map can't be given, how do you make it easier for them to navigate the codebase?</p>
<p>How you make the environment better suited for LLM literacy is dependent on the tech stack and domain. But general principles apply: modularity, simplicity, things are well-named, logic is encapsulated. Be consistent and encode these conventions in your prompt library.</p>

<h2>Investing in oversight</h2>
<p>We need guidance <em>and</em> oversight. A 3-ton truck with a middle-schooler behind the wheel puts people in the hospital (and in jail). This is why the mentality of automating engineers is objectionable. We should be fostering our teams, not discarding them.</p>
<p>Remember, engineers operate on <a href="https://blog.kierangill.xyz/ai-strengths-and-limitations-in-engineering.html">two timelines</a>. As overseers of implementation, we must plan for the future of the codebase. If an LLM makes a choice, the overseer should be able to discern whether it was a good one or a bad one. For example, let's say the LLM opted to use Redis over Postgres to store some metadata. Was that a good choice? The overseer should know.</p>
<p>An investment in oversight is an investment in <strong>team</strong>, <strong>alignment</strong>, and <strong>workflows</strong>.</p>
<p>For <em>team</em>, it's worth investing in elevating everyone's design capabilities.</p>
<p>Design produces architecture. Architecture is a bet on the future. It's a bet that by setting up a program in a certain way, it will make the future feature development easier.</p>
<p>Architects are often created through experience. A career of shooting yourself in the foot builds intuition. This intuition shapes new software from having the same mistakes.</p>
<details>
<summary><strong>Aside</strong>: Some thoughts on how to grow design skills</summary>
<p>Read books, blogs, and code. Watch conference talks. Replicate masterworks. Practice by writing programs that you don't know how to build.</p>
<p>On replicating masterworks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Student artists are often required to replicate masterworks. A masterwork is an art piece that an expert artist made. Through the process of replicating this masterwork, an artist gains practical experience at the bleeding edge of art. (This experience also builds confidence, which is a bonus.)</li>
<li>The same is true for engineering. I've learned more by <a href="https://interpreterbook.com/">writing a programming language</a> than I have in reading a hundred blog posts.</li>
<li>Why does this work?<ul>
<li>You understand a layer of abstraction deeper than the layer you're working at (this is a Cantrill-ism, but I can't find the quote). </li>
<li>Masters use techniques and workflows that are best learned via practice. Thorsten Ball taught me how to break down large problems into tractable phases. Each phase had a contract and each contract could be tested.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>On reading code:</p>
<ul>
<li>A good way to expand your vocabulary of solutions.</li>
<li>In Steve Ruiz's V1 of <a href="https://www.tldraw.com/">TLDraw</a>, I learned the <a href="https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/blob/v1.6.1/packages/tldraw/src/state/sessions/DrawSession/DrawSession.ts">patterns</a> necessary to later implement session-based undo/redo for an internal tool at work.</li>
<li>Reading <a href="https://github.com/SerenityOS/jakt/blob/d792ad5029a8a7f5385bbdf7d404240692975f74/selfhost/parser.jakt">code from leaders in the field</a> is also a good way to build taste. </li>
</ul>
</details>
<p>Oversight is not only about architecture, but also <a href="https://engineering.blueberrypediatrics.blog/candidate-evaluation-rigor-urgency">temperament</a>, <a href="https://engineering.blueberrypediatrics.blog/candidate-evaluation-framework">alignment to values</a>, and <a href="https://engineering.blueberrypediatrics.blog/sequencing-for-value">workflows</a>. Operators need to be both technical and product experts. Without a deep understanding of the product, it's easy to accidentally build the wrong solution.</p>
<h3>Automating oversight</h3>
<p>Some design concerns can be checked programmatically. </p>
<p>Moving more implementation feedback from human to computer helps us improve the chance of one-shotting. Agents can get feedback directly from their environment (e.g., type errors).</p>
<p>Think of these as bumper rails. You can increase the likelihood of an LLM reaching the bowling pins by making it impossible to land in the gutter.</p>
<p>One way to do this is through writing <strong>safety</strong> checks. But what is safety? Safety is <em>protecting your abstractions</em>. Pierce's <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/tapl/">Types and Programming Languages</a> has my favorite definition of safety:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Informally, though, safe languages can be defined as ones that make it impossible to shoot yourself in the foot while programming.</p>
<p>Refining this intuition a little, we could say that a safe language <em>is one that protects its own abstractions</em>.</p>
<p>Safety refers to the language's ability to guarantee the integrity of these abstractions and of higher-level abstractions introduced by the programmer using the definitional facilities of the language. For example, a language may provide arrays, with access and update operations, as an abstraction of the underlying memory. A programmer using this language then expects that an array can be changed only by using the update operation on it explicitly—and not, for example, by writing past the end of some other data structure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We tend to write tests for business-logic but don't always write tests for architecture-logic. Some programming languages have facilities for this built in.</p>

<h2>Addressing verification</h2>
<p><img src="https://blog.kierangill.xyz/images/llms-in-software-engineering-cycle.webp" alt="A very simplified graphic for the design / implementation / verification cycle">
</p>

<p>Design and implementation are only two pieces of a project's lifecycle. <em>Verification</em>, like code review or QA, are necessary for building quality software.</p>
<p>As the volume of work increases, our ability to ship that work becomes constrained by our ability to review it.</p>
<p>Here are some incomplete ideas for addressing the verification bottleneck:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lowering the barrier of entry to perform manual QA (not needing a dev env).</li>
<li>Invest in a testing setup that makes it easy to express tests (including setting up tests, e.g., with test data creation) with minimal code. </li>
<li>Encode frequent PR feedback into documentation so that there is some level of PR review an LLM can reasonably do.</li>
<li>Security is baked in as defaults in the framework, not context.</li>
</ul>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Move over, GE Widescreen 1000. In 1989 in Japan, Sony introduced to the largest Trinitron CRT ever built, the KV-45ED1, also known as the PVM-4300. And in 1990, they imported 20 of them to the United States, just in time for the recession. About 34 years later, one of these enigmatic TVs surfaced.</p><h2>Sony’s PVM-4300/KV-45ED1</h2><figure id="attachment_35264" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-35264"><a href="https://dfarq.homeip.net/the-biggest-crt-ever-made-sonys-pvm-4300/sony_pvm_4300/" rel="attachment wp-att-35264"><img data-recalc-dims="1" fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/dfarq.homeip.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Sony_PVM_4300.jpg?resize=300%2C209&amp;ssl=1" alt="The Sony PVM-4300, next to a 29-inch TV" width="300" height="209" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/dfarq.homeip.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Sony_PVM_4300.jpg?resize=300%2C209&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/dfarq.homeip.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Sony_PVM_4300.jpg?w=607&amp;ssl=1 607w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-35264">The Sony PVM-4300 was the largest CRT TV ever made. Its 45-inch tube provided 43 inches of visible improved definition TV. It stood about 27 inches tall.</figcaption></figure><p>Sony’s part number suggests it has a 45 inch tube inside. But in a rare case of truth in advertising, Sony advertised it as a 43-inch model. It weighed about 450 pounds, stood about 27 inches tall, and it wouldn’t fit through a standard door frame. That’s probably okay, it’s not like someone was going to use this as a bedroom TV. This thing was going in your living room.</p><p>In Japan, it sold for 2.6 million yen, but in the United States, it retailed for $40,000, a significant markup. To be fair, shipping them across the Atlantic and then throughout the United States must have been expensive. And news articles in 1990 said Sony dealers would not allow any bickering. They would throw in a couple of options like the separate tuner or speakers. But no discounts.</p><p>Sony said at the time they hoped to sell 80 of them that year, but the recession may have kept that from happening.</p><h2>The biggest conventional CRT ever</h2><p>The Sony PVM-4300 was a conventional CRT, unlike the <a href="https://dfarq.homeip.net/ge-widescreen-1000/">GE Widescreen 1000</a>, which was a projection set. Projection TVs could be bigger and cheaper. But if you wanted the clearest picture, a big CRT was where it was at.</p><p>It was a conventional CRT that worked with over the air signals, but like many larger TVs of the era, it used a technology called IDTV to enhance the picture quality. The “ID” stood for “improved definition.” IDTV sets had a buffer so they would store successive frames and interpolate them rather than interlacing them the way a conventional CRT TV worked. They also had circuitry to detect motion and perform image stabilization to further enhance the image. The result wasn’t as good as HDTV. But it gave high rollers a better picture until HDTV. HDTV arrived in 1998, but articles at the time estimated 2005. The Chicago Tribune warned in 1990 that these $40,000 TVs would be obsolete in 15 years, but the salesperson countered that every TV would be obsolete in 15 years.</p><p>It’s also likely that someone in the market for a $40,000 TV didn’t worry about obsolescence. In 1990, the GE Widescreen 1000 looked dated and it wasn’t 15 years old yet.</p><h2>Why so expensive?</h2><p>The KV-45ED1 or PVM-4300 cost about 8 times as much as Sony’s second most expensive model at the time, which had a 29-inch screen. That’s largely because the KV-45ED1 had to be built by hand. Sony could mass produce its smaller TVs. This was a product for buyers who weren’t worried about the price.</p><p><a href="https://dfarq.homeip.net/the-last-sony-crt-ever-made/">Sony continued making CRTs into the 21st century</a>, bowing out with its high-def KD-34XBR970, 36-inch KD-36FS170, 32-inch KV-32FS170 and 27-inch KV27FS170 in February 2006.</p><p>It is unclear how many of these enormous 43-inch units Sony sold, and some people even questioned if it was ever built. A Chicago area dealer told the <em>Chicago Tribune</em> in 1990 that someone had purchased one, but that the buyer wanted to remain anonymous. That was good enough for me; a TV dealer wasn’t going to tell a newspaper that they have a $40,000 item and then not have it. That’s just bad business. Good business is taking the free advertising, having an example on display to show knowing most won’t buy it, but they may buy one of the smaller units. But luring someone into the store with a lie makes it much more difficult to sell anything.</p><p>And the Tribune wasn’t going to make something like this up. It would anger the TV dealers and risk losing their advertising. And someone who could afford a $40,000 TV was likely a business owner or high-ranking executive who could pull their advertising. In the days of print newspapers, advertisers and potential advertisers held a lot of sway. This could be both good and bad. I’m not going to say capitalism solves every problem but this was a case where it helped keep people honest.</p><h2>Shank Mods’ surviving Sony PVM-4300</h2><p>On December 22, 2024, Youtuber Shank Mods released a video telling the story of a Sony PVM-4300 and how he acquired it. One of the photos of a purported surviving unit turned out to be very real. It was taken in a restaurant in Japan, and the owner was actually aware of the photo. Unfortunately the restaurant was having to move, and needed to get rid of the set.&nbsp;Shank Mods was able to contact some people in Japan who could help race against time and remove the TV from the restaurant and then ship it to the United States.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfZxOuc9Qwk&amp;pp=ygUOc2hhbmsgbW9kcyBjcnQ%3D">The 35-minute video</a> is well worth watching if you have interest in vintage CRTs, or even if you just like stories of strangers coming together and helping each other just for the sake of being helpful. Actually, I take that back. At the end of the video, Shank Mods played a prank on his fellow CRT fans that is absolutely hilarious and makes the video worth watching for that reason alone. I won’t ruin it for you.</p><p>We can only guess how many other examples may survive. But we now know that at least one survives and is in the hands of a retro hobbyist.</p><div itemtype="http://schema.org/Person" itemscope="" itemprop="author"><p><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/dfarq.homeip.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/dave_farquhar_181px.jpg?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1" data-src="https://i0.wp.com/dfarq.homeip.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/dave_farquhar_181px.jpg?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1" width="100" height="100" alt="" itemprop="image"></p><div><p>David Farquhar is a computer security professional, entrepreneur, and author.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

	<p>A client once responded to one of my questions by saying, “Oh Greg, I am too busy living to think <a href="https://gregmckeown.com/about/">about</a> life!” His off-the-cuff comment named a trap all of us fall into sometimes. In just one example, it is easy to become so consumed&nbsp;<em>in&nbsp;</em>our careers we fail to really think&nbsp;<em><a href="https://gregmckeown.com/about/">about</a>&nbsp;</em>our careers.</p>
<p>To avoid this trap, I suggest carving out a couple of hours over the holiday break to follow these simple steps for reflecting on your career.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: <a href="https://gregmckeown.com/books/effortless/review/">Review</a> the last 12 months</strong>. <a href="https://gregmckeown.com/books/effortless/review/">Review</a> the year, month by month. Make a list of where you spent your time: include your major projects, responsibilities and accomplishments. No need to overcomplicate this.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Ask, “What is the <a href="https://gregmckeown.com/news/">news</a>?”</strong>&nbsp;Look over your list and reflect on what is&nbsp;<em>really</em>&nbsp;going on. Think like a journalist and ask yourself: Why does this matter? What are the trends here? What happens if these trends continue?</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Ask “What would I do in my career if I could do</strong><strong>&nbsp;<em>anything</em>?”&nbsp;</strong>Just brainstorm with no voice of criticism to hold you back. Just write out all the ideas that come to mind.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Go back and spend a bit more time on Step 3.</strong>&nbsp;Too often we begin our career planning with our second best option in mind. We have a sense of what we would most love to do but we&nbsp;<em>immediately</em>&nbsp;push it aside. Why? Typically because “it is not realistic” which is code for, “I can’t make money doing this.” In this economy—in any economy—I understand why making money is critical. However, sometimes we pass by legitimate career paths because we set them aside too quickly.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Write down six objectives for the next 12 months.</strong>&nbsp;Make a list of the top six items you would like to accomplish in your career this year and place them in priority order.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6: Cross off the bottom five.</strong>&nbsp;Once you’re back to the whirlwind of work you’ll benefit from having a single “true north” career objective for the year.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7: Make an action plan for this month.</strong>&nbsp;Make a list of some quick wins you’d like to have in place over the next 3-4 weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Step 8: Decide what you will say no to.</strong>&nbsp;Make a list of the “good” things that will keep you from achieving your one “great” career objective. Think <a href="https://gregmckeown.com/about/">about</a> how to delete, defer or delegate these other tasks.&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Waldo_Emerson" target="_blank">Ralph Waldo Emerson</a>&nbsp;said, “The crime which bankrupts men and nations is that of turning aside from one’s main purpose to serve a job here and there.”</p>
<p>Many years ago I followed this process and, without exaggeration, it changed the course of my life. The insight I gained led me to quit law school, leave England and move to America and start down the path as a teacher and author. You’re reading this because of that choice. It remains the single most important career decision of my life.</p>
<p>Two hours spent wisely over the next couple of weeks could easily improve the quality of your life over the 8760 hours of the next year–and perhaps far beyond. After all,&nbsp;<em>if we don’t design our careers, someone else will.</em></p>

  <p data-date="2025-12-22T00:00:00">written on December 22, 2025</p>
  

  <p>2025 draws to a close and it’s been quite a year.  Around this time last year, I
wrote a post that reflected <a href="https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2024/12/26/reflecting-on-life/">on my life</a>.  Had
I written about programming, it might have aged badly, as 2025 has been a year
like no other for my profession.</p>
<h2>2025 Was Different</h2>
<p>2025 was the year of changes.  Not only did I leave Sentry and start my new
company, it was also the year I stopped programming the way I did before.  <a href="https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2025/6/4/changes/">In
June</a> I finally felt confident enough to share that my way
of working was different:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Where I used to spend most of my time in Cursor, I now mostly use Claude Code,
almost entirely hands-off. […] If you would have told me even just six months
ago that I’d prefer being an engineering lead to a virtual programmer intern
over hitting the keys myself, I would not have believed it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While I set out last year wanting to write more, that desire had nothing to do
with agentic coding.  Yet I published 36 posts — almost 18% of all posts on this
blog since 2007.  I also had around a hundred conversations with programmers,
founders, and others about AI because I was fired up with curiosity after
falling into the agent rabbit hole.</p>
<p>2025 was also a not so great year for the world.  To make my peace with it, I
<a href="https://dark.ronacher.eu/">started a separate blog</a> to separate out my thoughts
from here.</p>
<h2>The Year Of Agents</h2>
<p>It started with a growing obsession with Claude Code in April or May, resulting
in months of building my own agents and using others’.  Social media exploded
with opinions on AI: some good, some bad.</p>
<p>Now I feel I have found a new stable status quo for how I reason about where we
are and where we are going.  I’m doubling down on code generation, file systems,
programmatic tool invocation via an interpreter glue, and skill-based learning.
Basically: what Claude Code innovated is still state of the art for me.  That
has worked very well over the last few months, and seeing foundation model
providers double down on skills reinforces my belief in this approach.</p>
<p>I’m still perplexed by how TUIs made such a strong comeback.  At the moment I’m
using <a href="https://ampcode.com/">Amp</a>, <a href="https://claude.com/product/claude-code">Claude
Code</a>, and
<a href="https://shittycodingagent.ai/">Pi</a>, all from the command line.  Amp feels like
the Apple or Porsche of agentic coding tools, Claude Code is the affordable
Volkswagen, and Pi is the Hacker’s Open Source choice for me.  They all feel
like projects built by people who, like me, use them to an unhealthy degree to
build their own products, but with different trade-offs.</p>
<p>I continue to be blown away by what LLMs paired with tool execution can do. At
the beginning of the year I mostly used them for code generation, but now a big
number of my agentic uses are day-to-day things.  I’m sure we will see some
exciting pushes towards consumer products in 2026.  LLMs are now helping me with
organizing my life, and I expect that to grow further.</p>
<h2>The Machine And Me</h2>
<p>Because LLMs now not only help me program, I’m starting to rethink my
relationship to those machines.  I increasingly find it harder not to create
parasocial bonds with some of the tools I use.  I find this odd and
discomforting.  Most agents we use today do not have much of a memory and have
little personality but it’s easy to build yourself one that does.  An LLM with
memory is an experience that is hard to shake off.</p>
<p>It’s both fascinating and questionable.  I have tried to train myself for two
years, to think of these models as mere token tumblers, but that reductive view
does not work for me any longer.  These systems we now create have human
tendencies, but elevating them to a human level would be a mistake.  I
increasingly take issue with calling these machines “agents,” yet I have no
better word for it.  I take issue with “agent” as a term because agency and
responsibility should remain with humans.  Whatever they are becoming, they can
trigger emotional responses in us that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot_psychosis">can be
detrimental</a> if we are not
careful.  Our inability to properly name and place these creations in relation
to us is a challenge I believe we need to solve.</p>
<p>Because of all this unintentional anthropomorphization, I’m really struggling at
times to find the right words for how I’m working with these machines.  I know
that this is not just me; it’s others too.  It creates even more discomfort when
working with people who currently reject these systems outright.  One of the
most common comments I read in response to agentic coding tool articles is this
rejection of giving the machine personality.</p>
<h2>Opinions Everywhere</h2>
<p>An unexpected aspect of using AI so much is that we talk far more about vibes
than anything else.  This way of working is less than a year old, yet it
challenges half a century of software engineering experience.  So there are many
opinions, and it’s hard to say which will stand the test of time.</p>
<p>I found a lot of conventional wisdom I don’t agree with, but I have nothing to
back up my opinions.  How would I?  I quite vocally shared my lack of success
with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_Context_Protocol">MCP</a> throughout the
year, but I had little to back it up beyond “does not work for me.”  Others
swore by it.  Similar with model selection.  <a href="https://steipete.me/">Peter</a>, who
got me hooked on Claude early in the year, moved to Codex and is happy with it.
I don’t enjoy that experience nearly as much, though I started using it more.  I
have nothing beyond vibes to back up my preference for Claude.</p>
<p>It’s also important to know that some of the vibes come with intentional
signalling.  Plenty of people whose views you can find online have a financial
interest in one product over another, for instance because they are
investors in it or they are paid influencers.  They might have become investors
because they liked the product, but it’s also possible that their views are
affected and shaped by that relationship.</p>
<h2>Outsourcing vs Building Yourself</h2>
<p>Pick up a library from any AI company today and you’ll notice they’re built with
Stainless or Fern.  The docs use Mintlify, the site’s authentication system
might be Clerk.  Companies now sell services you would have built yourself
previously.  This increase in outsourcing of core services to companies
specializing in it meant that the bar for some aspects of the user experience
has risen.</p>
<p>But with our newfound power from agentic coding tools, you can build much of
this yourself.  I had Claude build me an SDK generator for Python and TypeScript
— partly out of curiosity, partly because it felt easy enough.  As you might
know, I’m a proponent of <a href="https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2025/2/20/ugly-code/">simple code</a> and <a href="https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2025/1/24/build-it-yourself/">building it
yourself</a>.  This makes me somewhat optimistic
that AI has the potential to encourage building on fewer dependencies.  At the
same time, it’s not clear to me that we’re moving that way given the current
trends of outsourcing everything.</p>
<h2>Learnings and Wishes</h2>
<p>This brings me not to predictions but to wishes for where we could put our
energy next.  I don’t really know what I’m looking for here, but I want to point
at my pain points and give some context and food for thought.</p>
<h3>New Kind Of Version Control</h3>
<p>My biggest unexpected finding: we’re hitting limits of traditional tools for
sharing code.  The pull request model on GitHub doesn’t carry enough information
to review AI generated code properly — I wish I could see the prompts that led
to changes.  It’s not just GitHub, it’s also git that is lacking.</p>
<p>With agentic coding, part of what makes the models work today is knowing the
mistakes.  If you steer it back to an earlier state, you want the tool to
remember what went wrong.  There is, for lack of a better word, value in
failures.  As humans we might also benefit from knowing the paths that did not
lead us anywhere, but for machines this is critical information.  You notice
this when you are trying to compress the conversation history.  Discarding the
paths that led you astray means that the model will try the same mistakes again.</p>
<p>Some agentic coding tools have begun spinning up worktrees or creating
checkpoints in git for restore, in-conversation branch and undo features.
There’s room for UX innovation that could make these tools easier to work with.
This is probably why we’re seeing discussions about stacked diffs and
alternative version control systems like <a href="https://www.jj-vcs.dev/">Jujutsu</a>.</p>
<p>Will this change GitHub or will it create space for some new competition?  I
hope so.  I increasingly want to better understand genuine human input and tell
it apart from machine output.  I want to see the prompts and the attempts that
failed along the way.  And then somehow I want to squash and compress it all on
merge, but with a way to retrieve the full history if needed.</p>
<h3>New Kind Of Review</h3>
<p>This is related to the version control piece: current code review tools assign
strict role definitions that just don’t work with AI.  Take the GitHub code
review UI: I regularly want to use comments on the PR view to leave notes for
my own agents, but there is no guided way to do that.  The review interface
refuses to let me review my own code, I can only comment, but that does not
have quite the same intention.</p>
<p>There is also the problem that an increased amount of code review now happens
between me and my agents locally.  For instance, the Codex code review feature
on GitHub stopped working for me because it can only be bound to one
organization at a time.  So I now use Codex on the command line to do reviews,
but that means a whole part of my iteration cycles is invisible to other
engineers on the team.  That doesn’t work for me.</p>
<p>Code review to me feels like it needs to become part of the VCS.</p>
<h3>New Observability</h3>
<p>I also believe that observability is up for grabs again.  We now have both the
need and opportunity to take advantage of it on a whole new level.  Most people
were not in a position where they could build their own
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBPF">eBPF</a> programs, but LLMs can.  Likewise,
many observability tools shied away from SQL because of its complexity, but LLMs
are better at it than any proprietary query language.  They can write queries,
they can grep, they can map-reduce, they remote-control LLDB.  Anything that has
some structure and text is suddenly fertile ground for agentic coding tools to
succeed.  I don’t know what the observability of the future looks like, but my
strong hunch is that we will see plenty of innovation here.  The better the
feedback loop to the machine, the better the results.</p>
<p>I’m not even sure what I’m asking for here, but I think that one of the
challenges in the past was that many cool ideas for better observability —
specifically dynamic reconfiguration of services for more targeted filtering —
were user-unfriendly because they were complex and hard to use.  But now those
might be the right solutions in light of LLMs because of their increased
capabilities for doing this grunt work.  For instance Python 3.14 landed <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.14.html#whatsnew314-remote-debugging">an
external debugger
interface</a>
which is an amazing capability for an agentic coding tool.</p>
<h3>Working With Slop</h3>
<p>This may be a little more controversial, but what I haven’t managed this year is
to give in to the machine.  I still treat it like regular software engineering
and review a lot.  I also recognize that an increasing number of people are not
working with this model of engineering but instead completely given in to the
machine.  As crazy as that sounds, I have seen some people be quite successful
with this.  I don’t yet know how to reason about this, but it is clear to me
that even though code is being generated in the end, the way of working in that
new world is very different from the world that I’m comfortable with.  And my
suspicion is that because that world is here to stay, we might need some new
social contracts to separate these out.</p>
<p>The most obvious version of this is the increased amount of these types of
contributions to Open Source projects, which are quite frankly an insult to
anyone who is not working in that model.  I find reading such pull requests
quite rage-inducing.</p>
<p>Personally, I’ve tried to attack this problem with contribution guidelines and
pull request templates.  But this seems a little like a fight against windmills.
This might be something where the solution will not come from changing what
we’re doing.  Instead, it might come from vocal people who are also pro-AI
engineering speaking out on what good behavior in an agentic codebase looks
like.  And it is not just to throw up unreviewed code and then have another
person figure the shit out.</p>

What motivated people to construct these solar-calibrated masterpieces?</b></p><p>The winter solstice, which usually falls on 21 or 22 December in the Northern Hemisphere each year, marks the moment that one yearly cycle comes to an end and another is born. It is the day with the smallest number of sunlight hours in the calendar, and once it's over, the days lengthen again incrementally until the <a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20230616-gen-z-and-millennials-surprising-midsummer-obsession">summer solstice</a> in June.</p><p>The significance of this day is manifested in ancient monuments that were designed to acknowledge and celebrate its passing. One example is <a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20231221-maeshowe-the-uks-doorway-to-another-world">Maeshowe tomb in Orkney</a>. To the untrained eye this burial cairn, created around 2800BC, looks like a grassy hillock – but it conceals a cuboid, stone-clad sepulchre and a 33ft (10m) long entry corridor oriented to the south-west. During midwinter, three weeks either side of the winter solstice, the setting Sun aims directly down the corridor and emanates its light into the tomb.</p><div><p><span>It's possible to understand the enormous significance of the winter solstice both as the darkest moment in the calendar and the pivot to six future months of greater illumination</span></p></div><p>When the sky is cloudless, the light seems to carve a golden aperture into the tomb's rear wall – a sacrament of pure light. These days of radiance are interrupted by the solstice itself, when blackness temporarily takes over. But daylight reappears soon after, to blaze for another few days as if in celebration of the promise of nature's rejuvenation in spring.</p></div><div data-component="layout-block"><figure><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" aria-label="image unavailable"><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0mpp4n7.jpg.webp 160w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0mpp4n7.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0mpp4n7.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0mpp4n7.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0mpp4n7.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0mpp4n7.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0mpp4n7.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0mpp4n7.jpg.webp 1376w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0mpp4n7.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0mpp4n7.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Alamy Orkney's Maeshowe tomb is a burial cairn created around 2800BC that conceals a stone-clad sepulchre (Credit: Alamy)"><span>Alamy</span></p><figcaption>Orkney's Maeshowe tomb is a burial cairn created around 2800BC that conceals a stone-clad sepulchre (Credit: Alamy)</figcaption></figure><p>We will probably never know the specific beliefs and rituals that inspired Maeshowe tomb. But it's nonetheless possible to understand the enormous significance of the winter solstice as the "year's midnight", both as the darkest moment in the calendar and the pivot to six future months of greater illumination. It was a moment of death and rebirth, and a reminder of the cyclical nature of time.</p><p>In the deep past, understanding the markers of nature's clockwork – including solstices – was a matter of survival. Predicting the recurrent patterns of animal migration, for example, could help successful hunting and fishing. Knowing when the climate was likely to change meant being able to adapt and survive. In pre-agricultural societies, it helped people anticipate the availability and location of edible roots, nuts and plants.</p><p>After the introduction of farming, around 9000BC, it was essential – for successful planting and harvesting – to anticipate the timing of seasonal changes. Monuments that calculated time had practical value, but it's likely that they also embodied spiritual beliefs in Neolithic times too, with the winter solstice being of particular importance. This very ancient recognition of the solstice's significance even echoes through to the modern world. The word "Yule", now associated with the winter holiday period, derives from the historic Norse festival of <i id="jól,">Jól,</i> which was based around the winter solstice. Modern Christmas traditions recall bygone midwinter celebrations like the Roman holiday of Saturnalia, which involved feasting and gift-giving. And the solstice continues to be acknowledged in hundreds of traditions across the world, such as the Inca celebration of Inti Raymi, and the Dōngzhì festival in China.</p><h2><span id="'nature's-sublime-power'"><b id="'nature's-sublime-power'">'Nature's sublime power'</b></span></h2><p>Alongside Maeshowe tomb, archaeologists have discovered dozens of Neolithic monuments that stare directly at the Sun on the winter solstice. There's Stonehenge (England), whose tallest trilithon once framed the setting sun; Newgrange (Ireland), which has a passageway aligned to sunrise on this auspicious day; and the standing stones at Callanish (Outer Hebrides) which create similar solar sightlines. In Brittany, north-western France, is <i id="la-roche-aux-fées:">La Roche aux Fées:</i> a megalithic passageway constructed from 41 blocks of stone, some of which weigh over 40 tonnes (40,000kg). At sunrise on the winter solstice, it breathes in its annual dose of restorative midwinter light. Legends once told that fairies constructed it over the course of one night, but it is actually a dolmen (tomb) created by Neolithic architects around 2750BC.</p></div><div data-component="layout-block"><p>Another masterpiece of Land Art, James Turrell's Roden Crater (begun 1979), does this on an even more epic scale than Sun Tunnels. It occupies a volcanic cinder cone in the Painted Desert region of northern Arizona and houses multiple spaces from which to watch celestial phenomena. One of them is a 900ft- (274m) long tunnel drilled through the volcanic cone. It acts like a camera obscura, focusing an image of the midwinter sun (via a glass lens halfway down the passage) on to a slab of white marble in a central chamber. Like Maeshowe tomb's passage, it aligns with the Sun's position <a target="_blank" href="https://rodencrater.com/celestial-events/">around 21 December each year</a>, and drinks down the Sun's light from 10 days before the solstice to the 10th day after it.</p><figure><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" aria-label="image unavailable"><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0mpp6tg.jpg.webp 160w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0mpp6tg.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0mpp6tg.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0mpp6tg.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0mpp6tg.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0mpp6tg.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0mpp6tg.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0mpp6tg.jpg.webp 1376w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0mpp6tg.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0mpp6tg.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images The epic Roden Crater in Northern Arizona houses multiple spaces from which to watch celestial phenomena (Credit: Getty Images)"><span>Getty Images</span></p><figcaption>The epic Roden Crater in Northern Arizona houses multiple spaces from which to watch celestial phenomena (Credit: Getty Images)</figcaption></figure><p>Enoura Observatory in Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan (completed 2017) was designed by photographer and architect Hiroshi Sugimoto.

He wanted to correct what he saw as a lack of purpose in contemporary art by exploring the primal concerns of our ancient ancestors – our status within the infinite wilderness of the cosmos, our sense of time, and our notion of a human identity within the natural order.</p><p>One of its structures, the "Winter Solstice Light-Worship Tunnel", points directly at the spot on the horizon where the Sun rises at about 06:48 local time on 21 December each year. The solstice sunlight floods this 230ft-(70m) long chamber made of Corten steel and illuminates a stone medieval wellhead that is situated halfway along its length. It passes underneath another structure which aligns with the Sun on the summer solstice. The entire site, which took a decade to build, was intended by Sugimoto to act like a living clock, and to make <a target="_blank" href="https://www.odawara-af.com/en/enoura/">an artwork</a> with the ancient function of helping humans "identify their place within the vastness of the universe".</p><figure><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" aria-label="image unavailable"><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0mpp7qg.jpg.webp 160w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0mpp7qg.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0mpp7qg.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0mpp7qg.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0mpp7qg.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0mpp7qg.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0mpp7qg.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0mpp7qg.jpg.webp 1376w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0mpp7qg.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0mpp7qg.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Odawara Art Foundation Hiroshi Sugimoto created the Enoura Observatory in Japan, whose buildings are all calibrated towards the movement of the Sun (Credit: Odawara Art Foundation)"><span>Odawara Art Foundation</span></p><figcaption>Hiroshi Sugimoto created the Enoura Observatory in Japan, whose buildings are all calibrated towards the movement of the Sun (Credit: Odawara Art Foundation)</figcaption></figure></div></div>]]></description>

<h2><a name="goals-of-the-debian-git-transition-project">Goals of the Debian git transition project</a></h2>
<ol start="0" type="1"><li><strong>Everyone who interacts with Debian source code should be able to do so entirely in git.</strong>
</li></ol>
<p>That means, more specifically:
</p><ol type="1"><li><p>All examination and edits to the source should be performed via normal git operations.

</p></li><li><p>Source code should be transferred and exchanged as git data, not tarballs. git should be the canonical form everywhere.

</p></li><li><p>Upstream git histories should be re-published, traceably, as part of formal git releases published by Debian.

</p></li><li><p>No-one should have to learn about Debian Source Packages, which are bizarre, and have been obsoleted by modern version control.

</p></li></ol>
<p>This is very ambitious, but we have come a long way!
</p><h2><a name="achievements-so-far-and-current-status">Achievements so far, and current status</a></h2>
<p>We have come a very long way. But, there is still much to do - especially, the git transition team <strong>needs your help with adoption, developer outreach, and developer documentation overhaul.</strong>
</p><p>We’ve made big strides towards goals 1 and 4. Goal 2 is partially achieved: we currently have dual running. Goal 3 is within our reach but depends on widespread adoption of tag2upload (and/or dgit push).
</p><p>Downstreams and users can <a href="https://diziet.dreamwidth.org/17579.html">obtain the source code of any Debian package</a> in git form. (<a href="https://manpages.debian.org/trixie/dgit/dgit.1.en.html#dgit">dgit clone</a>, 2013). They can then work with this source code completely in git, including building binaries, merging new versions, even automatically (eg <a href="https://github.com/plugwash/autoforwardportergit?tab=readme-ov-file#pooltogit">Raspbian</a>, 2016), and all without having to deal with source packages at all (eg <a href="https://debconf25.debconf.org/talks/119-automating-downstream-debian-package-builds-and-updates-in-ci/">Wikimedia</a> 2025).
</p><p>A Debian maintainer can maintain their own package entirely in git. They can obtain upstream source code from git, and do their packaging work in git (<code>git-buildpackage</code>, 2006).
</p><p>Every Debian maintainer can (and should!) release their package <em>from git</em> reliably and in a standard form (<a href="https://manpages.debian.org/trixie/dgit/dgit.1.en.html#dgit~15">dgit push</a>, 2013; <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/tag2upload">tag2upload</a>, 2025). This is not only more principled, but also more convenient, and with better UX, than pre-dgit tooling like <code>dput</code>.
</p><p>Indeed a Debian maintainer can now often release their changes to Debian, from git, using <em>only</em> git branches (so no tarballs). Releasing to Debian can be simply pushing a signed tag (<a href="https://wiki.debian.org/tag2upload">tag2upload</a>, 2025).
</p><p>A Debian maintainer can maintain a stack of changes to upstream source code in git (<a href="https://manpages.debian.org/trixie/git-buildpackage/gbp-pq.1.en.html">gbp pq</a> 2009). They can even maintain such a delta series as a rebasing git branch, directly buildable, and use normal <code>git rebase</code> style operations to edit their changes, (<a href="https://manpages.debian.org/trixie/git-dpm/git-dpm.1.en.html">git-dpm</a>, 2010; <a href="https://manpages.debian.org/trixie/git-debrebase/git-debrebase.1.en.html">git-debrebase</a>, 2018)
</p><p>An authorised Debian developer can do a modest update to <em>any</em> package in Debian, even one maintained by someone else, working entirely in git in a <a href="https://manpages.debian.org/testing/dgit/dgit-nmu-simple.7.en.html">standard and convenient way</a> (dgit, 2013).
</p><p>Debian contributors can share their work-in-progress on git forges and collaborate using merge requests, git based code review, and so on. (Alioth, 2003; Salsa, 2018.)
</p><h2><a name="core-engineering-principle">Core engineering principle</a></h2>
<p>The Debian git transition project is based on one core engineering principle:
</p><p><strong>Every Debian Source Package can be losslessly converted to and from git.</strong>
</p><p>In order to <em>transition</em> away from Debian Source Packages, we need to <em>gateway</em> between the old <code>dsc</code> approach, and the new git approach.
</p><p>This gateway obviously needs to be bidirectional: source packages uploaded with legacy tooling like <code>dput</code> need to be imported into a canonical git representation; and of course git branches prepared by developers need to be converted to source packages for the benefit of legacy downstream systems (such as the Debian Archive and <code>apt source</code>).
</p><p>This bidirectional gateway is implemented in <a href="https://salsa.debian.org/dgit-team/dgit"><code>src:dgit</code></a>, and is allowing us to gradually replace dsc-based parts of the Debian system with git-based ones.
</p><h2><a name="correspondence-between-dsc-and-git">Correspondence between dsc and git</a></h2>
<p>A faithful bidirectional gateway must define an invariant:
</p><p><strong>The canonical git tree, corresponding to a .dsc, is the tree resulting from <code>dpkg-source -x</code></strong>.
</p><p>This canonical form is sometimes called the “dgit view”. It’s sometimes not the same as the maintainer’s git branch, because many maintainers are still working with “patches-unapplied” git branches. More on this below.
</p><p>(For <code>3.0 (quilt)</code> .dscs, the canonical git tree doesn’t include the quilt <code>.pc</code> directory.)
</p><h2><a name="patches-applied-vs-patches-unapplied">Patches-applied vs patches-unapplied</a></h2>
<p>The canonical git format is “patches applied”. That is:
</p><p><strong>If Debian has modified the upstream source code, a normal git clone of the canonical branch gives the modified source tree, ready for reading and building.</strong>
</p><p>Many Debian maintainers keep their packages in a different git branch format, where the changes made by Debian, to the upstream source code, are in actual <code>patch</code> files in a <code>debian/patches/</code> subdirectory.
</p><p>Patches-applied has a number of important advantages over patches-unapplied:
</p><ul><li><p><strong>It is familiar to, and doesn’t trick, outsiders to Debian</strong>. Debian insiders radically underestimate how weird “patches-unapplied” is. Even expert software developers can get very confused or even <a href="https://diziet.dreamwidth.org/9556.html">accidentally build binaries without security patches</a>!

</p></li><li><p>Making changes can be done with just normal git commands, eg <code>git commit</code>. Many Debian insiders working with patches-unapplied are still using <a href="https://manpages.debian.org/trixie/quilt/quilt.1.en.html"><code>quilt(1)</code></a>, a footgun-rich contraption for working with patch files!

</p></li><li><p>When developing, one can make changes to upstream code, and to Debian packaging, together, without ceremony. There is no need to switch back and forth between patch queue and packaging branches (as with <code>gbp pq</code>), no need to “commit” patch files, etc. One can always edit every file and commit it with <code>git commit</code>.

</p></li></ul>
<p>The downside is that, with the (bizarre) <code>3.0 (quilt)</code> source format, the patch files files in <code>debian/patches/</code> must somehow be kept up to date. Nowadays though, tools like <code>git-debrebase</code> and <code>git-dpm</code> (and dgit for NMUs) make it very easy to work with patches-applied git branches. <code>git-debrebase</code> can deal very ergonomically even with <a href="https://salsa.debian.org/xen-team/debian-xen">big patch stacks</a>.
</p><p>(For smaller packages which usually have no patches, <a href="https://manpages.debian.org/trixie/dgit/dgit-maint-merge.7.en.html">plain <code>git merge</code> with an upstream git branch</a>, and a <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1007717#384">much simpler dsc format</a>, sidesteps the problem entirely.)
</p><h3><a name="prioritising-debians-users-and-other-outsiders">Prioritising Debian’s users (and other outsiders)</a></h3>
<p>We want everyone to be able to share and modify the software that they interact with. That means we should make source code truly accessible, on the user’s terms.
</p><p>Many of Debian’s processes assume everyone is an insider. It’s okay that there are Debian insiders and that people feel part of something that they worked hard to become involved with. But lack of perspective can lead to software which fails to uphold our values.
</p><p>Our source code practices — in particular, our determination to share properly (and systematically) — are a key part of what makes Debian worthwhile at all. Like Debian’s installer, we want our source code to be useable by Debian outsiders.
</p><p>This is why we have chosen to privilege a git branch format which is more familiar to the world at large, even if it’s less popular in Debian.
</p><h2><a name="consequences-some-of-which-are-annoying">Consequences, some of which are annoying</a></h2>
<p>The requirement that the conversion be <em>bidirectional</em>, <em>lossless</em>, and <em>context-free</em> can be inconvenient.
</p><p>For example, <a href="https://manpages.debian.org/trixie/dgit/dgit.7.en.html#GITATTRIBUTES">we cannot support <code>.gitattributes</code></a> which modify files during git checkin and checkout. <code>.gitattributes</code> cause the meaning of a git tree to depend on the context, in possibly arbitrary ways, so the conversion from git to source package wouldn’t be stable. And, worse, some source packages might not to be representable in git at all.
</p><p>Another example: Maintainers often have existing git branches for their packages, generated with pre-dgit tooling which is less careful and less principled than ours. That can result in discrepancies between git and dsc, which need to be resolved before a proper git-based upload can succeed.
</p><p>That some maintainers use patches-unapplied, and some patches-unapplied, means that there <em>has</em> to be some kind of conversion to a standard git representation. Choosing the less-popular patches-applied format as the canonical form, means that <em>many</em> packages need their git representation converted. It also means that user- and outsider-facing branches from <code>{browse,git}.dgit.d.o</code> and <code>dgit clone</code> are not always compatible with maintainer branches on Salsa. User-contributed changes need cherry-picking rather than merging, or conversion back to the maintainer format. The good news is that dgit can automate much of this, and the manual parts are usually easy git operations.
</p><h2><a name="distributing-the-source-code-as-git">Distributing the source code as git</a></h2>
<p>Our source code management should be normal, modern, and based on git. That means the Debian Archive is obsolete and needs to be replaced with a set of git repositories.
</p><p>The replacement repository for source code formally released to Debian is <a href="https://browse.dgit.debian.org/"><code>*.dgit.debian.org</code></a>. This contains all the git objects for every git-based upload since 2013, including the signed tag for each released package version.
</p><p>The plan is that it will contain a git view of <em>every</em> uploaded Debian package, by centrally importing all legacy uploads into git.
</p><h2><a name="tracking-the-relevant-git-data-when-changes-are-made-in-the-legacy-archive">Tracking the relevant git data, when changes are made in the legacy Archive</a></h2>
<p>Currently, many critical source code management tasks are done by changes to the legacy Debian Archive, which works entirely with dsc files (and the associated tarballs etc). The contents of the Archive are therefore still an important source of truth. But, the Archive’s architecture means it cannot sensibly directly contain git data.
</p><p>To track changes made in the Archive, we added the <a href="https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-controlfields.html#s-f-dgit"><code>Dgit:</code></a> field to the <code>.dsc</code> of a git-based upload (2013). This declares which git commit this package was converted from. and where those git objects can be obtained.
</p><p>Thus, given a Debian Source Package from a git-based upload, it is possible for the new git tooling to obtain the equivalent git objects. If the user is going to work in git, there is no need for any tarballs to be downloaded: the git data could be obtained from the depository using the git protocol.
</p><p>The <a href="https://browse.dgit.debian.org/libsdl2-ttf.git/tag/?h=archive/debian/2.24.0%2bdfsg-3">signed</a> <a href="https://browse.dgit.debian.org/libsdl2-ttf.git/tag/?h=debian/2.24.0%2bdfsg-3">tags</a>, available from the git depository, have <a href="https://manpages.debian.org/trixie/git-debpush/tag2upload.5.en.html">standardised metdata</a> which gives traceability back to the uploading Debian contributor.
</p><h2><a name="why-.dgit.debian.org-is-not-salsa">Why *.dgit.debian.org is not Salsa</a></h2>
<p>We need a git <em>depository</em> - a formal, reliable and permanent git repository of source code actually released to Debian.
</p><p>Git forges like Gitlab can be very convenient. But Gitlab is not sufficiently secure, <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/429516">and</a> <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/472646">too</a> <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/581752">full</a> <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/581897">of</a> <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/217231">bugs</a>, to be the principal and only archive of all our source code. (The “open core” business model of the Gitlab corporation, and the constant-churn development approach, are <a href="https://mako.cc/writing/hill-free_tools.html">critical</a> underlying problems.)
</p><p>Our git depository lacks forge features like Merge Requests. But:
</p><ul><li>It is dependable, both in terms of reliability and security.
</li><li>It is append-only: once something is pushed, it is permanently recorded.
</li><li>Its access control is precisely that of the Debian Archive.
</li><li>Its ref namespace is standardised and corresponds to Debian releases.
</li><li>Pushes are authorised by PGP signatures, not ssh keys, so traceable.
</li></ul>
<p>The dgit git depository outlasted Alioth and it may well outlast Salsa.
</p><p>We need <em>both</em> a good forge, and the <code>*.dgit.debian.org</code> formal git depository.
</p><h2><a name="roadmap">Roadmap</a></h2>
<h2><a name="in-progress">In progress</a></h2>
<p>Right now we are quite focused on <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/tag2upload"><strong>tag2upload</strong></a>.
</p><p>We are working hard on eliminating the remaining issues that we feel need to be addressed before declaring the service out of beta.
</p><h2><a name="future-technology">Future Technology</a></h2>
<h3><a name="whole-archive-dsc-importer">Whole-archive dsc importer</a></h3>
<p>Currently, the git depository only has git data for git-based package updates (tag2upload and dgit push). Legacy dput-based uploads are not currently present there. This means that the git-based and legacy uploads must be resolved client-side, by <code>dgit clone</code>.
</p><p>We will want to start importing legacy uploads to git.
</p><p>Then downstreams and users will be able to get the source code for any package simply with <code>git clone</code>, even if the maintainer is using legacy upload tools like dput.
</p><h3><a name="support-for-git-based-uploads-to-security.debian.org">Support for git-based uploads to security.debian.org</a></h3>
<p>Security patching is a task which would particularly benefit from better and more formal use of git. git-based approaches to applying and backporting security patches are much more convenient than messing about with actual patch files.
</p><p>Currently, one can use git to help prepare a security upload, but it often involves starting with a dsc import (which lacks the proper git history) or figuring out a package maintainer’s unstandardised git usage conventions on Salsa.
</p><p>And it is not possible to properly perform the security release <em>as git</em>.
</p><h3><a name="internal-debian-consumers-switch-to-getting-source-from-git">Internal Debian consumers switch to getting source from git</a></h3>
<p>Buildds, QA work such as lintian checks, and so on, could be simpler if they don’t need to deal with source packages.
</p><p>And since git is actually the canonical form, we want them to use it directly.
</p><h3><a name="problems-for-the-distant-future">Problems for the distant future</a></h3>
<p>For decades, Debian has been built around source packages. Replacing them is a long and complex process. Certainly source packages are going to continue to be supported for the foreseeable future.
</p><p>There are no doubt going to be unanticipated problems. There are also foreseeable issues: for example, perhaps there are packages that work very badly when represented in git. We think we can rise to these challenges as they come up.
</p><h2><a name="mindshare-and-adoption---please-help">Mindshare and adoption - please help!</a></h2>
<p>We and our users are very pleased with our technology. It is convenient and highly dependable.
</p><p><code>dgit</code> in particular is superb, even if we say so ourselves. As technologists, we have been very focused on building good software, but it seems we have fallen short in the marketing department.
</p><h2><a name="a-rant-about-publishing-the-source-code">A rant about publishing the source code</a></h2>
<p><strong>git is the preferred form for modification</strong>.
</p><p>Our upstreams are overwhelmingly using git. We are overwhelmingly using git. It is a scandal that for many packages, Debian does not properly, formally and officially publish the git history.
</p><p><em>Properly</em> publishing the source code as git means publishing it in a way that means that anyone can <em>automatically</em> and <em>reliably</em> obtain <em>and build</em> the <em>exact</em> source code corresponding to the binaries. The test is: could you use that to build a derivative?
</p><p>Putting a package <a href="https://dep-team.pages.debian.net/deps/dep18/">in git on Salsa</a> is often a good idea, but it is not sufficient. No standard branch structure git on Salsa is enforced, nor should it be (so it can’t be automatically and reliably obtained), the tree is not in a standard form (so it can’t be automatically built), and is not <em>necessarily identical</em> to the source package. So <code>Vcs-Git</code> fields, and git from Salsa, will never be sufficient to make a derivative.
</p><p><strong>Debian is not publishing the source code!</strong>
</p><p>The time has come for proper publication of source code by Debian to no longer be a minority sport. Every maintainer of a package whose upstream is using git (which is nearly all packages nowadays) should be basing their work on upstream git, and properly publishing that via tag2upload or dgit.
</p><p>And it’s not even difficult! The modern git-based tooling provides a far superior upload experience.
</p><h3><a name="a-common-misunderstanding">A common misunderstanding</a></h3>
<p><strong>dgit push is not an alternative to gbp pq or quilt. Nor is tag2upload.</strong> These upload tools <em>complement your existing git workflow</em>. They replace and improve source package building/signing and the subsequent dput. If you are using one of the usual git layouts on salsa, and your package is in good shape, you can adopt tag2upload and/or dgit push right away.
</p><p><code>git-debrebase</code> is distinct and <em>does</em> provides an alternative way to manage your git packaging, do your upstream rebases, etc.
</p><h2><a name="documentation">Documentation</a></h2>
<p>Debian’s documentation all needs to be updated, including particularly instructions for packaging, to recommend use of git-first workflows. Debian should not be importing git-using upstreams’ “release tarballs” into git. (Debian outsiders who discover this practice are typically horrified.) We should use <em>only</em> upstream git, work only in git, and properly release (and publish) in git form.
</p><p>We, the git transition team, are experts in the technology, and can provide good suggestions. But we do not have the bandwidth to also engage in the massive campaigns of education and documentation updates that are necessary — especially given that (as with any programme for change) many people will be sceptical or even hostile.
</p><p>So we would greatly appreciate help with writing and outreach.

				<h2>I announced my divorce on Instagram and then AI impersonated me</h2>
				<time>December 20, 2025</time>
		
				
<p>After maintaining a total stance of public silence for months, I recently publicly announced my unexpected divorce on Instagram. I shared a picture of the divorce cake that my friends got for me, and shared a brief essay I had drafted the day before about the news. I had to edit it down slightly from my original draft to fit Instagram’s character limits. You can see the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DSQwb-hkTPb/">Instagram post</a> here. And for the record, here is the photo of the cake and what I wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
<div><p>Two weeks before our ninth anniversary in April my husband told me he wanted a divorce. I was completely blindsided. Going through an unexpected divorce has been the most brutal, humiliating, and traumatizing process I’ve ever experienced. In an instant my life trajectory changed. The markers of security that I had clung to following the previous year’s burst appendix hospitalization and my Dad dying in the same hospital where I was being treated suddenly vanished. Being forced to sell our house, the address I lived in longer than any other place in my life because of my complicated childhood, was one of the most devastating parts of this hellish timeline.</p><p>I don’t know if I would have survived the last several months were it not for my friends, those from home or around the world, those I’ve known for decades and those I’ve only recently met in the process of beginning to rebuild my life. Having friends from all ages, backgrounds, and circumstances has been a lifesaver because it turns out a lot of people have also gone through similar traumas that turned their lives upside down, who have a lot of counsel and camaraderie to offer.</p><p>Enough people have received the memo about divorce etiquette to ask whether a person’s divorce is a “congratulations” or “sorry” situation. Until recently the latter has been more applicable, but now that the state has decreed that my divorce is official I mostly feel a sense of overwhelming relief tempering my deep grief, and trying to stay focused on what’s next.</p><p>A divorce you don’t see coming really does a number on your sense of worth and identity. I did not choose to end my marriage, but I am humbled and struck by how many choices I get to make about my future. I am spending a lot of time thinking about the people and places, principles and pleasures that I want to prioritize in this next phase of my life.</p><p>Over the last several months I’ve been grateful for my friends’ unwavering belief that things will be better on the other side of this journey. And who I am to argue with my friends? They are smart and I think they love me and I definitely love them. So with that, I’m officially in my hot divorcee era. WATCH THIS SPACE.</p></div>

<p>I hit post, and cross-posted it to Facebook. I also shared the Instagram link on <a href="http://glammr.us/">glammr.us</a> (the main Mastodon server that caters to GLAM workers), which is where I took a lot of my <a href="https://eiratansey.com/2018/01/07/this-machine-coddles-fascists/">post-Twitter energy</a> a few years ago.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A few days after posting, I was looking at the Mastodon app, Toot, on my phone (yes, all of the terminology around Mastodon is that embarrassing). And I noticed something I definitely did not remember writing. In the app, all the original text from my post was pulled in along with some additional text following my sign-off line of WATCH THIS SPACE that I certainly didn’t author. It also sounded very AI-generated. Here’s what I saw:</p>



<figure><a href="https://eiratansey.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_3363.png"><img decoding="async" width="992" height="2146" src="https://eiratansey.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_3363-edited.png" alt="" srcset="https://eiratansey.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_3363-edited.png 992w, https://eiratansey.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_3363-edited-139x300.png 139w, https://eiratansey.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_3363-edited-473x1024.png 473w, https://eiratansey.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_3363-edited-768x1661.png 768w, https://eiratansey.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_3363-edited-710x1536.png 710w, https://eiratansey.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_3363-edited-947x2048.png 947w" sizes="(max-width: 992px) 100vw, 992px"></a></figure>



<p>Here’s the AI-generated text I didn’t write:</p>



<blockquote>

</blockquote>



<p>After talking with my friend Ruth (one of the <a href="http://glammr.us/">glammr.us</a> admins and a much smarter tech person than myself) and finding this <a href="https://www.404media.co/instagram-is-generating-inaccurate-seo-bait-for-your-posts/">recent story from 404 Media</a>, I realized that somehow my post had been targeted for Instagram’s AI-generated SEO bait. If you go to the original Instagram post and view the page source, you’ll see that there is both the description text from above, along with a whole bevvy of keywords like “self-discovery” and “finding happiness.”</p>



<figure><a href="https://eiratansey.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-20-at-7.13.15-PM.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="394" src="https://eiratansey.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-20-at-7.13.15-PM-1024x394.png" alt="A screenshot of Chrome's developer tools showing the AI-generated slop with a pink &quot;WTF&quot; drawn over the top" srcset="https://eiratansey.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-20-at-7.13.15-PM-1024x394.png 1024w, https://eiratansey.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-20-at-7.13.15-PM-300x115.png 300w, https://eiratansey.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-20-at-7.13.15-PM-768x295.png 768w, https://eiratansey.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-20-at-7.13.15-PM-1536x590.png 1536w, https://eiratansey.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-20-at-7.13.15-PM.png 1912w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>While I am sure buried deep in some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-user_license_agreement">EULA</a> there is some bullshit allowing Meta to get away with this, I was never explicitly informed about this possibility or asked to review this AI-generated text. Meanwhile, as of today when I look at Instagram’s posting settings, I see that there is a button that requires you to label any AI-generated content you post as the end user, but obviously there is no such obligation in the other direction.</p>



<p>One of the things I gave up long ago about being an extremely online woman who is a <a href="https://tressiemc.com/essays-2/academic-outrage-when-the-culture-wars-go-digital/">micro-public figure</a> with a weird name are any assumptions about privacy. It’s why I drafted the brief essay for my announcement in advance, because I know that once I hit post on anything on the internet I can never unring that bell. I have been writing in the public sphere long enough to know that things that I write are routinely misrepresented by others (a lesson I relearn every time I check some of the citations of my work via Google Scholar updates).&nbsp;</p>



<p>But what I vehemently object to in this situation is the use of the first-person voice without my review or permission. The language used in the description makes it sound as if I wrote it (“In this post, I share my personal journey…”). Because I have fiercely protected my authorship throughout my life and what my name is attached to, any generative AI writing that purports to be in my voice without my informed consent is a profound violation of my authorial voice, agency, and frankly it feels like fraud or impersonation. As an archivist who has spent almost twenty years thinking about accuracy in information, it makes my skin crawl that there is a metadata field with the sole purpose of generating SEO-engagement purporting to be my voice that doesn’t disclose the authorship was actually non-consensual AI.</p>



<p>In recent days I’ve noticed this kind of “some people are saying” text showing up in my search results, especially related to Reddit threads. For example, a list of Google search results showing Reddit threads might show some description like “Some users are discussing the challenges of making a mug cake that doesn’t taste rubbery.” But even if this description had been in the third-person voice such as “This woman discusses her divorce and its impact on her….” my anger would remain.</p>



<p>Because what this AI-generated SEO slop formed from an extremely vulnerable and honest place shows is that women’s pain is still not taken seriously. The tone of the post is laden in the absolute worst therapy/wellness culture cliches (“Follow along as I share my story and insights on rebuilding, self-care, and finding happiness after divorce”) which is language that I abhor since it often trivializes women’s pain. I also object to the flattening of the contours of my particular divorce. There are really important distinctions between the experiences of women who initiate their own divorces versus women who come to a mutual agreement with their spouses to end the marriage versus women, like me, who are completely blindsided by their husbands’ decisions to suddenly end the marriage. All divorces do involve self-discovery and rebuilding your life, but the ways in which you begin down that path often involve dramatically different circumstances.&nbsp;</p>



<p>My story is absolutely layered through with trauma, humiliation, and sudden financial insecurity and I truly resent that this AI-generated garbage erases the deliberately uncomfortable and provocative words I chose to include in my original framing. If my story ends up becoming inspiring to others, that’s great, but that’s not why I share my pain on the internet. I share my pain publicly as a gesture of solidarity with other people, but especially women, who have been profoundly traumatized by those they thought they could love and trust. Having my pain witnessed and acknowledged is part of how I am healing while also letting other people know they are not alone. I have to externalize my pain in regular intervals right now because if I internalize it any more it might actually destroy me. Forcing an “inspiration” vibe onto what I posted feels tone deaf at best, and like toxic positivity at worst.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>We already know that in a patriarchal society, women’s pain is dismissed, belittled, and ignored. This kind of AI-generated language also depoliticizes patriarchal power dynamics. Thinkers like <a href="https://safiyaunoble.com/">Dr. Safiya Noble</a> have been warning us for years that the prejudices carried by the people who design and maintain internet infrastructure continually shapes how we view and think about women and girls in society. I already felt immense pain and anger by the decision of my husband to suddenly end our marriage. And now I feel a double sense of violation that the men who design and maintain and profit from the internet have literally impersonated my voice behind the closed doors of hidden metadata to tell a more palatable version of the story they think will sell.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="auto">There are <a href="https://github.com/ibaryshnikov/android-iced-example/blob/master/NativeActivity">NativeActivity</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ibaryshnikov/android-iced-example/blob/master/GameActivity">GameActivity</a> examples here.</p>
<p dir="auto">Based on several other examples:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>na-mainloop</code> and <code>agdk-mainloop</code> from

<li><a href="https://github.com/rust-mobile/rust-android-examples/tree/main/na-winit-wgpu">na-winit-wgpu</a>
from <code>rust-android-examples</code></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/iced-rs/iced/tree/0.14/examples/integration">integration</a>

<p dir="auto">You can also run most of the examples from iced.
For this omit the scene rendering part and set the background of the root container.</p>

<ul dir="auto">
<li>window doesn't resize on show/hide soft keyboard</li>
<li>how to change input language of soft keyboard</li>
<li>ime is not supported</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Copy/paste and show/hide soft keyboard is implemented by calling Java</p>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Building and running</h2><a id="user-content-building-and-running" aria-label="Permalink: Building and running" href="#building-and-running"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Check <code>android-activity</code> crate for detailed instructions.
During my tests I was running the following command and using android studio afterwards:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="export ANDROID_NDK_HOME=&quot;path/to/ndk&quot;
export ANDROID_HOME=&quot;path/to/sdk&quot;

rustup target add x86_64-linux-android
cargo install cargo-ndk

cargo ndk -t x86_64 -o app/src/main/jniLibs/  build"><pre><span>export</span> ANDROID_NDK_HOME=<span><span>"</span>path/to/ndk<span>"</span></span>
<span>export</span> ANDROID_HOME=<span><span>"</span>path/to/sdk<span>"</span></span>

rustup target add x86_64-linux-android
cargo install cargo-ndk

cargo ndk -t x86_64 -o app/src/main/jniLibs/  build</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">My setup is the following:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>archlinux 6.9.6</li>
<li>jdk-openjdk 22</li>
<li>target api 35</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How it works</h2><a id="user-content-how-it-works" aria-label="Permalink: How it works" href="#how-it-works"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Thanks to <code>android-activity</code> we can already build android apps in Rust, and
key crates such as <code>winit</code> and <code>wgpu</code> also support building for android.
<code>iced</code> doesn't support android out of the box, but it can be integrated with
existing graphics pipelines, as shown in
<a href="https://github.com/iced-rs/iced/tree/0.13.1/examples/integration">integration</a> example.
As a result, it was possible to convert existing example running <code>winit</code> + <code>wgpu</code> to
use <code>iced</code> on top.</p>
