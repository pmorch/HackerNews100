    <img src="https://christianselig.com/2024/10/juno-removed/hero.jpeg" alt="Screenshot from App Store Connect showing Juno as 'Removed from App Store'" loading="lazy">

<p>For those not aware, a few months ago after reaching out to me, <a href="https://christianselig.com/2024/06/announcing-juno-2/">YouTube contacted the App Store</a> stating that Juno does not adhere to YouTube guidelines and modifies the website in a way they don’t approve of, and alludes to their trademarks and iconography.</p>
<p>I don’t personally agree with this, as Juno is just a web view, and acts as little more than a browser extension that modifies CSS to make the website and video player look more “visionOS” like. No logos are placed other than those already on the website, and the “for YouTube” suffix is <a href="https://developers.google.com/youtube/terms/branding-guidelines">permitted in their branding guidelines</a>. Juno also doesn’t block ads in any capacity, for the curious.</p>
<p>I stated as much to YouTube, they wouldn’t really clarify or budge any, and as a result of both parties not being able to come to a conclusion I received an email a few minutes ago from Apple that Juno has been removed from the App Store.</p>
<p>Juno was a fun hobby project for me to build. As a developer I wanted to get some experience building for the Vision Pro, and as a user I wanted a nice way to watch YouTube on this cool new device. As a result, I really enjoyed building Juno, but it was always something I saw as fundamentally a little app I built for fun.</p>
<p>Because of that, I have zero desire to spin this into a massive fight akin to what happened with Reddit years ago (more than I’ve fought in emails over the last few months). That’s kind of the opposite of fun. I hope that’s understandable.</p>
<p>For those who have Juno, to my knowledge it should continue to work fine until/unless YouTube updates in some fashion that breaks stuff. Sorry it had to end this way, I had some really cool stuff planned for it that I think would have been a lot of fun! It’s been genuinely awesome hearing all the kind words from Vision Pro users who have loved the app.</p>

<h2><a href="https://wumpus-cave.net/post/2024/10/2024-10-01-death-of-cobol/index.html">Cobol Has Been "Dead" For So Long, My Grandpa Wrote About It</a></h2>
<h2>2024-10-01</h2>
<hr>
<p>
<a href="https://wumpus-cave.net/post/2024/10/death_of_cobol1.jpg">  <img src="https://wumpus-cave.net/post/2024/10/death_of_cobol1.jpg" alt="Cobol is Dead">
</a></p>
<p>
In June of 1992, my grandfather had an article published in Technical Support 
magazine proclaiming the death of Cobol. It naturally contains some of the 
buzzwords of the time, such as fourth-generation programming language (4GL). If 
you’re not familiar with that term, suffice it to say that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth-generation_programming_language#Examples">Wikipedia 
page</a>
lists several examples, and Cobol has outlasted most of them.</p>
<p>
There’s a text version of the article available in archives of the 
NaSPA: <a href="http://www.naspa.net/magazine/1992/t9206003.txt">http://www.naspa.net/magazine/1992/t9206003.txt</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
The word <em>dead</em> would seem to have shades of meaning. Perhaps Cobol is not dead; it may be a Zombie. So, something can be dead and yet not gone? Right! Cobol is an excellent example of that phenomenon. COBOL is probably not alone; there are, I suspect, even some vestiges of Autocoder still extant. Autocoder, for those under 45 who may have never heard the term, was a precursor of COBOL. It is unlikely anyone would argue very forcefully that Autocoder is not dead, yet some
remnants of it are probably still with us.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
As you might notice, he had a dry wit. There was one time I was able to 
reflect one of his retorts right back at him, and my grandma was so proud; the 
student had become the master.</p>
<p>
There was one thing that kept the Cobol zombie shambling along, and that’s the 
Y2K problem. Make no mistake: as much as it was hyped in the news at the time, 
and as much of a nothingburger it seemed to be, Y2K was a gigantic problem. 
It necessitated training up a new generation of Cobol programmers. That may 
have kept Cobol going for a while longer.</p>
<p>
These days, I avoid the term “dead” for programming languages at all. If 
they ever had a large installed base, then they never die. They have long 
tails where they trail off into obscurity with no junior programmers learning it.</p>
<p>
My grandpa died on Sept 1, 2024 at 91 years of age. Officially, he died of 
pneumonia. My grandma had died the previous April, and he had asked not to 
receive any treatment.</p>

				<span>I</span>
			</span>n the old</span>  chapel of a former Christian Science church in San Francisco, late-afternoon sun pours orange through the windows and several giant servers are hard at work. The tall, black towers fill two large alcoves and their cooling fans emit a serene, industrial hum as blue lights blink. Each flicker, says the man in charge of this operation, Brewster Kahle, is a virtual patron of the enormous digital library called the <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/internet-archive/" id="auto-tag_internet-archive" data-tag="internet-archive">Internet Archive</a>.</p>



<p>
	Across the room, near where the pulpit would be, sits a sculpture of chunky, red, antiquated computer monitors flashing bygone web pages — a snapshot of the World Wide Web in 1997, and the earliest entry to the Internet Archive’s enormous digital collection.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	But it’s the statues — lined up against the walls and in the pews — that grab your attention. Hundreds of miniature replicas of past and present Internet Archive employees. Three more just arrived yesterday, Kahle, 63, tells me last fall as he points out his own. The statue’s wire-frame glasses match his; the white hair, however, is more tight and curled than the tufts that halo his actual head, making him look a bit like Doc Brown from <em>Back to the Future</em>. Kahle’s statue carries a book in one hand and a computer mouse in the other, the latter held out like an offering.&nbsp;

	</p>




<p>
	“Nobody makes any money here, right?” says Kahle. “So you do this for some other reason. Why do you do it? Because you want to be proud of what you do.”

</p>



<p>
	I ask what you have to do to earn a statue.</p>



<p>
	“You have to work at the Archive for three years,” replies Kahle, who founded the Archive as a nonprofit in 1996. “You have to spend your time doing a public service. Oh, did I tell you?” he adds as a casual aside. “The major record labels are trying to destroy us.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	To many, the Internet Archive is its own kind of sanctuary — a vestige of a bygone internet built on openness and access, a Silicon Valley standout interested not in series funding or shareholder value, but the preservation of any piece of the cultural record it can get. But to the corporations and people that own the copyrights to large swaths of that record, the Internet Archive is like a pirate ship stuffed with digital plunder. Two lawsuits have brought these long-simmering tensions to the courts and public consciousness, with financial repercussions in the hundreds of millions that could bring down the internet’s greatest library.</p>



	<h2>
		<strong>“The</strong> <strong>Library of Alexandria for the Digital Age”</strong>	</h2>



<p>
	Before founding the Internet Archive, Kahle worked as a computer scientist, making major contributions to personal computing and the early internet during the Eighties and Nineties.

<p>
	With the Archive, he says, “The whole idea was to build the Library of Alexandria for the digital age. To build universal access to all knowledge.”</p>



<p>
	The Archive is best known for its preservation of the ephemeral expanses of the World Wide Web, available through its one-of-a-kind archive/search engine, the Wayback Machine. But this is just one facet of its collection: Working with museums, libraries, and individual donors and contributors, the Archive has amassed more than 145 petabytes of material (if <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/terabytes-gigabytes-amp-petabytes-how-big-are-they-4125169" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">you took more than</a> 4,000 digital photos every day for the rest of your life, you might end up with 1 petabyte). Much of this material is obsolete or out of print — books, microfilm and microfiche, old software, video games, obscure VHS tapes, TV news programs, historic radio shows, and hundreds of thousands of concert recordings.&nbsp;

<p>
	“It’s a research library. It’s there to record and make available an accurate version of the past,” Kahle says. “Otherwise, we’ll end up with a George Orwell world where the past can be manipulated and erased.”

	</p>




<p>
	But this work has long rankled one of the most powerful forces in the United States — rights holders — and the threat of copyright lawsuits has always loomed over the Archive. Lawrence Lessig, the legal scholar and Archive ally, even predicted Kahle would wind up in court in a 2001 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/29/business/new-economy-library-web-pages-that-warms-cockles-wired-heart-beats-library.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"><em>New York Times</em></a> interview, days after the Wayback Machine launched.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	It took nearly two decades — during which the Archive occasionally faced smaller legal challenges — but Lessig was right. In June 2020, several book publishers sued the Internet Archive following the launch of its pandemic-era National Emergency Library, which made its collection of scanned books available to borrow freely and without restrictions amid school, university, and library closures. The publishers claimed mass, willful copyright infringement and <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/internet-archive-copyright-infringement-lawsuit-1234703776/">won a summary judgment</a> in the lower courts last March. (The Archive appealed, but <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/internet-archive-loses-appeal-book-publishers-copyright-case-1235095174/">lost again</a> earlier this month.)</p>

<p>
	The same day the district court settlement was announced in August 2023, a set of music-industry clients — led by major record labels Universal Music Group and Sony Music — <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/record-labels-sue-internet-archive-412-million-copyright-infringement-lawsuit-1234806058/">filed their own copyright-infringement lawsuit</a> over another Archive endeavor, <a href="https://great78.archive.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the Great 78 Project</a>: an unprecedented effort to digitize 78 rpm records, the obsolete shellac discs that emerged in the 1890s and remained the dominant format for audio recordings until vinyl surpassed them in the 1940s and 1950s.</p>



<p>
	The Great 78 Project bills itself as a “community project for the preservation, research and discovery of 78 rpm records”; the labels, in their <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/lawsuit/" id="auto-tag_lawsuit" data-tag="lawsuit">lawsuit</a>, call it an “illegal record store.” They claim the availability of these digitized 78s constitutes “wholesale theft of generations of music,” with “preservation and research” used as a “smokescreen.” They further argue that the project “undermines the value” of the original recordings, and “displace[s]” authorized streams that actually generate royalties and revenue.</p>



<p>
	Attorneys for the labels forwarded interview requests to the Recording Industry Association of America, which declined to comment for this article. Ken Doroshow, chief legal officer for the RIAA, previously said that the suit was meant to address “the industrial-scale infringement of some of the most iconic recordings ever made.”&nbsp;

	</p>




<p>
	If you want to explore the old, weird expanses of recorded-sound history, there’s no better resource than the Great 78 Project. To build it, the Internet Archive contracted the services of expert audio preservationist George Blood, whose team has digitized and uploaded (with detailed metadata) more than 400,000 recordings since 2017. Click around, filter by year, genre, language, and you’ll find an infinite scroll of discs — most issued by long-defunct labels like Victor, Vocalion, Edison, Oriole, Okeh, and Brunswick — their front labels photographed and laid out in a grid, each one leading to a web page with a straight rip of the crackly recording. A folk, blues, or country tune, a lost jazz gem or minor big-band hit, a Yiddish comedy bit, Hungarian opera, Argentine tango, polka, foxtrot, gospel, hymns, or even just the sound of a person laughing because that’s what people wanted to hear when it became possible to record a human voice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	Blood, who is also named as a defendant in the lawsuit, calls this “preservation of the cultural record” one of the “great accomplishments” of the Great 78 Project. “Probably 95 percent or more of this content is not available anywhere,” he tells <em>Rolling Stone.</em> “Whether they were small labels, or obscure pressings, they have been lost to time.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	Of these hundreds of thousands of recordings, the record labels sued over the uploading of 4,142 (an amended complaint from earlier this year added 1,393 recordings to the initial 2,749). Most are by recognizable legacy acts whose music is still widely available: Billie Holiday, Louis Armstrong, Elvis Presley, Chuck Berry, Hank Williams, Frank Sinatra, Benny Goodman, Ernest Tubb, and Peggy Lee. (These recordings are now no longer available on the Great 78 Project, per Kahle.) The potential damages are staggering — $150,000 per recording (the statutory maximum for an infringing incident), with a possible total of more than $621 million. If the labels win, with a broad enough judgment, it could end the Internet Archive.&nbsp;(The most recent action in the case was a private mediation session between the parties earlier this week. As it stands, the case is moving forward with the discovery phase scheduled to last through most of 2025.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	Above the doorway to Kahle’s office is a street sign: Librarian Place. With a self-deprecating drone, Kahle ticks off some of the achievements hanging on his wall: “I’m in the Internet Hall of Fame, American Academy of Arts and Sciences, American Antiquarian Society.” Not missing a beat, he marvels at the new distinction these lawsuits seem to have foisted upon him: “And suddenly we are bringing down capitalism.”&nbsp;

	</p>




	<h2>
		<strong>“Openness Is the Way to Go”</strong>	</h2>



<p>
	Kahle grew up in Scarsdale, New York, the son of a mechanical engineer who instilled in him a post-WWII ethos — “You can <em>build things</em>, you can try to make things better” — that later cross-pollinated with hippie idealism as Kahle studied engineering and computer science at MIT in the late Seventies and early Eighties. Kahle bolstered his studies with courses in history, Buddhism, and library science, even as many of his MIT peers treated the humanities like gym class.</p>



<p>
	Kahle was enamored with libraries, and they informed his two major contributions to the early internet era. In the Eighties, he joined the supercomputer company Thinking Machines, where he helped develop the Wide Area Information Server (WAIS), an early online publishing system and search engine modeled after the way people asked questions of librarians. His next company, Alexa Internet, founded in 1996, was named for the Library of Alexandria and crawled the web for information to create a quasi-card catalog for the internet.&nbsp;</p>

</div></figure>



<p>
	During our conversations, Kahle name-checks a variety of 20th century texts such as “As We May Think,” <em>Computer Lib/Dream Machines,</em> <em>Practical Digital Libraries,</em> all of which conjure similar visions of a future where information, and people, are liberated through technology and libraries. Kahle believed the internet could replace the world he grew up in, where information was confined to a few TV channels, textbooks, and newspapers. That was a “game of very few winners,” he likes to say. He wanted to make a game with many.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	When WAIS spun off into its own company in the early Nineties, Kahle had the chance to develop it further with Steve Jobs at NeXT. He declined. Jobs, says Kahle, “was not interested” in building out WAIS with search tools that were fully open to the public.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	“Openness is the way to go,” Kahle says, “even though I won’t become as rich, because who cares about getting rich? How do we make it so there’s lots of writers, publishers, booksellers, and libraries that have their own niches? How do we make it so it’s many-to-many-to-many, without any central points of control?”

	Kahle still got rich. WAIS sold to AOL for $15 million in 1995. And Amazon, enchanted by Alexa’s web-crawling capabilities, bought it for a reported $250 million in stock in 1999. (As part of the deal, Amazon agreed to keep donating those web crawls to the Internet Archive for preservation.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	Though Kahle’s ideals have never wavered, his creations were subsumed by a Silicon Valley behemoth feeding off all things antithetical to his vision of an open internet: advertising models, insane capital markets, and the ultimate “poison” (as he calls it), monopoly power. This was how you got tight controls on information, locked up behind towering paywalls. A game of few winners.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	“We’ve taken the promise of the internet and shafted it,” Kahle says. “We convinced people — I was one of them — to turn to their screens to answer questions.”</p>

<p>
	So, as the internet zagged, Kahle took his millions and brilliance and built his bastion. And though he spurned Silicon Valley’s hypercapitalist bloodlust, he continued to embrace its swashbuckling, sometimes heedless pursuit of a goal. To grow the Internet Archive, that meant dancing around and prodding the limits of copyright law. Though to the Archive’s detractors, this often looked like blatant disregard.</p>



<p>
	In their lawsuit, the labels hit the Archive for its “long history of opposing, fighting, and ignoring copyright law, proclaiming that their zealotry serves the public good. In reality, Defendants are nothing more than mass infringers.”</p>



<p>
	Still, “serving the public good” seemed to earn the Archive some leeway. Jessica Litman, a University of Michigan Law School professor and copyright expert, notes that the Wayback Machine was able to skirt major challenges because it “became a really well-accepted resource,” and no one else (including the Library of Congress) was willing to put up the money, or take the copyright risk, to index the web.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	When rights holders did demand something be taken down, the Internet Archive obliged: “Always with respect and in conversation,” Kahle says. Sometimes, a compromise was reached, like in 2005, when the Internet Archive and the Grateful Dead found a solution to keep the band’s myriad concert recordings available on the “Live Music Archive.”

	</p>




<p>
	Kahle shared a kind of copyright philosophy at a 2019 conference. “Try not to cause other people to feel like they’re being taken advantage of,” he told the crowd. “If that doesn’t happen, they won’t come after you. If they feel like they’re being taken advantage of, they’ll throw things at you, like lawyers… I think we just need to proceed and do the right thing. Don’t do things that smell bad.”&nbsp;</p>

</div></figure>



<p>
	But to many, the Internet Archive always smelled bad. “That’s the issue with Brewster,” says Neil Turkewitz, a former executive vice president, international of the RIAA. “It’s the hubris that flows out of Silicon Valley, and he’s got it in spades: That you can make your own laws that determine your norms of conduct if you have a higher ideal.”</p>



<p>
	Dennis Spragg, director of the Glenn Miller archives and the estate’s licensing coordinator, colorfully says he’ll refrain from using the word “thief” to describe the Archive’s activities, because “that’s a judgmental term.” Instead, he settles on a fictional Latin legal descriptor: “<em>Habeas grabus</em>. In other words: I have it, I grab it.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	“They’ve really gotten under the skin of a lot of people,” he adds. “And there are movements among rights holders to get tough on them.”</p>



<p>
	A $621 million lawsuit is tough, and both Turkewitz and Christiane Kinney, a music-industry lawyer and copyright specialist, think the labels have an open-and-shut case. There’s barely a “factual dispute,” Turkewitz argues. “It’s a straightforward reproduction-distribution copyright case … focused on records that are in the [labels’] catalog, being distributed, and available commercially.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	Kinney agrees: “They talk a great game. But the reality is, Bing Crosby’s ‘White Christmas’ — when do we not hear that?”</p>



<p>
	For the Internet Archive, the notion of fair use — legal carve-outs that allow people to use copyrighted works if the purpose is deemed sufficiently “transformative” or “educational” — is on the table; but that argument failed to sway the lower courts in the book-publishers’ case. The Copyright Act also gives libraries and archives some leeway to reproduce and distribute protected works, but there are debates over whether the Internet Archive, despite its assertions, is a library or just an online distribution hub. (In the book-publishers’ case, the appeals court held that the “IA does not perform the traditional functions of a library.”)

	</p>




<p>
	Litman does suggest the labels will have to prove the recordings the Internet Archive is hosting are the same ones labels are currently selling. “I think that’s a hard argument to make,” she says. “I would be shocked if they hadn’t gotten new copyright registrations for those recordings. What they’re exploiting is a remastered version of the older recordings. And what the Internet Archive is streaming are the original, very low-fi recordings.” For instance, the registration for a 1995 Count Basie compilation, <em>On the Upbeat,</em> contains two songs in the suit (“Every Tub” and “One O’Clock Jump”) and states the claim is for “New matter: compilation &amp; remix.”</p>



<p>
	Jennie Rose Halperin, a librarian and director of the advocacy group Library Futures (which <a href="https://www.libraryfutures.net/post/library-futures-files" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">filed an amicus brief</a> on behalf of the Archive in the book-publishers’ case), echoes this sentiment: “To make the assumption that listening to a 78 online with all the scratches and crackles is the same as going to Spotify and listening to a Frank Sinatra song is, frankly, a specious argument.”&nbsp;</p>



	<h2>
		<strong>“Too Important to Be Left to These Corporations”</strong>	</h2>



<p>
	In the Internet Archive’s lobby, a display case exhibits the history of the written word on one side (cuneiform tablets to laptops) and the history of recorded sound on the other (Edison cylinders to MP3s). A Victor Talking Machine from 1927 sits in between. Kahle asks if I’ve ever heard a 78 played on a mechanical phonograph before. I haven’t, so he grabs a disc from a small stack, places it on the turntable, and fixes a fresh needle to the stylus. I’m instructed to turn the crank on the side until it starts to resist. When it does, Kahle flips a switch, the turntable spins, and the little arrow on the rpm speedometer inches toward 78. The needle hits the shellac and starts to dance back and forth in the groove, pushing air through a diaphragm to amplify the sound.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	The record, 1947’s “Concerto Boogie” by the Tommy Edwards Trio, is a jazzy take on Edvard Grieg’s 1868 Piano Concerto in A minor. After a stern piano intro, the bass and guitar swing into a lush, goofy, gimlet-drunk groove. Standing in front of the Victor Talking Machine’s iconic, blooming horn, I flash a delighted, stupefied smile. Not because “Concerto Boogie” is the greatest song I’ve never heard (no offense to the Tommy Edwards Trio); I’ve just never listened to music this way, where each crackly note hits your face with a puff of air. I’ve stood in front of subwoofers as they huff and puff; I’ve felt bass vibrating through my body. But this is different, a breath out of the past.&nbsp;

	</p>




<p>
	Seventy-eights have long been essential, if not invaluable, to the preservation of early-20th-century sound. Under the best circumstances, an audio restoration or preservation project uses a master recording — the original tape, digital file, or, as was often the case in the early 1900s, metal plate — onto which the song was first cut. But few of those metal plates survive today. (Paramount Records, the prominent jazz and blues label that released music by Ma Rainey, Blind Lemon Jefferson, and Charley Patton, folded during the Depression and sold many of its masters as scrap metal.)</p>



<p>
	<strong>Tommy Edwards Trio – “Concerto Boogie”</strong></p>

<p>
	New 78s were manufactured through the Fifties, but the work of preserving those older discs was often eschewed by labels and taken up by individuals. When Columbia Records released the landmark 1961 Robert Johnson collection, <em>King of the Delta Blues Singers,</em> it didn’t pull the recordings from its own meticulously-kept vault: A few metal master plates were found in a factory, but most of the songs were sourced from 78s in the personal collections of two Columbia employees.</p>



<p>
	Individual collectors were essential to the growth of the Great 78 Project, too, from the 70,000 discs donated by the Danish collector Leif Druedahl to additional discs gifted from various institutions and libraries.</p>



<p>
	David Leonard, president of the Boston Public Library, which donated a large swath of its long-out-of-circulation sound collection, remembers the “praise and comments” from music lovers and nostalgic listeners that poured in when the collection went live.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	The labels do take care of plenty of old music, especially if it’s still profitable, like the 4,000-odd recordings over which they’re suing the Archive. But Nathan Georgitis, executive director of the Association for Recorded Sound Collections, a nonprofit committed to studying and preserving sound recordings, argues that record companies also have a way of letting “content go.” He alludes to the infamous 2008 fire at Universal Studios (a “big mishap with its vault”), which destroyed a warehouse filled with archival audiovisual material. And he notes that ARSC and some labels have occasionally found themselves at odds over “how to properly manage sound-recording collections — whether for the benefit of history and the enlightenment of mankind, or for, you know, economic profit.”&nbsp;

	</p>




<p>
	Lew Tucker, a computer scientist and peer of Kahle’s, understands the repercussions of those considerations. His father, Tommy Tucker, was a successful big-band leader in the Thirties and Forties, who mostly made his living on the road, but recorded hundreds of songs and even notched a few minor radio hits. Most of those recordings are now likely owned by Universal and Sony, but you won’t readily find them on CD or streaming.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	“There’s no commercial interest,” Tucker admits of his dad’s music. “But then it’s all locked up, nobody can hear it.”</p>



<p>
	You will find hundreds of Tommy Tucker recordings on the Great 78 Project, but none of them are part of the lawsuit. “That’s why preservation and archiving is too important to be left to these corporations that don’t see a way to monetize it,” Tucker says. “Brewster’s not monetizing it.”&nbsp;</p>



<figure><div>

<p>
	The Great 78 Project was ultimately designed for the Tommy Tuckers and the “Concerto Boogie”s. While 78 collectors helped build it, it’s a fundamental counter to their frequent pursuit of the rarest discs in the world. “It’s the long tail that people wanted,” says Kahle. “They wanted to know, ‘What did America sound like?’ We’re looking for not only the things people listened to, but the way they listened to it.”</p>



<p>
	And the Internet Archive probably could’ve done exactly this and never faced a $621 million lawsuit. That’s because the 2018 Music Modernization Act set up rules to allow people to share the plethora of recordings made before 1972 that aren’t available, for streaming or sale, through official channels. Rules that, say, a nonprofit internet library could follow if it wanted to digitize 78s containing tracks you’d never find on Spotify. They wouldn’t be allowed to monetize those recordings, and would have to conduct a “good faith, reasonable search” to ensure the original rights holder wasn’t making money off them. But, if they did that, then filed notice with the Copyright Office, waited 90 days, and no one objected, they’d be free to share.

	</p>




<p>
	The Internet Archive actually leapt to use these rules to add a slew of out-of-print vinyl LPs to its library. Its “Unlocked Recordings” collection now boasts more than 23,000 items, and prominently states that a “reasonable search” was conducted to determine they weren’t commercially available.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	But the labels, in their suit, argue no similar search was conducted for the Great 78 Project — proof, in their minds, that the Internet Archive knew the rules and willfully ignored them. (They also rebuffed the Archive’s claim about the “Unlocked Collection,” saying it never filed notice with the Copyright Office for any recording, and even hosted recordings by Paul McCartney, Jimi Hendrix, and Nina Simone at one time; if those recordings were available, they appear to have been taken down.)</p>



<p>
	Kahle insists that if the labels had said, “Hey, it’s so important that nobody be able to get that Benny Goodman 78,” the Internet Archive “would’ve worked with them.” The RIAA even contacted him in 2020 about possible infringement on the Great 78 Project, and while Kahle defended the endeavor in response, he also said they’d remove any specific titles if the labels asked. No such request came, just the lawsuit three years later.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	But the labels argue, this time, it wasn’t their responsibility to serve the Archive with such a list or copyright takedown notices. Even Litman, a great admirer of the Internet Archive, thinks it may have been “negligent” in failing to follow these rules. The Music Modernization Act “required [the Archive] to go through some hoops, and it didn’t,” she says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	I broach this with Kahle for the first time in the Archive’s lobby, across the room from the Victor Talking Machine, where he’s dropping a coin into a 1940s-era red electric jukebox. I punch a button for a Benny Goodman tune, but the machine’s finicky and brings up Louis Armstrong and Ella Fitzgerald’s “The Frim Fram Sauce” instead — one of the allegedly infringed-upon recordings on the Great 78 Project.

	</p>




<figure><div>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="The Frim Fram Sauce / Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong with Bob Haggart's Orchestra" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M3pxFP-rJIw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
</div></figure>



<p>
	I mention a presentation where Kahle discussed how the Archive checked if the VHS tapes it was preserving were commercially available on DVD. Were similar steps taken for the 78s?</p>



<p>
	“For LPs and CDs, that’s exactly what we do,” he says. “Seventy-eights, we asked around, we dealt with a lot of collectors, they just said it’s not a problem.” (In an email, Kahle further notes that the Great 78 Project “predates the MMA” and that the “record labels knew about it.”)</p>



<p>
	But there’s an even more blunt, obvious way of asking this question that doesn’t require knowledge of byzantine U.S. copyright law. Why didn’t the Internet Archive just think twice before making a song like “The Frim Fram Sauce” or Bing Crosby’s “White Christmas” — the most popular single of all time — available online for free? There wasn’t any concern about even a Frank Sinatra hit on 78?</p>



<p>
	For a few moments, it’s just the hearty horns of Bob Haggart and His Orchestra. “It wasn’t a problem,” Kahle says after a beat. “We talked to people, it wasn’t a problem.”</p>



<p>
	When I bring it up again later, Kahle argues that 78s are “obsolete” and that they made “faithful transcriptions of 78 rpm records that haven’t been for sale for 50 to 70 years… They’re so unrelated to what you would get on Spotify. People go to Spotify to find things that they enjoy [listening to]. When I want to listen to 78s, I listen to the wonderful work of Jack White—” and now he’s up from his recliner, out of his office, rooting around, and returning with Third Man’s luxurious<em> Rise and Fall of Paramount Records</em> box set, with its meticulously remastered tracks from the Paramount catalog newly pressed onto vinyl.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	“If you want to enjoy [the sound of] 78s, get this,” he insists.&nbsp;

	</p>




<p>
	Kahle says he believes the MMA exemptions have more to do with vinyl LPs released before 1972, which “still kinda sound like the music you’d listen to” on streaming or CD.</p>



<p>
	But to the labels, I point out, it doesn’t matter if it’s a straight transfer of “White Christmas” from an old shellac disc — it’s still “White Christmas,” and it’s available for people to stream for free.</p>



<p>
	“Well, do people?” Kahle retorts.</p>

<p>
	This question feels pertinent in a $621 million lawsuit. And the complaint does throw out some statistics — estimated play counts and downloads — for a few recordings. “White Christmas” allegedly has “tens of thousands” of downloads or streams on the Great 78 Project; Frank Sinatra’s “Young at Heart” has 2,300; Thelonious Monk’s “Monk’s Dream” has “hundreds.” For comparison, on Spotify, “Young at Heart” and “Monk’s Dream” have over 20 million plays each; and the two versions of “White Christmas” you’ll find on there have more than 1 billion cumulative listens.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	Kahle answers his own rhetorical question with the sharp, incredulous laugh that often carries his exasperation: “We’ve now run the experiment, and the answer is, they don’t!”&nbsp;</p>



	<h2>
		<strong>“They Failed to Ask the … Rights Holders for Permission”</strong>	</h2>



<p>
	Like Lew Tucker, John Mills II is also the son of a musician. His father, Donald Mills, was one of the founding members of the Mills Brothers, the pioneering Black vocal group with decades of hits going back to the 1920s. Mills grew up steeped in the world of the Mills Brothers, and it was only natural for him to become a musician. He’s always pursued his own projects, but he started singing with his dad in 1982, and after Donald’s death in 1999, he continued to carry on the Mills Brothers legacy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	“I always revered his artistry, his beautiful voice, the rapport that he had with his audiences,” Mills says. “I’m not gonna say no to that — I tried not to mess it up!”</p>



<p>
	The Mills Brothers made more than 2,000 recordings and, unlike the Tommy Tucker catalog, the vast majority of them are widely available. They’re still regularly licensed for video games, movies, and TV shows, too. “People are more aware of it than they know,” says Mills.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	The Great 78 Project lawsuit includes 39 Mills Brothers recordings — including collaborations with Armstrong and Fitzgerald, and hits of their own, like “Nevertheless (I’m in Love With You)” and “You Always Hurt the One You Love” — all owned by Universal Music.

	</p>




<figure><div>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="You Always Hurt The One You Love" width="500" height="375" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zGLMAvdoeL0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
</div></figure>



<p>
	Mills, like other estate reps I spoke to, stands firmly with the labels. “It is a treasure trove, in essence,” Mills acknowledges of the Great 78 Project. “But they failed to ask the artists, creators, publishers, writers, master rights holders for permission to distribute our work for free.”</p>



<p>
	The estates’ frustrations speak to a tension that’s long confounded Turkewitz, the former RIAA executive, about the Internet Archive’s activities. “How can you take an action that’s so antithetical to the interests of the creator, while claiming a love of the product of the creator?”</p>



<p>
	But the same could arguably be said of record labels. Fundamentally, copyright exists to protect creators and incentivize them to create; but in America, as Litman notes, it’s easy to sign away those rights and much harder to reclaim them. That allows “publishers and other intermediaries to step in, often to the disadvantage of the original author,” Litman adds. This is how the record industry has functioned since forever.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	Doug Holloway, a representative for the Thelonious Monk estate, is unequivocal in his support for the labels’ lawsuit precisely because Monk, like so many Black artists of his era, was gravely underpaid for his work when he was alive. “Thelonious Monk was ripped off,” Holloway says. “Let me be frank about it. Anything that reduces the income to the estate is wrong. Period.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	In their lawsuit, the labels point out that neither they “nor their artists see a dime” from the Internet Archive’s alleged infringement. But for many, this artist-friendly flourish rings hollow as the music industry rakes in obscene amounts of money and the vast majority of artists, or their estates, see very little of it. Halperin calls it a “bad faith” argument that “takes the mantle of creators’ rights and perverts it in order to persecute a nonprofit digital library.”</p>



<p>
	The labels, Litman also notes, still own most of these older recordings outright and are able to keep profiting off their original exploitation with the backing of federal law. Starting in the Seventies, artists were granted a termination of transfer right that allowed them to eventually reclaim their copyrights; the Music Modernization Act did not extend that same right to legacy artists (or their estates) when pre-1972 recordings were finally granted federal copyright protection.

<p>
	“This country owes the recording artists of the mid-20th century not only an apology, but a ton of money,” Litman says. “I don’t see the Great 78 Project taking any of that money out of any performer’s pocket.”</p>



<p>
	For someone like Mills, these contradictions are deeply personal. “These guys worked,” he says of the Mills Brothers. “They fulfilled every job they were asked to do, and they were so good.… For me, it’s all about getting a return on sweat equity.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	But Mills also recognizes that those returns have been stymied by forces far greater than the Internet Archive. He’s part of ongoing litigation against Universal accusing the label of withholding royalties for legacy artists and their estates. (Universal has denied the claims and settled with some of the plaintiffs.) He’s also keenly aware that, as Black artists, the Mills Brothers were not afforded the same financial and investment opportunities as their white counterparts. In the 1930s, Mills says, his dad moved out to Los Angeles to make movies and was unable to buy a house in the affluent, all-white Hancock Park neighborhood, even though he probably could have afforded three.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	I remember what Lew Tucker told me about his father’s one big radio hit: “I think that paid for our house.”</p>



<p>
	Mills talks with passion and reverence about his family, but it’s tangled up in years of frustration. Universal still owns much of the Mills Brothers’ catalog, leaving the estate beholden to the label, whether it’s working on their behalf in the case of the Great 78 Project lawsuit, or against them in the allegations of withheld royalties.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	“My parents, uncles, [and] grandfather probably put thousands of record company executives’ children through college while they were hoping to take care of their own,” Mills says.&nbsp;

	</p>




<p>
	And with years of frustration comes years of pain. There are so many things Mills would rather focus on — the Mills Brothers’ upcoming centennial (they formed in 1925), the concerts he continues to perform under the family banner, and his own new band, <a href="https://orchidsinzoom.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Orchids in Zoom</a>. “It’s like pulling scabs all the time,” he says. “And I don’t want to hurt like that.”&nbsp;</p>



	<h2>
		<strong> “Why Are They Trying to Erase Us?”</strong>	</h2>



<p>
	In Kahle’s office, as our conversation and afternoon together draw to a close, I read to him something from a book he recommended to me called <em>The Library: A Fragile History.</em> Its prologue states, “Even if libraries are cherished, the contents of these collections require constant curation, and often painful decisions about what has continuing value and what must be disposed of.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	How has the Internet Archive — with its ever-growing collection — contended with this question? Ever the evangelist, Kahle replies that technology has made it moot.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	“We’ve been able to build a library not only of famous people, but little people,” he says. “That’s what’s going to be destroyed by these corporations — the history of much more common people. It’s obvious they’re not doing any harm! Why are they doing this?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	Kahle often returns to this question of <em>why?</em> — searching for an answer that’ll explain the potential destruction of not only a digital trove of 78 rpm recordings, but everything else the Archive has preserved, its very mission: universal access to all knowledge. “Without us, people wouldn’t have a record,” Kahle says. “So why are they trying to erase us?”</p>



<p>
	The answer to his <em>why? </em>is evident in the actions of those aligned against him: long-frustrated rights holders and corporations who see little difference between the Internet Archive and illegal torrent sites like the Pirate Bay, and haven’t spent millions lobbying for a copyright system that favors their interests over the public domain for nothing.</p>



<p>
	“You would hope that there might be some balancing act, or that everybody could play nice in the sandbox, and come up with solutions that benefit all,” Kinney, the lawyer and copyright expert, says. Shen then adds with a perceptive laugh: “But that’s not really how business is done.”

	And really, it’s business all the way down. For instance, both Turkewitz and Halperin independently suggest these lawsuits could be laying the groundwork for a more pressing copyright fight against artificial-intelligence companies using licensed work without permission to train large-language models for artificial intelligence.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	“A part of litigation is about establishing precedent and letting the universe understand that you can’t go out and create an undertaking that relies on our product without coming to us to negotiate,” says Turkewitz.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	But even if the labels prevail in protecting their products from the Internet Archive, there’s no guarantee that the actual creators (or their estates) will see any benefits. The labels don’t automatically get $621 million if they win, and how damages shake out is an open question. Sam Trust, a music-publishing vet who oversees the Doris Day estate, supports the suit, but calls the potential damages “absolutely absurd,” adding, “I would be surprised if it’s $41,000 worth of damages.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	And then there’s recent precedent: When the book publishers announced their summary judgment settlement with the Internet Archive last year, the Association of American Publishers said only that the “confidential” damages were enough to cover “significant attorney fees and costs.” No mention was made of how much money — if <em>any</em> — authors would see. (When asked if authors would see any of the settlement following the publishers’ victory on appeal, a rep for the AAP simply said, “The terms of the monetary payment are confidential.”)</p>



<p>
	Maybe, if the labels walk away with a fat check, they’ll do more than pay lawyers, pad bonuses, or boost shareholder value. Maybe they’ll set up a fund that goes directly to all the legacy artists and estates mentioned in the suit — effectively letting a nonprofit pay back the musicians and families those same labels have been accused of exploiting for decades.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	The day Kahle shows me around the Internet Archive’s offices, the existential threat of all this litigation looms heavy, but his enthusiasm remains irrepressible. He’s still optimistic about the internet and the technology behind it, just “not the controlling entities leveraging the internet and the rise of what those monopolies have done to keep people ignorant.”

	</p>




<p>
	At the Internet Archive, Kahle and others are still trying to build the future he always envisioned. He excitedly introduces me to a group of people in the basement working on decentralized web projects — a new open-internet dream of a web that runs on direct connections between individuals, not moderated through dominant, centralized platforms. “This place is kind of the soul of the internet,” says one team member.</p>



<p>
	In the lobby, in the cheesy afterglow of “Concerto Boogie,” Kahle begins to muse: “One of the things about 78s that’s really wonderful, is this is the first time people <em>heard</em> themselves.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	There’s still plenty of awe in his voice, and it sticks as he picks from a small stack a postcard flyer for the Great 78 Project encouraging people to donate discs and join this new endeavor to preserve the past.&nbsp;

<p>
	“The Great 78 Project was a community project; it is a very crowd-sourced, internet-style thing,” Kahle says. “It’s not the Internet Archive — it’s hundreds of collectors and institutions, all working together.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	And then we’re off again, whisked into another room in this cathedral, where a small team is inventing a new way to digitize microfiche.</p>

<p id="speakable-summary">Durk Kingma, one of the lesser-known co-founders of OpenAI, today <a rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/dpkingma/status/1841134573595312344">announced</a> that he’ll be joining Anthropic.</p>

<p>In a series of posts on X, Kingma revealed that he’ll be working mostly remotely, from the Netherlands (where he’s based), but didn’t say which Anthropic org he’ll be joining — or leading. </p>

	
	


<p>Reached for comment, an Anthropic spokesperson pointed to Kingma’s posts.</p>

<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I'll be working (mostly) from the Netherlands, but will visit the SF bay area as frequently as I can!</p>— Durk Kingma (@dpkingma) <a rel="nofollow" href="https://twitter.com/dpkingma/status/1841150126544601448?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 1, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>

<p>“Anthropic’s approach to AI development resonates significantly with my own beliefs,” Kingma wrote. “[L]ooking forward to contributing to Anthropic’s mission of developing powerful AI systems responsibly. Can’t wait to work with their talented team, including a number of great ex-colleagues from OpenAI and Google, and tackle the challenges ahead!”</p>

<p>Kingma, who has a Ph.D. in machine learning from the University of Amsterdam, spent several years as a doctoral fellow at Google before joining OpenAI’s founding team as a research scientist. At OpenAI, Kingma focused on basic research, leading the algorithms team to develop techniques and methods primarily for generative AI models, including image generators (e.g. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/20/openai-unveils-dall-e-3-allows-artists-to-opt-out-of-training/">DALL-E 3</a>) and large language models (e.g. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/chatgpt/">ChatGPT</a>).</p>

<p>In 2018, Kingma left to become a part-time angel investor and advisor for AI startups. He rejoined Google in July of that year, and started at Google Brain, which became one of the tech giant’s premiere AI R&amp;D labs before it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/20/google-consolidates-ai-research-divisions-into-google-deepmind/">merged with DeepMind</a> in 2023.</p>

<p>Kingma’s hiring is yet another talent coup for Anthropic, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/28/anthropic-hires-former-openai-safety-lead-to-head-up-new-team/">recruited</a> OpenAI’s former safety lead, Jan Leike, in May, and another OpenAI co-founder, John Schulman, in August. The company made an additional splashy hire in May, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/15/anthropic-hires-instagram-co-founder-as-head-of-product/">appointing</a> Instagram and Artifact co-founder Mike Krieger as its first head of product.</p>

	
	



<p>Anthropic’s CEO, Dario Amodei, was once the VP of research at OpenAI, and reportedly split with the firm after a disagreement over OpenAI’s roadmap — namely its growing commercial focus. Amodei brought with him a number of ex-OpenAI employees to launch Anthropic, including OpenAI’s former policy lead Jack Clark.</p>

	
	


<p>Anthropic has often attempted to position itself as more safety-focused than OpenAI.<a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2024%2F05%2F28%2Fanthropic-hires-former-openai-safety-lead-to-head-up-new-team%2F&amp;text=Anthropic+hires+former+OpenAI+safety+lead+to+head+up+new+team&amp;via=techcrunch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"></a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2024%2F05%2F28%2Fanthropic-hires-former-openai-safety-lead-to-head-up-new-team%2F" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"></a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2024%2F05%2F28%2Fanthropic-hires-former-openai-safety-lead-to-head-up-new-team%2F&amp;title=Anthropic+hires+former+OpenAI+safety+lead+to+head+up+new+team&amp;summary=Jan+Leike%2C+a+leading+AI+researcher+who+earlier+this+month+resigned+from+OpenAI+before+publicly+criticizing+the+company%E2%80%99s+approach+to+AI+safety%2C+has+joined+OpenAI+rival+Anthropic+to+lead+a+new+%E2%80%9Csuperalignment%E2%80%9D+team.+In+a+post+on+X%2C+Leike+said+that+his+team+at+Anthropic+will+focus+on+various+aspects+of+AI+safety+and+security%2C+%5B%E2%80%A6%5D&amp;mini=1&amp;source=TechCrunch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"></a><a href="https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2024%2F05%2F28%2Fanthropic-hires-former-openai-safety-lead-to-head-up-new-team%2F&amp;title=Anthropic+hires+former+OpenAI+safety+lead+to+head+up+new+team" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"></a><a href="mailto:?subject=Anthropic+hires+former+OpenAI+safety+lead+to+head+up+new+team&amp;body=Article%3A+https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2024%2F05%2F28%2Fanthropic-hires-former-openai-safety-lead-to-head-up-new-team%2F" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"></a><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/28/anthropic-hires-former-openai-safety-lead-to-head-up-new-team/"></a></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>I’m at <a href="https://openai.com/devday/">OpenAI DevDay</a> in San Francisco, and I’m trying something new: a live blog, where this entry will be updated with new notes during the event.</p><div id="live-updates">

<p><strong>10:19</strong> The <strong>keynote</strong> is starting with a review of o1, and some examples of applications that use it.</p>

<p><strong>10:30</strong> They started with some demos of o1 being used in applications, and announced that the rate limit for o1 doubled to 10000 RPM (from 5000 RPM) - same as GPT-4 now.</p>

<p><strong>10:31</strong> The first big announcement: a realtime API, providing the ability to use WebSockets to implement voice input and output against their models.</p>

<p><strong>10:33</strong> What can you build with the new realtime API? The demonstrated an updated version of their Wanderlust travel agent demo. The demo uses voice as both input and output.</p>

</div>

<p><strong>10:39</strong> ... and a demo of an AI assistant making a phone call to order food (thankfully to an OpenAI staff member on stage, not to an actual business!)</p>

<p><strong>10:41</strong> And a demo of the <a href="https://www.speak.com/">Speak</a> language learning app using the new Realtime API. The API is rolling out generally today.</p>

<p><strong>10:41</strong> Next up: model customization. They have fine-tuning for GPT-4o and 4o-mini now. Today they're announcing fine-tuning support for their vision models.</p>

<p><strong>10:42</strong> Now you can use images to fine-tune the model. They suggest this can be used for product recommendations, medical imaging, or even things like traffic sign detection or lane detection (Grab have been using it for that).</p>

<p><strong>10:42</strong> Fine-tuning with vision is available to every developer for GPT-4 (presumably they mean GPT-4o? Not clear.)</p>

<p><strong>10:43</strong> Next: price drops. Cost-per-token is already 99% cheaper than two years ago.</p>

<p><strong>10:44</strong> And today they're adding prompt caching - as seen previously in <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/prompt-caching">Claude</a> and <a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/caching">Gemini</a>.</p>

<p><strong>10:44</strong> Their version of prompt caching is automatic! A 50% discount on tokens the model has seen before.</p>

<p><strong>10:45</strong> Model distillation: where a smaller model is taught by a larger model. Today they're announcing tools for model distillation - so you can fine-tune a 4o-mini model based on output from the larger models.</p>

<p><strong>10:46</strong> Two new tools: stored completions, which lets you store your interactions with the models permanently in the OpenAI platform, to use for fine-tuning and model distillation. That tool ships to all developers today.</p>

<p><strong>10:46</strong> Plus new evaluation tools, also shipping today.</p>

<p><strong>10:47</strong> Sam Altman will be here for the fireside chat in the afternoon, but won't be presenting keynotes before then.</p>

<p><strong>10:51</strong> And now a break. The schedule for the rest of the event has been updated - previously it said "to be announced during the keynote", now we are seeing that 11-11:45am is "Structured Outputs for reliable applications" and 12-12:45pm is "Powerful small models with distillation.</p>

<p><strong>10:52</strong> Then at 2-2:45pm "Multimodel apps with the realtime API.</p>

<p><strong>11:05</strong> Next up: <strong>Structured outputs for reliable applications</strong>. I've done a bunch of work with the OpenAI tools mechanism in the past for this, most notably my <a href="https://www.datasette.cloud/blog/2024/datasette-extract/">datasette-extract plugin</a> for loading unstructured text and images into structured SQLite database tables.</p>

<p><strong>11:06</strong> Atty Eleti and Michelle Pokrass are talking about <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs">structured outputs</a>, the most recent evolution of that mechanism.</p>

<p><strong>11:07</strong> Atty starts with a review of GPT-4 apps like Duolingo, Klarna and Cursor, which "connect to the outside world" - and hence need structured outputs, typically using JSON.</p>

<p><strong>11:08</strong> Classic example of how asking for JSON in the past has often been unreliable - resulting in responses that start "Here is the JSON you asked for...". Developers end up begging for "Just the JSON please!".</p>

<p><strong>11:09</strong> Function calling launched in June 2023, and which helped a bit. In November - last year's DevDay - they released JSON mode that ensured valid data - but this could still hallucinate parameters or output the wrong type.</p>

<p><strong>11:10</strong> Structured Outputs, released in August this year, ensures that the output will exactly match a specified JSON schema. Michelle will explain how this works under the hood. The challenge was making sure the solution was performant for inference at scale.</p>

<p><strong>11:12</strong> Function calling continues to work the same way: you provide a tool with a type of function, then describe that function's parameters using JSON schema. Add <code>"strict": true</code> to that JSON to turn on the new structured output mode for those functions.</p>

<p><strong>11:14</strong> And now a demo, with a function that describes data tables, their columns and operations that can be executed against them. Adding <code>"strict": true</code> fixed a bug where the model used an operator that wasn't defined in the set of operators.</p>

<p><strong>11:15</strong> <code>"response_format": {"type": "json_schema"}</code> enables specifying a full JSON schema that's guaranteed to be followed by the structured outputs mode.</p>

<p><strong>11:17</strong> The demo imagines AI-enhanced glasses, using a neat <code>{"voice_over": "This is what the glasses say to you", "display": "4 feet tall"}</code> output format which updates a display with a short string and specifies a longer string to be spoken out loud.</p>

<p><strong>11:18</strong> Next demo imagines a resume reviewing application, where you can drop a PDF resume directly onto a web form which then uses structured outputs to pull out the fields needed by the resume application.</p>

<p><strong>11:20</strong> The OpenAI library for JavaScript supports <a href="https://zod.dev/">Zod</a> for defining these schemas, and the Python library supports <a href="https://docs.pydantic.dev/">Pydantic</a>.</p>

<p><strong>11:21</strong> I'm presuming that previous demo converted the PDF to images automatically - I don't think any of the OpenAI APIs accept PDF directly.</p>

<p><strong>11:23</strong> This next demo is much more interesting: defining a schema for a full dashboard interface, where different cards can represent charts or tables or rows - so now the tool can output a custom answer to a question with embedded charts and data. Hopefully the code will be published on GitHub after the talk.</p>

<p><strong>11:24</strong> Overall this is a pretty sophisticated demo of a custom chat UI with a whole assortment of custom tools built on top of function calling and structured output.</p>

<p><strong>11:25</strong> Atty emphasizes that prior to structured outputs reliability was a really big problem - any of these steps failing could break the entire application.</p>

<p><strong>11:25</strong> Next, Michelle is talking about the underlying implementation of structured outputs.</p>

<p><strong>11:26</strong> "We took an approach that combined both research and engineering". It's more than just prompting - they used a technique called "constrained decoding". (Sounds to me like the <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/llms/llama-cpp-python-grammars">Llama.cpp grammars trick</a>).</p>

<p><strong>11:27</strong> As an example, consider handwritten number recognition - where there are only ten possible output labels, from 0 to 9. This is a classic machine learning image recognition task.</p>



<p><strong>11:30</strong> For structured outputs, the trick is to limit which tokens can be produced next. The technique used here is called "token masking". The LLM still generates probabilities for likely next tokens, but they then mask out any tokens that would not match the desired schema.</p>

<p><strong>11:31</strong> These masks have to be updated on every single inference step, so the operation has to be lightning fast to keep inference as fast as possible. Token sampling happens on a GPU in batches - which means the CPU can calculate the masks for the next step in parallel while the GPU is calculating probabilities.</p>

<p><strong>11:32</strong> These masks need to be calculated within 10ms. "We wanted to pre-compute as much work as possible" - to make mask computation more of a lookup. They build an index, derived from the JSON schema, to make fetching those masks as fast as possible.</p>

<p><strong>11:33</strong> JSON Schema is converted into a grammar, then a parser, then they iterate over ALL tokens and parse states and use that to create the index.</p>

<p><strong>11:33</strong> The indexs is a trie - a prefix-based data structure allowing for O1 lookups.</p>

<p><strong>11:34</strong> Generating the index is computationally expensive due to the need to go over all of the possible states. They do that just once and cache the index - which is why the first query to structured inputs can take a little time - sometimes up to 10 seconds - but following prompts are fast.</p>

<p><strong>11:35</strong> The open source community has used tricks to implement masks by turning a schema into a regular expression. But regular expressions don't cover recursive or deeply nested schemas - so they can't cover all of the features of JSON Schema.</p>

<p><strong>11:35</strong> Generative UI is a good example of a use-case that needs nested schemas - each component can have a list of children that might include more components. These cannot be converted to a regular expression due to that limit in terms of recursive nesting.</p>

<p><strong>11:37</strong> OpenAI wanted recursive JSON schema support, so they added a stack. They call this the CFG - Context Free Grammar - approach, which combines regular expressions and a stack. This is why it takes a little bit of time to build up the trie for inference.</p>

<p><strong>11:38</strong> So the trade-off here is the short delay when the schema is first encountered, which OpenAI think is worthwhile for the improved reliability.</p>

<p><strong>11:38</strong> Atty is now talking about the research side: how can we get the model to follow the schema in the most useful way possible?</p>

<p><strong>11:39</strong> If you force a model to output JSON fitting the grammar, you might end up with <code>{\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</code> until it hits the maximum of tokens.</p>

<p><strong>11:40</strong> OpenAI's internal evals showed that gpt-4o-2024-08-06 with Structured Outputs was far more accurate than prompting alone against the older models. They now get to 100% on that eval (not sure what that's measuring though).</p>

<p><strong>11:42</strong> One of the controversial API design decisions made was around <code>additionalProperties: true</code> - which is usually a default in JSON Schema. OpenAI have disallowed additional properties by default in their API, which differs from developer expectations.</p>

<p><strong>11:42</strong> OpenAI say explicit is better, so developers have to pass <code>additionalProperties: false</code> in their schemas.</p>

<p><strong>11:43</strong> All properties are required by default - no support for optional parameters (although they can be made nullable). Developers need to follow this rule in the JSON Schemas they send over as well.</p>

<p><strong>11:43</strong> Fields are generated in the same order that you defined them in the schema, even though JSON is supposed to ignore key order. This ensures you can implement things like chain-of-thought by adding those keys in the correct order in your schema design.</p>



<p><strong>11:46</strong> This session didn't present any new features - they were all in the documentation already - but the insight into how the Structured Output works under the hood was new.</p>

<p><strong>12:01</strong> Next up: <strong>Powerful small models with distillation</strong>, with John Allard and Steven Heidel.</p>

<p><strong>12:02</strong> Distillation "allows you to create powerful, small models". They'll talk about why it matters, how it works and best practices and use cases - plus demos of the two new API platform features they are launching today.</p>

<p><strong>12:02</strong> Once you get an AI app working, the next step is figuring out how to get it to work at scale. You care about uptime, rate limits, latency and cost.</p>

<p><strong>12:04</strong> GPT-4o is 15x more expensive than GPT-4o mini, but it brings a large amount of additional "knowledge" - graduate level physics etc. It excels at the toughest knowledge benchmarks. Do you need that type of intelligence for your application?</p>

<p><strong>12:06</strong> Distillation: you fine-tune the small output on the outputs of the large model. You're compressing some of the capabilities of the large model into that smaller model.</p>

<p><strong>12:07</strong> Distillation involves three steps. The first and most important is to build task-specific evals for your application. You can't skip this step, because you can't improve what you can't measure.</p>

<p><strong>12:07</strong> The second step is to capture examples of what good performance looks like. Store example completions from a large model like GPT-4o and create a dataset.</p>

<p><strong>12:08</strong> The final step is the fine-tuning. Teach the small model how to replicate the responses from the large model by showing it many of those captured examples. We're trying to "compress the intelligence" of the large model into that small model.</p>

<p><strong>12:09</strong> A lot of people have done distillation on the OpenAI platform before, using the existing <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning">fine-tuning mechanism</a>. Doing it that way is a lot of work though.</p>

<p><strong>12:10</strong> The two new features they are launching today will make distillation easier. The first is stored completions: a new parameter to the chat completions API that will let you opt-in to storing the full input and output to the model. You can apply tags as well, to help filter those later to create datasets for fine-tuning. <code>{"store:" true}</code></p>

<p><strong>12:11</strong> The second feature is a beta of an Evals product. This should allow you to do distillation end-to-end on the OpenAI platform.</p>

<p><strong>12:11</strong> Real-world use-case based on the Superhuman email app. That app has a "quick reply" feature that suggests options for a reply based on reading through the existing thread. How would you scale that feature to hundreds of millions of emails?</p>



<p><strong>12:14</strong> Using the Python client library for <code>client.chat.completions.create()</code> you can add <code>store=True, metadata={"tag": "test-set"}</code> to store a prompt/response and add it to a tag.</p>



<p><strong>12:15</strong> Then in the new <a href="https://platform.openai.com/evalutions/create">/evalutions/create</a> interface you can add testing criteria and use that to create a new evaluation. (I don't have access to that page yet.)</p>

<p><strong>12:17</strong> Having created an eval it's easy to run that against other models - try it against GPT-4o mini and compare that with GPT-4o for example.</p>

<div data-update-id="76">
  <p><strong>12:20</strong> </p><p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/eval.jpg" alt="Screenshot of a web interface showing evaluation results for an AI model named 'quick-reply-2-4o'. The interface displays a table with columns for messages, output, and three evaluation metrics: 'repliesToRightPerson', 'repliesToMostPressingIssue', and 'repliesMakeSense'. The table shows 8 rows of data, each representing a different conversation. Overall metrics at the top indicate 95%, 91%, and 97% success rates for the three evaluation criteria respectively. The interface appears to be part of a platform called 'Distillation Test' in a 'DevDay Demo' project."></p>
</div>

<p><strong>12:21</strong> ... and now a demonstration of the fine-tuning UI, showing how a fine-tuned GPT-4o mini model on that data performs much better than 4o-mini on its own.</p>

<p><strong>12:23</strong> Is distillation right for your use-cases? That comes down to task generality against required precision. Great use-cases for distillation are tasks that cover a relatively narrow domain and have a relatively low precision requirement - a great fit for small models.</p>

<p><strong>12:23</strong> Tasks that have high precision needs but narrow generality work well too - that's a lot of forms of categorization. You may need a larger and more diverse data set to get that to work well. Same for broad generality and low precision.</p>

<p><strong>12:24</strong> Tasks with a broad generality and high need for precision are a poor fit for distillation - they need a full-powered large model.</p>

<p><strong>12:25</strong> Things to watch out for: Unevenly distributed or biased data points. Your training data should match the patterns of your production data. Also sparse examples which may result in blind spots in your data. A great example is fraud - if it's rare you might find that 1,000 samples have no instances of fraud at all!</p>

<p><strong>12:26</strong> Part of the value of distillation is you don't necessarily need human generated data or responses - but that doesn't mean you don't need to actively curate your distillation dataset. "We tend to see distillation work best with the order of thousands rather than millions of examples."</p>

<p><strong>12:27</strong> Finally, take an iterative approach. Fine-tuning might not work on your first try - there are many variables to consider. It's important to start small with a few hundred examples and scale up once you know it's working based on your evals. Don't jump straight to millions of data points.</p>

<p><strong>12:28</strong> It strikes me that fine-tuning and distillation are strategically a great way of keeping people locked to one platform - if you build an application purely on top of prompt engineering it's much easier to swap between different LLM vendors than if you have fine-tuned a model.</p>

<p><strong>12:29</strong> They expect that it will become common for applications to be built using a collection of many different distilled small models, with a few large models for tasks that don't work well for distillation.</p>

<p><strong>12:30</strong> ... and now lunch - sessions resume at 2pm.</p>

<p><strong>12:32</strong> The system I built for this live blog is very simple - just <code>fetch()</code> calls polling an endpoint and updating a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> using <code>innerHTML</code> - but the endpoint itself sets a 10s cache so Cloudflare should only let a hit through to the underlying app every 10s no matter how many people are viewing the page.</p>

<div><p>Tanner Green is concerned about the tiny aluminum plugs left behind when you cut 30 holes in the seat rail of a wheelchair. The cutting is done by an enormous robotic laser controlled by a computer model. A tech feeds a 20-foot aluminum tube into the machine, makes a few clicks on the computer, and the machine gets to work, cutting the tube to length, 30 holes for the axle adjustment, two channels for clamping in the footplate tubes and two etchings to help line up the tube on the bending machine. Running at full speed, the cutting takes just a couple of minutes.</p><p>It’s mesmerizing to watch. When the laser is done cutting, sometimes the leftover material just falls out, but sometimes it stays in place. “Then, you have to grab a screwdriver or some other tool and get them out yourself,” Green says as he starts whacking and prodding at the just-cut seat rail. Some plugs come out immediately, some are more stubborn. In all, it takes as long to get all the plugs out as it took for the laser to make the cuts.</p><p>For Green, the chief engineer at <a href="https://notawheelchair.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Not a Wheelchair</a>, this is one of the thousand complications standing between his team and a rather lofty goal: upending the manual wheelchair marketplace. If you’ve heard of Not a Wheelchair, it’s likely because of its owners, Zack Nelson, the star of the 8.8-million-subscriber YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@JerryRigEverything" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">JerryRigEverything</a>, and his wife Cambry, a para and manual wheelchair user. The Nelsons got into the mobility equipment business a few years ago when they released The Rig, an electric, adaptive off-road device with a simple yet robust and functional design priced significantly lower than anything else on the market. Now, they’re bringing that same ethos to manual wheelchairs.</p><p>Not a Wheelchair aims to offer a base-model, custom manual wheelchair at a similar or better quality than most of the insurance-approved wheelchairs in the U.S. for $999. Yes, that’s just under $1,000 for everything — wheels, handrims, tires, side guards and rigid, angle-adjustable backrest included. And the company plans to have a turnaround time of weeks, rather than the monthslong slog that it typically takes from order to delivery.</p><p>When I first heard about this, it sounded awesome and a bit far-fetched. It’s hard to find a pair of quality wheelchair wheels for less than $500. Same with a rigid backrest. How were they going to offer both, plus a custom wheelchair frame without compromising on quality? I drove to their headquarters in Utah to find out.</p></div>

<h2>Inside the Paradox</h2>



<div><p>When you turn into the neighborhood where Not a Wheelchair’s manufacturing facility is, you’re greeted by about a dozen cows chewing grass in a smallish, triangular field. There’s a busy road to one side and brand new, multistory apartment complexes on the other two sides. There’s no indication of how the cows got there — as if a city suddenly sprung up around them. Past the cows and the apartments are rows of warehouses. Then you turn the corner and the buildings go from huge to enormous. Not a Wheelchair is housed in one of the largest buildings I’ve ever seen.</p><p>I roll inside and am greeted by Nelson and Green. Nelson looks familiar because he’s exactly as he appears on YouTube — tall, muscular and shiny bald, with a soft, measured voice. The office space is still spartan — just a row of computers and a kitchen. “None of this was here even a few weeks ago,” Green says. “We took over an empty building about five weeks ago, and it’s been non-stop ever since.”</p></div>



<div><p>The Not a Wheelchair name started to differentiate The Rig — an electric offroad vehicle capable of going places that a wheelchair could not. Nelson is famous for building and modifying all sorts of things — from converting a Humvee to electric power to digging an enormous bunker in the couple’s backyard, but Not a Wheelchair has quickly taken on an identity of its own. “We’ve always seen ourselves as an outdoor mobility company,” says Nelson. “We want to make it easier for people to move around outside and in their communities.” Now though, Nelson finds himself about to release a manual wheelchair under the Not a Wheelchair name. “We started calling it The Paradox Project,” he says. “But if you have a better idea for a name, we’re open to suggestions.”</p><p>When I roll out to the manufacturing floor, there are huge machines scattered across the 26,000-square-foot space. There’s an apartment-sized laser cutter that looks like it should be stationed on a spaceship, a computer-controlled tubing bender, a welding station, powder coating and curing cabinets, an assembly area and a half dozen other prototyping and testing machines scattered along the perimeter. The machines are set up as a series of production pods that snake in a sequential line from start (cutting tubes) to the end (assembly) of the wheelchair-making process.</p></div>

<div><p>“The culture I grew up in in terms of my career was very much around process improvement,” says Green, who’s worked with semi-conductors at Intel, missiles at Raytheon and medical devices at a smaller consulting firm. He first connected with Nelson after watching a YouTube video about The Rig and thinking it was a cool project. He cold-emailed Nelson, volunteering his engineering services for anything Nelson needed help with. Just a year or so later, Nelson convinced Green to move to Utah and work full time with Not a Wheelchair. Green has been working on the manual wheelchair project for almost two years and for him, having a good design is only the first stage in the process. Turning that design into a quality product, quickly, inexpensively and consistently takes a dozen interdependent steps.</p><p>The first step in the manufacturing process is to cut the frame tubing, and you can’t move to the next step without removing those annoying aluminum plugs. Green says they’ve been messing with the settings on the cutter to get more of the plugs to release on their own. It might only save a minute per chair — but when you’re trying to change the wheelchair industry, every minute counts.</p><p>At the next stage of the process — bending — Nelson is watching the process as a tech slowly puts the machine through its process at about 10% of its capability. “Are we running at 100%? Why is this so slow?” Nelson asks. “Come on, let’s get it moving. We can go faster than this.”</p><p>Speed is part of the culture at Not a Wheelchair. “The whole goal is to get from idea to drawing to actual physical product that we can test as fast as possible,” Nelson says. With their current setup, the team can build an entire chair in a few hours, and that time is coming down quickly as the company’s 15 employees get more comfortable with the process.</p><p>Everybody I talked to was on the same page. Why go fast? Because it matters how long it takes for someone to get a new wheelchair. “The time it takes means that somebody is being impacted by not being able to get that chair sooner,” says Green. “If they’re waiting six, eight, 12 months for a chair, that’s six, eight, 12 months that they’re going without. They’re having to make do with what they have, whether it’s something that doesn’t fit them, it’s broken, or some other issue. I don’t want to make anybody wait that long for something that’s an important part of their life.”</p></div>

<h2>YouTube $</h2>



<div><p>If you’re looking at the reasons that Not a Wheelchair is able to make a $1,000 wheelchair, hyper-efficient manufacturing techniques and state-of-the-art equipment are near the top of the list. But factories and enormous fancy machines cost a lot of money, and in any normal business model, those costs are passed on to the consumer. But what if the owners aren’t dependent on — or even interested in — making money from the business? Meet Zack and Cambry, YouTube stars.</p><p>Nelson started his YouTube channel 12 years ago. He was in college and had no career path. He just knew he wanted to be his own boss. He had a jeep with a busted gear inside the transfer case. “Instead of taking it to the shop and fixing it for $1,000, I followed this YouTube video and fixed it for like 60 bucks instead,” he says. “So I emailed the guy who made the video and I was like, ‘Why did you make this video for people? It’s such a nice thing to do.’ He said, ‘To decrease world suck, to make the world a better place, and also I make money for the ads that appear when the videos are playing.’ That was an epiphany for me, like, ‘Oh, I could be my own boss. I could do the projects that I’m already doing anyway, film them and make money on the internet.’ That satisfied every little box I was looking for in a career.”</p><p>Nelson started with videos of himself repairing his jeep and quickly moved onto durability and repair videos for smart phones, which turned into the bread and butter of his growing YouTube presence. Nelson didn’t have any knowledge of mobility products, or any personal experience with disability, until he met Cambry.</p></div>

<div><p>Cambry is slight and blond. She got hurt doing equestrian vaulting — basically gymnastics on horseback and yes, it’s as wild as it sounds. Zack and Cambry met via an online dating app and Cambry was upfront about her disability. “Before our first date, Zack asked me if there was anything he needed to do to pick me up,” Cambry says. “I really wanted to make up a big story about how he would have to go to DMV to get a special license to be able to take me anywhere, but I chickened out and told him, ‘You know, usually I just meet someone at a restaurant.’”</p><p>Like all wheelchair users on a first date, Cambry was worried Zack was going to be weird about her disability. “But his first disability-related question was to ask if I’d done any cool upgrades to my wheelchair.” She had not. But this was someone she could hang out with.</p><p>Not long after they started dating, Nelson surprised her with a DIY off-road wheelchair — two electric bikes with a welded seat in the middle, “chariot-style” as Nelson puts it in the video where Cambry tries it out for the first time. That video was also Cambry’s first appearance on the YouTube channel. She’s clearly nervous about being on camera and freezes for a second when Zack asks her a question. Once she’s on the bike, she quickly settles in, blasting around grassy fields and almost flipping herself as she climbs a curb at full speed.</p><p>That video has 11 million views and counting. A year later, when Zack and Cambry released a video debuting The Rig, Cambry looks like a pro. Zack and Cambry got married in 2019 and now have two kids. Cambry remains a regular presence on the YouTube channel. She explains the challenges of living with a disability in a straightforward, relatable way and is fun and adventurous when trying out the new gear. It’s a hard needle to thread when you’re living off YouTube views, but Cambry passes the realness test and does a good job of normalizing disability for the channel’s audience, the vast majority of whom aren’t disabled.</p><p>Videos with Cambry and accessibility projects consistently get millions of views. “The internet loves Cambry,” Zack says. “I’ve tested videos where I’ll do two versions of the exact same video, one with a photo of me as the thumbnail and the other with Cambry, and the one with Cambry will get like twice as many views.”</p><p>In the world of YouTube, putting out multimillion-view videos translates to millions in revenue in the form of ads, partnerships and affiliate sales. It’s that income stream that has allowed the Nelsons to fund a wheelchair production factory, along with the staff to go along with it, without incurring massive amounts of debt.</p></div>

<div><p>While I’m rolling around the Not a Wheelchair facility, marveling at the scale of it, I can’t help but wonder why they decided to do it. I mean, it’s one thing to build cool, one-off mobility devices. It’s another thing entirely to self-fund and spend years developing the capacity to mass produce affordable wheelchairs. For Zack and Cambry, it was pretty simple: There is clearly a need. And with Zack’s background and connections, combined with the income from JerryRigEverything, they were in a unique position to do something about it.</p><p>“Jumping through many levels worth of hoops just to get a wheelchair was incredibly frustrating for me,” says Cambry. “I got engaged to Zack in 2019 and wanted to buy a new wheelchair before my wedding, which was six months away at the time, and my new chair almost didn’t even arrive in time for our wedding day. It was stressful knowing that my current wheelchair could break at any time and leave me stranded for weeks or months. I know I’m not the only one who had that stress in the back of my mind. So hopefully, now with our own wheelchair factory, we are able to fix some of those problems.”</p></div>



<h2>The Wheelchair Business</h2>



<p>Not a Wheelchair will sell its manual wheelchairs directly to consumers. That means if you want a wheelchair, you can go to the website, click through to an online configurator and spec out your wheelchair in real time. You enter your measurements, and a 3D model of your chair adjusts to your tweaks. You can see the difference that seat depths, backrest heights and frame angles make on the finished product.</p>



<div><p>Once the company opens to the public, Not a Wheelchair expects to have a custom, manual wheelchair shipped four weeks after you hit the order button. Ramped up to full speed, they hope to have that time down to two weeks. Compared to the typical wheelchair buying process, that is — to borrow a phrase from <em>Space Balls</em> — ludicrous speed. Not a Wheelchair aims to do it not only by automating as much of the process as possible, but also by eliminating the middlemen. That means no seating clinic, no insurance company, no DME supplier. This has pros and cons.</p><p>Let’s start with the seating clinic. The main purpose of the seating clinic or a physical therapist wheelchair evaluation is to provide you with expert advice about what equipment — from wheelchair type to components and wheelchair measurements — is best for your body and for your needs, and to make sure, using pressure mapping, that the equipment you ordered fits you properly and protects you from pressure sores. I’ll let you judge how often that process results in perfectly fitting equipment. Not a Wheelchair is making consumers supply their own measurements. That can be from the chair you’re already sitting in, from a seating clinic or conjured up after comparing specs from your friends at happy hour. That gives you the power to order what you want. But it also means that if the chair doesn’t fit, it’s on you.</p></div>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="748" height="924" src="https://newmobility.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/notawheelchair-redtape-829x1024.jpg" alt="man kneeling next to woman in wheelchair symbolically cutting through red tape over a wheelchair" srcset="https://newmobility.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/notawheelchair-redtape.jpg 748w, https://newmobility.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/notawheelchair-redtape-243x300.jpg 243w, https://newmobility.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/notawheelchair-redtape-768x948.jpg 749w, https://newmobility.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/notawheelchair-redtape-50x62.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 748px) 100vw, 748px"><figcaption>One of the company’s goals is to cut through the red tape associated with buying a wheelchair.</figcaption></figure></div>


<div><p>Next up, insurance companies. They’re supposed to pay for your equipment. But they also require you to use other middlemen, which increases costs. In today’s broken system of U.S. healthcare, most insurance, even private, will pay a bare minimum for manual wheelchairs and components. Copays for that basic equipment often cost more than $1,000. For wheelchair users with specific needs (most of us) who go through the runaround of denials, only to be “approved” and still owe four figures, it can feel like a shell game.</p><p>Lastly, DME suppliers. Two helpful services that DME suppliers are supposed to provide are wheelchair setup and repair. In Not a Wheelchair’s model, you do the adjustment and repair yourself, get a friend or family member to help, or find a local bike shop willing to work on your chair.</p></div>



<div><p>“The whole point of my YouTube channel is durability and repairability. I’ve been preaching that for 12 years, so we’re bringing that into the chair as well. We’re using standard hardware, and we’re consolidating as many of the bolts as possible to as few sizes as possible so that there are fewer tools needed. We want to be able to make it simple enough that people can do the adjustments and the repairs by themselves, and if they need a caster replaced, something binds up or the bearing inside the caster seizes, they can pop the caster off and put a new one on and we’ll sell those replacement parts. Or, if they’re under warranty, we’ll just give them those replacement parts.”</p><p>Nelson says that they’re pitching the chair as a secondary option for wheelchairs users, something to have around for traveling or getting dirty or as a backup chair. For $1,000, that seems reasonable. But for that price and ease of ordering, it’s reasonable to assume that no matter how the chairs are being pitched, a lot of wheelchair users will choose to order one as their primary chair. How the easy order process and results will work at scale is a big unknown. Another big question: How exactly are they going to make a profit charging that little for a wheelchair?</p><p>They’re not. Same as with The Rig and any other products they develop, Zack and Cambry won’t be taking any profit from Not a Wheelchair, and they aren’t taking any salary from the company, which operates separately from the YouTube channel. “It’s a passion project for us,” says Nelson. To be clear, Not a Wheelchair isn’t a nonprofit — it’s currently licensed as a benefit company, a newer designation of a for-profit company that provides a public service. “Once it’s established, it’s going to become an employee-owned company. I want my employees to be extremely well taken care of, but as owners, we have other ways of making money,” says Nelson.</p><p>Second, they’re offering the base model chair at low margins. If you order a chair with no upgrades from Not a Wheelchair, your costs won’t be much more than it costs the company to get it to you. Margins are higher for upgrades — things like a carbon fiber seat pan, wooden handrims and more complicated frame bends. “As people change the options on their wheelchair and get a more premium version, we make more profit on that,” says Nelson. “We’ll happily take money from people who want to upgrade their machines, but we don’t want to take money from people who just need the basics.”</p></div>



<h2>Testing, Testing</h2>



<div><p>So how does Not a Wheelchair’s base model chair stack up to other options on the market? I hate to sound like a preacher, but … it’s totally reasonable! It hits the mark of being at least as good, if not better, than the majority of insurance-approved wheelchairs in the U.S.</p><p>Not a Wheelchair made me a base model chair to try for this article. They didn’t ask me to write good things about it, and they’re not paying for advertising. (The other benefit of having a huge YouTube channel, is you also have a built-in marketing channel with a worldwide reach.) The chair they gave me is basic. I’ve been using it on and off for a couple of weeks since I visited the factory. It rolls straight and smooth. It doesn’t weigh that much more than my fully-fixed, titanium-framed chair. Its backrest is comfortable and angle-adjustable. The rear seat height is adjustable, along with the front caster height and angle, and the center of gravity. It feels solid, not all janky and rattly, like old-school adjustable chairs did.</p></div>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="785" height="924" src="https://newmobility.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Cambry-minature-horses-870x1024.jpg" alt="woman in wheelchair feeding miniature horses" srcset="https://newmobility.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Cambry-minature-horses.jpg 785w, https://newmobility.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Cambry-minature-horses-255x300.jpg 255w, https://newmobility.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Cambry-minature-horses-768x904.jpg 768w, https://newmobility.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Cambry-minature-horses-50x59.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 785px) 100vw, 785px"><figcaption>The Nelsons keep miniature horses on their property, and Cambry wanted a wheelchair that could handle the rigors of an active lifestyle.</figcaption></figure>



<div><p>The wheels, which Not a Wheelchair commissioned from <a href="https://vaporwheels.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vapors Wheels</a>, are great. I liked them so much that I stole them to replace the $900, fiber-spoked wheels that keep going out of true on my titanium chair. I put the old wheels with some fatter tires on the Not a Wheelchair and lowered the rear seat height so I could use it as an off-road chair for pushing around the dirt and grass around my house. I’ll keep pushing <a href="https://newmobility.com/finding-the-right-wheelchair/" data-type="post" data-id="44071" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">my titanium chair </a>for everyday life because I like how titanium rides, and my chair is fitted with ergo seating and other frame customizations that Not a Wheelchair isn’t yet offering.</p><p>But the Not a Wheelchair won’t sit in my garage getting dusty. It’ll be getting dirty in the summer and snowy in the winter. And if my other chair breaks, I know I have a comfy, perfectly acceptable option to use while I’m fixing it. And that’s kind of the point: Wheelchairs shouldn’t be so expensive that you can’t afford to have a backup or one with an alternate seating position for specific activities. Not a Wheelchair might finally be the company with the means and the will to change that.</p><p>Touring the factory, I saw other prototypes scattered all around the facility. There’s a beefier, four-wheel drive version of The Rig that the company just launched. There’s a track wheelchair that’s still in development. It’s clear that Not a Wheelchair doesn’t intend to stop at a simple, manual wheelchair. Inexpensive components, more advanced electric off-road devices, power assist, it’s all on the table. “We’re just really excited to see where this leads,” says Green.</p></div>

    <tr><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td><div><p>Hey it’s Hassaan &amp; Quinn – co-founders of Tavus, an AI research company and developer platform for video APIs. We’ve been building AI video models for ‘digital twins’ or ‘avatars’ since 2020.</p><p>We’re sharing some of the challenges we faced building an AI video interface that has realistic conversations with a human, including getting it to under 1 second of latency.</p><p>To try it, talk to Hassaan’s digital twin: <a href="https://www.hassaanraza.com/" rel="nofollow">https://www.hassaanraza.com</a>, or to our "demo twin" Carter: <a href="https://www.tavus.io/">https://www.tavus.io</a></p><p>We built this because until now, we've had to adapt communication to the limits of technology. But what if we could interact naturally with a computer? Conversational video makes it possible – we think it'll eventually be a key human-computer interface.</p><p>To make conversational video effective, it has to have really low latency and conversational awareness. A fast-paced conversation between friends has ~250 ms between utterances, but if you’re talking about something more complex or with someone new, there is additional “thinking” time. So, less than 1000 ms latency makes the conversation feel pretty realistic, and that became our target.</p><p>Our architecture decisions had to balance 3 things: latency, scale, &amp; cost. Getting all of these was a huge challenge.</p><p>The first lesson learned was to make it low-latency, we had to build it from the ground up. We went from a team that cared about seconds to a team that counts every millisecond. We also had to support thousands of conversations happening all at once, without getting destroyed on compute costs.</p><p>For example, during early development, each conversation had to run on an individual H100 in order to fit all components and model weights into GPU memory just to run our Phoenix-1 model faster than 30fps. This was unscalable &amp; expensive.</p><p>We developed a new model, Phoenix-2, with a number of improvements, including inference speed. We switched from a NeRF based backbone to  Gaussian Splatting for a multitude of reasons, one being the requirement that we could generate frames faster than realtime, at 70+ fps on lower-end hardware. 
We exceeded this and focused on optimizing memory and core usage on GPU to allow for lower-end hardware to run it all. We did other things to save on time and cost like using streaming vs batching, parallelizing processes, etc. But those are stories for another day.</p><p>We still had to lower the utterance-to-utterance time to hit our goal of under a second of latency. This meant each component (vision, ASR, LLM, TTS, video generation) had to be hyper-optimized.</p><p>The worst offender was the LLM. It didn’t matter how fast the tokens per second (t/s) were, it was the time-to-first token (tfft) that really made the difference. That meant services like Groq were actually too slow – they had high t/s, but slow ttft. Most providers were too slow.</p><p>The next worst offender was actually detecting when someone stopped speaking. This is  hard. Basic solutions use time after silence to ‘determine’ when someone has stopped talking. But it adds latency. If you tune it to be too short, the AI agent will talk over you. Too long, and it’ll take a while to respond.

  <p><em>[Note that this article is a transcript of the video embedded above.]</em></p><p>If you have to know the answer right away, it’s no; or at least, my goal with this video is to convince you that the world is not running out of sand. But if it were that simple, I wouldn’t be here (right?) and you probably wouldn’t be either. In fact, I was really surprised by some of the things I didn’t know as I dug deeper into the topic further, and how some of the most widely spread sand “facts” are dead wrong.</p><p>The wide world of sand is complicated, and not in a boring, pedantic kind of way. This simple material touches nearly every part of our lives, and the science and engineering behind it is rich and deep, and to me at least, hard not to become obsessed with. There’s a good chance you’ve seen articles or videos over the past few years with essentially the same story about sand. The “Sand Wars” documentary kind of kicked off the modern discussion, and then Vince Beiser wrote an excellent book on the topic, “The World in a Grain.” Of course, a lot of the book’s best reviews focus on the fact that sand is kind of a topic that’s “taken for granted” or “neglected.” But, at least in civil engineering, it is one of the most glected materials out there. And I’d like to give you a peek behind the curtain and show you how we think about this seemingly unlimited resource and why it’s worth knowing a little more about it. But first, I need to head out to the garage and put some sand in a rock tumbler, because I want to do a material property shootout, and this is going to take a little while. I have something really cool in the other barrel, and I’ll show it to you later on in the video. I’m Grady, and this is Practical Engineering.</p><p>What the heck is sand anyway? It’s kind of a “know it when you see it”-type material. If we use the US Department of Agriculture’s soil textural triangle, sand is any granular material that is at least 85% sand… So, what the heck is sand? For a better answer, we have the Unified Soil Classification System. Geotechnical engineers sometimes say that “dirt” is a four-letter word. Maybe because it undermines the importance of soil (which is also a four-letter word, by the way), but I like to think it’s because we have better names for all the dirts around the world, and here they are. In fact, there are four specific kinds of sand, but they all fit this one criterion, and it’s all about the size of the particles. At least half of those particles have to make it through a Number 4 sieve (about 5 millimeters), but no more than half can go through a Number 200 sieve (less than a tenth of a millimeter, or about 75 microns). That is a pretty wide range of materials, but I think when you picture sand in your mind, you probably imagine what the USCS would call “clean sand” where less than 12% pass the 200 sieve. So, just to make it simple, let’s say that sand is a material where the particles fit through this, but they don’t fit through this. But still, that encompasses a huge range of different dirts. And I hope, at this point, you’re asking, “Who Cares?” because I would love to answer that question.</p><p>In his book, Beiser calls sand “the most important solid substance on earth…the literal foundation of modern civilization…” We use it to make glass, semiconductors, fiber optics, filters, and abrasives, use it to texture surfaces, to play in, for beauty, and more. But, probably more than anything else, sand is an essential ingredient in concrete. And, you know, I’m a civil engineer; this is a channel about the built environment; so I wanna talk about concrete. And, in fact, if this video sparks your curiosity about one of my favorite materials, I have a whole playlist of topics I’ve covered in the past so you can learn more after this. You can’t really overstate how important concrete is and how much of it we use. There’s a bigger conversation to be had about its environmental impacts, but when compared to alternative building materials, it just has so much going for it. It is an extremely low-cost, durable substance that can be made into just about any shape you can imagine. Concrete has enabled us to build structures that last for generations from some very simple ingredients that are (mostly) available across the world: water, cement, gravel, and sand.</p><p>Most of those ingredients are mined and used directly as raw materials. And they’re usually mined close by. Transportation makes up a big part of the cost associated with sands used for construction, so the distance between where they’re found and where they need to go is highly correlated with how economical they can be. And that often leads to environmental impacts, some worse than others, depending on local regulations. It turns out that the best sand for concrete often comes from rivers, and mining in rivers can be particularly destructive because the impacts can spread upstream and downstream through changes in the nature of the channel. (I have a series of videos on that topic, too, by the way). Sand isn’t spread evenly throughout the world, and it’s a non-renewable resource. Geologic processes produce it a lot slower than we can use it. So, it makes some intuitive sense to say that we could eventually run out. But here’s a fact that is often overlooked in the discussion: we can make sand.</p><p>And it’s not that complicated, either. I talked about the definition of sand a little earlier, but here’s another one: it’s just very small rocks. And we have engineered machines that can transform big rocks into small ones. In fact, I have such a machine in my garage. It’s called a hammer. Some might argue that this isn’t the best use of my time, but I spent about an hour to artisanally manufacture a batch of sand just to hammer this point home. First, you crush the rocks. Then you put them through the sieves to remove the stuff that’s too big or too small. It takes a little extra processing, but this is not grain surgery. And this has a lot of benefits compared to sourcing natural sand. Hard rock quarries and crushing operations are already out there producing coarse aggregates like gravel, so sometimes the smaller stuff is a waste product anyway. It opens up possibilities when natural deposits aren’t available and can move mining operations upland, away from rivers, where the environmental impacts are less severe. And, it can make the concrete stronger. Let me show you what I mean.</p><p>I took some sand out of my kids’ sandbox and put it in a rock tumbler for a week to try and simulate the erosion it might see over years in windswept dunes of a desert. Obviously, this erosion reduced the overall size of the particles. So, I classified both materials with the sieves to make them a closer match for a fair comparison. And both batches are within the spec for concrete sand in the US. Looking in the microscope, you can clearly see the differences. The tumbled sand is rounded with roughly spherical, smooth grains. The manufactured sand is jagged with sharp, angular corners. And watch what happens when I pile them up. I filled up two pieces of pipe with the same amount of sand, and then pulled the pipe away. It’s not a huge difference, but you can see the rounded sand spreads out a little further because the particles have less friction. It makes intuitive sense that concrete made from this sand would be weaker than with this sand. Let’s see if that’s true.</p><p>I mixed up a simple batch of concrete from the crushed sand, and the tumbled sand keeping the weights of all the ingredients equal. Here’s my recipe if you want to try this experiment yourself. Then I molded some concrete cylinders and let them cure for a week. Most concrete mixes are meant to reach their design strength after 28 days, but concrete strength gain is fairly predictable, so the relative difference between the samples should be consistent in time. Most importantly, my little benchtop hydraulic press would not be able to break these samples if I waited that long. And this load cell is not calibrated, so I’m doing this test in arbitrary Practical Engineering units of force. The tumbled sand cylinder broke at around 2500 units. And the manufactured sand concrete broke at 7500 units. You can easily see the difference in the results. “Goodnight!” It was 3 times as strong. Of course, this is my garage, not a testing lab, and I only did one sample because my arm got tired of hammering rocks. Luckily, people much smarter than me have tested this out, and the results are pretty conclusive that, if you keep everything the same, the angularity of fine aggregate increases the strength of concrete. And that’s the story you probably know if you’ve read anything on this topic. It’s the common explanation for why we don’t use dune sand, the most visible of earth’s sand resources, in concrete. It’s intuitive. Rounded grains don’t lock together. Beiser makes the claim not once but three times in his book. But it turns out it’s not that simple, because strength isn’t the only property of concrete that we care about.</p><p>Before concrete has to be strong, it has to be placed. Ask anyone who’s done this kind of work, and they’ll tell you it’s hard. Well, it’s liquid at first, but it’s hard to work with. Concrete is about two-and-a-half times the density of water. It’s heavy stuff, and to get it into the forms often can require a lot of different tools: wheelbarrows, buggies, chutes, pumps, hoses, and more. The better the concrete flows, the easier it is to do a good job of placing it. And that matters. If a mix is too stiff, it can clog up hoses, trap air bubbles, and ultimately lead to poor quality in the installed product. This property of concrete is usually called workability. It’s often measured using a slump test. Fill up a cone of concrete, pull the cone away, and see how far the concrete slumps. But the problem with workability is that, in one big way, it works against strength. And it all has to do with water.</p><p>What happens when the concrete truck shows up to your job site and the mix is too stiff? Depends on if the engineer is there or not, but in a lot of cases, you just tell the driver to add a few gallons of water to the mix. More water; better flow; easier to place. It’s pretty straightforward, but there’s a reason you don’t want the engineer to know: water decreases concrete strength. I’ve done a whole video about this with some garage demos, so again, check that out if you want to learn more. The gist is that the ratio of water to cement is one of the most important factors determining concrete's strength when it cures. Cement isn’t like some types of glue that harden as the water or solvent evaporates. It goes through a chemical reaction, incorporating the water into the final product. That’s why we say concrete “cures” instead of “dries”. But, cement can only react with around 35 percent of its weight in water, so any more than that is just taking up volume in the mix that could be used by the stronger ingredients. More water; less strong. And here’s where the shape of the sand grains comes into play.</p><p>I did a little garage slump test to gauge the workability of those two mixes I made for the earlier demonstration. Here’s the rounded sand mix… and here’s the manufactured sand. “Haha, no slump at all.” Honestly I expected this to be a subtle difference, but it was like night and day. They weren’t even close. So I wondered, what would happen if, instead of holding ingredient ratios constant, I used the workability as the controlled variable? Let’s find out. First I used the manufactured sand with enough water to get it to a workable level. 100 milliliters got it to here, which is a bit better than the first one. Then I did a second mix with the tumbled sand, slowly adding water and running the slump test until it was pretty close. It took only 70 ml of water to make them match, 30% less than the first batch. After a week, I tested the samples. The tumbled sand sample broke at 4,800 units. And the manufactured sand broke at only 4,300 units. The tumbled sand with the rounder grains was stronger this time (by about ten percent), and it’s all due to the lower water content in the mix.</p><p>So yes, if you use the same amount of water, more angular sand like you might find from a river or manufactured sand is better, but that’s not what happens in real construction. I say this with many, many caveats, but very generally, you only add as much water as you need for workability. Rounded sand gives you better workability, so you can add less water, and thus get stronger concrete. This idea that we can’t use wind-blown sands in concrete because of their shape is a myth. In fact, the American Concrete Institute has a bulletin that says it better than I can:</p><p>“The influence of fine aggregate shape and texture on the strength of hardened concrete is almost entirely related to the resulting water-to-cement ratio of the concrete…”</p><p>I tried to track down the original source of this idea that we can’t use rounded grains in concrete, but got nowhere. Beiser cites an article from the UN, which itself cites a 2006 paper about using two types of desert sand from China in concrete. But that paper doesn’t mention the roundness of the particles at all. They didn’t include any measure of the shape of the grains in their study, and they didn’t make any suggestions about how that particular property of the desert sand may have affected the results of their tests. In fact, the conclusion of that paper includes saying that desert sand is a feasible alternative to other types of fine aggregates used in concrete. And the whole reason it was a subject of scientific study at all has to do with size, not shape. This is a widely used specification for the distribution of particle sizes of fine aggregate for concrete. Any sand in this area meets the spec. And here’s the soil used in that paper. Even if the conclusion was that it doesn’t work, I think this would have a lot more to do with the results than the shape of the particles.</p><p>And that really gets to the heart of this whole discussion. Fine aggregates are found throughout the world. We can even make our own. And concrete is like baking; different ingredients can change the end results. But just like regional bread recipes evolved based on the availability of local ingredients, the construction industry has developed a lot of ways to use different local materials to achieve good structural properties. The real challenge, like many things in engineering, is cost.</p><p>It can be more expensive to manufacture sand compared to mining raw materials that can be put directly in a mix, especially when you factor in the other ingredients, like chemical admixtures, that might be required to make it more workable without adding too much water. It’s expensive to transport better quality sand from far away, rather than finding it close to a job site or batch plant. It’s expensive to mine sand in adherence to environmental regulations that are becoming stricter worldwide. It’s catchy to say there’s a scarcity of fine aggregates on earth, but I think it’s misleading. “Sand is getting a lot more expensive than it used to be” just doesn’t make as nice of a headline. And the tricky part is that, in many ways, those costs have always been there; we’ve just externalized them onto the environment and our future.</p><p>All the ingredients in concrete are mined or harvested just like other natural resources. It’s just that concrete is made on a scale that blows most other materials out of the water. It’s a huge business, and there’s lots of money flowing, which means a lot of potential environmental harm and social conflict as a result. That’s especially true in places that don’t have robust oversight and enforcement of how sand is extracted. And I think it’s important to point out that the low-cost of sand, because of its simplicity as a material and its abundance, is a big part of why we use so much concrete in the first place, even in situations where it’s not necessarily the best material choice in other respects. Everything in engineering is a tradeoff, and if the economics around sand change, the engineering and construction industries can change with them. Look at other examples of this. </p><p>Diamond used to be exclusively a mined material, but now we can make it in a lab. Synthetic diamond gemstones used in jewelry are now less expensive than mined diamonds, but, admittedly, there’s a lot more to that economy than the costs to make them. What I think is more interesting is that 99 percent of diamond used in the world for industrial purposes is synthetic. It used to be a rare mineral, but now you can pick up a diamond drill bit or saw blade from the hardware store for a fairly small premium.</p><p>Timber is another example. Natural forests used to be the only source, but now plantations, trees planted specifically for harvest, now make up more than a third of the wood we use globally. And engineered lumber like plywood, OSB, and structural composites can make more efficient use of raw materials. I’m pointing out these examples, not to say they’re good or bad - there are pros and cons in both cases - but just to illustrate how our demand for materials in the construction industry changes with the supply, and how technology can have a huge impact on that. And there’s another parallel between timber and sand: they both can be renewable.</p><p>I had another barrel in the rock tumbler not going to use, so I broke up some chunks of concrete and threw them in. I ran these through the grits, just like you would with any other rock in a tumbler. Concrete is pretty soft compared to most natural rocks, so it didn’t polish up that nicely, but the result is still pretty cool. You can really see the constituent materials of the concrete after it spent so long rolling around in there: the small and large aggregates and the cement paste locking them together. But the point of this demo is that concrete is pretty much just rock, that’s mostly what it’s made of in the first place. And just like the rocks I crushed to create manufactured sand, concrete can be recycled into aggregates that get reused in the construction industry, either in new concrete or other materials, reducing demand for virgin sources.</p><p>There’s a lot changing in the construction industry, and a lot of growth in the need for materials like sand and gravel. But I don’t think it’s fair to say the world is running out of those materials. We’re just more aware of all the costs involved in procuring them, and hopefully taking more account for how they affect our future and the environment.</p>

  Email: stephan dot fassmann at gmail</p><p>You need a Technical Writer. You have developers that have trained extensively to talk to computers often in multiple languages. And it is hard enough to write documentation for other developers. Asking them to create documentation talking to users, system administrators, DevOps and management are even more dialects because they speak in their own jargon, and it costs a lot of their very expensive time. 
I know technology, hardware, software, firmware and more. In tech, medical, aerospace, automotive and IT industries. I can do the translating for developers so they can concentrate on making the hard stuff. 
I also know user experience (UX) I can guide you to make better user interfaces and keep you from making those mistakes that cripple many products.</p></div></td></tr>

I also have a passion for, but am relatively new at, PL work.</p><p>As a bonus, I am a very good teacher, mentor, and public speaker; you can find a number of talks by me on YouTube, including most recently at StaffPlus New York (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkSGJdPyLxQ" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkSGJdPyLxQ</a>).</p></div></td></tr>

Email: me@scottcarlow.com</p><p>I'm probably not the typical resource someone may scour HN for, but it can't hurt to throw my hat in the ring!</p><p>I'm a senior-level IT Infrastructure Engineer. I've spent the past 8 or so years helping startups transform their early-stage IT, slapped together with duct tape and glue, into enterprise-grade scalable systems and processes. I've seen startups through numerous SOCII and ISO 27001 audits, penetration tests, NIST 800-171 assessments, and FINRA audits. I've migrated on-premises workloads in the cloud, built a businesses entire IT infrastructure (office networking gear excluded) to the cloud. I've even worked hand-in-hand with DevOps teams to improve and troubleshoot CI, engineering access to backend services, and IAM architecture. And I loved every minute of it.</p><p>That's why I'm posting here on HN; I like a fast-paced environment where I can re-imagine how things are done!</p><p>My linked resume is for leadership, as I've recently made that shift, but nearly my whole career is as an IC and my accomplishments in my resume are overwhelmingly accomplished as an IC or small team lead.

Email: echo@echonolan.net</p><p>I'm looking for an ML engineering gig. I can help you gather data, preprocess it, design models, train models, etc etc. My ideal job would be doing generative AI stuff with images/audio/video, but I'm open to anywhere there's gradients to descend. Recently I've been working on a project building a text-to-image model that learns solely with unlabeled image data, relying on CLIP for the link between captions and images[1]. I think it's a) cool and b) demonstrative of strong abilities. At a higher level of abstraction you can think of this as embedding guided content synthesis. The model learns to generate images conditioned on their CLIP embedding being within an input spherical cap. If you center the cap on the CLIP embedding of some text you get images that look like they'd have that caption, if you center it on the embedding of another image you get semantically similar images. The radius of the cap determines how similar the outputs are.</p><p>[1]: <a href="https://www.echonolan.net/posts/2024-03-09-is-it-possible-to-train-a-text-to-image-model-without-any-text.html" rel="nofollow">https://www.echonolan.net/posts/2024-03-09-is-it-possible-to...</a> new model that generates better samples coming soon</p></div></td></tr>

Computers are an incredibly powerful tool, and I am always looking for ways to help others take advantage of that power. To that end, I have worked on projects ranging from configuration management (with a focus on deep integration with Linux and commercial Unix platforms) to blockchain (focusing on real-world assets and actual applications for the technology).</p><p>My main technical skills are in systems/lower-level programming. I enjoy the challenge of making complex functionality work in a performance-constrained environment. But I also know that code doesn't live in a vacuum, and I care a lot about making sure what I'm building actually solves problems for the business and the customer. I am always looking for opportunities to work more closely with stakeholders to ensure me and my team are on the right track.</p><p>I have lots of experience supporting interns and junior engineers, and always love opportunities to be a teacher or mentor. Looking for someone to help your team level up on Rust? I could be who you're searching for!</p></div></td></tr>

I chose to build it without any libraries (barring the CRT for startup), which began as a learning exercise, but has taught me the value of simplicity.</p><p>In more recent history I've been working on a metaprogramming system for C. Think C++ templates/constexpr, but somewhat more flexible, and with intelligible error messages. It turns out I have a small passion for compilers. I was also recently contributing to Oil, a new bash runtime and POSIX compliant shell.</p><p>That's the cliff-notes on my technical background. As a person I'm friendly and easy to get along with.

But no politics.</p><p>IMO The interesting part of making software, is the people, while technicals.. are solvable. i can guide people how to _think_ _correctly_.

As a one-man army, I have a proven track record of taking projects from concept to launch across desktop, mobile, and web.</p><p>Here’s a summary of what I’ve been working on over the past 5 years:
www.linkedin.com/posts/manofspirit_opentowork-activity-7237722209241214977-U3ZG</p><p>As a versatile designer and developer, I’ve created UI-based 2D games and applications with multiplayer features, ranging from XR-based Metaverse app WeDream to the NASBA-accredited educational app Earmark CPE, to Scrabble-inspired UGC-based Word Game, and even Ludo and Bonza-inspired puzzle games across various platforms.</p><p>Starting with GameSparks (RIP) in 2014, I’ve since worked with BrainCloud, PlayFab with Azure Scripting, Epic Online Services, and most recently started exploring Xsolla Backend (AcceleratXR). I’ve built fully integrated BAAS games and apps that often include async multiplayer, user-generated content (UGC), social integration (friends, messaging, etc.), tournaments, achievements, leaderboards, and monetization strategies (in-app purchases, subscriptions, virtual currencies, sales, ad mediation, etc.). Additionally, I’ve developed Unity-based admin tools for seamless management of users, content, and reporting.</p><p>On the UI/UX side, I started with Adobe Photoshop 8 and CorelDraw 9 almost 20 years ago; today I design beautiful applications and 2D games while utilizing my development skills to automate design tools for bulk art generation, variations, and solving repetitive tasks. I also leverage AI tools like MidJourney to push beyond creative limits.</p><p>Even though my focus is on the design and development of backend-driven Unity-based apps/games, my diverse skill set and ability to wear multiple hats allow me to seamlessly contribute to every stage of a project—from initial concept and UX design to backend integration, multiplayer systems, and final launch. This versatility enables me to adapt to different roles and challenges, delivering comprehensive solutions that align with the project’s goals.</p><p>If you have any openings that align with these diverse skills, I’d love to connect and explore how I can contribute.</p></div></td></tr>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      
      <h2 id="first-a-small-detour">
  First a small detour
  
</h2>
<p>I program in Objective-C and Swift daily, because those are the languages that Apple requires developers to use to build software for their platform. It’s not a strict requirement to use any of these two languages if you go cross-platform, but for good integration you would eventually have to write platform code in them.</p>
<p>After using Swift for more than 5 years I can confidently say that it’s getting worse with each addition, very similar to how C++ ended up being the monster it is. In comparison, Objective-C is simpler, somewhat minimalistic, and yet it did a great job for many Mac developers for a long time. I’ve heard that Swift code leads to less crashes and better performance, but that’s not what I’ve experienced. Well written Objective-C code can be easy to understand as much as well written Swift code. But overly complex Swift code is much more difficult to maintain and understand than similar Objective-C code.</p>
<h2 id="what-does-common-lisp-have-to-do-with-any-of-this">
  What does Common Lisp have to do with any of this?
  
</h2>
<p>I started developing in <a href="https://lisp-lang.org/">Common Lisp</a> around 12 years ago and was always fascinated by it. The developer experience, for such an old language with old tools (Emacs + Slime for example), compared to Visual Studio Code and a modern language is still unmatched. You really have to get into it for a few months of writing code, debugging and inspecting to understand the full power of the environment. It feels like you are <a href="https://jackrusher.com/strange-loop-2022/">evolving a living organism</a>, adding ADN to it, watching it take shape while it’s going around doing stuff, inspecting its internals. It is a fun, fulfilling and liberating experience.</p>
<p>Often developers say how you can make a mess of a Common Lisp codebase because of such freedom it provides. But isn’t that the same with any language? The world is full of horrible, inscrutable messes made in C++, Java, Swift and Rust. Any language in the hands of the wrong developer will provide enough (or not enough) power to create such messes. What Common Lisp gives you is great abstraction tools to build software in the simplest way, without having to create odd contortions to fit a type system and satisfy the compiler.</p>
<p>I can probably hear the rustacean over there saying how a properly constructed Rust program, once it compiles will work without bugs, to which I’ll laugh loudly thinking of all the bugs that I had to fix in statically typed languages that were not caught by the compiler. The reality is that you need unit tests anyway, for any program written in any language.</p>
<p>But the easy with which you can inspect a running Common Lisp program to see what’s wrong with it, by calling functions on the REPL, makes for a faster interaction than compiling in an IDE, running the program and setting a breakpoint where the stuff you intend to debug is being called. It cannot be overestimated how much this helps in building stuff faster.</p>
<h2 id="does-any-of-this-really-matter">
  Does any of this really matter?
  
</h2>
<p>Any day to day programming job can be difficult, challenging and also boring. Common Lisp, at least, takes the boring out of it. I really don’t understand how Go developers can build software without feeling soulless with such a dumb language. There are practicalities built into the language for sure, but overall it feels very bland. One consequence of it being such an easy and simple language is that it gathered a strong community and lots of libraries. It was designed so you can toss N amount of developers + Go and software comes at the other end.</p>
<p>But for the love of God (the one you prefer), it makes programming such a repetitive task. How long before Copilot is able to write all the code any Go developer now writes by hand?</p>
<p>Perhaps this rant is because I see programming as a creative activity, such as writing a novel, more than as an engineering discipline. That doesn’t mean that I don’t write unit tests, documentation or use CI.</p>
<p>So every single day, after work, I reach out to Common Lisp for writing my personal project (next business). It feels like I have superpowers, as if I’m understood by some very old wise man that’s there for me when I shape my program. It also helps that the language specification is set in stone and won’t change at the whim <a href="https://www.swift.org/swift-evolution/">of the community</a>. Just take a look, as an example, at that list. Never ending changes that will make your code constantly obsolete. The same is happening with C++, except modern C++ changes are probably welcome by most codebases. But still, there’s a ton of crap added to every version of the standard library. More gotchas to be aware of, more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undefined_behavior">UBs</a>.</p>
<p>Life is limited to keep thinking about ever changing stuff. Language designers making the same mistakes other designers made in the past, and the community always pressuring for more bells and whistles <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ahvzDzKdB0">(If you are into PL design, watch this video)</a>, more syntatic sugar, exerting its power over original designers of the languages. So turning to Common Lisp is always a breath of fresh air, and that’s why my next project is being built with it.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  
    <p>ProductHunt has over 1 million user signups.
More than 60% of those are bots.</p>

<h2>How it started</h2>

<p>I’ve used <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.producthunt.com/">ProductHunt</a> since early 2014.
Besides <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>, it was a good way to see the latest product launches in tech.
Using the comments on products, I could discover similar tools or collect feedback on my own products.
Lately though, I’ve noticed most of the comments seem to be generated by ChatGPT.</p>

<h2>A simple test</h2>

<p>To test my theory, I launched my own product on ProductHunt but with a simple LLM prompt injection in the product’s description.
Sure enough, almost all the comments were automated.</p>

<p><img src="https://wakatime.com/static/img/blog/ph/comments.png" alt="Comments screenshot" title="Comments screenshot"></p>

<p>Can you spot the bots?</p>

<p>Now we see that it’s a waste of time for people launching on ProductHunt to reply to comments.
Is launching on ProductHunt even worth it?
If so many bots are commenting, they must be upvoting too right?
Based on all the emails I receive offering votes for money, some people must be purchasing upvotes.</p>

<h2>The data</h2>

<p>To analyze upvotes, I found a dump of all ProductHunt users, launches, upvotes, and comments.
ProductHunt has over 1 million user sign ups, over 300 thousand launches, 2.5 million comments, and 20 million upvotes.
Each launch also came with the daily rank, which is the rank of the launch after 24 hours from midnight PDT when each new launch day starts.</p>

<h2>Detecting bot accounts</h2>

<p>Detecting bots is difficult, especially with only public data.
At first, I tried analyzing the times of day of user comments to find trends.
For example, here’s one user who signed up 677 days ago, commented 2,009 times and upvoted 4,649 launches.
Definitely a power user and using some automation, but probably not a bot (and wasn’t categorized as one).</p>

<p>Now look at a bot user’s comments.
This user signed up 140 days ago, commented 173 times and upvoted 246 launches.</p>

<p><img src="https://wakatime.com/static/img/blog/ph/user-comment-hours-hist-bot.png" alt="Comments by hour histogram bot" title="Comments by hour histogram bot"></p>

<p>Notice how the bot comments at regular intervals and the chart looks boxy instead of smooth?</p>

<p>However, this wasn’t enough to detect bot accounts alone.
I assigned each user a risk score based on many different criteria, like account activity duration, upvote patterns over time, and content of comments.
Did you know ChatGPT generated comments have a higher frequency of words like <code>game-changer</code>?
Bot comments also contained characters not easily typeable, like <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dash#Em_dash">em-dash</a>.
They also commonly included the name and bio word for word from a real person’s LinkedIn profile, but those people said they never created any ProductHunt account.
In the end, I detected over 60% of user signups to be automated bot accounts.
That’s a conservative number, because I didn’t detect all the bots.
It would be a lot easier for ProductHunt themselves to detect bot activity more accurately using insider data.</p>

<h2>Bot activity over time</h2>

<h3>User signups</h3>

<p>Since 2018, there have been more bot users created than real users.</p>

<p><img src="https://wakatime.com/static/img/blog/ph/Bot%20vs%20Real%20Signups%20(Line%20Chart).png" alt="Bot User Signups" title="Bot User Signups"></p>

<h3>Comments</h3>

<p>In late 2022, bot comments really took off... around the same time ChatGPT was first widely available.
The spike in 2024 is because over time bot accounts are deleted, I’m not sure if by ProductHunt or by the account owner.
Newer accounts are more likely to not have been deleted, so we still have access to their comments.</p>

<p><img src="https://wakatime.com/static/img/blog/ph/Bot%20vs%20Real%20Comments%20(Line%20Chart).png" alt="Bot Comments" title="Bot Comments"></p>

<h3>Upvotes</h3>

<p>Also in 2022, bot upvotes surpassed real votes.</p>

<p><img src="https://wakatime.com/static/img/blog/ph/Bot%20vs%20Real%20Votes%20(Line%20Chart).png" alt="Bot Votes" title="Bot Votes"></p>

<p>These bots form voting rings where makers pay for upvotes to increase their chances of getting into the ProductHunt newsletter.</p>

<h3>Rankings</h3>

<p>Most launches get only a few real upvotes.
Since bots vote randomly to blend in, the bot trend line is smoother than the real user upvotes.</p>

<p><img src="https://wakatime.com/static/img/blog/ph/Posts%20By%20Votes%20(Line%20Chart).png" alt="Count of launches grouped by number of votes" title="Count of launches grouped by number of votes"></p>

<h2>Daily rank</h2>

<p>First place launches get featured in the daily and weekly ProductHunt newsletter, so let’s see how many bot upvotes the top launches receive.</p>

<p><img src="https://wakatime.com/static/img/blog/ph/Posts%20in%20First%20Place%20by%20Bot%20Votes.png" alt="Launches in first place by number of bot votes" title="Launches in first place by number of bot votes"></p>

<p>Looks like 15% bot votes is a safe amount to get your product in first place for the day.
Anything over 60% bot votes doesn’t seem to make it to first place for some reason.
Here’s the same chart limited to launches after 2020, showing bots are accounting for more of the upvotes in top posts lately.</p>

<p><img src="https://wakatime.com/static/img/blog/ph/Posts%20in%20First%20Place%20by%20Bot%20Votes%20since%202020.png" alt="Launches in first place by number of bot votes since 2020" title="Launches in first place by number of bot votes since 2020"></p>

<p>Launches paying for upvotes probably aren’t high quality products, so they often rank top 5 instead of first place:</p>

<p><img src="https://wakatime.com/static/img/blog/ph/Posts%20in%20Top%205%20by%20Bot%20Votes%20since%202020.png" alt="Launches in top 5 by number of bot votes since 2020" title="Launches in top 5 by number of bot votes since 2020"></p>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>I wanted to create a list of launches without the bot votes, to see if the top launch of the day changes with the bot votes are removed.
However, I don’t want to call out launches that didn’t really pay for votes but just happen to have many upvotes from bots, and I don’t want more publicity for the launches that did pay.
Either way, I’ve spent too much time on this already so that will have to wait for a possible future blog post.</p>

        <p>The Dutch government has sent 288 artifacts stolen from Indonesia during the archipelago’s colonial era, among them weapons, coins, jewelry and textiles, back to their home country.</p>

<p>“These objects should never have been here,” says <a href="https://www.government.nl/government/members-of-cabinet/eppo-bruins">Eppo Bruins</a>, the Dutch minister of education, culture and science, per <a href="https://www.dutchnews.nl/2024/09/nl-returns-indonesian-art-which-should-never-have-been-here/"><em>Dutch News</em></a>. “There was looting and pillaging going on in the colonial period and other types of involuntary loss of cultural objects. It is a matter of material justice to return them.”</p>

<p>The September 20 ceremony at the <a href="https://amsterdam.wereldmuseum.nl/en?_gl=1%2A1iotms3%2A_gcl_au%2AMTcwODAyODEzNy4xNzI3NDQ3Mjgy%2A_ga%2AMTkzNjEzNzE1Mi4xNzI3NDQ3Mjgy%2A_ga_96W70H259F%2AMTcyNzQ0NzI4MS4xLjAuMTcyNzQ0NzI4Mi4wLjAuMA..%2A_ga_TPGM95SP38%2AMTcyNzQ0NzI4Mi4xLjEuMTcyNzQ0NzI4Mi42MC4wLjA.">World Museum</a> in Amsterdam marked the second time that the Netherlands has returned stolen artifacts to its former colonies since 2020, when the independent <a href="https://committee.kolonialecollecties.nl/">Colonial Collections Committee</a> issued a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/09/arts/design/dutch-restitution-report.html">report</a> advising the country to do so. The <a href="https://www.government.nl/latest/news/2023/07/06/colonial-collections-to-be-returned-to-indonesia-and-sri-lanka">first repatriation</a> took place in July 2023, when the Dutch government returned 478 objects to Indonesia and Sri Lanka.</p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://www.government.nl/latest/news/2024/09/20/for-second-time-cultural-artefacts-to-be-returned-to-indonesia">statement</a>, the trove of newly returned artifacts includes four Hindu-Buddhist sculptures. One of the works, a likeness of the god <a href="https://committee.kolonialecollecties.nl/binaries/commissioncolonialcollections/documenten/advisory-reports/2024/08/28/indonesia/Recommendation+Ganesha.pdf">Ganesha</a>, was shipped to the Netherlands from East Java in 1843 on the orders of a colonial administrator. The <a href="https://committee.kolonialecollecties.nl/binaries/commissioncolonialcollections/documenten/advisory-reports/2024/08/28/indonesia/Recommendation+Brahma.pdf">other three</a>, depicting the gods Bhairava, Nandi and Brahma, were taken from Singasari, a late 13th-century temple complex in East Java, in the mid-19th century.</p>

<p>But the bulk of the repatriated items came to the Netherlands in the aftermath of a 1906 <a href="https://amsterdam.wereldmuseum.nl/en/whats-on/exhibitions/bali-behind-scenes/tourism-and-colonialism">war in southern Bali</a>, in which the Dutch military attacked the kingdoms of Badung and Tabanan.</p>

<p>“Around 1,000 Balinese were killed, while the Dutch lost four men,” writes the <a href="https://www.theartnewspaper.com/2024/09/20/netherlands-to-return-288-items-looted-in-colonial-era-to-indonesia"><em>Art Newspaper</em></a>’s<em> </em>Catherine Hickley. “A week later, in the kingdom of Tabanan, the Dutch army attacked the palace and arrested the king, who together with the crown prince, [died by] suicide that night.”</p>

<p>An <a href="https://committee.kolonialecollecties.nl/binaries/commissioncolonialcollections/documenten/advisory-reports/2024/08/28/indonesia/Recommendation+Puputan+Badung.pdf">advisory report</a> issued by the Colonial Collections Committee divides the objects into several categories: “official loot” like the belongings of deposed Balinese kings, confiscated coins and weapons, and artifacts from the personal holdings of a <a href="https://wojnieuwenkamp.nl/en/the-artist/">Dutch artist</a> who purchased or otherwise acquired items linked to the 1906 conflict. The Indonesian government officially requested the return of these culturally significant objects, collectively known as the Puputan Badung Collection, last September.</p>

<p>Per the statement, the committee is currently preparing recommendations for additional repatriation requests from Nigeria, Sri Lanka, India and Indonesia. While some critics of repatriation have raised concerns over how poorer countries will care for their returned artifacts, <a href="https://leiden.wereldmuseum.nl/en/about-volkenkunde/press/marieke-van-bommel-new-managing-director">Marieke van Bommel</a>, director general of the National Museum of World Cultures, tells the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/20/world/europe/netherlands-indonesia-artifacts.html"><em>New York Times</em></a>’ Lynsey Chutel that “the thief cannot tell the rightful owners what to do with their property.”</p>

  <time datetime="2024-10-01">October 1, 2024</time>
	
<p>GitHub Issues has been how the world’s best software teams collaborate since it first launched in <a href="https://github.blog/news-insights/the-library/github-issue-tracker/">2009</a>. Today we are excited to unveil a major evolution of issues and projects, featuring a range of highly requested enhancements including sub-issues, issue types and advanced search for issues. Together, these additions make it easier than ever to break down work, visualize progress, categorize and find just the right issue in GitHub.</p>
<p>These new features are now available in public preview for you to try. To gain access for your organization, please sign up <a href="https://github.com/features/issues/signup">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="organize-your-work-with-issue-types">📁 Organize your work with issue types<a href="#organize-your-work-with-issue-types" aria-label="📁 Organize your work with issue types"></a></h2>
<p>Issues types allow you to classify and manage your issues with a shared and consistent language across all repositories in an organization. You can quickly understand the progress of your bug backlog, find all of the high level initiatives teams are working on, and understand the breakdown of work in a project.</p>

<p>From the repository issues page, you can build advanced searches using the <code>AND</code> and <code>OR</code> keywords and parentheses for nested searches. This allows you to build more complex filters to find the exact set of issues you’re looking for.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1cd73066-8226-4572-97e6-05dd5992bd7f" alt="A user searches for type bug OR type task" loading="lazy"></p>

<h2 id="issues-ui-updates">🎨 Issues UI updates<a href="#issues-ui-updates" aria-label="🎨 Issues UI updates"></a></h2>
<p>All these new features are based upon an update to the issues front end, designed to be fast and familiar. This means there are no new UI patterns to slow you down, but we did include a few tweaks to speed you up, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>The issues index page has a new filter bar with autocomplete and syntax highlighting.</li>
<li>Creating multiple issues is faster with a ‘create more’ option to quickly get back to the creation screen.</li>
<li>Issue form and templates are now presented in alphabetical order based on file name, making it easier for you to set just the right order.</li>
<li>Easily share the URL to an issue with a new ‘copy link’ button.</li>
<li>On long issues, selecting ‘load more’ will now fetch 150 events instead of 50.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="increased-items-in-github-projects">♾️ Increased items in GitHub Projects<a href="#increased-items-in-github-projects" aria-label="♾️ Increased items in GitHub Projects"></a></h2>
<p>Earlier this year, we introduced the <a href="https://github.blog/changelog/2024-02-12-github-issues-projects-projects-without-limits-private-beta/">private beta of increased project item limits</a>, expanding the capacity from 1,200 to 50,000 items in a project. Today, we’re expanding the audience for these increased limits.</p>
<p>Since the private beta, we’ve added support for slice by, swimlanes, and GraphQL API. We’ve also fixed your top bug reports and made performance improvements.</p>
<p>If you’re a project admin and your project is approaching the item limit without utilizing Insights (our only currently unsupported feature), a banner will appear over your project to notify you.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1b0efffa-11b3-43ed-9065-56afd2278a67" alt="The sign up banner for the increased items waitlist" width="700" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>As this update is on a project by project basis rather than per organization, to join, just click the “Join beta” button on eligible projects.</p>

              <p>Software developers who publish their products on third-party stores face all kinds of problems sometimes. From rejected apps or extensions to removed products or unjustified claims about them.</p>
<p>Raymond "gorhill" Hill, maker of the world's most popular content blocker uBlock Origin received two emails from Mozilla recently about his Firefox add-on <a href="https://www.ghacks.net/2022/09/09/ublock-origin-minus-an-experimental-manifest-v3-compatible-extension/" data-wpel-link="internal">uBlock Origin Lite</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Good to know:</strong> uBlock Origin Lite is a Manifest V3-compatible version of the content blocker. It is less powerful, but since Google is disabling Manifest V2 support in Chrome, it is what will remain from uBlock Origin for Chromium-based browsers.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.ghacks.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ublock-origin-lite-firefox.png" alt="uBlock Origin Lite Firefox" width="1587" height="1203" srcset="https://www.ghacks.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ublock-origin-lite-firefox.png 1587w, https://www.ghacks.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ublock-origin-lite-firefox-768x582.png 768w, https://www.ghacks.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ublock-origin-lite-firefox-1536x1164.png 1536w, https://www.ghacks.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ublock-origin-lite-firefox-1200x910.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1587px) 100vw, 1587px"></p>
<p>Mozilla <a href="https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uBOL-home/issues/197" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">says</a> that it has reviewed the extension and found violations. The following claims were made:</p>
<ul>
<li>The extension is not asking for consent for data collecting.</li>
<li>The extension contains "minified, concatenated or otherwise machine-generated code".</li>
<li>There is no privacy policy.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a consequence, Mozilla disabled the extension on the Firefox Add-ons Store.</p>
<p>Hill refuted all three claims that Mozilla made on the GitHub repository stating that the extension is not collecting any data, that there is no minified code in uBlock Origin Lite, and that there is a privacy policy.</p>
<p>He admitted further that he does not "have the time or motivation to spend time on this nonsense" and won't react to the allegations made or appeal the decision.</p>
<p>In a follow-up, Hill criticized the "nonsensical and hostile review process" that put added burden on developers. Mozilla disabled all versions of the extension except for the very first one. It still flagged the extension for the very same reasons, but nevertheless decided to keep the outdated version up.</p>
<p><strong>Does it affect uBlock Origin?</strong> The core extension remains available for Firefox. Unlike Google Chrome, Firefox will continue to support Manifest V2 extensions. Mozilla has not flagged this extensions or disabled it.</p>
<p>Hill is now self-hosting the extension uBlock Origin Lite for Firefox on the GitHub repository. Interested users find it <a href="https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uBOL-home/releases" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">on the releases page</a> as a direct download.</p>
<h2>Mozilla realizes its blunder, but it seems too late</h2>
<p>Mozilla contacted Hill a few days later, likely after the thing blew up everywhere, stating that the "previous decision was incorrect" and that the extension has been restored.</p>
<p>The organization issued an apology for the "mistake"&nbsp; and recommended to Hill to reach out whenever he has questions or concerns about a review.</p>
<p>Hill decided to go ahead with the plan to self-host the extension. He removed the extension from Mozilla's Add-ons repository as a consequence.</p>
<p>When you search for uBlock Origin Lite, you won't get the extension returned anymore.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen if the two parties will come closer together again or if this breakup will be permanent.</p>
<h3>Closing Words</h3>
<p>Most mistakes in review processes are made by machines. Google, for example, uses automated reviews for the most part, but may also manually review extensions.</p>
<p>The process does not keep all malicious extensions out, of which <a href="https://www.ghacks.net/2023/06/05/75-million-chrome-users-have-installed-these-malicious-extensions/" data-wpel-link="internal">plenty</a> <a href="https://www.ghacks.net/2021/05/18/dont-download-this-microsoft-authenticator-extension-for-chrome-it-is-fake/" data-wpel-link="internal">are</a> <a href="https://www.ghacks.net/2023/12/23/google-removes-3-fake-vpn-extensions-with-1-5-million-users-from-chrome-web-store/" data-wpel-link="internal">regularly</a> discovered,&nbsp; but it may also <a href="https://www.ghacks.net/2021/03/25/the-curious-case-of-clearurls-removal-from-the-google-chrome-webstore/" data-wpel-link="internal">block legitimate extensions</a> or updates.</p>
<p>In the case of uBlock Origin Lite, it is unclear how the reviewer came to the conclusion that the extension was in violation of policies. Especially the claim that the extension had no privacy policy, when it clearly had one, sheds no good light on the reviewer and process.</p>
<p>Mozilla might want to look at the review process to find out what went wrong exactly to avoid another disaster like it in the future.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p id="speakable-summary">A Y Combinator startup named PearAI launched <a rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/CodeFryingPan/status/1840203597478539477">with an X post thread </a>and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18cHBU05zK0">YouTube video</a> on Saturday and created immediate controversy. And some of that is splashing onto YC itself.</p>

<p>PearAI offers an AI coding editor. The startup’s founder Duke Pan has openly said that it’s <a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/trypear/pearai-app">a cloned copy</a> of another AI editor called Continue, which was covered under the Apache open source license. But PearAI made a major misstep: PearAI originally slapped its own made-up closed license on it, called the Pear Enterprise License, which Pan admitted was written by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/ns123abc/status/1840481220188111076/photo/1">ChatGPT.</a></p>

	
	


<p>Changing a license like this is a big deal in the open source world. Not only are there legalities involved in violating a software license, but it defeats the whole purpose of open source, which is about community building, sharing, and contributing. In an apology PearAI’s Pan posted <a rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/CodeFryingPan/status/1840831339337302204">on Monday</a>, he said that the project has now been released under the same Apache open source license as the original project.</p>

<p>The launch thread went viral with thousands of comments by Sunday. Some were congratulatory, but others were vicious in pointing out the licensing and the fact that PearAI wasn’t so much a fork with new stuff added, but a replica with a new name. Pan admitted as much in his apology.</p>

<p>So many angry comments were made on Pan’s launch thread that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/dejavucoder/status/1840445397002543442?t=Tn--wZgbxhMe-db1Dmcxvg&amp;s=19"> X put a community note</a> on it that read: “Pear is a fork of Continue.dev, an open-source AI code editor. PearAI used Continue.dev’s code and mass-replaced all references to ‘Continue’ to ‘PearAI’ to mislead people into believing that they built this product on their own.”</p>

<p>This note wasn’t accurate, either. PearAI did say in some of its materials that the project was a clone (also known as a fork) of Continue as well as the original project that Continued used, VSCode. X subsequently removed that note.</p>

<p>Pan apologized for how hard it was to find that information, too. He said that one way he and his cofounder, Nang Ang, “screwed up, critically, was not being clear enough about this … doing so upon a fork of others’ work without many new features, and talking about it so publicly online, made it look like we were stealing the work of others as our own.”</p>


	
	


<p>On Sunday, Continue jumped in with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://twitter.com/continuedev/status/1840601490827989368">by posting</a> a subtle threat that it was “ecstatic to see the ecosystem that has formed around us. But open source can’t be taken for granted—it is a movement built on trust, and on respect for contributions, licenses, and intellectual property.”</p>

	
	


<p>Y Combinator CEO Garry Tan got involved, too. He defended PearAI with several <a rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/garrytan/status/1840490867280498873">tweets</a>. “Don’t understand why people are dragging a new project when literally it’s open source Apache license and that’s *the reason* why open source is awesome” one read. As you might imagine, people pointed out that it was changed to an Apache license after the uproar.</p>

<p>There were other reasons this project caught ire. Pan boasted how he “just quit my 270 000$ job at Coinbase” to do this startup, even though this was about as far from an original idea as a startup can get. In addition to Continue, another big competitor is Cursor.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On top of that, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies?query=AI%20code%20editor">YC has funded two other AI code editors already, Void and Melty</a>, as the mob was quick to point out. To which Tan <a rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/garrytan/status/1840490996528029942">replied on X</a>, “More choice is good, people building is good, if you don’t like it don’t use it.”</p>

<p>Others criticized YC for selecting PearAI into its cohort at all. Blogger Sven Schnieders <a rel="nofollow" href="https://unfashionable.blog/p/yc/">wrote</a> that PearAI is an example of the “the decline of YC” because it accepted a company that is “nothing more than a codebase copied from another YC-backed company.”</p>

<p>On <a rel="nofollow" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41701265">Hacker News,</a> the site for programmers owned by YC, a commenter wrote that the debacle “says more about YC than this particular founder (lots of these types nowadays): i.e. their process, their due diligence.” Another wrote, “Is it typical for VC to just throw money at projects without any sort of oversight/auditing of, oh jeez, IDK, Licensing/Legal issues?”</p>

	
	


<p>YC’s plans to double from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/13/y-combinator-expanding-to-four-cohorts-a-year-in-2025/#:~:text=Silicon%20Valley%20startup%20accelerator%20Y,Thursday%2C%20and%20TechCrunch%20confirmed%20today.">two cohorts a year to four</a> isn’t likely to ease this perception, or this risk. </p>

<p>The whole uproar probably says as much about how eager all VCs are to fund AI startups as it does about YC’s love of this particular ilk of them.</p>

<p>Tan could not be immediately reached for comment. PearAI did not have further comment.</p>

<p>If you use Firefox and the uBlock Origin Lite content blocker from the Firefox Add-ons Store, be aware that the extension is no longer supported. Raymond Hill, the maker of the extension, pulled support and moved uBlock Origin Lite to self-hosting after multiple encounters with a "nonsensical and hostile" review process from the store review team.</p>

<p>It all started in early September when Mozilla flagged every version of the uBlock Origin Lite extension as violating its policies. Reviewers then claimed the extension apparently collected user data and contained "minified, concatenated or otherwise machine-generated code." The developer seemingly debunked those allegations, saying that "it takes only a few seconds for anyone who has even basic understanding of JavaScript to see the raised issues make no sense."</p>

<p>Raymond Hill <span>decided to drop the extension from the store and move it to a self-hosted version. This means that </span><span>those who want to continue using uBlock Origin Lite on Firefox should download the latest version <a href="https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uBOL-home">from GitHub</a> (it can auto-update itself).</span></p>

                            <!-- PLACE THIS SECTION INSIDE OF YOUR BODY WHERE YOU WANT THE VIDEO PLAYER TO RENDER -->
            <p>The last message from the developer in a <a href="https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uBOL-home/issues/197#issuecomment-2377395301">now-closed GitHub issue</a> shows an email from Mozilla admitting its fault and apologizing for the mistake. However, Raymond still pulled the extension from the Mozilla Add-ons Store, which means you can no longer find it on <a href="http://addons.mozilla.org/">addons.mozilla.org</a>.</p>

<p>It is worth noting that the original uBlock Origin for Firefox is still available and supported. The Lite version is a Manifest V3-based extension with a lighter and more efficient load on resources, such as processor and memory. Hill recently <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/ublock-origin-developer-recommends-switching-to-ublock-lite-as-chrome-flags-the-extension/">recommended switching to uBlockOrigin Lite</a> after Chrome started flagging the extension as unsupported (<a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/official-windows-registry-hack-extends-ublock-origin-support-on-google-chrome-edge/">there is a way to circumvent that</a>). Contrary to Chrome, Mozilla does not plan to drop the Manifest V2-based extensions in the near future, so uBlock Origin will continue to exist and work on Firefox and other browsers with MV2 support.</p>

<h3>Press Release</h3>


<p>26 September 2024</p>




<p>Astronomers have published a gigantic infrared map of the Milky Way containing more than 1.5 billion objects ― the most detailed one ever made. Using the European Southern Observatory’s VISTA telescope, the team monitored the central regions of our Galaxy over more than 13 years. At 500 terabytes of data, this is the largest observational project ever carried out with an ESO telescope.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“<em>We made so many discoveries, we have changed the view of our Galaxy forever,</em>” says Dante Minniti, an astrophysicist at Universidad Andrés Bello in Chile who led the overall project.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This record-breaking map comprises 200 000 images taken by ESO’s <a href="http://www.eso.org/public/teles-instr/surveytelescopes/vista/">VISTA</a> ― the Visible and Infrared Survey Telescope for Astronomy. Located at ESO’s <a href="https://www.eso.org/public/teles-instr/paranal-observatory/">Paranal Observatory</a> in Chile, the telescope’s main purpose is to map large areas of the sky. The team used VISTA’s infrared camera <a href="https://www.eso.org/public/teles-instr/paranal-observatory/surveytelescopes/vista/camera/">VIRCAM</a>, which can peer through the dust and gas that permeates our galaxy. It is therefore able to see the radiation from the Milky Way’s most hidden places, opening a unique window onto our galactic surroundings.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This gigantic dataset <a href="#1">[1]</a> covers an area of the sky equivalent to 8600 full moons, and contains about 10 times more objects than <a href="https://www.eso.org/public/images/eso1242a/">a previous map released by the same team</a> back in 2012. It includes newborn stars, which are often embedded in dusty cocoons, and globular clusters –– dense groups of millions of the oldest stars in the Milky Way. Observing infrared light means VISTA can also spot very cold objects, which glow at these wavelengths, like brown dwarfs (‘failed’ stars that do not have sustained nuclear fusion) or free-floating planets that don’t orbit a star.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The observations began in 2010 and ended in the first half of 2023, spanning a total of 420 nights. By observing each patch of the sky many times, the team was able to not only determine the locations of these objects, but also track how they move and whether their brightness changes. They charted stars whose luminosity changes periodically that can be used as cosmic rulers for measuring distances <a href="#2">[2]</a>. This has given us an accurate 3D view of the inner regions of the Milky Way, which were previously hidden by dust. The researchers also tracked hypervelocity stars — fast-moving stars catapulted from the central region of the Milky Way after a close encounter with the supermassive black hole lurking there.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The new map contains data gathered as part of the VISTA Variables in the Vía Láctea (<a href="https://vvvsurvey.org/about/about-vvv/">VVV</a>) survey <a href="#3">[3]</a> and its companion project, the VVV eXtended (VVVX) survey. “<em>The project was a monumental effort, made possible because we were surrounded by a great team</em>,” says Roberto Saito, an astrophysicist at the Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina in Brazil and lead author of the paper published today in <em>Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics</em> on the completion of the project.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The VVV and VVVX surveys have already led to more than 300 scientific articles. With the surveys now complete, the scientific exploration of the gathered data will continue for decades to come. Meanwhile, ESO’s Paranal Observatory is being prepared for the future: VISTA will be updated with its new instrument <a href="https://www.eso.org/public/teles-instr/paranal-observatory/surveytelescopes/vista/4most/">4MOST</a> and ESO's Very Large Telescope (<a href="https://www.eso.org/public/teles-instr/paranal-observatory/vlt/">VLT</a>) will receive its <a href="https://www.eso.org/public/teles-instr/paranal-observatory/vlt/vlt-instr/moons/">MOONS</a> instrument. Together, they will provide <a href="https://www.eso.org/public/teles-instr/technology/spectroscopy/">spectra</a> of millions of the objects surveyed here, with countless discoveries to be expected.</p>
<h3>Notes</h3><p dir="ltr"><a name="1"></a>[1] The dataset is too large to release as a single image, but the processed data and objects catalogue can be accessed in the <a href="https://archive.eso.org/scienceportal/home">ESO Science Portal</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a name="2"></a>[2] One way to measure the distance to a star is by comparing how bright it appears as seen from Earth to how intrinsically bright it is; but the latter is often unknown. Certain types of stars change their brightness periodically, and there is a very strong connection between how quickly they do this and how intrinsically luminous they are. Measuring these fluctuations allows astronomers to work out how luminous these stars are, and therefore how far away they lie.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a name="3"></a>[3] Vía Láctea is the Latin name for the Milky Way.</p>
<h3>More information</h3><p dir="ltr">This research was presented in a paper entitled “The VISTA Variables in the Vía Láctea eXtended (VVVX) ESO public survey: Completion of the observations and legacy” published in <em>Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics</em> (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/202450584">https://doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/202450584</a>).

<p dir="ltr">The European Southern Observatory (ESO) enables scientists worldwide to discover the secrets of the Universe for the benefit of all. We design, build and operate world-class observatories on the ground — which astronomers use to tackle exciting questions and spread the fascination of astronomy — and promote international collaboration for astronomy. Established as an intergovernmental organisation in 1962, today ESO is supported by 16 Member States (Austria, Belgium, Czechia, Denmark, France, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom), along with the host state of Chile and with Australia as a Strategic Partner. ESO’s headquarters and its visitor centre and planetarium, the ESO Supernova, are located close to Munich in Germany, while the Chilean Atacama Desert, a marvellous place with unique conditions to observe the sky, hosts our telescopes. ESO operates three observing sites: La Silla, Paranal and Chajnantor. At Paranal, ESO operates the Very Large Telescope and its Very Large Telescope Interferometer, as well as survey telescopes such as VISTA. Also at Paranal ESO will host and operate the Cherenkov Telescope Array South, the world’s largest and most sensitive gamma-ray observatory. Together with international partners, ESO operates ALMA on Chajnantor, a facility that observes the skies in the millimetre and submillimetre range. At Cerro Armazones, near Paranal, we are building “the world’s biggest eye on the sky” — ESO’s Extremely Large Telescope. From our offices in Santiago, Chile we support our operations in the country and engage with Chilean partners and society.&nbsp;</p>

This meme is so true.

<img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GYxoao2XQAUSgto?format=jpg&amp;name=large" width="600px">

How can the boxed price of a game (or software) be the same as its Steam or digital version?

When you buy a game digitally, it never truly belongs to you; services like Steam or PS Store only allow you to download and play it.

20 years later, you can plug in your Atari cartridge and play, but you can’t be sure that Steam won’t go bankrupt and deactivate its servers. (Nintendo recently closed its shops, including for the 3DS, PSP servers are shut down, etc.)

Right now, if you want to feel nostalgic and buy and play Need for Speed Underground 2, there's nowhere you can do that because it’s abandonware, a forgotten software.

Thousands of people are dumping and archiving games, shows, and movies, trying to keep them accessible with their own means, while companies and lobbies label them as criminals.

Neither side is innocent—piracy is not theft, but let's admit, it is unfair. (I’m excluding small indie developers here as they are both affordable and individual creators.) The companies, with their excessive pricing, instead of selling their products once, turn them into SaaS with lifetime monthly subscriptions. They sell games for $60 and then add microtransactions, turning them into service games. Due to their greed, when things go wrong, they protect themselves and secretly keep the rights to leave you at a loss.

The streaming platforms, for which you pay full price, don’t even let you choose the quality of the movie you want to watch. What you watch today might disappear from all platforms in two months.

Without the people who dump and archive these contents, the old series you love so much could disappear forever.

We pay dozens of lira for five streaming platforms per month, yet they still force us to watch from hdfilmcehennemi.

Look, no one pirates music anymore—first thanks to the iTunes revolution and then Spotify. Pirated music is almost gone (you can check torrent sites’ seed ratios in music versus games and movies categories).

The reason for this is simple: these applications make you feel like the money you pay is truly worth it. You can access almost the entire world archive with a search, and at a really affordable price.

Because of reasons like this, the piracy problem is still not solved. The people who do it are content with their situation. Are they doing the right thing? No. But the companies whining about this should look at themselves before blaming the users.

                                        <p>PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Dockworkers at ports from Maine to Texas began walking picket lines early Tuesday in a strike over wages and automation that <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/longshoremen-strike-retailers-ports-holiday-d926e9cfb3f10efb50af89d3c96bdc3d">could reignite inflation and cause shortages</a></span> of goods if it goes on more than a few weeks.</p><p>The contract between the ports and about 45,000 members of the International Longshoremen’s Association expired at midnight, and even though progress was reported in talks on Monday, the workers went on strike. The strike affecting 36 ports is the first by the union since 1977. </p><p>Workers began picketing at the Port of Philadelphia shortly after midnight, walking in a circle at a rail crossing outside the port and chanting “No work without a fair contract.”</p><p>The union had message boards on the side of a truck reading: “Automation Hurts Families: ILA Stands For Job Protection.”</p><p>Local ILA president Boise Butler said workers want a fair contract that doesn’t allow automation of their jobs.</p>
    

<p>Shipping companies made billions during the pandemic by charging high prices, he said. “Now we want them to pay back. They’re going to pay back,” Butler said.</p><p>He said the union will strike for as long as it needs to get a fair deal, and it has leverage over the companies. </p>



<p>“This is not something that you start and you stop,” he said. “We’re not weak,” he added, pointing to the union’s importance to the nation’s economy</p><p>At Port Houston, at least 50 workers started picketing around midnight local time carrying signs saying “No Work Without a Fair Contract.” </p>
    
<p>The U.S. Maritime Alliance, which represents the ports, said Monday evening that both sides had moved off of their previous wage offers. But no deal was reached.</p><p>The union’s opening offer in the talks was for <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/longshoremen-strike-pay-automation-ports-jobs-consumers-3aa66e0a05db25a49645fad404a5f000">a 77% pay raise</a></span> over the six-year life of the contract, with President Harold Daggett saying it’s necessary to make up for inflation and years of small raises. ILA members make a base salary of about $81,000 per year, but some can pull in over $200,000 annually with large amounts of overtime.</p>
    

<p>But Monday evening, the alliance said it had increased its offer to 50% raises over six years, and it pledged to keep limits on automation in place from the old contract. The union wants a complete ban on automation. It wasn’t clear just how far apart both sides are.</p><p>“We are hopeful that this could allow us to fully resume collective bargaining around the other outstanding issues in an effort to reach an agreement,” the alliance statement said.</p><p>In a statement early Tuesday, the union said it rejected the alliance’s latest proposal because it “fell far short of what ILA rank-and-file members are demanding in wages and protections against automation.” The two sides had not held formal negotiations since June.</p><p>“We are prepared to fight as long as necessary, to stay out on strike for whatever period of time it takes, to get the wages and protections against automation our ILA members deserve,” Daggett said in the statement. “They must now meet our demands for this strike to end.”</p><p>The alliance said its offer tripled employer contributions to retirement plans and strengthened health care options.</p>
    

<p>Supply chain experts say consumers won’t see an immediate impact from the strike because most retailers stocked up on goods, moving ahead shipments of holiday gift items. </p><p>But if it goes more than a few weeks, a work stoppage would significantly snarl the nation’s supply chain, potentially leading to higher prices and delays in goods reaching households and businesses. </p><p>If drawn out, the strike will force businesses to pay shippers for delays and cause some goods to arrive late for peak holiday shopping season — potentially <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/longshoremen-strike-ports-pay-consumers-automation-october-77289c12bf3c3eff5e42cb6372126576">impacting delivery of anything</a></span> from toys or artificial Christmas trees to cars, coffee and fruit.</p><p>The strike will likely have an almost immediate impact on supplies of perishable imports like bananas, for example. The ports affected by the strike handle 3.8 million metric tons of bananas each year, or 75% of the nation’s supply, according to the American Farm Bureau Federation.</p><p>It also could snarl exports from East Coast ports and create traffic jams at ports on the West Coast, where workers are represented by a different union. Railroads say they can ramp up to carry more freight from the West Coast, but analysts say they can’t move enough to make up for the closed Eastern ports. </p>
    

<p>“If the strikes go ahead, they will cause enormous delays across the supply chain, a ripple effect which will no doubt roll into 2025 and cause chaos across the industry,” noted Jay Dhokia, founder of supply chain management and logistics firm Pro3PL. </p><p>J.P. Morgan estimated that a strike that shuts down East and Gulf coast ports could cost the economy $3.8 billion to $4.5 billion per day, with some of that recovered over time after normal operations resume.</p><p>The strike comes just weeks before the presidential election and could become a factor if there are shortages. Retailers, auto parts suppliers and produce importers had hoped for a settlement or that President Joe Biden would intervene and end the strike using the Taft-Hartley Act, which allows him to seek an 80-day cooling off period. </p>
    

<p>But during an exchange with reporters on Sunday, Biden, who has worked to court union votes for Democrats, said “no” when asked if he planned to intervene in the potential work stoppage.</p><p>A White House official said Monday that at Biden’s direction, the administration has been in regular communication with the ILA and the alliance to keep the negotiations moving forward. The president directed Chief of Staff Jeff Zients and National Economic Council Director Lael Brainard to convene the alliance’s board members Monday afternoon and urge them to resolve the dispute fairly and quickly — in a way that accounts for the success of shipping companies in recent years and contributions of union workers.</p><h2>___</h2><p>Krisher in reported from Detroit. Associated Press journalists Ben Finley in Norfolk, Virginia, Mae Anderson and Wyatte Grantham-Philips in New York, Dee-Ann Durbin in Detroit, Josh Boak in Washington, and Annie Mulligan in Houston contributed to this report.</p>

A few years back when the CTIA handover on regs happened (and sending costs went up) the carriers finally started to respond with the delivery status of the sent messages. Before this they didn't respond and you only knew your provider delivered the messages to the carrier, not whether the carrier delivered them to the handset.</p></div></td></tr>

The only network requests for the receiver are to Apple. Quoting from a January 2021 Project Zero blog post⁽¹⁾ on BlastDoor:</p><p><i>As an example, consider what happens when a user sends a link to a website over iMessage. In that case, the sending device will first render a preview of the webpage and collect some metadata about it (such as the title and page description), then pack those fields into an NSKeyedArchiver archive. This archive is then encrypted with a temporary key and uploaded to the iCloud servers. Finally, the link as well as the decryption key are sent to the receiver as part of the iMessage. In order to create a useful user notification about the incoming iMessage, this data has to be processed by the receiver on a 0-click code path. As that again involves a fair amount of complexity, it is also done inside BlastDoor: after receiving the BlastDoor reply from above and realizing that the message contains an attachment, imagent first instructs IMTransferAgent to download and decrypt the iCloud attachment.</i></p><p>⁽¹⁾ <a href="https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2021/01/a-look-at-imessage-in-ios-14.html" rel="nofollow">https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2021/01/a-look-at-ime...</a></p></div></td></tr>

There's plenty of legal entities that still will call you. If you answer, be polite, play the dope a bit to get the necessary unfortunately, ask how they got the number, then request a manager (yes, they have one, they will tell you they don't. Be polite but insist). When you get the manager politely ask for the company details, then tell them to immediately remove you from their list. Their business can be shut down for violations so once they know you know, they take you seriously (FCC takes reports more seriously when more detailed). They'll probably hang up on you, this is okay. Report them anyways (do this legal or not. They can get their voip removed and whatever shell they're using. It's still annoying for them and they might remove you because you're not worth it)</p><p>Second, don't answer phone calls. It is a practice to call, listen for a voice, then log that number as active.</p><p>Text messages are more difficult. It depends on the service but you can probably text stop. The difficulty of blocking is that legit services will use the same number to text you verification codes (can we fucking kill sms 2FA‽)</p><p>You can also sign up for a relay service (I use Firefox, but use whatever). I do this for email and every website has a unique email. Things like + for Gmail don't work and are filtered. You can also do this for phone numbers but it's more expensive.</p><p>Fourth, aggressively unsubscribe, report to FCC, change settings on devices, and so on. Do this for your non-tech savvy friends and family. Get them to use services like signal that are privacy preserving, don't leak metadata, AND is easy enough Grandma can use. Install ublock origin into their browsers and some other privacy preserving stuff and edit settings. Get them to use Firefox instead of Chrome if you can.</p><p>You need to do this to others because they will leak your information (most of my information leak comes from my parents. I even get emails in their names...)</p><p>If you want to take a step further, get a scrubbing service like optery. There's a lot of shady shit so be careful who you pick.</p><p>Edit: you can do a similar thing for mail. There is a $5 processing fee. Sucks, but sadly it's junk mail that keeps the post office alive (do not put "return to sender" unless it's prepaid. You need to give a reason otherwise your postal worker is just being nice and throwing it away for you. Don't create more work for them)</p><p><a href="https://consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-stop-junk-mail" rel="nofollow">https://consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-stop-junk-mail</a></p></div></td></tr>

It's locked to a single device with a single SIM. They can't be categorized, organized, tagged, forwarded, managed en masse, exported, or anything.

These are potentially seemingly commercial platforms for spammers. Note that Sinch owns Mailgun and Mailjet too and has a long documented history of legal trouble due to spamming. Businesses should avoid using these platforms because their own reputation and delivery will be affected by being mixed with spammers.</p></div></td></tr>

          <h2>Boris Vallejo and the Pixel Art of the Demoscene</h2>
          <p>
            As an epic fantasy painter, Boris Vallejo had a great influence on 1980s and 90s fantasy book covers, computer game box art, and the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene" target="_blank" rel="noopener">demoscene</a>. Through the decades, his works have been replicated by pixel artists. This article features fantasy art history, demoscene drama, and a lot of pixel art fun creating a Boris Vallejo imitation graphic using only four colors.

              recreation using only four colors. I call it "Wrath of the Vallerian" (after Boris Vallejo).

            Recently, I was going through the historical results of the <a href="https://www.demoparty.net/revision" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Revision</a> demoparty, as you do. I was looking
            for a subject to draw for a new pixel art piece. I had learned to appreciate the color limitations during
            the old-school graphics competition at <a href="https://www.demoparty.net/evoke" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Evoke</a>, where we could only use a predefined color palette. The
            first time I submitted an entry in 2022, I hated it. The second time, in 2023, I came to accept the
            limited color palette as a problem to solve. And by 2024, I actually started to enjoy the challenge.
          </p>
          <p>I wanted to create a new piece outside of competition and was looking for inspiration.</p>
          <p>
            In the
            <a href="https://2013.revision-party.net/history/2013.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">results.txt</a>
            file of Revision 2013, I found an interesting phrase. Right above the list of results for the graphics
            competition, it said:

          <h2 id="vallejo-01">Whatever Happened to Boris Vallejo?</h2>
          <p>
            I hadn't thought of Peruvian artist <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Vallejo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Boris Vallejo</a> in ages. I remembered his slick fantasy artwork,
            featuring idealistically rendered warriors and princesses, muscular and scantily clad (but not indecent).
            If they weren't battling monsters, the figures wouldn't look out of place in a romance novel. Vallejo's
            paintings were always beautifully done, but they're a bit out of fashion these days.
          </p>
          <p>

            <em> Boris Vallejo, "Dragon Riders", 1982 </em>
          </p>
          <p>
            Pixel artists copied his work in the late 1980s and 1990s. Vallejo's visual aesthetic was one that many
            <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene" target="_blank" rel="noopener">demoscene</a> groups sought to replicate or pay homage to on the new 16-bit platforms like the Commodore
            Amiga, the Atari ST, and the PC with its wonderful VGA graphics.

          </p>

          <p>
            Vallejo's art was filled with heroic characters, often set in mythical or alien worlds, similar to the
            themes explored in many demoscene productions. Demos in the 1990s, especially on platforms like the Amiga,
            frequently featured surreal landscapes, epic narratives, and fantastical characters reminiscent of
            Vallejo's paintings.
          </p>
          <p>
            There was a time when I loved Vallejo's art. It was a fascinating blend of imagination and breathtaking
            realism, with vivid portrayals of fantasy worlds populated by powerful, heroic figures and fantastical
            creatures. Vallejo's mastery of anatomy and attention to detail brought his subjects to life. I used to
            feel a true sense of awe and wonder when looking at his paintings. Back then, I felt that his work struck
            a balance between strength and beauty, craftsmanship and adventure.

          <p>
            These days, I'm not so sure. I've grown older, and my tastes have changed. I still admire Vallejo's work,
            but now I find it a bit too slick, idealized, and repetitive. I've come to appreciate rougher, more
            abstract, and more experimental art styles.
          </p>
          <p>
            I looked up Boris Vallejo, and by all accounts, he is in his 80s, alive and well. He collaborates with his artist wife <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julie_Bell" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Julie
            Bell</a>, continues to produce and successfully sell their artwork online:
            <a href="https://www.borisjulie.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">borisjulie.com</a>.</p>
          <p>Yet, while
            reminiscing about Vallejo's paintings, I realized I might have found a topic for a drawing.

            submitted by sceners on Demozoo are tagged with "boris-vallejo" though the tagging is probably not comprehensive. Given his significant influence on the demoscene,
            Boris Vallejo even has entries on both

            The other artist mentioned in the results.txt was the Japanese artist <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hajime_Sorayama" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hajime Sorayama</a>. He is best known
            for his hyper-realistic erotic robots and cyborgs. His work explores the fusion of man and machine, often
            focusing on eroticism, fetishism, and the beauty of artificial forms. Sorayama rose to international fame
            in the 1980s and has influenced various fields, from fine art to commercial design, including
            contributions to film, music, and fashion. For the young men in the demoscene, this was a perfect
            combination.

            Over the years, Boris Vallejo and his long-time collaborator Julie Bell had other intersections with
            computers in the 1990s. They painted box art for computer and video games such as the fantasy role-playing
            game <em>Dragon Wars</em>, the platform shooter <em>Turrican</em>, the side-scrolling fantasy beat-'em-up
            <em>Golden Axe</em>, and the delightful underwater adventure <em>Ecco the Dolphin</em>. Here is a

          <p>
            Vallejo's influence on sceners was unquestionable. Below are more examples of Vallejo's artwork used in
            demoscene productions. Many of these artworks were digitized or scanned, which doesn't require any
            artistry. It's a cheap and easy way to get good graphics for a demo.

              Turtletronic could pull off this scan or capture because their slideshow uses Amiga's HAM mode that

            Scanned paintings are quite controversial in the scene. In a blog post by a scener called <em>Danny</em>,
            who used to work for the computer game company Eidos Interactive, he does not like the practice of using scanned images of paintings and then declaring them as your own work. But he also does not find critics great who condemn sceners who copy paintings but delare that they are copies. He even
            wrote that it is the main reason he left the scene and would no longer submit any graphics for
            competitions. His post,
            <a href="http://www.kameli.net/nocopy/disint.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Disintegration Of The Old Graphics Scene</a>, is worth reading. He wrote it in 1998, making it a reflection of that time period in the demoscene.
          </p>

          <p>
            Some of <em>Danny's</em> arguments sound distressingly familiar nowadays in the context of AI-generated
            art. In his post, he wrote:
          </p>

          <p>
            <em>
              "There are quite a number of artists (even some famous ones that get much respect) that have practiced
              so long on making a scanned image look hand drawn, that their lame efforts have become almost
              undetectable. There is almost no way of telling if the image is created through blood, sweat, and tears,
              or the powers of modern-day technology.
            </em>
          </p>

<p><em>Danny</em> does not outright condemn or defend copying. He just does not fully discount its value in a hobbyist community like the demoscene as long as it is clear that a work is a reproduction of another work. This is for me the culmination of his text:</p>

<blockquote>
<em>
"My point is that everybody copies. Some do it to learn, others do it to grasp a bit of fame in a very challenging environment. It's not just the artists that copy, it's the whole bloody scene. And everyone that makes any form of art. Artists just get all the crap for it because it's easiest to spot."

            <em>The history of the Amiga demoscene is paved with Vallejo immitations.</em>
          </p>

          <p>
            Some graphics based on Vallejo paintings were actually pixel painted by the sceners, as can be seen in
            this article in
            <a href="https://www.editions64k.fr/product/demoscene-the-amiga-years-vol-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Demoscene: the Amiga Years. Volume 1 1984-1993</a>

            <em>The Éditions64K book features three pages about the process that Suny used to hand-pixel a recreation of a Vallejo painting on the Commodore Amiga.</em>
          </p>

<p>It is amazing how many demoscene pixel artists in the 1990s got their inspiration or motives from Boris Vallejo. <em>Suny</em> wrote in the Éditions64K book about the Amiga demoscene:</p>

<blockquote>
<em>
"My main influence was Boris Vallejo who seems to have inspired a lot of artists at the time. I then got interested in design, photography, painting and animation."
</em>
</blockquote>

<p>Then <em>Suny</em> went on to close out his section of the Éditions64K book with the following:</p>

<blockquote>
<em>
"With time, I realized I was not a real artist. I had rached a very good technical level and could reproduce an existing image perfectly. However, this is not the definition of an artist, and I am not super creative. This is why I became a Technical Artist in the video game industry, and now I am working at Apple."
</em>
</blockquote>

<p>This started out somewhat discouraging, but then we see that his meticulous reproductions of Vallejo’s work and other pixel art helped him find his strengths and discover new professional roles.</p>

            In a post on
            <a href="https://m.pouet.net/topic.php?which=9040&amp;page=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pouet.net</a>,
            user <em>friol</em> asked what the point of re-drawing paintings by others actually is. He even
            specifically refered to sceners who copy Boris Vallejo's work:
          </p>

          <blockquote>
            <em>
              "Oh well... I knew the demoscene was ripping Boris Vallejo, but not that much (we are talking of at
              least of one hundred pictures). But while some pictures are... I would call them "re-elaborations",
              others are 1-1 copies.<p>
              
              What's the point of that?"
            </p></em>
          </blockquote>

          <p>Another user, <em>gaspode</em> replied to <em>friol's</em> post:</p>

          <blockquote>
            <em>
              "That's the dark side of the scene, I think. I can not understand why obviously talented people copy
              pictures nearly 1:1. Even if they were re-drawn or re-pixeled or whatever, they are still copys for me
              (because the idea, colors and structure was stolen). Other people apparently don't have problems with
              that but for me everytime I discover such a thing my respect for the copying artist decreases and first
              of all I cannot enjoy their future artworks anymore, cause I always think they could have been copied."
            </em>
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            This opinion is well-supported by many sceners. User <em>ok3anos</em> pointed out that there is another
            side to copying artwork as long as the original artist gets credited:
          </p>

          <blockquote>
            <em>
              "Well, consider this: In painting, masters have always been copied by the apprentices to let them learn
              the basis techniques.<br>
              It does not disturb me at all to see pixel artists copying Boris Vallejo or others to increase their
              pixel technique as long as the original artist is credited in a way or another.<br>
              Would be more annoying if some of the works were just simple scans reworked a bit (which I suspect
              some...)</em>
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            <em>ok3anos</em> reply can be interpreted as a defense of copying artwork as long as the scener remains
            honest. A link can be found in this thread on pouet that points to the
            <a href="http://www.kameli.net/nocopy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">No-Copy site</a>. You can find a
            gallery of images created by sceners but copied from other artists. There are a lot of examples of swiped
            Vallejo art.
          </p>

          <p>
            <img src="https://marincomics.com/img/vallejo/no-copy.jpg" alt="A screenshot of the No Copy website showing how a scener copied Vallejo's painting of a merman and a mermaid copulating"><br>
            <em>The <a href="http://www.kameli.net/nocopy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">No-Copy</a> website. If we
              disregard for a moment that there are so many examples of swipes of Vallejo's merman and mermaid image,
              and look closely at this particular copy, then we can see that it looks like an actual painstaking
              recreation and not a scan (though this is only my personal feeling).</em>
          </p>

          <p>
            The first thing that strikes me, just looking at the swipes on the
            <a href="http://www.kameli.net/nocopy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">No-Copy</a> site, is how often
            Vallejo's painting of the merman and the mermaid was copied. I never wanted to know what it looks like
            when merpeople have sex. The second thing that strikes me is that many of the graphics definitely look
            like full scans or collages of partial scans.
          </p>

          <p>
            Yet, I think some of them are not scans but incredible reproductions. If my suspicion is true, I
            personally believe it takes a lot of craft to reproduce a painting as pixel art with the comparatively low
            resolution and limited color palette of a Commodore Amiga or a PC with VGA graphics. The most commonly
            used graphics mode for a regular Amiga was 320 x 256 with 32 colors (or 64 colors if extra halfbrite mode
            was used). The later AGA chipset in the Amiga 1200 and 4000 had a graphics mode comparable to the PC's VGA
            graphics. When the <a href="http://www.kameli.net/nocopy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">No-Copy</a> site
            was published in the second half of the 1990s, the most common VGA mode used for pixel graphics was 320 x
            200 with 256 colors, though some people used the higher resolution of 640 x 480, also with 256 colors. It
            takes patience and a lot of precision to copy Vallejo's art in a pixel paint program like
            <em>Deluxe Paint</em> or <em>Brilliance</em>.
          </p>

<p>My journey through Vallejo's influence on the demoscene brought me to the essay <a href="https://tarnkappe.info/jurassic-pack/an-original-picture-253480.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">An Original Picture</a> written in 2007 by <em>Lars <a href="https://demozoo.org/sceners/10963/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ghandy</a> Sobiraj</em>, the main editor of the longest running Amiga diskmag <a href="https://demozoo.org/productions/tagged/jurassic-pack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jurassic Pack</a>. He is very critical of pixel artists and graphicians who copy art or photos. He not only condemns scans but even folks who hand pixel their graphics based on someone else's paintings. He mentions a traditional, analog technique in which a grid is overlaid on both the original image and the drawing surface. This allows the copying artist to focus on replicating one small part at a time. This method ensured accurate proportions and alignment, helping the artist recreate the image in precise detail. However, he does not consider this technique to be high art.</p>

<p>Lars Sobiraj writes:</p>

<blockquote>
<em>
"The biggest shame with copied motives are the artists never telling others if it was copied or not. They just secretly hope not to be discovered by the scene police."
</em>
</blockquote>

<p>I actually support this statement. If you copy something, then make it clear that you are. This is the bile-filled finale of <em>Lars Sobiraj's</em> essay, like a curse upon copying artists (the spelling is unchanged from the original):</p>

<blockquote>
<em>
"Here is a last message from me: You took the express road for your success. But you are worthless peace of junk. No own fantasies, using grids, copying ideas. Damn lame. You will never develop yourself, and even if you get place #1 in the charts or by your scene friends, that is nothing compared to real life true graphicians based on the bigger world outside the scene.<p>
(b)lame yourself"
</p></em>
</blockquote>

<p>I understand the feeling of betrayal one might feel when confronted with artists who so obviously cheat. Yet I feel that this is also a bit too harsh.</p>

            All that being said, I don't think copying Vallejo's art is reprehensible as long as you credit the
            original artist and learn something from the recreation, perhaps by altering it enough to make it
            distinct.
          </p>

Criticizing other artists for copying the works of Boris Vallejo becomes somewhat ironic when we consider Vallejo's own creative process. Vallejo often uses models and bodybuilders as references, photographing them in specific poses, and then using these images as a foundation for his paintings. In this way, imitation plays a significant role even in his artistic method.</p>

<p>However, what distinguishes Vallejo is his remarkable ability to synthesize and transform these real-life references into something new and beautiful through his extraordinary skill with paint and brush. His artistry lies not just in copying but in elevating these references into highly imaginative and dynamic works, blending realism with fantasy. This process shows that while imitation may be part of art, true creativity comes from how those references are interpreted and reimagined.

          <p>
            I wanted to copy a Vallejo painting in my own style, using a super limited color palette. And, of course,
            I'd give credit to good ole Boris! But first, I need to wax poetic about the beauty of limited color
            palettes.
          </p>

            <img src="https://marincomics.com/img/vallejo/ochre-palette.jpg" alt="The four shades of ochre that I wanted to use for my recreation of a Vallejo painting"><br>
            <em>I chose to use only these four colors for my recreation of a Vallejo painting.</em>
          </p>

          <p>
            I used to paint pixel art on an Atari ST, which was limited to 16 colors on screen at the same time from a
            palette of 512 available shades. I always found this limiting and frustrating, especially considering that
            the Atari ST's main competitor, the Commodore Amiga, could display 32 and even 64 colors from 4,096
            available shades.
          </p>

          <p>
            Then, I started participating in graphics competitions at demoparties, using ridiculously limited six- to
            eight-color palettes. That's when I discovered an interesting challenge.
          </p>

          <p>
            There's something exciting about working within a limited color palette. I found that the constraints
            forced me to focus more on composition, shapes, and contrast. I had to make the most of the few colors I
            had.
          </p>

          <p>
            It might be unfair to call the limited color palette required for the Evoke graphics compo "old school"
            (or "old skool," if you're too cool for "school"). There are no restrictions on resolution, meaning I can
            use much higher resolutions than any retro "old school" machine was capable of. The results can look quite
            modern, and the style can be deliberately atmospheric due to the limited color palette.

          <h2 id="vallejo-05">Drawing A Vallejo in Line Art and Four Colors</h2>

          <p>
            So I decided to challenge myself by limiting a drawing to four colors. As a callback to the old days of
            the demoscene, I used a Boris Vallejo painting as my model. I chose Vallejo's "Gillkarth's Odyssey (The
            Axe Man)" from 1998. I used Procreate on my iPad Pro with the Apple Pencil. I absolutely adore Procreate.
            It is a phenomenally frictionless and intuitive painting tool.
          </p>

          <p>
            I ended up quite happy with my copy of it as line art. After a few dead ends in coloring, I was also
            pleased with how it turned out using only four colors.

            There was one odd thing I only realized while making the drawing: I have no idea what the barbarian fellow
            in the center is swinging his axe at. It might be that he's trying to chop into the snake, which is
            actually facing away from him and minding its own business. Or maybe he's attacking the viewer of the
            image. It could even be that he's being influenced by the two demon-like creatures behind him to attack.
            In the original image, his eyes are red, as though he's possessed. To this day, I don't know what this
            person is up to.
          </p>

          <p>
            I actually only learned that he's <em>not</em> Conan after I had started the drawing. I asked on the
            <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ConanTheBarbarian/comments/1fribzp/when_did_boris_vallejo_paint_this_picture_of/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Conan Reddit,</a>
            if anyone had more information about the painting, and I was quickly corrected. Reddit user <em>mattmirth</em> provided the real name of the paintin. And another user wrote: <em>"Every Boris Vallejo painting is Conan, he just doesn't know it. /s".</em> This comment got the most upvotes.
          </p>

          <p>
            I had a lot of fun drawing this piece. I learned a lot about working within color limitations and how to
            make the most of them. I also rekindled my appreciation for the art of Boris Vallejo. While I might not be
            a fan of his work anymore, I can see why he was so popular and influential. I understand why so many pixel
            artists copied his work.
