					<p>This page is here to teach you about <strong>block cipher cryptanalysis</strong>. It does not pretend to be an exhaustive list of attacks, but will give you enough to get started.</p>
					<p>The course is split in several sets, the first being on <strong>AES</strong>. We could have made up a simple block cipher, but it's more fun to attack the real thing don't you think?</p>
					<p>So head up to <a href="https://davidwong.fr/blockbreakers/aes.html"><img src="https://davidwong.fr/blockbreakers/images/AES/aes_icons-11.jpg">Set 1</a> and start by implementing <strong>AES</strong>.</p>

					<p>Don't worry, we're holding your hand ;)</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="article_text">
            <p>Satellogic is a satellite designer, manufacturer and constellation operator. They were founded in 2010 and have offices in Argentina, Uruguay, Spain and the US.</p>
<p>They launched three prototype Cube satellites between 2013 and 2014, using China and Russia as their launch partners.</p>
<p>In 2016, they began launching ~38 KG, 10K-component, 51 x 57 x 82-cm NewSat microsatellites. These take around three months to build and are meant to last for three years in orbit. They've named the constellation of these satellites "Aleph-1".</p>
<p>Below is a rendering of their NewSat satellite.</p>
<p><a href="https://tech.marksblogg.com/theme/images/satellogic/Aleph-1_internal_architecture.png"><img alt="Satellogic" src="https://tech.marksblogg.com/theme/images/satellogic/Aleph-1_internal_architecture.png"></a></p><p>They're aiming to have 300 satellites in orbit at some point which would provide revisit times up to every 5 minutes.</p>
<p>Last week, Satellogic announced an open satellite feed programme and named their dataset "Satellogic EarthView".</p>
<p>In this post, I'll examine Satellogic's constellation and open data feed.</p>
<div id="my-workstation">
<h2>My Workstation</h2>
<p>I'm using a 6 GHz Intel Core <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/236773/intel-core-i9-processor-14900k-36m-cache-up-to-6-00-ghz/specifications.html">i9-14900K</a> CPU. It has 8 performance cores and 16 efficiency cores with a total of 32 threads and 32 MB of L2 cache. It has a liquid cooler attached and is housed in a spacious, full-sized Cooler Master HAF 700 computer case. I've come across videos on YouTube where people have managed to overclock the i9-14900KF to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fb7pl7PZOYo">9.1 GHz</a>.</p>
<p>The system has 96 GB of DDR5 RAM clocked at 6,000 MT/s and a 5th-generation, Crucial T700 4 TB NVMe M.2 SSD which can read at speeds up to 12,400 MB/s. There is a heatsink on the SSD to help keep its temperature down. This is my system's C drive.</p>
<p>The system is powered by a 1,200-watt, fully modular Corsair Power Supply and is sat on an ASRock Z790 Pro RS Motherboard.</p>
<p>I'm running Ubuntu 22 LTS via Microsoft's Ubuntu for Windows on Windows 11 Pro. In case you're wondering why I don't run a Linux-based desktop as my primary work environment, I'm still using an Nvidia GTX 1080 GPU which has better driver support on Windows and I use ArcGIS Pro from time to time which only supports Windows natively.</p>

<p>The maps in this post were rendered with <a href="https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html">QGIS</a> version 3.42. QGIS is a desktop application that runs on Windows, macOS and Linux. The application has grown in popularity in recent years and has ~15M application launches from users all around the world each month.</p>
<p>I used QGIS' <a href="https://github.com/marklit/tile_plus">Tile+ plugin</a> to add geospatial context with Bing's Virtual Earth Basemap to the maps. The dark, non-satellite imagery maps are mostly made up of vector data from Natural Earth and Overture.</p>

<div id="aleph-1-s-launch-history">
<h2>Aleph-1's Launch History</h2>
<p>Satellogic has launched 41 satellites for its Aleph-1 constellation as of January 14, 2025.</p>
<p>Their first seven satellites were launched by China between May 2016 and September 2020.</p>
<p>Their eighth satellite was launched by ESA from the Spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana in September 2020.</p>
<p>China then launched 10 satellites of theirs in one mission in November 2020.</p>
<p>Since June 2021, SpaceX have launched 23 of their satellites with the most recent  being on January 14th, 2025.</p>
</div>
<div id="active-satellites">
<h2>Active Satellites</h2>
<p>Below I've tried to find all of their active satellites' locations. The positions of their satellites should change each time the following script is executed.</p>
<p>I couldn't find an official listing of their satellites <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-line_element_set">Two-line elements</a> (TLEs) but I found a listing of NORAD IDs. I scraped the n2yo listings for each satellite and parsed the name and TLE for each of those results.</p>

<p>The above produced names and TLEs for 22 of their satellites. I'm not sure if the above is an accurate reflection of their constellation's status or not so please don't treat this as gospel.</p>

<p>Each image has geospatial information embedded within it, so I can group them together into a single image that will retain the spatial data. I'll re-compress the image using WebP, so the resulting image is much smaller than the original source imagery.</p>

<ul>
<li>L0: Raw</li>
<li>L1A: Raw corrected</li>
<li>L1B: L1 Basic (Cloud, shadow and usable data mask)</li>
<li>L1C: Ortho ready</li>
<li>L1D/L1D_SR: Ortho</li>
<li>L1: TOA Reflectance</li>
<li>L1_SR: TOA Reflectance SuperResolution</li>
</ul>
<p>The product listed in the metadata for these images was L1 which I'm assuming means "Radiometric-corrected imagery (TOA reflectance imagery)". Their product documentation says the imagery is corrected for sensor, optical and terrain distortions (orthorectified).</p>
<p>My best guess is that the images have been processed independently of one another. Basemap producers often strive to blend images next to one another seamlessly but that might not be a requirement for this imagery's original deliverable.</p>

She’s submitted a workers’ compensation complaint.

            Some federal workers being told to return to the office have no space to return to. At least two office buildings used by the Interior Department in the Western US were told last week their leases had been canceled, according to a source familiar with the matter — while a third office housing hundreds of people was notified its lease will be up in June.

            President <a href="https://www.cnn.com/politics/president-donald-trump-47">Donald Trump</a> has repeatedly demanded all federal workers return to the office as his administration has undertaken sweeping actions seeking to drastically reduce the size of the federal workforce, including mass firings of probationary workers and employees in government diversity departments.

            Trump’s in-office mandate has been coupled with a push to slash government real estate, setting up a dilemma of too little space for too many people. Even before Trump took office in January, the federal government was downsizing office space due in part to the shift toward telework during the pandemic.

            Nearly half of the more than 2.3 million civilian federal workers were eligible for telework, and 10% were in remote positions with no expectation of in-person work, according to a 2024 Office of Management and Budget report.<strong> </strong>Many workers stopped working full time in their offices during the Covid-19 pandemic, but others had long-held arrangements for working from home<strong> </strong>— and now could face the prospect of choosing between fundamentally changing their job or leaving it altogether.

            Some government employees are now making the post-pandemic transition that millions of private-sector workers already have — upending their lives and schedules in the process.

But there have been pockets of pushback, such as the employee union at the Environmental Protection Agency, which is demanding to bargain around the return-to-office mandate. Additionally, some individual EPA employees represented by the union are filing grievances around returning to the office.

            The return-to-office mandate comes as budget cuts at EPA led to reduced cleaning and facility services at key offices, even before the Trump administration took over.

            In the three major EPA offices around the country that make up the agency’s headquarters — Washington, Cincinnati and Research Triangle Park, North Carolina — health units were closed and in-office mail delivery was cut back, according to a memo obtained by CNN. In Cincinnati, drinking fountain cleaning schedules were reduced to once per week, carpets and hallways were swept once a month, and bathroom cleanings were pared back to once a day.

            “With these people coming back to the offices, they’re going to have fewer facility services,” the EPA union official said.

            The 2024 OMB report found those eligible for telework spend about 60% of their working hours in the office, on average, though that figure varies widely by agency. About 10% of staffers have remote jobs, where they are not expected to report to an office at all, according to the report, which noted the Biden administration also directed agencies to increase the amount of time federal workers spent at the office.
    </p>

            The Biden administration’s goal was for teleworkers to spend at least 50% of the time in the office. Now Trump turned that into a full-time mandate.

            But not all federal workers are returning at the same pace, as Trump’s executive order, issued hours after he took office in January, directed agencies to terminate remote work arrangements “as soon as practicable.”
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7thvok4001k3b6movkqhmp4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            Several agencies, including the departments of Veterans Affairs and Health and Human Services, have said political appointees, senior executives and other senior staffers could no longer work remotely or telework as of February 24, and neither could supervisors who live within 50 miles of an agency facility.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7thvok4001l3b6mqhwzi9zp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            Others have more time. For instance, at the VA, lower-level non-union employees who live within 50 miles of a facility will have their remote and telework arrangements terminated by April 28, except for ad hoc or situational circumstances, the agency said. But these arrangements for supervisors and other non-union employees who reside farther away were not ended — those staffers will receive additional guidance.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7thvok4001m3b6mcycmncdy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            As for union workers at the VA, their return-to-office date will be announced at a later time, the agency said.

            At the Department of Education, more than 70% of its workforce started reporting to the Washington and regional offices full time last week, the agency said in a news release. The rest are expected back by June 1 after building renovations and relocation arrangements are complete.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7thvok4001n3b6maetty1jv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            However, many union members at the Department of Housing and Urban Development who were previously able to telework on certain days had to return to the office full time in late February, said Antonio Gaines, president of the AFGE Council 222, which represents 5,300 employees at the agency. Workers at some regional and field offices are exempt for now because of lack of space and safety concerns, including building renovations and inadequate HVAC systems.

            The mandate violates the union’s collective bargaining agreement, he argued.

            “They made a unilateral decision to bypass the negotiating process,” Gaines said of the agency, adding that the union plans to file a complaint on this matter as part of a bigger grievance package.

                    </p>

                        <p>Italy's Council of Ministers has approved a draft law calling for the government to adopt a series of legislative decrees to create the legal framework for the reintroduction of nuclear power, which was phased out following a referendum in 1987.</p>

                <p>On 28 February, on the proposal of President Giorgia Meloni and the Minister of the Environment and Energy Security Gilberto Pichetto Fratin, the Council of Ministers (the Italian cabinet) approved the draft delegation law on 'sustainable nuclear energy'.</p>

<p>The government said the text is aimed at "the inclusion of sustainable nuclear and fusion in the so-called 'Italian energy mix' and intervenes organically from an economic, social and environmental perspective, within the framework of European decarbonisation policies with a time horizon of 2050, consistently with the objectives of carbon neutrality and security of supply".</p>

<p>It added that the intervention aims to: ensure continuity of energy supply in the presence of a constant increase in demand and promote the achievement of energy independence; contribute to the decarbonisation objectives necessary to tackle climate change; and ensure the sustainability of costs borne by end users and the competitiveness of the national industrial system.</p>

<p>The draft law says that Italy should make "a clear break ... with respect to the nuclear plants of the past" and "use of the best available technologies, including modular and advanced technologies". It calls for the government to establish an independent authority for the regulation, supervision and control of nuclear infrastructures.</p>

<p>"Promoters of nuclear projects must provide adequate financial and legal guarantees to cover the costs of construction, operation and decommissioning of the plants and for risks, even those not directly attributable to them, arising from nuclear activity," it adds.</p>

<p>The draft law requires the government to adopt a series of legislative decrees, within 12 months of entry into force, to "organically regulate the entire life cycle of the new sustainable energy, through the drafting of a national programme: from the testing, localisation, construction and operation of the new reactors, to the issue of manufacturing and reprocessing of the fuel will be addressed in a circular economy vision". It will also "serve to provide training and information tools, train new technicians and professionals in the sector, and identify benefits for the territories involved".</p>

<p>The draft law will now be submitted to parliament for final approval.</p>

<p>"With the latest generation nuclear, together with renewables, we will be able to achieve the objectives of decarbonisation, guaranteeing the full energy security of the country," Minister Pichetto Fratin said. "In this way, Italy is ready to face the challenges of the future."</p>

<h4><span>The background</span><br>
&nbsp;</h4>

<p>Italy operated a total of four nuclear power plants starting in the early 1960s but decided to phase out nuclear power in a referendum that followed the 1986 Chernobyl accident. It closed its last two operating plants, Caorso and Trino Vercellese, in 1990.</p>

<p>In late March 2011, following the Fukushima Daiichi accident, the Italian government approved a moratorium of at least one year on construction of nuclear power plants in the country, which had been looking to restart its long-abandoned nuclear programme.</p>

<p>The public mood has changed since then, and in May 2023, the Italian Parliament approved a motion to urge the government to consider incorporating nuclear power into the country's energy mix. In September last year, the first meeting was held of the National Platform for a Sustainable Nuclear, set up by the government to define a time frame for the possible resumption of nuclear energy in Italy and identify opportunities for the country's industrial chain already operating in the sector.</p>

<p>Italy's government included potential nuclear capacity - up to 16 GW/20-22% of capacity by 2050 - in its National Integrated Energy and Climate Plan, which was submitted to the European Commission on 1 July 2024.</p>

<p>Speaking the following day at the <em>Global Energy Transition Congress in Milan</em>, Pichetto Fratin, said: "We expect to be able to reach about 8 GW from nuclear power by 2050, covering more than 10% of the nation's electricity demand. This percentage may increase to over 20-22% by fully exploiting the potential of nuclear power in our country."</p>

<p>The Trump administration has informed NOAA that two pivotal centers for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/03/02/major-storm-severe-outbreak-weather-service-layoffs">weather forecasting</a>will soon have their leases canceled, sources told Axios.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Why it matters:&nbsp;</strong>One of the buildings is the nerve center for generating national weather forecasts.&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>It was designed to integrate multiple forecasting centers in one building to improve operating efficiency. It houses telecommunications equipment to send weather data and forecasts across the U.S. and abroad.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Driving the news:&nbsp;</strong>The NOAA Center for Weather and Climate Prediction is on the lease cancellation list, according to a NOAA employee who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution.&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>Two ex-National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration officials also confirmed the list.</li>



<li>The building houses the National Weather Service’s National Centers for Environmental Prediction, or NCEP, which includes the Environmental Modeling Center. It&nbsp;<a href="https://www.weather.gov/media/wrn/1pgr_NCWCP.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">opened in 2012</a>and has about 268,000 square feet of space.</li>



<li>The modeling center runs the computer models used in day-to-day weather forecasting, and ensures that weather data correctly goes into these models and that they are operating correctly.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>The lease cancellation</strong>&nbsp;was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/622990/trump-doge-government-layoffs-doge-weather-forecasts-noaa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first reported by The Verge</a>. The National Weather Service didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>



<ul>
<li>The NOAA employee told Axios the cancellations — along with recent layoffs, early retirements, and travel and hiring limitations — point to an effort to dismantle the agency.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Between the lines:&nbsp;</strong>Elon Musk’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.axios.com/politics-policy/doge-department-of-government-efficiency">Department of Government Efficiency</a>&nbsp;(DOGE) has been working through the General Services Administration to cancel government leases of office space.</p>



<ul>
<li>The NOAA employee told Axios a nightmare scenario could unfold if the College Park building was shuttered, but the agency still was tasked with the same missions as at present.</li>



<li>In that case, NOAA would have to somehow replicate its functionality somewhere else in a process that could take a year or more and leave critical forecasting gaps.</li>



<li>It would also require new congressional appropriations to get that done.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>The intrigue:&nbsp;</strong>The cancellation notice for the College Park facility isn’t final, as a spreadsheet detailing all the properties on the cancellation list has an end date of “TBD” for that building, according to the NOAA staff member.</p>

  <article>
    <p>Writing your own TCP/IP stack may seem like a daunting task. Indeed, TCP has accumulated many specifications over its lifetime of more than thirty years. The core specification, however, is seemingly compact<sup id="fnref:tcp-roadmap" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:tcp-roadmap">1</a></sup> - the important parts being TCP header parsing, the state machine, congestion control and retransmission timeout computation.</p>

<p>The most common layer 2 and layer 3 protocols, Ethernet and IP respectively, pale in comparison to TCP’s complexity. In this blog series, we will implement a minimal userspace TCP/IP stack for Linux.</p>

<p>The purpose of these posts and the resulting software is purely educational - to learn network and system programming at a deeper level.</p>

<h2 id="tuntap-devices">TUN/TAP devices</h2>

<p>To intercept low-level network traffic from the Linux kernel, we will use a Linux TAP device. In short, a TUN/TAP device is often used by networking userspace applications to manipulate L3/L2 traffic, respectively. A popular example is <a href="https://www.saminiir.com/openvpn-puts-packets-inside-your-packets/#tunneling">tunneling</a>, where a packet is wrapped inside the payload of another packet.</p>

<p>The advantage of TUN/TAP devices is that they’re easy to set up in a userspace program and they are already being used in a multitude of programs, such as <a href="https://www.saminiir.com/openvpn-puts-packets-inside-your-packets/">OpenVPN</a>.</p>

<p>As we want to build the networking stack from the layer 2 up, we need a TAP device. We instantiate it like so:</p>

<p>After this, the returned file descriptor <code>fd</code> can be used to <code>read</code> and <code>write</code> data to the virtual device’s ethernet buffer.</p>

<p>The flag <code>IFF_NO_PI</code> is crucial here, otherwise we end up with unnecessary packet information prepended to the Ethernet frame. You can actually take a look at the kernel’s <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v4.4/drivers/net/tun.c#L1306">source code</a> of the tun-device driver and verify this yourself.</p>

<h2 id="ethernet-frame-format">Ethernet Frame Format</h2>

<p>The multitude of different Ethernet networking technologies are the backbone of connecting computers in <em>Local Area Networks</em> (LANs). As with all physical technology, the Ethernet standard has greatly evolved from its first version<sup id="fnref:ethernet" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:ethernet">2</a></sup>, published by Digital Equipment Corporation, Intel and Xerox in 1980.</p>

<p>The first version of Ethernet was slow in today’s standards - about 10Mb/s and it utilized half-duplex communication, meaning that you either sent or received data, but not at the same time. This is why a <em>Media Access Control</em> (MAC) protocol had to be incorporated to organize the data flow. Even to this day, <em>Carrier Sense, Multiple Access with Collision Detection</em> (CSMA/CD) is required as the MAC method if running an Ethernet interface in half-duplex mode.</p>

<p>The invention of the <em>100BASE-T</em> Ethernet standard used twisted-pair wiring to enable full-duplex communication and higher throughput speeds. Additionally, the simultaneous increase in popularity of Ethernet switches made CSMA/CD largely obsolete.</p>

<p>The different Ethernet standards are maintained by the IEEE 802.3<sup id="fnref:ieee-802-3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:ieee-802-3">3</a></sup> working group.</p>

<p>Next, we’ll take a look at the Ethernet Frame header. It can be declared as a C struct followingly:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>#include &lt;linux/if_ether.h&gt;
</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>eth_hdr</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>unsigned</span> <span>char</span> <span>dmac</span><span>[</span><span>6</span><span>];</span>
    <span>unsigned</span> <span>char</span> <span>smac</span><span>[</span><span>6</span><span>];</span>
    <span>uint16_t</span> <span>ethertype</span><span>;</span>
    <span>unsigned</span> <span>char</span> <span>payload</span><span>[];</span>
<span>}</span> <span>__attribute__</span><span>((</span><span>packed</span><span>));</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The <code>dmac</code> and <code>smac</code> are pretty self-explanatory fields. They contain the MAC addresses of the communicating parties (destination and source, respectively).</p>

<p>The overloaded field, <code>ethertype</code>, is a 2-octet field, that depending on its value, either indicates the length or the type of the payload. Specifically, if the field’s value is greater or equal to 1536, the field contains the type of the payload (e.g. IPv4, ARP). If the value is less than that, it contains the length of the payload.</p>

<p>After the type field, there is a possibility of several different <em>tags</em> for the Ethernet frame. These tags can be used to describe the <em>Virtual LAN</em> (VLAN) or the <em>Quality of Service</em> (QoS) type of the frame. Ethernet frame tags are excluded from our implementation, so the corresponding field also does not show up in our protocol declaration.</p>

<p>The field <code>payload</code> contains a pointer to the Ethernet frame’s payload. In our case, this will contain an ARP or IPv4 packet. If the payload length is smaller than the minimum required 48 bytes (without tags), pad bytes are appended to the end of the payload to meet the requirement.</p>

<p>We also include the <code>if_ether.h</code> Linux header to provide a mapping between ethertypes and their hexadecimal values.</p>

<p>Lastly, the Ethernet Frame Format also includes the <em>Frame Check Sequence</em> field in the end, which is used with <em>Cyclic Redundancy Check</em> (CRC) to check the integrity of the frame. We will omit the handling of this field in our implementation.</p>

<h2 id="ethernet-frame-parsing">Ethernet Frame Parsing</h2>

<p>The attribute <em>packed</em> in a struct’s declaration is an implementation detail - It is used to instruct the GNU C compiler not to optimize the struct memory layout for data alignment with padding bytes<sup id="fnref:gnu-c-packed" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:gnu-c-packed">4</a></sup>. The use of this attribute stems purely out of the way we are “parsing” the protocol buffer, which is just a type cast over the data buffer with the proper protocol struct:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>struct</span> <span>eth_hdr</span> <span>*</span><span>hdr</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>struct</span> <span>eth_hdr</span> <span>*</span><span>)</span> <span>buf</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>A portable, albeit slightly more laborious approach, would be to serialize the protocol data manually. This way, the compiler is free to add padding bytes to conform better to different processor’s data alignment requirements.</p>

<p>The overall scenario for parsing and handling incoming Ethernet frames is straightforward:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>tun_read</span><span>(</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>BUFLEN</span><span>)</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>print_error</span><span>(</span><span>"ERR: Read from tun_fd: %s</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>strerror</span><span>(</span><span>errno</span><span>));</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>struct</span> <span>eth_hdr</span> <span>*</span><span>hdr</span> <span>=</span> <span>init_eth_hdr</span><span>(</span><span>buf</span><span>);</span>

<span>handle_frame</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>netdev</span><span>,</span> <span>hdr</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The <code>handle_frame</code> function just looks at the <code>ethertype</code> field of the Ethernet header, and decides its next action based upon the value.</p>

<h2 id="address-resolution-protocol">Address Resolution Protocol</h2>

<p>The <em>Address Resolution Protocol</em> (ARP) is used for dynamically mapping a 48-bit Ethernet address (MAC address) to a protocol address (e.g. IPv4 address). The key here is that with ARP, multitude of different L3 protocols can be used: Not just IPv4, but other protocols like CHAOS, which declares 16-bit protocol addresses.</p>

<p>The usual case is that you know the IP address of some service in your LAN, but to establish actual communications, also the hardware address (MAC) needs to be known. Hence, ARP is used to broadcast and query the network, asking the owner of the IP address to report its hardware address.</p>

<p>The ARP packet format is relatively straightforward:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>struct</span> <span>arp_hdr</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>uint16_t</span> <span>hwtype</span><span>;</span>
    <span>uint16_t</span> <span>protype</span><span>;</span>
    <span>unsigned</span> <span>char</span> <span>hwsize</span><span>;</span>
    <span>unsigned</span> <span>char</span> <span>prosize</span><span>;</span>
    <span>uint16_t</span> <span>opcode</span><span>;</span>
    <span>unsigned</span> <span>char</span> <span>data</span><span>[];</span>
<span>}</span> <span>__attribute__</span><span>((</span><span>packed</span><span>));</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The ARP header (<code>arp_hdr</code>) contains the 2-octet <code>hwtype</code>, which determines the link layer type used. This is Ethernet in our case, and the actual value is <code>0x0001</code>.</p>

<p>The 2-octet <code>protype</code> field indicates the protocol type. In our case, this is IPv4, which is communicated with the value <code>0x0800</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>hwsize</code> and <code>prosize</code> fields are both 1-octet in size, and they contain the sizes of the hardware and protocol fields, respectively. In our case, these would be 6 bytes for MAC addresses, and 4 bytes for IP addresses.</p>

<p>The 2-octet field <code>opcode</code> declares the type of the ARP message. It can be ARP request (1), ARP reply (2), RARP request (3) or RARP reply (4).</p>

<p>The <code>data</code> field contains the actual payload of the ARP message, and in our case, this will contain IPv4 specific information:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>struct</span> <span>arp_ipv4</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>unsigned</span> <span>char</span> <span>smac</span><span>[</span><span>6</span><span>];</span>
    <span>uint32_t</span> <span>sip</span><span>;</span>
    <span>unsigned</span> <span>char</span> <span>dmac</span><span>[</span><span>6</span><span>];</span>
    <span>uint32_t</span> <span>dip</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span> <span>__attribute__</span><span>((</span><span>packed</span><span>));</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The fields are pretty self explanatory. <code>smac</code> and <code>dmac</code> contain the 6-byte MAC addresses of the sender and receiver, respectively. <code>sip</code> and <code>dip</code> contain the sender’s and receiver’s IP addresses, respectively.</p>

<h2 id="address-resolution-algorithm">Address Resolution Algorithm</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc826">original specification</a> depicts this simple algorithm for address resolution:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash">?Do I have the hardware <span>type </span><span>in </span>ar<span>$hrd</span>?
Yes: <span>(</span>almost definitely<span>)</span>
  <span>[</span>optionally check the hardware length ar<span>$hln</span><span>]</span>
  ?Do I speak the protocol <span>in </span>ar<span>$pro</span>?
  Yes:
    <span>[</span>optionally check the protocol length ar<span>$pln</span><span>]</span>
    Merge_flag :<span>=</span> <span>false
    </span>If the pair &lt;protocol <span>type</span>, sender protocol address&gt; is
        already <span>in </span>my translation table, update the sender
        hardware address field of the entry with the new
        information <span>in </span>the packet and <span>set </span>Merge_flag to true.
    ?Am I the target protocol address?
    Yes:
      If Merge_flag is <span>false</span>, add the triplet &lt;protocol <span>type</span>,
          sender protocol address, sender hardware address&gt; to
          the translation table.
      ?Is the opcode ares_op<span>$REQUEST</span>?  <span>(</span>NOW look at the opcode!!<span>)</span>
      Yes:
        Swap hardware and protocol fields, putting the <span>local
            </span>hardware and protocol addresses <span>in </span>the sender fields.
        Set the ar<span>$op</span> field to ares_op<span>$REPLY</span>
        Send the packet to the <span>(</span>new<span>)</span> target hardware address on
            the same hardware on which the request was received.</code></pre></figure>

<p>Namely, the <code>translation table</code> is used to store the results of ARP, so that hosts can just look up whether they already have the entry in their cache. This avoids spamming the network for redundant ARP requests.</p>

<p>The algorithm is implemented in <a href="https://github.com/saminiir/level-ip/blob/e9ceb08f01a5499b85f03e2d615309c655b97e8f/src/arp.c#L53">arp.c</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, the ultimate test for an ARP implementation is to see whether it replies to ARP requests correctly:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>[</span>saminiir@localhost lvl-ip]<span>$ </span>arping <span>-I</span> tap0 10.0.0.4
ARPING 10.0.0.4 from 192.168.1.32 tap0

Unicast reply from 10.0.0.4 <span>[</span>00:0C:29:6D:50:25]  13.309ms

<span>[</span>saminiir@localhost lvl-ip]<span>$ </span>arp
Address                  HWtype  HWaddress           Flags Mask            Iface
10.0.0.4                 ether   00:0c:29:6d:50:25   C                     tap0</code></pre></figure>

<p>The kernel’s networking stack recognized the ARP reply from our custom networking stack, and consequently populated its ARP cache with the entry of our virtual network device. Success!</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>The minimal implementation of Ethernet Frame handling and ARP is relatively easy and can be done in a few lines of code. On the contrary, the reward-factor is quite high, since you get to populate a Linux host’s ARP cache with your own make-belief Ethernet device!</p>

<p>The source code for the project can be found at <a href="https://github.com/saminiir/level-ip">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>In the next post, we’ll continue the implementation with ICMP echo &amp; reply (ping) and IPv4 packet parsing.</p>

Second, we'll dive into the repository itself, exploring their smart approach to enabling DuckDB as a distributed system, along with its limitations and open questions.</p><p><span>I assume you're familiar with DuckDB. I've created </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIYcNkSjh-0wlrFUE2VvQilLU2aBPns0K" rel="">tons of content around it</a><span>. But just in case, here's a high-level recap.</span></p><blockquote><p><span>For transparency, at the time of writing this blog, I’m a data engineer and DevRel at </span><a href="https://motherduck.com/" rel="">MotherDuck</a><span>. MotherDuck provides a cloud-based version of DuckDB with enhanced features. Its approach differs from what we’ll discuss here, and while I’ll do my best to remain objective, just a heads-up! 🙂</span></p></blockquote><p>DuckDB is an in-process analytical database, meaning it runs within your application without requiring a separate server. You can install it easily in multiple programming languages by adding a library—think of it as the SQLite of analytics, but built for high-performance querying on large datasets.</p><p>It's built in C++ and contains all the integrations you might need for your data pipelines (AWS S3/Google Cloud Storage, Parquet, Iceberg, spatial data, etc.), and it's damn fast. Besides working with common file formats, it has its own efficient storage format—a single ACID-compliant file containing all tables and metadata, with strong compression.</p><p>In Python, getting started is as simple as:</p><pre><code><code>pip install duckdb</code></code></pre><p>Then, load and query a Parquet file in just a few lines:</p><pre><code><code>import duckdb
conn = duckdb.connect()
conn.sql("SELECT * FROM '/path/to/file.parquet'")</code></code></pre><p><span>It also supports reading and writing to </span><a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/index.html" rel="">Pandas</a><span> and </span><a href="https://pola.rs/" rel="">Polars</a><span> DataFrames with zero copy, thanks to Arrow.</span></p><pre><code><code>import duckdb
import pandas

# Create a Pandas dataframe
my_df = pandas.DataFrame.from_dict({'a': [42]})

# query the Pandas DataFrame "my_df"
# Note: duckdb.sql connects to the default in-memory database connection
results = duckdb.sql("SELECT * FROM my_df").df()</code></code></pre><p>We talk a lot about LLM frameworks, models, and agents, but we often forget that the first step in ANY AI project comes down to data.</p><p>Whether it's for training, RAG, or other applications, it all comes down to feeding systems with good, clean data. But how do we even accomplish that step? Through data engineering. Data engineering is a crucial step in AI workflows but is less discussed because it's less "sexy" and less "new."</p><p><span>Regarding DuckDB, we've already seen other AI companies like </span><a href="https://huggingface.co/" rel="">HuggingFace</a><span> using it behind the scenes to quickly serve and explore their datasets library through their </span><a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/datasets-viewer" rel="">dataset viewer.</a></p><p><span>Now, DeepSeek is introducing </span><em>smallpond</em><span>, a lightweight open-source framework, leveraging DuckDB to process terabyte-scale datasets in a distributed manner. Their benchmark states: _“Sorted 110.5TiB of data in 30 minutes and 14 seconds, achieving an average throughput of 3.66TiB/min.” </span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank"

What's the catch here?</p><p>Let's dive in.</p><p><span>smallpond follows a </span><strong>lazy evaluation</strong><span> approach when performing operations on DataFrames (</span><code>map()</code><span>, </span><code>filter()</code><span>, </span><code>partial_sql()</code><span>, etc.), meaning it doesn’t execute them immediately. Instead, it constructs a </span><strong>logical plan</strong><span> represented as a </span><strong>directed acyclic graph (DAG)</strong><span>, where each operation corresponds to a node in the graph (e.g., </span><code>SqlEngineNode</code><span>, </span><code>HashPartitionNode</code><span>, </span><code>DataSourceNode</code><span>).</span></p><p>Execution is only triggered when an action is called, such as:</p><ul><li><p><code>write_parquet()</code><span> – Write data to disk</span></p></li><li><p><code>to_pandas()</code><span> – Convert to a pandas DataFrame</span></p></li><li><p><code>compute()</code><span> – Explicitly request computation</span></p></li><li><p><code>count()</code><span> – Count rows</span></p></li><li><p><code>take()</code><span> – Retrieve rows</span></p></li></ul><p>This approach optimizes performance by deferring computation until necessary, reducing redundant operations and improving efficiency.</p><p><span>When execution is triggered, the logical plan is converted into an execution plan. The execution plan consists of tasks (e.g., </span><code>SqlEngineTask</code><span>, </span><code>HashPartitionTask</code><span>) that correspond to the nodes in the logical plan. These tasks are the actual units of work that will be distributed and executed through </span><a href="https://ray.io/" rel="">Ray</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>The important thing to understand is that the distribution mechanism in smallpond operates at the Python level with help from </span><a href="https://www.ray.io/" rel="">Ray</a><span>, specifically </span><a href="https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-core/walkthrough.html" rel="">Ray Core</a><span>, through partitions.</span></p><p>A given operation is distributed based on manual partitioning provided by the user. Smallpond supports multiple partitioning strategies:</p><ul><li><p>Hash partitioning (by column values)</p></li><li><p>Even partitioning (by files or rows)</p></li><li><p>Random shuffle partitioning</p></li></ul><p><span>For each partition, a separate DuckDB instance is created within a Ray </span><a href="https://github.com/deepseek-ai/smallpond/blob/ed112db42af4d006a80861d1305a1c22cabdd359/smallpond/execution/task.py#L4" rel="">task</a><span>. Each task processes its assigned partition independently using SQL queries through DuckDB.</span></p><p><span>Given this architecture, you might notice that the framework is tightly integrated with Ray, which comes with a trade-off: it prioritizes </span><strong>scaling out</strong><span> (adding more nodes with standard hardware) over </span><strong>scaling up</strong><span> (improving the performance of a single node).</span></p><p><span>Therefore, you would need to have a Ray cluster. Multiple options exist, but you would have more options today to manage your own cluster through AWS/GCP compute or a Kubernetes cluster. Only </span><a href="https://www.anyscale.com/" rel="">Anyscale</a><span>, the company founded and led by the creators of Ray, offers a fully managed Ray service. Even then, you have the overhead of monitoring a cluster.</span></p><p><span>The great thing here is that the developer experience is nice because you get a local single node when working and only scale when you need to. But the question is: do you actually need to scale out and add the cluster overhead given that the largest machine on </span><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/high-memory/" rel="">AWS today provides 24TB of memory</a><span>?</span></p><p>Ray Core is just for compute - where does the storage live?</p><p><span>While smallpond supports local filesystems for development and smaller workloads, the benchmark on 100TB mentioned is actually using the custom DeepSeek </span><a href="https://github.com/deepseek-ai/3FS" rel="">3FS framework</a><span>: Fire-Flyer File System is a high-performance distributed file system designed to address the challenges of AI training and inference workloads.</span></p><p><span>To put it simply, compared to AWS S3, </span><strong>3FS is built for speed, not just storage</strong><span>. While S3 is a reliable and scalable object store, it comes with higher latency and eventual consistency, making it less ideal for AI training workloads that require fast, real-time data access. 3FS, on the other hand, is a high-performance distributed file system that leverages </span><strong>SSDs and RDMA</strong><span> networks to deliver low-latency, high-throughput storage</span><strong>.</strong><span> It supports </span><strong>random access to training data</strong><span>, </span><strong>efficient checkpointing</strong><span>, and </span><strong>strong consistency</strong><span>, eliminating the need for extra caching layers or workarounds. For AI-heavy workloads that demand rapid iteration and distributed compute, 3FS offers a more optimized, AI-native storage layer—</span><strong>trading off some cost and operational complexity for raw speed and performance</strong><span>.</span></p><p><span>Because this is a specific framework from DeepSeek, you would have </span><a href="https://github.com/deepseek-ai/3FS/blob/main/deploy/README.md" rel="">to deploy your own the 3FS cluster</a><span> if you want to reach the same performance. There's no fully managed option there... or maybe this is an idea for a spinoff startup from DeepSeek? 😉</span></p><p>One interesting experiment would be to test performance at the same scale using AWS S3.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <p>At first glance, Frank Herbert’s <em>Dune </em>(1965) might appear to be a mere copy of the story of Lawrence of Arabia with some science-fictional window dressing. Several critics have pointed to the similarities between Lawrence and Paul Atreides—both are foreign figures who immerse themselves in a desert culture and help lead the locals to overthrow their oppressors.</p>
<p>The 1962 film based on a romanticized version of Lawrence’s journey, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056172/"><em>Lawrence of Arabia </em>(directed by David Lean)</a>, was critically acclaimed and widely popular. It rested on the idea of the ‘white savior,’ whose role was to lend a sympathetic ear to oppressed peoples and provide assistance to improve their lot in life. Released at a time when U.S. relations in the Middle East were becoming more complicated and the Cold War was reaching new heights of tension, this offered a potentially reassuring message that Western involvement in foreign affairs could be heroic and therefore welcomed.</p>

<p>Herbert himself was very interested in exploring desert cultures and religions. As part of his extensive research and writing process, he read hundreds of books, including T.E. Lawrence’s wartime memoir, <em>Seven Pillars of Wisdom: A Triumph</em> (1926) [Brian Herbert, <em>Dreamer of </em>Dune, Tom Doherty Associates, 2003] He saw messianic overtones in Lawrence’s story and the possibility for outsiders to manipulate a culture according to their own purposes. [Timothy O’Reilly, <em>Frank Herbert</em>, Frederick Ungar Publishing, 1981]</p>
<p>Yet, although Lawrence’s narrative was certainly an inspiration for key aspects of <em>Dune</em>, there are also critical contrasts in the portrayals of Lawrence and Paul, the Arabs and the Fremen, women, and religion. What follows is a discussion of some similarities and differences between the fictional world of <em>Dune </em>and the worlds in <em>Seven Pillars of Wisdom</em> as filtered through Lawrence’s recollections of his time as a go-between figure in the British and Arab camps during World War I. This overview will demonstrate how Herbert adapted and modified elements of Lawrence’s story to create a world in <em>Dune </em>that is both familiar and new.</p>

<h4>Introducing Lawrence</h4>
<p>The subject of over 70 biographies and multiple films, plays, and other writings, T.E. Lawrence is a household name for many in the West. [Scott Anderson, “<a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/true-story-lawrence-arabia-180951857/?page=1">The True Story of Lawrence of Arabia</a>,” <em>Smithsonian Magazine</em>, 2014] He was an officer in the British Army during WWI who served as an adviser to the Arabs and helped in their revolt against the Turks, though the extent of his influence is disputed among historians. [Stanley Weintraub, “<a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/T-E-Lawrence">T.E. Lawrence</a>,” Encyclopedia Britannica, 2020] Other figures, such as British archaeologist and writer Gertrude Bell, were better known at the time and arguably had a greater impact on Middle Eastern politics. [Georgina Howell, <em>Queen of the Desert: The Extraordinary Life of Gertrude Bell</em>, Pan Books, 2015] But after American journalist Lowell Thomas seized upon Lawrence’s story in 1918, Lawrence’s fame grew to eclipse that of his contemporaries.</p>
<p>Interestingly, whether or not others consider Lawrence of Arabia to be a hero, Lawrence does not portray himself that way in <em>Seven Pillars of Wisdom</em>. Instead, he appears as a conflicted man, trying to bridge two worlds but feeling like a fraud. On the one hand, he explains the ways in which he becomes like one of the Arabs: in dress, in mannerisms, and in the ability to appreciate desert living. He takes some pleasure in being hardier and more knowledgeable than his fellow British associates.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there are varying degrees of contempt in his descriptions of the Arabs and their differences from the British. Filtering his experiences through his British sensibilities creates a sense of superiority at times that adds to the cultural barrier he faces. Although Lawrence himself may have been accepted and respected by his Arab companions, the image of Lawrence of Arabia is problematic for its implication that native peoples need a ‘white savior’ to rescue them from their oppression.</p>
<p>This continues to be a topic of debate in relation to <em>Dune</em>, as shown, for example, in Emmet Asher-Perrin’s Tor.com article <a href="https://reactormag.com/2019/03/06/why-its-important-to-consider-whether-dune-is-a-white-savior-narrative/">Why It’s Important to Consider Whether <em>Dune</em> Is a White Savior Narrative</a>.</p>

<h4>Lawrence of Arabia</h4>

Lawrence taken by American journalist Lowell Thomas in 1919</figcaption></figure>
<p>Both Lawrence and Paul appear to be men raised in Western cultures who adopt the ways of a Middle Eastern culture in order to blend in and meet their goal of rallying a fighting force to meet their own (imperial) goals. They understand the importance of desert power and act as a bridge between the two worlds they inhabit to facilitate the use of this force.</p>
<p>Looking first at Lawrence, he admits early on that his book is not a history of the Arab movement but of himself in the movement. It is about his daily life and encounters with people, with the war providing a sense of purpose to structure the narrative. In short, this purpose is to convince enough Arab tribes to side with Prince Feisal against the Turks to defeat them. It means persuading the tribes to put aside their grudges and vendettas, and sometimes their ways of tribal justice, to form a cohesive front.</p>
<p>Lawrence already knows Arabic and how to wear the skirts and head-cloth of the Arab outfit, but he gains a deeper understanding of the language and culture through his experience traveling in the Middle East. For example, he discovers how important it is to have a broad knowledge of the various peoples who live in the desert if one wants to be accepted as an insider: “In the little-peopled desert every worshipful man knew every other; and instead of books they studied their generation. To have fallen short in such knowledge would have meant being branded either as ill-bred, or as a stranger; and strangers were not admitted to familiar intercourse or councils, or confidence.” [Lawrence, p 416-417*] He is used to book knowledge being valued. Now he must adjust to picking up information tidbits to gain the trust of new tribes and persuade them to his and Feisal’s cause.</p>
<p>In terms of clothing, Lawrence comes to accept the Arab dress as “convenient in such a climate” and blends in with his Arab companions by wearing it instead of the British officer uniform. [Lawrence, p 111] This reduces the sense that he is from a different culture and way of life. He learns the advantages of “going bare foot” to gain a better grip on tough terrain but also the pain of having no shoe protection in rocky or snowy terrain. [Lawrence, p 486] He writes of the incredulity of Egyptian and British military police in Cairo when he answers their questions in Arabic with fluent English: “They looked at my bare feet, white silk robes and gold head-rope and dagger…I was burned crimson and very haggard with travel. (Later I found my weight to be less than seven stone [44 kg/98 lb]).” [Lawrence, p 327-328] Here Lawrence paints a picture of himself as seen through their eyes—a scrawny, sunburned, barefoot leader dressed like an Arab but speaking English like a British person.</p>
<p>Sometimes his transformation leads to feelings of shame, showing Lawrence’s discomfort with the idea that he has ‘gone native.’ At the close of the book, once Damascus has been conquered, he has an unusual encounter with a medical major:</p>
<p>With a brow of disgust for my skirts and sandals he said, ‘You’re in charge?’ Modestly I smirked that in a way I was, and then he burst out, ‘Scandalous, disgraceful, outrageous, ought to be shot…’ At this onslaught I cackled out like a chicken, with the wild laughter of strain…I hooted out again, and he smacked me over the face and stalked off, leaving me more ashamed than angry, for in my heart I felt he was right, and that anyone who pushed through to success a rebellion of the weak against their masters must come out of it so stained in estimation that afterward nothing in the world would make him feel clean. However, it was nearly over. [Lawrence, p 682]</p>
<p>While the medical major is disgusted at Lawrence’s Arab appearance and thinks he has sullied himself, Lawrence seems to feel ashamed of having taken on this appearance as a way of manipulating the Arabs to rebel. He feels dirtied by his role but knows that his part in this performance is almost over.</p>
<p>The strategic advantage that Lawrence identifies is that the Arabs are on their own turf and can engage in guerilla-style attacks, then retreat into the desert with minimal casualties. Throughout <em>Seven Pillars</em>, Lawrence describes how he led small groups of men to sabotage the Turks’ transportation and communication networks by installing explosives in key parts of the railway such as bridges. Their ability to quickly maneuver on camels and disappear made them difficult targets to anticipate or defend against. He makes a comparison between this ‘desert power’ and naval power, which the British were very familiar with:</p>
<p>‘He who commands the sea is at great liberty, and may take as much or as little of the war as he will.’ And we commanded the desert. Camel raiding parties, self-contained like ships, might cruise confidently along the enemy’s cultivation-frontier, sure of an unhindered retreat into their desert-element which the Turks could not explore. [Lawrence, p 345]</p>
<p>As a fighting force, the camels were also formidable. Lawrence says that “a charge of ridden camels going nearly thirty miles an hour was irresistible.” [Lawrence, p 310] Another advantage was that the Arabs’ numbers were constantly in flux due to a reliance on a mixture of tribes rather than one main armed force. This meant “No spies could count us, either, since even ourselves had not the smallest idea of our strength at any given moment.” [Lawrence, p 390] Lawrence’s narrative shows his appreciation for this way of waging war and how much his thinking adapts in response to his new environment.</p>

<h4>Paul Muad’Dib</h4>
<p>How does this picture of Lawrence transformed into Lawrence of Arabia compare with the characterization of Paul Atreides in <em>Dune</em>?</p>
<p>Paul is also raised in a Western-like style yet able to adopt the ways of a foreign people with relative ease. He is curious about the “will-o’-the-sand people called Fremen” even before he moves from Caladan to Arrakis. [Herbert, p 5*] Once there, he relies on his training as the son of a duke and a Bene Gesserit to understand and adapt to the local culture.</p>
<p>Paul somehow knows how to properly fit a stillsuit on his first try, as if it were already natural to him. His knowledge and intelligence impress the Imperial Planetologist Dr. Liet Kynes, who believes Paul fits with the legend: “<em>He shall know your ways as though born to them</em>.” [Herbert, p 110] Compare this with a passage from <em>Seven Pillars</em>: “Now as it happened I had been educated in Syria before the war to wear the entire Arab outfit when necessary without strangeness, or sense of being socially compromised.” [Lawrence, p 111] Unlike Lawrence, Paul has the advantage of his growing prescience to give him special foreknowledge of how to adjust to his new environment, as well as a savior narrative to align with. But both are able to take on the garb of a different culture relatively smoothly.</p>
<p>Besides dress, their outward attitude toward the foreigners they find themselves among is similar. Lawrence states idealistically that “I meant to make a new nation, to restore a lost influence, to give twenty millions of Semites the foundation on which to build an inspired dream-palace of their national thoughts.” [Lawrence, p 23] Once among the Fremen, Paul is named Paul Muad’Dib and Usul and learns how to live according to their cultural norms and values. He presumes to help train and lead the Fremen so they can fight against their common enemy, the Harkonnen, and turn Arrakis into a water-filled paradise. But both figures admit that what they actually need is a fighting force. The promise of independence they hold out is thus a means to an end.</p>
<p>The idea of desert power in Lawrence’s story also appears in <em>Dune</em>. Duke Leto informs his son, Paul, of this shift in how to maintain control of their new planet. He tells Paul, “On Caladan, we ruled with sea and air power…Here, we must scrabble for desert power.” [Herbert, p 104] Later, Paul shows that he has accepted this as his own strategy: “Here, it’s <em>desert power</em>. The Fremen are the key.” [Herbert, p 204] Just as the Turks were constantly stymied by the Arab attacks on their equipment and forces, the Harkonnen find themselves with severe losses due to the Fremen raids. Their underestimation of the Fremen leaves them vulnerable. By the time they acknowledge that they have been losing five troops to every one Fremen, it is too late.</p>
<p>Herbert gives the Fremen on their sandworms a final dramatic military maneuver when they ride in to attack the Emperor after using atomics to blow open the Shield Wall. Just like the camels that Lawrence describes create an “irresistible” charge during battle, the sandworms handily plow through the Emperor’s forces in their surprise appearance.</p>
<p>Compare Lawrence’s description of the camel-mounted forces surrounding him at an honor march with Herbert’s scene:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…the forces behind us swelled till there was a line of men and camels winding along the narrow pass towards the watershed for as far back as the eye reached…behind them again the wild mass of twelve hundred bouncing camels of the bodyguard, packed as closely as they could move, the men in every variety of coloured clothes and the camels nearly as brilliant in their trappings. We filled the valley to its banks with our flashing stream. [Lawrence, p 144-145]</p>
<p>Out of the sand haze came an orderly mass of flashing shapes—great rising curves with crystal spokes that resolved into the gaping mouths of sandworms, a massed wall of them, each with troops of Fremen riding to the attack. They came in a hissing wedge, robes whipping in the wind as they cut through the melee on the plain. [Herbert, p 464]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Both passages give a sense of the magnitude of these mounted forces prepared to do battle. They even use similar imagery: a “flashing stream” and “flashing shapes,” a “wild mass” and “a massed wall.” To any enemy who had discounted the desert dwellers as merely a pest, these mounted forces prove the error in that assumption.</p>
<p>Like Lawrence, by bringing new insights, training, and “skilled assistance,” Paul aids local efforts to achieve victory. [Lawrence, p 113] He also holds a more expansive vision of what can be achieved, and acts as a bridge between the worlds of the Fremen and the Imperium. This is how Paul becomes a Lawrence of Arabia figure, and the clear parallels between the desert in Dune and the Middle East only add to this sense.</p>

<h4>Differing Emotions</h4>
<p>Despite their similarities, Lawrence appears much more conflicted than Paul about his role in adopting the ways of a foreign people and assuming such great authority over them. His anxiety is peppered throughout <em>Seven Pillars</em> as he describes his attempt to inhabit two worlds.</p>

<h4>A Conflicted Man</h4>
<p>Lawrence admits that he is unprepared for the large role he is given in the Middle East during WWI, but out of duty or other reasons he stays the course. He says, “I was unfortunately as much in command of the campaign as I pleased, and was untrained.” [Lawrence, p 193] When he is told to return to Arabia and Feisal after believing he was done in the region, he notes that this task goes against his grain—he is completely unfit for the job, he hates responsibility, and he is not good with persuading people. His only knowledge of soldiering is as a student at Oxford reading books about Napoleon’s campaigns and Hannibal’s tactics. Yet he is still forced to go and “take up a role for which I felt no inclination.” [Lawrence, p 117]</p>
<p>Deeper into the 700-page memoir, Lawrence writes more specifically and frequently about feeling like a fraud and trying to serve two masters. He foreshadows his conflictions early on, believing that “In my case, the effort for these years to live in the dress of Arabs, and to imitate their mental foundation, quitted me of my English self, and let me look at the West and its conventions with new eyes: they destroyed it all for me. At the same time I could not sincerely take on the Arab skin: it was an affectation only.” [Lawrence, p 30]</p>
<p>Although he gains a new perspective on his own culture, he acknowledges that his role was part of a performance. He knows that “I must take up again my mantle of fraud in the East…It might be fraud or it might be farce: no one should say that I could not play it.” [Lawrence, p 515] This means having to present different faces to the British and the Arabs, and he knows the latter will necessarily suffer in the face of the former’s might. He says, “Not for the first or last time service to two masters irked me… Yet I could not explain to Allenby the whole Arab situation, nor disclose the full British plan to Feisal… Of course, we were fighting for an Allied victory, and since the English were the leading partners, the Arabs would have, in the last resort, to be sacrificed for them. But was it the last resort?” [Lawrence, p 395] In one instance, he feels homesick and like an outcast among the Arabs, someone who has “exploited their highest ideals and made their love of freedom one more tool to help England win.” [Lawrence, p 560]</p>
<p>The words he uses paint a dismal picture of his complicity in winning the Arabs’ trust. He believes that “I was raising the Arabs on false pretenses, and exercising a false authority over my dupes” and that “the war seemed as great a folly as my sham leadership a crime.” [Lawrence, p 387] Again he calls them “our dupes, wholeheartedly fighting the enemy” but still the “bravest, simplest and merriest of men.” [Lawrence, p 566]</p>

Lawrence (right of Feisal) at Paris Peace Conference in 1919</figcaption></figure>
<p>It especially seems to bother him that he is a foreigner—from a large colonial power, no less—preaching to them about the need for national freedom. He states, “When necessary, I had done my share of proselytizing fatigues, converting as best I could; conscious all the time of my strangeness, and of the incongruity of an alien’s advocating national liberty.” [Lawrence, p 458] He calls himself “the stranger, the godless fraud inspiring an alien nationality” who hopes “to lead the national uprising of another race, the daily posturing in alien dress, preaching in alien speech.” [Lawrence, p 564, 514]</p>
<p>Such feelings prey on his mind and make him fearful of being left with his thoughts: “My will had gone and I feared to be alone, lest the winds of circumstance, or power, or lust, blow my empty soul away.” [Lawrence, p 514] He also suspects that there must be something in him that enabled such a duplicitous performance: “I must have had some tendency, some aptitude, for deceit, or I would not have deceived men so well, and persisted two years in bringing to success a deceit which others had framed and set afoot…Suffice it that since the march to Akaba I bitterly repented my entanglement in the movement, with a bitterness sufficient to corrode my inactive hours, but insufficient to make me cut myself clear of it.” [Lawrence, p 569]</p>
<p>But Lawrence still finds himself craving a good reputation among others and feeling guilty that he of all people should have one. He sees that “Here were the Arabs believing me, Allenby and Clayton trusting me, my bodyguard dying for me: and I began to wonder if all established reputations were founded, like mine, on fraud.” [Lawrence, p 579]</p>

<h4>A Confident Man</h4>
<p>The reflections on fraudulence and guilt in Lawrence’s book stand out as aspects that are mostly absent in the characterization of Paul in <em>Dune</em>. Paul does have some fears about his ability to prevent the jihad he foresees. But he appears fully able to reconcile his position as a duke in exile with his position as a leader among the Fremen who supposedly has their interests at heart. In comparison to Lawrence, Paul appears overly confident and unbothered by his use of foreign forces to gain authority and territorial rule.</p>
<p>As discussed above, Paul is explicitly told by his father about the importance of desert power. He seems to think his status entitles him to not only secure safety and survival among the Fremen, but to convince them to sacrifice themselves to help him reclaim his House’s ruling authority. And his plan is made even smoother by the fact that the way has already been paved by the Bene Gesserit’s Missionaria Protectiva for him to be accepted as a messiah figure.</p>
<p>Despite Paul seeing the likelihood of a terrible jihad waged by a combination of Atreides forces and Fremen warriors, there is little indication of an effort to take a different path. Paul describes how he “suddenly saw how fertile was the ground into which he had fallen, and with this realization, the terrible purpose filled him.” [Herbert, p 199] He foresees a path with “peaks of violence…a warrior religion there, a fire spreading across the universe with the Atreides green and black banner waving at the head of fanatic legions drunk on spice liquor.” [Herbert, p 199] He even seems to blame the Fremen for this at times. For example, he feels that “this Fremen world was fishing for him, trying to snare him in its ways. And he knew what lay in that snare—the wild jihad, the religious war he felt he should avoid at any cost.” [Herbert, p 346-347]</p>
<p>Somewhat arrogantly, he believes that he is the only one who can prevent this from happening. On the day of his sandworm riding test, “Half pridefully, Paul thought: <em>I cannot do the simplest thing without its becoming a legend…every move I make this day. Live or die, it is a legend. I must not die. Then it will be only legend and nothing to stop the jihad</em>.” [Herbert, p 388] On seeing the Fremen leader Stilgar transformed into “a receptacle for awe and obedience” toward him, Paul tells himself, “<em>They sense that I must take the throne…But they cannot know I do it to prevent the jihad</em>.” [Herbert, p 469]</p>
<p>Yet he, along with his mother, are the ones who train the Fremen to become even more skilled warriors, and he invites them to defeat not only the Harkonnen but the Emperor himself. Thus, Paul conveniently overlooks his own actions which directly contribute to this outbreak of violence across the universe. It is only toward the end of the book that he recognizes his role: “And Paul saw how futile were any efforts of his to change any smallest bit of this. He had thought to oppose the jihad within himself, but the jihad would be. His legions would rage out from Arrakis even without him. They needed only the legend he already had become. He had shown them the way.” [Herbert, p 482]</p>
<p>Whereas Lawrence reveals increased feelings of guilt during his time among the Arabs, Paul appears more and more confident, buoyed by his prescient abilities and victories over his enemies. And although both <em>Seven Pillars of Wisdom </em>and <em>Dune </em>have arguably successful endings for the peoples that have received external assistance, there is a sense that Lawrence is relieved that he can relinquish his position of authority, while Paul is triumphant at his rising power. He also displays his sense of ownership and control over the Fremen as a people, unequivocally stating that “The Fremen are mine.” [Herbert, p 489]</p>
<p>This represents a clear difference between these two men and how they process responsibility and authority. Paul is indeed a Lawrence of Arabia-type character, but appears to be absolved of the sense of fraudulence and guilt that Lawrence returns to again and again in his reflections.</p>

<h4>Orientalizing Tendencies</h4>
<p>There are also differences in Lawrence’s account of the Arabs as compared to Paul’s understanding of the Fremen. Although both use stereotypes, Lawrence’s descriptions have a greater tendency to contain Orientalist attitudes about non-Western cultures.</p>
<p>In brief, according to the famous Palestinian American academic Edward Said, Orientalism refers to the way that Westerners have historically set up a distinction between East and West, Orient and Occident, without acknowledging that this is a human-created construct that strengthens the power of the West. [<em>Orientalism</em>, Vintage, (first ed 1978) 2003] This perpetuates the idea that the West is superior to the East and reinforces stereotypes about who is civilized and who is human. In an Orientalist perspective, there is an “absolute and systematic difference between the West, which is rational, developed, humane, superior, and the Orient, which is aberrant, undeveloped, inferior.” [Said, p 300]</p>
<p>Said’s theory has been widely used in academic circles to analyze concepts such as imperialism, colonialization, and racism. It is also used as a lens to analyze cultural products like books, films, and advertising. Because Said specifically focuses on the Middle East and depictions of Arabs in his work, it is particularly useful in examining texts related to these.</p>

<h4>The Arabs</h4>
<p>Having spent extended periods of time living with various Arab groups, Lawrence is able to move past some stereotypes. As discussed above, there are certainly aspects of the Arabs that he finds beneficial. Although the living conditions can be difficult, he displays a certain amount of respect for the way the nomads, in particular, have carved out a living through use of dress, camels, wells, and other adaptations to the landscape and climate. He himself adopts their ways and language and communicates with them about complex military operations.</p>
<p>Certain men he describes favorably, such as Prince Feisal: “In appearance he was tall, graceful and vigorous, with the most beautiful gait, and a royal dignity of head and shoulders.” [Lawrence, p 98] Another leader he characterizes with less positive language: “Nuri, the hard, silent, cynical old man, held the tribe between his fingers like a tool.” [Lawrence, p 641]</p>
<p>Lawrence is more neutral in tone about his observations regarding how the Arabs organize themselves. He portrays the tribal structure and lack of hierarchy as somewhat of a double-edged sword. On the one hand, society is more egalitarian and “there were no distinctions, traditional or natural.” [Lawrence, p 161] This means that a leader must earn their position through merit and share the experiences of living and eating with those in their ranks.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it means that they are less likely to form the kind of large, disciplined armies that nations like Britain use for conquest and control. Lawrence explains how it takes Feisal two years to settle all of the blood feuds in the region so that different tribes can unite in war against the Turks. Because their “idea of nationality was the independence of clans and villages,” it is more challenging to ask them to view themselves as part of an Arab nation. [Lawrence, p 103]</p>
<p>Lawrence’s descriptions of the Arabs as a people show the type of Orientalist tendencies that Said criticizes. Lawrence claims that they are a simple people, willing believers, and undisciplined fighters who need leadership and guidance to harness their potential. He also sometimes uses the language of savagery, perhaps in an attempt to differentiate himself, whom he considers a civilized Englishman, from the tribesmen.</p>
<p>In his observations, it is clear he is using his own culture as a reference point: “They were a dogmatic people, despising doubt, our modern crown of thorns. They did not understand our metaphysical difficulties, our introspective questionings. They knew only truth and untruth, belief and unbelief, without our hesitating retinue of finer shades…they were a limited, narrow-minded people.” [Lawrence, p 36]</p>
<p>Yet their minds are fully open to belief and obedience, according to Lawrence. One of his pieces of evidence is that three of the great world religions (Judaism, Christianity, Islam) arose out of this region and found ways of prospering among the people.</p>
<p>His opinion is that “Arabs could be swung on an idea as on a cord; for the unpledged allegiance of their minds made them obedient servants. None of them would escape the bond till success had come, and with it responsibility and duty and engagements…Their mind was strange and dark, full of depressions and exaltations, lacking in rule, but with more of ardour and more fertile in belief than any other in the world.” [Lawrence, p 41]</p>
<p>Lawrence sees this characteristic of obedience as full of potential, but only if it can be used to establish discipline. He describes how the Arabs perform well in small units but “[i]n mass they were not formidable, since they had no corporate spirit, nor discipline nor mutual confidence.” [Lawrence, p 140] After “spartan exercises” and training, though, they can become “excellent soldiers, instantly obedient and capable of formal attack.” [Lawrence, p 141] The goal appears to be to use the men’s usual fighting style for guerilla attacks when needed, but also train them to be able to fight in a more formal style that will help the Allies.</p>

<h4>The Fremen</h4>
<p>There are certainly several general parallels between the cultures of the Arabs and the Fremen. A strong Arabic influence appears in <em>Dune </em>through the use of Arab history, topography, culture, and words. Herbert borrows substantially from Arabic with terms such as Muad’Dib, Usul, Lisan Al-Gaib, Sayyadina, Shari-a, and Shaitan. [Istvan Csicsery-Ronay Jr, <em>Seven Beauties of Science Fiction</em>, Wesleyan University Press, 2008, p 39; Karin Christina Ryding, “The Arabic of <em>Dune</em>: Language and Landscape,” In <em>Language in Place: Stylistic Perspectives on Landscape, Place and Environment</em>, edited by Daniela Francesca Virdis, Elisabetta Zurru, and Ernestine Lahey, John Benjamins Publishing, 2021]</p>
<p>Critics have pointed to an analogy between the Fremen and Bedouin Arabs due to their cultures being nomadic, using guerilla war tactics, and having to live in harmony with nature out of necessity. [Csicsery-Ronay; B. Herbert; O’Reilly] In addition, the camel and sandworm are both used for transportation, warfare, and economic and cultural needs. [Hoda M. Zaki, “Orientalism in Science Fiction.” In <em>Food for Our Grandmothers: Writings by Arab-American and Arab-Canadian Feminists</em>, edited by Joanna Kadi, South End Press, 1994, p 182]</p>
<p>The overall characterization of the Fremen may be considered an overly romantic vision of Arab Bedouin society: long, flowing robes and dark or tanned skin; the practice of polygamy; values such as honor, trust, and bravery; and tribes that live primitive and simple lives in response to a brutal environment. [Zaki, p 183]</p>
<p>The representation of desert peoples through the Atreides’ eyes does rely on some romanticized notions. However, it can be seen as relying on fewer negative stereotypes than the depiction of the Arabs in Lawrence’s book.</p>
<p>In the Atreides’ view, the Fremen appear at first to be a suspicious and cautious people, willing to see if they can work with the Atreides or if they will need to consider them hostile like the Harkonnen. In the meantime, the Fremen helpfully provide solid intelligence and gifts of value such as stillsuits. Following his father, Paul accepts the view that the Fremen could be the allies and ‘desert power’ that they need. He thus has a clear incentive to look upon them favorably, just as Lawrence does.</p>
<p>When he sees the Fremen Stilgar for the first time, he feels the leader’s commanding presence: “A tall, robed figure stood in the door…A light tan robe completely enveloped the man except for a gap in the hood and black veil that exposed eyes of total blue—no white in them at all…In the waiting silence, Paul studied the man, sensing the aura of power that radiated from him. He was a leader—a <em>Fremen</em> leader.” [Herbert, p 92] Stilgar brings with him a sense of authority that all recognize. This aligns with how Lawrence describes Feisal—with a sense of destiny: “I felt at first glance that this was the man I had come to Arabia to seek – the leader who would bring the Arab Revolt to full glory. Feisal looked very tall and pillar-like, very slender, in his long white silk robes and his brown head-cloth bound with a brilliant scarlet and gold cord.” [Lawrence, p 92]</p>
<p>Also similar to Lawrence, Paul comes to understand and respect the way the Fremen have made the harsh environment livable through their stillsuits, sandworm riding, and other adaptations. When he realizes that the Fremen do not fear the desert because they know how to “<em>outwit the worm</em>”, he is impressed. [Herbert, p 125]</p>
<p>He notes the difference between his world—heavily regulated by the faufreluches class system—and that of the Fremen, who “lived at the desert edge without caid or bashar to command them” and were not recorded in Imperial censuses. [Herbert, p 4-5] Like Lawrence, he appears not to mind his experience living in a tribal structure, though both men still enjoy a certain privilege as outsiders. He learns how to ride sandworms, just as Lawrence learns how to ride camels.</p>
<p>Along with his mother, Jessica, Paul finds success in teaching Fremen fighters how to engage in more effective attacks against the Harkonnen. Jessica realizes that “<em>The little raids, the certain raids—these are no longer enough now that Paul and I have trained them. They feel their power. They want to fight.</em>” [Herbert, p 399]</p>
<p>Yet the concept of these desert peoples being simple-minded and willing to believe anything is also present in <em>Dune</em>. Fremen society has been sown with the myths and legends of the Bene Gesserit’s Missionaria Protectiva, which primes them to accept Jessica and Paul as savior figures without much question. Jessica knowingly capitalizes on these legends to solidify her and Paul’s status, and Paul is pulled along into the mythos.</p>
<p>In comparison to these two rational-seeming figures, the Fremen can appear superstitious and trapped in their traditional ways. Their minds seem especially open to belief and obedience, in a way similar to how Lawrence describes the Arabs.</p>
<p>Arguably this is part of Herbert’s study of religions and his critique of people’s willingness to follow religious leaders and their promises: The Missionaria Protectiva goes out to many planets and populations, not just the Fremen. But the Orientalist overtones remain an inescapable part of the Fremen’s characterization, with ‘enlightened’ leaders needing to come to assist supposedly ‘inferior’ native peoples. The Fremen as a whole shift from independent tribal groups to commando forces operating under Paul’s guidance and religious authority. No matter how independent and authoritative Stilgar is initially, he too comes to believe in the legend and defers to Paul.</p>
<p>However, it is significant that the main characters themselves essentially <em>become </em>Fremen, even though this is out of necessity and somewhat exploitative. Just like Lawrence sees some of the Arabs’ ways as beneficial and chooses to adopt them, Paul and Jessica see the value of the Fremen’s ways in the desert environment and adopt them. They learn the water discipline necessary for desert survival. Jessica becomes a Fremen Reverend Mother and thus a key keeper of memory and advisor for the tribe. Paul accepts the mantle of messiah, new names, and a Fremen woman, Chani, as his concubine.</p>
<p>Basically, they both accept a hybrid identity as the new norm for their lives—a type of uniting of West and East that helps them defeat their mutual enemies. [Kara Kennedy, “<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/303317810_Epic_World-Building_Names_and_Cultures_in_Dune">Epic World-Building: Names and Cultures in <em>Dune</em></a>” <em>Names</em>, vol. 64, no. 2, p 106] This adds more dimension and nuance to the depiction of the Fremen and their culture, preventing it from relying solely on Orientalist stereotypes. And unlike Lawrence, who eventually returns to England, Paul remains close to the desert environment and influenced by Fremen in his role as ruler.</p>
<h4>Women and Religion</h4>

<p>There are two other notable differences between the worlds of <em>Seven Pillars </em>and <em>Dune</em>. One is the portrayal of women.</p>
<p>Lawrence’s book is clearly positioned as a man’s story about a male domain (war) likely intended for a male audience, and there are only a few mentions of women in total. Lawrence makes some brief reflections about the lack of women, but this mainly seems to be so that he can comment on the effect the absence has on men. He says the Arab leaders rely on their instinct and intuition and “Like women, they understood and judged quickly, effortlessly.” [Lawrence, p 221] He attributes this to “the Oriental exclusion of woman from politics”—that men end up taking on both so-called masculine and feminine characteristics in women’s absence. [Lawrence, p 221] He notes that “from end to end of it there was nothing female in the Arab movement, but the camels.” [Lawrence, p 221]</p>
<p>In contrast, women are very much present throughout <em>Dune</em>. A woman opens not only the book itself, but each unnumbered chapter within. This is the voice of Princess Irulan, the Emperor’s daughter, who authors the epigraphs and enters as a character at the book’s close. Irulan’s role is significant for shaping how the reader interprets each chapter. Her writings foreshadow key points and add to the sense that certain events are destined to happen.</p>
<p>Jessica appears so often she can be considered a main character alongside Paul. Being one of the Bene Gesserit, she is a highly skilled woman who takes responsibility for training and guiding her son, and securing their safety and survival as outsiders among the Fremen.</p>
<p>Chani is the child of Planetologist Liet Kynes and a Fremen woman and is introduced as a fierce fighter in Stilgar’s group that travels as a military company.</p>
<p>There is certainly no equivalent to these women in Lawrence’s book (or the 1962 film, which has no speaking roles for women in its 227-minute running time). Any comparisons between Paul and Lawrence of Arabia should acknowledge that Paul is not the kind of solitary hero that Lawrence is often held up to be.</p>
<p>The second major difference between the texts is in the portrayal of religion.</p>
<p>In <em>Seven Pillars </em>it is nearly absent. In a book so focused on the Middle East and its people and politics, one might expect some discussion of Islam and religious practices. But as Lawrence explains it, religion is not a major factor in the war the Arabs are fighting since their enemies, the Turks, are also Muslim. He says that “Of religious fanaticism there was little trace”, implying that religion would not be a helpful motivation for the Arabs in their alliance with Allied forces. [Lawrence, p 103]</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <em>Dune </em>is saturated with references to a variety of religions, including Catholicism, Islam, and Buddhism. Paul quotes the Orange Catholic Bible and receives a miniature copy of one. Jessica employs religious incantations from the Missionaria Protectiva to fit the mold of a prophesied figure, and also helps Paul capitalize on these myths. “Appendix II: The Religion of Dune” provides more background information on the different religious currents in the universe and is interwoven with references to real-world religions.</p>
<p>All of these references to and critiques of religion make it a significant aspect of the book. This fits with Herbert’s interest in exploring the nature of the desert environment, and specifically what has caused it to give birth to so many major religions and loyal followers. It also aligns with his warnings about the danger of superhero figures, who he believes are “disastrous for humankind.” [Frank Herbert, “Dangers of the Superhero,” In <em>The Maker of Dune</em>, edited by Tim O’Reilly, Berkley Books, 1987, p 97]</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>In examining Lawrence’s <em>Seven Pillars of Wisdom </em>as a source of inspiration for Herbert’s <em>Dune</em>, we’ve seen that there are multiple similarities, but also significant differences between the two works. T.E. Lawrence and Paul Atreides have much in common, yet while Lawrence expresses his sense of feeling like an unprepared fraud, Paul is bolstered by his training and status to feel much more confident in his leadership. The Arabs and Bedouin tribes are indeed an inspiration for the characterization of the Fremen, and Paul has a more favorable attitude toward desert peoples than Lawrence, who exhibits more overt Orientalizing tendencies. And finally, <em>Dune </em>is much more concerned with including a variety of religious references and a positive portrayal of women than Lawrence, who excludes these aspects almost entirely.</p>
<p>What all this shows is that <em>Dune </em>is not in fact a copy of the story of Lawrence of Arabia with some science-fictional window dressing. Rather, it uses elements of Lawrence’s story and his unique perspective as key ingredients with which to create a new and fascinating world.</p>

<div id="Tab1" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="Element1">
                        <p>The growth rate of real gross domestic product (GDP) measured by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) is a key metric of the pace of economic activity. It is one of the four variables included in the economic projections of Federal Reserve Board members and Bank presidents for every other Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting. As with many economic statistics, GDP estimates are released with a lag whose timing can be important for policymakers. For example, of the four scheduled 2014 release dates of an “advance” (or first) estimate of GDP growth, two are on the second day of a scheduled FOMC meeting with the other two on the day after the meeting. In preparation for FOMC meetings, policymakers have the Fed Board staff projection of this “advance” estimate at their disposal. These projections—available through 2008 at the <a href="http://www.philadelphiafed.org/research-and-data/real-time-center/greenbook-data/">Philadelphia Fed’s Real Time Data Center</a>—have generally been more accurate than forecasts from simple statistical models. As stated by economists <a href="http://amstat.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1198/jbes.2009.07214#.U20Z4FeUWSY">Jon Faust and Jonathan H. Wright in a 2009 paper</a>, “by mirroring key elements of the data construction machinery of the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the Fed staff forms a relatively precise estimate of what BEA will announce for the previous quarter’s GDP even before it is announced.”</p>
<p>The Atlanta Fed GDPNow model also mimics the methods used by the BEA to estimate real GDP growth. The GDPNow forecast is constructed by aggregating statistical model forecasts of 13 subcomponents that comprise GDP. Other private forecasters use similar approaches to “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nowcasting_%28economics%29">nowcast</a>” GDP growth. However, these forecasts are not updated more than once a month or quarter, are not publicly available, or do not have forecasts of the subcomponents of GDP that add “color” to the top-line number. The Atlanta Fed GDPNow model fills these three voids.</p>
<p>The BEA’s advance estimates of the subcomponents of GDP use publicly released data from the U.S. Census Bureau, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, and other sources. Much of this data is displayed in the BEA’s <a href="https://www.bea.gov/data/gdp/gross-domestic-product" target="_blank">Key Source Data and Assumptions</a> table that accompanies the “advance” GDP estimate. GDPNow relates these source data to their corresponding GDP subcomponents using a “bridge equation” approach similar to the one described in a <a href="http://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/qr/qr2022.pdf">Minneapolis Fed</a> study by Preston J. Miller and Daniel M. Chin. Whenever the monthly source data is not available, the missing values are forecasted using econometric techniques similar to those described in papers by <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1198/073500102317351921#.U20n6leUWSY">James H. Stock and Mark W. Watson</a> and <a href="http://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/moneco/v55y2008i4p665-676.html">Domenico Giannone, Lucrezia Reichlin, and David Small</a>. A detailed description of the data sources and methods used in the GDPNow model is provided in an accompanying <a href="https://www.atlantafed.org/pubs/wp/14_07.cfm">Atlanta Fed working paper</a>.</p>
<p>As more monthly source data becomes available, the GDPNow forecast for a particular quarter evolves and generally becomes more accurate. That said, the forecasting error can still be substantial just prior to the “advance” GDP estimate release. It is important to emphasize that the Atlanta Fed GDPNow forecast is a model projection not subject to judgmental adjustments. It is not an official forecast of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, its president, the Federal Reserve System, or the FOMC.</p>

<p><strong>Is GDPNow an official forecast of the Atlanta Fed or the Bank's president?</strong><br>
No, it is not an official forecast of the Atlanta Fed, its president, the Federal Reserve System, or the FOMC.</p>
<p><strong>Is any judgment used to adjust the forecasts?</strong><br>
No. Once the GDPNow model begins forecasting GDP growth for a particular quarter, the code will not be adjusted until after the "advance" estimate. If we improve the model over time, we will roll out changes right after the "advance" estimate so that forecasts for the subsequent quarter use a fixed methodology for their entire evolution. </p>
<p><strong>When will nowcasts of GDP growth in a particular quarter begin and end?</strong><br>
GDPNow nowcasts of real GDP growth in a particular quarter begin about 90 days before the "advance" estimate for GDP growth for the quarter is released; they end on the last business day with a data release GDPNow utilizes that precedes the release date of the Bureau of Economic Analysis’s (BEA) advance estimate of GDP growth. Except after annual benchmark or comprehensive revisions of GDP typically occurring in late July, GDPNow nowcasts for a quarter generally begin on the weekday after the advance estimate of GDP growth for the previous quarter is released. After comprehensive or benchmark GDP revisions, the initial GDPNow nowcast for the subsequent quarter can be delayed for around a week until the BEA releases revised “underlying detail tables” for the National Income and Product Accounts.</p>
<p>For example, GDPNow’s initial nowcast of real GDP growth in the first quarter of 2018 took place on Monday, January 29, 2018, the first weekday after Friday, January 26, 2018, when the advance estimate of real GDP growth in the fourth quarter of 2017 was released. The final GDPNow nowcast of real GDP growth in the first quarter of 2018 was made on April 26, 2018, and the advance estimate of real GDP growth in the first quarter of 2018 was released on April 27, 2018.
</p>
<p><strong>How frequently is the GDPNow forecast updated?</strong><br>
The model forecast is updated six or seven times a month on weekdays, with at least one following seven data releases: <a href="http://www.ism.ws/ismreport/mfgrob.cfm">Manufacturing ISM Report on Business</a>, <a href="http://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/Press-Release/current_press_release/">U.S. International Trade in Goods and Services (FT900)</a>, <a href="http://www.census.gov/wholesale/">Wholesale Trade</a>, <a href="http://www.census.gov/retail/">Monthly Retail Trade Report</a>, <a href="http://www.census.gov/construction/nrc/">New Residential Construction</a>, <a href="http://www.census.gov/manufacturing/m3/adv/pdf/durgd.pdf">Advance Report on Durable Goods Manufacturers</a>, and <a href="http://www.bea.gov/newsreleases/national/pi/pinewsrelease.htm">Personal Income and Outlays</a>. Other data releases, such as <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g17/current/">Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization</a> and <a href="http://www.realtor.org/topics/existing-home-sales">Existing-Home Sales</a>, are incorporated in the model as well and their impact on the model's forecast will be shown on the next weekday with one of the data releases. The proprietary forecasts from <em>Blue Chip Economic Indicators</em> and <em>Blue Chip Financial Forecasts</em> shown in the chart are available from <a href="http://www.bluechippubs.com/">Aspen Publishers</a>.</p>
<p><strong>How can I access historical forecasts from the GDPNow model?</strong><br>
These forecasts are available in <a href="https://www.frbatlanta.org/-/media/Documents/cqer/researchcq/gdpnow/GDPTrackingModelDataAndForecasts.xlsx?la=en">this</a> downloadable spreadsheet. See the tab "ReadMe" in the spreadsheet for hyperlinks to the historical forecasts and other data for the model. In particular, the tab "TrackingDeepArchives" has forecasts for the 2011:Q3–2014:Q1 period (before the model went live), the tab "TrackingArchives" has forecasts from 2014:Q2 through the last quarter for which an advance estimate of GDP has been released by the BEA, and the tab "TrackRecord" has a comparison of the historical GDPNow model forecasts with the actual "advance" real GDP growth estimates from the BEA.</p>
<p><strong>Where can I read about the methods and source data used in the model?</strong><br>
A detailed description is given in a <a href="https://www.atlantafed.org/-/media/documents/research/publications/wp/2014/wp1407.pdf">working paper</a>&nbsp;describing the model. To summarize, the BEA's <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/pdf/allchapters.pdf">NIPA Handbook</a> provides very detailed documentation on both the source data and methods used for estimating the subcomponents of GDP. The late Nobel Prize–winning economist Lawrence Klein pioneered many of the "bridge equation" methods used for making short-run forecasts of GDP growth using this source data; <a href="http://www.tradersshop.com/prod/2011106900000/CQM_Theory_Revision.pdf">a 1989 paper</a> he coauthored with E. Sojo describes the approach. Kathleen Navin, an economist at Macroeconomic Advisers, provides a bird's-eye view illustrating how to use a bridge equation approach in practice to improve GDP forecasts in <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/yx8kzd6dzdxvndd/Navin.pdf?dl=0">this 2017 presentation</a>. The econometric techniques used in our GDPNow model were heavily adapted from the GDP nowcasting models described in a 1996 Minneapolis Fed<em> Quarterly Review</em> article by <a href="http://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/qr/qr2022.pdf">Preston J. Miller and Daniel M. Chin</a> and a <a href="http://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/moneco/v55y2008i4p665-676.html">2008 paper</a> by the Board's David Small and economists Domenico Giannone and Lucrezia Reichlin.</p>
<p><strong>Where can I find alternative forecasts of GDP growth?</strong><br>
For model forecasts from other Reserve Banks, see the <a href="https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/policy/nowcast.html">New York Fed Nowcasting Report</a>, the <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/STLENI">St. Louis Fed Economic News Index: Real GDP Nowcast</a>, the <a href="http://www.philadelphiafed.org/research-and-data/real-time-center/PRISM/">Philadelphia Research Intertemporal Stochastic Model (PRISM)</a>, and the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland's <a href="https://www.clevelandfed.org/en/our-research/indicators-and-data/yield-curve-and-gdp-growth.aspx">prediction model for GDP growth based on the slope of the yield curve</a>. <a href="https://www.economy.com/dismal/models/high-frequency-us-gdp-model.aspx">Moody's Analytics</a> and <a href="http://www.now-casting.com/">Now-Casting.com</a> produce proprietary model short-run GDP forecasts. For survey-based forecasts, see the Philadelphia Fed's <a href="http://www.philadelphiafed.org/research-and-data/real-time-center/survey-of-professional-forecasters/">quarterly Survey of Professional Forecasters,</a> which includes forecasts of real GDP and its major subcomponents. The <em>Wall Street Journal</em>'s <a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/page/economic-forecasting.html">Economic Forecasting Survey</a> occurs monthly, and the Moody's Analytics/CNBC <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/101508204">Rapid Update</a> survey generally occurs several times a week. Neither of these surveys includes forecasts of the subcomponents of GDP.</p>
<p><strong>How accurate are the GDPNow forecasts? Are they more accurate than "professional" forecasts?</strong><br>
The chart below shows GDPNow's real-time forecasts made just prior to the release of the initial estimate of the annualized growth rate of real GDP along with the initial estimates from the US Bureau of Economic Analysis.</p>

<p>Since we started tracking GDP growth with versions of this model in 2011, the average absolute error of final GDPNow forecasts is 0.77 percentage points. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root-mean-square_deviation" target="blank">root-mean-squared error</a> of the forecasts is 1.15 percentage points. These accuracy measures cover initial estimates for 2011:Q3–2024:Q3. Some further analysis of GDPNow's forecast errors is available in <em>macroblog</em> posts located <a href="http://macroblog.typepad.com/macroblog/2016/05/gdpnow-and-then.html">here</a> and <a href="http://macroblog.typepad.com/macroblog/2016/05/can-two-wrongs-make-a-right.html">here</a>. We have made some improvements to the model from its earlier versions, and the model forecasts have become more accurate over time (the complete track record is <a href="https://www.frbatlanta.org/-/media/Documents/cqer/researchcq/gdpnow/GDPTrackingModelDataAndForecasts.xlsx?la=en">here</a>). When back-testing with <em>revised</em> data, the root mean-squared error of the model's out-of sample forecast with the same data coverage that an analyst would have just before the "advance" estimate is 1.15 percentage points for the 2000:Q1–2013:Q4 period. The figure below shows how the forecasts become more accurate as the interval between the date the forecast is made and the forthcoming GDP release date narrows.</p>

<!--<p><img width="472" height="364" title="Root Mean Square Forecast Error of GDP Growth (SAAR) for GDPNow Model" alt="Root Mean Square Forecast Error of GDP Growth (SAAR) for GDPNow Model" src="~/media/Images/cqer/researchcq/gdpnow/gdpnowforecastchart.ashx" class="centeredImage" /></p>-->
<p>Overall, these accuracy metrics do not give compelling evidence that the model is more accurate than professional forecasters. The model does appear to fare well compared to other conventional statistical models.</p>
<p><strong>How are revisions to data not yet reflected in the latest GDP release handled?</strong><br>
In general, the model does not attempt to anticipate how data releases after the latest GDP report will affect the revisions made in the forthcoming GDP release. The exception is the "change in private inventories" subcomponent, where revisions to the prior quarter's reading affect GDP growth in the current quarter. Users of the GDPNow forecast should generally use the forecasts of the change in "net exports" and the change in the "change in private inventories," and not forecasts of the levels. Revisions to retail sales are used to anticipate revisions to real monthly expenditures in the "<a href="http://www.bea.gov/faq/index.cfm?faq_id=519">PCE control group</a>" and revisions to housing starts are used to anticipate revisions in the <a href="http://www.census.gov/construction/c30/c30index.html">monthly value of private residential construction spending put in place</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Do you share your code?</strong><br>
At this point, no. However, the Excel <a href="https://www.frbatlanta.org/-/media/Documents/cqer/researchcq/gdpnow/GDPTrackingModelDataAndForecasts.xlsx?la=en">spreadsheet</a> gives the numerical details—including the raw data and model parameters—of how the monthly data map into forecasts of the subcomponents of GDP.</p>
<p><strong>What are the differences between GDPNow and the FRBNY Nowcast models? Why do the two models have different forecasts?</strong></p>
<p>The FRBNY Nowcast model of real GDP growth is based on a dynamic factor model described in this <a href="http://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2016/04/just-released-introducing-the-frbny-nowcast.html#.Vw0Qz3qgYks">Liberty Street blog entry.</a> The <a href="https://www.chicagofed.org/publications/cfnai/index">Chicago Fed National Activity Index</a> and <a href="https://www.philadelphiafed.org/research-and-data/real-time-center/business-conditions-index">Aruoba-Diebold-Scotti Business Conditions Index</a> are both indicators of economic activity estimated from factor models. The latest nowcast from the FRBNY Nowcast model along with some related Q&amp;A is available <a href="https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/policy/nowcast.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>The Atlanta Fed's GDPNow also uses a dynamic factor model—based on a <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304393208000652">model</a> from one of the New York Fed economists who coauthored the Liberty Street blog entry—but uses the factor only as an input to fill in the yet-to-be-released monthly source data for GDP. The estimates of this dynamic factor are available in the <strong>Factor </strong>tab of this <a href="https://www.atlantafed.org/-/media/documents/cqer/researchcq/gdpnow/GDPTrackingModelDataAndForecasts.xlsx">Excel file</a>.</p>
<p>The monthly source data are then used to estimate the subcomponents of GDP, which are then aggregated up to a real GDP growth nowcast. Besides a dynamic factor model, GDPNow uses several other econometric techniques, including "bridge equations" and Bayesian vector autoregressions, to nowcast the subcomponents of GDP. The exact methods are described in this <a href="https://www.atlantafed.org/sitecore/service/notfound.aspx?item=web%3a%7b8D93F92E-8FC1-46D3-A7F2-A00EF85E4B28%7d%40en">working paper</a>. The numerical details—including the raw data and model parameters—translating the monthly data into nowcasts of the subcomponents of GDP in the latest GDPNow forecast are available in this <a href="https://www.atlantafed.org/-/media/documents/cqer/researchcq/gdpnow/GDPTrackingModelDataAndForecasts.xlsx">Excel file</a> (see the <strong>ReadMe</strong> tab).</p>
<p>Because GDPNow and the FRBNY Nowcast are different models, they can generate different forecasts of real GDP growth. Our policy is not to comment on or interpret any differences between the forecasts of these two models.</p>

                        <p>These charts show how the forecasted GDP subcomponent contributions to growth aggregate up to GDPNow's real GDP growth forecast for each update day in a particular forecast quarter and how changes in the subcomponent contribution forecasts aggregate up to changes in the GDP growth forecasts. Whenever a user hovers the cursor over a bar in one of the charts, the pop-up box displays the data releases for the date of the bar as well the numerical values for the GDP growth forecast and either the levels or changes in the subcomponent contribution forecasts. For previously reported quarters, the final date in the top chart shows the official first estimates of real GDP growth and the subcomponent contributions to growth from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). The final date in the bottom chart shows the forecast errors of the final GDPNow projections of the BEA's first estimates of real GDP growth and the subcomponent contributions to growth.</p>
