<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nvidia has reportedly told Microsoft and at least one other cloud provider that its “Blackwell” B200 AI chips will take at least three months longer to produce than was planned, <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/nvidias-new-ai-chip-is-delayed-impacting-microsoft-google-meta?rc=v4bmzs">according to <em>The Information</em></a><em>. </em>The delay is the result of a design flaw discovered “unusually late in the production process,” according to two unnamed sources, including a Microsoft employee, cited by the outlet<em>. </em></p><p>B200 chips are the follow-up to the supremely popular and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/11/23828874/inside-the-hunt-for-ai-chips-command-line">hard-to-get H100 chips</a> that power vast swaths of the artificial intelligence cloud landscape (and helped make Nvidia <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/18/24181209/nvidia-is-the-worlds-most-valuable-company-at-the-moment">one of the most valuable companies in the world</a>). Nvidia expects production of the chip “to ramp in 2H,” according to a statement that Nvidia spokesperson John Rizzo shared with <em>The Verge</em>. “Beyond that, we don’t comment on rumors.” </p><p>Nvidia is now reportedly working through a fresh set of test runs with chip producer Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, and won’t ship large numbers of Blackwell chips until the first quarter. <em>The Information</em> writes that Microsoft, Google, and Meta, have ordered “tens of billions of dollars” worth of the chips.</p><p>The report comes just months after <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-blackwell-platform-arrives-to-power-a-new-era-of-computing">Nvidia said</a> that “Blackwell-based products will be available from partners” starting in 2024.

    <p>
      All FarmBots must be mounted to a
      <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://bed.farm.bot/">raised bed</a> or similar
      infrastructure. Neither materials for the bed nor soil are included with the kits because every installation will
      be different, and shipping lumber and soil would be prohibitively expensive.

    <p>
      FarmBot must be plugged into a 110 or 220V outlet. The 30cm (1ft) power cord comes with a standard US 3-prong
      plug. You must connect this to your own extension cord if needed. Customers outside the US: you must provide a
      plug adapter if needed.
    </p>

    <p>
      FarmBot's water system has a 3/4″ female Garden Hose Thread (GHT) connection, meaning you can take a standard US
      garden hose and screw it into your FarmBot. You will need to provide a hose of the appropriate length.

    <p>
      FarmBot can only be controlled using the web app, so an internet connection is required. The Raspberry Pi has
      built-in WiFi, though you may need to reposition your WiFi router or install a repeater to ensure a reliable
      connection.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Back in 1970, Sega introduced an arcade game that would pave the way for many of today's most popular video games. Known as <i>Jet Rocket</i>, the electromechanical marvel boasted several world-firsts – even though most people today don't know it ever existed.</p><p><i>Jet Rocket</i>'s premise was a simple one.</p><p>The player was steering an air force jet on a nighttime mission, pushing a trigger button to shoot rockets at military targets passing by on the ground below. Those targets included fuel dumps, missile sites and air strips. Successful hits – good for five points each – were indicated by a burst of light at the hit site along with the sound of an explosion.</p><p>Keep in mind, though, all of this was managed without a computer or even a video screen. Nonetheless, <i>Jet Rocket</i> was the world's first flight simulator game, the first first-person shooter game, and the first game in which the player made their way through a virtual world (known as an "open world" game).</p><div data-align-center="">

            </div><h2>Origin story</h2><p><i>Jet Rocket</i> was developed by Sega in the late 1960s, back when the Japan/Hawaii-based company provided coin-operated games to US military bases in Japan. It was released worldwide in August of 1970, soon becoming very popular in numerous markets.</p><p>Earlier that same year, Sega debuted the game to potential buyers at an expo in the mainland US, where it was likewise well-received. Unfortunately for Sega, though, three Chicago-based companies liked it so much that they immediately produced and released their own blatant, unlicensed copies of it.</p><p>These games included Williams' <i>Flotilla</i>, Bally's <i>Target Zero</i>, and the Chicago Coin Machine Company's <i>Night Bomber</i>. Needless to say, those imitators impacted sales of the game in the North American market.</p><p>"Sega said, 'Man we've got a hit on our hands.' They went back and churned them out, just started making them left and right," says Rusty Key, owner of a <i>Jet Rocket</i> game <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60XfJXCK4js" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0">which he fully restored</a>. "By the time they got them made and shipped back over to the US, Williams and all the others had cornered the market. <i>They</i> [Sega] looked like the ones who were doing the copying."</p><p>Thanks mainly to the emergence of the first new-fangled video games, neither <i>Jet Rocket</i> nor its clones were manufactured for more than a few years.

</div><h2>Release the rockets</h2><p>When the player saw a target approaching, they would steer their jet in such a way that its rocket sight (a projected spot of light) would fall in the path of that target. They would then press a trigger button at one end of the yoke – repeatedly, if necessary – to launch their rockets. The player had to get the angle and the timing just right, though, in order to hit the target.</p><p>As the virtual rockets flew through the air, the player would see them as orange streaks of light moving from either side of the jet down to the ground. This illusion was managed via a V-shaped array of sequentially illuminating lights located inside the cabinet down by the player's legs.</p><p>The reflection of those lights was captured by a downward-angled sheet of clear Plexiglass, situated between the player's face and the canvas-mirror. This means that the player was looking <i>through</i> the Plexiglass – on which the rocket lights were reflected – <i>to</i> the mirror. Therefore, they saw the lights superimposed over their view of the landscape.</p><div data-align-center="">

            </div><h2>A hit and a miss</h2><p>If the player was successful at hitting the target, the latter would illuminate from within, plus the machine would emit the sound of an explosion. But just how did the game <i>know</i> when a target was hit, and how did it make that target glow?</p><p>Putting it simply, the player had to be pressing the trigger just as both the electronic mirror-positioning pads and the target on the canvas were in the correct positions relative to one another. Doing so closed a previously open electrical circuit, which caused a light beneath the canvas to illuminate. That light shone through the foam target, as that target passed over the light.</p><p>Given the fact that no wiring was integrated into the canvas, though, you might wonder how the positions of the targets <i>on</i> that canvas could be monitored. Once again, just bear with us for a bit …</p><p>Inside the cabinet was a row of five pairs of finger-like prongs with an electric current running through them. All of these prongs brushed along the underside of the canvas as it scrolled past. Each pair corresponded to one of five "target areas" which were arranged side-by-side to form a horizontal row of lights beneath the canvas, spanning the width of the landscape. Every target was located in one of these areas.</p><p>On the underside of the canvas, located a set distance from each target, was a square of electrically conductive flexible steel mesh. As that square scrolled by, it contacted the pair of prongs corresponding to that particular target's zone, grounding the prongs in the process.</p><p>This closed the aforementioned circuit, but only <i>if</i> the trigger was currently being pressed. As a result, the light in that zone would flare right as the target passed over it.

            </div><h2>Jet Rocket in 2024</h2><p>It's hard to say how many functional <i>Jet Rocket</i> games are still in existence today, but there definitely can't be many, even if you include the clones. Rusty Key paid just US$100 for his rig, although it required extensive restoration to get back into running order. </p><p>He estimates that a fully restored unit would likely sell for at least $1,000, which actually sounds pretty reasonable. Key is quick to point out, however, that the game is huge and heavy – you can actually go inside the cabinet – so its market is limited. Keeping it running would also definitely require some electromechanical aptitude.</p><p>For Rusty, though, all of the hassles are worth it in order to keep such a piece of history alive.</p><p>"Ingenuity seems to be a trait of a bygone era," he tells us. "To figure out how to do something with limited materials is a skillset on full display in <i>Jet Rocket</i>. It's just as appealing today as it was 50 years ago."</p><p>For a more in-depth explanation of <i>Jet Rocket</i>'s workings and gameplay, take a peek at the following demo/interview with Key kindly provided to us by Todd Tuckey from <a href="https://tntamusements.com/" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0">TNT Amusements</a>.</p><p>And if you think that such contraptions are purely a thing of the past, check out our article on the recently built one-off <i><a href="https://newatlas.com/good-thinking/dual-coincidence-five-way-pinball-electromechanical-game/" data-cms-ai="0">Dual Coincidence</a></i>.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>If the police ever have <a href="https://www.anarsec.guide/glossary/#physical-attacks">physical access</a> to an electronic device like a laptop, even <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/a3q374/hacker-bios-firmware-backdoor-evil-maid-attack-laptop-5-minutes">for five minutes</a>, they can install hardware keyloggers, create images of the storage media, or otherwise trivially compromise it at the hardware, firmware, or software level. One way to minimize this risk is to make devices tamper-evident. As the Threat Library <a href="https://notrace.how/threat-library/mitigations/tamper-evident-preparation.html">notes</a>, "Tamper-evident preparation is the process of taking precautionary measures to make it possible to detect when something has been physically accessed by an adversary."</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evil_maid_attack">'Evil maid' attacks</a> work like this: an attacker gains temporary access to your <a href="https://www.anarsec.guide/glossary/#encryption">encrypted</a> laptop or phone. Although they can’t decrypt your data, they can tamper with your laptop for a few minutes and then leave it exactly where they found it. When you return and enter your credentials, you have been hacked. The attacker may have <a href="https://media.ccc.de/v/gpn20-32-poc-implementing-evil-maid-attack-on-encrypted-boot">modified data on your hard drive</a>, replaced the firmware, or installed a hardware component such as a keylogger.</p>
<p>"Defense in depth" means that there are multiple layers of security that an adversary must bypass in order to succeed. This article will cover tamper-evident laptop screws, storage and firmware, as well as physical intrusion detection. </p>
<h2 id="tamper-evident-laptop-screws">Tamper-Evident Laptop Screws</h2>
<p>Let's start with your laptop. For a seal to effectively alert you to intruders, it must be impossible to remove and replace without leaving a trace, and it must also be unique—otherwise, the adversary could simply replicate the seal and you’d never know they’d been there. Glitter nail polish creates a unique pattern that is impossible to replicate, and if you take a photo of this pattern, you can use it to verify that the nail polish has not been removed and reapplied in your absence, such as during a <a href="https://notrace.how/threat-library/techniques/covert-house-search.html">covert house search</a>. The presentation "<a href="https://media.ccc.de/v/30C3_-_5600_-_en_-_saal_1_-_201312301245_-_thwarting_evil_maid_attacks_-_eric_michaud_-_ryan_lackey">Thwarting Evil Maid Attacks</a>" introduced this technique in 2013. </p>
<p>Mullvad VPN <a href="https://mullvad.net/en/help/how-tamper-protect-laptop/">created a guide</a> for applying this technique: first apply stickers over the laptop case screws, then apply the nail polish. An <a href="https://dys2p.com/en/2021-12-tamper-evident-protection.html#glitzer-nagellack-mit-aufklebern">independent test</a> noted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Attackers without a lot of practice can use a needle or scalpel, for example, to drive under the sticker and push it partially upward to get to the screws relatively easily. The broken areas in the paint could be repaired with clear nail polish, although we did not need to do this in most of our tests. The picture below is a pre-post-comparison of one of our first attempts. Except for 3-4 glitter elements at the top left edge of the sticker, all others are still in the same place. This could be further reduced in subsequent attempts, so we rate this method as only partially suitable. [...] The relevant factor in this process is the amount of elements on the edge of the sticker. In addition, there are special seal stickers available which break when peeled off. They are probably more suitable for this method.</p>
</blockquote>

</p>
<p>For this reason, it is preferable to apply nail polish directly to the screws rather than over a sticker. This direct application is done for <a href="https://docs.nitrokey.com/nitropad/qubes/sealed-hardware">NitroKey</a> and <a href="https://puri.sm/posts/anti-interdiction-update-six-month-retrospective/">Purism</a> laptops. Keep these nuances in mind:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The screws holes are particularly relevant here. If they are too deep, it is difficult to take a suitable photo of the seal under normal conditions. If the hole is shallow or if it is completely filled with nail polish, there is a risk that if a lot of polish is used, the top layer can be cut off and reapplied after manipulation with clear polish. If the nail polish contains too few elements, they could be manually arranged back to the original location after manipulation if necessary.</p>

</p>
<p>Glitter nail polish was successfully bypassed during a Tamper Evident Challenge in 2018 — the winner <a href="https://hoodiepony.medium.com/bypassing-the-glitter-nail-polish-tamper-evident-seal-25d6973d617d">explained</a> how they managed to do it. Notably, a brand of nail polish with relatively large pieces of glitter in only two colors was used. It would be difficult to apply this bypass to inset screw holes; if the glitter was applied with a high density of elements, but not too thick, this would also increase the difficulty. Finally, <a href="https://dys2p.com/en/2021-12-tamper-evident-protection.html#glitzer-nagellack-mit-klebstoff">using an adhesive</a> would also make the bypass less feasible. </p>
<p>Verification that the random pattern hasn't changed can be done manually with what astronomers call a "blink comparison". This is used in astronomy to detect small changes in the night sky: you quickly flick between the original photo and the current one, which makes it easier to see any changes. Alternatively, if you have an Android smartphone (either <a href="https://www.anarsec.guide/posts/grapheneos/">GrapheneOS</a> or a cheap one for <a href="https://www.anarsec.guide/posts/tamper/#physical-intrusion-detection">intrusion detection</a>), you can use an app called <a href="https://github.com/proninyaroslav/blink-comparison">Blink Comparison</a>, which makes it less likely that you will miss something. It can be installed like any other <a href="https://www.anarsec.guide/posts/grapheneos/#how-to-install-software">app that doesn't require Google Services</a>, i.e. not through F-Droid. </p>
<p>The Blink Comparison app encrypts its storage to prevent an adversary from easily replacing the photos, and provides a helpful interface for comparing them. The app helps you take the comparison photo from the same angle and distance as the original photo. Blink Comparison then switches between the two images when you touch the screen, making direct comparison much easier than manually comparing two photos. </p>
<h2 id="in-practice">In practice</h2>
<p>Now that you understand the nuances of applying nail polish to the screws of your laptop case, let's actually do it — if you are going to <a href="https://www.anarsec.guide/posts/tamper/#tamper-evident-software-and-firmware">install Heads firmware</a>, do that first so the nail polish doesn't have to be removed and repeated. Before you start, you can also take a picture of the inside of the laptop in case you ever need to check if the internal components have been tampered with despite the nail polish protection (keep in mind that not all components are visible). Use a nail polish that has different colors and sizes of glitter, like the one shown above. </p>
<ul>
<li>First, take a photo of the bottom of the computer and use a program like GIMP to number the screws to make it easier to verify. For example, the ThinkPad X230 shown above has 13 screws that need to be numbered so that in the future you know which screw the photo <code>3.jpg</code> refers to. </li>
<li>Apply the glitter nail polish directly to each screw, making sure there are enough glitter elements without it being too thick. </li>
<li>Once it is dry, take good close-up photos of each screw — either with the Blink Comparison app on a smartphone or with a regular camera. It is a good idea to use lighting that is reproducible, so close the blinds on any windows and rely on the indoor lighting and the camera flash. Number the file names of the photos and back them up to a second storage location. </li>
</ul>
<p>If you ever need to remove the nail polish to access the inside of the laptop, you can use a syringe to apply the nail polish remover to avoid applying too much and damaging the internal electronics. </p>
<h2 id="tamper-evident-storage">Tamper-Evident Storage</h2>
<p>You also need a tamper-evident storage solution for all sensitive electronics when you are away from home (laptops, external drives, USBs, phones, external keyboards and mice) — a laptop can be tampered with in ways that don't require removing the screws. Safes are often used to protect valuable items, but they can be bypassed in many ways, and some of these bypasses are difficult to detect (see <a href="https://www.anarsec.guide/posts/tamper/#appendix-cracking-safes">below</a>). It is not trivial or inexpensive to make a safe tamper-evident, if it can be done at all. </p>

<img src="https://www.anarsec.guide/posts/tamper/lentils.jpg">
</p>
<p>A better and cheaper solution is to implement <a href="https://dys2p.com/en/2021-12-tamper-evident-protection.html#kurzzeitige-lagerung">dys2p's guide</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When we need to leave a place and leave items or equipment behind, we can store them in a box that is transparent from all sides. Then we fill the box with our colorful mixture so that our devices are covered. The box should be stored in such a way that shocks or other factors do not change the mosaic. For example, the box can be positioned on a towel or piece of clothing on an object in such a way that this attenuates minor vibrations of the environment, but the box cannot slide off it.</p>
<p>For an overall comparison, we can photograph the box from all visible sides and store these photos on a device that is as secure as possible, send it to a trusted person via an encrypted and verified channel, or send it to another device of our own. The next step is to compare the found mosaic with the original one. The app Blink Comparison is ideal for this purpose.</p>
<p>To protect an object from damage, e.g., by staining or by the substance leaking into, say, the ports of a laptop, it can be wrapped in cling film, a bag, or otherwise.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Several colorful mixtures are described: <a href="https://dys2p.com/en/2021-12-tamper-evident-protection.html#rote-linsen-und-belugalinsen">red lentils &amp; beluga lentils</a>, <a href="https://dys2p.com/en/2021-12-tamper-evident-protection.html#gelbe-erbsen-und-wei%C3%9Fe-bohnen">yellow peas &amp; white beans</a>, etc. For a box that is transparent on all sides and fits a laptop, a small fish tank works well. For longer-term storage, <a href="https://dys2p.com/en/2021-12-tamper-evident-protection.html#laengerfristige-lagerung-oder-versand">vacuum seals</a> can be used. </p>
<p>This excerpt assumes that we take the cell phone with us, but <a href="https://www.anarsec.guide/posts/nophones/#do-you-really-need-a-phone">as discussed elsewhere</a>, this has its own security issues and is not recommended. So the smartphone we use to take a picture of the storage will have to stay in the house outside of the storage. <a href="https://www.anarsec.guide/posts/tamper/#physical-intrusion-detection">As discussed below</a>, we recommend that you get a cheap Android phone that only runs an app called Haven when you are out of the house. This device will stay out of storage anyway, so you can use it to take pictures of the storage. Alternatively, if you don't have a dedicated Haven phone but do have a <a href="https://www.anarsec.guide/posts/grapheneos/">GrapheneOS</a> device, you can use it to take photos of the storage and then hide it somewhere in your house while you're away. If you don't have a phone, you can use a camera. However, cameras don't have encryption, so it's much easier for an adversary to modify the photos and you won't be able to use the Blink Comparison app to facilitate the comparison. </p>
<h2 id="in-practice-1">In practice</h2>
<ul>
<li>Once you have placed the bagged electronic devices in the container and covered them with a colorful mixture, take photos using the Blink Comparison app. Optionally, send them to another device of your own (that is currently in storage) via <a href="https://www.anarsec.guide/posts/e2ee/#signal">Molly</a> or <a href="https://www.anarsec.guide/posts/e2ee#simplex-chat">SimpleX Chat</a>. Close Blink Comparison so that the storage is encrypted. 
<ul>
<li><em>If you are using a dedicated Haven phone (preferred)</em>: Set up Haven for physical intrusion detection before leaving, as described below. </li>
<li><em>If you are using a GrapheneOS phone</em>: Turn off the device and hide it somewhere. If the phone is found and the firmware or software is modified, Auditor will notify you. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When you return, use Blink Comparison to verify the mosaic with new photos. 
<ul>
<li>Optionally, if you sent the photos to yourself on Molly/SimpleX Chat, once your devices are out of storage you can verify that they don't differ from the reference photos saved in Blink Comparison. However, the Blink Comparison encryption makes it very unlikely that these reference photos were modified in your absence. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="tamper-evident-software-and-firmware">Tamper-Evident Software and Firmware</h2>
<p>So far, we have only looked at making hardware compromise tamper-evident. It is also possible to make software and firmware tamper-evident. This is required for "defense in depth" — to trust an electronic device, you must trust the hardware, firmware, and software. Software or firmware compromise <a href="https://www.anarsec.guide/posts/tails-best#2-running-tails-on-a-computer-with-a-compromised-bios-firmware-or-hardware">can occur remotely</a> (over the Internet) as well as with physical access, so it is especially important because the other measures won't necessarily detect it. Tamper-evident firmware is compatible with our <a href="https://www.anarsec.guide/recommendations">recommendations</a>: Qubes OS or Tails on laptops, or GrapheneOS on a smartphone. </p>
<p>For GrapheneOS, <a href="https://www.anarsec.guide/posts/grapheneos/#auditor">Auditor</a> is an app that allows you to be notified if firmware or operating system software has been tampered with — you will receive an email when Auditor performs a remote attestation. </p>
<p>For Tails or Qubes OS, <a href="https://osresearch.net/">Heads</a> can do the same before you enter your boot password (on <a href="https://osresearch.net/Prerequisites#supported-devices">supported devices</a>). However, installing Heads is advanced, though using it is not. Keep the Heads USB security dongle with you when you leave the house, and have a backup hidden at a trusted friend's house in case it ever falls into a puddle. For more information, see <a href="https://www.anarsec.guide/posts/tails-best/#to-mitigate-against-remote-attacks">Tails Best Practices</a>. </p>
<p>If Auditor or Heads ever detects tampering, you should immediately treat the device as untrusted. <a href="https://www.notrace.how/threat-library/mitigations/computer-and-mobile-forensics.html">Forensic analysis</a> may be able to reveal how the compromise occured, which helps to prevent it from happening again. You can get in touch with a service like <a href="https://accessnow.org/help">Access Now’s Digital Security Helpline</a>, though we recommend not sending them any personal data.</p>
<h2 id="physical-intrusion-detection">Physical Intrusion Detection</h2>
<p><a href="https://notrace.how/threat-library/mitigations/physical-intrusion-detection.html">Physical intrusion detection</a> is the process of detecting when an adversary enters or attempts to enter a space. As the Threat Library notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A video surveillance system that monitors a space can have the following characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>The cameras can be motion-activated and send you an alert if they are detected and tampered with.</li>
<li>The cameras can be positioned with the space entrances in their line of sight and/or in a discreet location.</li>
<li>To prevent the system from monitoring you while you are in the space, you can turn it on just before you leave the space and turn it off as soon as you return.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>We recommend employing physical intrusion detection in addition to all of the tamper-evident measures. That way, even if a covert house search doesn't interact with the tamper-evident storage (for example, because the goal is to install <a href="https://notrace.how/threat-library/techniques/covert-surveillance-devices.html">covert surveillance devices</a>), you can still find out about it. </p>
<p>Haven is an Android app developed by the Freedom of Press Foundation that uses the smartphone’s many sensors — microphone, motion detector, light detector, and cameras — to monitor the room for changes, and it logs everything it notices. Unfortunately Haven is currently unmaintained, remote notifications are <a href="https://github.com/guardianproject/haven/issues/454">broken</a>, and it is unreliable on many devices. </p>
<p>Until <a href="https://github.com/guardianproject/haven/issues/465">Haven is fully functional</a>, we recommend also using a video surveillance system so that you can receive remote notifications — this is important to protect against the local logs being modified by an intruder. Choose a model with privacy features (e.g. it doesn't function through the cloud) so that the police cannot easily learn the timing of your comings and goings from it. For instance, <a href="https://github.com/motioneye-project/motioneyeos/wiki/Features">motionEye OS</a> supports remote notifications for motion detection, but it requires Linux knowledge to set up. </p>
<h2 id="in-practice-2">In practice</h2>
<p>Haven should be used on a dedicated cheap Android device that is otherwise empty. An older <a href="https://www.privacyguides.org/android/#google-pixel">Pixel</a> is a good choice because it is cheap but has good cameras, which is important for both Haven and Blink Comparison — it may even <a href="https://grapheneos.org/faq#device-lifetime">still be supported by GrapheneOS</a>. Make sure that <a href="https://www.anarsec.guide/glossary/#full-disk-encryption-fde">full disk encryption</a> is enabled. If you have a smartphone in addition to the dedicated Haven phone, it should be turned off in the tamper-evident storage — if Haven was running on it instead and was discovered by the intruder, they would now have physical access to the device while it was turned on. </p>
<ul>
<li>Place the Haven smartphone in a location that has a line of sight to where an intruder would have to pass, such as a hallway that must be used to move between rooms or to access where the tamper-evident storage is located. It should be plugged in so the battery doesn't die; fairly long cables are available for this purpose. </li>
<li>Set a countdown to turn Haven on before you leave the house. The Haven app will log everything locally on the Android device. As mentioned above, sending remote notifications is currently broken.</li>
<li>Check the Haven log when you get home. </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping Up</h2>
<p>With the measures described above, any 'evil maid' would have to bypass:</p>
<ol>
<li>Physical intrusion detection, and</li>
<li>The tamper-evident storage, and</li>
<li>The tamper-evident glitter nail polish (for an attack that requires opening the laptop), or Heads/Auditor (for a software or firmware attack)</li>
</ol>
<p>These layers are all important, although they may seem redundant. The expertise and cost required to successfully execute the attack increases significantly with each layer, making it much less likely that an adversary will attempt it in the first place. The best practice is to <a href="https://www.anarsec.guide/posts/tails-best/#to-mitigate-against-physical-attacks">obtain a fresh device in such a way that it cannot be intercepted</a>, and then consistently implement all of these layers from the beginning. </p>
<h2 id="in-practice-3">In practice</h2>
<p>To summarize, take the following measures every time you leave the house with no one home for a significant amount of time: </p>
<ol>
<li>Put the turned-off devices into tamper-evident storage </li>
<li>Take the necessary photos </li>
<li>Activate Haven </li>
</ol>
<p>This may sound tedious, but it can be done in less than a minute if you leave unused devices in storage. When you get home: </p>
<ol>
<li>Start by checking the Haven log </li>
<li>Next, verify the tamper-evident storage with Blink Comparison</li>
</ol>
<p>Laptop screws can be verified when something suspicious happens. Neither Heads nor Auditor require much effort to use properly once set up; Auditor runs without interaction and Heads becomes part of your boot process. </p>

<p><strong>Do “outline speedrunning”:</strong> <strong>Recursively <span>outline</span> an MVP, <span>speedrun</span> filling it in</strong>,<strong> and <span>only then</span> go back and perfect.</strong></p>







<p>This is a ~10x speed up over the ‘loading-bar’ style (more on that below)</p>







<p>Don’t just read this article and move on. Go out and do this for the very next thing you make so you can get in the habit of doing it.</p>







<p><em>(btw, here, speedrunning just means doing something as fast as possible)</em></p>







<h5>Outline speedrunning algorithm:</h5>



<p>1. Make an outline of the project</p>







<p>2. For each item in the outline, make an outline. Do this recursively until the items are small</p>







<p>3. Fill in each item as fast as possible</p>



<ul>
<li>You’ll get more momentum by speedrunning it, which feels great, and will make you even more productive</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>DO NOT PERFECT AS YOU GO</strong>. This is a huge and common mistake.</li>
</ul>



<p>4. Finally, once completely done, go back and perfect</p>



<ul>
<li>Color the title text, figure out if buttons should have 5% or 6% border radius, etc</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>Since you’re done, you’ll be less stressed, have a much clearer mind, and design your project better</li>



<li><em>And hey, you’ll enjoy the whole process more, and end up making more things over the long run, causing you to learn/grow more</em></li>
</ul>







<h6>CRITICAL requirements for outline speedrunning:</h6>



<ul>
<li>outline recursively</li>



<li>speedrun</li>



<li><strong><span>DO NOT PERFECT ANYTHING UNTIL DONE</span></strong></li>
</ul>



<h5>Outlining is a fundamental of building</h5>



<p>Outline speedrunning may seem basic. That’s because it is. <em>Planning</em> is a fundamental of <em>doing</em>, and <em>outlining</em> is a fundamental of <em>planning</em>.</p>







<p><strong>Much of becoming really efficient is about getting extremely cracked at the fundamentals (many of which you probably mistakenly dismiss).</strong></p>







<p><em>This is recursive btw, because fundamentals typically have fundamentals.</em></p>



<figure><video autoplay="" controls="" loop="" muted="" src="https://learnhowtolearn.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/output-onlinegiftools.webm" playsinline=""></video><figcaption><em>its conceptual building blocks all the way </em>down</figcaption></figure>



<p>I knew about outlining since I was little but didn’t do it until I was 20. After I started it took time to get cracked at outlining and refine it into outline speedrunning.</p>







<p><strong>There is immense amounts of wisdom/utility/alpha in reevaluating any fundamentals that your mind dismisses as unimportant. Much improvement in any performance-based field comes from fixing these misevaluations.</strong></p>







<p>You may already do outline speedrunning. If you’re not, it’s a 10x speedup over the classic ‘loading bar’ style.</p>







<p><em>Generally, the best speedups come from<em> improving your algorithm</em>s, rather than ramming your head into the task harder</em>.</p>







<h4>Examples</h4>



<h5>Write large docs faster</h5>



<figure><video controls="" muted="" src="https://learnhowtolearn.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/output-1.webm" playsinline=""></video><figcaption><em>My attempt at speedrunning each method for a minute or so. left: loading-bar. right: outline speedrunning</em>.</figcaption></figure>



<h6><strong>Loading-bar writing:</strong></h6>



<p>Common mistake: ‘loading bar writing’ – starting at the beginning of the document and writing sentence by sentence, like a loading bar going through the document.</p>



<figure><video autoplay="" controls="" loop="" muted="" src="https://learnhowtolearn.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/loadingbar.webm" playsinline=""></video></figure>



<p>I wrote like this until I was ~20. It made me hate writing.</p>







<p>Now writing is easy and quick. My writing (and at the time, grades) improved substantially because I could allocate more time towards quality with a clearer, less stressed mind.</p>







<h6><strong>Outline speedrunning writing:</strong></h6>



<p>1 Get topic to write about</p>



<ul>
<li>(optional) brainstorm the general plot of the paper</li>
</ul>



<p>2 quickly write the outline (sections)</p>



<p>3 repeat 2 for each section recursively, until the lowest-level sections are small enough to not need outlines</p>



<p>4 speedrun (without caring about quality AT ALL) filling in each outline (starting at the lowest level) until the whole doc is filled out</p>



<p>5 Enjoy the feeling of being 90% done while you go back and perfect the doc, color the title text, add pictures, etc (the fun part!)</p>







<p>Do this to effortlessly improve both speed and quality of writing.</p>











<h4>Program faster</h4>



<p>Going from loading-bar to outline speedrunning significantly speeds up programming</p>







<h5><strong>Outline speedrunning</strong> for<strong> programming:</strong></h5>



<p>1 Figure out what the main purpose/function of your program is.</p>



<p>2 Break the program into parts grouped by functionality.</p>



<p>3 repeat steps 1-2 for each part, unless it is very small.</p>



<p>4 implement the components starting with the lowest-level</p>







<p><span>Example (simplified version of a data pipeline I built):</span></p>



<p>Idea: Data pipeline application</p>



<p>1 Main purpose: collect tons of data and analyze/store it</p>



<p>2 Breaking it down into components:</p>



<ul>
<li>data collecting component</li>



<li>data cleaning/formatting component</li>



<li>data analysis component</li>



<li>data storage component</li>
</ul>



<figure><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="647" src="https://7vaf67.p3cdn1.secureserver.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-1024x647.png" alt="" srcset="https://7vaf67.p3cdn1.secureserver.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-1024x647.png 1024w, https://7vaf67.p3cdn1.secureserver.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-300x190.png 300w, https://7vaf67.p3cdn1.secureserver.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-768x485.png 768w, https://7vaf67.p3cdn1.secureserver.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image.png 1174w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>3 repeat step 2 for each part. Breaking down the data collecting component into subcomponents:</p>



<ul>
<li>Component: list of data collection methods (web scraping, simulation data, tool measurement data, etc)</li>



<li>Component to get user input for choice of data collection method</li>



<li>Component to execute chosen data collection methods</li>



<li>Component to send collected data to storage</li>
</ul>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="915" height="604" src="https://7vaf67.p3cdn1.secureserver.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://7vaf67.p3cdn1.secureserver.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-1.png 915w, https://7vaf67.p3cdn1.secureserver.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-1-300x198.png 300w, https://7vaf67.p3cdn1.secureserver.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-1-768x507.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 915px) 100vw, 915px"></figure>



<p>3 repeat step 2 for each other component and subcomponent, unless they are small</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="755" height="430" src="https://7vaf67.p3cdn1.secureserver.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://7vaf67.p3cdn1.secureserver.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-2.png 755w, https://7vaf67.p3cdn1.secureserver.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-2-300x171.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 755px) 100vw, 755px"></figure>







<p>This can be done on a whiteboard, drawn on paper, in your head (can be subpar) or outlined like an essay. The most efficient medium depends on your project. You’ll get a feel for what works best by just practicing this.</p>

<p>The Space Shuttle contained a bulky printer so the astronauts could
receive procedures, mission plans, weather reports, crew activity plans, and other documents.
Needed for the first Shuttle launch in 1981, this printer was designed in just 7 months, built around an Army communications terminal.
Unlike modern printers, the Shuttle's printer contains a spinning metal drum with raised characters, allowing it to rapidly print a line at a time.</p>

<p>This printer is known as the Space Shuttle Interim Teleprinter System.<span id="fnref:refs"><a href="#fn:refs">1</a></span>
As the name "Interim" suggests, this printer was intended as a stop-gap measure, operating for a few flights until a better printer was operational.
However, the teleprinter proved to be more reliable than its replacement, so it remained in use as a backup for over 50 flights, often printing thousands of lines per flight.
This didn't come cheap: with a Shuttle flight costing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Space_Shuttle_program">$27,000 per pound</a>, putting the 59-pound teleprinter in space cost over $1.5 million per flight.</p>

<p>We obtained access to a Shuttle teleprinter (probably a development system that remained on the ground) and wanted to put it into operation.
I had to reverse engineer three of the boards inside the printer to determine the data format the printer accepted: serial data encoded into audio.
But after analyzing the printer and performing a lot of maintenance, we succeeded in getting the printer to print.
In this article, I'll describe the Shuttle's Interim Teleprinter, explain its circuitry and drum-based printing mechanism, and show it in operation.</p>
<h2>History of the Shuttle's Interim Teleprinter</h2>
<p>The motivation for the teleprinter goes back to the Apollo program. During Apollo missions, the only way to send information to the astronauts was by talking to them over the
radio and having the astronauts write down the data.
NASA decided that the Space Shuttle should include a mechanism to send text and images to the astronauts, a 78-pound, high-tech fax machine called the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoIf3y73j6g">Uplink Text &amp; Graphics System</a> (TAGS).
A high-resolution grayscale image was sent to the Shuttle as a digital data stream.
Onboard the Shuttle, a squat CRT displayed the image one line at a time and a fiber-optic faceplate transferred each line to light-sensitive silver emulsion paper.
The paper was developed by passing it over a hot roller at 260ºF for 25 seconds, creating a permanent image.</p>
<p>The one flaw in this plan was that sending the digital image to the Shuttle required the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRS), which due to delays wouldn't be ready until the sixth Shuttle flight.
(The TDRS was a space-based replacement for the worldwide network of ground stations that was used during Apollo.)
As a result, NASA decided just seven months before the first Shuttle launch that they needed an interim system "for transmission of real-time, flight-plan changes and other operational data to the crew."<span id="fnref:TUMMS"><a href="#fn:TUMMS">2</a></span></p>
<p>The Shuttle teleprinter is the result of this rushed effort to create a printer that could work over the existing audio channel rather than the digital TDRS satellite.
Due to the time pressure, the Shuttle teleprinter needed to be based on an off-the-shelf printer.
Thermal and electrostatic printers were rejected due to toxicity and flammability problems. (The Shuttle teleprinter used a roll of yellowish paper, which required a NASA waiver due to
its flammability, a concern ever since the Apollo-1 disaster).</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/shuttle-printer/anugc-74.png"><img alt="The AN/UGC-74 military communications terminal. This terminal was developed by the Army but also used by the Navy and Air Force.

This terminal was developed by the Army but also used by the Navy and Air Force. Image from the Operator's Manual, TM 11-5815-602-10.</p>
<p>The decision was made to use a military communications terminal, the
the AN/UCG-74<span id="fnref:model"><a href="#fn:model">3</a></span> "<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=mHZdEoKxLC4C&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;pg=PA577#v=onepage&amp;q=%22tactical%20teletype%22&amp;f=false">Tactical Teletype</a>".
The terminal's interfacing was very flexible, supporting serial data in either ASCII or Baudot format, with multiple configurations and baud rates (up to 1200 baud), using either a current-loop or voltage signals.
The military terminal supported two-way communication, so it had a keyboard.
Remarkably, the terminal also implemented a word processor, controlled by a Motorola 6800 microprocessor (ancestor of the famous MOS 6502). 
The word processor allowed messages to be composed offline, minimizing the radio transmission time, which was important in a hostile environment.
As will be seen, this 100-pound military system required many large changes to be usable on the Space Shuttle, most visibly removing the keyboard.</p>
<h2>The printing mechanism</h2>
<p>The teleprinter uses a spinning drum with raised characters, shown below.<span id="fnref:chain"><a href="#fn:chain">4</a></span>
To print a character, the printer fires a hammer, forcing the inked ribbon and paper against the
raised character on the drum.
The drum is 80 characters wide, matching the line length, and there are 80 corresponding hammers, one for each print position.
The drum has 64 printable characters, wrapped around each position of the drum.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/shuttle-printer/drum.jpg"><img alt="The printer's drum rotating drum has 64 raised characters in each column. The characters spiral around the drum and are in reverse order, minimizing the chance that a line will fire all the hammers near-simultaneously." height="256" src="https://static.righto.com/images/shuttle-printer/drum-w600.jpg" title="The printer's drum rotating drum has 64 raised characters in each column. The characters spiral around the drum and are in reverse order, minimizing the chance that a line will fire all the hammers near-simultaneously." width="600"></a></p><p>The printer's drum rotating drum has 64 raised characters in each column. The characters spiral around the drum and are in reverse order, minimizing the chance that a line will fire all the hammers near-simultaneously.</p>
<p>The printer prints a line at a time, not instantaneously, but during each revolution of the drum.
When the drum makes one complete revolution, each of the 64 characters passes by each print position once.
Printing requires precise timing of the hammers to strike the right character on the drum as it whizzes by.
The printer control circuitry triggers each hammer at the proper time, when the desired character on the drum is lined up with the hammer, producing the desired text.<span id="fnref:timing"><a href="#fn:timing">5</a></span></p>
<p>The character set is slightly different between the military printer and the Shuttle printer.
The military drum had 64 ASCII characters (upper-case letters only, numbers, and special characters).
The drum doesn't contain an explicit space character, since nothing is printed for a space. In its place, the drum has a diamond "◊", used as a special character to indicate a parity error or
other error.
The drum for the Shuttle teleprinter replaces 10 ASCII special characters with symbols that are more useful to the Shuttle, such as Greek letters for angles.
Specifically, the characters <code>;@[\]^!"#$</code> are replaced by <code>θ✓‾↑↓~αβΔϕ</code>.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/shuttle-printer/hammers.jpg"><img alt="With the teleprinter disassembled, the 20 hammer cards are visible at the front. Two hammer driver cards are to the right of the hammer cards." height="292" src="https://static.righto.com/images/shuttle-printer/hammers-w500.jpg" title="With the teleprinter disassembled, the 20 hammer cards are visible at the front. Two hammer driver cards are to the right of the hammer cards." width="500"></a></p><p>With the teleprinter disassembled, the 20 hammer cards are visible at the front. Two hammer driver cards are to the right of the hammer cards.</p>
<p>The video below shows a closeup of the hammers as they strike the paper to print text.
The text is the teleprinter's built-in test message: "THE LAZY YELLOW DOG WAS CAUGHT BY THE SLOW RED FOX AS HE LAY SLEEPING IN THE SUN".
This test message is based on the traditional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_quick_brown_fox_jumps_over_the_lazy_dog">quick brown fox...</a>, which is a pangram, containing all
26 letters, but
the teleprinter's test sentence is missing J, K, M, Q, and V.
However, the test message is exactly 80 characters long and replaces spaces with the diamond "◊", so it is effective for verifying that all 80 columns work.</p>

<h2>The electronics</h2>
<p>The photo below shows the circuitry inside the teleprinter, looking down from above.
At the left are the three interface boards, custom boards that demodulate the incoming audio signal.
In front of the interface boards are large inductors to filter the incoming power. Hidden beneath them, a solid-state relay controls the power to the rest of the printer, implementing
the low-power standby mode.
In the middle, the blue board is the surprisingly complex switching power supply, mounted on a thick metal plate for cooling.
Normally, the large roll of paper is mounted above the power supply board.
At the right, four large circuit boards implement the main logic of the printer: a printer driver board, a communications board, a memory board, and the processor board.
The rotating drum is protected by the perforated black metal grill at the front.</p>

<h3>The demodulator boards</h3>
<p>The original military teleprinter received data as a serial bitstream.
However, on the Space Shuttle, data was encoded as frequencies on the audio link.
Three custom boards were constructed to demodulate the audio data so the rest of the printer could handle it.
These boards also performed Shuttle-specific tasks such as powering up the printer when a message comes in, and then returning the printer to
standby mode.
I reverse-engineered these boards to determine how they work and to determine the data encoding. (Schematics are in the footnotes.<span id="fnref:schematics"><a href="#fn:schematics">7</a></span>)
In this section, I'll discuss these three boards, which are on the left side of the printer.</p>
<p>To summarize, the serial bitstream is encoded with Frequency Shift Keying, with a 0 represented by 3600 Hz and a 1 represented by 7200 Hz.<span id="fnref:frequency"><a href="#fn:frequency">6</a></span> The serial data is
transmitted at 600 baud, even parity, one stop bit.
The demodulation process first converts the input audio to a digital signal by thresholding it. (That is, the input sine wave is converted to a square wave.)
The digital signal is autocorrelated to distinguish the 3600 Hz and 7200 Hz signals, recovering the underlying serial data.
This signal is passed to the printer's logic boards (part of the original military teleprinter), which convert the serial signal to ASCII bytes and prints them.</p>
<p>Signal processing starts with the "FSK input" board, shown below. First, it amplifies the input audio signal.
(The two large resistors provide a 600 Ω load for the audio input.)
Next, a 900 Hz high-pass filter eliminates low-frequency noise.
(The filter is implemented by a two-stage <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sallen%E2%80%93Key_topology">Sallen-Key</a> topology.)</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/shuttle-printer/input-board.jpg"><img alt="The input board." height="419" src="https://static.righto.com/images/shuttle-printer/input-board-w500.jpg" title="The input board." width="500"></a></p><p>The input board.</p>
<p>The signal bounces from board to board, going to the 
"output FSK demod" board next. This board has a carrier-detect circuit that turns on the rest of the printer if it detects an input signal.
This allows the printer to sit idle until it receives a signal from Earth.
This board also applies the threshold to the signal to turn it into a digital waveform, which goes to the "control" board.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/shuttle-printer/output-board.jpg"><img alt="The output board." height="393" src="https://static.righto.com/images/shuttle-printer/output-board-w500.jpg" title="The output board." width="500"></a></p><p>The output board.</p>
<p>The output board also holds the 5-volt and 12-volt linear regulators that power the three boards; these are the metal-can ICs at the bottom of the board.
To reduce the load on the regulators, two large resistors drop the input voltage (28 volts) to a lower level
before it is regulated.</p>
<p>The control board holds the FSK decoder, an interesting circuit that converts the two FSK frequencies to binary by implementing a digital auto-correlator.
It uses a 64-bit shift register to delay the digital input by 139 µs.
The input and the delayed input are XOR'd together, generating a result that depends on the frequency.
A 7200 Hz signal repeats every 139 µs, so the input and the delayed input match, yielding 0 from the XOR.
However, a 3600 Hz square wave switches state every 139 µs, so the two XOR inputs will always differ, resulting in a 1 output.
Thus, the circuit cleanly distinguishes between a 3600 Hz input and a 7200 Hz input.
(The XOR output is opposite from the final value since it gets inverted later.)</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/shuttle-printer/control-board.jpg"><img alt="The control board." height="436" src="https://static.righto.com/images/shuttle-printer/control-board-w500.jpg" title="The control board." width="500"></a></p><p>The control board.</p>
<p>The digital demodulator avoids some of the problems of an analog FSK demodulator. It is not sensitive to signal levels, since the signal is converted to digital.
The digital demodulator is also not sensitive to harmonics, which can cause problems with analog demodulators.
Finally, it doesn't require the carefully-tuned filters of an analog circuit.</p>
<p>The demodulated signal passes from the control board back to the output board.
This board applies a 400 Hz low-pass filter and then a threshold to convert the signal back to binary.
If the input frequencies are not exact, the demodulator will produce the correct 0 or 1 value over most of the waveform, but there will be glitches at the edges.
The low-pass filter removes these glitches.
(You might be concerned that a 600-baud signal would be wiped out by a 400 Hz low-pass filter. However, the worst case signal (alternating 0's and 1's) would be 300 Hz
because it takes two bits to make one cycle, so the filter has plenty of margin.)
Next, the board blocks the signal unless a carrier is detected.
This ensures that random noise isn't demodulated and printed.
Finally, the serial binary signal leaves the custom Shuttle boards and goes to the teleprinter's communication board, part of the standard teleprinter.</p>
<p>I noticed two unusual things about these boards. First, they have some modifications: "bodge" wires and added components. Second, the boards are not conformal coated, which
is unusual for aerospace boards.
(The four logic cards, in comparison, are protected with conformal coating.)
My hypothesis is that these boards were development boards, early in the design process of the Shuttle teleprinter, so they were modified as the design changed.
The teleprinter is also marked "Not for flight", which supports this theory.</p>

Although the description says this is the Text &amp; Graphics System, it is clearly the Interim Teleprinter.</p>
<h2>The logic cards</h2>
<p>The military teleprinter contained four logic circuit cards: a CPU card, a memory card, a communications card, and a print control card, mounted at the right rear of the teleprinter.
These cards are used unchanged in the Shuttle teleprinter.</p>
<p>The circuitry is more complex than you might expect, with four large cards full of ICs. There are several reasons for this.
First, the cards use 1970s microprocessor technology, so it takes a lot of circuitry to do anything. In particular, many
simple 7400-series logic chips perform "glue" functions: decoding addresses, buffering data, latching signals, and so forth.
Moreover, a drum printer is inherently complicated, since 80 hammers must be driven at the right time based on the desired characters.
Third, the teleprinter is very flexible, supporting multiple signal levels and two character formats (ASCII and Baudot).
Most surprisingly, the teleprinter implements a word processor, allowing messages to be composed and edited offline. 
Of course, since the Shuttle's teleprinter is only used to receive data, and doesn't even have a keyboard, the word processor feature is entirely useless.</p>
<h3>The CPU card</h3>
<p>The CPU card holds the microprocessor that controls the teleprinter.
Its most important function is to convert a line of ASCII characters into print drum codes. These codes are stored in memory for use by the print control card.
The CPU also implements configuration and self-test functions.</p>
<p>The diagram below shows some of the main components.
The CPU card contains a Motorola 6800 CPU, 4 kilobytes of memory, and a ROM that holds its program code.<span id="fnref:block-diagram"><a href="#fn:block-diagram">8</a></span>
Inconveniently, all the IC part numbers are military numbers so it takes some investigation to determine what a part really is.
The MC6822 is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_Interface_Adapter">Peripheral Interface Adapter</a>, a Motorola chip that provides two parallel I/O ports.
This chip is used on three of the cards to support a variety of I/O tasks. On the CPU card, the I/O ports
drive eight status lamps (most of which were removed for the Shuttle teleprinter) as well as internal status signals such as "paper low" or "keyboard present" and
the baud rate setting input.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/shuttle-printer/cpu-labeled.jpg"><img alt="The CPU card is centered around a Motorola 6800 microprocessor." height="517" src="https://static.righto.com/images/shuttle-printer/cpu-labeled-w700.jpg" title="The CPU card is centered around a Motorola 6800 microprocessor." width="700"></a></p><p>The CPU card is centered around a Motorola 6800 microprocessor.</p>
<h3>The print control card</h3>
<p>In a sense, the print control card is the heart of the printer, since it causes characters to be printed by firing hammers against the rotating drum.
As the drum goes through one revolution, all 64 characters will spin past each of the 80 print positions. By firing hammers at the exact time, the card prints a line of text.<span id="fnref:revolution"><a href="#fn:revolution">9</a></span>
In more detail, for each row on the drum, the printer card scans through the 80-character memory buffer using Direct Memory Access (DMA).
If the value in memory matches the current drum row number, the hammer is fired.
Note that the hammers don't fire simultaneously, but in sequence as memory is scanned.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/shuttle-printer/printer-diagram.jpg"><img alt="This diagram shows how the print control board interacts with the rest of the system. From the Maintenance manual, TM 11-5815-602-24." height="574" src="https://static.righto.com/images/shuttle-printer/printer-diagram-w450.jpg" title="This diagram shows how the print control board interacts with the rest of the system. From the Maintenance manual, TM 11-5815-602-24." width="450"></a></p><p>This diagram shows how the print control board interacts with the rest of the system. From the <a href="https://www.radionerds.com/images/e/e0/TM_11-5815-602-24.pdf">Maintenance manual</a>, TM 11-5815-602-24.</p>
<p>The diagram above shows the interaction between the drum, the print control card, and the 80 hammers.
The hammers are implemented on 20 print hammer cards, each with 4 hammers.
Electrically, the hammers are arranged in a matrix. One wire out of 20 (S1-S20) selects the hammer board, the group of four. Another wire selects one of four hammers (Col 1-4).
This approach simplifies the electronics, since 20 + 4 driver circuits and wires are used, rather than 80 (one for each column).
The print control card is synchronized to the drum by two photo-transistor sensors that detect the drum's position. One sensor is triggered on each row, while the other sensor
triggers once per revolution.</p>
<p>The print control card is shown below, with the main functional blocks labeled.
The large purple-and-gold chip is the PIA, the same I/O chip that appeared on the CPU card. It handles a variety of signals such as the self-test request, paper out, and the drum stop signal.
The mode control logic generates timing signals depending on the printer's mode.
The data compare logic increments the row counter on each drum pulse, and compares the row counter to the value read from memory.<span id="fnref:compare"><a href="#fn:compare">10</a></span>
The hammer driver circuitry on the left selects one of the 20 hammer cards, while the hammer driver circuitry on the right selects one of four hammers.
The ribbon circuitry raises and lowers the ribbon so the ribbon doesn't block the text when the printer is idle.
The line feed circuitry advances the paper for a line feed operation.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/shuttle-printer/print-labeled.jpg"><img alt="The print control card prints data by driving the hammers." height="376" src="https://static.righto.com/images/shuttle-printer/print-labeled-w600.jpg" title="The print control card prints data by driving the hammers." width="600"></a></p><p>The print control card prints data by driving the hammers.</p>
<p>The photo below shows one of the hammer cards, with four hammers.
Each hammer has an electromagnet that pulls a lever, rotating the hammer wheel, and causing the hammer to strike the paper.
(The hammers themselves are in the upper right of the photo.)
A screw adjustment controls the distance between each hammer and the paper, allowing precise adjustment of the timing.
(Marc had to carefully adjust all the hammers to make the print quality readable.)</p>

<h3>The communication card</h3>
<p>The communication card handles the teleprinter's serial data input.
The key chip is the 8251A, a USART (Universal Synchronous/Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter). This complex chip performs the conversion between the
serial data stream and the bytes that the processor uses.
(Note that the military teleprinter both sent and received serial data, while the Shuttle teleprinter only receives data.)
The chip has a few support chips, labeled "UART" in the diagram below.
The board has another Peripheral Interface Adapter chip, providing two I/O ports. These ports have functions such as reading the serial line settings
(ASCII vs. Baudot, odd or even parity, number of stop bits, and current loop levels).</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/shuttle-printer/comm-labeled.jpg"><img alt="The communication card converts the serial input to parallel byte data." height="428" src="https://static.righto.com/images/shuttle-printer/comm-labeled-w600.jpg" title="The communication card converts the serial input to parallel byte data." width="600"></a></p><p>The communication card converts the serial input to parallel byte data.</p>
<p>The board also has circuitry to generate the clock pulses for the selected baud rate.
The mode circuitry handles various phases of transmit/receive. The filter/demod circuitry
handles different input types, digitally filtering and demodulating as necessary.<span id="fnref:filter"><a href="#fn:filter">11</a></span></p>
<h3>The memory card</h3>
<p>The memory card supports the word-processing feature. It provides additional RAM to hold the text buffer as well as the ROM holding the software for editing.
The 16 DRAM chips on the left (MK4027) provide 8 KB of RAM while the two ROM chips on the right provide 8K of ROM.
The chips in the middle to the right of the resistors split the 12 address bits into row and column addresses as required by the RAM chips. The address signals go through the numerous 24 Ω resistors in the middle; I don't know why.
According to the manual, the printer operates fine without this card, except without the word processor. Since the word processor was irrelevant to the Shuttle, I
wonder why this card wasn't removed to reduce weight.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/shuttle-printer/memory-board.jpg"><img alt="The memory card has additional RAM and ROM to support the word processing feature." height="377" src="https://static.righto.com/images/shuttle-printer/memory-board-w600.jpg" title="The memory card has additional RAM and ROM to support the word processing feature." width="600"></a></p><p>The memory card has additional RAM and ROM to support the word processing feature.</p>
<h2>The power supply</h2>
<p>The power supply board (shown earlier) implements separate power supplies for different parts of the printer.<span id="fnref:power-supply"><a href="#fn:power-supply">12</a></span>
The supplies are implemented as switching power supplies, which were not as common at the time as now.
The microprocessor supply provides +5V, +12V, and -5V, voltages required by memory chips in the 1970s.
A separate switching power supply provides +5V, -8.6V, and +8.6V for the keyboard, dustcover, and interface module, components that were removed for the Shuttle teleprinter.
Another supply powers the printer's status lamps.</p>
<p>The drum motor supply is important because its voltage is regulated to control the rotational speed of the drum.
A sensor on the drum provides a feedback pulse for each row on the drum.  (I think the drum speed is 868 RPM.)
These pulses control the drum motor's switching supply.
If the drum spins too slowly, the voltage is increased, and similarly if it spins too fast.</p>
<p>The hammers have an unusual constant-current power supply.
When the printer is active, this power supply generates +18 V.
However, the power supply is designed to use a constant current of 600 mA regardless of the hammer activity. A capacitor provides a reservoir of power that is filled by the constant current. If the hammers are using less current, the excess current is bled off through a resistor.
The purpose of this is "to mask printing intelligence during periods of message traffic."
In other words, if you used a teleprinter in the embassy in Moscow, for instance, spies could monitor power transients to see when hammers are firing, and perhaps figure out what is
being printed.
By keeping the current constant, this source of intelligence is blocked.
Of course, this feature is useless on the Space Shuttle and only wastes power.</p>
<p>The military teleprinter accepted multiple input voltages: 22-30 VDC, 115 VAC, or 230 VAC, along with a 12 VDC battery backup.
The transformers and diodes to support these voltages were part of the interface module that was removed for the Shuttle teleprinter.
Instead, the Shuttle teleprinter is powered by 28 VDC.</p>
<h2>Mechanical changes</h2>
<p>The military teleprinter underwent significant mechanical changes to make it suitable for the Shuttle.
These changes reduced its weight from 100 pounds to 59 pounds.
The most visible change to the printer is the removal of the keyboard.
The entire front section of the printer was replaced, removing the controls that were not needed in the Shuttle.<span id="fnref:changes"><a href="#fn:changes">13</a></span>
The rugged frame of the original printer was replaced with a lighter-weight (but still substantial) frame. Horizontal rails were added to the frame to support the printer in
the Shuttle locker.</p>
<p>The photo below shows the front of the Shuttle teleprinter.
While the military teleprinter had numerous lights and switches on the front, the Shuttle teleprinter has just two lights and four switches.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/shuttle-printer/front.jpg"><img alt="Front view of the Shuttle teleprinter.

The bar across the middle holds a paper cutter for removing the output." width="600"></a></p><p>Front view of the Shuttle teleprinter. The bar across the middle holds a paper cutter for removing the output.</p>
<p>NASA was concerned that the temperature of the teleprinter could become hazardous to the astronauts.
To mitigate this danger, the teleprinter had a large heat-sensitive warning sticker.
The yellow sticker on the left of the teleprinter changes color and displays an image if it heats up: it shows a <a href="https://amzn.to/3WtpqIF">bandaged hand</a> and the word "HOT".
Above it is an "Omegalabel" temperature monitoring sticker that shows the highest temperature the device reached.
There are more of these stickers inside the teleprinter on various motors.</p>
<h2>The Interim Teleprinter inside the Space Shuttle</h2>
<p>The teleprinter was too large to be mounted on the flight deck, so it was mounted in a storage locker on the middeck, one level lower.
The photo below shows the location of the locker that held the teleprinter (although the teleprinter was not present in this photo), looking backward (aft) toward the airlock.
The locker is denoted MA9F, indicating Mid-deck Aft, position 9F (<a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/19850018529/downloads/19850018529.pdf">details</a>), in the back on the right
side of the Shuttle.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/shuttle-printer/ma9fa.jpg"><img alt="This photo shows the locker that held the teleprinter.

<p>The teleprinter was noisy because of its impact printing; even with it in a locker, the sound outside was 69.5 dB. The solution was to soundproof the locker with acoustic insulation.
Various insulating materials were tested until one was found that passed the toxicity requirements. Another flammability waiver was required for the insulation.</p>
<p>Putting the teleprinter in an insulated locker without cooling caused another problem: overheating. The military teleprinter used 34 watts even while idle, which would cause the
printer to become dangerously hot after just 6 orbits.
The printer was redesigned to support a standby mode that used just 1 watt. When a signal from Earth was detected, the printer would power up while in use, and then return to
standby mode.
A circuit was added to send a tone back to Earth when the printer was activated, reassuring Mission Control that the printer had switched out of standby mode.
These circuits were on the three custom Shuttle boards described earlier.</p>
<p>Putting the teleprinter in a locker made cabling difficult.
The solution was a panel on the locker door with connectors for power and audio. 
The panel has a power switch and light as well as a light to indicate that a message has been received.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/shuttle-printer/teleprinter-panel.jpg"><img alt="The panel on the outside of the locker, used for connection to the teleprinter.

These cables went across the back of the Shuttle to the left side, where they went up to the flight deck;
the cable routing was performed before launch.<span id="fnref:cables"><a href="#fn:cables">14</a></span>

<p>The teleprinter cables connect to the shuttle at panel A15 on the

this is what you would see.</p>

<p>The audio cable from the teleprinter went to the Payload Specialist communication connection on panel A15, while the power cable went to the DC power connection right below.
During launch, this audio connection was needed for crew communication, so the teleprinter was plugged in after launch and the audio settings were reconfigured on panel L9.
A cue card was placed above panel L9 with instructions on the teleprinter. <!-- See Shuttle Crew Operations Manual p 3.2-2 --></p>
<h2>The teleprinter's replacements</h2>
<p>The Shuttle teleprinter was supposed to be used for a short time until the Uplink Text and Graphics System (TAGS) entered service, but things didn't work out that way.
TAGS, described earlier, was the fax-like system that could receive grayscale images, but it depended on the TDRS satellites with their support for digital data.
The first TDRS satellite was launched by the sixth shuttle flight, STS-6 (1983).
This allowed the use of TAGS on STS-7, but the printer promptly <a href="https://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/index.php?topic=35731.440">jammed</a>.<span id="fnref:tags"><a href="#fn:tags">15</a></span>
TAGS had constant problems with jamming;
on <a href="https://gandalfddi.z19.web.core.windows.net/Shuttle/JSC-19413%20-%20Shuttle%20flight%20data%20and%20in-flight%20anomaly%20list.%20STS-1-STS-50,%20STS-52-STS-56%20RevT%2019960001128.pdf#page=468">STS-35</a>, the printer jammed and then the unjamming tool broke.
Due to the unreliability of the TAGS, the Interim Teleprinter was kept in service as a backup device.
TAGS was mounted on a dual cold plate in avionics bay 3 of the crew compartment middeck (<a href="https://historycollection.jsc.nasa.gov/JSCHistoryPortal/history/shuttle_pk/mrk/FLIGHT_033-STS-032_MRK.pdf">details</a>), on the other side of the airlock from the teleprinter.</p>

<p>After a decade, another printer, the <a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20110015565/downloads/20110015565.pdf#page=15">Thermal Impulse Printer System</a> (TIPS) was put into service,
probably on flight STS-56 in 1993.
Once TIPS proved its reliability, it <a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/19940023718/downloads/19940023718.pdf#page=7">replaced</a> both the teleprinter and the
Text and Graphics System (TAGS).
The TIPS printer was installed in mid-deck locker MF28E; the F indicates the locker was on the forward wall, not the aft wall that held the Interim Teleprinter.
As a backup for the TIPS, the Shuttle flew with a second TIPS.</p>

behind the TIPS thermal printer was NASA's desire to use more commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) equipment instead of expensive custom equipment.
The TIPS printer is the Raytheon TDU-850 printer (below), a commercial product that sold for <a href="https://archive.org/details/electronics-1987_04_02/page/117/mode/1up">$4950</a>. A custom communication interface board inside the printer provided the interface
between the printer and the Shuttle's S-Band and Ku-Band communications systems.
This interface also allowed astronauts to use the TIPS as a printer for an onboard personal computer.</p>

<h2>The teleprinter, operational</h2>
<p>We succeeded in making the Shuttle teleprinter operational.
The printer had many mechanical problems, mainly because the rubber rollers had turned to liquid and gummed up the mechanism.
Marc disassembled the printer, carefully cleaned the mechanism, and realigned everything.
I won't discuss the restoration process here since there will be a video on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/CuriousMarc">CuriousMarc's channel</a>.
We were able to send FSK-modulated data to the printer and it was printed successfully, as shown below.</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EDeL15amsus?si=XoMS5TzSeTItz4sl" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>At first, I thought that the Shuttle's Interim Teleprinter was a terrible design. It's absurdly heavy and was in danger of overheating.
Although the design started with an existing product, much of it required redesign: the front section, the new drum, the interface, and even the frame.
The design inherited features it couldn't use, such as the built-in word processor. And the constant-current feature was pointless for the Shuttle and just wasted power.</p>
<p>When I learned that the design had to be completed in just seven months, my opinion of the teleprinter improved. Moreover, the design had many constraints, such as toxicity and
flammability restrictions, that limited the potential approaches.</p>
<p>In the end, the teleprinter was used on over 50 flights, acting as a reliable backup to the somewhat flaky Text and Graphics System (TAGS).<span id="fnref:problems"><a href="#fn:problems">16</a></span>
Despite its name, the Interim Teleprinter turned out to be a long-lasting solution, not interim at all.
So I have to conclude that the teleprinter was a good design, working much better and much longer than intended.<span id="fnref:interim"><a href="#fn:interim">17</a></span></p>
<p>In any case, the Interim Teleprinter is an interesting piece of hardware and I hope you enjoyed this article.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Lurking in Boeing's woeful Q2 financials is an admission that while its Starliner spacecraft might be struggling when it comes to burning fuel, it has no problem whatsoever setting fire to dollar bills.</p>
<p>The Calamity Capsule is currently attached to the International Space Station (ISS) while engineers scrutinize test results and finalize procedures for bringing the Boeing spacecraft – and its two crew members – back to Earth.</p>
<p>The word "calamity" might equally apply to the impact of the project on Boeing's <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/07/31/boeing_q2_2024/">finances</a>. The troubled aerospace titan's <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0000012927/000001292724000055/ba-20240630.htm">filing</a> with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) revealed it would be increasing its "reach-forward loss on the [Starliner] program" by another $125 million.</p>

    

<p>The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/10/27/starliner_losses_closing_in_on/">losses</a> incurred by Boeing thanks to Starliner have comfortably breezed past $1 billion, and will likely surpass $1.6 billion before long. "Risk remains that we may record additional losses in future periods," Boeing observed.</p>

        


        

<p>It is now almost ten years since NASA handed Boeing a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2015/05/29/nasa_hands_boeing_contract_for_first_commercial_crew_mission_to_iss/">contract</a> to develop a vehicle to transport crew to and from the ISS. John Mulholland, then Boeing VP and Program Manager for Commercial Crew and now Boeing's Program Manager for the ISS, said: "We're on track to fly in 2017, and this critical milestone moves us another step closer in fully maturing the CST-100 design."</p>

</ul>
<p>After a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2019/12/20/boeing_starliner_failure/">failed first attempt</a> to reach the ISS, Boeing repeated the non-crewed test flight "<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://boeing.mediaroom.com/2020-04-06-Boeing-Statement-on-Starliners-Next-Flight">at no cost to the taxpayer</a>." Despite that second unmanned try at reaching the ISS being successful, the Calamity Capsule was subject to yet more delays before finally getting off the ground in June with two test pilots onboard for a minimum mission duration of eight days. Destination: The space station, and then home.</p>
<p>Almost two months later, the spacecraft and its human duo remain docked to the ISS. Starliner can't get back to Earth within NASA's safety parameters, due to thruster issues and gas leaks. It is cleared for an emergency return, an option American officials aren't willing to take right now.</p>
<p>NASA and Boeing have yet to set a date for the spacecraft's return. In an update issued on August 1, NASA <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/boeing-crew-flight-test/2024/08/01/nasa-boeing-continue-data-analysis-for-crew-flight-test-evaluation/">noted</a> that the planning for the spacecraft's return was "expected to continue into next week." This includes finalizing undocking procedures and "operational mitigations that could be used in flight, if needed."</p>

        

<p>In its own <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://starlinerupdates.com/starliner-return-to-earth-preps-underway/">update</a>, Boeing reported that return-to-Earth preparations were under way, with teams working through simulations and the ISS crew inspecting the exterior of Starliner using the outpost's Canadarm.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a NASA spokesperson <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/08/yes-nasa-really-could-bring-starliners-astronauts-back-on-crew-dragon/">told Ars</a> the US agency is "evaluating all options." It's thought those possible options include using a SpaceX capsule to do what Starliner right now can't – bring back its pair of pilots.</p>
<p>The next flight of the Starliner is not expected until August 2025, so it seems likely that Boeing's balance sheet will continue to bleed red in the "contracts we wish we'd never signed" column for a while longer. ®</p>

<h2>2024.08.03: Clang vs. Clang: <span>You're making Clang angry. You wouldn't like Clang when it's angry. #compilers #optimization #bugs #timing #security #codescans</span></h2>
<p>This is a blog post about an experiment with Clang.
I need to explain some context first.</p>
<p><strong><a name="optimizations"></a>Compiler "optimizations".</strong>
Try skimming through recent changes to
<a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project">LLVM</a>
and
<a href="https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc">GCC</a>.
You'll find "optimizations",
and tests for "optimizations",
and fixes to tests for "optimizations",
and fixes to bugs in "optimizations".</p>
<p>The bugs <em>admitted</em> in the compiler changelogs
are just the tip of the iceberg.
Whenever possible,
compiler writers refuse to take responsibility for
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/342330/">the</a>
<a href="https://blog.pkh.me/p/37-gcc-undefined-behaviors-are-getting-wild.html">bugs</a>
<a href="https://research.swtch.com/ub">they</a>
<a href="https://gavinhoward.com/2023/08/the-scourge-of-00ub/">introduced</a>,
even though the compiled code worked fine before the "optimizations".
[2024.08.03 edit: Added more links here.]
The excuse for not taking responsibility is that
there are "language standards"
saying that these bugs should be blamed on millions of programmers
writing code that bumps into "undefined behavior",
rather than being blamed on the much smaller group of compiler writers
subsequently changing how this code behaves.
These "language standards" are written by the compiler writers.</p>
<p>Evidently the compiler writers find it more important to continue developing "optimizations"
than to have computer systems functioning as expected.
Developing "optimizations" seems to be
a very large part of what compiler writers are paid to do.</p>
<p>I'm putting "optimizations" in quotes
because compiler "optimizations"
are generally nowhere near the performance
that competent programmers can achieve.
As a cryptographic example,
benchmarks across
<a href="https://bench.cr.yp.to/impl-kem/kyber768.html">many CPUs</a>
show that the <code>avx2</code> implementation of <code>kyber768</code>
is about 4 times faster than portable code compiled with an "optimizing" compiler.
There are
<a href="https://bench.cr.yp.to/">many more examples</a>
like this.</p>
<p>Compiler writers measure an "optimization" as successful
if they can find any example where the "optimization" saves time.
Does this matter for the overall user experience?
The typical debate runs as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000824013718/http://www.research.microsoft.com/~toddpro/papers/law.htm">2000</a>,
  Todd A. Proebsting
  introduced "Proebsting's Law: Compiler Advances Double Computing Power Every 18 <em>Years</em>" (emphasis in original)
  and concluded that "compiler optimization work makes only marginal contributions".
  Proebsting commented
  <a href="https://proebsting.cs.arizona.edu/">later</a> that
  "The law probably would have gone unnoticed had it not been for the protests by those receiving funds to do compiler optimization research."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Arseny Kapoulkine ran various
  <a href="https://zeux.io/2022/01/08/on-proebstings-law/">benchmarks</a>
  in 2022 and concluded that the gains were even smaller:
  "LLVM 11 tends to take 2x longer to compile code with optimizations, and as a
  result produces code that runs 10-20% faster (with occasional outliers in
  either direction), compared to LLVM 2.7 which is more than 10 years old."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compiler writers typically respond with arguments like this:
  "10-20% is gazillions of dollars of computer time saved!
  What a triumph from a decade of work!"</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>But both sides of this debate are founded upon an invalid measurement methodology.
The actual speedup produced by compilers is smaller, and shrinking,
as explained in my talk
<a href="https://cr.yp.to/talks.html#2015.04.16">"The death of optimizing compilers"</a>
in 2015.</p>
<p>If you look at the hot spots in a software system,
the code running often enough for the user to care about performance,
then you find tons of intrinsics and assembly language.
There are 160000 lines of assembly (<code>.asm</code> and <code>.S</code> files) in 
<a href="https://ffmpeg.org/download.html">FFmpeg</a>,
for example.
Faster computers and faster networks are handling more and more data
(e.g., bigger videos for FFmpeg),
putting more and more load on the hot spots.
Benchmarks selected to show the effect of compiler "optimizations"
are not representative of how CPU time is actually being spent.</p>
<p>Meanwhile there are more and more bugs produced by these "optimizations",
and one has to ask how many gazillions of dollars have been lost because of that.
Consider, for example, security.
Deloitte
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240803112553/https://www.deloitte.com/content/dam/assets-shared/docs/services/risk-advisory/2024/cybersecurity-insights-2023-budgets-benchmarks-financial-services-institutions.pdf">reported</a>
that 2023 IT security budgets were half a percent of corporate revenue,
which sounds like hundreds of billions of dollars overall
given that total corporate revenues worldwide were above
<a href="https://www.bu.edu/eci/files/2023/09/Corporate-Power-Module.pdf">$48 trillion</a>
in 2022.
(Some caveats: perhaps Deloitte's half percent was an unweighted average over corporations;
not all corporations respond to surveys.)
It would be interesting to study
what percentage of security failures can be partly or entirely attributed to compiler "optimizations".</p>
<p><strong><a name="timing"></a>Timing leakage.</strong>
The security problems caused by "optimizing" compilers
aren't just traditional bugs,
but also unintentional leakage of secret information into timings,
often allowing those secrets to be reconstructed by
<a href="https://timing.attacks.cr.yp.to/">timing attacks</a>.
To quote a
<a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/Papers/whatyouc.pdf">EuroS&amp;P 2018 paper</a>
by Laurent Simon, David Chisnall, and Ross Anderson:
"A compiler upgrade can suddenly and without warning open a
timing channel in previously secure code.
This arms race is pointless and has to stop."</p>
<p>Is there actually an arms race?
Let's look at the evidence.</p>
<p>The example highlighted in the 2018 paper used a <code>bool</code>
to select between two values.
Obviously <code>bool</code> was triggering the compiler to create conditional jumps.
The paper continued by acknowledging common practice of eliminating <code>bool</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So an extra layer of obfuscation used by cryptographers
is to eradicate <code>bool</code> completely in critical code;
and to have specially-crafted functions to compare integers
in constant time too. OpenSSL currently declares 37
different functions to support this. Unfortunately, compilers
offer no guarantees to such code; the next version of the
same compiler may silently understand it and optimize
the constant-timeness away. Examples of such failures
include the carefully-crafted constant-time implementation of
curve25519 which was broken by Microsoft’s compiler in
2015 [30].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The one example claimed at the end of this quote
is a misunderstanding triggered by the title of the cited 2015 paper, namely
"When constant-time source yields variable-time binary: Exploiting
curve25519-donna built with MSVC 2015".
What was actually happening in the 2015 paper
was that the <code>int64</code> operations in curve25519-donna
were,
<a href="https://research.kudelskisecurity.com/2017/01/16/when-constant-time-source-may-not-save-you/">when compiled for 32-bit x86</a>,
converted into calls to Microsoft's 32-bit <code>int64</code> library,
specifically <code>llmul.asm</code>,
where Microsoft had made the mistake of using data-dependent branches.
Any reasonable concept of source code should include this variable-time library:
that's where the timing leak was created, and it's where the timing leak should be fixed.</p>
<p>Later examples in an
<a href="https://leslyann-daniel.fr/ressources/papers/2020_SP_binsecrel.pdf">S&amp;P 2020 paper</a>
also used <code>bool</code>.
So, hmmm,
could it be that avoiding secret comparisons and secret <code>bool</code> in source code
stops compilers from producing secret conditional branches?
(The reason for listing comparisons separately here
is that, technically, C comparisons produce <code>int</code> rather than <code>bool</code>,
even if the compiler thinks of them as producing <code>bool</code> internally.)</p>
<p>Unfortunately, no, there really is an arms race here.
Never underestimate the ability of "optimizing" compilers to screw things up.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://pqshield.com/pqshield-plugs-timing-leaks-in-kyber-ml-kem-to-improve-pqc-implementation-maturity/">June 2024</a>,
Antoon Purnal reported
a successful timing attack against the Kyber reference code
compiled with some of the "optimization" options
for Clang 15 (released in 2022) or newer.
The reference code had a computation of the form <code>(-((x&gt;&gt;j)&amp;1))&amp;y</code>,
which is <code>y</code> if bit <code>j</code> of <code>x</code> is set, else <code>0</code>.
See the problem?
<span color="0d372c"><strong>CLANG SMASH!</strong></span>
The compiler used a bit-test instruction
to convert bit <code>j</code> of <code>x</code> into a <code>bool</code>,
and then performed a conditional branch based on this <code>bool</code>.</p>
<p>(As a side note,
I would expect this conditional branch to slow down more code than it speeds up.
But remember that compiler writers measure an "optimization" as successful
if they can find <em>any</em> example where the "optimization" saves time.)</p>
<p>Inside LLVM,
this "optimization" is handled by
<code>combineShiftAnd1ToBitTest</code>
in
<code>lib/CodeGen/SelectionDAG/DAGCombiner.cpp</code>.
The function
<code>combineShiftAnd1ToBitTest</code>
was added by Sanjay Patel in
<a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/4e54cf3e0e71b38b2fde1a815e8460b14026762a">September 2019</a>,
and was tweaked by various people later.
I wonder whether anyone has found earlier examples
of compiler "optimizations" crossing the line into introducing <code>bool</code>.</p>
<p>A subsequent compiler patch crossing the same line
was a GCC patch by ARM in
<a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/git/?p=gcc.git;a=commit;f=gcc/match.pd;h=d70720c2382e687e192a9d666e80acb41bfda856">November 2021</a>
to convert <code>(-x)&gt;&gt;31</code> into <code>-(x&gt;0)</code>.
I issued a warning about this in
<a href="https://microblog.cr.yp.to/1713627640/index.html">April 2024</a>.</p>
<p>TIMECOP 2,
which is built into the
<a href="https://bench.cr.yp.to/">SUPERCOP</a>
cryptographic test framework,
automatically scans compiled code for conditional branches derived from secrets,
if the code was declared to be constant-time.
(It also scans code for array indices derived from secrets,
and the
<a href="https://kyberslash.cr.yp.to/papers.html">KyberSlash paper</a>
describes a patch to scan for divisions derived from secrets.)
Checking TIMECOP results is what led to my April 2024 warning.</p>
<p>The original
<a href="https://www.post-apocalyptic-crypto.org/timecop/">TIMECOP 1</a>
from Moritz Neikes
was also a modification to SUPERCOP,
automating an approach taken by Adam Langley's
<a href="https://www.imperialviolet.org/2010/04/01/ctgrind.html">ctgrind</a>.
Some differences between TIMECOP 1 and TIMECOP 2:
TIMECOP 2 automatically marks RNG output as secret;
TIMECOP 2 supports "declassification";
TIMECOP 2 supports designation of "public inputs";
TIMECOP 2 runs on multiple cores.
(This last difference is also a contribution from the KyberSlash paper.)</p>
<p>TIMECOP has limitations:
it supports only instructions supported by Valgrind
(e.g., it gives up on AMD XOP instructions),
and the data flow that it checks
is only the data flow
visible in the test runs that it carries out.
There's continued work on
<a href="https://crocs-muni.github.io/ct-tools/">tools</a>
for checking constant-time behavior.
But I'm happy to report that the equivalent of TIMECOP
is now built into the test suite for
<a href="https://lib.mceliece.org/">libmceliece</a>,
and I hope this spreads to other libraries.</p>
<p>If you've identified a variable-time code snippet,
how do you rewrite it to run in constant time,
while making sure that the rewrite doesn't introduce any bugs?
I gave a talk about this in
<a href="https://cr.yp.to/talks.html#2024.07.22">July 2024</a>.
Part of the talk was explaining some constant-time functions
provided by libmceliece and SUPERCOP;
these functions are provided by files <code>crypto_{int,uint}{8,16,32,64}.h</code>
that you're free to copy into your own projects.
As one example,
the function
<code>crypto_uint32_bitmod_mask(x,j)</code>
has the same effect as <code>-((x&gt;&gt;(j&amp;31))&amp;1)</code>,
but stops the compiler from seeing that there's a 1-bit result.
A fancier example is
<code>crypto_uint32_max(x,y)</code>.</p>
<p>For comparison,
the 2018 paper reported a
<a href="https://github.com/lmrs2/ct_choose">tweak</a>
to Clang/LLVM
to add language support for a constant-time function
<code>__builtin_ct_choose(bool cond, x, y)</code>.
The 2018 paper also incorrectly suggested
that this was the only such function needed.
Maybe this function will get into compilers someday,
but clearly it'll be a long time before you can rely on this function being present for your projects,
and the way it's implemented strikes me as more fragile
than the way <code>crypto_{int,uint}{8,16,32,64}.h</code> are implemented.</p>
<p><strong><a name="proactive"></a>Proactively avoiding problems.</strong>
To the extent that timing leaks introduced by compilers
are detected by pre-deployment test suites for compiled libraries,
we can revert to an older compiler version for deployment
while we're rewriting the code,
so the users stay safe at each moment.
But can we prevent compilers from introducing timing leaks in the first place?</p>
<p>One attractive answer is to distribute the libraries as assembly language.
If your reaction is "Yikes, this makes software correctness hard to audit":
The RWC 2024 talk
<a href="https://iacr.org/submit/files/slides/2024/rwc/rwc2024/38/slides.pdf">"Adoption of high-assurance and highly performant cryptographic algorithms at AWS"</a>
presented fast X25519 software
proven to correctly compute X25519 on all inputs.
The software is written in assembly language
(two versions targeting different 64-bit Intel/AMD CPUs,
and two versions targeting different 64-bit ARM CPUs);
the correctness statement is a theorem about the machine code, the same code that users are running;
the proof is verified by the
<a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jrh13/hol-light/">HOL Light</a> theorem prover.</p>
<p>However,
the argument against assembly is valid
for cryptographic software
that hasn't reached this gold standard yet.
So I've also been looking at ways to rapidly introduce anti-timing-leak vaccinations
into code written in C, C++, etc.</p>
<p>The shared feature of <code>x&amp;1</code> and <code>x&gt;&gt;31</code>
is that there are just two possibilities for the result:
<code>x&amp;1</code> is <code>0</code> or <code>1</code>;
<code>x&gt;&gt;31</code> is <code>0</code> or <code>1</code> if <code>x</code> is <code>uint32</code>;
<code>x&gt;&gt;31</code> is <code>0</code> or <code>-1</code> if <code>x</code> is <code>int32</code>.
(Side note: always compile with <code>-fwrapv</code> so that GCC and Clang assume twos-complement arithmetic.)
In each case,
someone writing a compiler "optimization" can easily say "Hey, I can stick that 1-bit result into a <code>bool</code>".
There are more possibilities to think about
(what about <code>x&amp;2</code>? what about <code>x&lt;&lt;31</code>? what about 2-bit results?),
but let's focus on these examples as case studies.</p>
<p>Simply scanning source code for <code>&amp;1</code>, <code>1&amp;</code>, <code>&gt;&gt;31</code>, and so on finds many examples,
but I've also tried a quick experiment with another type of scanning,
which is what the title of this blog post is referring to.
I'm not sure this second type is better overall,
but it does seem to have some interesting capabilities.</p>
<p>I wrote a simple
<a href="https://blog.cr.yp.to/20240803-patch.txt">patch</a>
for the LLVM "optimizer" (starting from commit 68df06a0b2998765cb0a41353fcf0919bbf57ddb)
to scan for <code>&amp;1</code> and <code>&gt;&gt;31</code>,
and to issue remarks saying
"please take this away before clang does something bad".
Here's an example of compiling a test function with
<code>clang -Rpass-analysis=clang-vs-clang -O -c x.c</code>
after the patch:</p>
<pre><code>    x.c:3:5: remark: clang-vs-clang: clang sees signed&gt;&gt;(bits-1); please take this away before clang does something bad [-Rpass-analysis=clang-vs-clang]
        3 |   x &gt;&gt;= 31;
          |     ^
    x.c:3:5: remark: clang-vs-clang: clang sees signed&gt;&gt;(bits-1); please take this away before clang does something bad [-Rpass-analysis=clang-vs-clang]
</code></pre>
<p>This is the test function:</p>
<pre><code>    int sra31(int x)
    {
      x &gt;&gt;= 31;
      return x;
    }
</code></pre>
<p>Repetitions of the remark are unsurprising:
compilers will keep trying to apply "optimizations"
until they stop making progress.</p>
<p>The <code>clang-vs-clang</code> output distinguishes <code>signed</code> from <code>unsigned</code> for shifts.
This distinction matters for a (manual or automatic) rewrite in terms of <code>crypto_{int,uint}{8,16,32,64}.h</code>.
(One way to automate source transformations is via <code>clang-tidy</code>.)
Of course,
code omitted because of <code>#ifdef</code>,
or otherwise eliminated before this "optimization" step,
won't trigger any remarks from <code>clang-vs-clang</code>.
[2024.08.03 edit: Fixed typo.]</p>
<p>I then ran SUPERCOP 20240716 (<code>./data-do-biglittle</code> on a dual EPYC 7742
<a href="https://blog.cr.yp.to/20230609-turboboost.html">with overclocking disabled</a>),
after adjusting SUPERCOP's compiler list to use <code>clang-vs-clang</code> (adding <code>-Rpass-analysis=clang-vs-clang</code>
to the <code>clang</code> lines in <code>okcompilers/{c,cpp}</code>).</p>
<p>Results were ready three hours later.
There were 675752 lines from Clang,
in total 210786494 bytes,
compressing to 3595199 bytes in
<a href="https://blog.cr.yp.to/20240803-fromclang.txt.gz"><code>20240803-fromclang.txt.gz</code></a>.
There's quite a bit of noise in the output
because various source-code branches on public data
trigger Clang to internally generate <code>&amp;1</code> for the branch conditions.
Skipping past those finds more interesting examples.</p>
<p>Here's an example that had also been found by simpler source-code scans
and that is clearly good to proactively change:</p>
<pre><code>    a0 += (a0&gt;&gt;15)&amp;106;
</code></pre>
<p>Here's an example where a source-code scan would have required some effort at C parsing.
The macro <code>ONE8</code> is defined as <code>((uint8_t)1)</code>:</p>
<pre><code>    *pk2^=(((*pk_cp)&gt;&gt;ir)&amp;ONE8)&lt;&lt;jr;
</code></pre>
<p>Here's another example that's even harder to find by simpler scans:</p>
<pre><code>    mask = signmask_x16(sub_x16(x,const_x16((q+1)/2)));
</code></pre>
<p>The macro <code>signmask_x16(x)</code> is defined as <code>_mm256_srai_epi16((x),15)</code>,
an AVX2 intrinsic to shift each signed 16-bit piece in a 256-bit vector right by 15 bits.</p>
<p>This last one isn't high on my priority list to rewrite.
The easiest way I could imagine the vector operation turning into a conditional branch
is to compile for AVX-512, which has vectorized <code>bool</code>,
and to have the compiler decide for some strange reason to convert those into serial <code>bool</code> for a conditional branch.
For the moment,
given that TIMECOP uses Valgrind and that
<a href="https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=383010">Valgrind doesn't support AVX-512</a>,
I don't recommend compiling for AVX-512 anyway.</p>
<p>The examples I found most interesting were 
64-bit right-shifts of <code>int128</code> triggering the <code>&gt;&gt;</code> warning.
Sure, makes sense that the implementation of <code>int128</code>
is internally using a 63-bit right shift of the top 64-bit word
to figure out the sign;
but what happens if Clang adds GCC-like support
for converting 63-bit right shifts into <code>bool</code> and then into conditional branches?
Suddenly all sorts of <code>int128</code> code will be variable-time,
much like what the 2015 paper was claiming but this time really with no <code>bool</code> in the source.
I think the easiest way to protect against this at the source level
is to avoid the compiler's existing implementation of <code>int128</code>
in favor of some <code>crypto_int128</code> functions.
A side advantage of writing those functions is that <code>crypto_int128</code>,
unlike the <code>int128</code> in GCC and Clang,
will work on small 32-bit platforms.</p>
<p>Beyond these scans,
there are some other ideas I should mention.
Adding support to GCC and Clang for secret data types
<em>sounds</em> great,
but I don't see how to make this robust
given how GCC and Clang are structured.
I have more hope for compilers
that are built for security in the first place.
Security-focused compilers
that require new input languages,
such as
<a href="https://github.com/plsyssec/fact">FaCT</a>
and the actively developed
<a href="https://github.com/jasmin-lang/jasmin">Jasmin</a>,
raise concerns about code-rewriting time,
but, c'mon, is this really so scary?
We have to be taking some sort of action anyway,
given how compilers are handling current code.

<p>We recently reported on <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/08/01/pirate-streaming-app-ios-app-store/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how multiple pirate streaming apps for iOS managed to get approved on the App Store</a> by tricking the review process. Although we briefly mentioned some of the techniques used by these developers, <em>9to5Mac</em> has now taken a deep dive into how these apps are engineered to trick Apple.</p>



<h2 id="h-techniques-used-by-developers-to-bypass-the-app-store-review">Techniques used by developers to bypass the App Store review</h2>



<p>Last month, an app called “Collect Cards” reached the top of the App Store’s ranking of the most downloaded free apps in some countries. <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/07/19/pirate-streaming-ios-app-store-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">After our report</a>, Apple took the app down – but many other versions of the same app were later released on the App Store. But how exactly are developers able to trick the App Store review team?</p>



<p>In our original report, we explained that these apps use geofence to prevent anyone at Apple from seeing what the app is actually capable of. But by analyzing the code of these apps, we now have a better idea of how this happens.</p>



<p>As we guessed, these apps share the same code base – even if they are distributed by different developer accounts. They’re built on React Native, a cross-platform framework based on JavaScript, and use Microsoft’s CodePush SDK which allows developers to update parts of the app without having to send a new build to the App Store.</p>



<p>Building React Native apps and using CodePush is not against App Store rules. In fact, there are many popular apps that do so. However, malicious developers take advantage of these technologies to bypass the App Store review.</p>



<p>One of the apps analyzed by <em>9to5Mac</em> points to a <a href="https://github.com/luminazz/teki" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GitHub repository</a> that seems to provide files for multiple pirate streaming apps. This app also uses <a href="http://ip-api.com/json" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a specific API</a> to check the location of the device based on the IP address. It returns data such as the country, region, city, and even estimated longitude and latitude.</p>



<p>When the app is opened for the first time, it waits a few seconds to call the geolocation API. This way, the App Store’s automated review process doesn’t see anything unusual in the app’s code. We also checked the app’s behavior by running it through a proxy to fake our location to San Jose, California. For this location, the app never reveals its hidden interface.</p>

<p>After Apple approves the app with its basic functionalities, developers use CodePush to update it with anything they want. The app then reveals its true interface in “safe” locations.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-can-apple-do-about-it">What can Apple do about it?</h2>



<p>Of course, Apple is not immune to apps trying to trick its review system. However, the company could improve it by implementing additional tests to check the app’s behavior in other locations. At the same time, Apple should more proactively find and remove scam apps from the App Store.</p>



<p>In 2017,&nbsp;<a href="https://9to5mac.com/2017/04/24/uber-tricked-apple-probably-story/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Uber was accused of working on a “geofence” for Apple’s headquarters in Cupertino</a>. When the app was run inside this geofence, it automatically disabled codes used to fingerprint and track the user across the web. Even so, it seems that Apple hasn’t done much to prevent other situations like this.</p>



<p>In 2021, documents revealed that the&nbsp;<a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/05/07/app-store-review-process-has-over-500-human-experts-less-than-1-of-rejections-are-appealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">App Store Review team has more than 500 human experts to review more than 100,000 apps every week</a>. Even so, the vast majority of apps go through automated review processes to check if they violate the App Store guidelines before undergoing the manual review process.</p>



<p>Following the publication of our articles, an Apple spokesperson told <em>9to5Mac</em> that the apps have been removed from the App Store, but no details have been provided about the company’s measures to prevent other apps like this from getting approved.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>July 31, 2024, 2:58 p.m.</p><p>From loading up the Wayback Machine to meticulous AirTables to 72 hours of scraping, journalists are doing whatever they can to keep their clips when websites go dark.</p><div id="content_div-229467">


<p>When news sites shut down, those sites’ owners often don’t prioritize the preservation of the content.</p>
<p>MTV <a href="https://variety.com/2024/digital/news/mtv-news-website-archives-pulled-offl-1236047163/">pulled down MTV News</a> in June. After Deadspin was sold, many of its archives <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/deadspin-new-owners-reveal-plans-betting-content-no-ai/">temporarily disappeared</a>. This week, Flaming Hydra <a href="https://flaminghydra.com/the-awl-archive-is-gone/">reported</a> that <a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2018/01/hurry-up-before-its-gone-new-york-city-the-awl-and-the-hairpin-are-shutting-down/">The Awl’s archives</a> are gone. And those examples are just from the past couple of months; in 2021, the authors of a Reynolds Journalism Institute report <a href="https://rjionline.org/rji/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/The-State-of-Digital-News-Preservation-2021-04-19.pdf">found</a> that just 7 out of 24 newsrooms they interviewed were fully preserving their news content.</p>
<p>“It’s really kind of a web of responsibility in terms of creating an accurate record,” <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/talya-c-9b6909132/">Talya Cooper</a>, a research curation librarian at NYU and The Intercept’s former archivist, told me. “When you hear about something being shut down, it’s not just ‘Wow, all of this content is being lost.’ It’s also all of the content that is derived from this content —&nbsp;a key bedrock of evidence that could be used to verify a claim, or bolster someone’s career, or any number of things.”</p>
<p>AI further complicates matters — what happens when sites are used to feed ChatGPT, then go offline? “What happens when that information is baked into large language models and the source of that information is not live on the web anymore?” Cooper wondered. “It’s kind of mind-boggling to think about, but it is reality for a lot of websites that have been crawled and had their content put into the blender of large language models. How will it be possible, in the future, to trace back some of the claims that will be made by ChatGPT if the content is no longer alive?”</p>
<p>When news sites’ archives disappear, readers aren’t the only ones who lose out —&nbsp;there are all kinds of personal and professional challenges for journalists, too. They’re left to archive their work on their own, so that they have clips to show the next job. Web pages, photographs, and text stories are easier to save than audio files, interactives, and other types of digital journalism; to preserve those, journalists often have to get creative. Paid personal archiving services are available, but “it’s not necessarily appealing when you’re just trying to look for a way to save something that was previously online for free,” one journalist told me.</p>
<p>I spoke with three journalists about how they’re going beyond the Wayback Machine to preserve their own work.</p>
<h3>“Is there a plan in place to archive work?”</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexandraazzi/">Alex Azzi</a>, a career women’s sports reporter, is a LexisNexis pro and often mines newspaper archives for stories about athletes’ middle and high school sports careers. It can actually be easier to find women’s sports stories from the 1980s and 1990s from newspaper archives, she said, than stories than from the early 2000s — when, as print newspapers declined, bloggers started filling reporting gaps.</p>
<p>Often, those blogs don’t stay online forever. Women’s sports have <a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2021/03/most-tv-completely-ignores-womens-sports-a-30-year-study-finds/">long been undercovered</a> by traditional news organizations; “fans stepped in to fill that void by creating their own work,” Azzi said. “[But] running a website, just maintaining servers, can be really expensive.”</p>
<p>Once, when Azzi was working on a story related to women’s hockey, she needed to find information about a lawsuit. A reporter named <a href="https://x.com/itsmeglinehan?lang=en">Meg Linehan</a> had worked for a women’s sports publication called <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ExcelleSports/">Excelle Sports</a> and was the only person to cover the lawsuit in-depth at the time. But Excelle Sports shut down in 2017 after just two years of publishing and its stories were no longer online.</p>
<p>Azzi got in touch with Linehan. Linehan shared a copy of a draft of the story in Google Docs, but she no longer remembered how close the draft was to the published version.</p>
<p>In the case of women’s hockey, Azzi found that some of the best-kept archives existed on the servers of the University of Toronto. Since the 1990s, former University of Toronto computer science professor and hockey player <a href="https://x.com/andriahunter">Andria Hunter</a> archived Canadian women’s hockey coverage on her university website. Recently, she’s started moving all of that work over to a personal website,<a href="http://www.whockey.com/">The Women’s Hockey Web</a>.</p>
<p>“Thank goodness she did that because [otherwise] we would have no records of the early years of the first Women’s Hockey League in Canada,” Azzi said.</p>
<p>In November 2022, Azzi was laid off from NBC Sports. In June 2023, NBC started redesigning its website, which temporarily took much of Azzi’s work offline while she was applying to other jobs, leaving her without active links for clips. She found links to some of her stories on the Wayback Machine and Wikipedia; luckily, she also had some PDFs saved.</p>
<p>“I constantly have to be editing my resume to make sure that it’s [accurately linking] to my work,” Azzi said. “NBC Sports links ended up changing for a lot of my stories.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Gutted to see that – after a website revamp – every story I wrote for NBC Sports/On Her Turf is no longer online.</p>
<p>Lots of reporting that never appeared anywhere else… I’ll cross my fingers it reappears.</p>
<p>Too much women’s sports history has been lost to shuttered websites. <a href="https://t.co/135etc4atv">pic.twitter.com/135etc4atv</a></p>
<p>— Alex Azzi (@ByAlexAzzi) <a href="https://twitter.com/ByAlexAzzi/status/1674185609554931712?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 28, 2023</a></p></blockquote>

<p>In July 2023, Azzi was hired as senior editor of women’s sports coverage for The Messenger.</p>
<p>“One of the questions I was thinking about when I got offered that job — I don’t think I ultimately asked it because I didn’t want to sound like I was predicting the end too soon — was ‘Is there a plan in place to archive work?’” Azzi told me. The site <a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2024/02/economic-headwinds-no-the-messengers-flop-is-the-result-of-one-mans-blindness-to-his-own-bad-ideas/">shut down</a> in February 2024, after just six months, and everyone’s work “disappeared by 7 p.m. the night the site shut down,” Azzi recalled. She doesn’t necessarily think that asking about archives when she got the job offer would have resulted in a different outcome. “But I do think it’s kind of funny, in retrospect, that that was one of the things that was already on my mind,” she said.</p>
<p>Luckily, Azzi undertook some of her own preservation work in her time at The Messenger. She archived around 30 stories on the Wayback Machine so that her writers would have some record of their work. She also copy and pasted freelancers’ stories into Word documents (a tedious process that required reformatting stories to remove ads, while making sure the documents still had visual indicators to show the stories had indeed been published on a professional news site.)</p>
<p>“I went through and was like, okay, what are the stories that I would be saddest to see [gone] if there was no longer an online record of them? What are the stories that I think are most important to make sure that there’s some record of them going forward?” Azzi recalled. “It wasn’t a complete collection.”</p>
<h3>“Any outlet could close”</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andreagtrrz/">Andrea Gutierrez</a>, a freelance radio reporter based in Los Angeles, is currently updating her archive of her own work. She keeps a detailed AirTable with the air dates of her pieces, the shows or programs they aired on, and Dropbox links to the physical audio files.</p>
<p>The physical audio files are key. When KPCC <a href="https://laist.com/shows/airtalk/kpcc-will-now-be-known-as-laist-89-3-heres-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-rebrand">rebranded</a> and moved all of its contents over to <a href="http://laist.com/">LAist.com</a>, the KPCC links stopped working and she had to find the new URLs. Also, there isn’t always an easy way to download audio files from the site.</p>
<p>Some pieces may stay online, semi-trapped within the platforms they were originally uploaded to. When Gutierrez was working for TED Radio Hour, she produced social videos that combined audio scripts from the show with videos with the hosts. She didn’t save the video files for herself; they’re still on Instagram, but she can’t retrieve them without resorting to “shady sites to download the videos.”</p>
<p>“You have to think about those things,” Gutierrez said. “Is NPR always going to have a downloadable file? It’s easy to download them now. But [will that always be true]?”</p>
<p>Before working in journalism, Gutierrez was a production editor at a university where her main job was to archive students’ theses and dissertations. Later, she worked for a feminist print magazine called<a href="http://www.makeshiftmag.com/"> Make / Shift</a>. When the magazine shut down in 2017, it donated all of its archives to an archive in Los Angeles. Those experiences made her realize that the person ultimately responsible for saving her work is her.</p>
<p>“Any job could end. Any outlet could close,” Gutierrez said. “I knew I had to have my own back.”</p>
<h3>“My wife saved my ass”</h3>
<p>In the months before Vice <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/media/2024/02/22/vice-media-shuts-down-layoffs/">shut down</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-gault-9b286384/">Matthew Gault</a>, then a reporter for Motherboard, and his colleagues generally knew the end was coming, but they weren’t sure exactly when it would be. When they heard rumors that the closure was imminent, in February 2024, they scrambled to save their work. Gault had 10 years worth of clips from Vice, and the idea of right-clicking to “save as PDF” for hundreds of stories was unappealing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">VICE has shut off our ability to download our emails after we received an anonymous tip that they’re going to be deleting our entire website today.</p>
<p>fun times in the media death spiral!!! will update once i know whether or not we’re all fired</p>
<p>— ʝꪖꪀꪊᦓ ᥅ꪮᦓꫀ (@janusrose) <a href="https://twitter.com/janusrose/status/1760683182389956757?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 22, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>“My wife saved my ass,” Gault told me. “She had already built a scraper that would scrape the sites, pull out all the advertisements, and then save it as a readable PDF for every single individual piece.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/karen-gault-a8819822/">Karen Gault</a>, the heroine of this story, is a software engineer for a local power company. To scrape her husband’s byline, she customized a script based on <a href="https://github.com/freedomofpress/gotham-grabber">Gotham Grabber</a>, open-source code on GitHub to scrape stories from Gothamist and DNAinfo. Once she successfully scraped her husband’s byline, they moved to help other writers.</p>

<p>Karen Gault’s computer screen, where she scraped multiple Vice bylines at a time.</p>
</div>
<p>Matthew organized a Signal chat with current and former Vice employees who wanted their work saved, and in one weekend, Karen and their friend Chris scraped more than 60 author tags. In a massive Google Drive folder, they uploaded a zipped file for each journalist with their own Vice archive.</p>
<p>One particular byline took nearly an entire day to scrape, Karen said, because so many of the reporter’s 3,200 stories were filled with images, which take more time to pull out.</p>
<p>Matthew was in charge of making dinner that weekend, and resolved to save his own work in the future. As of today, Vice’s website and content is still online but no one knows when that might change.</p>
<p>“I’m fairly cynical about all this and tend to think that things go away very easily. And given that attitude, I should have known better,” Matthew said. “There’s a lot of stuff that I’m very proud of. In 10 years, to not be able to look at things and have my memory jogged about the experience of writing, or the talks with editors that came to make that piece happen —&nbsp;that would be a big personal loss for me.”</p>

<p>Large legacy news outlets are often better equipped to preserve their archives than smaller digital-only news outlets because they have the resources. But those protocols have to be constantly updated and refined to keep up with changing technology and evolving forms of journalism.</p>
<p>“It’s not just a question of running out of money in the future,” NYU’s Tayla Cooper said. “What if your site gets ransomware? What if the power goes out at your website provider? There are a lot of scenarios in which you might want an archive of the things that you’ve created.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nytryan/">Ryan Murphy</a> has been working in the archives department of The New York Times since 1997, when he started as an intern. Today, he creates merchandise for sale using materials from the archives —&nbsp;calendars, books, and so on. He’s also the customer reprint sales agent, helping anyone who calls looking for a specific issue or story from the Times.</p>
<p>Even at a paper as large as the Times, things can go missing, Murphy said. There are two types of archives: the historical archives, usually in black and white and on microfilm, and the modern archives, in color and high resolution. When Murphy first joined the paper, the modern archives were on CD-ROMs and his job was to manage that collection. Each color issue of The Times was on its own CD.</p>
<p>“Whenever reporters wanted the original color issue, they would check it out like it was a library CD. Sometimes that would not come back,” Murphy said. “One day, I was like, ‘You know what, I’m just going to copy every CD-ROM into my computer.’ Finally, we made a server to hold all these old digital files, but a lot of them went missing. That just goes to show, like, we have access to information from hundreds of years ago, but sometimes we lose things from 2002.”</p>
<p>Good digital preservation is expensive, Cooper said. Less expensive methods are labor-intensive. Because of financial constraints, newsrooms may rely on content management systems as imperfect archive instead of investing in digital asset management systems.</p>
<p>“When I was at The Intercept, we were like, ‘Why would we need an archive when we have everything is in WordPress?’ But if a website is to shut down, where does the WordPress go? Where does the CMS go?” Cooper said. “All journalists have had a story in the CMS that somehow vanished when they refreshed the page. [We need to] think a little bit bigger-picture about the idea of journalism as evidence and an archive, and not just a business of putting things out every day.”</p>
<p>When I asked Cooper what she would do if she were an archivist for a news outlet that was shutting down, she said she would reach out to organizations like <a href="https://wiki.archiveteam.org/">Archive Team</a> or the Library of Congress, and ask them if they could take on the task of archiving the site and sustaining the archives long-term. Similar services exist in academia —&nbsp;<a href="https://clockss.org/">CLOCKSS</a> and <a href="https://www.portico.org/">Portico</a>, for instance, are digital archiving services for scholarly articles and journals.</p>
<p>“It would be more beneficial to everyone involved if it were possible to transfer the server to an institution or allow the institution to access it and scrape it rather than doing a web crawl,” Cooper said. “Transferring over the backends, rather than relying on front-end capture is another way that we can think about digital preservation. I don’t know if I know of an example where that actually has happened. That’s a dream scenario.”</p>

<!-- %h3 About -->
<p>Ich habe selber eine FPGA architektur in 7400 Logik realisiert und erzähle, was denn son ein FPGA überhaupt ist und wie dieser funktioniert</p>

<p>FPGAs sind eine einzigartige Form von high-performance chip für Nichenanwendugen. Nur wenige kennen FPGAs überhaupt und noch weniger wissen, wie deren interne Architektur aussieht.
<br>Inspiriert durch Ben Eaters 8-bit CPU on breadboard habe ich selber einen simplen FPGA in hardware aufgebaut. Anhand dieses Models erzähle ich detailiert und low-level, was ein FPGA ist und wie ich meine Version entwickelt habe.</p>
