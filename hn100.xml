          <p>Note that Keith could have got his answer minutes sooner, and needn't have kept Tim waiting. In fact, Tim could have started thinking about the question right away!</p>
<p>People who do this are generally trying to be polite by not jumping right into the request, like one would in person or on the phone - and that's great! But it's 2022 and chat is neither of those things. For most people, typing is much slower than talking. So despite best intentions, <strong>you're actually just making the other person wait</strong> for you to phrase your question, which is lost productivity (and kinda annoying).</p>
<p>The same goes for:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Hello, are you around?"</li>
<li>"hi sophie - quick question."</li>
<li>"You got a sec?"</li>
<li>"yt?"</li>
<li>"ping"</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Just ask the question!</strong> üò´</p>

          <p>If you feel it's a bit brusque to simply say "Hi" and ask the question, <strong>you can still preface your message with as many pleasantries as you see fit.</strong></p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>"hey man, what's up? also, any idea when that thing's due?"</li>
<li>"Hi there! Hope you're well. I'm after the latest deck, when you get a sec :)"</li>
<li>"hey, if you're not busy, could you update those NFRs?"</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>It may seem trivial, but asking your question before getting that initial salutatory reply also allows for <strong>asynchronous communication</strong>. If the other party is away, and you leave before they come back, they can still answer your question, instead of just staring at a "Hello" and wondering what they missed.</p>
<p>When done right - everyone's happy! üéâ</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><!--[--><!--[--><!----><!----><main>  <img src="https://www.brainonllm.com/brainonllm.png" alt="Your Brain on ChatGPT: Accumulation of Cognitive Debt when Using an AI Assistant for Essay Writing Task"> <div><p>as seen on:</p> <p><img src="https://www.brainonllm.com/media/NewYorkTimes.svg" alt="The New York Times"> <img src="https://www.brainonllm.com/media/salon-logo.svg" alt="Salon"></p></div> <p>With today's wide adoption of LLM products like ChatGPT from OpenAI, humans and businesses
		engage and use LLMs on a daily basis. Like any other tool, it carries its own set of advantages
		and limitations. This study focuses on finding out the cognitive cost of using an LLM in the
		educational context of writing an essay.</p> <p>We assigned participants to three groups: LLM group, Search Engine group, Brain-only group,
		where each participant used a designated tool (or no tool in the latter) to write an essay. We
		conducted 3 sessions with the same group assignment for each participant. In the 4th session we
		asked LLM group participants to use no tools (we refer to them as LLM-to-Brain), and the
		Brain-only group participants were asked to use LLM (Brain-to-LLM). We recruited a total of 54
		participants for Sessions 1, 2, 3, and 18 participants among them completed session 4.</p> <p>We used electroencephalography (EEG) to record participants' brain activity in order to assess
		their cognitive engagement and cognitive load, and to gain a deeper understanding of neural
		activations during the essay writing task. We performed NLP analysis, and we interviewed each
		participant after each session. We performed scoring with the help from the human teachers and
		an AI judge (a specially built AI agent).</p> <p>We discovered a consistent homogeneity across the Named Entities Recognition (NERs), n-grams,
		ontology of topics within each group. EEG analysis presented robust evidence that LLM, Search
		Engine and Brain-only groups had significantly different neural connectivity patterns,
		reflecting divergent cognitive strategies. Brain connectivity systematically scaled down with
		the amount of external support: the Brain‚Äëonly group exhibited the strongest, widest‚Äëranging
		networks, Search Engine group showed intermediate engagement, and LLM assistance elicited the
		weakest overall coupling. In session 4, LLM-to-Brain participants showed weaker neural
		connectivity and under-engagement of alpha and beta networks; and the Brain-to-LLM participants
		demonstrated higher memory recall, and re‚Äëengagement of widespread occipito-parietal and
		prefrontal nodes, likely supporting the visual processing, similar to the one frequently
		perceived in the Search Engine group. The reported ownership of LLM group's essays in the
		interviews was low. The Search Engine group had strong ownership, but lesser than the Brain-only
		group. The LLM group also fell behind in their ability to quote from the essays they wrote just
		minutes prior.</p> <p>As the educational impact of LLM use only begins to settle with the general population, in this
		study we demonstrate the pressing matter of a likely decrease in learning skills based on the
		results of our study. The use of LLM had a measurable impact on participants, and while the
		benefits were initially apparent, as we demonstrated over the course of 4 months, the LLM
		group's participants performed worse than their counterparts in the Brain-only group at all
		levels: neural, linguistic, scoring.</p> <p>We hope this study serves as a preliminary guide to understanding the cognitive and practical
		impacts of AI on learning environments.</p> <p>Distributed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/" target="_blank">CC BY-NC-SA 4.0</a></p> <p>¬© Copyright 2025: <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/people/nkosmyna/overview/" target="_blank">Nataliya Kosmyna</a>, Eugene Hauptmann</p></main><!----><!----><!----><!--]--> <!--[!--><!--]--><!--]-->

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://nolanlawson.com/2025/06/16/selfish-reasons-for-building-accessible-uis/">https://nolanlawson.com/2025/06/16/selfish-reasons-for-building-accessible-uis/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44294853">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p>All web developers know, at some level, that accessibility is important. But when push comes to shove, it can be hard to prioritize it above a bazillion other concerns when you‚Äôre trying to center a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> and you‚Äôre on a tight deadline.</p>
<p>A lot of accessibility advocates lead with the moral argument: for example, that disabled people should have just as much access to the internet as any other person, and that it‚Äôs a blight on our whole industry that we continually fail to make it happen.</p>
<p>I personally find these arguments persuasive. But experience has also taught me that ‚Äúeat your vegetables‚Äù is one of the least effective arguments in the world. Scolding people might get them to agree with you in public, or even in principle, but it‚Äôs unlikely to change their behavior once no one‚Äôs watching.</p>
<p>So in this post, I would like to list some of my personal, completely selfish reasons for building accessible UIs. No finger-wagging here: just good old hardheaded self-interest!</p>
<h2>Debuggability</h2>
<p>When I‚Äôm trying to debug a web app, it‚Äôs hard to orient myself in the DevTools if the entire UI is ‚Äúdiv soup‚Äù:</p>
<pre title="">&lt;div class="css-1x2y3z4"&gt;
  &lt;div class="css-c6d7e8f"&gt;
    &lt;div class="css-a5b6c7d"&gt;
      &lt;div class="css-e8f9g0h"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="css-i1j2k3l"&gt;Library&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="css-i1j2k3l"&gt;Version&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="css-i1j2k3l"&gt;Size&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="css-c6d7e8f"&gt;
    &lt;div class="css-m4n5o6p"&gt;
      &lt;div class="css-q7r8s9t"&gt;UI&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="css-u0v1w2x"&gt;React&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="css-u0v1w2x"&gt;19.1.0&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="css-u0v1w2x"&gt;167kB&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="css-m4n5o6p"&gt;
      &lt;div class="css-q7r8s9t"&gt;Style&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="css-u0v1w2x"&gt;Tailwind&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="css-u0v1w2x"&gt;4.0.0&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="css-u0v1w2x"&gt;358kB&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="css-m4n5o6p"&gt;
      &lt;div class="css-q7r8s9t"&gt;Build&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="css-u0v1w2x"&gt;Vite&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="css-u0v1w2x"&gt;6.3.5&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="css-u0v1w2x"&gt;2.65MB&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>
<p>This is actually a table, but you wouldn‚Äôt know it from looking at the HTML:</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="14927" data-permalink="https://nolanlawson.com/2025/06/16/selfish-reasons-for-building-accessible-uis/screenshot-from-2025-06-15-10-50-44/" data-orig-file="https://nolanlawson.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/screenshot-from-2025-06-15-10-50-44.png" data-orig-size="585,275" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Screenshot from 2025-06-15 10-50-44" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://nolanlawson.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/screenshot-from-2025-06-15-10-50-44.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://nolanlawson.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/screenshot-from-2025-06-15-10-50-44.png?w=570" src="https://nolanlawson.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/screenshot-from-2025-06-15-10-50-44.png?w=570" alt="Screenshot of an HTML table with column headers library, version, and size, row headers UI, style, and build, and values React/Tailwind/Vite with their version numbers and build size in the cells." width="570" height="268"></p>
<p>If I‚Äôm trying to debug this in the DevTools, I‚Äôm completely lost. Where are the rows? Where are the columns?</p>
<pre title="">&lt;table class="css-1x2y3z4"&gt;
  &lt;thead class="css-a5b6c7d"&gt;
    &lt;tr class="css-y3z4a5b"&gt;
      &lt;th scope="col" class="css-e8f9g0h"&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th scope="col" class="css-i1j2k3l"&gt;Library&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th scope="col" class="css-i1j2k3l"&gt;Version&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th scope="col" class="css-i1j2k3l"&gt;Size&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody class="css-a5b6c7d"&gt;
    &lt;tr class="css-y3z4a5b"&gt;
      &lt;th scope="row" class="css-q7r8s9t"&gt;UI&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;td class="css-u0v1w2x"&gt;React&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td class="css-u0v1w2x"&gt;19.1.0&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td class="css-u0v1w2x"&gt;167kB&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr class="css-y3z4a5b"&gt;
      &lt;th scope="row" class="css-q7r8s9t"&gt;Style&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;td class="css-u0v1w2x"&gt;Tailwind&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td class="css-u0v1w2x"&gt;4.0.0&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td class="css-u0v1w2x"&gt;358kB&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr class="css-y3z4a5b"&gt;
      &lt;th scope="row" class="css-q7r8s9t"&gt;Build&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;td class="css-u0v1w2x"&gt;Vite&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td class="css-u0v1w2x"&gt;6.3.5&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td class="css-u0v1w2x"&gt;2.65MB&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
</pre>
<p>Ah, that‚Äôs much better! Now I can easily zero in on a table cell, or a column header, because they‚Äôre all <em>named</em>. I‚Äôm not wading through a sea of <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s anymore.</p>
<p>Even just adding ARIA <code>role</code>s to the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s would be an improvement here:</p>
<pre title="">&lt;div class="css-1x2y3z4" role="table"&gt;
  &lt;div class="css-a5b6c7d" role="rowgroup"&gt;
    &lt;div class="css-m4n5o6p" role="row"&gt;
      &lt;div class="css-e8f9g0h" role="columnheader"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="css-i1j2k3l" role="columnheader"&gt;Library&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="css-i1j2k3l" role="columnheader"&gt;Version&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="css-i1j2k3l" role="columnheader"&gt;Size&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="css-c6d7e8f" role="rowgroup"&gt;
    &lt;div class="css-m4n5o6p" role="row"&gt;
      &lt;div class="css-q7r8s9t" role="rowheader"&gt;UI&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="css-u0v1w2x" role="cell"&gt;React&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="css-u0v1w2x" role="cell"&gt;19.1.0&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="css-u0v1w2x" role="cell"&gt;167kB&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="css-m4n5o6p" role="row"&gt;
      &lt;div class="css-q7r8s9t" role="rowheader"&gt;Style&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="css-u0v1w2x" role="cell"&gt;Tailwind&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="css-u0v1w2x" role="cell"&gt;4.0.0&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="css-u0v1w2x" role="cell"&gt;358kB&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="css-m4n5o6p" role="row"&gt;
      &lt;div class="css-q7r8s9t" role="rowheader"&gt;Build&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="css-u0v1w2x" role="cell"&gt;Vite&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="css-u0v1w2x" role="cell"&gt;6.3.5&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="css-u0v1w2x" role="cell"&gt;2.65MB&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>
<p>Especially if you‚Äôre using a CSS-in-JS framework (which I‚Äôve simulated with <a href="https://daverupert.com/2021/08/css-modules-in-css-modules/#:~:text=Can%20CSS%20Modules%20be%20more%20like%20CSS%20Modules%3F">robo-classes</a> above), the HTML can get quite messy. Building accessibly makes it a lot easier to understand at a distance what each element is supposed to do.</p>
<h2>Naming things</h2>
<p>As all programmers know, naming things is hard. UIs are no exception: is this an ‚Äúautocomplete‚Äù? Or a ‚Äúdropdown‚Äù? Or a ‚Äúpicker‚Äù?</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="14944" data-permalink="https://nolanlawson.com/2025/06/16/selfish-reasons-for-building-accessible-uis/screenshot-from-2025-06-15-11-10-20/" data-orig-file="https://nolanlawson.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/screenshot-from-2025-06-15-11-10-20.png" data-orig-size="273,315" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Screenshot from 2025-06-15 11-10-20" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://nolanlawson.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/screenshot-from-2025-06-15-11-10-20.png?w=260" data-large-file="https://nolanlawson.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/screenshot-from-2025-06-15-11-10-20.png?w=273" src="https://nolanlawson.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/screenshot-from-2025-06-15-11-10-20.png" alt="Screenshot of a combobox with &quot;Ne&quot; typed into it and states below in a list like Nebraska, Nevada, and New Hampshire." width="273" height="315"></p>
<p>If you read the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/combobox/examples/combobox-autocomplete-both/">WAI ARIA guidelines</a>, though, then it‚Äôs clear what it is: a ‚Äúcombobox‚Äù!</p>
<p>No need to grope for the right name: if you add the proper <code>role</code>s, then everything is already named for you:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>combobox</code></li>
<li><code>listbox</code></li>
<li><code>option</code>s</li>
</ul>
<p>As a bonus, you can use <code>aria-*</code> attributes or <code>role</code>s as a CSS selector. I often see awkward code like this:</p>
<pre title="">&lt;div
  className={isActive ? 'active' : ''}
  aria-selected={isActive}
  role='option'
&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>
<p>The <code>active</code> class is clearly redundant here. If you want to style based on the <code>.active</code> selector, you could just as easily style with <code>[aria-selected="true"]</code> instead.</p>
<p>Also, why call it <code>isActive</code> when the ARIA attribute is <code>aria-selected</code>? Just call it ‚Äúselected‚Äù everywhere:</p>
<pre title="">&lt;div
  aria-selected={isSelected}
  role='option'
&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>
<p>Much cleaner!</p>
<p>I also find that thinking in terms of roles and ARIA attributes sharpens my thinking, and gives structure to the interface I‚Äôm trying to create. Suddenly, I have a <em>language</em> for what I‚Äôm building, which can lead to more ‚Äúobvious‚Äù variable names, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_cascading_variables/Using_CSS_custom_properties">CSS custom properties</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-area">grid area names</a>, etc.</p>
<h2>Testability</h2>
<p><a href="https://nolanlawson.com/2019/11/05/what-ive-learned-about-accessibility-in-spas/#:~:text=Easier%20integration%20testing">I‚Äôve written about this before</a>, but building accessibly also helps with writing tests. Rather than trying to select an element based on arbitrary classes or attributes, you can write more elegant code like this (e.g. with Playwright):</p>
<pre title="">await page.getByLabel('Name').fill('Nolan')

await page.getByRole('button', { name: 'OK' }).click()
</pre>
<p>Imagine, though, if your entire UI is full of <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s and robo-classes. How would you find the right inputs and buttons? You could select based on the robo-classes, or by searching for text inside or nearby the elements, but this makes your tests brittle.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://kentcdodds.com/blog/making-your-ui-tests-resilient-to-change">Kent C. Dodds has argued</a>, writing UI tests based on <em>semantics</em> makes your tests more resilient to change. That‚Äôs because a UI‚Äôs semantic structure (i.e. the accessibility tree) tends to change less frequently than its classes, attributes, or even the composition of its HTML elements. (How many times have you added a wrapper <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> only to break your UI tests?)</p>
<h2>Power users</h2>
<p>When I‚Äôm on a desktop, I tend to be a keyboard power user. I like pressing <kbd>Esc</kbd> to close dialogs, <kbd>Enter</kbd> to submit a form, or even <kbd>/</kbd> in Firefox to quickly jump to links on the page. I do use a mouse, but I just prefer the keyboard since it‚Äôs faster.</p>
<p>So I find it jarring when a website breaks keyboard accessibility ‚Äì <kbd>Esc</kbd> doesn‚Äôt dismiss a dialog, <kbd>Enter</kbd> doesn‚Äôt submit a form, <kbd>‚Üë</kbd>/<kbd>‚Üì</kbd> don‚Äôt change radio buttons. It disrupts my flow when I unexpectedly have to reach for my mouse. (Plus it‚Äôs a <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/brown-out/">Van Halen brown M&amp;M</a> that signals to me that the website probably messed something else up, too!)</p>
<p>If you‚Äôre building a productivity tool with its own set of keyboard shortcuts (think Slack or GMail), then it‚Äôs even more important to get this right. You can‚Äôt add a lot of sophisticated keyboard controls if the basic <kbd>Tab</kbd> and focus logic doesn‚Äôt work correctly.</p>
<p>A lot of programmers are themselves power users, so I find this argument pretty persuasive. Build a UI that you yourself would like to use!</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The reason that I, personally, care about accessibility is probably different from most people‚Äôs. I have a family member who is blind, and I‚Äôve known many blind or low-vision people in my career. I‚Äôve heard firsthand how frustrating it can be to use interfaces that aren‚Äôt built accessibly.</p>
<p>Honestly, if I were disabled, I would probably think to myself, ‚Äúcomputer programmers must not care about me.‚Äù And judging from the <a href="https://webaim.org/projects/million/">miserable WebAIM results</a>, I‚Äôd clearly be right:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Across the one million home pages, 50,960,288 distinct accessibility errors were detected‚Äîan average of 51 errors per page.
</p></blockquote>
<p>As a web developer who has dabbled in accessibility, though, I find this situation tragic. It‚Äôs not <em>really</em> that hard to build accessible interfaces. And I‚Äôm not talking about ‚Äúideal‚Äù or ‚Äúoptimized‚Äù ‚Äì the bar is pretty low, so I‚Äôm just talking about something that <em>works at all</em> for people with a disability.</p>
<p>Maybe in the future, accessible interfaces won‚Äôt require so much manual intervention from developers. Maybe AI tooling (on either the production or consumption side) will make UIs that are usable out-of-the-box for people with disabilities. I‚Äôm actually sympathetic to the Jakob Nielsen argument that <a href="https://jakobnielsenphd.substack.com/p/accessibility-generative-ui">‚Äúaccessibility has failed‚Äù</a> ‚Äì it‚Äôs hard to look at the WebAIM results and come to any other conclusion. Maybe the ‚Äúeat your vegetables‚Äù era of accessibility has failed, and it‚Äôs time to try new tactics.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs why I wrote this post, though. You can build accessibly without having a bleeding heart. And for the time being, unless generative AI swoops in like a <em>deus ex machina</em> to save us, it‚Äôs our responsibility as interface designers to do so.</p>
<p>At the same time we‚Äôre helping others, though, we can also help ourselves. Like a good hot sauce on your Brussels sprouts, eating your vegetables doesn‚Äôt always have to be a chore.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/why-generative-ai-coding-tools-and-agents-do-not-work-for-me">https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/why-generative-ai-coding-tools-and-agents-do-not-work-for-me</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44294633">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>People keep asking me If I use Generative AI tools for coding and what I think of them, so this is my effort to put my thoughts in writing, so that I can send people here instead of having to repeat myself every time I get the question.</p>
<p>From the title you already know that this isn't a pro-AI blog post. But it isn't an anti-AI post either, at least I don't think it is. There are already plenty of articles by AI promoters and AI critics, so I don't feel there is a need for me to write one more of those. While I'm definitely not neutral on the subject, in this article I'm just going to share my personal experience with these tools, from a strictly technical point of view.</p>
<h2>AI is not faster</h2>
<p>Really the main and most important reason why GenAI tools do not work for me is that <strong>they do not make me any faster</strong>. It's really that simple.</p>
<p>It would be easy to use GenAI coding tools to have code written for me. A coding agent would be the most convenient, as it would edit my files while I do something else. This all sounds great, in principle.</p>
<p>The problem is that I'm going to be responsible for that code, so I cannot blindly add it to my project and hope for the best. I could only incorporate AI generated code into a project of mine after I thoroughly review it and make sure I understand it well. I have to feel confident that I can modify or extend this piece of code in the future, or else I cannot use it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately reviewing code is actually harder than most people think. It takes me at least the same amount of time to review code not written by me than it would take me to write the code myself, if not more. There is actually a well known saying in our industry that goes something like "it‚Äôs harder to read code than to write it." I believe it was Joel Spolsky (creator of Stack Overflow and Trello) who formalized it first in his <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/04/06/things-you-should-never-do-part-i/">Things You Should Never Do, Part I</a> article.</p>
<p>You could argue that code that was written by AI can be considered a black box. I guess you can convince yourself that as long as the code works as intended it is safe to use without the need to review it, which would translate into some productivity increase. I think this is highly irresponsible, because the AI is not going to assume any liability if this code ever malfunctions. I'm always the responsible party for the code I produce, with or without AI. Taking on such a large risk is nuts, in my opinion.</p>
<p>This is even more important for some of the work that I do where there are contracts signed, with associated legal obligations and money payments. If I'm hired as a professional, I really have no other choice than to be one. AI tools cannot help me make more money or do my work in less time. The only way I could achieve those things is by degrading the quality of the work and introducing risk, and I'm not willing to do that.</p>
<h2>AI is not a multiplier</h2>
<p>I've heard people say that GenAI coding tools are a multiplier or enabler for them. Basically those who make this claim say that they are able to work faster and tackle more difficult problems when using GenAI. Unfortunately these claims are just based on the perception of the subjects themselves, so there is no hard data to back them up. I guess it is possible that some people can be more efficient reviewing code than I am, but I honestly doubt it. What I think happens is that these people save time because they only spot review the AI generated code, or skip the review phase altogether, which as I said above would be a deal breaker for me.</p>
<p>Another common argument I've heard is that Generative AI is helpful when you need to write code in a language or technology you are not familiar with. To me this also makes little sense. The part that I enjoy the most about working as a software engineer is learning new things, so not knowing something has never been a barrier for me. The more you practice learning the easier and faster it gets! In recent times I had to learn Rust, Go, TypeScript, WASM, Java and C# for various projects, and I wouldn't delegate this learning effort to an AI, even if it saved me time. Which it wouldn't, because of all the reasons above about being responsible for the code that I produce. Sorry if I'm a bit repetitive on this.</p>
<h2>AI code is different than human code</h2>
<p>I made all these points to a friend the other day and he asked me why then I gladly accept open source contributions to my projects when they are made by people. Aren't those also code that is not written by myself? Why are those okay but AI generated code is not?</p>
<p>The truth that may be shocking to some is that open source contributions submitted by users do not really save me time either, because I also feel I have to do a rigorous review of them. But I enjoy working with users who have an interest in my projects and take time to report bugs, request new features or submit code changes. These interactions are a source of new ideas more than anything, so they directly help me do better work. This is what I love the most of working in open source!</p>
<p>My friend, who is still unconvinced, suggests I could launch a bunch of AI agents in parallel to create PRs for all my open bugs. It's a game changer, he says. Unfortunately that would cost me money and likely make me slower, for the reasons explained above. Even if we assume that AI coding tools are sophisticated enough (they are not) to fix issues in my projects with little or no supervision, I'm still the bottleneck because all that code has to be reviewed before it can be merged.</p>
<p>The unfortunate side of AI coding tools being widely available is that some users now also generate low effort pull requests with them. I have received some of these, and it's interesting that there is a sort of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley">uncanny valley</a> effect that triggers in me when I start reading AI generated code that hasn't been edited and refined by a real person. When I come across pull requests of this type I start asking questions to the submitters about the weird parts of their submissions, because I consider them responsible for the code they want me to merge. They rarely respond.</p>
<h2>AI is not the same as an intern</h2>
<p>Many AI advocates say that you should treat your AI coding tool as an intern that is eager to please. I think the people who say this never worked with interns!</p>
<p>In the beginning, delegating work to an intern causes a productivity decrease for you, for the same reasons I enumerated above. Interns need a lot of hand-holding, and all the code they produce needs to be carefully reviewed before it is accepted.</p>
<p>But interns <em>learn</em> and get better over time. The time that you spend reviewing code or providing feedback to an intern is not wasted, it is an investment in the future. The intern absorbs the knowledge you share and uses it for new tasks you assign to them later on. The need for close supervision goes down throughout the duration of the internship. In the end, interns are often hired by their companies as full time employees because they become successful independent contributors.</p>
<p>An AI tool can only resemble an intern with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterograde_amnesia">anterograde amnesia</a>, which would be a bad kind of intern to have. For every new task this "AI intern" resets back to square one without having learned a thing!</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I hope with this article I've made the technical issues I have with applying GenAI coding tools to my work clear.</p>
<p>In my experience, there is no such thing as a free lunch with AI coding. I believe people who claim that it makes them faster or more productive are making a conscious decision to relax their quality standards to achieve those gains. Either that or they just say this because they personally benefit from selling AI to you.</p></div><p>Thank you for visiting my blog!

            <p><span>A</span>lmost a decade ago, a Baptist Biblical scholar, a Catholic priest, several rabbis, an Islamic leader, a Zen Buddhist roshi, and more than a dozen other religious leaders walked into a lab‚Äîand took high doses of magic mushrooms.</p>
      
    <p>All of them said it was their first time taking the drug. The <a href="https://nautil.us/what-hallucinogens-will-make-you-see-308247/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mind-altering details</a> of these guided trips were recorded at the time and over the following 16 months, but it wasn‚Äôt until recently that the results of the controversial experiment came to light.</p><p>One might wonder how a single psilocybin trip could compare to the catalog of rich transcendent experiences that might accumulate over a lifetime of religious devotion. But according to the <a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/psymed.2023.0044" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">findings</a>, which were published in the peer-reviewed journal <em>Psychedelic Medicine</em>, the vast majority of the 33 clergy who participated in the study‚Äîmore than 90 percent‚Äîsaid taking psilocybin was one of the most spiritually meaningful and deeply sacred experiences of their lives. Almost half said it was the most profound thing they had ever experienced, period. Many of them also said it made them better religious leaders.&nbsp;</p><div><p>Now, years later, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/05/26/this-is-your-priest-on-drugs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">some of these clergy</a> have become evangelists for psychedelics, incorporating them into their own religious teachings. For some of them, the experience led to a release from attachment to dogmas and greater openness to other forms of religious experience. For at least one participant, it was a dark, empty, terrifying trip. Still, none of them ruled out using psilocybin again in the future.</p><p>Publication of the study took so long in part due to charges of ethical lapses, including potential conflicts of interest related to funding sources, as well as the direct involvement of a funder in the research itself. But these conflicts were eventually resolved through disclosure, which the authors say they always intended. Questions also swirled around certain flaws in the study‚Äôs execution, which even the authors, scientists at Johns Hopkins University and New York University, admit. </p><p>One issue was bias: Participants may have been primed to see their experiences as sacred by language used in recruitment ads and by the expectations of those running the experiment. (Many of those who chose to participate were also considering leaving the profession at the outset and so could have been seeking a way to reconnect with the divine.) The sample was also small, heavily white, male, and Christian; and representation of a number of major world religions, including Indigenous religious traditions, Hinduism, Taoism, and Confucianism, was absent.</p></div>

          </div><p>Still the results raise questions about the relationship between hallucinogens and religious experience. Most of the major world religions today (Hinduism, Judaism, Buddhism, Christianity, Islam) do not advocate the use of mind-altering substances.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>
Version 0.2.0 of the Chawan TUI browser has been released.
</p><p>
A tarball of the source tree is available
<a href="https://chawan.net/dl/chawan-0-2-0-src.tar.xz">here</a>.  Please refer to the README
file for compilation instructions.
</p><p>
A static binary distribution for
<a href="https://chawan.net/dl/chawan-0-2-0-linux-amd64.tar.xz">amd64 Linux</a> also exists.
To install it, extract the archive somewhere and run <code>make install</code>
as root.  (To uninstall, run <code>make uninstall</code>.)
</p><p>
The same distribution is also available as a <a href="https://chawan.net/dl/chawan-0-2-0-amd64.deb">.deb
package</a>.
</p><h2 id="information-for-package-maintainers"><a href="#information-for-package-maintainers">##</a> Information for package maintainers</h2>
<p>
The current list of mandatory runtime dependencies is:
</p><ul>
<li>libssh2.
</li><li>libbrotli (more precisely, libbrotlicommon and libbrotlidec).
</li><li>OpenSSL or LibreSSL.  For OpenSSL, you will want 3.0 or later.
For LibreSSL, the version in OpenBSD 7.7 has been tested.
</li></ul>
<p>
Previous development versions had other dependencies which no
longer apply, and can be dropped.  In particular, zlib, libseccomp,
termcap/ncurses and libcurl are no longer used.
</p><p>
If you run into an issue while packaging Chawan, please contact me
before trying to patch over it.  Chances are we can solve it upstream.
</p><h2 id="whats-next"><a href="#whats-next">##</a> What's next</h2>
<p>
It took a bit longer than expected, but I finally feel OK putting a
version on this.  It has all features I wanted from an MVP, and no known
fatal bugs.
</p><p>
The v0.2 branch in git will only receive bugfixes.  Further work on new
features will continue on the master branch.
</p><p>
For the next release, I hope to improve upon the layout module's
performance &amp; correctness, and to make the UI somewhat more user
friendly.  Stay tuned :)

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Elsewhere I've been asked about the task of replaying the bootstrap process for rust. I figured it would be fairly straightforward, if slow. But as we got into it, there were <em>just</em> enough tricky / non-obvious bits in the process that it's worth making some notes here for posterity.</p><p>UPDATE: someone has <a href="https://github.com/LegionMammal978/rust-from-ocaml">also scripted many of the subsequent snapshot builds</a> covering many years of rust's post-bootstrap development. Consider the rest of this post just a verbose primer for interpreting their work.</p><h3>context</h3><p>Rust started its life as a compiler written in ocaml, called <b>rustboot</b>. This compiler did <em>not</em> use LLVM, it just emitted 32-bit i386 machine code in 3 object file formats (Linux PE, macOS Mach-O, and Windows PE).</p><p>We then wrote a <em>second</em> compiler <em>in Rust</em> called <b>rustc</b> that <em>did</em> use LLVM as its backend (and which, yes, is the genesis of today's rustc) and ran rustboot on rustc to produce a so-called "stage0 rustc". Then stage0 rustc was fed the sources of rustc again, producing a stage1 rustc. Successfully executing this stage0 -&gt; stage1 step (rather than just crashing mid-compilation) is what we're going to call "bootstrapping". There's also a third step: running stage1 rustc on rustc's sources again to get a stage2 rustc and checking that it is bit-identical to the stage1 rustc. Successfully doing <em>that</em> we're going to call "fixpoint".</p><p>Shortly after we reached the fixpoint we <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/6997adf76342b7a6fe03c4bc370ce5fc5082a869">discarded rustboot</a>. We stored stage1 rustc binaries as snapshots on a shared download server and all subsequent rust builds were based on downloading and running that. Any time there was an incompatible language change made, we'd add support and re-snapshot the resulting stage1, gradually growing a long list of snapshots marking the progress of rust over time.</p><h3>time travel and bit rot</h3><p>Each snapshot can typically only compile rust code in the rust repository written between its birth and the next snapshot. This makes replaying the entire history awkward (<a href="https://github.com/LegionMammal978/rust-from-ocaml">see above</a>). We're not going to do that here. This post is just about replaying the initial bootstrap and fixpoint, which happened back in April 2011, 14 years ago.</p><p>Unfortunately all the tools involved -- from the host OS and system libraries involved to compilers and compiler-components -- were and are moving targets. Everything bitrots. Some examples discovered along the way:</p><ul><br><li>Modern clang and gcc won't compile the LLVM used back then (C++ has changed too much -- and I tried several CXXFLAGS=-std=c++NN variants!)<br></li><li>Modern gcc won't even compile the gcc used back then (apparently C as well!)<br></li><li>Modern ocaml won't compile rustboot (ditto)<br></li><li>14-year-old git won't even connect to modern github (ssh and ssl have changed too much)<br></li></ul><h3>debian</h3><p>We're in a certain amount of luck though:</p><ul><br><li>Debian has maintained both EOL'ed docker images and still-functioning fetchable package archives at the same URLs as 14 years ago. So we can time-travel using that. A VM image would also do, and if you have old install media you could presumably build one up again if you are patient.<br></li><li>It is easier to use i386 since that's all rustboot emitted. There's some indication in the Makefile of support for multilib-based builds from x86-64 (I honestly don't remember if my desktop was 64 bit at the time) but 32bit is much more straightforward.<br></li><li>So: <tt>docker pull --platform linux/386 debian/eol:squeeze</tt> gets you an environment that works.<br></li><li>You'll need to install rust's prerequisites also: g++, make, ocaml, ocaml-native-compilers, python.<br></li></ul><h3>rust</h3><p>The next problem is figuring out the code to build. Not totally trivial but not <em>too</em> hard. The best resource for tracking this period of time in rust's history is actually the rust-dev mailing list archive. There's <a href="https://www.mail-archive.com/rust-dev@mozilla.org/info.html">a copy online at mail-archive.com</a> (and Brian keeps <a href="https://github.com/brson/rust-dev-archives">a public backup of the mbox file</a> in case that goes away). Here's <a href="https://www.mail-archive.com/rust-dev@mozilla.org/msg00329.html">the announcement that we hit a fixpoint</a> in April 2011. You kinda have to just know that's what to look for. So that's the rust commit to use: 6daf440037cb10baab332fde2b471712a3a42c76. This commit still exists in the rust-lang/rust repo, no problem getting it (besides having to copy it into the container since the container can't contact github, haha).</p><h3>LLVM</h3><p>Unfortunately we only started pinning LLVM to specific versions, using submodules, <em>after</em> bootstrap, closer to the initial "0.1 release". So we have to guess at the LLVM version to use. To add some difficulty: LLVM at the time was developed on subversion, and we were developing rust against <a href="https://github.com/brson/llvm">a fork of a git mirror of their SVN</a>. Fishing around in that repo at least finds a version that builds -- <a href="https://github.com/brson/llvm/commit/45e1a53efd40a594fa8bb59aee75bb0984770d29">45e1a53efd40a594fa8bb59aee75bb0984770d29</a>, which is "the commit that exposed </p><tt>LLVMAddEarlyCSEPass</tt><p>", a symbol used in the rustc LLVM interface. I bootstrapped with that (brson/llvm) commit but subversion also numbers all commits, and they were preserved in the conversion to the modern LLVM repo, so you can see the same svn id 129087 as <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/e4e4e3758097d7967fa6edf4ff878ba430f84f6e">e4e4e3758097d7967fa6edf4ff878ba430f84f6e</a> over in the official LLVM git repo, in case brson/llvm goes away in the future.</p><p>Configuring LLVM for this build is also a little bit subtle. The best bet is to actually read the rust 0.1 configure script -- when it was managing the LLVM build itself -- and work out what it would have done. But I have done that and can now save you the effort: </p><tt>./configure --enable-targets=x86 --build=i686-unknown-linux-gnu --host=i686-unknown-linux-gnu --target=i686-unknown-linux-gnu --disable-docs --disable-jit --enable-bindings=none --disable-threads --disable-pthreads --enable-optimized</tt><p>So: configure and build that, stick the resulting bin dir in your path, and configure and make rust, and you're good to go!</p><pre>root@65b73ba6edcc:/src/rust# sha1sum stage*/rustc
639f3ab8351d839ede644b090dae90ec2245dfff  stage0/rustc
81e8f14fcf155e1946f4b7bf88cefc20dba32bb9  stage1/rustc
81e8f14fcf155e1946f4b7bf88cefc20dba32bb9  stage2/rustc
</pre><h3>Observations</h3><p>On my machine I get: 1m50s to build stage0, 3m40s to build stage1, 2m2s to build stage2. Also stage0/rustc is a 4.4mb binary whereas stage1/rustc and stage2/rustc are (identical) 13mb binaries.</p><p>While this is somewhat congruent with my recollections -- rustboot produced code faster, but its code ran slower -- the effect size is actually much less than I remember. I'd convinced myself retroactively that rustboot was produced <em>abysmally</em> worse code than rustc-with-LLVM. But out-of-the-gate LLVM only boosted performance by 2x (and cost of 3x the code size)! Of course I also have a faster machine now. At the time bootstrap cycles took about a half hour each (<a href="https://www.mail-archive.com/rust-dev@mozilla.org/msg00331.html">according to this: 15 minutes for the 2nd stage</a>).</p><p>Of course you can still see this as a condemnation of the entire "super slow dynamic polymorphism" model of rust-at-the-time, either way. It may seem funny that this version of rustc bootstraps faster than today's rustc, but this "can barely bootstrap" version was a mere 25kloc. Today's rustc is 600kloc. It's really comparing apples to oranges.</p></div></div>]]></description>

The identity of the reviewers will remain anonymous, unless they choose otherwise ‚Äî as happens now. But the exchanges between the referees and the authors will be accessible to all. Our aim in doing so is to open up what many see as the ‚Äòblack box‚Äô of science, shedding light on how a research paper is made.

These discussions, which can last for months, aim to improve a study‚Äôs clarity and the robustness of its conclusions. It is a hugely important process that should receive increased recognition, including acknowledgement of the reviewers involved, if they choose to be named. For early-career researchers, there is great value in seeing inside a process that is key to their career development. Making peer-reviewer reports public also enriches science communication: it‚Äôs a chance to add to the ‚Äòstory‚Äô of how a result is arrived at, or a conclusion supported, even if it includes only the perspectives of authors and reviewers. The full story of a paper is, of course, more complex, involving many other contributors.</p><p>Many people think of science as something fixed and unchanging. But scientific knowledge evolves as new or more-nuanced evidence comes to light. Scientists constantly discuss their results, yet these debates are not contained in research papers and often remain unreported in wider science-communication efforts.</p><article data-label="Related"><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-01162-1" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"><img alt="" src="https://media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-01880-9/d41586-025-01880-9_17620936.jpg"><p>Three-year trial shows support for recognizing peer reviewers</p></a></article><p>The COVID-19 pandemic provided a brief interlude during which much of the world got to see how research works, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01444-z" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01444-z" data-track-category="body text link">almost in real time</a>. It‚Äôs easy to forget that, right from the start, we were continuously learning something new about the nature and behaviour of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. On television screens, in newspapers and on social media worldwide, scientists were discussing among themselves and with public audiences the nature of the virus, how it infects people and how it spreads. They were debating treatments and prevention methods, constantly adjusting everyone‚Äôs knowledge <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01173-7" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01173-7" data-track-category="body text link">as fresh evidence came to light</a>. And then, it went mostly back to business as usual.</p><p>We hope that publishing the peer-reviewer reports of all newly submitted <i>Nature</i> papers shows, in a small way, that this doesn‚Äôt need to remain the case. <i>Nature</i> started mandating peer review for all published research articles only in 1973 (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1098/rsnr.2015.0029" data-track="click" data-label="https://doi.org/10.1098/rsnr.2015.0029" data-track-category="body text link">M. Baldwin <i>Notes Rec.</i> <b>69</b>, 337‚Äì352; 2015</a>). But the convention in most fields is still to keep the content of these peer-review exchanges confidential. That has meant that the wider research community, and the world, has had few opportunities to learn what is discussed.</p><p>Peer review improves papers. The exchanges between authors and referees should be seen as a crucial part of the scientific record, just as they are a key part of doing and disseminating research.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<article>
   

  <div><p>Picture this, you‚Äôre a teenager in the middle of the ocean on a cruise ship. All is good, except you‚Äôre lacking your lifeblood: internet. You could pay $170 for seven days of throttled internet on a <em>single</em> device, and perhaps split it via a travel router or hotspot, but that still seems less than ideal.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve been travelling Europe with family and am currently on REDACTEDCRUISELINE Cruises‚Äô REDACTEDCRUISELINE cruise ship. For the past two days, the ship has mostly been in port, so I was able to use a cellular connection. This quickly became not feasible as we got further from land, where there was no coverage. At around the same time, I wanted to download the REDACTEDCRUISELINE Cruises app on my phone, and realized that it would give me a <em>one-time 15-minute</em> internet connection. I activated it, and quickly realized that it didn‚Äôt limit you to just the Play Store or App Store: all websites could be accessed. I soon realized that this ‚Äúone-time‚Äù download was MAC-address dependent and thus, could be bypassed by switching MAC addresses. However, doing so logs you out of the REDACTEDSERVICE portal, which is required to get the 15-minutes of free internet.</p>
<p>This means that in order to get just 15 minutes of internet, the following is required:</p>
<ol>
<li>Change MAC address</li>
<li>Login to REDACTEDSERVICE with date-of-birth and room number, binding the MAC address to your identity</li>
<li>Send a request with your booking ID activating 15 minutes of free internet, intended to be used for downloading the REDACTEDCRUISELINE app
<ul>
<li>Not completely sure, but it did initially seem that to activate unrestricted access to the internet, you would need to send a simple HTTP to play.google.com, although I don‚Äôt think this is needed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This process, on the surface, seems extremely arduous. But if this could be automated, it would suddenly become a much more viable proposition. After looking at the fetch requests the REDACTEDSERVICE portal was sending to log in and activate the free sessions, I realized that it shouldn‚Äôt be <em>too</em> hard to automate.</p>
<p>Conveniently, my family also brought a travel router running OpenWRT as we were planning on purchasing the throttled single-device plan (which is ~$170 for the entire cruise) and using the router as a hotspot so we could connect multiple devices to the internet. This router (a GL.iNet) allows you to change the MAC address via the admin portal, needing only a single POST request. This meant that if I could string together the API requests to change the MAC address (after getting a token from the router login endpoint), login to REDACTEDSERVICE, and request the free internet session, I would have free internet.</p>
<p>I first tried copying the requests as cURL commands via DevTools into Notepad and using a local LLM to vibe-code a simple bash file. Realizing this wasn‚Äôt going to work, I began work on a Python script instead. I converted the cURL commands to <code>requests</code> via Copilot (yes, I used LLMs to an extent when building this) and started chaining together the requests.</p>
<p>The only issues I faced that took some time to overcome were figuring out how to repeat the requests when needed and being resistant to unexpected HTTP errors. For the former, I initially tried repeating it on an interval (first through a <code>while True</code> loop and later via shell scripting in the container) but later realized it was much easier by checking if internet access expired by sending a request to example.com and checking if it fails. For the latter, I used <code>while True</code> loops to allow the requests to be retried and executed <code>break</code> when the requests succeeded. The only other issue, that still exists, is that occasionally, the connection will drop out while the session is refreshed, although this seems to happen less than every 15 minutes and only lasts for a minute or two.</p>
<p>After comparing speeds with another guy I met on the cruise (who also happens to be a high-school programmer), who had the highest-level REDACTEDSERVICE plan, there seems to be no additional throttling (7+ Mbps). Even better, after connecting my power bank‚Äôs integrated USB-C cable to the router, I‚Äôm able to move around the ship for hours. So far, I‚Äôve been using the router for nearly ~7 hours and my 10,000 mAh power bank is still at 42% battery. In fact, I‚Äôm writing this very post while connected to the router.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://blog.darklang.com/darklang-goes-open-source/">https://blog.darklang.com/darklang-goes-open-source/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44290653">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
        <p>As part of <a href="https://blog.darklang.com/goodbye-dark-inc-welcome-darklang-inc/" rel="noreferrer"><u>shutting down Dark Inc.</u></a> and <a href="https://blog.darklang.com/first-steps-of-darklang-inc/" rel="noreferrer"><u>forming Darklang Inc.</u>,</a> we've finally open-sourced all of our repositories. <a href="https://github.com/darklang?ref=blog.darklang.com"><u>Our source code</u></a> is now under the Apache License 2.0.</p><p>For years, we wrestled with questions of sustainability and how to build something that truly empowers developers. We've long believed in open source philosophically, but felt that Darklang's unique architecture and business model required a different approach.</p><h2 id="why-we-initially-chose-source-available"><strong>Why We Initially Chose Source-Available</strong></h2><p>We originally designed Darklang as a hosted-only platform where you'd code at darklang.com and programs would instantly be live in production. We believed this centralized approach was necessary for features like safe code migration and unified deployment, and that offering self-hosting would undermine our sustainability model.</p><p>The core challenge was building something valuable while ensuring we could continue working on it long-term. Traditional open source funding models all had limitations, so Darklang was designed as "a language with a business model" - users with serious workloads would fund ecosystem development through our hosting platform.</p><h2 id="what-changed-our-thinking"><strong>What Changed Our Thinking</strong></h2><p>Three key shifts changed our perspective:</p><p><strong>Product maturity and user feedback</strong>: The real barrier to Darklang's adoption was never licensing - it was product maturity. As we've gotten closer to building something people love, staying source-available started feeling like an unnecessary risk. We consistently heard that people wanted us to be more open.</p><p><strong>Building for local-first development</strong>: Our technical direction evolved significantly. We're now building Darklang to run locally as a CLI, with the ability to deploy to our cloud or elsewhere. Nobody wants to run a proprietary language binary on their own machine.</p><p><strong>New business opportunities</strong>: The developer tools market has matured since 2017. We now see successful companies charging for team collaboration features and AI-powered tools while keeping the core platform accessible. These create value that teams are willing to pay for, while always having the option to self-host.</p><h2 id="why-open-source"><strong>Why Open Source</strong></h2><p>Open source enables Darklang to be accessible, inspectable, and community-owned. It aligns with our philosophy of democratizing programming and ensures the platform can persist and evolve regardless of any single company's fate.</p><p>We've learned how to deliver Darklang's key benefits - invisible infrastructure, deployless deployment, trace-driven development - without requiring our specific editor or hosting environment. This makes open source viable while preserving what makes Darklang special.</p><h2 id="open-questions"><strong>Open Questions</strong></h2><p>We're still exploring some interesting technical challenges around licensing in the Darklang ecosystem. GitHub handles this by attaching LICENSE.md files, but in a world where a package manager syncs types and functions directly, there are some neat challenges to think through. The core platform being open source gives us a solid foundation to build on.</p><hr><p>Comment on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44290653&amp;ref=blog.darklang.com" rel="noreferrer">Hacker News</a>, <a href="https://x.com/darklang/status/1934633874610643126?ref=blog.darklang.com" rel="noreferrer">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://mas.to/@darklang/114693755778778354?ref=blog.darklang.com" rel="noreferrer">Mastodon</a>, <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/q0zon6/goodbye_dark_inc_hello_darklang_inc?ref=blog.darklang.com" rel="noreferrer">Lobste.rs</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7340415295649423360/?ref=blog.darklang.com" rel="noreferrer">LinkedIn</a></p>

            <p>
      
      Object personification is the attribution of human characteristics to non-human agents. In online forums, autistic individuals commonly report experiencing this phenomenon. Given that approximately half of all autistic individuals experience difficulties identifying their own emotions, the suggestion that object personification may be a feature of autism seems almost paradoxical. Why would a person experience sympathy for objects, when they struggle to understand and verbalise the emotions of other people as well as their own? An online survey was used to assess tendency for personification in 87 autistic and 263 non-autistic adults. Together, our results indicate that object personification occurs commonly among autistic individuals, and perhaps more often (and later in life) than in the general population. Given that in many cases, autistic people report their personification experiences as distressing, it is important to consider the reasons for the increased personification and identify structures for support.

</div>
<p>In 1825, Michael Faraday discovered one of the most fascinating compounds in chemistry: <a title="Benzene" href="https://www.chemistryworld.com/3005709.article">benzene</a>.&nbsp;While isolating the components of oily residues of illuminating gas, Faraday identified a mysterious liquid, with a peculiar aromatic smell, which would go on to transform the landscape of chemistry.</p>
<p>Within the pages of the <em>Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London</em>, Faraday <a title="On new compounds of carbon and hydrogen, and on certain other products obtained during the decomposition of oil by heat" href="https://doi.org/10.1098/rstl.1825.0022">described</a> this seemingly simple yet profoundly unique molecule. What set benzene apart, even in its earliest discovery, was its resistance to easy chemical classification. Its peculiar behaviour, such as its surprising stability despite being highly unsaturated, hinted at a deeper mystery that would not be fully resolved until the mid-19th century with the proposal of its cyclic structure.</p>
<p>Benzene‚Äôs physical properties only added to its mystique. This colourless liquid emitted a faintly sweet, intoxicating aroma ‚Äì a hallmark of aromatic compounds. With a boiling point of 80.1¬∞C, it was volatile and highly flammable, making it both a chemical curiosity and a potential industrial tool. Early chemists were captivated by its ability to dissolve fats, oils and other nonpolar substances, which made it a valuable solvent for experimentation and industrial processes. Yet, it was benzene‚Äôs chemical properties ‚Äì its reactivity and stability ‚Äì that would become the cornerstone of an entire branch of organic chemistry: aromatic compounds.</p>
<p>Today, benzene is everywhere, interwoven into the structures of more complex molecules that enhance our daily lives in fields as diverse as health, energy, advanced materials, electronics, food, dyes and biotechnology. This humble molecule opened the doors to a vast universe of aromatic compounds and an endless array of applications that have redefined our world.</p>
<h3 id="Stability_and_tunability">Stability and tunability</h3>
<p>Following benzene‚Äôs legacy came polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), a fascinating class of organic molecules composed of fused benzene rings. These structures not only preserve benzene‚Äôs aromatic stability, thanks to their electron delocalisation, but also exhibit unique electronic and optical properties determined by their size and arrangement. While smaller PAHs, like <a title="Naphthalene" href="https://www.chemistryworld.com/7362.article">naphthalene</a> and anthracene, had been characterised in the 19th century, the discovery of larger, more complex systems unveiled entirely new and surprising properties ‚Äì from discrete energy levels in simpler molecules to semiconducting behaviours in larger systems like pentacene.</p>
<p>The synthesis and study of these compounds paved the way for nanographenes, opening new dimensions in chemistry and materials science. Through meticulous control over their molecular structures, researchers have learned to design advanced materials with tunable properties, such as electron conductivity, fluorescence, chirality and chemical reactivity. This painstaking precision highlights the intrinsic beauty of chemistry at its most fundamental level, an art of exactitude that continues to push the boundaries of possibility.</p>
<p>A landmark achievement in this journey was the discovery of hexabenzocoronene (HBC), in 1958. This molecule, composed of 42 carbon atoms forming 13 hexagonal rings in a perfectly flat structure, remained the largest fully characterised polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon for decades. Yet the creativity of organic chemistry knows no bounds. Klaus M√ºllen, a pioneer in the exploration of nanographenes, succeeded in 2002 in synthesising a remarkable structure formed by 222 carbon atoms with a diameter of 3nm, demonstrating the immense potential of organic synthesis to construct tailor-made graphene molecules.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Graphene stands out as the ultimate expression of benzene‚Äôs versatility</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The fusion of benzene rings has given rise to some of the most remarkable materials in modern science, including fullerenes and carbon nanotubes. Fullerenes, often referred to as <a title="Buckminsterfullerene" href="https://www.chemistryworld.com/3005718.article">buckyballs</a>, are spherical molecules composed entirely of carbon atoms arranged in a pattern of hexagons and pentagons, resembling a molecular soccer ball. These structures, discovered in 1985, owe their stability and symmetry to the aromaticity derived from benzene-like rings. Similarly, carbon nanotubes ‚Äì long, cylindrical structures composed of fused aromatic rings ‚Äì have captivated scientists with their extraordinary strength, flexibility and electrical conductivity. Both fullerenes and nanotubes exemplify the limitless potential of carbon chemistry, with benzene as the foundational building block.</p>
<p>Among these innovations, graphene stands out as the ultimate expression of benzene‚Äôs versatility. This two-dimensional material, consisting of a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a honeycomb lattice, is essentially a sheet of fused benzene rings. Graphene‚Äôs remarkable properties ‚Äì its transparency, strength, flexibility and electrical conductivity ‚Äì have earned it the title of a ‚Äògift of gods‚Äô. Graphene, like benzene before it, has the power to revolutionise multiple fields, from electronics and energy storage to medicine and materials science.</p>
<p>Beyond its scientific impact, benzene holds a special place in education. Generations of high school and university students have been introduced to the elegance of its structure and the profound mystery surrounding its stability. The study of benzene serves as an accessible entry point for understanding broader concepts like aromaticity, resonance and molecular orbitals. By celebrating the bicentennial of its discovery, we honour not only the legacy of Faraday but also the enduring role of benzene in inspiring curiosity, innovation and the next generation of chemists.</p>
<div>
<p>To celebrate the 200th anniversary of benzene‚Äôs discovery and its extraordinary legacy, the Royal Society of Chemistry will release a thematic special issue, uniting several RSC journals in a collaborative tribute to benzene‚Äôs unparalleled influence.</p>
<p>This special issue, edited by Ben Feringa and Nazario Mart√≠n, will illuminate the enduring relevance of benzene by exploring its far-reaching legacy in carbon-based systems, from the fundamental concepts of aromaticity and antiaromaticity to groundbreaking research on polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), molecular nanographenes (via both top-down and bottom-up approaches), graphene and its derivatives, carbon nanotubes and fullerenes. It will also delve into cutting-edge developments from (anti)aromatic compounds synthesised through on-surface methodologies to benzene-based molecular machines.</p>

            <guid>44290331</guid>
            <pubDate>Mon, 16 Jun 2025 15:09:17 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://coroot.com/blog/opentelemetry-for-go-measuring-the-overhead/">https://coroot.com/blog/opentelemetry-for-go-measuring-the-overhead/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44290331">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>Everything comes at a cost ‚Äî and observability is no exception. When we add metrics, logging, or distributed tracing to our applications, it helps us understand what‚Äôs going on with performance and key UX metrics like success rate and latency. But what‚Äôs the cost?</p>
<p>I‚Äôm not talking about the price of observability tools here, I mean the instrumentation overhead. If an application logs or traces everything it does, that‚Äôs bound to slow it down or at least increase resource consumption. Of course, that doesn‚Äôt mean we should give up on observability. But it does mean we should measure the overhead so we can make informed tradeoffs.</p>
<p>These days, when people talk about instrumenting applications, in 99% of cases they mean OpenTelemetry. OpenTelemetry is a vendor-neutral open source framework for collecting telemetry data from your app such as metrics, logs, and traces. It‚Äôs quickly become the industry standard.</p>
<p>In this post, I want to measure the overhead of using OpenTelemetry in a Go application. To do that, I‚Äôll use a super simple Go HTTP server that increments a counter in an in-memory database <a href="https://valkey.io/">Valkey</a> (a Redis fork) on every request. The idea behind the benchmark is straightforward:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, we‚Äôll run the app under load without any instrumentation and measure its performance and resource usage.</li>
<li>Then, using the exact same workload, we‚Äôll repeat the test with OpenTelemetry SDK for Go enabled and compare the results.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Test setup</h2>
<p>For this benchmark, I‚Äôll use four Linux nodes, each with 4 vCPUs and 8GB of RAM. One will run the application, another will host Valkey, a third will be used for the load generator, and the fourth for observability (using Coroot Community Edition).</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://coroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screenshot-2025-06-12-at-18.20.16.png" alt="" width="3164" height="220" srcset="https://coroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screenshot-2025-06-12-at-18.20.16.png 3164w, https://coroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screenshot-2025-06-12-at-18.20.16-300x21.png 300w, https://coroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screenshot-2025-06-12-at-18.20.16-1024x71.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 3164px) 100vw, 3164px"></p>
<p>I want to make sure the components involved in the test don‚Äôt interfere with each other, so I‚Äôm running them on separate nodes. This time, I‚Äôm not using Kubernetes, instead, I‚Äôll run everything in plain Docker containers. I‚Äôm also using the host network mode for all containers, to avoid <em>docker-proxy</em> introducing any additional latency into the network path.</p>
<p>Now, let‚Äôs take a look at the application code:</p>
<pre><code>package main

import (
	"context"
	"log"
	"net/http"
	"os"
	"strconv"

	"github.com/go-redis/redis/extra/redisotel"
	"github.com/go-redis/redis/v8"

	"go.opentelemetry.io/contrib/instrumentation/net/http/otelhttp"
	"go.opentelemetry.io/otel"
	"go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/otlp/otlptrace"
	"go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/otlp/otlptrace/otlptracehttp"
	"go.opentelemetry.io/otel/propagation"
	"go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/trace"
)

var (
	rdb *redis.Client
)

func initTracing() {
	rdb.AddHook(redisotel.TracingHook{})
	client := otlptracehttp.NewClient()
	exporter, err := otlptrace.New(context.Background(), client)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	tracerProvider := trace.NewTracerProvider(trace.WithBatcher(exporter))
	otel.SetTracerProvider(tracerProvider)
	otel.SetTextMapPropagator(propagation.NewCompositeTextMapPropagator(
		propagation.TraceContext{},
		propagation.Baggage{},
	))
}

func handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	cmd := rdb.Incr(r.Context(), "counter")
	if err := cmd.Err(); err != nil {
		http.Error(w, err.Error(), http.StatusInternalServerError)
		return
	}
	_, _ = w.Write([]byte(strconv.FormatInt(cmd.Val(), 10)))
}

func main() {
	rdb = redis.NewClient(&amp;redis.Options{Addr: os.Getenv("REDIS_SERVER")})
	h := http.Handler(http.HandlerFunc(handler))
	if os.Getenv("ENABLE_OTEL") != "" {
		log.Println("enabling opentelemetry")
		initTracing()
		h = otelhttp.NewHandler(http.HandlerFunc(handler), "GET /")
	}
	log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":8080", h))
}
</code></pre>
<p>By default, the application runs without instrumentation. Only if the environment variable ENABLE_OTEL is set, the OpenTelemetry SDK will be initialized. So runs without this variable will serve as the baseline for comparison.</p>
<h2>Running the Benchmark</h2>
<p>Now let‚Äôs start all the components and begin testing.</p>
<p>First, we launch Valkey using the following command:</p>
<pre><code>docker run --name valkey -d --net=host valkey/valkey</code></pre>
<p>Next, we start the Go app and point it to the Valkey instance by IP:</p>
<pre><code>docker run -d --name app -e REDIS_SERVER="192.168.1.2:6379" --net=host failurepedia/redis-app:0.5</code></pre>
<p>To generate load, I‚Äôll use <a href="https://github.com/giltene/wrk2">wrk2</a>, which allows precise control over request rate. In this test, I‚Äôm setting it to 10,000 requests per second using 100 connections and 8 threads. Each run will last 20 minutes:</p>
<pre><code>docker run --rm --name load-generator -ti cylab/wrk2 \
   -t8 -c100 -d1200s -R10000 --u_latency http://192.168.1.3:8080/
</code></pre>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Let‚Äôs take a look at the results.</p>
<p>We started by running the app without any instrumentation. This serves as our baseline for performance and resource usage. Based on metrics gathered by Coroot using eBPF, the app successfully handled 10,000 requests per second. The majority of requests were served in under 5 milliseconds. The 95th percentile (p95) latency was around 5ms, the 99th percentile (p99) was about 10ms, with occasional spikes reaching up to 20ms.</p>

<p>CPU usage was steady at around 2 CPU cores (or 2 CPU seconds per second), and memory consumption stayed low at roughly 10 MB.</p>

<p>So that‚Äôs our baseline. Now, let‚Äôs restart the app container with the OpenTelemetry SDK enabled and see how things change:</p>
<pre><code>docker run -d --name app \
  -e REDIS_SERVER="192.168.1.2:6379" \
  -e ENABLE_OTEL=1 \
  -e OTEL_SERVICE_NAME="app" \
  -e OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT="http://192.168.1.4:8080/v1/traces" \
  --net=host failurepedia/redis-app:0.5</code></pre>
<p data-start="1069" data-end="1166">Everything else stayed the same ‚Äì the infrastructure, the workload, and the duration of the test.</p>
<p data-start="1168" data-end="1202">Now let‚Äôs break down what changed.</p>
<p data-start="1168" data-end="1202"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://coroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screenshot-2025-06-13-at-14.29.16.png" alt="" width="1584" height="428" srcset="https://coroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screenshot-2025-06-13-at-14.29.16.png 1584w, https://coroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screenshot-2025-06-13-at-14.29.16-300x81.png 300w, https://coroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screenshot-2025-06-13-at-14.29.16-1024x277.png 1024w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1584px) 100vw, 1584px"></p>
<p>Memory usage increased from around 10 megabytes to somewhere between 15 and 18 megabytes. This additional overhead comes from the SDK and its background processes for handling telemetry data. While there is a clear difference, it doesn‚Äôt look like a significant increase in absolute terms, especially for modern applications where memory budgets are typically much larger.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://coroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screenshot-2025-06-13-at-14.28.59.png" alt="" width="1560" height="438" srcset="https://coroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screenshot-2025-06-13-at-14.28.59.png 1560w, https://coroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screenshot-2025-06-13-at-14.28.59-300x84.png 300w, https://coroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screenshot-2025-06-13-at-14.28.59-1024x288.png 1024w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1560px) 100vw, 1560px"></p>
<p>CPU usage jumped from 2 cores to roughly 2.7 cores. That‚Äôs about a 35 percent increase. This is expected since the app is now tracing every request, preparing and exporting spans, and doing more work in the background.</p>
<p>To understand exactly where this additional CPU usage was coming from, I used Coroot‚Äôs built-in eBPF-based CPU profiler to capture and compare profiles before and after enabling OpenTelemetry.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://coroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screenshot-2025-06-13-at-14.53.14.png" alt="" width="3156" height="1680" srcset="https://coroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screenshot-2025-06-13-at-14.53.14.png 3156w, https://coroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screenshot-2025-06-13-at-14.53.14-300x160.png 300w, https://coroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screenshot-2025-06-13-at-14.53.14-1024x545.png 1024w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 3156px) 100vw, 3156px"></p>
<p>The profiler showed that about 10 percent of total CPU time was spent in <em>go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/trace.NewBatchSpanProcessor</em>, which handles span batching and export. Redis calls also got slightly more expensive ‚Äî tracing added around 7 percent CPU overhead to go-redis operations. The rest of the increase came from instrumented HTTP handlers and middleware.</p>
<p>In short, the overhead comes from OpenTelemetry‚Äôs span processing pipeline, not from the app‚Äôs core logic.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://coroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screenshot-2025-06-13-at-12.41.57.png" alt="" width="1552" height="914" srcset="https://coroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screenshot-2025-06-13-at-12.41.57.png 1552w, https://coroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screenshot-2025-06-13-at-12.41.57-300x177.png 300w, https://coroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screenshot-2025-06-13-at-12.41.57-1024x603.png 1024w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1552px) 100vw, 1552px"></p>
<p data-start="1376" data-end="1510">Latency also changed, though not dramatically. With OpenTelemetry enabled, more requests fell into the 5 to 10 millisecond range. The 99th percentile latency went from 10 to about 15 milliseconds. Throughput remained stable at around 10,000 requests per second. We didn‚Äôt see any errors or timeouts.</p>
<p data-start="1376" data-end="1510"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://coroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screenshot-2025-06-13-at-14.45.49.png" alt="" width="1546" height="410" srcset="https://coroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screenshot-2025-06-13-at-14.45.49.png 1546w, https://coroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screenshot-2025-06-13-at-14.45.49-300x80.png 300w, https://coroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screenshot-2025-06-13-at-14.45.49-1024x272.png 1024w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1546px) 100vw, 1546px"></p>
<p data-start="1376" data-end="1510">Network traffic also increased. With tracing enabled, the app started exporting telemetry data to Coroot, which resulted in an outbound traffic volume of about 4 megabytes per second, or roughly 32 megabits per second. For high-throughput services or environments with strict network constraints, this is something to keep in mind when enabling full request-level tracing.</p>
<p>Overall, enabling OpenTelemetry introduced a noticeable but controlled overhead.&nbsp;These numbers aren‚Äôt negligible, especially at scale ‚Äî but they‚Äôre also not a dealbreaker. For most teams, the visibility gained through distributed tracing and the ability to troubleshoot issues faster will justify the tradeoff.</p>
<h2>eBPF-based instrumentation</h2>
<p>I often hear from engineers, especially in ad tech and other high-throughput environments, that they simply can‚Äôt afford the overhead of distributed tracing. At the same time, observability is absolutely critical for them. This is exactly the kind of scenario where eBPF-based instrumentation fits well.</p>
<p>Instead of modifying application code or adding SDKs, an agent can observe application behavior at the kernel level using eBPF. Coroot‚Äôs agent supports this approach and is capable of collecting both metrics and traces using eBPF, without requiring any changes to the application itself.</p>
<p>However, in high-load environments like the one used in this benchmark, we generally recommend disabling eBPF-based tracing and working with metrics only. Metrics still allow us to clearly see how services interact with each other, without storing data about every single request. They‚Äôre also much more efficient in terms of storage and runtime overhead.</p>
<p>Throughout both runs of our test, Coroot‚Äôs agent was running on each node. Here‚Äôs what its CPU usage looked like:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://coroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screenshot-2025-06-13-at-15.12.03.png" alt="" width="1562" height="448" srcset="https://coroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screenshot-2025-06-13-at-15.12.03.png 1562w, https://coroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screenshot-2025-06-13-at-15.12.03-300x86.png 300w, https://coroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screenshot-2025-06-13-at-15.12.03-1024x294.png 1024w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1562px) 100vw, 1562px"></p>
<p data-start="1287" data-end="1572"><em>Node201</em> was running Valkey, <em>node203</em> was running the app, and <em>node204</em> was the load generator. As the chart shows, even under consistent load, the agent‚Äôs CPU usage stayed under 0.3 cores. That makes it lightweight enough for production use, especially when working in metrics-only mode.</p>
<p data-start="1574" data-end="1650">This approach offers a practical balance: good visibility with minimal cost.</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Observability comes at a cost, but as this experiment shows, that cost depends heavily on how you choose to implement it.</p>
<p>OpenTelemetry SDKs provide detailed traces and deep visibility, but they also introduce measurable overhead in terms of CPU, memory, and network traffic. For many teams, especially when fast incident resolution is a priority, that tradeoff is entirely justified.</p>
<p>At the same time, eBPF-based instrumentation offers a more lightweight option. It allows you to collect meaningful metrics without modifying application code and keeps resource usage minimal, especially when tracing is disabled and only metrics are collected.</p>
<p>The right choice depends on your goals. If you need full traceability and detailed diagnostics, SDK-based tracing is a strong option. If your priority is low overhead and broad system visibility, eBPF-based metrics might be the better fit.</p>
<p>Observability isn‚Äôt free, but with the right approach, it can be both effective and efficient.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>A new benchmark developed by academics shows that LLM-based AI agents perform below par on standard CRM tests and fail to understand the need for customer confidentiality.</p>
<p>A team led by Kung-Hsiang Huang, a Salesforce AI researcher, showed that using a new benchmark relying on synthetic data, LLM agents achieve around a 58 percent success rate on tasks that can be completed in a single step without needing follow-up actions or more information.</p>
<p>Using the benchmark tool CRMArena-Pro, the team also showed performance of LLM agents drops to 35 percent when a task requires multiple steps.</p>

    

<p>Another cause for concern is highlighted in the LLM agents' handling of confidential information. "Agents demonstrate low confidentiality awareness, which, while improvable through targeted prompting, often negatively impacts task performance," a <a target="_blank" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.18878">paper published at the end of last month said</a>.</p>

        


        

<p>The Salesforce AI Research team argued that existing benchmarks failed to rigorously measure the capabilities or limitations of AI agents, and largely ignored an assessment of their ability to recognize sensitive information and adhere to appropriate data handling protocols.</p>

</ul>
<p>The research unit's CRMArena-Pro tool is fed a data pipeline of realistic synthetic data to populate a Salesforce organization, which serves as the sandbox environment. The agent takes user queries and decides between an API call or a response to the users to get more clarification or provide answers.</p>
<p>"These findings suggest a significant gap between current LLM capabilities and the multifaceted demands of real-world enterprise scenarios," the paper said.</p>
<p>The findings might worry both developers and users of LLM-powered AI agents. Salesforce co-founder and CEO Marc Benioff told investors last year that AI agents represented "<a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/08/29/salesforce_pricing_per_ai_conversation/">a very high margin opportunity</a>" for the SaaS CRM vendor as it takes a share in efficiency savings accrued by customers using AI agents to help get more work out of each employee.</p>

        

<p>Elsewhere, the UK government has said it would <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/06/12/nhs_tech_spending_review/">target savings of ¬£13.8 billion ($18.7 billion) by 2029</a> with a digitization and efficiency drive that relies, in part, on the adoption of AI agents.</p>
<p>AI agents might well be useful, however, organizations should be wary of banking on any benefits before they are proven. ¬Æ</p>
