    <h3>Reporting Highlights</h3>
    <ul>
                    <li><span>A Freelance Vigilante: </span> A wilderness survival trainer spent years undercover, climbing the ranks of right-wing militias. He didn’t tell police or the FBI. He didn’t tell his family or friends.</li>
            <li><span>The Future of Militias: </span> He penetrated a new generation of militia leaders, which included doctors and government attorneys. Experts say that militias could have a renaissance under Donald Trump.</li>
            <li><span>A Secret Trove: </span> He sent ProPublica a massive trove of documents. The conversations that he secretly recorded give a unique, startling window into the militia movement.</li>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="2.0">John Williams kept a backpack filled with everything he’d need to go on the run: three pairs of socks; a few hundred dollars cash; makeshift disguises and lock-picking gear; medical supplies, vitamins and high-calorie energy gels; and thumb drives that each held more than 100 gigabytes of encrypted documents, which he would quickly distribute if he were about to be arrested or killed.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.0">On April 1, 2023, Williams retrieved the bag from his closet and rushed to his car. He had no time to clean the dishes that had accumulated in his apartment. He did not know if armed men were out looking for him. He did not know if he would ever feel safe to return. He parked his car for the night in the foothills overlooking Salt Lake City and curled up his 6-foot-4-inch frame in the back seat of the 20-year-old Honda. This was his new home.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="4.0">He turned on a recording app to add an entry to his diary. His voice had the high-pitched rasp of a lifelong smoker: “Where to fucking start,” he sighed, taking a deep breath. After more than two years undercover, he’d been growing rash and impulsive. He had feared someone was in danger and tried to warn him, but it backfired. Williams was sure at least one person knew he was a double agent now, he said into his phone. “It’s only a matter of time before it gets back to the rest.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.0">In the daylight, Williams dropped an envelope with no return address in a U.S. Postal Service mailbox. He’d loaded it with a flash drive and a gold Oath Keepers medallion. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.1">It was addressed to me.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="6.0">The documents laid out a remarkable odyssey. Posing as an ideological compatriot, Williams had penetrated the top ranks of two of the most prominent right-wing militias in the country. He’d slept in the home of the man who claims to be the new head of the Oath Keepers, rifling through his files in the middle of the night. He’d devised elaborate ruses to gather evidence of militias’ ties to high-ranking law enforcement officials. He’d uncovered secret operations like the surveillance of a young journalist, then improvised ways to sabotage the militants’ schemes. In one group, his ploys were so successful that he became the militia’s top commander in the state of Utah.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.0">Now he was a fugitive. He drove south toward a desert four hours from the city, where he could disappear.</p>

<h3><p>1. Prelude</p>
</h3>

        
    
                    
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="11.0">I’d first heard from Williams five months earlier, when he sent me an intriguing but mysterious anonymous email. “I have been attempting to contact national media and civil rights groups for over a year and been ignored,” it read. “I’m tired of yelling into the void.” He sent it to an array of reporters. I was the only one to respond. I’ve burned a lot of time sating my curiosity about emails like that. I expected my interest to die after a quick call. Instead, I came to occupy a dizzying position as the only person to know the secret Williams had been harboring for almost two years.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="12.0">We spoke a handful of times over encrypted calls before he fled. He’d been galvanized by the Jan. 6, 2021, storming of the Capitol, Williams told me, when militias like the Oath Keepers conspired to violently overturn the 2020 presidential election. He believed democracy was under siege from groups the FBI has said pose a major domestic terrorism threat. So he infiltrated the militia movement on spec, as a freelance vigilante. He did not tell the police or the FBI. A loner, he did not tell his family or friends.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="13.0">Williams seemed consumed with how to ensure this wasn’t all a self-destructive, highly dangerous waste of time. He distrusted law enforcement and didn’t want to be an informant, he said. He told me he hoped to damage the movement by someday going public with what he’d learned.</p>

    <p>We’re trying something new. <a href="https://iteratehq.com/propublica/670eabefffb484af7dc7db86">Was it helpful?</a></p>
</figure>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="15.0">The Capitol riot had been nagging at me too. I’d <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/new-details-suggest-senior-trump-aides-knew-jan-6-rally-could-get-chaotic">reported extensively on Jan. 6</a>. I’d sat with families who blamed militias for snatching their loved ones away from them, pulling them into a life of secret meetings and violent plots — or into a jail cell. By the time Williams contacted me, though, the most infamous groups appeared to have largely gone dark. Were militias more enduring, more potent, than it seemed?</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="16.0">Some of what he told me seemed significant. Still, before the package arrived, it could feel like I was corresponding with a shadow. I knew Williams treated deception as an art form. “When you spin a lie,” he once told me, “you have to have things they can verify so they won’t think to ask questions.” While his stories generally seemed precise and sober — always reassuring for a journalist — I needed to proceed with extreme skepticism.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="17.0">So I pored over his files, tens of thousands of them. They included dozens of hours of conversations he secretly recorded and years of private militia chat logs and videos. I was able to authenticate those through other sources, in and out of the movement. I also talked to dozens of people, from Williams’ friends to other members of his militias. I dug into his tumultuous past and discovered records online he hadn’t pointed me to that supported his account.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="18.0">The files give a unique window, at once expansive and intimate, into one of the <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/inside-secret-ap3-militia-american-patriots-three-percent">most consequential and volatile social movements of our time</a>. Williams penetrated a new generation of paramilitary leaders, which included doctors, career cops and government attorneys. Sometimes they were frightening, sometimes bumbling, always heavily armed. It was a world where a man would propose assassinating politicians, only to spark a debate about logistics.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="19.0">Federal prosecutors have convicted more than 1,000 people for their role in Jan. 6. Key militia captains were sent to prison for a decade or more. But that did not quash the allure that militias hold for a broad swath of Americans.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="20.0">Now President-elect Donald Trump has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/31/us/politics/trump-jan-6-pardons-nabj.html">promised to pardon Jan. 6 rioters</a> when he returns to the White House. Experts warn that such a move could trigger a renaissance for militant extremists, sending them an unprecedented message of protection and support — and making it all the more urgent to understand them.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="21.0">(Unless otherwise noted, none of the militia members mentioned in this story responded to requests for comment.)</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="22.0">Williams is part of a <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2024/08/26/infiltrating-the-far-right">larger cold war</a>, radical vs. radical, that’s stayed mostly in the shadows. A left-wing activist told me he personally knows about 30 people who’ve gone undercover in militias or white supremacist groups. They did not coordinate with law enforcement, instead taking the surveillance of one of the most intractable features of American politics into their own hands.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="23.0">Skeptical of authorities, militias have sought to reshape the country through armed action. Williams sought to do it through betrayals and lies, which sat with him uneasily. “I couldn’t have been as successful at this if I wasn’t one of them in some respects,” he once told me. “I couldn’t have done it so long unless they recognized something in me.”</p>

<h3><p>2. The Struggle</p>
</h3>

        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="25.0">If there is one moment that set Williams on his path into the militia underground, it came roughly a decade before Jan. 6, when he was sent to a medium-security prison. He was in his early 30s, drawn to danger and filled with an inner turbulence.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="26.0">Williams grew up in what he described to me, to friends and in court records as a dysfunctional and unhappy home. He was a gay child in rural America. His father viewed homosexuality as a mortal sin, he said. Williams spent much of his childhood outdoors, bird-watching, camping and trying to spend as little time as possible at home. (John Williams is now his legal name, one he recently acquired.)</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="27.0">Once he was old enough to move out, Williams continued to go off the grid for weeks at a time. Living in a cave interested him; the jobs he’d found at grocery stores and sandwich shops did not. He told me his young adulthood was “a blank space in my life,” a stretch of “petty crime” and falling-outs with old friends. He pled guilty to a series of misdemeanors: trespassing, criminal mischief, assault.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="28.0">What landed Williams in prison was how he responded to one of those arrests. He sent disturbing, anonymous emails to investigators on the case, threatening their families. Police traced the messages back to him and put him away for three years.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="29.0">Williams found time to read widely in prison — natural history books, Bertrand Russell, Cormac McCarthy. And it served as a finishing school for a skill that would be crucial in his undercover years. Surviving prison meant learning to maneuver around gang leaders and corrections officers. He learned how to steer conversations to his own benefit without the other person noticing.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="30.0">When he got out, he had a clear ambition: to become a wilderness survival instructor. He used Facebook to advertise guided hikes in Utah’s Uinta Mountains. An old photo captures Williams looking like a lanky camp counselor as he shows students an edible plant. He sports a thick ponytail and cargo pants, painted toenails poking out from his hiking sandals.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="31.0">Many people in Utah had turned to wilderness survival after a personal crisis, forming a community of misfits who thrived in environments harsh and remote. Even among them, Williams earned a reputation for putting himself in extreme situations. “Not many people are willing to struggle on their own. He takes that struggle to a high degree,” one friend told me admiringly. Williams took up krav maga and muay thai because he enjoyed fistfights. He once spent 40 days alone in the desert with only a knife, living off chipmunks and currants (by choice, to celebrate a birthday).</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="32.0">Williams struggled to get his survival business going. He’d hand out business cards at hobbyist gatherings with promises of adventure, but in practice, he was mostly leading seminars in city parks for beer money. He would only take calls in emergencies, another friend recalled, because he wanted to save money on minutes.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="33.0">Then around New Year’s in 2019, according to Williams, he received an email from a leader in American Patriots Three Percent, or AP3. He wanted to hire Williams for a training session. He could pay $1,000.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="34.0"><em>Finally</em>, Williams thought. <em>I’m starting to get some traction.</em></p>

<hr>
<h3><p>3. The Decision</p>
</h3>

        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="35.0">They had agreed there’d be no semiautomatic rifles, Williams told me, so everyone brought a sidearm. Some dozen militiamen had driven into the mountains near Peter Sinks, Utah, one of the coldest places in the contiguous U.S. Initially they wanted training in evasion and escape, Williams said, but he thought they needed to work up to that. So for three days, he taught them the basics of wilderness survival, but with a twist: how to stay alive while “trying to stay hidden.” He showed them how to build a shelter that would both keep them dry and escape detection. How to make a fire, then how to clean it up so no one could tell it was ever there.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="36.0">As the days wore on, stray comments started to irk him. Once, a man said he’d been “kiked” into overpaying for his Ruger handgun. At the end of the training, AP3 leaders handed out matching patches. The ritual reminded Williams of a biker gang.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="37.0">He’d already been to some shorter AP3 events to meet the men and tailor the lesson to his first meaningful client, Williams told me. But spending days in the woods with them felt different. He said he found the experience unpleasant and decided not to work with the group again.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="40.0">This portion of Williams’ story — exactly how and why he first became a militia member — is the hardest to verify. By his own account, he kept his thoughts and plans entirely to himself. At the time, he was too embarrassed to even tell his friends what happened that weekend, he said. In the survival community, training militias was considered taboo.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="41.0">I couldn’t help but wonder if Williams was hiding a less gallant backstory. Maybe he’d joined AP3 out of genuine enthusiasm and then soured on it. Maybe now he was trying to fool me. Indeed, when I called the AP3 leader who set up the training, he disputed Williams’ timeline. He remembered Williams staying sporadically but consistently involved after the session in the mountains, as a friend of the group who attended two or three events a year. To further muddy the picture, Williams had warned me the man would say something like that — Williams had worked hard to create the impression that he never left, he said, that he’d just gone inactive for a while, busy with work. (Remarkably, the AP3er defended Williams’ loyalty each time I asserted he’d secretly tried to undermine the group. “He was very well-respected,” he said. “I never questioned his honesty or his intentions.”)</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="42.0">Even Williams’ friends told me he was something of a mystery to them. But I found evidence that supports his story where so many loners bare their innermost thoughts: the internet. In 2019 and early 2020, Williams wrote thousands of since-deleted entries in online forums. These posts delivered a snapshot of his worldview in this period: idiosyncratic, erudite and angry with little room for moderation. “There are occasionally militia types that want these skills to further violent fringe agendas and I will absolutely not enable them,” he wrote in one 2020 entry about wilderness survival. In another, he called AP3 and its allies “far right lunatics.” The posts didn’t prove the details of his account, but here was the Williams I knew, writing under pseudonyms long before we’d met.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="43.0">One day, he’d voice his disdain for Trump voters, neoliberalism or “the capitalist infrastructure.” Another, he’d rail against gun control measures as immoral. When Black Lives Matter protests broke out in 2020, Williams wrote that he was gathering medical supplies for local protestors. He sounded at times like a revolutionary crossed with a left-wing liberal arts student. “The sole job of a cop is to bully citizens on behalf of the state,” he wrote. “Violent overthrow of the state is our only viable option.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="44.0">Then came Jan. 6. As he was watching on TV, he later told me, Williams thought he recognized the patch on a rioter’s tactical vest. It looked like the one that AP3 leaders had handed out at the end of his training.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="45.0"><em>Did I teach that guy?</em> he wondered. <em>Why was I so cordial to them all?</em> <em>If they knew I was gay, I bet they’d want me dead, and I actually helped them</em>. <em>Because I was too selfish to think of anything but my career</em>.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="46.0">Shame quickly turned to anger, he told me, and to a desire for revenge. Pundits were saying that democracy itself was in mortal peril. Williams took that notion literally. He assumed countless Americans would respond with aggressive action, he said, and he wanted to be among them.</p>
        
    
                    
<hr>
<h3><p>4. A New World</p>
</h3>
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="47.1">Williams stood alone in his apartment, watching himself in the mirror.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="47.2">“I’m tall.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="47.3">“I’m Dave.” </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="47.4">“I’m tall.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="47.5">“I’m Dave.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="47.6">He tried to focus on his mannerisms, on the intonation of his voice. Whether he was saying the truth or a falsehood, he wanted to appear exactly the same.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="48.0">Months had passed since the Capitol riot. By all appearances, Williams was now an enthusiastic member of AP3. Because he already had an in, joining the group was easy, he said. Becoming a self-fashioned spy took some trial and error, however. In the early days, he had posed as a homeless person to surveil militia training facilities, but he decided that was a waste of time.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="49.0">The casual deceit that had served him in prison was proving useful. Deviousness was a skill, and he stayed up late working to hone it. He kept a journal with every lie he told so he wouldn’t lose track. His syllabus centered on acting exercises and the history of espionage and cults. People like sex cult leader Keith Raniere impressed him most — he studied biographies to learn how they manipulated people, how they used cruelty to wear their followers down into acquiescence.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="50.0">Williams regularly berated the militia’s rank and file. He doled out condescending advice about the group’s security weaknesses, warning their technical incompetence would make them easy targets for left-wing hackers and government snoops. Orion Rollins, the militia’s top leader in Utah, soon messaged Williams to thank him for the guidance. “Don’t worry about being a dick,” he wrote. “It’s time to learn and become as untraceable as possible.” (The AP3 messages Williams sent me were so voluminous that I spent an entire month reading them before I noticed this exchange.)</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="51.0">Williams was entering the militia at a pivotal time. AP3 once had chapters in nearly every state, with a roster likely in the tens of thousands; as authorities cracked down on the movement after Jan. 6, membership was plummeting. Some who stayed on had white nationalist ties. Others were just lonely conservatives who had found purpose in the paramilitary cause. For now, the group’s leaders were focused on saving the militia, not taking up arms to fight their enemies. (Thanks to Williams’ trove and records from several other sources, I was eventually able to write <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/inside-secret-ap3-militia-american-patriots-three-percent">an investigation into AP3’s resurgence</a>.)</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="52.0">On March 4, 2021, Williams complained to Rollins that everyone was still ignoring his advice. Williams volunteered to take over as the state’s “intel officer,” responsible for protecting the group from outside scrutiny.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="53.0">“My hands are tied,” Williams wrote. “If I’m not able to” take charge, the whole militia “might unravel.” Rollins gave him the promotion.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="54.0">“Thanks Orion. You’ve shown good initiative here.” Privately, he saw a special advantage to his appointment. If anyone suspected there was a mole in Utah, Williams would be the natural choice to lead the mole hunt.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="55.0">Now he had a leadership role. What he did not yet have was a plan. But how could he decide on goals, he figured, until he knew more about AP3? He would work to gather information and rise through the ranks by being the best militia member he could be.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="56.0">He took note of the job titles of leaders he met, like an Air Force reserve master sergeant (I confirmed this through military records) who recruited other airmen into the movement. Williams attended paramilitary trainings, where the group practiced ambushes with improvised explosives and semiautomatic guns. He offered his comrades free lessons in hand-to-hand combat and bonded with them in the backcountry hunting jackrabbits. When the militia joined right-wing rallies for causes like gun rights, they went in tactical gear. Williams attended as their “gray man,” he said — assigned to blend in with the crowd and call in armed reinforcements if tensions erupted.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="57.0">Since his work was seasonal, Williams could spend as much as 40 hours a week on militia activities. One of his duties as intel officer was to monitor the group’s enemies on the left, which could induce vertigo. A militia leader once dispatched him to a Democratic Socialists of America meeting at a local library, he said, where he saw a Proud Boy he recognized from a joint militia training. Was this a closet right-winger keeping tabs on the socialists? Or a closet leftist who might dox him or inform the police?</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="58.0">He first contacted me in October 2022. He couldn’t see how the movement was changing beyond his corner of Utah. AP3 was reinvigorated by then, I later found, with as many as 50 recruits applying each day. In private chats I reviewed, leaders were debating if they should commit acts of terrorism. At the Texas border, members were rounding up immigrants in armed patrols. But Williams didn’t know all that yet. On our first call, he launched into a litany of minutiae: names, logistical details, allegations of minor players committing petty crimes. He could tell I wasn’t sure what it all amounted to.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="59.0">Williams feared that if anything he’d helped AP3, not damaged it. Then, in early November, Rollins told him to contact a retired detective named Bobby Kinch.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="63.1">Williams turned on a recording device and dialed. Kinch picked up after one ring: ​​“What’s going on?” he bellowed. “How you doing, man?” </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="63.2">“I don’t know if you remember me,” Kinch continued, but they’d met years before.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="63.3">“Oh, oh, back in the day,” Williams said, stuttering for a second. He knew Kinch was expecting the call but was confused by the warm reception. Maybe Kinch was at the training in 2019? </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="63.4">“Well I’m the sitting, current national director of the Oath Keepers now.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="64.0">The militia’s eye-patched founder, Stewart Rhodes, was in jail amid his trial for conspiring to overthrow the government on Jan. 6. Kinch said he was serving on the group’s national board when his predecessor was arrested. Rhodes had called from jail to say, “Do not worry about me. This is God’s way.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="65.0">“He goes, ‘But I want you to save the organization.’”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="66.0">Kinch explained that Rollins, who’d recently defected to the Oath Keepers, had been singing Williams’ praises. (Bound by shared ideology, militias are more porous than outsiders would think. Members often cycle between groups like square dance partners.) “I imagine your plate is full with all the crazy stuff going on in the world, but I’d love to sit down.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="67.0">“Yeah, yeah,” Williams said. “AP3 and Oath Keepers should definitely be working together.” He proposed forming a joint reconnaissance team so their two militias could collaborate on intelligence operations. Kinch lit up. “I’m a career cop,” he said. “I did a lot of covert stuff, surveillance.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="68.0">By the time they hung up 45 minutes later, Kinch had invited Williams to come stay at his home. Williams felt impressed with himself. The head of the most infamous militia in America was treating him like an old friend.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="69.0">To me, Williams sounded like a different person on the call, with the same voice but a brand new personality. It was the first recording that I listened to and the first time I became certain the most important part of his story was true. To authenticate the record, I independently confirmed nonpublic details Kinch discussed on the tape, a process I repeated again and again with the other files. Soon I had proof of what would otherwise seem outlandish: Williams’ access was just as deep as he claimed.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="70.0">I could see why people would be eager to follow Kinch. Even when he sermonized on the “global elitist cabal,” he spoke with the affable passion of a beloved high school teacher. I’d long been fascinated by the prevalence of cops on militia rosters, so I started examining his backstory.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="71.0">Kinch grew up in upstate New York, the son of a World War II veteran who had him at about 50. When Kinch was young, he confided in a later recording, he was a “wheelman,” slang for getaway driver. “I ran from the cops so many fucking times,” he said. But “at the end of the day, you know, I got away. I never got caught.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="72.0">He moved to Las Vegas and, at the age of 25, became an officer in the metro police. Kinch came to serve in elite detective units over 23 years in the force, hunting fugitives and helping take down gangs like the Playboy Bloods. Eventually he was assigned to what he called the “Black squad,” according to court records, tasked with investigating violent crimes where the suspect was African American. (A Las Vegas police spokesperson told me they stopped “dividing squads by a suspect’s race” a year before Kinch retired.)</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="73.0">Then around Christmas in 2013, Kinch’s career began to self-destruct. In a series of Facebook posts, he said that he would welcome a “race war.” “Bring it!” he wrote. “I’m about as fed up as a man (American, Christian, White, Heterosexual) can get!” An ensuing investigation prompted the department to tell the Secret Service that Kinch “could be a threat to the president,” according to the Las Vegas Sun. (The Secret Service interviewed him and determined he was not a threat to President Barack Obama, the outlet reported. Kinch told the paper he was not racist and that he was being targeted by colleagues with “an ax to grind.”) In 2016, he turned in his badge, a year after the saga broke in the local press.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="74.0">Kinch moved to southern Utah and found a job hawking hunting gear at a Sportsman’s Warehouse. But he “had this urge,” he later said on a right-wing podcast. “Like I wasn’t done yet.” So he joined the Oath Keepers. “When people tell me that violence doesn’t solve anything, I look back over my police career,” he once advised his followers. “And I’m like, ‘Wow, that’s interesting, because violence did solve quite a bit.’”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="75.0">Kinch added Williams to an encrypted Signal channel where the Utah Oath Keepers coordinated their intel work. Two weeks later on Nov. 30, 2022, Williams received a cryptic message from David Coates, one of Kinch’s top deputies.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="76.0">Coates was an elder statesman of sorts in the Oath Keepers, a 73-year-old Vietnam veteran with a Hulk Hogan mustache. There’d been a break-in at the Utah attorney general’s office, he reported to the group, and for some unspoken reason, the Oath Keepers seemed to think this was of direct relevance to them. Coates promised to find out more about the burglary: “The Sheriff should have some answers” to “my inquiries today or tomorrow.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="77.0">That last line would come to obsess Williams. He sent a long, made-up note about his own experiences collaborating with law enforcement officials. “I’m curious, how responsive is the Sheriff to your inquiries? Or do you have a source you work with?”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="78.0">“The Sheriff has become a personal friend who hosted my FBI interview,” Coates responded. “He opens a lot of doors.” Coates had been in D.C. on Jan. 6, he’d told Williams. It’d make sense if that had piqued the FBI’s interest.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="79.0">To Williams, it hinted at a more menacing scenario — at secret ties between those who threaten the rule of the law and those duty-bound to enforce it. He desperately wanted more details, more context, the sheriff’s name. But he didn’t want to push for too much too fast.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="82.0">A forest engulfed Kinch’s house on all sides. He lived in a half-million-dollar cabin in summer home country, up 8,000 feet in the mountains outside Zion National Park. Williams stood in the kitchen on a mid-December Saturday morning.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="83.0">Williams had recently made a secret purchase of a small black device off Amazon. It looked like a USB drive. The on-off switch and microphone holes revealed what it really was: a bug. As the two men chatted over cups of cannoli-flavored coffee, Williams didn’t notice when Kinch’s dog snatched the bug from his bag.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="84.0">The night before, Williams had slept in the guest room. The house was cluttered with semiautomatic rifles. He had risked photographing three plaques on the walls inscribed with the same Ernest Hemingway line. “There is no hunting like the hunting of man,” they read. “Those who have hunted armed men long enough and liked it, never really care for anything else.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="85.0">They spotted the dog at the same time. The bug was attached to a charging device. The animal was running around with it like it was a tennis ball. As Kinch went to retrieve it, Williams felt panic grip his chest. Could anyone talk their way out of this? He’d learned enough about Kinch to be terrified of his rage. Looking around, Williams eyed his host’s handgun on the kitchen counter.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="86.0"><em>If he even starts to examine it, I’ll grab the gun,</em> he thought. <em>Then I’ll shoot him and flee into the woods.</em></p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="86.1">Kinch took the bug from the dog’s mouth. Then he handed it right to Williams and started to apologize.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="86.2">Don’t worry about it, Williams said. He’s a puppy!</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="89.0">On their way out the door, Kinch grabbed the pistol and placed it in the console of his truck. It was an hour’s drive to the nearest city, where the Oath Keepers were holding a leadership meeting. Williams rode shotgun, his bug hooked onto the zipper of his backpack. On the tape, I could hear the wind racing through the car window. The radio played Bryan Adams’ “Summer of ’69.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="90.0">Kinch seemed in the hold of a dark nostalgia — as if he was wrestling with the monotony of civilian life, with the new strictures he faced since turning in his badge. Twenty minutes in, he recited the Hemingway line like it was a mantra. “I have a harder time killing animals than a human being,” Kinch continued. Then he grew quiet as he recounted the night he decided to retire.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="91.0">He’d woken up in an oleander bush with no memory of how he’d gotten there. His hands were covered in blood. He was holding a gun. “I had to literally take my magazine out and count my bullets, make sure I didn’t fucking kill somebody,” he said. “I black out when I get angry. And I don’t remember what the fuck I did.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="92.0">Kinch went on: “I love the adrenaline of police work,” and then he paused. “I miss it. It was a hoot.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="93.0">By the time they reached Cedar City, Utah, Kinch was back to charismatic form. He dished out compliments to the dozen or so Oath Keepers assembled for the meeting — “You look like you lost weight” — and told everyone to put their phones in their cars. “It’s just good practice. Because at some point we may have to go down a route,” one of his deputies explained, trailing off.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="94.0">Kinch introduced Williams to the group. “He’s not the feds. And if he is, he’s doing a damn good job.” </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="94.1">Williams laughed, a little too loud.</p>

<hr>
<h3><p>7. Doctor, Lawyer, Sergeant, Spy</p>
</h3>

        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="95.0">Early in the meeting, Kinch laid out his vision for the Oath Keepers’ role in American life. “We have a two-edged sword,” he said. The “dull edge” was more traditional grassroots work, exemplified by efforts to combat alleged election fraud. He hoped to build their political apparatus so that in five or 10 years, conservative candidates would be seeking the Oath Keepers’ endorsement.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="96.0">Then there was the sharp edge: paramilitary training. “You hone all these skills because when the dull edge fails, you’ve got to be able to turn that around and be sharp.” The room smelled like donuts, one of the men had remarked.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="99.0">The week before, Kinch’s predecessor had been convicted of seditious conspiracy. This was their first meeting since the verdict, and I opened the recordings later with the same anticipation I feel sitting down for the Super Bowl. What would come next for the militia after this historic trial: ruin, recovery or revolt?</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="100.0">The stature of men leading the group’s post-Jan. 6 resurrection startled me. I was expecting the ex-cops, like the one from Fresno, California, who said he stayed on with the militia because “this defines me.” Militias tend to prize law enforcement ties; during an armed operation, it could be useful to have police see you as a friend.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="101.0">But there was also an Ohio OB-GYN on the national board of directors — he used to work for the Cleveland Clinic, I discovered, and now led a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group. The doctor was joined at board meetings by a city prosecutor in Utah, an ex-city council member and, Williams was later told, a sergeant with an Illinois sheriff’s department. (The doctor did not respond to requests for comment. He has since left his post with the UnitedHealth subsidiary, a spokesperson for the company said.)</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="102.0">Over six hours, the men set goals and delegated responsibilities with surprisingly little worry about the federal crackdown on militias. They discussed the scourges they were there to combat (stolen elections, drag shows, President Joe Biden) only in asides. Instead, they focused on “marketing” — “So what buzzwords can we insert in our mission statement?” one asked — and on resources that’d help local chapters rapidly expand. “I’d like to see this organization be like the McDonald’s of patriot organizations,” another added. To Williams, it felt more like a Verizon sales meeting than an insurrectionist cell.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="103.0">Kinch had only recently taken over and as I listened, I wondered how many followers he really had outside of that room. They hadn’t had a recruitment drive in the past year, which they resolved to change. They had $1,700 in the bank. But it didn’t seem entirely bravado. Kinch and his comrades mentioned conversations with chapters around the county.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="104.0">Then as they turned from their weakened national presence to their recent successes in Utah, Williams snapped to attention.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="104.1">“We had surveillance operations,” Kinch said, without elaboration.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="105.0">“We’re making progress locally on the law enforcement,” Coates added. He said that at least three of them can get “the sheriff” on the phone any time of day. Like the last time, Coates didn’t give a name, but he said something even more intriguing: “The sheriff is my tie-in to the state attorney general because he’s friends.” Williams told me he fought the urge to lob a question. (The attorney general’s office did not respond to requests for comment.)</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="106.0">Closing out the day, Kinch summarized their plan moving forward: Keep a low profile. Focus on the unglamorous work. Rebuild their national footprint. And patiently prepare for 2024. “We still got what, two more years, till another quote unquote election?” He thanked Williams for coming and asked if they could start planning training exercises.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="107.0">“Absolutely, yeah, I’m excited about that.” Williams was resolved to find his way onto the national board.</p>

<h3><p>8. The Stakeout</p>
</h3>

        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="108.0">On Dec. 17, 2022, a week after the meeting, Williams called a tech-savvy 19-year-old Oath Keeper named Rowan. He’d told Rowan he was going to teach him to infiltrate leftist groups, but Williams’ real goal was far more underhanded. While the older Oath Keepers had demurred at his most sensitive questions recently, the teenager seemed eager to impress a grizzled survival instructor. By assigning missions to Rowan, he hoped to probe the militias’ secrets without casting suspicion on himself.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="109.0">“You don’t quite have the life experience to do this,” Williams opened on the recording. But with a couple years’ training, “I think we can work towards that goal.” He assigned his student a scholarly monograph, “Alienation: Marx’s Conception of Man in a Capitalist Society,” to begin his long education in how leftists think. “Perfect,” Rowan responded. He paused to write the title down.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="110.0">Then came his pupil’s first exercise: build a dossier on Williams’ boss in AP3. Williams explained it was safest to practice on people they knew.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="111.0">In Rowan, Williams had found a particularly vulnerable target. He was on probation at the time. According to court records, earlier that year, Rowan had walked up to a stranger’s truck as she was leaving her driveway. She rolled down her window. He punched her several times in the face. When police arrived, Rowan began screaming that he was going to kill them and threatened to “blow up the police department.” He was convicted of misdemeanor assault.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="112.0">Williams felt guilty about using the young man but also excited. (“He is completely in my palm,” he recorded in his diary.) Within a few weeks, he had Rowan digging into Kinch’s background. “I’m going to gradually have him do more and more things,” he said in the diary, “with the hopes that I can eventually get him to hack” into militia leaders’ accounts.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="113.0">The relationship quickly unearthed something that disturbed him. The week of their call, Williams woke up to a series of angry messages in the Oath Keepers’ encrypted Signal channel. The ire was directed toward a Salt Lake Tribune reporter who, according to Coates, was “a real piece of shit.” His sins included critical coverage of “anyone trying to expose voter fraud” and writing about a local political figure who’d appeared on a leaked Oath Keepers roster.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="114.0">Williams messaged Rowan. “I noticed in the chat that there is some kind of red list of journalists etc? Could you get that to me?” he asked. “It would be very helpful to my safety when observing political rallies or infiltrating leftists.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="115.0">“Ah yes, i have doxes on many journalists in utah,” Rowan responded, using slang for sharing someone’s personal data with malicious intent.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="116.0">He sent over a dossier on the Tribune reporter, which opened with a brief manifesto: “This dox goes out to those that have been terrorized, doxed, harassed, slandered, and family names mutilated by these people.” It provided the reporter’s address and phone number, along with two pictures of his house.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="117.0">Then Rowan shared similar documents about a local film critic — he’d posted a “snarky” retweet of the Tribune writer — and about a student reporter at Southern Utah University. The college student had covered a rally the Oath Keepers recently attended, Rowan explained, and the militia believed he was coordinating with the Tribune. “We found the car he drove through a few other members that did a stakeout.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="118.0">“That’s awesome,” Williams said. Internally, he was reeling: a stakeout? In the dossier, he found a backgrounder on the student’s parents along with their address. Had armed men followed this kid around? Did they surveil his family home?</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="119.0">His notes show him wrestling with a decision he hadn’t let himself reckon with before: Was it time to stop being a fly on the wall and start taking action? Did he need to warn someone? The journalists? The police? Breaking character would open the door to disaster. The incident with Kinch’s dog had been a chilling reminder of the risks.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="120.0">Williams had been in the militia too long. He was losing his sense of objectivity. The messages were alarming, but were they an imminent threat? He couldn’t tell. Williams had made plans to leave Utah if his cover was blown. He didn’t want to jeopardize two years of effort over a false alarm. But what if he did nothing and this kid got hurt?</p>
        
    
                    
<hr>
<h3><p>9. The Plan</p>
</h3>

        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="122.0">By 2023, Williams’ responsibilities were expanding as rapidly as his anxiety. His schedule was packed with events for AP3, the Oath Keepers and a third militia he’d recently gotten inside. He vowed to infiltrate the Proud Boys and got Coates to vouch for him with the local chapter. He prepared plans to penetrate a notorious white supremacist group too.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="123.0">His adversaries were gaining momentum as well. Williams soon made the four-hour drive to Kinch’s house for another leadership meeting and was told on tape about a national Oath Keepers recruiting bump; they’d also found contact information for 40,000 former members, which they hoped to use to bring a flood of militiamen back into the fold.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="124.0">Despite the risk to his own safety and progress, Williams decided to send the journalists anonymous warnings from burner accounts. He attached sensitive screenshots so that they’d take him seriously. And then … nothing. The reporters never responded; he wondered if the messages went to spam. His secret was still secure.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="125.0">But the point of his mission was finally coming into focus. He was done simply playing the part of model militia member. His plan had two parts: After gathering as much compromising information as he could, he would someday release it all online, he told me. He carefully documented anything that looked legally questionable, hoping law enforcement would find something useful for a criminal case. At the very least, going public could make militiamen more suspicious of each other.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="126.0">In the meantime, he would undermine the movement from the inside. He began trying to blunt the danger that he saw lurking in every volatile situation the militiamen put themselves in.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="127.0">On Jan. 27, 2023, body camera footage from the police killing of Tyre Nichols, an unarmed Black man, became public. “The footage is gruesome and distressing,” The New York Times reported. “Cities across the U.S. are bracing for protests.” The militias had often responded to Black Lives Matter rallies with street brawls and armed patrols.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="128.0">Williams had visions of Kyle Rittenhouse-esque shootings in the streets. He put his newly formulated strategy into action, sending messages to militiamen around the country with made-up rumors he hoped would persuade them to stay home.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="129.0">In Utah, he wrote to Kinch and the leaders of his other two militias. He would be undercover at the protests in Salt Lake City, he wrote. If any militiamen went, even “a brief look of recognition could blow my cover and put my life in danger.” All three ordered their troops to avoid the event. (“This is a bit of a bummer,” one AP3 member responded. “I’ve got some aggression built up I need to let out.”)</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="130.0">After the protests, Williams turned on his voice diary and let out a long sigh. For weeks, he’d been nauseous and had trouble eating. He’d developed insomnia that would keep him up until dawn. He’d gone to the rally to watch for militia activity. When he got home, he’d vomited blood.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="131.0">Even grocery shopping took hours now. He circled the aisles to check if he was being tailed. Once while driving, he thought he caught someone following him. He’d reached out to a therapist to help “relieve some of this pressure,” he said, but was afraid to speak candidly with him. “I can check his office for bugs and get his electronics out of the office. And then once we’re free, I can tell him what’s going on.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="132.0">He quickly launched into a litany of items on his to-do list. A training exercise to attend. A recording device he needed to find a way to install. “I’m just fucking sick of being around these toxic motherfuckers.”</p>

<h3><p>10. The Deep State</p>
</h3>

        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="137.0">On March 20, Williams called Scot Seddon, the founder of AP3. If he was on the verge of a breakdown, it didn’t impact his performance. I could tell when Williams was trying to advance his agenda as I listened later, but he was subtle about it. Obsequious. Methodical. By day’s end, he’d achieved perhaps his most remarkable feat yet. He’d helped persuade Seddon and his lieutenants to fire the head of AP3’s Utah chapter and to install Williams in his place.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="138.0">Now he had access to sensitive records only senior militia leaders could see. He had final say over the group’s actions in an entire state. He knew the coup would make him vastly more effective. Yet that night in his voice diary, Williams sounded like a man in despair.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="139.0">The success only added to his paranoia. Becoming a major figure in the Utah militia scene raised a possibility he couldn’t countenance: He might be arrested and sent to jail for some action of his comrades.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="140.0">With a sense of urgency now, he focused even more intently on militia ties to government authorities. “I have been still collecting evidence on the paramilitaries’ use of law enforcement,” he said in the diary entry. “It’s way deeper than I thought.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="141.0">He solved the mystery of the Oath Keepers’ “sheriff”: It was the sheriff for Iron County, Utah, a tourist hub near two national parks. He assigned Rowan to dig deeper into the official’s ties with the movement and come back with emails or text messages. (In a recent interview, the sheriff told me that he declined an offer to join the Oath Keepers but that he’s known “quite a few” members and thinks “they’re generally good people.” Coates has periodically contacted him about issues like firearms rules that Coates believes are unconstitutional, the sheriff said. “If I agree, I contact the attorney general’s office.”)</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="142.0">Claiming to work on “a communication strategy for reaching out to law enforcement,” Williams then goaded AP3 members into bragging about their police connections. They told him about their ties with high-ranking officers in Missouri and in Louisiana, in Texas and in Tennessee.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="143.0">The revelations terrified him. “When this gets out, I think I’m probably going to flee overseas,” he said in his diary. “They have too many connections.” What if a cop ally helped militants track him down? “I don’t think I can safely stay within the United States.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="144.0">Four days later, he tuned into a Zoom seminar put on by a fellow AP3 leader. It was a rambling and sparsely attended meeting. But 45 minutes in, a woman brought up an issue in her Virginia hometown, population 23,000.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="145.0">The town’s vice mayor, a proud election denier, was under fire for a homophobic remark. She believed a local reporter covering the controversy was leading a secret far-left plot. What’s more, the reporter happened to be her neighbor. To intimidate her, she said, he’d been leaving dead animals on her lawn.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="146.0">“I think I have to settle a score with this guy,” she concluded. “They’re getting down to deep state local level and it’s got to be stopped.” After the call, Williams went to turn off his recording device. “Well, that was fucking insane,” he said aloud.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="147.0">He soon reached out to the woman to offer his advice. Maybe he could talk her down, Williams thought, or at least determine what she meant by settling a score. But she wasn’t interested in speaking with him. So again he faced a choice: do nothing or risk his cover being blown. He finally came to the same conclusion he had the last time he’d feared journalists were in jeopardy. On March 31, he sent an anonymous warning.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="148.0">“Because she is a member of a right wing militia group and is heavily armed, I wanted to let you know,” Williams wrote to the reporter. “I believe her to be severely mentally ill and I believe her to be dangerous. For my own safety, I cannot reveal more.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="149.0">He saw the article the next morning. The journalist had published 500 words about the disturbing email he’d gotten, complete with a screenshot of Williams’ entire note. Only a few people had joined that meandering call. Surely only Williams pestered the woman about it afterwards. There could be little doubt that he was the mole.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="150.0">He pulled the go bag from his closet and fled. A few days later, while on the run, Williams recorded the final entries in his diary. Amid the upheaval, he sounded surprised to feel a sense of relief: “I see the light at the end of the tunnel for the first time in two and a half years.”</p>

<h3><p>Coda: Project 2025</p>
</h3>

        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="152.0">It was seven days before the 2024 presidential election. Williams had insisted I not bring my phone, on the off chance my movements were being tracked. We were finally meeting for the first time, in a city that he asked me not to disclose. He entered the cramped hotel room wearing a camo hat, hiking shoes and a “Spy vs. Spy” comic strip T-shirt. “Did you pick the shirt to match the occasion?” I asked. He laughed. “Sometimes I can’t help myself.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="155.0">We talked for days, with Williams splayed across a Best Western office chair beside the queen bed. He evoked an aging computer programmer with 100 pounds of muscle attached, and he seemed calmer than on the phone, endearingly offbeat. The vision he laid out — of his own future and of the country’s — was severe.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="156.0">After he dropped everything and went underground, Williams spent a few weeks in the desert. He threw his phone in a river, flushed documents down the toilet and switched apartments when he returned to civilization. At first, he spent every night by the door ready for an attack; if anyone found him and ambushed him, it’d happen after dark, he figured. No one ever came, and he began to question if he’d needed to flee at all. The insomnia of his undercover years finally abated. He began to sketch out the rest of his life.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="157.0">Initially, he hoped to connect with lawmakers in Washington, helping them craft legislation to combat the militia movement. By last summer, those ambitions had waned. Over time, he began to wrestle with his gift for deceiving people who trusted him. “I don’t necessarily like what it says about me that I have a talent for this,” he said.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="158.0">To me, it seemed that the ordeal might be starting to change him. He’d become less precise in consistently adhering to the facts in recent weeks, I thought, more grandiose in his account of his own saga. But then for long stretches, he’d speak with the same introspection and attention to detail that he showed on our first calls. His obsession with keeping the Tyre Nichols protestors safe was myopic, he told me, a case of forgetting the big picture to quash the few dangers he could control.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="159.0">Williams believes extremists will try to murder him after this story is published. And if they fail, he thinks he’ll “live to see the United States cease to exist.” He identifies with the violent abolitionist John Brown, who tried to start a slave revolt two years before the American Civil War and was executed. Williams thinks he himself may not be seen as such a radical soon, he told me. “I wonder if I’m maybe a little too early.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="160.0">I’d thought Williams was considering a return to a quiet life. Our two intense years together had been a strain sometimes even for me. But in the hotel room, he explained his plans for future operations against militias: “Until they kill me, this is what I’m doing.” He hopes to inspire others to follow in his footsteps and even start his own vigilante collective, running his own “agents” inside the far right.</p>
        
    
                                  
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="162.0">In August, I published my <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/inside-secret-ap3-militia-american-patriots-three-percent">investigation into AP3</a>. (I used his records but did not otherwise rely on Williams as an anonymous source.) It was a way of starting to lay out what I’d learned since his first email: what’s driving the growth of militias, how they keep such a wide range of people united, the dangerous exploits that they’ve managed to keep out of public view.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="163.0">Two months later, Williams published an anonymous essay. He revealed that he’d infiltrated the group as an “independent activist” and had sent me files. He wanted to test how the militia would respond to news of a mole.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="164.0">The result was something he long had hoped for: a wave of paranoia inside AP3. “It’s a fucking risky thing we get involved in,” Seddon, the group’s founder, said in a private message. “Fucking trust nobody. There’s fucking turncoats everywhere.” (Seddon declined to comment for this story. He then sent a short follow-up email: “MAGA.”)</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="165.0">Sowing that distrust is why Williams is going on the record, albeit without his original name. He still plans to release thousands of files after this article is published — evidence tying sheriffs and police officers to the movement, his proudest coup, plus other records he hopes could become ammo for lawsuits. But Williams wants to let his former comrades know “a faggot is doing this to them.” He thinks his story could be his most effective weapon.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="166.0">Every time militia members make a phone call, attend a meeting or go to a gun range together, he wants them “to be thinking, in the back of their heads, ‘This guy will betray me.’”</p>

For example in the game Sable, outlines are used to create a comic-book-like style. In The Last of Us, outlines are used to highlight enemies when the player goes into stealth mode.</p><p>In this post, I will discuss 5 techniques for rendering an outline around an object.</p><blockquote><p>🖍️ Interested in an outline rendering toolkit for Unity? 3 years after making this post <a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/slug/294140?aid=1011l3n8v&amp;pubref=site" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I made Linework</a>!</p></blockquote><h2 id="rim-effects" tabindex="-1"><a href="#rim-effects" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Jump to heading</span>  </a>Rim Effects</h2><p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://ameye.dev/notes/rendering-outlines/rim-effect/final.png-400w.webp 400w, https://ameye.dev/notes/rendering-outlines/rim-effect/final.png-800w.webp 800w, https://ameye.dev/notes/rendering-outlines/rim-effect/final.png-1200w.webp 1200w, https://ameye.dev/notes/rendering-outlines/rim-effect/final.png-1907w.webp 1907w" sizes="(min-width: 30em) 50vw, 100vw"><img alt="Rim effect outline." loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://ameye.dev/notes/rendering-outlines/rim-effect/final.png-400w.jpeg" width="1907" height="748" srcset="https://ameye.dev/notes/rendering-outlines/rim-effect/final.png-400w.jpeg 400w, https://ameye.dev/notes/rendering-outlines/rim-effect/final.png-800w.jpeg 800w, https://ameye.dev/notes/rendering-outlines/rim-effect/final.png-1200w.jpeg 1200w, https://ameye.dev/notes/rendering-outlines/rim-effect/final.png-1907w.jpeg 1907w" sizes="(min-width: 30em) 50vw, 100vw"></picture></p><h3 id="technique" tabindex="-1"><a href="#technique" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Jump to heading</span>  </a>Technique</h3><p>One of the most basic outline effects can be achieved by using a so called <mark>fresnel effect</mark> which can be used to render an outline on the rim/edge of an object. The fresnel effect describes the reflection/transmission of light when falling onto a transparent surface. However, when using it for rendering outlines, this physical meaning of the effect is not important. The following formula is used to form the outline.</p><p><span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><semantics><mrow><mi>O</mi><mi>u</mi><mi>t</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>p</mi><mi>o</mi><mi>w</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mn>1.0</mn><mo>−</mo><mi>s</mi><mi>a</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>u</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>a</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>e</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>d</mi><mi>o</mi><mi>t</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>N</mi><mo separator="true">,</mo><mi>V</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo separator="true">,</mo><mi>P</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">Out = pow((1.0 - saturate(dot(N, V))), P)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span></p><p>The formula takes the dot product between the normalized normal vector <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>N</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">N</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and the normalized view direction <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>V</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">V</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.

By controlling the width, power and softness of the outline, it is possible to create hard lines or a more soft/glowy effect.</p><p>Characteristic for this approach is that it works well for objects like spheres and capsules with smooth and round edges, but it breaks down for objects like cubes or more complex models that have sharp edges.</p><p>For a cube for example, the outline will look really bad and not even resemble an outline. For a more complex model, you will have the issue of getting lots of uneven line widths, although the overall outline effect can look alright.</p><blockquote><p><strong>💬 Rim effect</strong> outlines are simple but only work well on spherical objects.</p></blockquote><h2 id="vertex-extrusion" tabindex="-1"><a href="#vertex-extrusion" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Jump to heading</span>  </a>Vertex Extrusion</h2><p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://ameye.dev/notes/rendering-outlines/vertex-extrusion/final.png-400w.webp 400w, https://ameye.dev/notes/rendering-outlines/vertex-extrusion/final.png-800w.webp 800w, https://ameye.dev/notes/rendering-outlines/vertex-extrusion/final.png-1200w.webp 1200w, https://ameye.dev/notes/rendering-outlines/vertex-extrusion/final.png-4148w.webp 4148w" sizes="(min-width: 30em) 50vw, 100vw"><img alt="Vertex extrusion outline." loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://ameye.dev/notes/rendering-outlines/vertex-extrusion/final.png-400w.jpeg" width="4148" height="1648" srcset="https://ameye.dev/notes/rendering-outlines/vertex-extrusion/final.png-400w.jpeg 400w, https://ameye.dev/notes/rendering-outlines/vertex-extrusion/final.png-800w.jpeg 800w, https://ameye.dev/notes/rendering-outlines/vertex-extrusion/final.png-1200w.jpeg 1200w, https://ameye.dev/notes/rendering-outlines/vertex-extrusion/final.png-4148w.jpeg 4148w" sizes="(min-width: 30em) 50vw, 100vw"></picture></p><h3 id="technique-1" tabindex="-1"><a href="#technique-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Jump to heading</span>  </a>Technique</h3><p>The second technique uses a <mark>re-rendered/duplicate</mark> version of the original object/mesh to form the outline.

Vertex position</h4><p>The <mark>first method</mark> to enlarge the mesh is to simply scale it up. This is done by moving each vertex position along the vertex position. This may sound weird but the vertex position in local space, can be seen as a vector between the center of the object and the vertex position itself and so we can move the original vertex position along that vector. For the distance, we use a width parameter.</p><pre><code><span>// Move vertex along vertex position in object space.</span>

However, for other objects, these distances may vary and so vertices that are distanced further away from the center of the object, will get moved more. To fix this, you can normalize the vector along which the movement occurs.</p><pre><code><span>// Move vertex along normalized vertex position in object space.</span>
positionOS <span>+=</span> <span>normalize</span><span>(</span>positionOS<span>)</span> <span>*</span> width<span>;</span></code></pre><p>The result is that now all the vertices get moved an equal distance in object space, usually resulting in an outline that looks more equal-width.</p><p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://ameye.dev/notes/rendering-outlines/vertex-extrusion/object-space-normalized-vertex-position.png-400w.webp 400w, https://ameye.dev/notes/rendering-outlines/vertex-extrusion/object-space-normalized-vertex-position.png-800w.webp 800w, https://ameye.dev/notes/rendering-outlines/vertex-extrusion/object-space-normalized-vertex-position.png-1200w.webp 1200w, https://ameye.dev/notes/rendering-outlines/vertex-extrusion/object-space-normalized-vertex-position.png-1909w.webp 1909w" sizes="(min-width: 30em) 50vw, 100vw"><img alt="Move along normalized vertex position in object space." loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://ameye.dev/notes/rendering-outlines/vertex-extrusion/object-space-normalized-vertex-position.png-400w.jpeg" width="1909" height="860" srcset="https://ameye.dev/notes/rendering-outlines/vertex-extrusion/object-space-normalized-vertex-position.png-400w.jpeg 400w, https://ameye.dev/notes/rendering-outlines/vertex-extrusion/object-space-normalized-vertex-position.png-800w.jpeg 800w, https://ameye.dev/notes/rendering-outlines/vertex-extrusion/object-space-normalized-vertex-position.png-1200w.jpeg 1200w, https://ameye.dev/notes/rendering-outlines/vertex-extrusion/object-space-normalized-vertex-position.png-1909w.jpeg 1909w" sizes="(min-width: 30em) 50vw, 100vw"></picture></p><p>However, due to working in object space, the outline still isn't a perfect equal-width outline.

positionOS <span>+=</span> normalOS <span>*</span> width<span>;</span></code></pre><p>The result is a pretty nice-looking outline for objects with smooth corners such as spheres and capsules.

Vertex color</h4><p>A <mark>third method</mark> is to move the vertices along their vertex color. The logic behind this is that you can generate custom normals and store those in the vertex color channels of the mesh. For example you could bake spherical (smooth) normals into vertex colors and use those for a cube mesh.</p><pre><code><span>// Move vertex along normal vector in object space.</span>
positionOS <span>+=</span> vertexColor <span>*</span> width<span>;</span></code></pre><p>You can see the the outline around the cube looks much better when using custom normals.</p><p>This method can avoid artifacts with models that have sharp edges but the big downside is the manual setup involved since you need to generate custom normals for your mesh, although this process can be automated using a script that bakes the normals.</p><h3 id="extrusion-space" tabindex="-1"><a href="#extrusion-space" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Jump to heading</span>  </a>Extrusion space</h3><p>Once we have decided the direction along which we want to move the vertices, we need to choose in which coordinate space this extrusion should happen. During the vertex stage of our shader, the coordinates of the vertices start out being defined in object space and end up being transformed to clip space. This is done by applying the <mark>MVP (model/view/projection) matrix</mark>. Throughout the whole rendering pipeline, the coordinates of the vertices go through these spaces.</p><blockquote><p><strong>1.</strong> 📦 object/model/local space</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>2.</strong> 🌍 world space</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>3.</strong> 📷 camera/eye/view space</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>4.</strong> ✂️ (homogeneous) clip space</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>5.</strong> 🖥️ screen space</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>6.</strong> 🖼️ viewport/window space</p></blockquote><p>The significance of these coordinate spaces for our outlines will be explained below.</p><h4>Object space</h4><p>The <mark>first method</mark> is to translate the vertices in object space.</p><pre><code><span>// Move vertex along vertex position in object space.</span>
IN<span>.</span>positionOS<span>.</span>xyz <span>+=</span> IN<span>.</span>positionOS<span>.</span>xyz <span>*</span> width<span>;</span></code></pre><p>There are 2 big issues with doing the outline in object space. This is because when working in object space, the MVP transformations are yet to be applied. These transformations will alter the shape of the outline, distorting it in the process. The issues are as follows:</p><ol><li><p><mark>Scaling</mark> of the outline</p><p>-&gt; when going from object space to world space (applying model matrix M)</p></li><li><p><mark>Foreshortening</mark></p><p>-&gt; due to the perspective divide happening when going from clip space to screen space</p></li></ol><p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://ameye.dev/notes/rendering-outlines/vertex-extrusion/foreshortening.png-400w.webp 400w, https://ameye.dev/notes/rendering-outlines/vertex-extrusion/foreshortening.png-800w.webp 800w, https://ameye.dev/notes/rendering-outlines/vertex-extrusion/foreshortening.png-871w.webp 871w" sizes="(min-width: 30em) 50vw, 100vw"><img alt="Blurred buffer outline." loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://ameye.dev/notes/rendering-outlines/vertex-extrusion/foreshortening.png-400w.jpeg" width="871" height="721" srcset="https://ameye.dev/notes/rendering-outlines/vertex-extrusion/foreshortening.png-400w.jpeg 400w, https://ameye.dev/notes/rendering-outlines/vertex-extrusion/foreshortening.png-800w.jpeg 800w, https://ameye.dev/notes/rendering-outlines/vertex-extrusion/foreshortening.png-871w.jpeg 871w" sizes="(min-width: 30em) 50vw, 100vw"></picture></p><p>Another consideration is that when translating the vertices in object space, this is done in a 3D space. This means that some translations will be done directly towards or away from the camera, not contributing to the apparent-width of the outline. Instead of using object-space units, it might be better to be able to control the outline width in terms of screen-space pixels.</p><h4>Clip space</h4><p>A <mark>second method</mark> is to perform the translations of the vertices in clip space.</p><pre><code><span>// Transform vertex from object space to clip space.</span>

As a second step, the vertex gets translated along its normal vector. Since we are working in a 2D space now, <mark>only the x and y</mark> coordinates of the vertex positions get altered. The offset gets divided by the width and height of the screen to account for the <mark>aspect ratio</mark> of the screen. Then, the offset gets multiplied by the w component of the clip space vertex position. This is done because in the next stage, the clip space coordinates will be converted to screen space coordinates with a so-called <mark>perspective divide</mark> which will divide the clip space x/y/z coordinates by the clip space w coordinate. Since we want to end up with the same outline after this transformation to screen space, we pre-multiply by this clip space w coordinate so that the perspective divide will have no net effect on the outline. Finally, the offset gets multiplied by our desired outline width and a factor 2 so that a width unit 1 will correspond with exactly 1 pixel on the screen.</p><p><em>Phew!</em></p><p>I recommend reading this post on <a href="https://www.videopoetics.com/tutorials/pixel-perfect-outline-shaders-unity/#working-in-clip-space" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">creating an outline in clip space</a>.

For this technique, the silhouette of an object gets rendered to a buffer.

Silhouette Buffer</h3><p>The first step of this technique is creating the silhouette buffer. For this, each object gets rendered to a texture using a shader that outputs a plain color.</p><p>You can use the color white for all silhouettes, allowing you to choose a single color for all outlines at the end by multiplying with the desired outline color. Alternatively, you can render each object silhouette with a specific color if you want each object to have a different colored outline.</p><h3 id="2.-blur-pass" tabindex="-1"><a href="#2.-blur-pass" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Jump to heading</span>  </a>2. Blur Pass</h3><p>The blur pass is used for expanding the silhouette buffer. This is usually done using a box blur or gaussian blur. To improve performance, the silhouette buffer can be <mark>scaled down</mark> before blurring. This is advantageous because blur passes can be expensive, having to process multiple pixels per pixel since they work by taking a (weighted) average of the pixels surrounding a given pixel.</p><p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://ameye.dev/notes/rendering-outlines/blurred-buffer/downscale.png-400w.webp 400w, https://ameye.dev/notes/rendering-outlines/blurred-buffer/downscale.png-800w.webp 800w, https://ameye.dev/notes/rendering-outlines/blurred-buffer/downscale.png-1200w.webp 1200w, https://ameye.dev/notes/rendering-outlines/blurred-buffer/downscale.png-1920w.webp 1920w" sizes="(min-width: 30em) 50vw, 100vw"><img alt="Blurred buffer outline." loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://ameye.dev/notes/rendering-outlines/blurred-buffer/downscale.png-400w.jpeg" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://ameye.dev/notes/rendering-outlines/blurred-buffer/downscale.png-400w.jpeg 400w, https://ameye.dev/notes/rendering-outlines/blurred-buffer/downscale.png-800w.jpeg 800w, https://ameye.dev/notes/rendering-outlines/blurred-buffer/downscale.png-1200w.jpeg 1200w, https://ameye.dev/notes/rendering-outlines/blurred-buffer/downscale.png-1920w.jpeg 1920w" sizes="(min-width: 30em) 50vw, 100vw"></picture></p><p>Additionally, the blur pass should be done in <mark>2 passes</mark>.

The resulting edge that is drawn can be caused by any discontinuity that was found in one of the 3 buffers.

In the debug image above you can see that while some edges would be detected by all three discontinuity sources, a lot of them only get picked up from a contribution of a specific discontinuity source.

Some <mark>modulation</mark> has to be done to get rid of these artifacts. For example, since the depth buffer is <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/content/depth-precision-visualized" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">implemented non-linearly</a> in a lot of render pipelines, two objects 1m apart located close to the camera will have a larger depth difference than two objects 1m apart located far away from the camera. To accommodate for this, the threshold used for detecting discontinuities in depth can be modulated by the depth buffer itself so that geometry located close to the camera will need to have a larger discontinuity in depth value before being detected as an edge.</p><pre><code>depthThreshold <span>*=</span> _DepthDistanceModulation <span>*</span> <span>SampleSceneDepth</span><span>(</span>uv<span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre><p>A second common artifact is unwanted edges showing up on objects at small <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle_of_incidence_(optics)#Grazing_angle_or_glancing_angle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">grazing angles</a>.

  <div>
    <p>Together with some friends, I decided earlier this year to particpate in the <a href="https://www.carbagerun.nl/event/winter-editie-2025-naar-helsinki/">Carbage run 2025 Winter edition</a>. This is a 6-day journey in winter all the way through Sweden to the polar circle, and back down to Helsinki in a group of roughly 400 cars.</p>

<p>One small catch (you might have guessed it from the name): your car has to be “carbage”. In practice, this means it needs to be at least 20 years old, and with a day value of less than €1000.</p>

<p><img src="https://practicapp.com/images/carbagerun.jpg" width="350" height="350">
<img src="https://practicapp.com/images/carbagerun_route.jpg" width="350" height="350">
</p>

<p>This route, including the drive to get there and back from Belgium would mean driving roughly 6000km in just over a week, often in less-than-ideal conditions. In addition, our car will also be judged on originality, which is why this idea popped into my head:</p>

<p>
<img src="https://practicapp.com/images/joystick_steer.gif" width="350">
</p>

<p>
<i><b>Why not make it self-driving?</b></i>
</p>

<!--end_excerpt-->

<h2 id="what-how-is-this-even-possible">What?? How is this even possible?</h2>

<p>For those who don’t know: there is this project named <a href="https://github.com/commaai/openpilot">openpilot</a>, developed by <a href="https://comma.ai/">comma.ai</a> which adds L2 advanced driver assistance features (fancy words for partially self driving like Tesla’s Autopilot) to over 275+ supported car models such as <a href="https://comma.ai/vehicles">recent Toyotas, Hondas, Hyundais, VWs, …</a> Hell, there’s even support for Tesla’s Model 3/Y!</p>

<p>The key word here is “recent”, which is to say: the cars that are supportable need to have some electronic way of actuating steering, gas and brakes. This is the case in pretty much all modern cars, since stock ADAS features such as lane keeping assists and adaptive cruise control are more and more prevalent.</p>

<p>In these cases, the actuators are usually implemented in the form of Electric Power Steering (EPS), electric brake boosters / ABS pumps and electronic engine control units. These then accept (reasonable) actuation commands over CAN-bus messages from a camera module or similar, which then can be intercepted and replaced by more appropriate commands for openpilot.</p>

<p>Coincidentally, I’ve been working at comma.ai for about 5 years as a hardware engineer, so I am quite familiar with the inner workings of the whole system. A few years ago, I even gave <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8CxUSfipM">a talk about controlling cars</a> that goes a bit more in depth.</p>

<p><i>(by the way: <a href="https://comma.ai/jobs">we're hiring!)</a></i></p>

<h2 id="back-to-1993">Back to 1993</h2>

<p>
<img src="https://practicapp.com/images/volvo.jpg" width="700">
</p>

<p>This is the car we bought, sight-unseen at an online auction: a 1993 Volvo 940 Estate. While the state of the paint wouldn’t suggest it, it was actually in surprisingly good condition for a car over 30 years old.</p>

<p>As you can imagine, there are very little electronics in this car: the steering is hydraulic, the accelerator is driven by a cable between the gas pedal and the carburator, and the brake booster is vacuum-based.</p>

<p>Let’s go over these one by one and explain on how we can retrofit the needed actuators:</p>

<h2 id="steering-motor-and-sensor">Steering motor and sensor</h2>
<p>Probably the most important actuator needed for staying on the right track (and the one that turned out to be the most complex to adapt mechanically) is for the steering assist. As mentioned, the Volvo is fitted from the factory with a <a href="https://dsauto.com.my/en/2018/11/27/hydraulic-power-steering-explained/">hydraulically powered assist on the steering rack</a>.</p>

<p>To be able to put torque on the wheel electronically, the most feasible option we found is to retrofit an electric power steering actuator / ECU from a 2020 Toyota Corolla. In the Corolla, this motor is mounted on the steering column behind the dashboard, and amplifies the measured driver torque to the output shaft.</p>

<p>
<img src="https://practicapp.com/images/corolla-rack.jpg" width="700">
<i>The 2020 Corolla steering rack we got from a junkyard</i>
</p>

<p>While the full rack looks quite big, most of it is related to the steering wheel adjustment features, which can be removed for our use-case. To fit it behind the dash, we took out the original straight-axle steering column from the Volvo and fit the EPS inbetween:</p>

<p>
<img src="https://practicapp.com/images/cutting-eps.jpg" width="350">
<img src="https://practicapp.com/images/welding-eps-splines.jpg" width="350">
<i>We cut off as much as we could from the Corolla rack and welded the interfacing splines to the top of the original Volvo column (which we also cut in pieces)</i>
</p>

<p>With the motor now on the column, we added some extra bracing from the original steering frame to the EPS:</p>

<p>
<img src="https://practicapp.com/images/eps-in-frame.jpg" width="700">
</p>

<p>Except for the motor itself, the Corolla also has an exernal steering angle sensor. While the EPS motor has one built-in, it is only used for precise relative angles needed for the inner control loops. The external angle sensor provides it with an absolute angle measurement (zero degrees while the car is moving in a straight line), which is also needed for openpilot’s car controller code.</p>

<p>
<img src="https://practicapp.com/images/machining-angle-sensor-bushing.jpg" width="350">
<img src="https://practicapp.com/images/angle-sensor-installed.jpg" width="350">
<i>Machining a bushing to connect the angle sensor to the steering column shaft, and the sensor installed.</i>
</p>

<p>With both the motor and angle sensors installed in the steering subframe, it can be mounted in the car again. To our surprise, there was enough space under the dash to accomodate all this extra hardware, and no further modifications were necessary to get the dash back in!</p>

<p>
<img src="https://practicapp.com/images/installed-in-car.jpg" width="700">
</p>

<p>I’ll dive into the wiring a bit more in an upcoming blog post, but in summary: hooking up the motor and angle sensor electrically is very straight-forward. Since you can download the schematics and connector references from Toyota for a small fee, it was easy to figure out that the steering rack only needs GND, constant 12V (fused at 80A!), a 12V “ignition” signal and CAN to the angle sensor.</p>

<p>With just that, the EPS springs to life (likely in limp-mode since it’s missing some Toyota-messages it expects with the current car speed, …) and happily works as if it was in its original car.</p>

<h3 id="what-about-the-original-hydraulic-steering-assist-dont-you-have-two-systems-now">What about the original hydraulic steering assist? Don’t you have two systems now?</h3>
<p>Good observation. In short: yes.</p>

<p>While you could just disable the hydraulic power assist and just rely on the new electric one, I fear that the steering rack might not be designed to handle the higher amounts of torque it would constantly receive from the EPS during normal driving and might potentially wear out over time.</p>

<p>The steering works just fine with both systems active (it made the steering nice and light too!), but it’s not ideal. One downside of having both assists active is that the car doesn’t have enough self-centering torque to backdrive both systems and center the steering wheel when you let go of the wheel in a curve; It just stays where you put it.</p>

<p>There might be multiple ways to resolve this, although I have not tried yet. For example, it might be possible to reduce the hydraulic pressure in the system, rendering the original assist less powerful.</p>

<h2 id="brake-booster">Brake booster</h2>

<p>Probably the most effective feature modern cars offer for reducing driver load in long drives is adaptive cruise control. To be able to follow the car in front of you at a safe distance without manual interventions, the car needs to be able to brake automatically.</p>

<p>As you can guess by now: this is not something the 30-year-old Volvo was set up to do from the factory. Originally, the car’s brakes rely on a simple vacuum-assist system to amplify the pressure the driver puts on the brake pedal, which in turn pushes on the master cylinder.</p>

<p>
<img src="https://practicapp.com/images/vacuum-booster.jpg" width="700">
<i>Diagram of a vacuum-assisted braking system (Image source: <a href="https://help.summitracing.com/knowledgebase/article/SR-05293/en-us">Summit Racing</a>)</i>
</p>

<p>Luckily, modern cars still work in a very similar way. In fact, the system used by Tesla for example is based on the Bosch iBooster, which just replaces the vacuum-assist with a force sensor and an electric motor:</p>

<p>
<img src="https://practicapp.com/images/ibooster.png" width="700">
<i>Diagram of the Bosch iBooster (<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/The-mechanical-structure-and-working-principle-of-iBooster_fig4_324194807">Source</a>)</i>
</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it is well-known that these iBoosters are very useful for EV-conversion projects, since this is a way cleaner setup than having to replace the original engine’s vacuum source to get the original booster to work. It’s also widely known that these iBoosters go into limp mode without CAN connected, and thus can be used (without the controllable features) without having to do any complex work.</p>

<p>One of the companies that uses these iBoosters in their conversion projects is EVcreate, located in the Netherlands. They also published multiple awesone blog posts about using the iBoosters, like <a href="https://www.evcreate.com/wiring-the-ibooster/">this one where they show you how to hook it up</a>.</p>

<p>Since their wide use, the iBoosters are quite expensive on the second-hand market (especially compared to the rest of the car!). Since this is the case, I made a deal with Lars from EVcreate where he very generously provided me with an iBooster in exchange for the research required to get them controllable over CAN, outside of their Tesla comfy-zone. Lars, if you’re reading this: thanks again!</p>



<p><i>Here comes the part that blew my mind:</i></p>

<p>After removing the vacuum booster from the Volvo, I fully expected to have to design and weld in an adapter plate to fit it in the car. This couldn’t have been less true! The bolt hole pattern and center alignment hole lined up perfectly, and even the push rod built into the iBooster was approximately the right length to connect back up to the pedal. I say approximately, since we did have to add some 2mm washers to the threaded studs of the iBooster to get the push rod to sit fully extended when the pedal isn’t pressed.</p>

<p>
<img src="https://practicapp.com/images/ibooster-installed.jpg" width="700">
<i>iBooster installed in the Volvo. Looks almost original!</i>
</p>

<p>The orignal brake lines weren’t in the right spot due to the master cylinder on the iBooster having the ports on a different side, but after running new copper brake lines to the small distribution-looking block underneath the cylinder, bleeding the brakes and hooking up power, the brakes work normally!</p>

<p>One minor complication with this retrofit is that the clutch was also operated hydraulically with brake fluid from the same reservoir, so we had to add an small extra tank (the iBooster master cylinder tank doesn’t have a port for this).</p>

<p>
<img src="https://practicapp.com/images/clutch-tank.jpg" width="700">
<i>Small tank with brake fluid for the clutch</i>
</p>

<h2 id="accelerator-servo">Accelerator servo</h2>

<p>Sometimes you also want to go <em>faster</em> instead of <em>slower</em>! Another thing that Volvo implemented purely mechanically.</p>

<p>
<img src="https://practicapp.com/images/bowden-accelerator.jpg" width="700">
<i>The accelerator pedal is connected to the carburator air valve by means of a bowden cable</i>
</p>

<p>This is the only major actuator that I couldn’t easily find a suitable modern automotive solution for. This is mainly because newer cars don’t have carburators anymore, but rather use direct injection and advanced engine control units. Luckily this is also the only actuator that doesn’t come with major safety implications, so let’s just hack something together with off-the-shelf hobby parts!</p>

<p>Standard cruise control logic dictates that the driver can override the applied accelerator position by just pressing harder on the accelerator pedal himself. This is easy enough to implement by just having two cables connected to the air valve pulley: the cable that pulls the furthest wins.</p>

<p>With this in mind, I bought a (surprisingly strong!) waterproof RC servo from AliExpress, and had my Dad machine a second pulley that mounts onto it. After that it was just a matter of cobbling together a mount for the servo, and adding some bronze guide bushings to constrain the loose cables, and we’re in business!</p>

<i>Vroom vroom!</i>
</p>

<h2 id="bonus-content">Bonus content!</h2>
<p>While this isn’t an actuator, we also fitted a Tesla Continental radar sensor behind the front grille. While vision-only ACC somewhat works in openpilot, being able to rely on a real radar still makes for a smoother and more consistent experience.</p>

<p>
<img src="https://practicapp.com/images/radar.jpg" width="700">
<i>Ping Ping!</i>
</p>

<h2 id="wow-what-an-amazing-blog-post-when-will-part-2-come-out">Wow what an amazing blog post!!! When will part 2 come out??</h2>
<p>Good question. I’m lazy, so it might take a while.
On the other hand, we’ll have tons of time in the car in a few weeks, so maybe then?</p>

<p>I think part 2 will be about the wiring and the custom ECU I designed to keep the actuators happy, and to implement things like the cruise control buttons, as well as reading out the speed, blinkers, …</p>

<p>After that, I’ll do part 3 explaining (and open sourcing) the code on the ECU and the openpilot port.</p>

<p>After that, who knows! What would you like me to talk about more?</p>

                  <p>I'm not an expert on China, but during ongoing work on global supply chain disruptions with my co-authors Rebecca Freeman and Angelos Theodorakopoulos, I've noticed a stark fact that I don’t think is as widely known as it should be. China is the now world’s sole manufacturing superpower.</p>

<p>This column uses the OECD’s recently released <a href="https://www.oecd.org/sti/ind/measuring-trade-in-value-added.htm">2023 update</a> of their invaluable TiVA database to show, in eight charts, how this came to be. I will skip the historical Chinese reform narrative as that has been well covered by real China experts (e.g. Wang 2023, World Bank 2013, Ranganathan 2023).</p>

<h2>The world’s big players in manufacturing</h2>

<p>The charts in Figure 1 show two views of global manufacturing shares in 2020 (the latest year in the database). The left panel displays world shares in terms of gross production; in the right panel, the same is shown in terms of value added. The distinction is in intermediate inputs: Chinese gross production equals the total sales of Chinese manufacturers; Chinese value added is their gross production minus the purchased intermediates.</p>

<p>Six nations manufacture at least 3% of the world total. China is followed by the US, Japan, Germany, India, and South Korea. Note how the world has changed. Only three of these are long-established industrial economies; the other three are newly industrialised economies. Four of the G7 don’t make the cut. The chart separately identifies nations with shares of at least 2%, and on the left, this includes Italy, France, and Taiwan (two of the G7, the UK and Canada, don’t make the cut). In the right panel (value-added basis), the UK makes an appearance with a share just above 2%.</p>

<p>When it comes to gross production, China’s share is three times the US’ share, six times Japan’s, and nine times Germany’s. Taiwan, Mexico, Russia, and Brazil now have higher gross output than the UK. Canada is further down the ranking, in 15th place.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Unprecedented industrialisation</h2>

<p>China’s industrialisation is unprecedented. The last time the ‘king of the manufacturing hill’ got knocked off the throne was when the US surpassed the UK just before WW1. It took the US the better part of a century to rise to the top; the China-US switch took about 15 or 20 years. China’s industrialisation, in short, defies comparison.</p>

<p>Figure 2 portrays how China dethroned the king of the hill. If we think of this as a 25-lap horserace – one lap per year – all the excitement was in the first 13 laps. Since data only go back to 1995, China started the race a bit ahead of Canada, Britain, France, and Italy. China passed Germany in 1998, Japan in 2005, and the US in 2008. Since then, China has more than doubled its world share while the US’s share has fallen by another three percentage points. If this were a live horserace, boredom would have driven most of the audience away years ago.</p>

<p>The right panel shows that China’s share now exceeds that of the next largest manufacturers combined. This remarkable fact helps us to understand current US-China trade tensions, and the magnitude of supply chain disruptions that occurred when China dialled down its production during Covid. India (not shown separately) was the second fastest share gainer: its global share of manufacturing production rose by two percentage points since 1995.</p>

<p>China’s rise has slowed and looks to have stagnated at about a third of world output. To confirm this, however, we will need more recent data since the last two years in the sample are muddled by events related to the Covid-19 pandemic. The World Bank’s World Development Indicators (WDI) has data to 2022 for value added, and these conform to the flattening narrative, but the WDI do not report gross production data.</p>

<p>China’s dominance is less stark in exports (Figure 3), though the rise is equally amazing. In 1995 China had just 3% of world manufacturing exports, By 2020, its share had risen to 20%. The corresponding fall in the G7 share was less dramatic than for its share of production. This is explained by the meteoric rise in Chinese domestic consumption, which has absorbed an increasing share of its manufacturing production since 2004. Not shown in the charts is that China’s export to production ratio, having peaked at 18% in 2004, is 13% in 2020 – almost back to its 1995 level of 11%. The same diagrams in the Annex are shown for a value-added basis.</p>

<h2>Asymmetric supply chain exposure: G7 and China</h2>

<p>The global supply chain indicators that Rebecca Freeman, Angelos Theodorakopoulos and I developed last year (Baldwin et al. 2022) provide a convenient way of identifying foreign production exposure in supply chains (eight of our new indicators can be found in the TiVA 2023 update). Two of our new indicators are particularly intuitive when it comes to portraying global supply chain exposure.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Foreign Production Exposure: iMport side (FPEM). </strong>This shows the share of all industrial inputs (including domestically sourced inputs) that one nation sources from another on a scale of 0 to 100. FPEM accounts for exposure on a look-through basis in the sense that it looks through the suppliers-to-suppliers veil to discover the purchasing nation’s reliance on production in the selling nation.</li>
</ul><p>Figure 4, left panel, shows that the US relies far more on Chinese manufacturing production than vice versa.<sup>
  <a id="footnoteref2_fk48lrp" title="Scroll down to this footnote" href="#footnote2_fk48lrp" aria-describedby="footnoteref2_fk48lrp">2</a>
</sup>
 While shocking at first sight, this should not be unexpected. It is natural that a country with 11% of the world output buys more from a country that produces 35% than vice versa, but the numbers are astounding. China was more exposed to US inputs before 2002, but the US has had greater exposure since then. In 2020, the US was about three times more exposed to Chinese manufacturing production than vice versa.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Foreign Production Exposure: eXport side (FPEX)</strong>. This indicator reflects the share of a nation’s gross output of intermediate goods that is exported to a particular partner. It is a measure of exposure on the sales side.</li>
</ul><p>Figure 4, right panel, shows the expected result: China is and always has been more reliant on sales to the US than the other way round. In the mid-2000s, China’s dependence on the US was ten times the reverse dependence, but the asymmetry has narrowed substantially.</p>

<p>Putting together the pieces, this shows a remarkable, historical, world-shaping asymmetry in supply chain reliance between China and other major manufacturing countries. Politicians may wish to decouple their economies from China. These data suggest that decoupling would be difficult, slow, expensive, and disruptive – especially to G7 manufacturers. For explicit estimates, see the simulation studies by Felbermayr et al. (2023) and Goes and Bekkers (2022).</p>

<p>Before closing this chapter on the China rise story, it is important to say that the massive asymmetry has nothing really to do with China. It has to do with China’s superpower standing in manufacturing. To see this, imagine what the charts would look like if they displayed the facts for OPEC and the G7 in the petroleum sector. We would see that the G7 is massively more dependent on OPEC supplies than vice versa. The next chapter of the story redirects the spotlight to the China level.</p>

<h2>China’s balance of trade by sector, supply chain engagement, and openness</h2>

<p>What does the rise to superpower status look like from the shores of China? One convenient, if simplistic, yardstick of a country’s competitive profile is its balance of trade by sector.</p>

<p>The left panel of Figure 5 shows the balance of exports less imports in the major sectors: manufactures, agriculture, mining, and services. The overall trade balance, which is just the sum of the sectoral balances, is shown with the thin black line.&nbsp; The pattern is as clear as it is unsurprising. China is a net exporter of manufactured goods and a net importer of everything else – agriculture goods, mining goods and fuels, and services. Both the positive and negative net balances have been growing quickly. Plainly, China is a big importer and a big exporter. Overall, it ran surpluses in the late 2000s, which then decreased and turned negative in 2018 and 2019 (black line).</p>

<p>The right panel provides important hints about the evolution of China’s manufacturing. It charts the evolution of the country’s net exports of intermediate inputs and final goods. Until the mid-2000s, China was a typical offshore destination: a net importer of intermediate inputs and a net exporter of final goods that embodied the imported inputs. From about 2002, China became a large net exporter of intermediate goods as well as final goods.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 5</strong> Net exports by sector, China, 1995 to 2020</p>

  


<h6><em>Source</em>: OECD TiVA database.</h6>

<p>Aggregate balance-of-trade numbers like those in Figure 5 can hide the evolution of the constituent parts. Figure 6, which focuses on manufactured goods, shows exports and imports separately. In the left panel, we can observe that China’s engagement with global supply chains was extremely vigorous until the mid-2000s. Imports and exports of industrial parts and components were growing rapidly, and imports and exports were growing in tandem. Afterward that, exports grew faster, and this difference has produced the positive balance in manufactured goods..</p>

<p>The right panel shows a different picture for final manufactured goods. Here, exports have always exceeded imports, with the imbalance growing rapidly in the 2010s.</p>

<p>The next pair of charts shows the change in the sectoral composition of China’s exports.</p>

<p>Figure 7 presents the sectoral shares for 1995 (first year in the database) and 2020. It shows that China has moved from being relatively reliant on simple manufacturing sectors like textiles and clothing to more sophisticated sectors like electronics, basic and fabricated metal products, and chemicals and pharmaceuticals. A telling factoid is that textiles accounted for the biggest share in 1995, but electronics did so in 2020.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 7 </strong>China’s export basket, 1995 versus 2020</p>

  


<h6><em>Source</em>: OECD TiVA database.</h6>

<h2>Globalisation ratio</h2>

<p>Finally, consider China’s globalisation ratios (Figure 8). The right panel exhibits the country’s gross globalisation ratio (GGR) in manufacturing. This is the share of manufactured production that is sold abroad, where production is measured as the total sales of all China-based manufacturers. It differs from manufacturing GDP since it includes all sales, not just final good sales.</p>

<p>Turning to the facts, we see that during its rise to manufacturing superpower status, China’s GGR rocketed up – almost doubling – in the first decade of the data. Indeed, most of the action came between 1999 and 2004. That period was an extraordinary feat of globalisation, and it is probably why so many think of China as an economy that is incredibly dependent on exports. But the story doesn’t end in 2004.</p>

<p>Since 2004, China’s GGR has been falling steadily. And don’t miss the fact that it is, in 2020, not far above where it started in 1995. Chinese manufacturing, in short, is no longer as dependent on exports as many might believe. True, the first part of the rapid growth period involved exports growing faster than production (so the GGR rises). But then production grows faster than exports, implying that domestic sales were becoming relatively more important, compared to export sales – even though domestic and foreign sales were both booming throughout the high-growth episode. This dispels the myth that China’s success can be entirely attributed to exports. From around 2004, China increasingly became its own best customer.</p>

<p>The takeaway is simple: China’s openness, as measured by the GGR, has fallen rapidly. By 2020 it was only slightly more dependent on export sales than it was 1995.</p>

<h2>Concluding remarks</h2>

<p>China is now the world’s sole manufacturing giant. As its recent success in electric vehicles demonstrates, its wide and deep industrial base can help it gain a competitive edge in virtually all sectors. The exceptions are the most advanced sectors, where the G7 countries still dominate.</p>

<p>Politicians who indulge in loose talk about decoupling from China need a clear-eyed look at the facts. As we have shown (Baldwin et al. 2023), all the major manufacturers in the world source at least 2% of all their industrial inputs from China. Decoupling would be difficult, to say the least.</p>

<p>Arrays are in every web developer’s toolbox, and there are a dozen ways to iterate over them. Choose wrong, though, and all of that processing time will happen synchronously in one long, blocking task. The thing is, the most natural ways <em>are</em> the wrong ways. A simple <code>for..of</code> loop that processes each array item is synchronous by default, while Array methods like <code>forEach</code> and <code>map</code> can ONLY run synchronously. You almost certainly have a loop like this waiting to be optimized right now.</p>
<p>What’s the problem with long tasks, anyway? Every long task is a liability for an unresponsive user experience. If the user interacts with the page at just the right (or wrong) time, the browser won’t be able to handle that interaction until the task completes, which contributes to its input delay and slow Interaction to Next Paint (INP) performance. You can think of them like potholes on a road, forcing drivers to dodge them or risk damaging their cars—an unpleasant experience either way. Likewise, long tasks create unresponsive UIs, which can frustrate users and impact business metrics. They’re especially problematic when they’re not just coinciding with a user interaction, but in response to one. It’s no longer a matter of poor timing, because <em>every</em> click necessarily becomes a slow click.</p>
<p>Synchronously processing large arrays is one of the easiest ways to introduce long tasks. Even if the unit of work performed on each item in the array is reasonably fast, that time scales up linearly with the number of items. For example, if a CPU can complete one unit of work in 0.25 ms, and there are 1,000 units, the total processing time will be 250 ms, creating a long task and exceeding the threshold for a fast and responsive interaction. The key to breaking up the long task is to use the repetition to your advantage: each iteration of the loop is an opportunity to interrupt the processing and update the UI as needed.</p>
<h2 id="optimizing_interaction_responsiveness">Optimizing interaction responsiveness</h2>
<p>Interrupting a task to allow the event loop to continue turning is known as yielding. There are a few ways to yield, with the classic approach being <code>setTimeout</code> with a delay of 0 ms, or the more modern alternative: <code>scheduler.yield</code>. It’s not currently supported in all browsers, so production-ready use cases will need a polyfill or fall back to <code>setTimeout</code>. In both cases, the trick to making the loop asynchronous is to use async/await. But there’s a catch.</p>
<p>If you’re using an Array method like <code>forEach</code> or <code>map</code>, you’ll quickly realize that this doesn’t work:</p>
<pre>function handleClick() {
  items.forEach(async (item) =&gt; {
    await scheduler.yield();
    process(item);
  });
}
</pre>
<p><img decoding="async" title="" src="https://calendar.perfplanet.com/images/2024/rick/image9.png" alt=""></p>
<p><code>forEach</code> doesn’t care if your callback function is asynchronous, it will plow through every item in the array without awaiting the yield. And it doesn’t matter which approach you use <code>scheduler.yield</code> or <code>setTimeout</code>. Apparently, this trips up a lot of developers, with <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/37576685/1022333">this StackOverflow question</a>&nbsp;having been viewed 2.4 million times since it was asked in 2016. The solution is in the top answer: switch to using a <code>for..of</code> loop instead.</p>
<pre>async function handleClick() {
  for (const item of items) {
    await scheduler.yield();
    process(item);
  }
}
</pre>
<p><img decoding="async" title="" src="https://calendar.perfplanet.com/images/2024/rick/image3.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Instead of a monolithic long task blocking the click handler, now we’ve spread the work out into smaller tasks, responding to the interaction instantly. Problem solved, right?</p>
<p>Before we get into the major problem with this approach, you might have noticed the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/49499491/1022333">third most upvoted answer</a>&nbsp;on that StackOverflow question, which recommends using the <code>reduce</code> method. In case you were tempted to cling to your functional programming tendencies and use <code>reduce</code> to break up the long task, think again.</p>
<pre>function handleClick() {
  items.reduce(async (promise, item) =&gt; {
    await promise;
    await scheduler.yield();
    process(item);
  }, Promise.resolve());
}
</pre>
<p><img decoding="async" title="" src="https://calendar.perfplanet.com/images/2024/rick/image4.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This approach passes a promise along from one iteration to the next, which we can await before processing the next item. However, the issue with this is that <code>reduce</code> still plows through the entire array, synchronously queuing up each microtask. It’s not until the promises are fulfilled that it starts processing the items. In other words, even though the actual processing happens asynchronously, the amount of overhead is still enough to make the click handler slow.</p>
<p>Yielding within a <code>for..of</code> loop seems like the best way to achieve responsive interactions, but the problem is that we’re yielding on EVERY iteration of the loop. Let’s see what happens in browsers that don’t support <code>scheduler.yield</code>:</p>
<pre>async function handleClick() {
  for (const item of items) {
    await Promise(resolve =&gt; setTimeout(resolve, 0));
    process(item);
  }
}
</pre>
<p><img decoding="async" title="" src="https://calendar.perfplanet.com/images/2024/rick/image1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>With <code>setTimeout</code>, the job takes over 2 minutes to complete! Compare that with <code>scheduler.yield</code>, which completes in about 1 second. The huge disparity comes down to the fact that these are <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/setTimeout#reasons_for_delays_longer_than_specified">nested timeouts</a>. Unlike tasks deferred with <code>scheduler.yield</code>, browsers introduce a 4 ms gap between nested timeouts. But that’s not to say that using <code>scheduler.yield</code> on every iteration comes without a cost. Both approaches introduce some overhead, which can be mitigated with batching.</p>
<h2 id="optimizing_total_processing_time">Optimizing total processing time</h2>
<p>Batching is processing multiple iterations of the loop before yielding. The interesting problem is knowing when to yield. Let’s say you yield after processing every 100 items in the array. Did you solve the long task problem? Well, that depends on the CPU speed and how much time the average item takes to process, and both of those factors will vary depending on the client’s machine.</p>
<p>Rather than batching by number of items, a much better approach would be to batch items by the time it takes to process them. That way you can set a reasonable batch duration, say 50 ms, and yield only when it’s been at least that long since the last yield.</p>
<pre>const BATCH_DURATION = 50;
let timeOfLastYield = performance.now();

function shouldYield() {
  const now = performance.now();
  if (now - timeOfLastYield &gt; BATCH_DURATION) {
    timeOfLastYield = now;
    return true;
  }
  return false;
}

async function handleClick() {
  for (const item of items) {
    if (shouldYield()) {
      await scheduler.yield();
    }
    process(item);
  }
}
</pre>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://calendar.perfplanet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image9-1024x288.png" alt="" width="1024" height="288" srcset="https://calendar.perfplanet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image9-1024x288.png 1024w, https://calendar.perfplanet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image9-300x84.png 300w, https://calendar.perfplanet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image9-768x216.png 768w, https://calendar.perfplanet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image9-1536x432.png 1536w, https://calendar.perfplanet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image9.png 1892w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></p>
<p>And here are the results with <code>setTimeout</code>:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="" src="https://calendar.perfplanet.com/images/2024/rick/image5.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The choice of batch duration is a tradeoff between minimizing the amount of time a user would spend waiting if they interacted with the page during the batch processing and the total time to process everything in the array. If you chunk up the work into 100 ms batches, that’s fewer interruptions and faster throughput, but at worst that’s also 100 ms of possible input delay, which is already half the budget for a fast interaction. On the other hand, with 10 ms batches, the worst case input delay is almost negligible, but more interruptions and slower throughput.</p>
<p>Your primary goal should be to unblock the interaction so that it feels responsive. That could just mean yielding so that you can update the UI with the first few items, or kicking off a loading animation. How often you yield during the rest of the processing time will depend on what your second priority is. Maybe nothing can be shown to the user until the entire array is processed, so your secondary goal should be to finish as quickly as possible. In that case you’ll want to go with a higher batch duration. Or maybe it’s ok to do the work in the background, but the UI should remain as smooth and responsive as possible. That lends itself to a smaller batch duration. When in doubt, 50 ms can be a good compromise, but it’s always a good idea to profile different approaches and pick what works best for your app.</p>
<p>We could stop there, but there’s one more thing that you might want to consider: frame rate. If you look closely at the screenshots above, you’ll notice thin green markers roughly corresponding to the paint cycle. These are custom timings using <code>performance.mark</code> to show when a <code>requestAnimationFrame</code> callback runs. There’s a curious difference in the frame rates of <code>scheduler.yield</code> and <code>setTimeout</code>.</p>
<h2 id="optimizing_smoothness">Optimizing smoothness</h2>
<p>To reiterate, if the work needs to be completed as quickly as possible, you should minimize the number of yields. But there are plenty of instances where it’s more important to provide visual feedback to the user that something is happening, like a progress indicator. Even if you’re not showing any progress to the user, you might still want to keep the frame rate reasonably fast to avoid janky animations or scrolling behavior. That’s where the preferential priority of <code>scheduler.yield</code> starts getting in the way.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="" src="https://calendar.perfplanet.com/images/2024/rick/image6.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Surprisingly, for batch durations under 100 ms, the frame rate is relatively flat around 10 FPS. However, <code>setTimeout</code> follows the expected curve, where more frames are painted as the batch duration decreases, approaching 60 FPS. Tasks scheduled with <code>scheduler.yield</code> are given preferential treatment, so even if you don’t do any batching at all, the browser will prioritize it over the next paint—but only up to a point.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="" src="https://calendar.perfplanet.com/images/2024/rick/image2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>With no batching, the average time between frames is 120 ms, far from the 16 ms you get with tasks scheduled with <code>setTimeout</code>. This means your frame rate will be a lame 8 FPS. If you’re cool with that, you can skip the rest of this section. But I know there are some people who can’t stand the thought of a laggy UI, so here are some tips.</p>
<pre>const BATCH_DURATION = 1000 / 30; // 30 FPS
let timeOfLastYield = performance.now();

function shouldYield() {
  const now = performance.now();
  if (now - timeOfLastYield &gt; BATCH_DURATION) {
    timeOfLastYield = now;
    return true;
  }
  return false;
}

async function handleClick() {
  for (const item of items) {
    if (shouldYield()) {
      await new Promise(requestAnimationFrame);
      await scheduler.yield();
    }
    process(item);
  }
}
</pre>
<p><img decoding="async" title="" src="https://calendar.perfplanet.com/images/2024/rick/image7.png" alt=""></p>
<p>First, change the batch duration to align with your desired frame rate. When it’s time to yield, before calling <code>scheduler.yield</code>, await a promise that resolves in a <code>requestAnimationFrame</code> callback. This effectively prevents any more work from happening until a frame is painted, ensuring a much smoother UI.</p>
<p>One gotcha is that the rAF callback won’t be fired as long as the tab is in the background. We can make a few adjustments to handle this edge case.</p>
<pre>const BATCH_DURATION = 1000 / 30; // 30 FPS
let timeOfLastYield = performance.now();

function shouldYield() {
  const now = performance.now();
  if (now - timeOfLastYield &gt; <span>(document.hidden ? </span><span>500</span><span> : BATCH_DURATION)</span>) {
    timeOfLastYield = now;
    return true;
  }
  return false;
}

async function handleClick() {
  for (const item of items) {
    if (shouldYield()) {
      if (document.hidden) {
        await new Promise(resolve =&gt; setTimeout(resolve, 1));
        timeOfLastYield = performance.now();
      } else {
        await Promise.race([
          new Promise(resolve =&gt; {
            timeoutId = setTimeout(() =&gt; {
              timeOfLastYield = performance.now();
              resolve();
            }, 100)
          }),
          new Promise(resolve =&gt; {
            requestAnimationFrame(() =&gt; {
              clearTimeout(timeoutId);
              resolve();
            });
          })
        ]);
        await scheduler.yield();
      }
    }
    process(item);
  }
}
</pre>

<p>The first change is to the <code>shouldYield</code> function, which now checks the page visibility. If the document is hidden, we can afford to yield in larger batches of 500 ms. Even though there is no user to experience a slow interaction, this still introduces a long task that could block the page from becoming visible if the user returns before the work is completed. <code>document.hidden</code> will continue to be true until the visibilitychange event can be handled, so we still need to yield periodically.</p>
<p>The second change is to the way we yield when the document is visible. We need to make sure that we’re not dependent on the rAF callback, so we can race it against a 100 ms timeout, borrowing from Vercel’s <a href="https://vercel.com/blog/demystifying-inp-new-tools-and-actionable-insights#the-implementation"><code>await-interaction-response</code></a> approach. The 100 ms timeout will be throttled to 1000 ms while the tab is backgrounded, but after that, the timeout will fire and work can resume. Resetting the <code>timeOfLastYield</code>&nbsp;is good so that the first backgrounded batch can run for the full 500 ms. And even though we’re racing the promises, the timeout’s callback will fire anyway, so it’s helpful to clear it during the rAF.</p>
<p>The final change is to the way we yield when the document is hidden. We want the visibilitychange event to fire, but <code>scheduler.yield</code> will always preempt it, delaying the page from becoming visible until the work is completed. That might be worth more investigation because it feels like a bug, but we can work around it by switching to a timeout-based approach. As long as the document is hidden, work will be done in 500 ms batches with an additional 500 ms delay between each batch, adding up to the 1000 ms delay for throttled timeouts. That way, if the user returns before the work is completed, the visibility state will be updated and the regular batching logic will kick back in.</p>
<p>If all of this feels overly complicated, that’s probably because it is. If your application can withstand pausing array iteration while the tab is in the background, then you should skip this last part for the sake of simplicity. In any case, this was a fun exercise in pushing the limits of yielding.</p>
<h2 id="try_it_out">Try it out</h2>
<p>If you’d like to try out the different yielding strategies, you can use <a href="https://loop-yields.glitch.me/">this demo</a>. That’s also what I used to make the screenshots in this post.</p>
<p>Hopefully this was a useful overview of the “yield in a loop” problem and how I’d go about solving it. Feel free to let me know if I got something wrong, or if you know of a better way I’d love to hear about it. Good luck out there!</p>

I have had editorial feedback and productive conversations—and some differences—about cartoons I have submitted for publication, but in all that time I’ve never had a cartoon killed because of who or what I chose to aim my pen at.  Until now.</span></p><p><span>The cartoon that was killed criticizes the billionaire tech and media chief executives who have been doing their best to curry favor with incoming President-elect Trump. There have been multiple </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/12/19/trump-bezos-musk-dinner/" rel="">articles</a><span> recently about these men with lucrative government contracts and an interest in eliminating regulations making their way to Mar-a-lago. The group in the cartoon included Mark Zuckerberg/Facebook &amp; Meta founder and CEO,  Sam Altman/AI CEO, Patrick Soon-Shiong/</span><em>LA Times </em><span>publisher, the Walt Disney Company/ABC News, and Jeff Bezos/</span><em>Washington Post</em><span> owner.  </span></p><p>While it isn’t uncommon for editorial page editors to object to visual metaphors within a cartoon if it strikes that editor as unclear or isn’t correctly conveying the message intended by the cartoonist, such editorial criticism was not the case regarding this cartoon. To be clear, there have been instances where sketches have been rejected or revisions requested,  but never because of the point of view inherent in the cartoon’s commentary.  That’s a game changer…and dangerous for a free press.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F185b68c6-9dba-4d15-9282-28cc9dc6aba8_1725x2100.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F185b68c6-9dba-4d15-9282-28cc9dc6aba8_1725x2100.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F185b68c6-9dba-4d15-9282-28cc9dc6aba8_1725x2100.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F185b68c6-9dba-4d15-9282-28cc9dc6aba8_1725x2100.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F185b68c6-9dba-4d15-9282-28cc9dc6aba8_1725x2100.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F185b68c6-9dba-4d15-9282-28cc9dc6aba8_1725x2100.jpeg" width="1456" height="1773" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/185b68c6-9dba-4d15-9282-28cc9dc6aba8_1725x2100.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1773,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:983666,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F185b68c6-9dba-4d15-9282-28cc9dc6aba8_1725x2100.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F185b68c6-9dba-4d15-9282-28cc9dc6aba8_1725x2100.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F185b68c6-9dba-4d15-9282-28cc9dc6aba8_1725x2100.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F185b68c6-9dba-4d15-9282-28cc9dc6aba8_1725x2100.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>(rough of cartoon killed)</p><p><span>Over the years I have watched my overseas colleagues risk their livelihoods and sometimes even their lives to expose injustices and hold their countries’ leaders accountable.

<p>The fields surrounding Byron Kominek’s farm lay fallow. But on a sunny morning in mid-December, Kominek harvests the sun’s rays.
</p>
<p>The idea to add solar panels to his family’s 24-acre farm emerged out of necessity.
</p>
<p>“Without much farming experience, it's hard to just jump into agriculture and expect to make a living on it. Solar was a way to have a long-term, steady income.” said Kominek, who moved to his grandfather’s farm in 2016 and now runs Jack’s Solar Garden — a nationally <a href="https://www.jackssolargarden.com/" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"><u>recognized site</u></a> for agrivoltaic research named in honor of his grandfather.
</p>
<p>Today, Kominek’s 3,276 solar panels generate enough electricity to power approximately 300 homes (the panels themselves take up just four acres of the property).
</p>
<p>This year delivered Denver’s second <a href="https://www.weather.gov/bou/DenverSummerHeat" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"><u>hottest summer on record</u></a>. As temperatures rise, agrivoltaics could provide a blueprint for how farmers can adapt.
</p>
<p>Beneath the solar panels, ducks, geese and sheep graze, and workers tend to a variety of crops, including salad greens, corn and radishes — all of which have flourished in the partial shade of his solar panels.
</p>
<p>As temperatures continue to rise, creating usable shade will become even more important.
</p>
<p>“Having shade on the ground is a climate adaptation. I hate to say it, but I've kind of given up on the thought that we're going to fix climate change whatsoever,” said Komenik. “Climate change is going to happen. It's going to be rapid. It's going to be terrible. So we need to figure out how to adapt to that changing climate.”
</p>
<p>Traditional solar arrays are built low to the ground. They may help to meet <a href="https://energyoffice.colorado.gov/climate-energy" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"><u>clean energy targets</u></a>, but they can have lasting negative impacts on the land, like soil compaction and habitat loss, and they often prohibit simultaneous uses of the land, such as growing food.
</p>
<p>By raising solar panels eight feet, Kominek argues that solar companies open a world of opportunities below.
</p>
<p>Growing crops or grazing animals in conjunction with solar can protect soil, provide landowners with an additional source of income and create valuable shade — which Kominek argues will become even more important to plants, animals and farm workers as temperatures rise.
</p>
<p>At 42, Kominek’s resume includes a smattering of experience — from long distance motorcycle trips through western Africa to work in the Foreign Service and multiple engineering degrees. But it wasn’t until a few years ago that he tried his hand at growing food.
</p>
<p>Kominek grew up in Johnson City, Tennessee, largely disconnected from agriculture. In the 1990s, he occasionally visited his family’s hay farm in Longmont, but by that time his grandfather had passed away and tenants farmed the fields.
</p>
<p>While working as a natural resource officer in Zambia and Mozambique, Kominek
</p>
<p>began to question the relationship many Americans had with the natural world.
</p>
<p>“We don't have to be extractive, it's just how we've chosen to do it,” he said.
</p>
<p>“Going to a different culture, different country, different context shows you that the same things that you do in your community can be achieved just by doing it differently.”

<p>Kominek moved to his family’s farm in 2016. Two years later, he took over the agricultural side of the property. From the start, he knew something needed to change.
</p>
<p>“Property taxes were going up, our utilities were going up, everything was going up,” said Kominek.
</p>
<p>Growing hay wasn’t going to cut it.
</p>
<p>“The idea for solar came about as a means to have a passive income that could help make ends meet here on the land,” said Kominek.
</p>
<p>Researchers at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and University of Arizona tipped him off to the emerging field of agrivoltaics — a portmanteau of agriculture and photovoltaics, which are more commonly known as solar panels.
</p>
<p>“I liked the idea of keeping the land active,” he said.
</p>
<p>Thanks to soaring property values in Boulder County, Kominek was able to put a lien on his farm to finance the construction of the solar panels. A series of lucky breaks followed: the farm sat across the street from a transmission line, the utility accepted his bid and the county changed its land use code to allow the project.
</p>
<p>Today, Kominek estimates that he earns $20,000 annually by selling energy to subscribers.

<p>Industry experts <a href="https://seia.org/state-solar-policy/colorado-solar/" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"><u>value</u></a> Colorado’s solar market at $8.1 billion. In 2023 alone, investors poured $2.3 billion into solar. Unfortunately, Kominek argues that the current evaluation system for large-scale solar projects could cost communities in the long run.
</p>
<p>“Oftentimes how [communities] evaluate bids from solar companies has nothing to do with land stewardship, has nothing to do with the agricultural activities or what goes on there. It really focuses on the price per kilowatt hour and whether they've done a project before or not,” said Kominek.
</p>
<p>Without further regard for land stewardship, large-scale projects can quickly turn into “a race to the bottom,” he said.
</p>
<p>“Does the community want the cheapest power possible at the expense of our lands? That’s a big question,” said Kominek.
</p>
<p>In order to make way for solar arrays, utility companies typically grade the land, which compacts soil.
</p>
<p>“Compaction is the enemy of all vegetation,” said Komenik.
</p>
<p>Once land is compacted, it can be difficult to revive since tilling can further degrade the soil and its ability to retain water.

<p>Perhaps a bigger problem, however, is that the status quo doesn’t incentivize agrivoltaics.
</p>
<p>According to Komenik, rules for solar development vary widely county by county. Even communities that welcome solar projects often don’t request stipulations for agriculture.
</p>
<p>According to Komenik, utility companies fear animals could damage solar arrays and that vegetation could interfere with energy capture.
</p>
<p>“The solar industry sees all vegetation as the enemy. If it grows too tall, they think it will shade the panels,” he said.
</p>
<p>Since the panels need to be elevated, the costs of agrivoltaics are higher than traditional solar arrays. Komenik thinks the price is overblown.
</p>
<p>“A lot of the cost of the solar array is the people — installing the solar panels and all the wiring that goes into it. Inverters and the transformers and the switchgear. None of that changes,” he said.
</p>
<p>NREL <a href="https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy21osti/77811.pdf" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"><u>estimates</u></a> that agrivoltaic systems cost between $0.07 and $0.80 more per watt of direct current.
</p>
<p>Komenik understands that agrivoltaics’ long-term future is dependent on community buy-in. That’s why he dedicates a lot of his time to education.
</p>
<p>“We need more examples. If there's just one in the country, it's easy to dismiss, but when there's thousands of them, people are more able to go out, learn about it, and figure out how they can do it,” he said.
</p>
<p>In Delta County, construction is underway at the Garnet Mesa solar project, an 80 megawatt agrivoltaic project that will provide power to approximately 18,000 homes and forage to approximately 600 sheep. Once built, it will become the state’s largest irrigated agrivoltaic site.
</p>
<p>County Commissioner Wendell Koontz was skeptical when the project first came across his desk.
</p>
<p>After a lifetime working in the energy industry, Koontz saw the plan’s lack of provisions for reclamation and irrigation as red flags.
</p>
<p>“Solar developers need to be held to the same economic and environmental standards that we would hold oil and gas, coal, any other energy provider to,” said Koontz.
</p>
<p>Koontz and fellow county commissioners gave their approval once developers revised the plan to add irrigation, changes to fences and landscaping and bonding for site reclamation.
</p>
<p>Once “I put my name on the resolution approving this project I got a stake in the game. Now I don't want to see it fail,” he said.
</p>
<p>Although elevated panels may provide sufficient room for people and sheep, they complicate mechanized agriculture. Koontz worries that noxious weeds or pooling water could become a problem if the irrigated land isn’t properly managed.
</p>
<p>Among the people he represents in Delta County, Koontz said that many would prefer to keep irrigated lands separate and relegate solar to barren mineral lands.
</p>
<p>“The ag economy is what really drives Delta County. It's part of our heritage. It's part of our culture,” said Kootnz. “We’ve got to be very thoughtful about what we're doing here because this is about food and economies.”
</p>
<p>Koontz said he’s “cautiously optimistic,” about the future of agrivoltaics. But after seeing how difficult these projects are to complete, he’s highly skeptical of the state’s promise to have 100% renewable energy by 2040.

<p>During the growing season, Jack’s Solar Farm buzzes with activity. Workers from Sprout City Farms, a Denver nonprofit, cultivate vegetables to sell at local farmers markets and donate to food pantries. The rest of the space is divided among researchers from Colorado State University, the University of Arizona and NREL.
</p>
<p>Although Komenik said that certain squash and beets haven’t fared well in the partial shade of his solar panels, most species have thrived.
</p>
<p>“Colorado is not a light-limited state. We're a water limited state. A lot of the little seed packets that we get come from the East Coast, where they have cloud cover and rain and such. We don't have those things out here,” said Komenick.
</p>
<p>Solar panels that rotate throughout the day provide partial sunlight akin to a sky of rolling clouds.
</p>
<p>On the hottest days, Komenik estimates that the shade beneath his panels is 15 to 20 degrees cooler than areas in direct sun. Working in the shade isn’t just a boon to workers who tend the property’s vegetables, it also helps to save water.
</p>
<p>Despite the success of Komenik’s operation, he thinks that future agrivoltaic development can take many forms. His farm’s proximity to Longmont, high quality soil and small footprint favored market vegetables and small-scale grazing.
</p>
<p>In all likelihood, future solar projects are likely to unfold on grasslands, where developers can get the most bang for their buck.
</p>
<p>“The majority of large solar arrays are being built in communities that have less than a few thousand people anywhere near them and so you don't have as much labor as is required for this type of work,” said Komenik.
</p>
<p>In these areas, sheep and cattle grazing offer an additional way to use the land that is less labor intensive and a better fit for the environment.
</p>
<p>Regardless of location, the number one key to success is a willingness to adapt.
</p>
<p>“If you're expecting to do the exact same thing as you were before the solar panels, you're going to be in for a surprise,” said Komenik.
</p>
<p>“It is going to change. It doesn't mean that it will necessarily be worse. It will simply be different.”

            <span>Abstract:</span>OpenAI o1 represents a significant milestone in Artificial Inteiligence, which achieves expert-level performances on many challanging tasks that require strong reasoning <a href="http://ability.openai/" rel="external noopener nofollow">this http URL</a> has claimed that the main techinique behinds o1 is the reinforcement learining. Recent works use alternative approaches like knowledge distillation to imitate o1's reasoning style, but their effectiveness is limited by the capability ceiling of the teacher model. Therefore, this paper analyzes the roadmap to achieving o1 from the perspective of reinforcement learning, focusing on four key components: policy initialization, reward design, search, and learning. Policy initialization enables models to develop human-like reasoning behaviors, equipping them with the ability to effectively explore solution spaces for complex problems. Reward design provides dense and effective signals via reward shaping or reward modeling, which is the guidance for both search and learning. Search plays a crucial role in generating high-quality solutions during both training and testing phases, which can produce better solutions with more computation. Learning utilizes the data generated by search for improving policy, which can achieve the better performance with more parameters and more searched data. Existing open-source projects that attempt to reproduce o1 can be seem as a part or a variant of our roadmap. Collectively, these components underscore how learning and search drive o1's advancement, making meaningful contributions to the development of LLM.

<p dir="auto">We started looking into Android APK Signing Block oddities at the request of
F-Droid [1] on 2021-08-25; we opened F-Droid issue "APK Signing Block
considerations" [2] on 2022-10-19.  No action was taken as a result.</p>
<p dir="auto">We published the "Android APK Signing Block Payload PoC" [3] to the Reproducible
Builds mailing list [4] on 2023-01-31.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">But the Android APK Signature Scheme v2/v3 actually allows embedding arbitrary
data (or code) in the signing block, meaning that two APKs with the exact same
valid signature -- though not a bit-by-bit identical signing block -- can
behave differently.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Jason Donenfeld reported "Potential security hazard: <code>apk_signer_fingerprint()</code>
looks at certs in reverse order that Android checks them" [5] on 2023-05-05; no
action was taken to fix this bug.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">However, there's a discrepancy between how these certificates are extracted
and how Android actually implements signature checks. [...] Notice how [the
google flowchart [6]] checks v3, then v2, and then v1. Yet the [F-Droid] code
above looks at v1, then v2, and then v3, in reverse order. So v1 could have a
bogus signer that some versions of Android never even look at, yet fdroid
makes a security decision based on it. Yikes! Also, it's worth noting that
apk_signer_fingerprint() also does not bother validating that the signatures
are correct.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Andreas Itzchak Rehberg (IzzyOnDroid) reported about "BLOBs in APK signing
blocks" in "Ramping up security: additional APK checks are in place with the
IzzyOnDroid repo" [7] on 2024-03-25.  The accompanying German article
"Android-Apps auf dem Seziertisch: Eine vertiefte Betrachtung" [8] points out
that we noticed that <code>apksigner</code> and <code>androguard</code> handle duplicate signing
blocks rather differently: the former only sees the first, the latter only the
last, which allows all kinds of shenanigans.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Observations</h2><a id="user-content-observations" aria-label="Permalink: Observations" href="#observations"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">We observed that embedding a v1 (JAR) signature file in an APK with <code>minSdk &gt;= 24</code> will be ignored by Android/<code>apksigner</code>, which only checks v2/v3 in that
case.  However, since <code>fdroidserver</code> checks v1 first, regardless of <code>minSdk</code>,
and does not verify the signature, it will accept a "fake" certificate and see
an incorrect certificate fingerprint.</p>
<p dir="auto">We also realised that the above mentioned discrepancy between <code>apksigner</code> and
<code>androguard</code> (which <code>fdroidserver</code> uses to extract the v2/v3 certificates) can
be abused here as well.  Simply copying the v2/v3 signature from a different APK
and appending it to the APK Signing Block will not affect <code>apksigner</code>'s
verification, but <code>androguard</code>, and thus also <code>fdroidserver</code>, will see only the
second block.  Again, the signature is not verified, a "fake" certificate
accepted, and an incorrect fingerprint seen.</p>
<p dir="auto">As a result, it is trivial to bypass the <code>AllowedAPKSigningKeys</code> certificate
pinning, as we can make <code>fdroidserver</code> see whatever certificate we want instead
of the one Android/<code>apksigner</code> does.  Note that we don't need a valid signature
for the APK (we really only need a copy of the DER certificate, though having
another APK signed with the certificate we want to use makes things easy).</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Update (2024-04-14)</h3><a id="user-content-update-2024-04-14" aria-label="Permalink: Update (2024-04-14)" href="#update-2024-04-14"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Having been asked about multiple certificates in APK signatures [5], we realised
that, like v2/v3 signatures, v1 signatures can indeed also contain multiple
certificates (e.g. a certificate chain, though neither <code>jarsigner</code> nor
<code>apksigner</code> seem to enforce any relationships between certificates).  However,
unlike v2/v3 -- which guarantee that the certificate used for the signature is
always the first in the sequence -- v1 does not define an ordering: the
signature block file is a PKCS#7 DER-encoded ASN.1 data structure (per RFC 2315)
and uses a SET for the list of certificates.</p>
<p dir="auto">Android/<code>apksigner</code> will find and use the first certificate that matches the
relevant <code>SignerInfo</code>, ignoring any other certificates, but <code>fdroidserver</code>
always returns the first certificate it finds in the signature block file.  Thus
we can once again trick it into seeing any certificate we want -- as long as it
only checks the v1 certificate (e.g. when the <code>fdroidserver.patch</code> has not been
applied or the APK only has a v1 signature).</p>
<p dir="auto">NB: apps with <code>targetSdk &gt;= 30</code> are required to have a v2/v3 signature.</p>
<p dir="auto">NB: Android &lt; N will only check the first <code>SignerInfo</code>, later versions pick the
first one that verifies if there are multiple.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Update (2024-04-20)</h3><a id="user-content-update-2024-04-20" aria-label="Permalink: Update (2024-04-20)" href="#update-2024-04-20"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Despite repeated warnings [5] that using the last certificate instead of the
first one does not in any way fix the vulnerability described in the 2024-04-14
update (PoC #3), the proposed patches for <code>fdroidserver</code> [10] and <code>androguard</code>
[11] do exactly this.  With that patch, version A (which inserts the fake
certificate first) of the PoC now fails, but version B (which inserts it last)
now works.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Update (2024-12-30 #1)</h3><a id="user-content-update-2024-12-30-1" aria-label="Permalink: Update (2024-12-30 #1)" href="#update-2024-12-30-1"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Instead of adopting the fixes we proposed, F-Droid wrote and merged their own
patch [10], ignoring repeated warnings it had significant flaws (including an
incorrect implementation of v1 signature verification and making it impossible
to have APKs with rotated keys in a repository).  As a result it is possible to
construct a valid v1 signature that <code>fdroidserver</code> matches to the wrong
certificate.</p>
<p dir="auto">We do this by simply creating and prepending a second SignerInfo using our own
certificate, which has the same serial number and an almost identical issuer --
e.g. a common name with a space (0x20) replaced by a tab (0x09) or a DEL (0x7f)
appended -- to exploit an implementation that will match the SignerInfo against
the wrong certificate through incorrect canonicalisation.</p>
<p dir="auto">Luckily, the impact is lower than that of the other vulnerabilities as it does
require a valid signature from the certificate one wishes to spoof.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Update (2024-12-30 #2)</h3><a id="user-content-update-2024-12-30-2" aria-label="Permalink: Update (2024-12-30 #2)" href="#update-2024-12-30-2"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Unfortunately, we found another more severe vulnerability as well, caused by a
regex incorrectly handling newlines in filenames.  This allows another trivial
bypass of certificate pinning, as we can once again make <code>fdroidserver</code> see
whatever certificate we want instead of the one Android/<code>apksigner</code> does (as
long as we have a valid v1 signature for some other APK).</p>
<p dir="auto">The regex in question, <code>^META-INF/.*\.(DSA|EC|RSA)$</code>, is supposed to match all
filenames that start with <code>META-INF/</code> and end with <code>.DSA</code>, <code>.EC,</code> or <code>.RSA</code>.
Unfortunately, the <code>.*</code> does not match newlines, and the <code>$</code> matches not just
the end of the string but "the end of the string or just before the newline at
the end of the string".  As a result we can use a newline in the filename of the
real signature files (before the extension), which Android/<code>apksigner</code> see but
<code>fdroidserver</code> does not, and a newline after the <code>.RSA</code> extension for the
spoofed signature files, which <code>fdroidserver</code> will see but Android/<code>apksigner</code>
will not.</p>
<p dir="auto">NB: <code>androguard</code> seems to use a similarly incorrect regex.</p>
<p dir="auto">We can do almost the exact same thing with NUL bytes instead of newlines,
independently of the flawed regex, because Python's <code>ZipInfo.filename</code> is
sanitised by removing any NUL byte and everything after it.  This will have the
same result for <code>fdroidserver</code> and <code>apksigner</code> (which happily accepts NUL bytes
in filenames) as above, but luckily Android rejects APKs with NUL bytes in
filenames, and such an APK will thus fail to install.</p>
<p dir="auto">NB: in light of all of the above we reiterate that we strongly recommend using
the official <code>apksig</code> library (used by <code>apksigner</code>) to both verify APK
signatures and return the first signer's certificate to avoid these kind of
implementation mistakes and inconsistencies and thus further vulnerabilities.
Handling common cases correctly is fairly easy, but handling edge cases
correctly is hard; rolling your own implementation without the required
expertise and care to get it right is irresponsible.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">PoC</h2><a id="user-content-poc" aria-label="Permalink: PoC" href="#poc"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">NB: you currently need the <code>signing</code> branch of <code>apksigtool</code> [9].</p>
<p dir="auto">NB: the "fake" signer shown here is from the official F-Droid client (its APK
has a v1+v2+v3 signature), the one <code>apksigner</code> sees is randomly generated by
<code>make-key.sh</code>; the <code>app.apk</code> used for testing had <code>minSdk 26</code> and a v2 signature
only.  Using APKs with other signature scheme combinations is certainly
possible, but might require adjusting the PoC code accordingly.</p>

<p dir="auto">The <code>fdroidserver.patch</code> changes the order so it matches Android's v3 before v2
before v1, and monkey-patches <code>androguard</code> to see the first block instead of the

prevents the known bypasses described here.</p>

<p dir="auto">The <code>fdroidserver-multicert.patch</code> simply rejects any v1 signatures with
multiple certificates.  This may reject some valid APKs, but handling those
properly is nontrivial and there should be few APKs with multiple certificates
and no v2/v3 signatures in the wild (e.g. the IzzyOnDroid repository found none
in its catalog).  We recommend using the official <code>apksig</code> library (used by

<p dir="auto">The <code>fdroidserver-regex.patch</code> fixes the regex to correctly handle newlines.</p>
<p dir="auto">The <code>fdroidserver-null-v1.patch</code> (for <code>fdroidserver</code> before the changes we
recommended against) and <code>fdroidserver-null-v2.patch</code> (for current
<code>fdroidserver</code>) use <code>ZipInfo.orig_filename</code> to handle NUL bytes properly (and
avoid other potential issues).</p>

<p dir="auto">The <code>scan.py</code> script can check APKs for <em>possible</em> signature issues: it will
flag APKs that are not clearly signed with a single unambiguous certificate,
which <em>could</em> result in the kind of accidental misidentification of the signer
-- despite successful verification by <code>apksigner</code> -- that we've demonstrated
here.  Unfortunately, such misidentification can easily happen as even the
official documentation of the various signature schemes does not completely
cover how Android/<code>apksigner</code> handles such cases.</p>
<p dir="auto">NB: this will flag some valid APKs too, e.g. those with certificate chains,
those having used key rotation, or those with multiple signers; as the
IzzyOnDroid repository found none in its catalog, these cases luckily seem to be
relatively rare.</p>

<p dir="auto">Let us go back to the year 1992. The CPUs were 1000 times slower than today and the acceleration via a GPU was unknown or unaffordable. 3D games were calculated exclusively on the CPU and the rendering engine rendered filled polygons with a single color.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/s-macke/VoxelSpace/blob/master/images/gunship2000-1991.gif"><img src="https://github.com/s-macke/VoxelSpace/raw/master/images/gunship2000-1991.gif" alt="Game Gunship 2000 in 1991" data-animated-image=""></a>
<em>Game Gunship 2000 published by MicroProse in 1991</em></p>
<p dir="auto">It was during that year <a href="http://www.novalogic.com/" rel="nofollow">NovaLogic</a> published the game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comanche_(video_game_series)" rel="nofollow">Comanche</a>.</p>

<em>Game Comanche published by NovaLogic in 1992</em></p>
<p dir="auto">The graphics were breathtaking for the time being and in my opinion 3 years ahead of its time. You see many more details such as textures on mountains and valleys, and for the first time a neat shading and even shadows. Sure, it's pixelated, but all games in those years were pixelated.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Render algorithm</h2><a id="user-content-render-algorithm" aria-label="Permalink: Render algorithm" href="#render-algorithm"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comanche_(video_game_series)" rel="nofollow">Comanche</a> uses a technique called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voxel_Space" rel="nofollow">Voxel Space</a>, which is based on the same ideas like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_casting" rel="nofollow">ray casting</a>. Hence the Voxel Space engine is a 2.5D engine, it doesn't have all the levels of freedom that a regular 3D engine offers.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Height map and color map</h3><a id="user-content-height-map-and-color-map" aria-label="Permalink: Height map and color map" href="#height-map-and-color-map"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The easiest way to represent a terrain is through a height map and color map. For the game Comanche a 1024 * 1024 one byte height map and a 1024 * 1024 one byte color map is used which you can download on this site. These maps are periodic:</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/s-macke/VoxelSpace/blob/master/images/periodicmap.gif"><img src="https://github.com/s-macke/VoxelSpace/raw/master/images/periodicmap.gif" alt="periodic map" data-animated-image=""></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Such maps limit the terrain to "one height per position on the map" - Complex geometries such as buildings or trees are not possible to represent. However, a great advantage of the colormap is, that it already contains the shading and shadows. The Voxel Space engine just takes the color and doesn't have to compute illumination during the render process.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Basic algorithm</h3><a id="user-content-basic-algorithm" aria-label="Permalink: Basic algorithm" href="#basic-algorithm"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">For a 3D engine the rendering algorithm is amazingly simple. The Voxel Space engine rasters the height and color map and draws vertical lines. The following figure demonstrate this technique.</p>

<li>Instead of drawing from back to the front we can draw from front to back. The advantage is, the we don't have to draw lines to the bottom of the screen every time because of occlusion. However, to guarantee occlusion we need an additional y-buffer. For every column, the highest y position is stored. Because we are drawing from the front to back, the visible part of the next line can only be larger then the highest line previously drawn.</li>
<li>Level of Detail. Render more details in front but less details far away.</li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      
  

          <div>
      <p>Researchers from the <a href="https://www.hubrecht.eu/research-groups/bakkers-group/">Bakkers group</a> at the Hubrecht Institute have successfully repaired damaged mouse hearts using a protein from zebrafish. They discovered that the protein Hmga1 plays a key role in heart regeneration in zebrafish. In mice, this protein was able to restore the heart by activating dormant repair genes without causing side effects, such as heart enlargement. This study, supported by the Dutch Heart Foundation and Hartekind Foundation, marks an important step toward regenerative therapies to prevent heart failure. The findings were published in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44161-024-00588-9">Nature Cardiovascular Research</a> on January 2, 2025.</p>
    </div>
          <div>
        <p>After a heart attack, the human heart loses millions of muscle cells that cannot regrow. This often leads to heart failure, where the heart struggles to pump blood effectively. Unlike humans, zebrafish grow new heart muscle cells: they have a regenerative capacity. When a zebrafish heart is damaged, it can fully restore its function within 60 days. “We don’t understand why some species can regenerate their hearts after injury while others cannot”, explains Jeroen Bakkers, the study’s leader. “By studying zebrafish and comparing them to other species, we can uncover the mechanisms of heart regeneration. This could eventually lead to therapies to prevent heart failure in humans.”</p>
<h5><strong>A protein that repairs damage</strong></h5>
<p>The research team identified a protein that enables heart repair in zebrafish. “We compared the zebrafish heart to the mouse heart, which, like the human heart, cannot regenerate”, says Dennis de Bakker, the study’s first author. “We looked at the activity of genes in damaged and healthy parts of the heart”, he explains. “Our findings revealed that the gene for the Hmga1 protein is active during heart regeneration in zebrafish but not in mice. This showed us that Hmga1 plays a key role in heart repair.” Typically, the Hmga1 protein is important during embryonic development when cells need to grow a lot. However, in adult cells, the gene for this protein is turned off.</p>
<h5><strong>Clearing ‘roadblocks’</strong></h5>
<p>The researchers investigates how the Hmga1 protein works. “We discovered that Hmga1 removes molecular ‘roadblocks’ on chromatin”, explains Mara Bouwman, co-first author. Chromatin is the structure that packages DNA. When it is tightly packed, genes are inactive. When it unpacks, genes can become active again. “Hmga1 clears the way, so to say, allowing dormant genes to get back to work”, she adds.</p>

          <h5><strong>From fish to mammals</strong></h5>
<p>To test if the protein works similarly in mammals, the researchers applied it locally to damaged mouse hearts. “The results were remarkable: the Hmga1 protein stimulated heart muscle cells to divide and grow, significantly improving heart function”, says Bakkers. Surprisingly, cell division occurred only in the damaged area—precisely where repair was needed. “There were no adverse effects, such as excessive growth or an enlarged heart. We also didn’t see any cell division in healthy heart tissue”, Bouwman emphasizes. “This suggests that the damage itself sends a signal to activate the process.”</p>
<p>The team then compared the activity of the Hmga1 gene in zebrafish, mice, and humans. In human hearts, as in adult mice, the Hmga1 protein is not produced after a heart attack. However, the gene for Hmga1 is present in humans and active during embryonic development. “This provides a foundation for gene therapies that could unlock the heart’s regenerative potential in humans”, Bakkers explains.</p>

          <div>
        <h5><strong>What’s next?</strong></h5>
<p>These findings open doors for safe, targeted regenerative therapies, but there is still much work to do. “We need to refine and test the therapy further before it can be brought to the clinic”, says Bakkers. “The next step is to test whether the protein also works on human heart muscle cells in culture. We are collaborating with UMC Utrecht for this, and in 2025, the Summit program (DRIVE-RM) will begin to explore heart regeneration further.”</p>
<h5><strong>Heart for collaboration</strong></h5>
<p>This research brought together scientists from the Hubrecht Institute and beyond. It was conducted as part of the OUTREACH consortium and funded by the Dutch Heart Foundation and <a href="https://www.hartekind.nl/onderzoeken/outreach#regeneratie">Hartekind Foundation.</a> The OUTREACH consortium is a collaboration between research institutes and all academic hospitals involved in treating patients with congenital heart defects in the Netherlands. “Normally, our group only focusses on zebrafish”, says Bouwman. “But to understand how our findings could be applied to mammals, we collaborated with the Van Rooij group and Christoffels group (Amsterdam UMC), experts in mouse research. Thanks to the Single Cell Core at the Hubrecht Institute, we were able to study heart regeneration at a detailed level.”</p>
<p>“We’re very lucky that we were able to set up these collaborations”, Bouwman continues. “It allows us to translate discoveries from zebrafish to mice and, hopefully, eventually to humans. We are learning so much from the zebrafish and its remarkable ability to regenerate its heart.”</p>

	Sun pours through the lush foliage of a jungle, bleaching the pale limestone as a rotting man stands in the center of an otherwise empty arena, his yellow eyes leering from beneath a fringe of limp, blonde hair. Positioned around the edge are a hundred bodies, Orcs and Trolls and bipedal oxen shouting, demanding, the death of the dishonorable. Their voices swell into a cacophony of noise before one rings out above the rest, howling, “Kill the cheater and you’ll get 20 gold!” There is silence, and then another frenzy. As I watch, eyes fixed on the dim glow of a laptop screen, I think of the colosseum in Rome — sweat running down the muscled arms of battle-tested gladiators, the crowd cheering for blood.</p>

<p>
	To commemorate the 20th anniversary of <em>World of Warcraft, </em>Blizzard Entertainment created a set of new servers designed to draw in fans old and new. This included a “Classic” server, which recreates the look and mechanics of the game’s earliest days, and will eventually be updated to include its expansions, starting with 2007’s <em>The Burning Crusade</em> and 2008’s <em>Wrath of the Lich King</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	The other big addition is a “Hardcore” server. Unlike standard servers, if you die in Hardcore, that character is lost forever — including rare items and gold. Between these new high-stakes servers and 2024’s <em>The War Within</em> expansion, interest in the game had been renewed, driving creators back to the world of Azeroth to mine a deep well of fresh content. Since the bump in users, <em>World of Warcraft</em> has remained a hot category on platforms like <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/twitch/" id="auto-tag_twitch" data-tag="twitch">Twitch</a> and YouTube, with overall viewership reaching well above 50 thousand, even during usual off hours, and it seems like everyone wants a piece of the pie.</p>



<p>
	Swaths of streamers have decided to team up and create <a rel="noreferrer noopener" data-id="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/world-of-warcraft-undaunted-guild-accessibility-1235183220/" target="_blank" data-type="link" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/world-of-warcraft-undaunted-guild-accessibility-1235183220/">guilds, enclosed social networks</a> where players can ask for help or chat in semi-private spaces, for the sole purpose of jumping into the new Hardcore server. One such guild began early with the first wave of Hardcore servers: OnlyFangs — a group of some of the <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" data-id="https://win.gg/news/all-the-members-of-onlyfangs-the-twitch-wow-superguild/" target="_blank" data-type="link" href="https://win.gg/news/all-the-members-of-onlyfangs-the-twitch-wow-superguild/">most popular creators</a> on Twitch like <a rel="noreferrer noopener" data-id="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/twitch-gambling-ban-sliker-debt-rehab-1234596040/" target="_blank" data-type="link" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/twitch-gambling-ban-sliker-debt-rehab-1234596040/">Mizkif</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" data-id="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-lists/top-social-media-influencers-creators-2024-1235084589/" target="_blank" data-type="link" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-lists/top-social-media-influencers-creators-2024-1235084589/">Pokimane</a>, and the guild’s leader Sodapoppin, who is currently the world’s most popular <em>World of Warcraft </em>streamer.

<p>
	After amassing a huge following with their first big season of Hardcore mode streaming, OnlyFangs made some big changes, <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" data-id="https://gameland.gg/sodapoppin-reveals-full-list-of-streamers-kicked-from-onlyfangs/" target="_blank" data-type="link" href="https://gameland.gg/sodapoppin-reveals-full-list-of-streamers-kicked-from-onlyfangs/">even dropping famou</a><a href="https://gameland.gg/sodapoppin-reveals-full-list-of-streamers-kicked-from-onlyfangs/" data-type="link" data-id="https://gameland.gg/sodapoppin-reveals-full-list-of-streamers-kicked-from-onlyfangs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">s</a><a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" data-id="https://gameland.gg/sodapoppin-reveals-full-list-of-streamers-kicked-from-onlyfangs/" target="_blank" data-type="link" href="https://gameland.gg/sodapoppin-reveals-full-list-of-streamers-kicked-from-onlyfangs/"> names like Pokimane</a> for not being devoted to the leveling grind.

And there would be a lot more drama this time around as OnlyFangs would be diving headfirst into the world of roleplaying, demanding that everyone involved fully commit to the bit.

<p>
	What they didn’t know was their experiment in <em>World of Warcraft</em> roleplay would inadvertently create one of the best emergent dramas on the internet.</p>



	



<p>
	In November 2024, OnlyFangs began the long journey to Molten Core, a level 60 dungeon, for their second season on the side of the Horde — <em>World of Warcraft</em>’s seemingly nefarious, but far more narratively complex faction. Choosing a faction, be it Horde or Alliance, impacts what quests players can pick up, what major cities and outposts they will have access to, and the races and classes they can select when it comes time to create a character.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	Comprised of green Orcs, blue-hued and tusked Trolls, rotting Undead, and the bestial, horned Tauren, participating streamers were sorted into these four racial groups based on a personality test taken beforehand. This would also limit streamers on what classes they could play, as the options in Classic (also known as “vanilla”) <em>World of Warcraft </em>were not as expansive as they are now. But most importantly, once a streamer’s character died in game, that character would be gone forever, with the streamer forced to start from zero should they want to continue the challenge of making it to level 60 and completing Molten Core.</p>



<p>
	The nature of these specific servers means that there’s actually something to lose, that time and energy put into a character could be wasted with one bad encounter or another player fumbling with their button inputs or healing potions. This is one of the core components of what makes <em>World of Warcraft </em>Hardcore so compelling. It’s the risk factor that makes games <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-review-1235005986/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-review-1235005986/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">like <em>Dark Souls</em> </a>so exciting to play or watch.

<p>
	On top of an already rigid set of rules and the high stakes environment, each streamer is expected to role-play as the character they had created, similar to a session of <em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" data-id="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/critical-role-dungeons-and-dragons-interview-1235188141/" target="_blank" data-type="link" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/critical-role-dungeons-and-dragons-interview-1235188141/">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em>. Adhering to the lore of <em>World of Warcraft</em> and responding to situations the way their character might<em>. </em>Are they a hard-headed Orc that had a lust for battle? Or are they an Undead that wouldn’t hesitate letting another player die if it meant their own survival? These factors contribute to how players approach specific situations and weave into how they interact with their fellow guild members. It’s like a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" data-id="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/valkyrae-youtuber-gta-v-roleplay-interview-1235005962/" target="_blank" data-type="link" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/valkyrae-youtuber-gta-v-roleplay-interview-1235005962/"><em>Grand Theft Auto</em> role-playing server</a>, just with high fantasy races and the shadow of perma-death looming over every dungeon run.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	For the season, over 100 streamers, including members of OTK or other popular independent talents such as <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/piratesoftware" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.twitch.tv/piratesoftware" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PirateSoftware</a>, are placed into factions and must stay in-character to create a sense of emergent storytelling. Some Troll players thank their deities, the “Loa,” (the gods of the Troll faction) for good luck or even claim to feel the death of another player through the invisible gods. In reality, the divine voice they “hear” is actually just an in-game notification that another player had bitten the dust. On top of this, each faction is vying against one another every week for the top spot, with the loser facing some kind of punishment. This fosters rivalries among the individual factions, adding to the narrative that continues to unfold week after week.</p>



<p>
	During each session, it’s up to the streamers to keep up the performance and remain in-character. This self-imposed rule creates organic events, making the streams more engaging to watch as players chat about the current activity of the guild and the latest gossip. With the amount of participants in every time zone, dozens of individual narratives emerge, creating a mix of faction and interpersonal politics within the guild.</p>

<p>
	Other limitations are instated, such as the ability to trade materials and crafted items exclusively with one another. This had been an issue with OnlyFangs’ first attempt at Hardcore, with several members of OTK avoiding any direct repercussions for their reckless deaths as their followers floated them valuable items to gear up for follow-up runs after losing everything before.

	</p>




<p>
	Cooperation is essential to survive, as <em>World of Warcraft </em>in its earliest iterations relied on players to party up to complete quests and successfully run dungeons to obtain valuable gear. This allows for organic relationships between characters to form, and through the use of in-game proximity voice chat, which allows players to hear each other by getting physically close in virtual space, viewers become familiar with characters through the sound of their voice.</p>



<p>
	As the campaign evolves, each streamer’s specific schtick provides a different lens into the guild’s daily happenings. Watching PirateSoftware offers viewers a glimpse into the politicking and bickering over who would become the de facto Warchief for the Trolls. Dropping into <a rel="nofollow" data-id="https://www.twitch.tv/sequisha" data-type="link" href="https://www.twitch.tv/sequisha" target="_blank">Sequ</a><a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" data-id="https://www.twitch.tv/sequisha" target="_blank" data-type="link" href="https://www.twitch.tv/sequisha">i</a><a rel="nofollow" data-id="https://www.twitch.tv/sequisha" data-type="link" href="https://www.twitch.tv/sequisha" target="_blank">sha’</a>s stream gives a taste of the mundane, slice of life roleplaying the Undead faction engaged in. But this is <em>World of Warcraft</em>, and the world of Azeroth isn’t always kind of filled with the most charitable characters.</p>



	<h2 id="the-drama-begins">
		<strong>The drama begins</strong>	</h2>



<p>
	Early on, one event had already rocked the guild, as Sodapoppin announced that Sequisha had been caught cheating by breaking a cardinal rule. In order to create more inventory space for items he didn’t have room for, Sequisha abused the in-game auction house to store items. This was strictly prohibited, and due to the nature of his crime, he would be sentenced to trial by combat. The guild was abuzz with Trolls, Orcs, Tauren, and Undead sprinting to the Gurubashi arena to watch Sequisha fight for his life. If he could last a total of twenty minutes, killing anyone who entered the arena in honorable one-versus-one combat , he would be allowed to live. It seemed as though Sequisha would be given a second chance, that is, until he met defeat at the hands of another guild member, and all over the sum of 20 gold.</p>

<p>
	After Sequisha’s cheating, and the chaos that followed in his subsequent execution, the Undead mostly kept to their own. Because of how severe the punishment was, there was division within the guild and tense arguments that occurred on stream both in and out of character. But as the drama snowballed, streamers only leaned deeper into their characters. <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/esfandtv" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.twitch.tv/esfandtv" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Esfand</a> (co-founder of OTK, playing a Tauren) began donning a mask during streams to fully immerse viewers into the character he was playing: a giant bipedal cow. Others even put on accents; in the case of Hubert, the Queen’s English to denote that he is of “higher intellect” and more cultured than his Orc brethren.

	</p>




<p>
	Despite the absurdity of watching a streamer try to navigate through dungeons and forests with a cow’s head pulled over his face, it shows a level of dedication to roleplaying that makes the OnlyFangs universe so enthralling. Its constant chaos becomes addictive to watch, like high fantasy reality TV.</p>



<p>
	Although there weren’t any more executions, OTK’s <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/mizkif" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.twitch.tv/mizkif" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Mizkif </a>had been banished from his group and was temporarily left to fend for himself, leading to a near daily cycle of deaths and restarts. Hubert began gifting his fellow Orc with temporary intellect, which nearly caused an uprising amongst his clansmen.</p>



<p>
	However, as the event stretched on, streamers began to drop like flies. <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/larxa" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.twitch.tv/larxa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Larxa,</a> who had never played <em>World of Warcraft</em> before, was determined to become the first to reach level 60 without having any real experience with the game. While roaming through The Barrens, a vast field of grass littered with hostile creatures, she stumbled upon a patrol of centaurs, and run down and killed. Reaching the end would require perseverance and dedication — which she showed by jumping back into the saddle for a second attempt weeks later.</p>

<p>
	While some members of OnlyFangs have reached level 60 as of reporting, none have tackled Molten Core, and for good reason. PirateSoftware describes the gauntlet of <em>World of Warcraft</em> Hardcore as more or less a test of knowledge. Those familiar with the game will no doubt have the edge over others who have never experienced these dungeons as they existed in the early days of the game. OnlyFangs has had to wait until enough players hit level 60, armed with better equipment, before tackling the final challenge. Without proper education and preparation,&nbsp; the number of possible deaths that could occur might set the entire guild back another series of weeks, or even a month.</p>



<p>
	The harsh reality of their task has pushed more streamers to help each other, easing previous tensions as alchemists created potions as temporary salves for wounds sustained in dungeon expeditions, weavers made cloth armor for healers and valuable bags to store items. It’s now understood that if OnlyFangs wanted to reach the end, they’ll need to do it together.

	</p>




	<h2 id="why-you-should-be-watching">
		<strong>Why you should be watching</strong>	</h2>



<p>
	What has been most surprising is the insistence of specific streamers to continue the long and hard road to level 60. Since the beginning of the event, <em>World of Warcraft</em> has remained within the top five games watched on Twitch, even with the release of highly anticipated titles like <em><a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/path-of-exile-2-explained-1235195377/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/path-of-exile-2-explained-1235195377/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Path of Exile 2</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/marvel-rivals-review-1235200428/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/marvel-rivals-review-1235200428/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals</a></em>. While this doesn’t necessarily translate to the amount of players in the MMORPG, it’s been riveting to watch how a nearly two decade old game has been rejuvenated by a simple server launch. As online celebrity-filled guilds like OnlyFangs continue to stretch the storytelling potential of <em>World of Warcraft</em>’s toolkit, the emergent drama and likelihood of ridiculous moments has become a massive draw.</p>



<p>
	For fans of <em>World of Warcraft</em>, there’s a clear upside as the game’s renewed popularity ensures its ongoing survival. With current viewership on Twitch rivaling that of a big new release or a massive content update for the free-to-play flavor of the week, Blizzard are bound to be paying attention in ways that will reflect future content for the game. For streamers, it’s a boon, as the living world of online roleplay makes for easy hours filled with content for their followers. And even for the more casual, the silent observer who knows nothing about <em>World of Warcraft</em> or each content creator’s persona, the interpersonal drama is enough to keep them coming back for more.

</p>



<p>
	Throughout my time watching, I’ve lovingly called these streams “my soaps.” Like any good TV show or online trends, what OnlyFangs is doing comes with a dash of FOMO; you simply have to be there. The emergent roleplay aspects and big names may be replicated, but it won’t be the same. There’s a special kind of in-the-moment urgency that comes with seeing a livestream trend rise in real-time.</p>



<p>
	After all, it’s not every day you tune into Twitch for a public execution.</p>
