<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-headline="Robert Dennard, DRAM Pioneer, Dies at 91"><p><strong>Robert Dennard </strong></p><p>Inventor of Dynamic RAM </p><p>Fellow, 91; died 23 April</p><p>In 1967 <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/thanks-for-the-memories" target="_self">Dennard</a> invented what is known as DRAM—a type of random-access semiconductor memory that stores each bit of data in a memory cell consisting of a tiny capacitor and <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/transistor">transistor</a>. </p><p>Before his invention, RAM required bulky, power-hungry components that were expensive to produce. His breakthrough paved the way for inexpensive, high-density, and commercially available memory.</p><p>The computing pioneer received the 2009 <a href="https://corporate-awards.ieee.org/award/ieee-medal-of-honor/" target="_blank">IEEE Medal of Honor</a> for his innovation.</p><p>Dennard began his career as a staff engineer at <a href="https://www.ibm.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IBM</a>’s New York City research lab. He worked on new devices and circuits for logic and memory applications and developed advanced data communication techniques. </p><p>He was transferred in 1961 to IBM’s newly opened <a href="https://research.ibm.com/labs/watson/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Watson Research Center</a>, in Yorktown Heights, N.Y., where he worked on field-effect transistors and integrated circuits, using a six-transistor memory cell for each bit of data, the standard at the time. In 1968 Dennard successfully reduced a RAM cell to a small capacitor and a single field-effect transistor—the device that became known as DRAM. He was granted a <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US3387286A/en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">U.S. patent</a> for his invention in 1968. </p><p>By the early 1970s, DRAM was standard in virtually all computers. A decade later, the device powered the first PCs—including the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/ibm">IBM</a> 5150—allowing them to perform more complex operations.</p><p>After DRAM’s success, Dennard turned his attention to transistors. In 1972 he developed principles for scaling metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) devices, the main building block in low-power and high-performance very-large-scale integration (VLSI) chips. IEEE Fellow <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/special-reports/50-years-of-moores-law/" target="_self">Gordon Moore</a> had predicted that the number of transistors on a chip would double every two years, but Dennard proposed that as transistors got smaller, their power consumption would remain nearly constant. He published his theory, now known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennard_scaling" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dennard scaling</a>, with a set of supporting principles in the 1974 paper “<a href="http://stanford.edu/class/cs114/readings/dennard.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Design of Ion-Implanted MOSFETs With Very Small Physical Dimensions</a>.”</p><p>Dennard was named an <a href="https://www.ibm.com/ibm/ideasfromibm/us/ibm_fellows/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IBM Fellow</a> in 1979. For the next several decades at the company, he worked on metal-oxide-semiconductor technology, refining RAM and developing low-voltage, high-performance circuits. </p><p>During his career, he was honored with dozens of awards including the 2019 <a href="https://corporate-awards.ieee.org/award/ieee-robert-n-noyce-medal/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IEEE Robert N. Noyce Medal</a> and the 2001 <a href="https://corporate-awards.ieee.org/award/ieee-edison-medal/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IEEE Edison Medal</a>. In 1997 Dennard was inducted into the <a href="https://www.invent.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">National Inventors Hall of Fame</a>.</p><p>He received bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electrical engineering in 1954 and 1956 from <a href="https://www.smu.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Southern Methodist University</a>, in Dallas. Two years later he earned a Ph.D. in electrical engineering from the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now part of <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Carnegie Mellon</a>).</p><p><strong>Richard P.

<p><span>Oct. 3 (UPI) --</span> The U.S. Department of Energy Thursday announced a $1.5 billion transmission investment to improve electric grid reliability.</p>
<p>The Energy Department<a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/biden-harris-administration-invests-15-billion-bolster-nations-electricity-grid-and-0" target="_blank"> said the $1.5 billion</a> will fund four transmission projects "that will improve grid reliability and resilience, relieve costly transmission congestion, and open access to affordable energy to millions of Americans across the country."
</p>
<p>"The U.S. transmission network is the backbone of our nation's electricity system. Though our grid has served U.S. energy needs for more than a century, our country's needs are changing," said U.S. Deputy Secretary of Energy David Turk in a statement.</p>
<p>The projects will increase grid capacity and are funded by the Biden-Harris administration's Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.

<p>The projects will enable nearly 1,000 miles of new electric transmission development and 7,100 megawatts of new capacity in Louisiana, Maine, Mississippi, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas.</p>
<p>The department said the the projects will also create 9,000 good-paying jobs.</p>
<p>They include the Aroostook Renewable Project in Maine, the Cimarron Link in Oklahoma, Southern Spirit connecting the Texas grid for the first time to southeastern U.S. power markets and Southline in New Mexico.</p>
<p>The Energy Department's National Transmission Planning study released Thursday was meant to be a long-term planning tool.
</p>
<p>It found that a substantial expansion of the transmission system throughout the entire contiguous United States would deliver the biggest grid benefits. That could also save the national electric system between $270 billion to $490 billion through 2050.</p>
<p>"The NTP Study is designed to enhance and encourage interregional planning efforts," the DOE said in a statement. "It does not replace industry planning or identify a specific set of transmission lines that should be built. Rather, the NTP Study identifies potential opportunities for industry planners to consider projects that would benefit customers under a wide range of future scenarios."</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    

  
  
    <address>Sahil Lavingia</address>
    <p><time>September 30, 2024</time></p><p>At Gumroad, we recently embarked on a new project called <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://helper.ai/">Helper</a>. As the CEO, I was initially quite
optimistic about using <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://htmx.org/">htmx</a> for this project, even though some team members were less enthusiastic.</p>
<p>My optimism stemmed from previous experiences with React, which often felt like overkill for our needs. I thought htmx
could be a good solution to keep our front-end super light.</p>

</figure>
<p>In fact, I shared this sentiment with our team in Slack:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“https://htmx.org/ may be a way of adding simple interactions to start”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And initially, it seemed promising! As one of our engineers at Gumroad eloquently put it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“HTMX is (officially) a meme to make fun of how overly complicated the JS landscape has gotten - much like tailwind is
just a different syntax for inline CSS, HTMX is a different syntax for inline JS.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, unlike Tailwind, which has found its place in our toolkit, htmx didn’t scale for our purposes and didn’t lead
to the best user experience for our customers–at least for our use case.</p>
<p>Here’s why:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Intuition and Developer Experience</strong>: While it would have been possible to do the right thing in htmx, we found it
much more intuitive and fun to get everything working with Next.js. The development process felt natural with
Next.js, whereas with htmx, it often felt unnatural and forced. For example, when building complex forms with dynamic
validation and conditional fields, we found ourselves writing convoluted server-side logic to handle what would be
straightforward client-side operations in React.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>UX Limitations</strong>: htmx ended up pushing our app towards a Rails/CRUD approach, which led to a really poor (or at
least, boring and generic) user experience by default. We found ourselves constantly fighting against this tendency,
which was counterproductive. For instance, implementing a drag-and-drop interface for our workflow builder proved to
be a significant challenge with htmx, requiring workarounds that felt clunky compared to the smooth experience we
could achieve with React libraries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>AI and Tooling Support</strong>: It’s worth noting that AI tools are intimately familiar with Next.js and not so much with
htmx, due to the lack of open-source training data. This is similar to the issue Rails faces. While not a
dealbreaker, it did impact our development speed and the ease of finding solutions to problems. When we encountered
issues, the wealth of resources available for React/Next.js made troubleshooting much faster.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Scalability Concerns</strong>: As our project grew in complexity, we found htmx struggling to keep up with our needs. The
simplicity that initially attracted us began to feel limiting as we tried to implement more sophisticated
interactions and state management. For example, as we added features like real-time collaboration and complex data
visualization, managing state across multiple components became increasingly difficult with htmx’s server-centric
approach.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Community and Ecosystem</strong>: The React/Next.js ecosystem is vast and mature, offering solutions to almost any problem
we encountered. With htmx, we often found ourselves reinventing the wheel or compromising on functionality. This
became particularly evident when we needed to integrate third-party services and libraries, which often had React
bindings but no htmx equivalents.</p>
</li>
</ol>

</figure>
<p>Ultimately, we ended up moving to React/Next.js, which has been a really great fit for building the complex UX we’ve
been looking for. We’re happy with this decision–for now. It’s allowed us to move faster, create more engaging user
experiences, and leverage a wealth of existing tools and libraries.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>This experience has reinforced a valuable lesson: while it’s important to consider lightweight alternatives, it’s
equally crucial to choose technologies that can grow with your project and support your long-term vision. For Helper,
React and Next.js have proven to be that choice.</p>
<p>Since we’ve moved there, we’ve been able to seriously upgrade our app’s user experience for our core customers.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Drag-and-Drop Functionality</strong>: One of the key features of our workflow builder is the ability to reorder steps
through drag-and-drop. While it’s possible to implement drag-and-drop with htmx, we found that the available
solutions felt clunky and required significant custom JavaScript. In contrast, React ecosystem offers libraries like
react-beautiful-dnd that provide smooth, accessible drag-and-drop with minimal setup.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Complex State Management</strong>: Each workflow step has its own set of configurations and conditional logic. As users
edit these, we need to update the UI in real-time to reflect changes and their implications on other steps. With
htmx, this would require numerous server roundtrips or complex client-side state management that goes against htmx’s
server-centric philosophy. React’s state management solutions (like useState or more advanced options like Redux)
made this much more straightforward.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dynamic Form Generation</strong>: The configuration for each step type is different and can change based on user input.
Generating these dynamic forms and handling their state was more intuitive with React’s component model. With htmx,
we found ourselves writing more complex server-side logic to generate and validate these forms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Real-time Collaboration</strong>: While not visible in this screenshot, we implemented features allowing multiple users to
edit a workflow simultaneously. Implementing this with WebSockets and React was relatively straightforward, whereas
with htmx, it would have required more complex server-side logic and custom JavaScript to handle real-time updates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Performance Optimization</strong>: As workflows grew larger and more complex, we needed fine-grained control over
rendering optimizations. React’s virtual DOM and hooks like useMemo and useCallback allowed us to optimize
performance in ways that weren’t as readily available or intuitive with htmx.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It’s important to note that while these challenges aren’t insurmountable with htmx, we found that addressing them often
led us away from htmx’s strengths and towards solutions that felt more natural in a JavaScript-heavy environment. This
realization was a key factor in our decision to switch to React and Next.js.</p>
<p>We acknowledge that htmx may be a great fit for many projects, especially those with simpler interaction models or those
built on top of existing server-rendered applications. Our experience doesn’t invalidate the benefits others have found
in htmx. The key is understanding your project’s specific needs and choosing the tool that best aligns with those
requirements.</p>
<p>In our case, the complex, stateful nature of Helper’s interface made React and Next.js a better fit. However, we
continue to appreciate htmx’s approach and may consider it for future projects where its strengths align better with our
needs.</p>
<p>That said, we’re always open to reevaluating our tech stack as our needs evolve and new technologies emerge. Who knows
what the future might bring?</p>

  <p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>The scalability limitations of Transformers regarding sequence length have renewed interest in recurrent sequence models that are parallelizable during training. As a result, many novel recurrent architectures, such as S4, Mamba, and Aaren, have been proposed that achieve comparable performance. In this work, we revisit traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) from over a decade ago: LSTMs (1997) and GRUs (2014). While these models were slow due to requiring to backpropagate through time (BPTT), we show that by removing their hidden state dependencies from their input, forget, and update gates, LSTMs and GRUs no longer need to BPTT and can be efficiently trained in parallel. Building on this, we introduce minimal versions (minLSTMs and minGRUs) that (1) use significantly fewer parameters than their traditional counterparts and (2) are fully parallelizable during training (175x faster for a sequence of length 512). Lastly, we show that these stripped-down versions of decade-old RNNs match the empirical performance of recent sequence models.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                
                <p>It’s no secret that the bulk of <a href="https://www.midiaresearch.com/blog/in-game-cosmetics-remain-a-huge-opportunity-for-brands-across-music-tv-sports-and-fashion" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AAA games market revenues come from in-game purchases</a>, mostly&nbsp;from live-service games. </p>
<p>It’s also impossible to ignore that the live-service market is fiercely competitive. Thanks to the oversaturated attention economy, only so many consumer hours are available. </p>
<p>And live-service games suck up <i>so much</i> attention and engagement. There are still opportunities in the space, but breaking through is extremely challenging.</p>
<p>With every new live-service hit that does manage to carve a spot for itself, there is less space available for new entrants to cast their net. </p>
<p>AAA developers on console and PC are continuing to chase the live-service jackpot, but single player remains the favourite way to play for most (53%) gamers. </p>
<p>There is also less risk, as there are more openings on the calendar for single player to stand out versus live service’s always-on engagement vacuum.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.midiaresearch.com/reports/single-player-is-safer-and-has-more-opportunities-amid-live-service-challenges" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MIDiA's latest gaming report</a> looks at the growing viability of(re)allocating resources towards single-player games. </p>
<p>We zoom in on gameplay preferences by platform and age, motivators for trying new games, preferred game themes for puzzle, action-adventure, sports, shooter, and RPG fans, and offer data-backed strategic recommendations. </p>
<p>This article shines the spotlight on some high-level takeaways from the first section of the report. If you’re ready to dive deeper, <a href="https://www.midiaresearch.com/contact" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">let us know</a>.</p>
<p><b>Several single-player studios were pushed into making live-service games – the trend chasing did NOT pay off</b></p>
<p>Many AAA game makers have been chasing the live-service trend, looking to replicate the success of <i>Fortnite</i>, <i>League of Legends</i>, <i>Roblox</i>, and other success stories. </p>
<p>Even developers that rose to prominence thanks to single-player – with games that helped put their publishers on the map – were pushed to chase the live-service trend.&nbsp; </p>
<p>For many, it was a wild goose chase, and the list of failures is growing. SEGA cancelled Creative Assembly’s <i>Hyenas</i> and PlayStation did the same thing for Naughty Dog’s <i>The Last of Us Online</i> after years of development. </p>
<p>Other revered single-player names in the industry have tried their hand at live services – with dire results: Crystal Dynamics (<i>Marvel’s Avengers</i>), EA’s BioWare (<i>Anthem</i>), Platinum Games (<i>Babylon’s Fall</i>), and Microsoft’s Arkane (<i>Redfall</i>) – the list goes on. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This underlines an undeniable opportunity cost:</p>
<ul>
<li>These studios’ single-player offerings have respectively generated hundreds of millions in revenue</li>
<li>How much revenue and positive consumer sentiment was left on the table because these companies were pushed to make live-service games?</li>
<li>Aggravating things, the market is too delicate for most publishers to take huge risks in an oversaturated space</li>
</ul>
<p>Hitting a few singles and doubles beats trying to hit a home run and striking out.</p>
<p>The timing of live service’s oversaturation is not ideal. Publishers now need to cut costs to adapt to a challenging macroeconomic climate (and to course correct from overextending during the pandemic). </p>
<p><b>There's a way forward for these studios: returning to what has always worked, single-player games </b></p>
<p><a href="https://www.midiaresearch.com/blog/concord-postmortem-what-went-wrong-and-whats-next-for-playstations-live-service-strategy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">While new live-service games have floundered</a>, new single-player games have continued to smash records and generate hundreds of millions – or more.&nbsp; And it is not just juggernaut IP like <i>Zelda</i> and <i>Spider-Man</i> proving successful but also new franchises like&nbsp;<i>Elden Ring </i>(25 million copies sold) and <i>Black Myth Wukong&nbsp;</i>(20 million).</p>
<p>While live-service games and in-game purchases dominate spending and attention in the games market, over half of gamers prefer solo play:&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://www.midiaresearch.com/storage/uploads/paragraphs/dbdbaba91de72cd615d8be1a0119cfca" alt="dbdbaba91de72cd615d8be1a0119cfca"></p>
<p>There are some caveats to this opportunity and how best to seize it. Data from the above image, which you can dive deeper into via the <a href="https://www.midiaresearch.com/reports/single-player-is-safer-and-has-more-opportunities-amid-live-service-challenges" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full single-player opportunity report</a>, underlines a positive correlation between age and preferring single-player: </p>
<ul>
<li>Beyond younger generations’ higher emphasis on social play, life starts getting busier in the mid-20s</li>
<li>Life commitments make it trickier to play live-service games regularly, and co-ordinating sessions with friends becomes more challenging</li>
<li>To that end, the 25+ gamers are the lowest-hanging fruit to target with single-player games</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Looking for splits by platform, region, or another variable? </i><a href="mailto:rhys@midiaresearch.com?subject=Game%20type%20preferences%20by%20platform%20split"><i>Let us know</i></a><i> – we have the data! </i></p>
<p><b>The one-and-done nature of single-player gels better with the saturated attention economy</b></p>
<p>Younger players prefer PVP, which captures a large swathe of consumer attention and engagement and is enjoyed by all generations. Convincing players – and their friends – to leave for new titles is a huge barrier. </p>
<p>Live-service games are the <i>homes</i> of many highly engaged players. Getting them (and their friends) to relocate permanently to another live-service game is a big ask.</p>
<p>Yet, going 'on holiday’ to a single-player game is more viable. Releasing in quieter periods for the big live-service games, like towards the latter part of the live-service seasons, could be beneficial here. </p>
<p>It is also easier for busier 25+ gamers to dip into a single-player game – perhaps even on a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.midiaresearch.com/blog/steam-is-the-unlikely-winner-of-the-modern-console-wars-for-now" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">supporting device like the Steam Deck</a>&nbsp;or PlayStation Portal. </p>
<p><b>Single-player games are a safer bet for new games</b></p>
<p>Make no mistake: the costs to make AAA single-player, non-live service games have inflated to astronomic levels. Leaks from Insomniac showed that PlayStation’s AAA flagship games, like <i>Spider-Man 2, </i>have budgets in the hundreds of millions of dollars. But there is a growing <a href="https://www.midiaresearch.com/blog/gamers-arent-finishing-games-and-thats-a-problem" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">opportunity for AAA studios to make leaner single-player games</a>. </p>
<p>Despite the extra risk, live-service games can be even more expensive. After launch, they also need significant additional costs to run over time (and keep their players coming back to spend). <i>Genshin Impact</i>’s budget was $100 million, with another $200 million <i>per year</i> needed for live-ops costs. </p>
<p>For many AAA publishers making new games, it might be time to course-correct from the red live-service ocean to the bluer single-player one – or at least shift some more resources to solo experiences. </p>
<p>The insights in this article are the tip of the iceberg of the <a href="https://www.midiaresearch.com/reports/single-player-is-safer-and-has-more-opportunities-amid-live-service-challenges">full report</a>, which also looks at what exactly gamers are looking for in new games, what drives them to purchase, low-hanging fruit for publishers, and more. </p>

However, edge devices often struggle with limited computing power, memory, and bandwidth, requiring collaboration across multiple devices to run and speed up LLM inference. Pipeline parallelism, the mainstream solution, is inefficient for single-user scenarios, while tensor parallelism struggles with frequent communications. In this paper, we argue that tensor parallelism can be more effective than pipeline on low-resource devices, and present a compute- and memory-efficient tensor parallel inference system, named TPI-LLM, to serve 70B-scale models. TPI-LLM keeps sensitive raw data local in the users' devices and introduces a sliding window memory scheduler to dynamically manage layer weights during inference, with disk I/O latency overlapped with the computation and communication. This allows larger models to run smoothly on memory-limited devices. We analyze the communication bottleneck and find that link latency, not bandwidth, emerges as the main issue, so a star-based allreduce algorithm is implemented. Through extensive experiments on both emulated and real testbeds, TPI-LLM demonstrated over 80% less time-to-first-token and token latency compared to Accelerate, and over 90% compared to Transformers and Galaxy, while cutting the peak memory footprint of Llama 2-70B by 90%, requiring only 3.1 GB of memory for 70B-scale models.

<div xmlns:plos="http://plos.org"><h2>Abstract</h2><div><p>Animal research indicates that a combination of physical activity and sensory enrichment has the largest and the only sustaining effect on adult neuroplasticity. Dancing has been suggested as a human homologue to this combined intervention as it poses demands on both physical and cognitive functions. For the present exploratory study, we designed an especially challenging dance program in which our elderly participants constantly had to learn novel and increasingly difficult choreographies. This six-month-long program was compared to conventional fitness training matched for intensity. An extensive pre/post-assessment was performed on the 38 participants (63–80 y), covering general cognition, attention, memory, postural and cardio-respiratory performance, neurotrophic factors and–most crucially–structural MRI using an exploratory analysis. For analysis of MRI data, a new method of voxel-based morphometry (VBM) designed specifically for pairwise longitudinal group comparisons was employed. Both interventions increased physical fitness to the same extent. Pronounced differences were seen in the effects on brain volumes: Dancing compared to conventional fitness activity led to larger volume increases in more brain areas, including the cingulate cortex, insula, corpus callosum and sensorimotor cortex. Only dancing was associated with an increase in plasma BDNF levels. Regarding cognition, both groups improved in attention and spatial memory, but no significant group differences emerged. The latter finding may indicate that cognitive benefits may develop later and after structural brain changes have taken place. The present results recommend our challenging dance program as an effective measure to counteract detrimental effects of aging on the brain.</p>

<div xmlns:plos="http://plos.org" id="section1"><h2>Introduction</h2><p>Aging is associated with a reduction in brain volumes, mainly in the prefrontal and temporal cortices. Regions such as the occipital cortex, on the other hand, show relatively few alterations throughout the lifespan [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref001">1</a>,<a href="#pone.0196636.ref002">2</a>]. The changes affect both gray [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref002">2</a>,<a href="#pone.0196636.ref003">3</a>] and white matter [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref004">4</a>]. The cortical volume decrease (i.e., atrophy) is not primarily caused by a loss of neurons but is due to an age-related shrinking of cells and reduced synaptic density [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref002">2</a>,<a href="#pone.0196636.ref005">5</a>]. In white matter, aging generates axonal deflections, resulting in defective neuronal transmission. Again, the most deflections are observed in the prefrontal cortex [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref006">6</a>] and are associated with working memory and executive dysfunction [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref007">7</a>].</p>
<p>These age-related changes, however, are not inevitable. It has become clear over the past several years that the aging brain is capable of neuroplasticity. This raises the possibility of counteracting the detrimental effects of aging on the brain. Most studies in this regard have investigated the effects of physical fitness on the aging brain. For example, Colcombe et al. (2006) reported that six months of aerobic training, in comparison to an anaerobic stretching program, led to a significant volume increase at multiple sites of the elderly subjects’ brains [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref008">8</a>]. Others found volume and perfusion of the hippocampus, a brain region crucial for memory consolidation, to be related to the physical fitness levels of seniors [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref009">9</a>, <a href="#pone.0196636.ref010">10</a>, <a href="#pone.0196636.ref011">11</a>]. It has been suggested that this adult neuroplasticity is mediated by BDNF, a neurotrophic factor that is also found in human blood [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref012">12</a>, <a href="#pone.0196636.ref013">13</a>]. BDNF is an important growth factor supporting multiple functions in the CNS, including synaptic plasticity [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref014">14</a>, <a href="#pone.0196636.ref015">15</a>, <a href="#pone.0196636.ref016">16</a>, <a href="#pone.0196636.ref017">17</a>, <a href="#pone.0196636.ref018">18</a>]. It has been suggested that release of BDNF from the brain is the source for circulating BDNF after physical exercise [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref019">19</a>, <a href="#pone.0196636.ref020">20</a>]. An increase in circulating BDNF levels due to physical exercise has already been investigated by different groups [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref021">21</a>] and seems to depend on exercise intensity and the type of training [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref022">22</a>, <a href="#pone.0196636.ref023">23</a>, <a href="#pone.0196636.ref024">24</a>]. Erickson et al. (2011), for instance, demonstrate that increased hippocampal volume is associated with a greater volume of serum BDNF in seniors engaged in one year of aerobic training. From animal research, it is known that a combination of physical exercise and sensory enrichment has the strongest impact on neuroplasticity [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref025">25</a>, <a href="#pone.0196636.ref026">26</a>]. Moreover, only this combination guarantees that newborn neurons survive in the long run [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref026">26</a>]. For humans, dancing has been suggested as a homologue of this combined training, as it involves sensory, motor and cognitive challenges [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref027">27</a>, <a href="#pone.0196636.ref028">28</a>]. To the best of our knowledge, only three published studies have assessed the possible impact of dancing on the brain so far [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref029">29</a>, <a href="#pone.0196636.ref030">30</a>, <a href="#pone.0196636.ref031">31</a>]. However, these studies were cross-sectional observational studies that compared the brains of professional dancers to those of non-professionals. With such studies, there is an inevitable possibility that life-style factors other than those of interest contributed to the observed differences. Moreover, professional dancing is hardly comparable to what can be achieved in untrained healthy seniors. Therefore, in the current study, we designed a novel dance program that, on the one hand, was tailored to the needs of healthy seniors (e.g., safety) but, on the other hand, was designed to continuously challenge them by introducing new and increasingly difficult choreographies throughout the intervention. The effects of this dancing program were compared with an active, not passive, well-established sport fitness program, as we wanted to test whether our new intervention is truly superior to conventional ones. Hence, the control group engaged in sportive exercises that involved mainly repetitive exercises such as cycling. These activities were comparable regarding their cardiovascular demands but not their cognitive and coordinative demands. With this approach, we should be able to distinguish the specific effects of the dance training program from other factors, especially physical fitness. Consistent with this approach, on the brain level, we made use of a new symmetric VBM analysis method especially designed to compare longitudinal group differences.</p>
</div>

<div xmlns:plos="http://plos.org" id="section2"><h2>Materials and methods</h2>
<div id="section1"><h3>Subjects</h3>
<p>Approval for the study was obtained from the ethics committee of the Otto-von-Guericke University, Magdeburg. All subjects signed a written informed consent and received payment for their participation. This study has been registered subsequently at DRKS (DRKS00012605), a WHO-accepted platform, in terms of omission (<a href="#pone.0196636.s008">S1</a>, <a href="#pone.0196636.s009">S2</a> and <a href="#pone.0196636.s010">S3</a> Files). The authors confirm that all ongoing and related trials for this intervention are registered. Sixty-two normal volunteers, who responded to a local advertisement, were screened. Subjects with any neurological condition, metallic implants, claustrophobia, tinnitus, BMI ≤30, high blood pressure (systolic≤140 mmHg), diabetes mellitus, intensive physical engagement (more than 1 hour/week) and abnormal performance in a cognitive screening test (MMSE &lt; 27)[<a href="#pone.0196636.ref032">32</a>] and a test devoted to depressive symptoms (BDI-II &gt; 13) [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref033">33</a>] were excluded. Fifty-two seniors (25 males; 27 females) aged 63–80 years were then randomly assigned to the experimental dance group (DG) and the control sport group (SG) controlling for age, MMSE status and physical fitness. We had some drop-outs during the training period (<a href="#pone-0196636-g001">Fig 1</a>), including subjects who did not reach the adherence rate of 70% (6 subjects) or got seriously sick (6 subjects) or who were unsatisfied with the group assignment (2 subjects). This left us with 38 complete data sets (<a href="#pone.0196636.s001">S1 Table</a>).</p>
</div>

<div id="section2"><h3>Interventions</h3>
<p>The training conditions in both groups were almost identical regarding intensity, frequency and duration. We also controlled for psychosocial effects by providing a group-based program in both study arms. Furthermore, the SG also enjoyed musical accompaniment. Both interventions occurred twice a week, lasted 90 minutes per session and were provided for six months. To control for the conditional load in both groups, we measured the heart frequency in every single training session after warm-up twice: during the main part and after cool down.</p>

<div id="section1"><h4>Dance intervention.</h4><p>A qualified dance instructor supervised every training session. The focus of this program was on continuous learning of new movement patterns and choreographies, thereby including coordination training and learning of specific dancing skills. Subjects were trained to accurately memorize and access different rhythms and step sequences in space, all under accuracy and time pressure. In brief, the dance intervention was divided into two blocks, each lasting three months. Each block comprised the teaching of choreographies of five different genres: line dance, jazz dance, rock ‘n’ roll, Latin-American dance and square dance. Coordinative demands and time pressure were increased in the second block by demanding more complex dance moves and introducing more beats per minute in the music.</p>
</div>

<div id="section2"><h4>Sport intervention.</h4><p>The SG trained according to scientific guidelines and recommendations of health sports [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref034">34</a>] and was also supervised by a qualified trainer. Unlike the dancers, SG participants performed the same exercises repeatedly. Each session included three different units: endurance training, strength-endurance training and flexibility training. Each unit lasted 20 minutes. The endurance training was performed on bicycle ergometers with the intensity adjusted to the individual training heart frequency. The strength-endurance unit implied training with equipment such as barbells, rubber bands, Redondo balls, gymnastic sticks and fitness balls. We avoided combined arm and leg movements in order to keep coordinative demands low.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="section3"><h3>Structural MRI scanning protocol</h3>
<p>Magnetic resonance imaging was performed on a 3 Tesla Siemens MAGNETOM Verio scanner (Syngo MR B17). A 3-D structural MRI was acquired of each subject using a T-1-weighted MPRAGE sequence (224 sagittal slices, voxel size: 0.8 x 0.8 x 0.8 mm<sup>3</sup>, TR: 2500 ms, TE: 3,47 ms, TI: 1000 ms, flip angle: 7°).</p>

<div id="section1"><h4>Voxel-based morphometry for pairwise longitudinal group comparison.</h4><p>Since systematic bias in longitudinal image registration has recently become an issue, we used a relatively new VBM method implemented in SPM 12. This method has been developed especially for the analysis within longitudinal studies [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref035">35</a>]. It counteracts biases from asymmetric processing, where within-subject image processing often treats one time-point differently from the others. With this new approach, it is possible to directly compare the effects of one intervention vs the other (dance vs sport) on gray and white matter structures [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref036">36</a>].</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="section4"><h3>Analysis of BDNF</h3>
<p>The BDNF serum and plasma levels were determined using a sandwich ELISA system (BDNF DuoSets; R&amp;D Systems, Wiesbaden, Germany) as described previously [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref040">40</a>, <a href="#pone.0196636.ref041">41</a>]. Blood samples were taken in the morning under fasting conditions.</p>
</div>

<div id="section5"><h3>Cognitive assessments</h3>
<p>We applied an extensive battery of cognitive tests that probed attention (alertness, Go/Nogo, divided attention, flexibility) [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref042">42</a>], processing speed (trail making test) [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref043">43</a>], verbal word fluency [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref044">44</a>], short-term and working memory (digit span forward and backward of the Wechsler-Memory Scale) [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref045">45</a>], verbal episodic memory (verbal learning and memory task) [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref046">46</a>] and visuospatial memory (Rey-Osterrieth-Complex-Figure Test) [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref047">47</a>].</p>
</div>

<div id="section6"><h3>Physical fitness assessment</h3>
<p>We employed the Physical Working Capacity 130 Test (PWC130) on a bicycle ergometer to assess endurance-related fitness. The test reflects the linear relationship between the heart rate during submaximal exercise and exercise load and highly correlates to VO<sub>2</sub>max [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref048">48</a>].</p>
</div>

<div id="section7"><h3>Statistical analysis</h3>

<div id="section1"><h4>MRI data processing and analysis.</h4><p>Before preprocessing, all structural images were checked for artifacts, and the center point was placed on the anterior commissure. T1-weighted images of baseline and post measures of each subject were taken to run a pairwise longitudinal registration. The second step included the segmentation of gray and white matter as well of CSF for all average images. To measure volumetric changes in gray and white matter, every average image of each subject was disguised with the 3-D segmented maps of gray and white matter. Subsequently, spatial normalization using DARTEL (Diffeomorphic Anatomical Registration Through Exponentiated Lie Algebra) [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref036">36</a>] was applied in the standardized MNI space. The normalized, segmented images were smoothed using an 8-mm FWHM isotropic Gaussian kernel. For each subject, normalized and smoothed images displaying volume changes in gray and white matter were created. Since we were especially interested in group differences, we investigated only average images for each individual, as in previous studies [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref037">37</a>]. Group analyses using t-tests for independent samples compared volume changes in both gray and white matter between the two intervention groups. Co-variables such as age, sex and intracranial volume were entered in the analysis. For both groups, aligned t-contrasts (dance&gt;sport; sport&gt;dance) were calculated. As in previous longitudinal studies [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref038">38</a>, <a href="#pone.0196636.ref039">39</a>], we applied a threshold of p&lt; 0.001 (uncorrected) across the whole brain with a minimal cluster size of 50 voxel for gray and white matter.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="section8"><h3>Cognitive and physical data</h3>
<p>Explorative analysis for cognitive and physical data was performed using SPSS (SPSS 22 Inc./IBM). Intervention effects were tested using repeated-measurement ANOVAS with group (dance, sport) as the between-subject factor and time (pre, post) as the within-subject factor.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div xmlns:plos="http://plos.org" id="section3"><h2>Results</h2><p>To assess baseline differences between the dance and sport groups we analyzed gray and whiter matter volume using voxel-based morphometry. Two-sample t-tests revealed no significant group differences. Baseline values of gray (p = .340) and white matter volume (p = .497) were similar for both groups and did not differ.</p>

<div id="section1"><h3>Gray matter changes</h3>
<p>After the intervention, compared to the SG, DG participants showed significantly larger volumes in multiple frontal and temporal cortical areas, including the anterior und medial cingulate cortex, the left supplementary motor area, the left precentral gyrus, the left medial frontal gyrus, the left insula, the left superior temporal gyrus and the left postcentral gyrus. The red-colored regions in <a href="#pone-0196636-g002">Fig 2</a> give an overview of these brain areas. The participants from the SG showed greater volume increases compared to the dancers in occipital and cerebellar regions. These included the primary visual cortex, the left lingual gyrus, the right fusiform gyrus, the right temporal pole and the right lobe of the cerebellum. The blue-colored regions in <a href="#pone-0196636-g002">Fig 2</a> give an overview of these brain regions. The corresponding MNI-coordinates and specific values for the contrast dance &gt; sport and sport &gt; dance are presented in <a href="#pone.0196636.s002">S2 Table</a>.</p>

<div id="section2"><h3>White matter changes</h3>
<p>Participants from the DG demonstrated larger volume increases in the truncus and splenium of the corpus callosum. An increased volume was also observed in the right and left frontal and right parietal white matter. These regions are presented in <a href="#pone-0196636-g003">Fig 3</a>. The SG showed greater volume increases than the dancers in the right temporal and right occipital white matter.

<div id="section3"><h3>Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)</h3>
<p>Whereas no intervention effects were observed in BDNF serum values, the plasma values showed an increase after dance training. This is confirmed by a time x group interaction with F(1,35) = 4,3; p = 0.046; η<sup>2</sup> = ,115. Although the dance group started with a lower plasma BDNF level, a t-test did not reveal a significant between-group difference at baseline (<a href="#pone.0196636.s004">S4 Table</a>). To exclude interindividual variations, we calculated intraindividual changes in BDNF levels after intervention. Again, DG participants showed significantly larger increases in plasma BDNF level than SG participants (<a href="#pone-0196636-g004">Fig 4</a>).</p>
<p>As it is evident from the figure, the increase in BDNF level was significantly increased in the DG compared with the SG (Mann-Whitney’s U-test, p &lt; 0.018).</p>
</div>

<div id="section4"><h3>Cognitive results</h3>
<p>We found a main effect of time for alertness with acoustic cues (F (1,37) = 9,48; p = .004; η<sup>2</sup> = ,218) but no time x group interaction. Visuospatial memory improved after both trainings, demonstrated by a main effect of time for immediate (F(1,37) = 38,04; p &lt; .001; η<sup>2</sup> = ,54) as well as for delayed recall (F(1,37) = 28,37; p &lt; .001; η<sup>2</sup> = ,455). There was, however, no significant group x time interaction (all p-values &gt; 0.6). Other cognitive functions did not change in either group (all p-values &gt; 0.28). For detailed information see <a href="#pone.0196636.s005">S5</a>, <a href="#pone.0196636.s006">S6</a> and <a href="#pone.0196636.s007">S7</a> Tables.</p>

<div id="section5"><h3>Physical fitness results</h3>
<p>After six months of training, both groups enhanced their aerobic fitness, indicated by a significant main effect of time for the PWC 130 test (F(1,32) = 11,4; p = 0.002; η<sup>2</sup> = ,275). No group differences emerged.</p>

<div xmlns:plos="http://plos.org" id="section4"><h2>Discussion</h2><p>This study examined the effects of a specially designed dance training program requiring constant learning of new choreographies compared to a conventional sportive fitness training with mainly repetitive exercises on brain structure and function in healthy seniors. We used a new voxel-based morphometry approach specifically designed for a pairwise longitudinal group comparison. Both groups improved their fitness levels. However, as there was no group difference, the observed differences in brain plasticity cannot simply be attributed to physical fitness but must reflect the specific components of the intervention programs.</p>

<div id="section1"><h3>Gray matter changes in dancers</h3>
<p>In general, dancing induced more wide-spread gray matter increases than the sportive control program. The dancers showed gray matter volume increases after training in the anterior and medial cingulate cortex, in the left supplementary motor area, in the left sided precentral gyrus, in the left medial frontal gyrus, in the left superior temporal gyrus, in the left insula and in the left post-central gyrus.</p>
<p>The anterior cingulate cortex and the medial frontal gyri are mainly associated with working memory [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref049">49</a>, <a href="#pone.0196636.ref050">50</a>]. These areas also form the basis of executive functions, cognitive control and attention regulation. In addition, the cingulate gyrus is also a part of the limbic system and is engaged in the storage of new information in long-term-memory, as well as in the retrieval of stored information [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref050">50</a>]. In the insula, the networks of working memory and attention overlap and potentially interact [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref051">51</a>, <a href="#pone.0196636.ref052">52</a>]. Dancing poses demands on both attention and memory. Our dancing program was intended to keep the dancers in a constant learning process by confronting them continuously with novel motion sequences. They had to attentively follow the movements of the instructor to retain, retrieve and perform the choreographies under several conditions of pressure. Since the genre or the dancing style was changed every second week, no monotony could evolve. Rather this approach placed high demands on attentional and memory processes, especially working memory [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref053">53</a>]. These cognitive functions usually underlie an age-related degradation making the results especially promising with respect to a preventive potential.</p>
<p>Enhanced volumes after dance training were also seen in motor and somatosensory areas. Among these were the precentral gyri and the supplementary motor area. These areas have a preprocessing and executive function within the motor system [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref054">54</a>, <a href="#pone.0196636.ref055">55</a>]. Again, the increased volumes of these regions can be attributed to the complexity of the dance movement patterns. The simultaneous use of different body parts for different rhythms promotes the coordination of the whole body. In addition, the changing tempi of the music induce a dynamic and temporal variability in the execution of partial (segmented) and whole-body movements. Dancing also increased the volume of the postcentral gyrus. In this area, somatosensory fibers end, which convey information from proprioceptive organs such as neuromuscular spindles, joint and sinew receptors. Other than the fitness program, our dancing program involved manifold steps and constant shifts of balance and regular turns. Hence, it can be assumed that body movement perception was trained as well as the perception of the location and position of the body and body segments to each other in space. This kind of feedback (reafference) to the cortex is needed to align and refine movement processes.</p>
<p>Additionally, the superior temporal gyrus displayed an increased gray matter volume after six months of dance training. This part of the temporal lobe is associated with episodic memory and deteriorates early in Alzheimer’s disease [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref008">8</a>]. Furthermore, it is closely linked to the adjacent superior temporal sulcus, which is crucial for auditory short-term memory [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref056">56</a>] and audio-visual integration [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref057">57</a>, <a href="#pone.0196636.ref058">58</a>]. While learning to dance, participants needed to keep the verbal instructions of the teacher in mind. Another important aspect constitutes the audio-visual integration of stimuli because dancing involves multisensory stimulation with visual, sensory and auditory input. For example, dancers have to visually observe and sense their movements while they listen to music and have to set these pieces of information in accordance with each other.</p>
</div>

<div id="section2"><h3>White matter changes in dancers</h3>
<p>White matter volume increases associated with dancing were seen in close spatial proximity to the cortical changes in frontal and parietal parts of the brains. Most outstanding was the enlargement of the corpus callosum, which carries the largest part of the commissure fibers and connects nearly all parts of the hemispheres. Hence, the corpus callosum ensures the communication between both cerebral hemispheres. Aging leads to degradation of this region, a process that has been associated with age-related loss in cognitive performance [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref059">59</a>]. The present findings indicate that dancing can intensify the connectivity and interaction between both cerebral hemispheres. This appears plausible given that different motor, somatosensory and cognitive areas have to communicate in order to accomplish the complex task of dancing.</p>
</div>

<div id="section3"><h3>Brain changes after sport training</h3>
<p>Compared to dancing, the completion of the sport program led to fewer and smaller brain volume increases. For both white and gray matter, they were seen mainly in the cerebellum and higher visual and adjacent areas. The increased volume in the cerebellum seems plausible. Compared to dancing, the movements of the sport group had a cyclic and repetitive character. After the initial phase of training, these routines hardly required any conscious control; instead, they were performed automatically [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref028">28</a>]. The cerebellum is crucial for unconscious planning and execution of movements [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref060">60</a>]. Furthermore, together with the basal ganglia, it constitutes the basis of procedural memory [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref061">61</a>, <a href="#pone.0196636.ref062">62</a>]. In procedural memory, the retrieval of movement programs does not underlie conscious cognitive control and does not require focused attention. In sum, in contrast to dancing, the fitness training required less cognitive resources.</p>
<p>The volume change in visual areas including the right fusiform gyrus came rather unexpectedly. Initially, it is unclear why fitness training should boost areas related to visual perception, especially that of faces, more than dancing [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref063">63</a>]. However, as outlined above, dancing stresses audio-visual integration rather than visual perception per se. The fitness training, on the other hand, with its low cognitive demands, may have seduced participants to focus their attention on visual input–especially the faces of the other participants.</p>
</div>

<div id="section4"><h3>Possible neurophysiological basis of the observed volume changes</h3>
<p>Animal models have suggested that age limits the capacity for adaptive changes related to dynamic neural network modulations induced by environmental and intrinsic changes [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref064">64</a>]. On the other hand, it is known that new neurons are generated in the vertebrate brain throughout the life span [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref065">65</a>]. This neurogenesis increases with physical exercise and occurs in the hippocampus as well as in the subventricular zone around the lateral ventricles [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref066">66</a>]. However, a large fraction of the new neurons does not survive [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref026">26</a>]. It was stated that while exercise increases the rate of neurogenesis, environmental enrichment increases the ratio of new neurons that survive and get incorporated into the lattice of the existing neural network [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref067">67</a>]. In this respect, dancing, which can be considered a combination of exercise and sensory enrichment, may have a similar potential for inducing long-lasting survival of newly created neurons. BDNF may be a possible mediating factor of adult neuroplasticity [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref013">13</a>]. In the present study, BDNF plasma levels increased during the dance training. BDNF is known to be important for synaptogenesis, dendritogenesis as well as neurogenesis [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref014">14</a>, <a href="#pone.0196636.ref015">15</a>, <a href="#pone.0196636.ref016">16</a>, <a href="#pone.0196636.ref017">17</a>, <a href="#pone.0196636.ref018">18</a>]. Activity-dependent release of BDNF during dancing, a training program that involves attention and memory process could underlie the observed volume increases of gray matter. In Alzheimer’s disease, known for its neurodegenerative process and cognitive decline, BDNF levels in the brain and also in the blood were found to be significantly reduced [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref068">68</a>]. Therefore, the observed increase in gray matter volume associated with the increase in circulating BDNF support the idea of BDNF-induced structural changes in the brain.</p>
</div>

<div id="section5"><h3>Cognitive effects</h3>
<p>Compared with the effects on the brain, the effects of the trainings on cognitive functions were rather low and showed no significant differences between the groups. Improvements of some attentional processes and of visual spatial memory were observed in both groups. This raises the general question of why the effects on cognition were so small compared to those induced in the brain. Two explanations will be discussed: First, the tests were not sensitive for revealing changes in cognitive processes. Second, the brain changes may precede the changes in measurable behavior, so that the latter would have required a longer intervention program. This assumption is currently under investigation in our laboratory.</p>
</div>

<div id="section6"><h3>Limitations</h3>
<p>Like other studies on training induced neuroplasticity [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref038">38</a>, <a href="#pone.0196636.ref039">39</a>], our MRI results are based on uncorrected data because with the small sample size, the results would not have survived traditional corrections such as FDR. Next, we tested highly selected, healthy and motivated samples of elder adults; hence, whether the results generalize to the elderly population as a whole needs to be investigated in future studies. Lastly, the assessment of subcortical structures with VBM has been criticized as being less reliable [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref069">69</a>]. Future studies should make use of DTI white matter tractography to assess white matter changes.</p>
</div>

<div id="section7"><h3>Conclusions</h3>
<p>We were able to demonstrate in a randomized intervention trial that dancing has a strong potential to induce more positive effects on brain volumes in elderly people. Previous research has mainly focused on other, more monotonic aerobic exercises such as running, walking, cycling (endurance training) or on anaerobic strength and stretching exercises. Compared to these standard fitness programs, our specially designed six-month dancing program increased volumes in regions which relate to higher cognitive processes such as working memory and attention and which are especially affected by age-related decline. In our view, the more pronounced effects of dancing on the human brain can be explained by the fact that dancing promotes a large number of processes at the same time: spatial orientation, movement coordination, balance, endurance, interaction and communication. Furthermore, by presenting our participants with ever new choreographies, our program induced a constant learning processes. This dance training program does not need special requirements, has a low risk of accidents and can be implemented at low costs. Therefore, it endorses itself as an appropriate measure to counteract age-related declines in brain structure.</p>

By contrast, some scientists — notably </span><a href="https://ecologyandevolution.cornell.edu/robert-warren-howarth" rel="">Robert Howarth</a><span> at Cornell University — have argued that when fugitive emissions from tankers are added to the significant upstream emissions from gas extraction, and depending on the length of the journey taken and the fuel used, LNG may be responsible for </span><em>more</em><span> CO2-equivalent emissions than coal.</span></p><p><span>Over the past few months, we’ve been doing an increasing amount of work on LNG —&nbsp;our </span><a href="https://docs.datadesk.eco/public/australia-japan-lng/" rel="">latest briefing</a><span> (also available </span><a href="https://docs.datadesk.eco/public/australia-japan-lng-jp/" rel="">in Japanese</a><span>), produced for Jubilee Australia, looks at how Japanese companies are re-selling Australian LNG to neighbouring countries in Southeast Asia, at the same time as funding new import terminals and gas-fired generation capacity in those same countries.

I particularly like the way that the two images — taken less than an hour and a half apart —&nbsp;complement each other: the bright colours of the detected methane plume, invisible to the naked eye, shade into clouds visible in the underlying optical image.

Drawing on their experience of measuring emissions directly on board LNG-powered ships and at export terminals, they pointed to a number of potential sources, ranging from engine slip (unburned methane in exhaust fumes) from the vessel’s auxiliary engine to direct leaks from the terminal’s LNG loading arms. They also cautioned that wind conditions can make it hard to attribute plumes directly to sources on the ground —&nbsp;an important consideration, as according to </span><a href="https://www.wunderground.com/history/daily/us/la/cameron/KLCH/date/2021-4-28" rel="">historical data</a><span> 28 April 2021 was a relatively windy day in Louisiana.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F79292e00-0702-4829-922e-1120ad70a3bd_1440x704.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F79292e00-0702-4829-922e-1120ad70a3bd_1440x704.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F79292e00-0702-4829-922e-1120ad70a3bd_1440x704.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F79292e00-0702-4829-922e-1120ad70a3bd_1440x704.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F79292e00-0702-4829-922e-1120ad70a3bd_1440x704.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F79292e00-0702-4829-922e-1120ad70a3bd_1440x704.png" width="1440" height="704" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/79292e00-0702-4829-922e-1120ad70a3bd_1440x704.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:704,&quot;width&quot;:1440,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:366805,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F79292e00-0702-4829-922e-1120ad70a3bd_1440x704.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F79292e00-0702-4829-922e-1120ad70a3bd_1440x704.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F79292e00-0702-4829-922e-1120ad70a3bd_1440x704.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F79292e00-0702-4829-922e-1120ad70a3bd_1440x704.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption><span>A diagram from the </span><a href="https://theicct.org/publication/fumes-characterizing-methane-emissions-from-lng-fueled-ships-using-drones-helicopters-and-on-board-measurements-jan24/" rel="">FUMES</a><span> study, showing how researchers used drones to measure methane emissions from ships.</span></figcaption></figure></div><p><span>According to Carbon Mapper’s estimates, the plume we’re looking at here was emitting methane at a rate of around 3.4 tonnes per hour. This is as much as some of the largest plumes observed from static oil and gas infrastructure in countries notorious for their methane-intensive upstream oil and gas production —&nbsp;for example, </span><a href="https://data.carbonmapper.org/?details=CH4_1B2_250m_5.99642_31.77781%3Fstatus%3Dnot_deleted#12.96/31.78964/6.00802" rel="">Algeria</a><span> and </span><a href="https://data.carbonmapper.org/?details=CH4_1B2_250m_54.20285_38.55782%3Fstatus%3Dnot_deleted#12.91/38.55775/54.21379" rel="">Turkmenistan</a><span>.</span></p><p>But ships are different from oil wells. Rather than emitting methane constantly, the largest emissions from LNG tankers appear to happen at specific times, during cargo loading and unloading or during bunkering (refuelling). Unlike oil wells, ships move around, and current satellites have a hard time detecting methane plumes over water, meaning that researchers without direct access to the ships are left poring over chance images like the one we’ve found. All this makes it especially challenging to come up with reliable estimates for the LNG shipping industry’s emissions as a whole.</p><p><span>There is hope, however. As more and more satellite-based methane emissions data comes online, repeating this analysis will likely yield more and more observations linked to LNG terminals around the world —&nbsp;and, in some cases, plumes emerging directly from LNG tankers. This data will feed into projects like GEM’s </span><a href="https://globalenergymonitor.org/projects/global-methane-emitters-tracker/" rel="">Global Methane Emitters Tracker</a><span> and eventually into the methodologies behind major initiatives like </span><a href="https://climatetrace.org/" rel="">ClimateTRACE</a><span>, where efforts are currently focussed on estimating emissions from the global shipping industry.</span></p><p><span>Speaking on a </span><a href="https://www.cleaningup.live/this-is-a-narrative-war-how-to-win-the-climate-argument-ep172-john-marshall/" rel="">recent episode</a><span> of the </span><em>Cleaning Up</em><span> podcast, Bryony Worthington described an advertising campaign around pollution that she’d been involved with in the 2000s: “We had a reasonable budget, and we took some stock footage, and we coloured in the gases so you could see a luminescent colour that we added to all the exhaust of the cars and the chimneys, and it all built up in the atmosphere. And the tagline was, ‘if you could see the blanket of gases, you’d do something about it.’” With methane emissions becoming more visible by the day, we hope this maxim holds true.</span></p></div></div>]]></description>

This was the culmination of nearly three years of litigation against Sable, but it wasn’t the end of the story.&nbsp;</p><p>Today we’re pleased to announce that the litigation against Sable has finally concluded on terms that we believe send a strong message to patent trolls everywhere — if you bring meritless patent claims against Cloudflare, we will fight back and we will win.</p><p>We’re also pleased to announce additional prizes in <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/jengo/sable-prior-art-search/"><u>Project Jengo</u></a>, and to make a final call for submissions before we determine the winners of the Final Awards. As a reminder, Project Jengo is Cloudflare’s effort to fight back against patent trolls by flipping the incentive structure that has encouraged the growth of patent trolls who extract settlements out of companies using frivolous lawsuits. We do this by asking the public to help identify prior art that can invalidate any of the patents that a troll holds, not just the ones that are asserted against Cloudflare. We’ve already given out over $125,000 to individuals since the <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/project-jengo/"><u>launch of Project Jengo in 2017</u></a>, and we’re looking forward to celebrating the successful end of the Sable iteration of Project Jengo with our Final Awards!</p><p>To learn more about how things concluded with Sable and next steps in Project Jengo, read on.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3>Background</h3><p>For anyone just joining us on this odyssey, here is a little background on how we got here:</p><p>Sable sued Cloudflare back in March 2021. Sable is a patent troll. It doesn’t make, develop, innovate, or sell anything. Sable IP is merely a shell entity formed to monetize (make money from) an ancient patent portfolio acquired by Sable Networks from Caspian Networks in 2006. <a href="https://www.lightreading.com/cable-technology/caspian-closes-its-doors"><u>Caspian Networks was a router company that went out of business nearly 20 years ago</u></a>. Using Caspian’s old patents, Sable sued Cloudflare and many other companies, including Cisco, Fortinet, Check Point, SonicWall, and Juniper Networks, alleging patent infringement. While these other companies resolved their disputes with Sable out of court, Cloudflare fought back.&nbsp;</p><p>Sable initially asserted around 100 claims from four different patents against Cloudflare, accusing multiple Cloudflare products and features of infringement. Sable’s patents — the old Caspian Networks patents — related to hardware-based router technologies common over 20 years ago. Sable’s infringement arguments stretched these patent claims to their limits (and beyond) as Sable tried to apply Caspian’s hardware-based technologies to Cloudflare’s modern software-defined services delivered on the cloud.</p><p>Cloudflare fought back against Sable by launching a <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/jengo/sable-prior-art-search/"><u>new round of Project Jengo</u></a>, Cloudflare’s prior art contest, seeking prior art to invalidate all of Sable’s patents.</p><p>After years of Cloudflare aggressively litigating against Sable’s patents before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and the district court, Sable was left with only one claim from one patent to assert against Cloudflare at trial. If you’d like to know more, we described those battles, in which Cloudflare successfully eliminated around 99% of Sable’s claims, in more detail in a <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-defeats-patent-troll-sable-at-trial/"><u>prior blog post</u></a>.</p><p>Sable and Cloudflare came together in a five-day jury trial in Waco, Texas in February 2024. At trial, Sable did its best to try to map its decades-old router technology onto Cloudflare’s modern software-based architecture. But Sable’s case was riddled with technical issues and its efforts backed only by the desire for a payout.</p><h3>The jury agrees: Cloudflare <u>does not infringe</u></h3><p>To defeat Sable’s claim of infringement we needed to explain to the jury — in clear and understandable terms — why what Cloudflare does is different from what was covered by claim 25 of Sable’s remaining patent, U.S. Patent No. <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US7012919B1/en?oq=7012919"><u>7,012,919</u></a> (the ’919 patent). To do this, we enlisted the help of one of our talented Cloudflare engineers, Eric Reeves, as well as <a href="https://engineering.washu.edu/faculty/Paul-Min.html"><u>Dr. Paul Min, Senior Professor of Electrical &amp; Systems Engineering at Washington University</u></a>, an expert in the field of computer networking. Eric and Dr. Min helped us explain to the jury the multiple reasons we didn’t infringe.</p>

          </figure><p><sup><i>From slide deck presented by Cloudflare to the jury during the trial</i></sup></p><p>First, we explained that the accused Cloudflare products (<a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/magic-transit/"><u>Magic Transit</u></a> and <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/argo-smart-routing/argo-for-packets/"><u>Argo for Packets</u></a>) do not route “flows” or “micro-flows” as required by claim 25. Instead, they handle packets individually, on a packet-by-packet basis. Indeed, processing each packet individually is important to the functioning of these products and Cloudflare’s DDoS and security services as a whole.</p><p>Eric also helped to tell our invention story to the jury. He explained how the Cloudflare team saw problems that needed to be solved, and built unique and innovative new products to solve them. He described the work that went into developing Magic Transit and Argo for Packets, and how these products are part of Cloudflare’s modern software-based approach, which is fundamentally different from the hardware-based technology of the ’919 patent. Together, Eric and Dr. Min explained how the benefits of Magic Transit and Argo for Packets enjoyed by Cloudflare’s customers are not attributable to any technology claimed by the ’919 patent.</p>

          </figure><p><sup><i>From slide deck presented by Cloudflare to the jury during the trial</i></sup></p><p>Second, we explained that Cloudflare doesn’t infringe because claim 25 of the ’919 patent requires certain processes to occur “at” ingress and egress line cards, and Cloudflare’s accused servers do not include line cards.</p>

          </figure><p><sup><i>From slide deck presented by Cloudflare to the jury during the trial</i></sup></p><p>As Dr. Min explained, “line cards” are a specific type of hardware — a physical hardware “card” — that are commonly used in routers. Sable’s witnesses could not deny that the technology of the ’919 patent was tied to old router technology. After all, Caspian Networks Inc. (where the ’919 patent inventors worked) was a router company. Caspian’s core products were routers, and we showed the jury documents describing Caspian’s routers, which used “flow-based” technology on physical hardware line cards.</p>

          </figure><p><sup><i>Trial exhibit, image of sample line card</i></sup></p><p>While Sable’s technical expert tried his hardest to convince the jury that various software and hardware components of Cloudflare’s servers constitute “line cards,” his explanations defied credibility. The simple fact is that Cloudflare’s servers do not have line cards.</p><p>Ultimately, the jury understood, returning a verdict that Cloudflare does not infringe claim 25 of the ‘919 patent.</p>

          </figure><p><sup><i>Excerpt from Verdict Form completed by the jury</i></sup></p><h3>The jury agrees: Sable’s patent claim is <u>invalid</u></h3><p>In addition to proving that we do not infringe, we also took on the challenge of proving to the jury that claim 25 of the ’919 patent is invalid and never should have been issued.</p><p>Proving invalidity to a jury is hard. The burden on the defendant is high: Cloudflare needed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that claim 25 is invalid.&nbsp; And, proving it by describing how the claim is obvious in light of the prior art is complicated.</p><p>To do this, we again relied on our technical expert, Dr. Min, to explain how two prior art references, U.S. Patent No. <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US6584071B1/en?oq=6584071"><u>6,584,071</u></a> (Kodialam) and U.S. Patent No. <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US6680933B1/en?oq=6680933"><u>6,680,933</u></a> (Cheeseman) together render claim 25 of the ’919 patent obvious. Kodialam and Cheeseman are patents from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nortel"><u>Nortel Networks</u></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucent_Technologies"><u>Lucent</u></a> relating to router technology developed in the late 1990s. Both are prior art to the ’919 patent (i.e., they pre-date the priority date of the ’919 patent), and when considered together by a person skilled in the area of computer engineering and computer networking technology, they rendered obvious the so-called invention of claim 25.</p>

          </figure><p><sup><i>Excerpt from Verdict Form completed by the jury</i></sup><sup>&nbsp;</sup></p><h3>Sable does not get its payday …</h3><p>Sable’s real motivation for suing Cloudflare — its desire for a payout — was made clear by Sable’s trial witnesses, who were unified only by their desire to present a wildly inflated view of the alleged “value” of the Sable patent and the damages allegedly owed by Cloudflare.&nbsp;</p><p>Sable’s attorneys tried their best to present their clients as reasonable businessmen, just trying to get what they’re owed for Cloudflare’s purported use of Sable’s patent. But Sable couldn’t hide its true colors from the jury. When Sable presented testimony from Brooks Borchers, the founder of Sable IP, Mr. Borchers was forced to admit that Sable IP is in the “business” of filing lawsuits.</p>

          </figure><p><sup><i>Excerpt from Borchers trial testimony</i></sup></p><p>&nbsp;In fact, Mr. Borchers was forced to admit that Sable’s approach is to sue first and ask questions later. Even among patent trolls, this is hardly a noble business practice.</p>

          </figure><p><sup><i>Excerpts from Borchers trial testimony</i></sup></p><p>What's more, Mr. Borchers and his lawyers have teamed up on cases like this before, following the same sue-first-and-ask-questions-later playbook in hopes of a payout. Sable’s true motivations for suing Cloudflare were on full display after this testimony, making Sable’s damages demand all the more galling.</p><p>Sable’s damages expert, Stephen Dell, told the jury that Sable was owed somewhere between <span>$</span>25 million and $94.2 million in damages. But, Mr. Dell was forced to admit to multiple flaws in his damages calculation, and Cloudflare’s damages expert Chris Bakewell explained to the jury how bad inputs and faulty assumptions led Mr. Dell to a wildly inflated damages figure. Indeed, after hearing Sable’s expert’s testimony, Judge Albright said he was “very skeptical” of Mr. Dell’s opinions, explaining that he was “very concerned that there’s not support for his methodology.”</p><p>In the end, Mr. Dell’s outsized damages demand didn’t matter because the jury found that Cloudflare did not infringe and that the asserted patent claim is invalid. But, it was revealing of Sable’s motivation (greed) and the lengths that it would go to try to get a payout.</p><p>When all was said and done, after all the testimony and argument, we were thrilled when the jury returned its verdict — after less than two hours of deliberations — finding across the board for Cloudflare. The jury’s verdict is truly a validation of our strong belief in the importance of standing up to patent trolls like Sable, and we are grateful for the jury’s time, attention and consideration!</p><h3>Sable admits defeat, and agrees to pay Cloudflare!</h3><p>A jury verdict is not the end of the road in a patent case ... there are post-trial motions, appeals, and other procedural hurdles to jump through before a case is truly over. Tired from the fight, and smarting from its loss, Sable decided it wanted to throw in the towel and end the fight once and for all.</p><p>In the end, Sable agreed to pay Cloudflare $225,000, grant Cloudflare a royalty-free license to its entire patent portfolio, and to dedicate its patents to the public, ensuring that Sable can never again assert them against another company.</p><p>Let’s repeat that first part, just to make sure everyone understands:&nbsp;</p><p>Sable, the patent troll that sued Cloudflare back in March 2021 asserting around 100 claims across four patents, in the end wound up paying Cloudflare. While this $225,000 can’t fully compensate us for the time, energy and frustration of having to deal with this litigation for nearly three years, it does help to even the score a bit. And we hope that it sends an important message to patent trolls everywhere to beware before taking on Cloudflare.</p>

This means that Sable will tell the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office that it gives up all of its legal rights to its patent portfolio. Sable can never again use these patents to sue for infringement; they can never again use these patents to try to make a quick buck.</p>

          </figure><p><sup><i>Excerpt from the Dedication to the Public and Royalty Free License Agreement between Sable and Cloudflare</i></sup></p><h3>To sum it up …</h3><p>Cloudflare fought back against the patent troll and we won. We not only defeated Sable's claims in court, we forced Sable to pay Cloudflare for the trouble, and we got Sable's patents dedicated to the public, ensuring that it can never assert these patents against any other company ever again. It was admittedly a lot of work for Cloudflare, but totally worth it.</p><h3>Project Jengo for Sable: Conclusion of the Case</h3><p>A crucial part of our efforts to secure this across-the-board win are our Project Jengo participants.</p><p>Since the <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/project-jengo-redux-cloudflares-prior-art-search-bounty-returns/"><u>launch of the Project Jengo for the Sable case</u></a>, we’ve received hundreds of prior art references from dedicated Project Jengo participants. So far we have awarded <span>$</span>70,000 in prizes to the winners of Chapters 1 through 8. And we still have $30,000 in prizes to award in the Final Awards.</p><p>This blog post marks the official “Conclusion of the Case” under the <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/jengo/sable-rules/"><u>Project Jengo Sable Rules</u></a>. We will continue to accept submissions during the 30-day Grace Period, which lasts until November 2, 2024, and then will move on to selecting winners of the Final Awards.</p><h3>We are thrilled to announce the winners of Chapters 7 and 8</h3><p>We publicly celebrated the <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/project-jengo-2-first-three-winners/"><u>Chapter 1</u></a>, <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/former-rd-engineer-wins-round-2-of-project-jengo-and-cloudflare-wins-at-the-patent-office/"><u>Chapter 2</u></a>, <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/arkansas-engineer-wins-round-3-of-project-jengo-and-cloudflare-continues-to-win-at-the-patent-office/"><u>Chapter 3</u></a> and <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/three-new-winners-of-project-jengo-and-more-defeats-for-the-patent-troll/"><u>Chapters 4-6</u></a> winners in previous blog posts. However, as the trial approached in the Sable case, we chose not to make public announcements for the Chapter 7 and 8 winners out of respect for the judicial process. Now that the case is over, we are delighted to give a big public shout out to the winners of Project Jengo Chapters 7 and 8!</p><p>We selected four total winners in Chapters 7 and 8, each receiving prizes of <span>$</span>5,000, for a grand total of $20,000. Our Chapter 7 winners, George W. and Madhu, each provided helpful and detailed charts containing element-by-element comparisons of the prior art to the relevant Sable patents. George W. is an electrical engineer and lawyer, who is active in the intellectual property community. He learned about Project Jengo in an article posted online, and thought it was a clever idea. The Chapter 8 winners, Jatin and Ketan, also provided thoughtful and detailed submissions. Jatin submitted two pieces of prior art that were particularly good references for Sable’s U.S. Patent No. 7,012,919, which contains the one claim that remained asserted against Cloudflare at trial.</p><p>We also want to again thank our prior chapter winners and everyone who participated in Project Jengo! We look forward to selecting the Final Awards winners — it will be fun to take a walk down memory lane re-reviewing the fantastic prior art submitted by our prior winners, and we can’t wait to check out the new submissions, too!

The difference between an implicit and explicit representation method is that the coordinates of the model are not directly addressable in INRs, which use a <a href="https://byjus.com/maths/continuous-function/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">continuous function</a>.</p><p>By contrast, Gaussian Splatting offers explicit and addressable X/Y/Z <a href="https://mathinsight.org/cartesian_coordinates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cartesian coordinates</a>, even though it uses Gaussian ellipses rather than <a href="https://archive.is/Tnl4i" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voxels</a> or other methods of depicting content in a 3D space.</p><p>The idea of using GSplat in a 2D space has been most prominently presented, the authors note, in the 2024 Chinese academic collaboration <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.08551" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GaussianImage</a>, which offered a 2D version of Gaussian Splatting, enabling inference frame rates of 1000fps. However, this model has no implementation related to image editing.</p><p>After GaMeS parametrization extracts the selected area into a Gaussian/mesh representation, the image is reconstructed using the Material Points Method (MPM) technique first outlined in a <a href="https://yuanming.taichi.graphics/publication/2018-mlsmpm/mls-mpm-cpic.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2018 CSAIL paper</a>.</p><p>In MiraGe, during the process of alteration, the Gaussian Splat exists as a guiding proxy for an equivalent mesh version, much as <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.01815.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">3DMM CGI models</a> are <a href="https://www.unite.ai/rignerf-a-new-deepfakes-method-that-uses-neural-radiance-fields/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">frequently used</a> as orchestration methods for implicit neural rendering techniques such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF).</p><p>In the process, two-dimensional objects are modeled in 3D space, and the parts of the image that are not being influenced are not visible to the end user, so that the contextual effect of the manipulations are not apparent until the process is concluded.</p><p>MiraGe can be integrated into the popular open source 3D program <a href="https://www.blender.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blender</a>, which is now <a href="https://github.com/benrugg/AI-Render" target="_blank" rel="noopener">frequently used</a> in AI-inclusive workflows, primarily for image-to-image purposes.</p><div id="attachment_207001"><p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-207001" src="https://www.unite.ai/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/blender-MiraGe.jpg" alt="A workflow for MiraGe in Blender, involving the movement of the arm of a figure depicted in a 2D image." width="1200" height="416" srcset="https://www.unite.ai/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/blender-MiraGe.jpg 1200w, https://www.unite.ai/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/blender-MiraGe-300x104.jpg 300w, https://www.unite.ai/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/blender-MiraGe-250x87.jpg 250w, https://www.unite.ai/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/blender-MiraGe-768x266.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-207001"><span>A workflow for MiraGe in Blender, involving the movement of the arm of a figure depicted in a 2D image.</span></p></div><p>The authors offer two versions of a deformation approach based on Gaussian Splatting – <em><i>Amorphous</i></em> and <em><i>Graphite</i></em>.</p><p>The Amorphous approach directly utilizes the GaMeS method, and allows the extracted 2D selection to move freely in 3D space, whereas the Graphite approach constrains the Gaussians to 2D space during initialization and training.</p><p>The researchers found that though the Amorphous approach might handle complex shapes better than Graphite, ‘tears' or rift artefacts were more evident, where the edge of the deformation aligns with the unaffected portion of the image*.</p><p>Therefore, they developed the aforementioned ‘mirror image' system:</p><p><em><i>‘[We] employ a novel approach utilizing two opposing cameras positioned along the Y axis, symmetrically aligned around the origin and directed towards one another. </i></em></p><p><em><i>‘The first camera is tasked with reconstructing the original image, while the second models the mirror reflection.

It appears that Amorphous-Mirage obtains the best detail, and Graphite-Mirage the best flexibility. Since both methods are presented in the paper, with their diverse strengths and weaknesses, the authors' preference, if any, does not appear to be clear at this time.</i></em></p><p><em><i>First published Thursday, October 3, 2024</i></em></p>   <p><a href="https://subscribe.unite.ai/"> <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.unite.ai/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/join-the-future-newsletter.png" alt="" width="1099" height="628" srcset="https://www.unite.ai/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/join-the-future-newsletter.png 1099w, https://www.unite.ai/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/join-the-future-newsletter-300x171.png 300w, https://www.unite.ai/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/join-the-future-newsletter-250x143.png 250w, https://www.unite.ai/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/join-the-future-newsletter-768x439.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1099px) 100vw, 1099px"> </a>  <a href="https://subscribe.unite.ai/"> <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.unite.ai/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Unite-AI-Mobile-Newsletter-1.png" alt="" width="1099" height="628"> </a></p></div></div>]]></description>

where we will be free," she said.</p><p>But Frankie Bontemps, a second generation Chagossian in the UK, told the BBC that he felt "betrayed" and "angry" at the news because "Chagossians have never been involved" in the negotiations.</p><p>"We remain powerless and voiceless in determining our own future", he said, and called for the full inclusion of Chagossians in drafting the treaty.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>In recent years, the UK has faced rising diplomatic isolation over its claim to what it refers to as the British Indian Ocean Territory, with <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-55848126">various United Nations bodies, including its top court and general assembly, overwhelmingly siding with Mauritius</a> and demanding the UK surrender what<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p08sfyf2"> some have called</a> its "last colony in Africa".</p><p>The government of Mauritius has long argued that it was illegally forced to give the Chagos Islands away in return for its own independence from the UK in 1968. </p><p>At the time, the British government had already negotiated a secret deal with the US, agreeing to lease it the largest atoll, Diego Garcia, for use as a military base.</p><p>Britain later apologised for forcibly removing more than 1,000 islanders from the entire archipelago and promised to hand the islands to Mauritius when they were no longer needed for strategic purposes.</p><p>But until very recently, the UK insisted that Mauritius itself had no legitimate claim to the islands.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>For decades, the tiny island nation of Mauritius struggled to win any serious international support on the issue.</p><p>A handful of Chagos islanders, who’d been forced to abandon their homes in the late 1960s and early 70s, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-36659976">repeatedly took the British government to court</a>.</p><p>But it was only recently that international opinion began to shift.</p><p>African nations began to speak with one voice on the issue, pushing the UK hard on the issue of decolonialisation. </p><p>Then Brexit left many European nations reluctant to continue backing the UK’s stance in international forums. </p><p>The Mauritian government went on the attack, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-45300739">accusing</a> the UK government of verbal threats.</p><p>And the Mauritians began to wage an increasingly sophisticated campaign – at the UN, in courts, and in the media – even <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-60349040">landing and planting a flag on the archipelago</a> without British authorisation.</p><p>The negotiations that brought about Thursday's deal began under the previous UK government.</p><p>But the timing of this breakthrough reflects a growing sense of urgency in international affairs, not least regarding Ukraine, with the UK keen to remove the Chagos issue as an obstacle to winning more global support, particularly from African nations, with the prospect of a second Trump presidency looming.</p><p>A backlash from some voices in the UK can be expected, even though successive Conservative and Labour prime ministers have been working towards the same broad goal.</p><p>Tory leadership candidate Tom Tugendhat argued the deal had been "negotiated against Britain's interest" and it was "disgraceful" that such talks had begun under the previous Conservative government.</p><p>He called it a "shameful retreat" that leaves "allies exposed", while the former foreign secretary James Cleverly called it a "weak" deal.</p><p>Human Rights Watch (HRW) said the deal will "address the wrongs against the Chagossians of the past but it looks like it will continue the crimes long into the future”.</p><p>There must be meaningful consultations with the Chagossians or the UK, US and now Mauritius will be responsible for "a still-ongoing colonial crime", Clive Baldwin, senior legal advisor at HRW said in a statement.</p><p>But there can be no doubting the historic significance of this moment.</p><p>Half a century or more after the UK relinquished control over almost all its global empire, it has finally agreed to hand over one of the very last pieces. It has done so reluctantly, perhaps, but also peacefully and legally.</p><p>The remaining British overseas territories are: Anguilla, Bermuda, British Antarctic Territory, British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Falkland Islands, Gibraltar, Montserrat, Pitcairn, Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, Turks and Caicos Islands. There are also two sovereign base areas on Cyprus under British jurisdiction.</p><p>Following the Chagos announcement, the governor of the Falklands said the islands are safe in British hands.</p><p>"The UK’s unwavering commitment to defend UK sovereignty [of the Falklands] remains undiminished", Alison Blake said in a <a href="https://x.com/GHFalklands/status/1841824267463193027">statement posted to social media<span>, <!-- -->external</span></a>.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p><strong>Increasing efforts against “radicalisation”</strong></p>
<p>The EU and its forerunners have targeted radicalism and “radicalisation” for <a href="https://www.tni.org/en/publication/the-globalisation-of-countering-violent-extremism-policies">decades</a>. This &nbsp;agenda gained a firmer hold <a href="https://www.statewatch.org/news/2013/july/eu-seeks-increased-surveillance-of-travel-and-social-media-to-deal-with-foreign-fighters/">in 2011</a>, when the European Commission established the Radicalisation Awareness Network.</p>
<p>In June this year, the Commission <a href="https://home-affairs.ec.europa.eu/policies/internal-security/counter-terrorism-and-radicalisation/prevention-radicalisation/eu-knowledge-hub-radicalisation-prevention-20_en">launched</a> a new <a rel="noopener" data-udi="umb://media/ac969f084247428a9b253f528940c845" href="https://www.statewatch.org/media/4525/eu-com-brochure-radicalisation-knowledge-hub-6-24.pdf" target="_blank" title="Eu Com Brochure Radicalisation Knowledge Hub 6 24">€60 million</a> (pdf) “Knowledge Hub” to further expand the agenda. The hub aims “to collaborate in a new way at the EU level to address the challenges posed by radicalisation.”</p>
<p>Around the same time, the Belgian Council presidency circulated a document (pdf) which “sums up the Presidency focus areas and initiatives for the past six months in the domain of counter-terrorism (CT)”. It says:</p>
<p><em>“</em><em>Member States should continue their efforts </em><em>to recognise and handle, at an early stage, public security threats stemming from individuals considered by national law enforcement authorities to constitute a violent extremist/terrorist threat.”</em></p>
<p>This would rely on information on these individuals being entered into EU databases, such as the Schengen Information System or Europol’s files. The document says information should be entered “where possible and in line with national and EU legislation.”</p>
<p><strong>Informal definition of “potential terrorist”</strong></p>
<p>These plans build upon a recent “shared understanding” of who EU authorities consider a "potential terrorist or violent extremist threat,” a concept encapsulated in the document by the German term <em>Gefährder</em>. The German authorities introduced the phrase and the topic of “potential terrorists” into EU institutions.</p>
<p>The Council’s internal security committee (COSI) approved this “shared understanding” <a rel="noopener" data-udi="umb://media/ab42a726c66147f8a70989d76791367a" href="https://www.statewatch.org/media/4527/eu-council-cosi-minutes-10752-24.pdf" target="_blank" title="Eu Council Cosi Minutes 10752 24">in May this year</a> (pdf).</p>
<p>By framing it as a “shared understanding”, COSI avoided legal reforms. This would have required lengthy negotiations, as well as an opportunity for democratic scrutiny.</p>
<p>The document that sets out <a rel="noopener" data-udi="umb://media/ab8ea0d926e64d4f9bbf3b2ea8d4aaf4" href="https://www.statewatch.org/media/4526/eu-council-gefahrder-shared-understanding-9988-24.pdf" target="_blank" title="Eu Council Gefahrder Shared Understanding 9988 24">the definition</a> (pdf) notes:</p>
<p><em>“The criteria are strictly <strong>non-binding</strong> and do not affect the existing mechanisms and procedures already established at European and national level. Their goal is to promote entering such individuals into the European databases and information systems by the Member States subject to the legal requirements governing these systems.” (emphasis in original)</em></p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.statewatch.org/news/2024/may/who-s-a-potential-terrorist-or-violent-extremist-threat-plans-to-exchange-information-about-future-criminals/">previously reported by <em>Statewatch</em></a>, the criteria consist of three points.</p>
<ol>
<li>A “minimum materiality threshold”. This requires “objective and verifiable… information suggesting that a criminal offence, or future criminal offence, has a certain degree of seriousness.”</li>
<li>A “basic indicative criterion”. This requires “objective, verifiable information” leading to a belief that the individual in question “will in the future commit, facilitate, support or engage in terrorist or violent extremist offences.”</li>
<li>A series of “indicative auxiliary criteria”. This could be involvement in terrorist offences, sharing terrorist content online, or being the subject of an EU entry ban.</li>
</ol>
<p>This Council initiative comes at the same time as the EU’s rollout of new information systems and an updated Europol mandate. These developments will massively expand the EU’s collection of information on “risky” individuals.</p>
<p>Through this “shared understanding”, the Council of the EU has created space for a new, informal practice. It will likely permit the collection and sharing of data on far more people than those involved in terrorism and violence.</p>
<p><strong>The effects on asylum-seekers and refugees</strong></p>
<p>The Belgian Presidency document outlines categories of people who this new practice may cover. These include asylum seekers and refugees, as well as climate and environmental activists.</p>
<p>The document notes the “limited” number of asylum seekers and refugees involved in terrorism and violence, but the new initiative adds to others that frame them as suspects.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.statewatch.org/news/2024/march/eu-intelligence-sharing-plan-extended-from-asylum-seekers-to-any-foreigner-involved-in-a-migratory-procedure/"><em>Statewatch</em> reported in March</a>, this includes an expanded intelligence-sharing plan introduced by the Belgian Presidency. This seeks to “strengthen cooperation and exchange of information between immigration and asylum authorities and between CT [counter-terrorism] authorities,” likely to be policing and intelligence agencies.</p>
<p>They justify this as a response to “terrorist attacks in Europe” that have “triggered a debate on how to better prevent future attacks.”</p>
<p><strong>The effects on climate and environmental activists</strong></p>
<p>The EU’s interest in “radicalisation” also targets climate and environmental activists. The recent Belgian Presidency document states:</p>
<p><em>“Climate activism is on the rise, together with an increased willingness to use violence, marking a shift from environmental activism to <strong>environmental extremism</strong>” (emphasis in original).</em></p>
<p>To back this up, the document refers to a report by the EU Counter-Terrorism Coordinator, which purportedly examined “the role climate change and environmental concerns play in the ideologies and narratives of violent extremists and terrorists in the EU.”</p>
<p>Yet, the report itself said it was largely speculative:</p>
<p><em>“The potential for terrorism and violent extremism linked to the environment and climate change is at this moment limited but might become more significant in the coming years.”</em></p>
<p>The Belgian Presidency document included a similar note on the “limited” number of asylum seekers and refugees involved in terrorism and violence. Yet, both groups remain targets of the EU’s agenda against “radicalisation”.</p>
<p>The UN Special Rapporteur on Environmental Defenders under the Aarhus Convention has <a href="https://www.statewatch.org/media/4190/un-unsr-environmental-protest-civil-disobedience-crackdowns-28-2-24.pdf">issued a warning</a> that:</p>
<p><em>“…the conflation of peaceful climate activism with radicalisation and terrorism may increase polarisation by wrongly labelling activists as radicals and trivialising terrorism.” </em></p>
<p>Harsh sentences are being handed down to peaceful climate protesters by both EU member states and the UK. The latter remains closely tied to the EU’s policing structures through its cooperation with Europol.</p>
<p>For example, at the end of August, <em>Climate Rights International</em> <a href="https://cri.org/reports/on-thin-ice/">reported</a>:</p>
<p><em>“…a German court sentenced 65-year-old Winfried Lorenz to 22 months in prison without parole, for his involvement in a climate protest that blocked a road. It is believed to be the longest sentence ever imposed in Berlin against a climate activist.”</em></p>

Now the intention is to cover not just asylum-seekers, but "any foreigner involved in a migratory procedure." According to the Belgian Presidency, "security concerns go beyond the mere scope of applicants for international protection, as they also cover other people who apply for the legal right to stay in Europe."</p>

<p>Binge-watching television, watching YouTube videos for hours, or scrolling on your phone every morning may seem harmless, but research shows that too much screen time may be detrimental to your health.</p>
<p>We know children’s brains are affected by spending too much time glued to their cell phones,&nbsp;however&nbsp;research shows that adult brains are also negatively impacted by excessive screen time, defined as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/educational/wecan/reduce-screen-time/index.htm">more than two hours</a>&nbsp;a day outside of work hours.</p>
<p>Too much screen time can impact our health in a myriad of ways, from eye strain and neck pain to social isolation and mental health, and in some cases, it may cause harm to our brains.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The negative effects of screen time are insidious because you can’t see what’s happening in your brain as you’re staring at the screen,” says Maris Loeffler, MA, Family and Marriage Therapist, member of the Stanford Lifestyle Medicine Cognitive Enhancement pillar. “If you scrolled on your phone in bed for an hour just one morning, the negative impacts would be minimal. But if it becomes a habit, day after day, month after month, this behavior can take a toll.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Since the eyes&nbsp;are directly connected&nbsp;to the brain, Loeffler encourages us to think about our eye health to ensure overall brain health. Rather than looking at our phones upon waking, Loeffler recommends starting each morning looking at the horizon or an object outside and far away.</p>
<p>To prevent eye strain throughout the workday,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aao.org/">The American Academy of Ophthalmology</a>&nbsp;recommends the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aao.org/eye-health/tips-prevention/computer-usage#:~:text=Take%20regular%20breaks%20using%20the,for%20at%20least%2020%20seconds.">20-20-20 rule</a>&nbsp;for adults who work on a computer. This rule suggests that individuals look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds every 20 minutes of the day.</p>
<h2>What is Happening in the Brain During Screen Time?</h2>
<p>This <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11469-019-00182-2">study</a> found that increased use of screens among adults may harm learning, memory, and mental health, as well as the potential to increase the risk of early neurodegeneration. The study shows that in adults aged 18 – 25, excessive screen time causes thinning of the cerebral cortex, the brain’s outermost layer responsible for processing memory and cognitive functions, such as decision-making and problem-solving.</p>
<p>Another&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1525861024002263">study</a> found that adults who watched television for five hours or more per day had an increased risk of developing brain-related disease like dementia, stroke, or Parkinson’s.</p>
<p>This&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9638701/">study</a>&nbsp;found that excessive screen time can hinder sleep, especially when looking at screens late at night. Light from the screen can delay melatonin release from the brain’s pineal gland, impacting the body’s natural circadian rhythm and causing difficulty sleeping.</p>
<p>Additional&nbsp;<a href="https://www.imrpress.com/journal/JIN/21/1/10.31083/j.jin2101028/htm">studies</a>&nbsp;found that adults who engage in excessive screen time or have a diagnosed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0306460319313802#b0080">smartphone addiction</a>&nbsp;had lower&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK553239/#:~:text=%5B1%5D%20Grey%20matter%20makes%20up,concentration%20of%20neuronal%20cell%20bodies.">gray matter</a>&nbsp;volume. Gray matter is brain tissue essential for daily human functioning and is responsible for everything from movement to memory to emotions.&nbsp;Gray matter volume naturally decreases as we age, so along with reducing screen time, engaging in activities that maintain our gray matter volume and promote brain health, such as exercise and movement, restorative sleep, social engagement, and stress management, is crucial.</p>
<p>“Passive screen time is like eating sugar but for your brain.&nbsp;It&nbsp;‘tastes’&nbsp;good, and you want it now, but you’re not&nbsp;actually&nbsp;feeding yourself.&nbsp;You’re not giving your brain any nutrition,” says Loeffler. “Instead, replace screen time with an intentional healthy habit that&nbsp;feeds your brain in a healthy way. Lifestyle medicine activities, like exercise, good sleep, social connection, and stress management, function like ‘nutrition’ for your brain and mental health.”</p>
<p>Specifically, Loeffler cautions us not to pick up the phone after the alarm goes off in the morning. She explains that looking at our email or social media on our phones while still in bed jolts the nervous system and can trigger the fight-or-flight response since we aren’t fully awake yet.</p>
<p>Also, if we look at our&nbsp;phones&nbsp;first thing&nbsp;every&nbsp;morning, we create a pattern and can set the flight-or-flight response as our default mode of operation. So, not only does this behavior set an anxiety-filled tone for the day, but&nbsp;we are also training our brains to be more hypervigilant in general.</p>
<p><strong>“One of the biggest issues with picking up the phone right away in the morning is that when you have an object close to your face, it’s registered as a threat,” says Loeffler. “You wouldn’t want to wake up and look a bear in the face every morning. On a physiological level, it’s the same thing.”</strong></p>
<h2>Practice of the Month: No Screen Time for the First Hour of the Day</h2>
<p>Stanford Lifestyle Medicine experts recommend no screen time for the first hour of the day to support cognitive enhancement. Instead, we suggest engaging in a lifestyle medicine activity upon waking to promote whole-body health:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exercise</li>
<li>Call a friend or family member</li>
<li>Prepare a healthy <a href="https://longevity.stanford.edu/lifestyle/2024/04/08/dr-spencers-science-based-smoothie-for-gut-health/">breakfast</a></li>
<li>Meditate and count your&nbsp;<a href="https://longevity.stanford.edu/lifestyle/2023/11/14/optimism-as-a-means-to-a-longer-life/">blessings</a></li>
<li>Listen to music</li>
<li>Create a&nbsp;<a href="https://longevity.stanford.edu/lifestyle/2023/11/14/gratitude-is-good-medicine/">gratitude</a>&nbsp;list</li>
<li>Read a book</li>
<li>Spend time outside and get&nbsp;<a href="https://longevity.stanford.edu/lifestyle/2024/03/11/vitamin-d-benefits-sources-deficiency/">morning light</a></li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>“How do you want your day’s energy and mood to start?” says Loeffler. “Intentionally implementing a morning routine that reflects lifestyle medicine choices instead of screen time sets a positive tone for the day and supports brain health and cognitive enhancement.”</p></blockquote>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2024/10/01/terminal-colours/">https://jvns.ca/blog/2024/10/01/terminal-colours/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41727971">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
     

<p>Yesterday I was thinking about how long it took me to get a colorscheme in my
terminal that I was mostly happy with (SO MANY YEARS), and it made me wonder
what about terminal colours made it so hard.</p>

<p>So I <a href="https://social.jvns.ca/@b0rk/113226972156366201">asked people on Mastodon</a> what problems
they’ve run into with colours in the terminal, and I got a ton of interesting
responses! Let’s talk about some of the problems and a few possible ways to fix
them.</p>

<h3 id="problem-1-blue-on-black">problem 1: blue on black</h3>

<p>One of the top complaints was “blue on black is hard to read”. Here’s an
example of that: if I open Terminal.app, set the background to black, and run
<code>ls</code>, the directories are displayed in a blue that isn’t that easy to read:</p>

<p><img src="https://jvns.ca/images/terminal-blue.png"></p>

<p>To understand why we’re seeing this blue, let’s talk about ANSI colours!</p>

<h3 id="the-16-ansi-colours">the 16 ANSI colours</h3>

<p>Your terminal has 16 numbered colours – black, red, green, yellow, blue,
magenta, cyan, white, and “bright” version of each of those.</p>

<p>Programs can use them by printing out an “ANSI escape code” – for example if
you want to see each of the 16 colours in your terminal, you can run this
Python program:</p>

<pre><code>def color(num, text):
    return f"\033[38;5;{num}m{text}\033[0m"

for i in range(16):
    print(color(i, f"number {i:02}"))

<h3 id="what-are-the-ansi-colours">what are the ANSI colours?</h3>

<p>This made me wonder – if blue is colour number 5, who decides what hex color
that should correspond to?</p>

<p>The answer seems to be “there’s no standard, terminal emulators just choose
colours and it’s not very consistent”. Here’s a <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#Colors">screenshot of a table from Wikipedia</a>, where you
can see that there’s a lot of variation:</p>

<p><img src="https://jvns.ca/images/wikipedia.png"></p>

<h3 id="problem-1-5-bright-yellow-on-white">problem 1.5: bright yellow on white</h3>

<p>Bright yellow on white is even worse than blue on black, here’s what I get in
a terminal with the default settings:</p>

<p><img src="https://jvns.ca/images/terminal-yellow.png"></p>

<p>That’s almost impossible to read (and some other colours like light green cause
similar issues), so let’s talk about solutions!</p>

<h3 id="two-ways-to-reconfigure-your-colours">two ways to reconfigure your colours</h3>

<p>If you’re annoyed by these colour contrast issues (or maybe you just think the
default ANSI colours are ugly), you might think – well, I’ll just choose a
different “blue” and pick something I like better!</p>

<p>There are two ways you can do this:</p>

<p><strong>Way 1: Configure your terminal emulator</strong>: I think most modern terminal emulators
   have a way to reconfigure the colours, and some of them even come with some
   preinstalled themes that you might like better than the defaults.</p>

<p><strong>Way 2: Run a shell script</strong>: There are ANSI escape codes that you can print
out to tell your terminal emulator to reconfigure its colours. <a href="https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-shell/blob/master/scripts/base16-solarized-light.sh">Here’s a shell script that does that</a>,
from the <a href="https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-shell">base16-shell</a> project.
You can see that it has a few different conventions for changing the colours –
I guess different terminal emulators have different escape codes for changing
their colour palette, and so the script is trying to pick the right style of
escape code based on the <code>TERM</code> environment variable.</p>

<h3 id="what-are-the-pros-and-cons-of-the-2-ways-of-configuring-your-colours">what are the pros and cons of the 2 ways of configuring your colours?</h3>

<p>I prefer to use the “shell script” method, because:</p>

<ul>
<li>if I switch terminal emulators for some reason, I don’t need to a different configuration system, my colours still Just Work</li>
<li>I use <a href="https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-shell">base16-shell</a> with base16-vim to make my vim colours match my terminal colours, which is convenient</li>
</ul>

<p>The main advantage I can think of for configuring colours in your terminal
emulator is that, if you use a popular terminal emulator, there are probably a
lot of nice terminal themes out there that you can choose from. I think there are some more advantages I’m not thinking of though.</p>

<p>This is what my shell has looked like for probably the last 5 years (using the
solarized light base16 theme), and I’m pretty happy with it. Here’s <code>htop</code>:</p>

<p><img src="https://jvns.ca/images/terminal-my-colours.png"></p>

<p>Okay, so let’s say you’ve found a terminal colorscheme that you like. What else
can go wrong?</p>

<h3 id="problem-2-programs-using-256-colours">problem 2: programs using 256 colours</h3>

<p>Here’s what some output of <code>fd</code>, a <code>find</code> alternative, looks like in my
colorscheme:</p>

<p><img src="https://jvns.ca/images/terminal-problem-fd.png"></p>

<p>The contrast is pretty bad here, and I definitely don’t have that lime green in
my normal colorscheme. What’s going on?</p>

<p>We can see what color codes <code>fd</code> is using using the <code>unbuffer</code> program to
capture its output including the color codes:</p>

<pre><code>$ unbuffer fd . &gt; out
$ vim out
[38;5;48mbad-again.sh[0m
[38;5;48mbad.sh[0m
[38;5;48mbetter.sh[0m
out
</code></pre>

<p><code>[38;5;48</code> means “set the foreground color to color <code>48</code>”. Terminals don’t
only have 16 colours – many terminals these days actually have 3 ways of
specifying colours:</p>

<ol>
<li>the 16 ANSI colours we already talked about</li>
<li>an extended set of 256 colours</li>
<li>a further extended set of 24-bit hex colours, like <code>#ffea03</code></li>
</ol>

<p>So <code>fd</code> is using one of the colours from the extended 256-color set. <code>bat</code> (a
<code>cat</code> alternative) does something similar – here’s what it looks like by
default in my terminal.</p>

<p><img src="https://jvns.ca/images/terminal-bat.png"></p>

<p>This looks fine though and it really seems like it’s trying to work well with a
variety of terminal themes.</p>

<h3 id="some-newer-tools-seem-to-have-theme-support">some newer tools seem to have theme support</h3>

<p>I think it’s interesting that some of these newer terminal tools (<code>fd</code>, <code>cat</code>,
<code>delta</code>, and probably more) have support for arbitrary custom themes. I guess
the downside of this approach is that the default theme might clash with your
terminal’s background, but the upside is that it gives you a lot more control
over theming the tool’s output than just choosing 16 ANSI colours.</p>

<p>I don’t really use <code>bat</code>, but if I did I’d probably use <code>bat --theme ansi</code> to
just use the ANSI colours that I have set in my normal terminal colorscheme.</p>

<h3 id="problem-3-the-grays-in-solarized">problem 3: the grays in Solarized</h3>

<p>A bunch of people on Mastodon mentioned a specific issue with grays in the
Solarized theme: when I list a directory, the base16 Solarized Light theme
looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://jvns.ca/images/terminal-solarized-base16.png"></p>

<p>but iTerm’s default Solarized Light theme looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://jvns.ca/images/terminal-solarized-iterm.png"></p>

<p>This is because in the iTerm theme (which is the <a href="https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/#the-values">original Solarized design</a>), colors 9-14 (the “bright blue”, “bright
red”, etc) are mapped to a series of grays, and when I run <code>ls</code>, it’s trying to
use those “bright” colours to color my directories and executables.</p>

<p>My best guess for why the original Solarized theme is designed this way is to
make the grays available to the <a href="https://github.com/altercation/vim-colors-solarized/blob/528a59f26d12278698bb946f8fb82a63711eec21/colors/solarized.vim">vim Solarized colorscheme</a>.</p>

<p>I’m pretty sure I prefer the modified base16 version I use where the “bright”
colours are actually colours instead of all being shades of gray though. (I
didn’t actually realize the version I was using wasn’t the “original” Solarized
theme until I wrote this post)</p>

<h3 id="problem-4-a-vim-theme-that-doesn-t-match-the-terminal-background">problem 4: a vim theme that doesn’t match the terminal background</h3>

<p>If I my vim theme has a different background colour than my terminal theme, I
get this ugly border, like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://jvns.ca/images/terminal-vim-black-bg.png"></p>

<p>This one is a pretty minor issue though and I think making your terminal
background match your vim background is pretty straightforward.</p>

<h3 id="problem-5-programs-setting-a-background-color">problem 5: programs setting a background color</h3>

<p>A few people mentioned problems with terminal applications setting an
unwanted background colour, so let’s look at an example of that.</p>

<p>Here <code>ngrok</code> has set the background to color #16 (“black”), but the
<code>base16-shell</code> script I use sets color 16 to be bright orange, so I get this,
which is pretty bad:</p>

<p><img src="https://jvns.ca/images/terminal-ngrok-solarized.png"></p>

<p>I think the intention is for ngrok to look something like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://jvns.ca/images/terminal-ngrok-regular.png"></p>

<p>I think <code>base16-shell</code> sets color #16 to orange (instead of black)
so that it can provide extra colours for use by <a href="https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-vim/blob/3be3cd82cd31acfcab9a41bad853d9c68d30478d/colors/base16-solarized-light.vim">base16-vim</a>.
This feels reasonable to me – I use <code>base16-vim</code> in the terminal, so I guess I’m
using that feature and it’s probably more important to me than <code>ngrok</code> (which I
rarely use) behaving a bit weirdly.</p>

<p>This particular issue is a maybe obscure clash between ngrok and my colorschem,
but I think this kind of clash is pretty common when a program sets an ANSI
background color that the user has remapped for some reason.</p>

<h3 id="a-nice-solution-to-contrast-issues-minimum-contrast">a nice solution to contrast issues: “minimum contrast”</h3>

<p>A bunch of terminals (iTerm2, <a href="https://github.com/Eugeny/tabby">tabby</a>, kitty’s <a href="https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/conf/#opt-kitty.text_fg_override_threshold">text_fg_override_threshold</a>, and
folks tell me also Ghostty and Windows Terminal) have a “minimum
contrast” feature that will automatically adjust colours to make sure they have enough contrast.</p>

<p>Here’s an example from iTerm. This ngrok accident from before has pretty bad
contrast, I find it pretty difficult to read:</p>

<p><img src="https://jvns.ca/images/terminal-ngrok-solarized.png"></p>

<p>With “minimum contrast” set to 40 in iTerm, it looks like this instead:</p>

<p><img src="https://jvns.ca/images/terminal-ngrok-solarized-contrast.png"></p>

<p>I didn’t have minimum contrast turned on before but I just turned it on today
because it makes such a big difference when something goes wrong with colours
in the terminal.</p>

<h3 id="problem-6-term-being-set-to-the-wrong-thing">problem 6: <code>TERM</code> being set to the wrong thing</h3>

<p>A few people mentioned that they’ll SSH into a system that doesn’t support the
<code>TERM</code> environment variable that they have set locally, and then the colours
won’t work.</p>

<p>I think the way <code>TERM</code> works is that systems have a <code>terminfo</code> database, so if
the value of the <code>TERM</code> environment variable isn’t in the system’s terminfo
database, then it won’t know how to output colours for that terminal. I don’t
know too much about terminfo, but someone linked me to this <a href="https://twoot.site/@bean/113056942625234032">terminfo rant</a> that talks about a few other
issues with terminfo.</p>

<p>I don’t have a system on hand to reproduce this one so I can’t say for sure how
to fix it, but <a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/67537/prevent-ssh-client-passing-term-environment-variable-to-server">this stackoverflow question</a>
suggests running something like <code>TERM=xterm ssh</code> instead of <code>ssh</code>.</p>

<h3 id="problem-7-picking-good-colours-is-hard">problem 7: picking “good” colours is hard</h3>

<p>A couple of problems people mentioned with designing / finding terminal colorschemes:</p>

<ul>
<li>some folks are colorblind and have trouble finding an appropriate colorscheme</li>
<li>accidentally making the background color too close to the cursor or selection color, so they’re hard to find</li>
<li>generally finding colours that work with every program is a struggle (for example you can see me having a problem with this with ngrok above!)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="problem-8-making-nethack-mc-look-right">problem 8: making nethack/mc look right</h3>

<p>Another problem people mentioned is using a program like nethack or midnight
commander which you might expect to have a specific colourscheme based on the
default ANSI terminal colours.</p>

<p>For example, midnight commander has a really specific classic look:</p>

<p><img src="https://jvns.ca/images/terminal-mc-normal.png"></p>

<p>But in my Solarized theme, midnight commander looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://jvns.ca/images/terminal-mc-solarized.png"></p>

<p>The Solarized version feels like it could be disorienting if you’re
very used to the “classic” look.</p>

<p>One solution Simon Tatham mentioned to this is using some palette customization
ANSI codes (like the ones base16 uses that I talked about earlier) to change
the color palette right before starting the program, for example remapping
yellow to a brighter yellow before starting Nethack so that the yellow
characters look better.</p>

<h3 id="problem-9-commands-disabling-colours-when-writing-to-a-pipe">problem 9: commands disabling colours when writing to a pipe</h3>

<p>If I run <code>fd | less</code>, I see something like this, with the colours disabled.</p>

<p><img src="https://jvns.ca/images/terminal-fd-bw.png"></p>

<p>In generan I find this useful – if I pipe a command to <code>grep</code>, I don’t want it
to print out all those color escape codes, I just want the plain text. But what if you want to see the colours?</p>

<p>To see the colours, you can run <code>unbuffer fd | less -r</code>! I just learned about
<code>unbuffer</code> recently and I think it’s really cool, <code>unbuffer</code> opens a tty for the
command to write to so that it thinks it’s writing to a TTY. It also fixes
issues with programs buffering their output when writing to a pipe, which is
why it’s called <code>unbuffer</code>.</p>

<p>Here’s what the output of <code>unbuffer fd | less -r</code> looks like for me:</p>

<p><img src="https://jvns.ca/images/terminal-fd-color.png"></p>

<h3 id="problem-10-unwanted-colour-in-ls-and-other-commands">problem 10: unwanted colour in <code>ls</code> and other commands</h3>

<p>Some people mentioned that they don’t want <code>ls</code> to use colour at all, perhaps
because <code>ls</code> uses blue, it’s hard to read on black, and maybe they don’t feel like
customizing their terminal’s colourscheme to make the blue more readable or
just don’t find the use of colour helpful.</p>

<p>Some possible solutions to this one:</p>

<ul>
<li>you can run <code>ls --color=never</code>, which is probably easiest</li>
<li>you can also set <code>LS_COLORS</code> to customize the colours used by <code>ls</code>. I think some other programs other than <code>ls</code> support the <code>LS_COLORS</code> environment variable too.</li>
<li>also some programs support setting <code>NO_COLOR=true</code> (there’s a <a href="https://no-color.org/">list here</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Here’s an example of running <code>LS_COLORS="fi=0:di=0:ln=0:pi=0:so=0:bd=0:cd=0:or=0:ex=0" ls</code>:</p>

<p><img src="https://jvns.ca/images/terminal-ls-colors.png"></p>

<h3 id="problem-11-the-colours-in-vim">problem 11: the colours in vim</h3>

<p>I used to have a lot of problems with configuring my colours in vim – I’d set
up my terminal colours in a way that I thought was okay, and then I’d start vim
and it would just be a disaster.</p>

<p>I think what was going on here is that today, there are two ways to set up a vim colorscheme in the terminal:</p>

<ol>
<li>using your ANSI terminal colours – you tell vim which ANSI colour number to use for the background, for functions, etc.</li>
<li>using 24-bit hex colours – instead of ANSI terminal colours, the vim colorscheme can use hex codes like #faea99 directly</li>
</ol>

<p>20 years ago when I started using vim, terminals with 24-bit hex color support
were a lot less common (or maybe they didn’t exist at all), and vim certainly
didn’t have support for using 24-bit colour in the terminal. From some quick
searching through git, it looks like <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim/commit/8a633e3427b47286869aa4b96f2bfc1fe65b25cd">vim added support for 24-bit colour in 2016</a>
– just 8 years ago!</p>

<p>So to get colours to work properly in vim before 2016, you needed to synchronize
your terminal colorscheme and your vim colorscheme. <a href="https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-vim/blob/3be3cd82cd31acfcab9a41bad853d9c68d30478d/colors/base16-solarized-light.vim#L52-L71">Here’s what that looked like</a>,
the colorscheme needed to map the vim color classes like <code>cterm05</code> to ANSI colour numbers.</p>

<p>But in 2024, the story is really different! Vim (and Neovim, which I use now)
support 24-bit colours, and as of Neovim 0.10 (released in May 2024), the
<code>termguicolors</code> setting (which tells Vim to use 24-bit hex colours for
colorschemes) is <a href="https://neovim.io/doc/user/news-0.10.html">turned on by default</a> in any terminal with 24-bit
color support.</p>

<p>So this “you need to synchronize your terminal colorscheme and your vim
colorscheme” problem is not an issue anymore for me in 2024, since I
don’t plan to use terminals without 24-bit color support in the future.</p>

<p>The biggest consequence for me of this whole thing is that I don’t need base16
to set colors 16-21 to weird stuff anymore to integrate with vim – I can just
use a terminal theme and a vim theme, and as long as the two themes use similar
colours (so it’s not jarring for me to switch between them) there’s no problem.
I think I can just remove those parts from my <code>base16</code> shell script and totally
avoid the problem with ngrok and the weird orange background I talked about
above.</p>

<h3 id="some-more-problems-i-left-out">some more problems I left out</h3>

<p>I think there are a lot of issues around the intersection of multiple programs,
like using some combination tmux/ssh/vim that I couldn’t figure out how to
reproduce well enough to talk about them. Also I’m sure I missed a lot of other
things too.</p>

<h3 id="okay-that-was-a-lot">okay, that was a lot</h3>

<p>We talked about a lot in this post and  while I think learning about all these
details is kind of fun if I’m in the mood to do a deep dive, I find it SO
FRUSTRATING to deal with it when I just want my colours to work! Being
surprised by unreadable text and having to find a workaround is just not my
idea of a good day.</p>

<p>Personally I’m a zero-configuration kind of person and it’s not that appealing
to me to have to put together a lot of custom configuration just to make my
colours in the terminal look acceptable. I’d much rather just have some
reasonable defaults that I don’t have to change.</p>

<h3 id="base16-has-really-worked-for-me">base16 has really worked for me</h3>

<p>I’ve personally had a lot of success with using
<a href="https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-shell">base16-shell</a> with
<a href="https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-vim">base16-vim</a> – I just need to add <a href="https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-shell?tab=readme-ov-file#fish">a couple of lines</a> to my
fish config to set it up (+ a few <code>.vimrc</code> lines) and then I can move on and
accept any remaining problems that that doesn’t solve.</p>

<p>I don’t think base16 is for everyone though, some limitations I’m aware
of with base16 that might make it not work for you:</p>

<ul>
<li>it comes with a limited set of builtin themes and you might not like any of them</li>
<li>the Solarized base16 theme (and maybe all of the themes?) sets the “bright”
ANSI colours to be exactly the same as the normal colours, which might cause
a problem if you’re relying on the “bright” colours to be different from the
regular ones</li>
<li>it sets colours 16-21 in order to give the vim colorschemes from <code>base16-vim</code>
access to more colours, which might not be relevant if you always use a
terminal with 24-bit color support, and can cause problems like the ngrok
issue above</li>
<li>also the way it sets colours 16-21 could be a problem in terminals that don’t have
256-color support</li>
</ul>

<p>Apparently there’s a community fork of base16 called
<a href="https://github.com/tinted-theming/home">tinted-theming</a>, which I haven’t
looked into much yet.</p>

<h3 id="some-other-colorscheme-tools">some other colorscheme tools</h3>

<p>Just one so far but I’ll link more if people tell me about them:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://rootloops.sh/">rootloops.sh</a> for generating colorschemes (and <a href="https://hamvocke.com/blog/lets-create-a-terminal-color-scheme/">“let’s create a terminal color scheme”</a>)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="minimum-contrast-seems-like-an-amazing-feature">minimum contrast seems like an amazing feature</h3>

<p>My one big takeaway from writing this was to turn on “minimum contrast” in my
terminal, I think it’s going to fix most of the occasional accidental
unreadable text issues I run into and I’m pretty excited about it.</p>

It was in 2013, when Android was still the underdog compared to the iPhone, and was being touted as a great platform for developers. I’d taken two weeks to build <a href="https://frozenfractal.com/games/patchy/">Patchy</a>, a retro arcade game revamped for touch controls, and published it on the Google Play Store without any hassle. Since then, I’ve also published <a href="https://frozenfractal.com/games/twistago/">Twistago</a>, <a href="https://frozenfractal.com/games/rocket-mail/">Rocket Mail</a>, <a href="https://frozenfractal.com/blog/2015/6/14/bigcanvas-released/">Bigcanvas</a>, <a href="https://frozenfractal.com/projects/radio-nul/">Radio Nul</a> and <a href="https://frozenfractal.com/projects/papageno/">Papageno</a>.</p><p>With each next app, the bar for publishing kept getting higher. At some point, Google started publishing developers’ full company address on the store alongside the app. That’s fine for a professional company, but quite problematic for a solo indie developer who works from home, especially if the app <em>or the developer</em> is even remotely controversial. I worked around it at the time by just putting the name of the town instead of the full address, which is only right morally, but not legally.</p><p>The technical requirements also kept going up. To publish an update to an app, it has to target the latest API version, which goes up once or twice a year. Each API update comes with a slew of deprecations, and breaking changes to the already inscrutable build system. And even if you don’t want to update the app, Google will eventually start hiding apps from users if the app doesn’t target some minimum API version. This means you can’t just publish an app and leave it at that; it’s several days of work per app per year to keep up with the latest rug-pulls from Google. Again this is no problem for a company for whom the app is their core business, but bad news for indie and hobbyist developers who just want to make something cool, put it out there, and move on to the next project.</p><p>And then, there’s the latest increase in publishing requirements, the straw that broke the camel’s back, which made me decide to abandon the Google Play Store altogether.</p><h2 id="the-new-rules">The new rules</h2><p>The <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2023/07/boosting-trust-and-transparency-in-google-play.html">original announcement</a> just mentioned that organizations will need to provide a D-U-N-S number. It was possible to choose your own deadline, so I set it as far in the future as I could. Now that deadline, 5 November, is getting close, and I can start the verification process. The email, however, makes it clear that they want much more than a D-U-N-S number:</p><blockquote><p><strong>What you need to provide to verify</strong></p><ul><li>a D-U-N-S number for your organization<br>If you don’t have a D-U-N-S number, request one at no cost from Dun &amp; Bradstreet now.

Dun &amp; Bradstreet’s partner in the Netherlands, <a href="https://www.altares.nl/en/our-data/duns-number/">Altares</a>, does allow me to look up my own company, but charges 15 € for the privilege of seeing my own data, <em>including my own D-U-N-S number</em>, which they’ve apparently already assigned when I registered with the Chamber of Commerce. If I didn’t already have one, I don’t see a way on their website to request one either, even though the FAQ mentions that you can (for a fee, of course).</p><p>While that may be just some paperwork and a small expense, the next requirement is more insidious: “a phone number and email address for Google Play users to contact you”. I’m fine showing an email address, but I <em>absolutely do not want</em> my phone number to be available to anyone on the internet. (Even for phone calls. But remember that a phone number is used for much more than phone calls these days.) And that’s just me, a privileged hetero white cis dude who is unlikely to be the target of harassment or doxxing.</p><p>The requirement “a phone number and email address for Google to contact you” is the only one that sounds benign to me, although I have yet to see Google trying to contact small-fry developers like me by phone, instead of just reaching for the algorithmic ban hammer if I cross any line.</p><p>An “official document to verify your identity” would presumably be a scan or photo of my passport. Now, I have reasonable confidence in the security of Google’s systems, but this is something very sensitive and can easily be abused if it fell into the wrong hands. And why is it necessary? I’ve done business with many other companies, where a lot more money was changing hands than I’m getting from my Play Store apps, but they never asked for my passport. Why does Google?</p><p>Those other companies also never asked for “an official document to verify your organization”. Presumably this is a document I can request from the Chamber of Commerce to the tune of another 9 €, but again I’ve never had another company ask for this when doing business with them.</p><h2 id="in-conclusion">In conclusion</h2><p>I sort of understand why Google is doing all this. It’s partly legal requirements (especially EU), partly an attempt to reduce spam and malicious stuff. Some of it might even be in the best interest of the end user.</p><p>Larger companies have the resources to deal with all this, and for personal accounts the <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/13628312">rules</a> are much more lenient. Sadly, there has been little consideration for sole proprietorships like mine, which fall somewhere in between: bound by the same rules as big companies, but without the means to play by them.</p><p>And this is why I’m just going to let my Play Store developer account expire. Starting on 5 November, you won’t be able to install any of my apps anymore. Most of them were not actively maintained anymore, <em>but they still worked</em>, because the Android operating system itself is actually pretty good at backwards compatibility.</p><p>Even though there was little remaining interest in my older apps, it makes me sad that people won’t be able to use them anymore. The one I’m most sad about, though, is <a href="https://papageno.app/">Papageno</a>, an unfinished side project about bird sounds that I haven’t worked on for three years, but keeps popping into my mind as something I’d really like to finish some day. Maybe it could be in the form of a web app. We’ll see.</p><p><img src="https://frozenfractal.com/blog/2024/9/6/why-my-apps-will-soon-be-gone-from-google-play/no_more_google_play.png" alt="The official “Get it on Google Play” button, but with the text “You can no longer” scribbled above it, probably flying in the face of official brand guidelines"></p></div></div>]]></description>

    </div><p>In the 1990s, NASA satellites built to spot high-energy particles coming from supernovae and other celestial-sized objects discovered a surprise—high energy gamma radiation bursts coming from right here on Earth.</p>


										      
																																	<p>While it didn't take long for researchers to determine that these high-energy gamma rays were originating from thunderstorms, how commonly the phenomenon happened remained a mystery. Satellites weren't built to find <a href="https://phys.org/tags/gamma+radiation/" rel="tag">gamma radiation</a> coming from Earth, and they had to be in just the right place at just the right time to do so.</p>
<p>After years of making do with platforms not ideal for the task, a group of scientists secured an opportunity to fly a retrofitted U2 <a href="https://phys.org/tags/spy+plane/" rel="tag">spy plane</a> owned by NASA over storms to take a proper look. In two new papers <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07893-0" target="_blank">published</a> in <i>Nature</i>, the team discovered that gamma radiation produced in thunderstorms is far more common than anyone thought and that the dynamics creating the radiation hold a treasure trove of mysteries yet to be solved.</p>
<p>"There is way more going on in thunderstorms than we ever imagined," said Steve Cummer, the William H. Younger Distinguished Professor of Engineering at Duke University, who was a co-author on both papers. "As it turns out, essentially all big thunderstorms generate gamma rays all day long in many different forms."</p>
<p>The general physics behind how thunderstorms create high-energy flashes of gamma radiation is not a mystery. As thunderstorms develop, swirling drafts drive <a href="https://phys.org/tags/water+droplets/" rel="tag">water droplets</a>, hail and ice into a mixture that creates an <a href="https://phys.org/tags/electric+charge/" rel="tag">electric charge</a> much like rubbing a balloon on your shirt.</p>

																																						
																																			<p>Positively charged particles end up at the top of the storm while negatively charged particles drop to the bottom, creating an enormous electric field that can be as strong as 100 million AA batteries stacked end-to-end.</p>
<p>When other charged particles—such as electrons—find themselves in such a strong field, they accelerate. If they accelerate to high enough speeds and happen to strike an air molecule, they knock off more high-energy electrons. The process cascades until the collisions have enough energy to create <a href="https://phys.org/tags/nuclear+reactions/" rel="tag">nuclear reactions</a>, producing extremely strong and extremely fast flashes of gamma rays, antimatter and other forms of radiation.</p>
<p>But that's not the end of the thunderstorm gamma radiation story. Aircraft flying close to thunderstorms have also seen a faint glow of gamma radiation coming from clouds. These storms seem to have enough energy to produce a low-level simmering of gamma radiation, but something prevents it from creating an explosive burst like a popping corn kernel.</p>
<p>"A few aircraft campaigns tried to figure out if these phenomena were common or not, but there were mixed results, and several campaigns over the United States didn't find any gamma radiation at all," Cummer said. "This project was designed to address these questions once and for all."</p>
<p>The research group secured the use of a NASA ER-2 High-Altitude Airborne Science Aircraft. A retrofitted U2 spy plane left over from the Cold War, it flies over twice as high as <a href="https://phys.org/tags/commercial+aircraft/" rel="tag">commercial aircraft</a> and about three miles above most thunderstorms. It's also extremely fast, giving the team the opportunity to pick the exact thunderstorms they thought were most likely to produce results.</p>

																																			<p>"The ER-2 aircraft would be the ultimate observing platform for <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07936-6" target="_blank">gamma-rays from thunderclouds</a>," said Nikolai Østgaard, professor of space physics at the University of Bergen in Norway and lead investigator of the project. "Flying at 20 km [12.4 miles], we can fly directly over the cloud top, as close as possible to the gamma-ray source."</p>
<p>Because the ER-2 was the perfect solution and the team was going to fly over the right storms, the researchers figured that if these phenomena were rare, then they'd barely see any at all. But if they were common, then they'd see a lot.</p>
<p>And they saw a lot.</p>
<p>Over the course of a month, the ER-2 flew 10 flights over large storms in the tropics south of Florida, and nine of them yielded observations of this summer of gamma radiation, which was also more dynamic than expected.</p>
<p>"The dynamics of gamma-glowing thunderclouds starkly contradicts the former quasi-stationary picture of glows, and rather resembles that of a huge gamma-glowing boiling pot both in pattern and behavior," said Martino Marisaldi, professor of physics and technology at the University of Bergen.</p>
<p>Given the size of a typical thunderstorm in the tropics, which is much larger than storms at other latitudes, this suggests that more than half of all thunderstorms in the tropics are radioactive. The researchers postulate that this low-level production of gamma radiation acts like steam boiling off a pot of water and limits how much energy can be built up inside.</p>

																																						
																																			<p>The researchers were equally excited to see numerous examples of short duration and intense gamma radiation bursts coming from the same thunderstorms. Some of these were precisely like those that were originally detected by NASA satellites. These almost always occurred in conjunction with an active lightning discharge.</p>
<p>This suggests that the large electric field created by lightning is likely supercharging the already high-energy electrons, enabling them to create high-energy nuclear reactions.</p>
<p>But there were also at least two other types of short gamma radiation bursts that had never been seen before. One type is incredibly short, less than a thousandth of a second, while the other is a sequence of about 10 individual bursts that repeat over the course of about a tenth of a second.</p>
<p>"Those two new forms of gamma radiation are what I find most interesting," Cummer said. "They don't seem to be associated with developing lightning flashes. They emerge spontaneously somehow. There are hints in the data that they may actually be linked to the processes that initiate lightning flashes, which are still a mystery to scientists."</p>
<p>If there is anybody out there worried about getting turned into the Hulk by all of this gamma radiation, Cummer added, they shouldn't be. The amount of radiation being produced would only be dangerous if a person or object were quite close to the origination source.</p>
<p>"The radiation would be the least of your problems if you found yourself there. Airplanes avoid flying in active <a href="https://phys.org/tags/thunderstorm/" rel="tag">thunderstorm</a> cores due to the extreme turbulence and winds," Cummer said. "Even knowing what we now know, I don't worry about flying any more than I used to."</p>

This would represent a growth rate of 225% y/y from $1.6B at the end of last year. OpenAI also further projects to get to $11.6B in revenue in 2025, an increase of 213% y/y next year if they are able to achieve it.</span></p><p><strong>Revenue Breakdown: </strong><span>The split of OpenAI’s revenue, per company projections for the end of 2024 is roughly:</span></p><ul><li><p><strong>ChatGPT subscriptions</strong><span>: $2.7B (~73%) representing 285% y/y growth</span></p><ul><li><p>This includes about 10M subscribers on the ChatGPT plus plan and another 1M on higher priced plans</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>API</strong><span>: $1B (~27%) representing 200-225% y/y growth</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>Margins: </strong><span>We don’t know much about OpenAI’s margins, but given reports that they are expected to </span><strong>lose about $5B this year</strong><span> on about $3.7B of revenue which is obviously not great. Futuresearch estimates that their API business actually has ~50% gross margins, and that most of the losses come from operating costs (R&amp;D, etc) and their ChatGPT business, which gives basically unlimited usage for ~$20/month.</span></p><p><strong>Revenue: </strong><span>Anthropic is expected to be at $1B annualized run rate revenue at the end of this year, about a 900% increase from the ~$100M or so in annualized run rate revenue they were generating at the end of 2023.</span></p><p><strong>Revenue Breakdown</strong><span>: Anthropic’s revenue breakdown skews much more towards its API, particularly through it’s 3P API which is largely via Amazon. Their breakdown is roughly:</span></p><ul><li><p><strong>Third Party API (via Amazon, etc)</strong><span>: 60-75% </span></p></li><li><p><strong>Direct API</strong><span>: 10-25%</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Claude chatbot subscriptions</strong><span>: 15% </span></p></li><li><p><strong>Professional Services</strong><span>: 2%</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>Margins: </strong><span>We don’t know much about Anthropic’s margins either, but again, they are expected to lose about ~$2B this year, on revenue in the high hundreds of millions. While a lot of this is largely compute and headcount, their business skew more towards they API, which if it does indeed support higher gross margins in the short to medium term, may be beneficial.</span></p><p>If you don’t yet receive Tanay's newsletter in your email inbox, please join the 9,000+ subscribers who do:</p><p>Putting the above together, we can make a few observations when comparing the two.

Anthropic is growing faster, however. At the start of the year, OpenAI was likely around 15x the scale of Anthropic.</p><p>Despite a lot of buzz around Anthropic’s latest class of models including Sonnet, and around Claude and features such as Artifacts, the vast majority of people who use ChatGPT have likely never even tried or heard of Anthropic’s Claude.</p><p><span>From a revenue perspective, ChatGPT will be bringing in about ~$2.7B at the end of the year for OpenAI, relative to Anthropic’s Claude bringing in about ~$150M. </span><strong>That makes ChatGPT about 18x the size from a revenue perspective</strong><span>. </span></p><p>Anthropic recently launched an enterprise version of Claude to bolster their Claude offering for businesses, but even there is likely far behind, with ChatGPT already boasting over 1M users on higher paid ChatGPT plans (enterprise/teams).</p><p>Anthropic generating ~65% of their revenue from their third party API highlights how important distribution is. According to many benchmarks, at least until OpenAI launched o-1, Anthropic’s sonnet and similar models have been the best for a number of use cases. But having a great product alone is insufficient, and distribution is equally if not even more important.</p><p><span>For Anthropic, that distribution, in the </span><strong>form of their partnership with Amazon</strong><span> to allow their models to be made available on AWS Bedrock seems to be driving the vast majority of their revenue.</span></p><p><span>I’m a bit surprised by how close things seem to be on the API front. It would appear that OpenAI is somewhere around ~$1.2-1.5B in run-rate revenue from its API revenue, while Anthropic is at around ~$800M in run-rate revenue. That would put </span><strong>OpenAI only about 50-100% larger than Anthropic on the API side</strong><span>, which is a much smaller gap than in aggregate.</span></p><p>Again, this seems to be largely driven by Anthropic’s success on the AWS platform. But I’m also surprised that OpenAI isn’t seeing even more uptick than they are from the Azure OpenAI usage and it raises the question around whether there is some difference in how Azure vs AWS API revenue is accounted for between OpenAI and Anthropic respectively.</p><p>Based on the losses that both have and the reported rounds they are raising ($6.5B in the case of OpenAI and likely &gt;1B in the case of Anthropic), it’s clear that foundation models will continue to require large amounts of capital, and that the number of players that can compete is quite small. We’re basically down to OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, Mistral, Google and X.AI as well as various other attempts by Amazon/Microsoft.</p><p>In addition, as these companies push towards profitability at some point (even if not immediately as capital is still available), they seem to be betting on a few trends:</p><ul><li><p>A large reduction in inference costs over time to improve margins on the subscription products / API</p></li><li><p>Potential price increases in consumer subscription plans as model capabiltiy improves. OpenAI has already hinted at increasing prices to $22/mo this year and up to $44/month over the coming years.</p></li><li><p>A shift from training-time compute to inference-time compute, as highlighted by o1, to somewhat slow the ballooning training costs every 1-2 years.</p></li></ul><p>In closing, here are a few of the publications and reports I used to triangulate various datapoints:</p><ol><li><p><a href="https://fortune.com/2024/09/28/openai-5-billion-loss-2024-revenue-forecasts-fundraising-chapgpt-fee-hikes/" rel="">Fortune piece on ChatGPT fundraise</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2024/09/24/ai-startup-anthropic-expects-revenue-surge-as-it-ramps-up-competition-with-openai.html" rel="">CNBC piece on Anthropic revenue and breakdown</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://futuresearch.ai/openai-api-profit" rel="">Futuresearch estimates on Gross Margins</a></p></li></ol></div></div>]]></description>
