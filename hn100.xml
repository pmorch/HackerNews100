After years of legal proceedings, New Zealand Justice Minister Paul Goldsmith has approved Kim Dotcom's extradition to the United States. The Megaaupload founder faces criminal copyright infringement, racketeering, and money laundering charges, which in theory could lead to decades in prison. Dotcom says he has a plan and doesn't intend to leave the country.

<p>While time moved on, the New Zealand-based ‘Internet personality’ was still waiting to hear whether he would be extradited to the United States where a criminal prosecution is pending.</p>
<p>With the stakes this high, no legal resources are being spared. Many <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/nz-government-lawyers-spent-40500-hours-battling-kim-dotcom-and-megaupload-210216/">millions of dollars</a> have been poured into this legal battle since 2012, and the end is still nowhere in sight.</p>
<p>In 2020, the Supreme Court of New Zealand <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/kim-dotcom-can-be-extradited-to-the-united-states-subject-to-judicial-review-201104/">ruled</a> that Kim Dotcom and his colleagues could indeed be extradited to the United States. However, this still wasn’t set in stone, as judicial reviews and appeals were still pending. </p>
<p>Megaupload defendants van der Kolk and Ortmann eventually opted for a deal. The pair pled guilty but were allowed to serve their respective <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/former-megaupload-executives-sentenced-to-2-5-years-in-prison-230615/">30 and 31-month prison sentences</a> in New Zealand. Dotcom, meanwhile, vowed to <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/megaupload-pair-sign-deal-to-avoid-extradition-dotcom-vows-to-fight-on-220510/">‘fight on’</a>. </p>
<p>“I’m now the last man standing in this fight and I will continue to fight because unlike my co-defendants I won’t accept the injustice we have been subjected to,” Dotcom said two years ago.</p>
<h2>Justice Minister Signs Dotcom Extradition</h2>
<p>In recent years, Dotcom hasn’t shied away from the public eye, often sharing controversial takes on political and societal events. In the background, however, potential extradition loomed, before reaching its conclusion earlier today.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/politics/350380271/justice-minister-signs-kim-doctoms-extradition-order">Stuff</a>, New Zealand Justice Minister Paul Goldsmith informed Kim Dotcom that he will be deported to the United States to stand trial. </p>
<p>“I have received extensive advice from the Ministry of Justice on this matter,” Goldsmith said. “I considered all of the information carefully, and have decided that Mr Dotcom should be surrendered to the US to face trial.”</p>
<p>“As is common practice, I have allowed Mr Dotcom a short period of time to consider and take advice on my decision. I will not, therefore, be commenting further at this stage,” the Justice Minister added.</p>
<p>Dotcom has always denied the charges and has left no stone unturned in support of his defense. This means that the latest extradition decision will be challenged as well.</p>
<h2>‘I Have a Plan’</h2>
<p>The Ministry of Justice confirmed the extradition order earlier today. Dotcom revealed the decision on social media earlier in the week, describing New Zealand as an “obedient U.S. colony”. </p>
<p>“[T]he obedient US colony in the South Pacific just decided to extradite me for what users uploaded to Megaupload, unsolicited, and what copyright holders were able to remove with direct delete access instantly and without question. But who cares? That’s justice these days,” he wrote on Tuesday. </p>
<p>Today, Dotcom <a href="https://x.com/KimDotcom/">followed up</a>, stating that he has “a plan,” “loves New Zealand,” and doesn’t intend to leave the country. </p>
<center><em>A Plan…</em></center><br><center><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/dotcom-plan.jpg" alt="dotcom plan" width="600" height="342" srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/dotcom-plan.jpg 972w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/dotcom-plan-300x171.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></center>
<p>The nature of Dotcom’s plan is unknown but if the past twelve years are any indication, he won’t let any adverse decision pass without a fight. </p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p><span>Comment</span> After more than 15 years of insisting that "competition is only a click away," Google's antitrust mantra is no longer keeping the regulators at bay.</p>
<p>Back in 2013, Google escaped unscathed from a US Federal Trade Commission probe when the watchdog agency <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/04/technology/google-agrees-to-changes-in-search-ending-us-antitrust-inquiry.html">closed</a> its investigation without bringing charges. Its other run-ins with competition cops around the world have been similarly inconsequential. There have been fines, but they've been immaterial.</p>
<p>In the past eight months, however, Google has lost two major US competition lawsuits: One brought by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/12/12/epic_v_google_epic_wins/">Epic Games</a> over Google's grip on the Android ecosystem, the other brought by the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/08/05/google_default_search_deals_violate/">Department of Justice</a> over the Big G's market-dominating search advertising business.</p>

    

<p>In the Epic Games case this week, the FTC – emboldened under boss Lina Khan – <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/08/13/ftc_google_android_monopoly/">urged the judge</a> to consider an appropriate remedy and ignore Google's fretting about the potential cost of compliance.</p>

        


        

<p>And in the DoJ's search advertising case, the focus has also turned to possible remedies, now that Google has been declared an unlawful monopolist.</p>
<p>The Chocolate Factory has <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/google-asks-judge-overturn-epic-games-antitrust-verdict-2024-02-02/">appealed</a> the Epic verdict and also plans to challenge the DoJ's victory.</p>

        

<p>However, given the EU's <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_23_3207">preliminary findings</a> in 2023 that Google violated antitrust laws with its advertising practices, and a separate trial this September over Justice Department <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-google-monopolizing-digital-advertising-technologies">allegations</a> about Google's ad tech operations, it's looking increasingly unlikely the search giant will survive in its current form or with its current arrangements.</p>
<p>Reports <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/13/technology/google-monopoly-antitrust-justice-department.html">suggest</a> American prosecutors working on the search advertising case have been discussing remedies including a corporate breakup, to present at a September 6 hearing. These measures include possibly slicing off Chrome and Android from Google into separate entities; forcing the internet giant to ditch its exclusive deals that make it the default search engine on devices and in browsers; and/or making it share data with rivals.</p>
<p>Jason Kint, CEO for trade group Digital Content Next, told <em>The Register</em> that with regard to the DoJ's search advertising case, "Forced divestiture of Chrome and Android I think are both on the table for sure."</p>

        

<p>"What the judge made clear was that they [Google] have an overwhelming monopoly in search," said Kint. "And they've abused it."</p>
<p>If the pending separate ad tech trial – which covers the backend auction part of Google's ad business – goes the same way as the search one, Google's DoubleClick business, or a related piece of ad auction infrastructure, could be on the chopping block.</p>
<p>One of the central issues in the DoJ's search ads case is the payments Google makes to Apple and Mozilla to be the default search engine in Safari and Firefox. If those go away, there will be blood – not just for Google but also for Apple and Mozilla.</p>
<p>Apple would have to find other revenue to replace roughly $20 billion in annual payments from Google. That might encourage the iBiz to compete with Google – by building its own search engine, or acquiring one. Mozilla, already <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/06/18/mozilla_buys_anonym_betting_privacy/">showing interest</a> in the ad business, might be pushed further in that direction – an outcome unlikely to appeal to the anti-commercial portion of its constituency.</p>
<p>A fitting though unlikely outcome would be for Google to be forced to turn Chrome and the open source Chromium project over to Mozilla. That would probably involve the creation of an independent non-profit foundation that didn't reduce browser diversity – so Chrome and Firefox could continue to lead independent lives.</p>

</ul>
<p>Chrome could also be operated as a for-profit business, but revenue generation might be an issue – netizens expect browsers to be free, so we'd be back to default search deals and selling information to advertisers.</p>
<p>The possibility of forcing the divestiture of Android is also intriguing – but it's unclear how Android development and app distribution would work if starved of Google's monopoly money.</p>
<p>It's worth asking whether any of Google's peers – Amazon, Apple, Meta, or Microsoft – could turn Android or Chrome into a business that better served the public. The answer is almost certainly not. After all, each of these giants also faces ongoing antitrust scrutiny. And each of them would probably look for ways to make Chrome or Android more extractive.</p>

<p>There's a real risk that a poorly targeted remedy would just allow some other data predator to thrive, or would degrade the overall ecosystem – as happened when wolves were <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.yellowstonepark.com/things-to-do/wildlife/wolf-reintroduction-changes-ecosystem/">removed</a> from Yellowstone. Imagine a Meta operating Google Play, and what the privacy disclosures would look like then.</p>
<p>The problem is that software platforms need regulation tuned to their specific abuses. Operating a software (or e-commerce) platform is similar to operating a shopping mall, except that platform landlords can impose arbitrary terms on tenants that would never fly in the physical world. In the tech industry, a platform is simply a vehicle for unfair competition – see the FTC <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/09/ftc-sues-amazon-illegally-maintaining-monopoly-power">allegations against Amazon</a>.</p>
<p>Say someone opens a shop selling maps and it proves popular. As the platform landlord, you may decide you too want to run a map shop. It would be a petty thing to do to a shop owner whose efforts and presence add value to your mall, but there's no law against it.</p>
<div><p><img src="https://regmedia.co.uk/2024/08/06/shutterstock_ublock_origin_reaper.jpg?x=174&amp;amp;y=115&amp;amp;crop=1" width="174" height="115" alt="Grim reaper by the uBlock Origin logo"></p><h2 title="Will you see the Lite?">Chrome Web Store warns end is nigh for uBlock Origin</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/08/06/chrome_web_store_warns_end/"><span>JUST FYI</span></a></p></div>
<p>And if your tenant's shop is doing better, you can rearrange the mall layout to make that shop harder to find while you move your own shop to the entryway where everyone will see it. Or you may decide to impose some arbitrary contractual rule that gives you an advantage. Perhaps you'll implement private APIs that make your maps function better while not allowing your tenant to use those APIs. Maybe you'll choose to charge a commission that makes it hard for the tenant to be profitable.</p>
<p>Such self-preferencing is common on software platforms, when it would cause an outcry or a lawsuit in an actual mall.</p>
<p>Forcing Google to divest Chrome or Android may help – but whatever remedy is imposed, it needs to also address self-preferencing, just as Europe's Digital Markets Act has done for designated gatekeepers. Platform owners should be forbidden from favoring their own services and competing unfairly with platform tenants. ®</p>

      Efficient and accurate filtering of polygonal shapes can be achieved with closed-form solutions based on Green's
      theorem with piecewise-polynomial filters (e.g. box/bilinear/bicubic).

    <p>
      Instead of relying on pixel-approximations or super-sampling to achieve filtering effects, it is possible to
      directly compute the exact filtered coverage, by:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Breaking the polygon up into smaller (usually-pixel-sized) clipped polygons</li>
      <li>Evaluating the filter integral directly for each clipped polygon</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Furthermore, this can be done on the GPU, and is demonstrated in WebGPU in this article (if it is enabled).
    </p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>
      Rasterization is the process of converting vector graphics into pixel data. When rendering a polygon, the rasterizer
      needs to determine how much the polygon <em>covers</em> each pixel, so that it can determine the polygon's contribution
      to the pixel.
    </p>

    <p>
      A fast approach, given many polygons, is to see how much of each polygon is contained within the box of each pixel.
      However, when polygons overlap, this approach can lead to over-coverage, and can result in incorrect blending
      known as <a href="https://phetsims.github.io/alpenglow/#overview-conflation">conflation artifacts</a>. To avoid this,
      it is ideal to compute exact (non-overlapping) coverage, but it can also be approximated by super-sampling.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Filtering</em> is a key component of anti-aliasing, which is used to reduce the visual artifacts that occur when rendering
      high-frequency content at a lower resolution.
    </p>

    <p>
      Browsers' built-in anti-aliasing for SVG and Canvas shapes, particularly when animated, usually does not include
      a significant amount of filtering. When displaying certain shapes, this results in aliasing artifacts that can be
      distracting or even misleading.
    </p>

    <h2>Filters</h2>

    <p>
      While <a href="http://alvyray.com/Memos/CG/Microsoft/6_pixel.pdf">a pixel is not a little square</a>, a simple way
      to get a coverage value is to use the area of the polygon that covers the pixel. This is equivalent to applying a
      <em>box filter</em> to the polygon, which is the simplest form of filtering.
    </p>

    </figure>

    <p>
      While the box filter results in a sharp result, it can result in
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_anti-aliasing#Examples">spatial aliasing artifacts</a>.
      These can be reduced by using other filters. Instead of taking the area of the polygon that covers a square around
      the center of the pixel, others will evaluate a different weighted function over the polygon.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilinear_interpolation">bilinear</a> and
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitchell%E2%80%93Netravali_filters">Mitchell-Netravali (bicubic)</a>
      filters are two common filters that are used in practice, and both
      are piecewise-polynomial filters.

    <p>
      These piecewise-polynomial filters are equivalent to taking the integral of the piecewise-polynomial function
      <em>within</em> the polygon, where the filter function is centered at where a sample is being taken. The box
      filter is equivalent to taking the integral of an indicator function that is 1 within the square, and 0 outside.

    <p>
      In particular, each of the above filters has one or more clipped areas of the polygon that will

    <h2>Green's Theorem and Polygons</h2>

    <p>
      We will dive into the math behind how we can evaluate the integral of a filter over a polygon using Green's Theorem.
      For more related results, see <a href="https://phetsims.github.io/alpenglow/#antialiasing-integrals">Alpenglow's integrals for anti-aliasing</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Overall:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>To evaluate an integral (i.e. a filter) over a shape, we can instead evaluate an integral over the boundary.</li>
      <li>For polygons, this means we can evaluate an expression for each edge (given $x_0$, $y_0$, $x_1$, and $y_1$), and sum those up.</li>
      <li>If the integrand is a polynomial, we get a closed-form solution that can be evaluated directly.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green%27s_theorem">Green's Theorem</a>, we can convert a double
      integral over a region into a line integral over the (closed, oriented counter-clockwise) boundary of the region:
    </p>

    <p>
      $$
      \oint_P\left(L\,\frac{dx}{dt}+M\,\frac{dy}{dt}\right)dt=\iint_P \left( \frac{\partial M}{\partial x}-\frac{\partial L}{\partial y} \right)\,dx\,dy
      $$
    </p>

    <p>
      for curves parameterized on $t$.
    </p>

    <p>
      For polygons, this means that if we can evaluate a line integral over each line segment (between $(x_i,y_i)$ and
      $(x_{i+1},y_{i+1})$, finishing with $(x_i,y_i)$ to $(x_0,y_0)$), we can sum up each edge's contribution to
      evaluate the double integral for the region inside the polygon. Each line segment is parameterized curve:
    </p>

    <p>
      $$
      x=x(t)=(1-t)x_i+(t)x_{i+1}=x_i+t(x_{i+1}-x_i)
      $$

      $$
      y=y(t)=(1-t)y_i+(t)y_{i+1}=y_i+t(y_{i+1}-y_i)
      $$

      for $0 \le t \le 1$, with the derivatives:

      $$
      \frac{dx}{dt}=x_{i+1}-x_i
      $$

      $$
      \frac{dy}{dt}=y_{i+1}-y_i
      $$

      Note:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        If we reverse an edge (swap its endpoints), it will swap the sign of the contribution to the integral (a polygon
        can make a degenerate turn and double-back precisely, with no contribution to area). Thus for terms, swapping $i$
        and $i+1$ will swap the sign of the contribution. This means that polygons with holes can be evaluated by
        visiting the holes with the opposite orientation (clockwise).
      </li>
      <li>
        This is evaluated on closed polygons, so any terms that only depend on one endpoint will cancel out (e.g.
        $x_i^2y_i$ and $-x_{i+1}^2y_{i+1}$ will have their contributions cancel out, since both of those will be
        evaluated for every point in the polygon). It is useful to adjust the coefficients to these terms, since they
        can allow us to factor the expressions into simpler forms (e.g. the Shoelace formula below).
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      We can pick $L$ and $M$ below:

      $$
      L=(n-1)\int f\,dy
      $$

      $$
      M=(n)\int f\,dx
      $$

      so that

      $$
      \iint_P \left( \frac{\partial M}{\partial x}-\frac{\partial L}{\partial y} \right)\,dx\,dy=
      \iint_P \left( (n)f - (n-1)f \right)\,dx\,dy=
      \iint_P f\,dx\,dy
      $$

      for any antiderivatives and real $n$, since the double integral will then be integrating our function $f$. It turns
      out, evaluating Green's Theorem over line segments for polynomial terms for any linear blend (any $n$) of $L$ and
      $M$ will differ only in the "canceled out" terms, so each edge's contribution will be the same.

    <h2>Integrating Polynomials over Polygons</h2>

    <p>
      If we zero out all of the canceled terms, it turns out that we can evaluate the integral of any polynomial term $x^my^n$ over a polygon $P$ by summing up the contributions of each edge:
    </p>
    <p>
      $$
      \iint_Px^my^n\,dx\,dy=\frac{m!n!}{(m+n+2)!}\sum_{i}\left[ (x_iy_{i+1}-x_{i+1}y_i) \sum_{p=0}^m\sum_{q=0}^n \binom{p+q}{q}\binom{m+n-p-q}{n-q}x_i^{m-p}x_{i+1}^py_i^{n-q}y_{i+1}^q \right]
      \tag{1}
      $$
    </p>
    <p>
      This was first discovered by <a href="https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid%3A963296a1-8940-4439-9404-eca1bd2f8638">Soerjadi in 1968</a>.
      The contributions of each term can be summed up individually to integrate arbitrary polynomials.
    </p>

    <p>
      e.g. for $x^4y^2$ in matrix form:
    </p>
    <p>
      $$
      \iint_Px^4y^2\,dx\,dy=
      \frac{1}{840}
      \sum_{i}
      \left(
      (x_iy_{i+1}-x_{i+1}y_i)
      \begin{bmatrix}
      x_i^4 &amp; x_i^3x_{i+1} &amp; x_i^2x_{i+1}^2 &amp; x_ix_{i+1}^3 &amp; x_{i+1}^4
      \end{bmatrix}
      \begin{bmatrix}
      15 &amp; 5 &amp; 1\\
      10 &amp; 8 &amp; 3\\
      6 &amp; 9 &amp; 6\\
      3 &amp; 8 &amp; 10\\
      1 &amp; 5 &amp; 15
      \end{bmatrix}
      \begin{bmatrix}
      y_i^2\\
      y_iy_{i+1}\\
      y_{i+1}^2
      \end{bmatrix}
      \right)
      $$
    </p>

    <p>
      Any polynomial-based (windowed or not) filter can be evaluated over a polygon with this approach. It may be
      feasible to approximate Gaussian/Sinc filters with polynomials, or find iterative approaches to converge to the
      integral.
    </p>

    <h2>Integrals for Filters</h2>

    <h3>Box Filter (Area)</h3>

    <p>
      As seen above, the box filter is equivalent to a step function that is 1 within the box and 0 outside. When a polygon
      has been clipped, this is equivalent to evaluating the integral of $1$ inside the polygon (i.e. computing its area).
    </p>

    <figure>
      <img src="https://jonathanolson.net/img/box-filter.png" alt="Box filter">
    </figure>

    <p>
      For $x^0y^0=1$, with adding some canceling terms to better factor, we will obtain the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoelace_formula">Shoelace formula</a> for finding the area of a polygon:

      $$
      area_P=\iint_P1\,dx\,dy=
      \frac{1}{2}
      \sum_{i}
      (x_i+x_{i+1})(y_{i+1}-y_i)
      $$
    </p>

    <p>
      This formula will be evaluated (with the appropriate order and orientation) for every edge
      ($x_i$, $y_i$, $x_{i+1}$, $y_{i+1}$) along a polygon. The sum will be the area of the polygon.
    </p>

    <h3>Bilinear Filter</h3>

    <p>
      The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilinear_interpolation">bilinear filter</a> is equivalent to integrating
      the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_function">tent function</a> over the polygon. As seen above,
      this is broken into 4 quadrants, each of which is a polynomial function.
    </p>

    <figure>
      <img src="https://jonathanolson.net/img/bilinear-filter.png" alt="Bilinear filter">
    </figure>

    <p>
      Without loss of generality, we can focus on computing the integral solely in the $0\le x\le1,0\le y\le1$ quadrant.
      The integrand is thus:
    </p>

    <p>
      $$
      (1-x)(1-y)=xy-x-y+1
      $$
    </p>

    <p>
      This is a weighted sum of the terms $x^1y^1$, $x^1y^0$, $x^0y^1$, and $x^0y^0$. We can sum up the weighted contribution
      of the corresponding terms from $\tag{1}$, resulting in the following evaluated line integral:
    </p>

    <p>
      $$
      \frac{1}{24}\sum_{i}(x_iy_{i+1}-x_{i+1}y_i)(12-4( x_i+y_i+x_{i+1}+y_{i+1})+2(x_iy_i+x_{i+1}y_{i+1})+
      x_iy_{i+1}+x_{i+1}y_i)
      $$
    </p>

    <p>
      This formula will be evaluated (with the appropriate order and orientation) for every edge
      ($x_i$, $y_i$, $x_{i+1}$, $y_{i+1}$) along a polygon (clipped to the unit square). The sum will be the
      integral of this quadrant of bilinear filter over the polygon (with the filter centered at the origin).
      Coordinate transformations can be used to evaluate the other quadrants (applying the absolute value to inputs).
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that the polygon needs to be clipped so that it is fully contained within the unit square.
    </p>

    <h3>Mitchell-Netravali Filter</h3>

    <p>
      The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitchell%E2%80%93Netravali_filters">Mitchell-Netravali filter family</a>,
      commonly referred to as "bicubic", is a piecewise-polynomial filter that that has a larger support, and includes
      negative lobes to reduce artifacts. It has 16 different polynomial pieces, which will require the integral evaluation
      of 3 different pieces.
    </p>

    <figure>
      <img src="https://jonathanolson.net/img/mitchell-netravali-filter.png" alt="Mitchell-Netravali (bicubic) filter">
    </figure>

    <p>
      We choose to use the "Mitchell-Netravali" filter (specifically with constants $B=1/3$ and $C=1/3$). It is separable
      and symmetric, so the integral is equal to $f(x)f(y)$, combining 1-dimensional kernels. The two polynomial chunks we
      get (assuming a $t &gt; 0$) are:
    </p>

    <p>
      $$
      f_0(t)=\frac{1}{6}\left(7y^3-12t^2+\frac{16}{3}\right)
      $$
    </p>

    <p>
      for $0\le t\le1$, and:
    </p>

    <p>
      $$
      f_1(t)=\frac{1}{6}\left(-\frac{7}{3}y^3+12t^2-20t+\frac{32}{3}\right)
      $$
    </p>

    <p>
      for $1\le t\le2$.
    </p>

    <p>
      Taking into account symmetry, this gives us three different polynomial chunks we will need to evaluate:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>$f_0(x)f_0(y)$</li>
      <li>$f_0(x)f_1(y)$</li>
      <li>$f_1(x)f_1(y)$</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Since the others can be obtained by reversing signs and/or reflection with swapping x/y input.
    </p>

    <p>
      All three of these can be evaluated using the formula $\tag{1}$, since they are simply polynomials in $x$ and $y$.
      Notably:
    </p>

    <p>
      $$
      f_0(x)f_0(y)=
      \begin{bmatrix}1 &amp; x &amp; x^2 &amp; x^3\end{bmatrix}
      \begin{bmatrix}
      \frac{64}{81} &amp; 0 &amp; -\frac{16}{9} &amp; \frac{28}{27}\\

      \frac{28}{27} &amp; 0 &amp; -\frac{7}{3} &amp; \frac{49}{36}
      \end{bmatrix}
      \begin{bmatrix}1\\y\\y^2\\y^3\end{bmatrix}
      $$
    </p>

    <p>
      $$
      f_0(x)f_1(y)=
      \begin{bmatrix}1 &amp; x &amp; x^2 &amp; x^3\end{bmatrix}
      \begin{bmatrix}
      \frac{128}{81} &amp; -\frac{80}{27} &amp; \frac{16}{9} &amp; -\frac{28}{81}\\
      0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
      -\frac{32}{9} &amp; \frac{20}{3} &amp; -4 &amp; \frac{7}{9}\\
      \frac{56}{27} &amp; -\frac{35}{9} &amp; \frac{7}{3} &amp; -\frac{49}{108}
      \end{bmatrix}
      \begin{bmatrix}1\\y\\y^2\\y^3\end{bmatrix}
      $$
    </p>

    <p>
      $$
      f_1(x)f_1(y)=
      \begin{bmatrix}1 &amp; x &amp; x^2 &amp; x^3\end{bmatrix}
      \begin{bmatrix}
      \frac{256}{81} &amp; -\frac{160}{27} &amp; \frac{32}{9} &amp; -\frac{56}{81}\\
      -\frac{160}{27} &amp; \frac{100}{9} &amp; -\frac{20}{3} &amp; \frac{35}{27}\\
      \frac{32}{9} &amp; -\frac{20}{3} &amp; 4 &amp; -\frac{7}{9}\\

      \end{bmatrix}
      \begin{bmatrix}1\\y\\y^2\\y^3\end{bmatrix}
      $$
    </p>

    <p>
      Long story short, evaluating $\tag{1}$ for these, we get some reasonably long expressions that can be evaluated directly.
    </p>

    <p>
      For example: $f_0(x)f_0(y)$ results in:

    <p>
      Common terms can be factored out, speeding this up somewhat, but it is still less efficient than the bilinear case.

  <section id="blurring">
    <h2>Blurring</h2>

    <p>
      While the typical filter size is small (and may slightly blur the edges of a polygon), it is possible to dramatically
      expand the size of the filter (computed for each pixel) to intentionally blur the polygon. Generally when this
      is done, each of the clipped piecewise-polynomial sections will NOT overlap with those of other pixels, so it takes
      a bit more computation and clipping to evaluate the integral.
    </p>

    <figure id="only-webgpu-1">
      <canvas id="blur-example" alt="Displays a rotating scene with a customizable blur"></canvas>
      <br>
      <label for="blur-slider">Blur Radius</label>
      <br>
      
      
      <p>
        <label for="blur-box">Box</label>
        
        <label for="blur-bilinear">Bilinear</label>
      </p>
    </figure>

    

    <p>
      Note that large blur radii are not too much more expensive than small ones, it depends on the geometry of the
      scene. Each pixel will need to have access to the geometry and shading within its support region. The demo above
      is slowed down by the GC-hungry CPU procedure that computes occlusion.
    </p>

  </section>
  <section id="implementation">
    <h2>Implementation</h2>

    <p>
      <a href="https://phetsims.github.io/alpenglow/">Alpenglow</a> has both a CPU and WebGPU implementation of this
      filtering during rasterization. Both approaches will typically hierarchically clip the polygon into smaller pieces
      (on the GPU, using the edge-clipped form noted in Alpenglow documentation).
    </p>

    <p>
      On the GPU, this has been done so far by clipping things into approximately 256x256 tiles, and then further into
      approximately 16x16 sub-tiles, at which the final clipping can be done during the rasterization. There are multiple
      approaches (using WebGPU compute shaders) to doing this efficiently, it is something I'm working on!
    </p>

    <p>
      The clipped regions need to be expanded by the radius of the filter's support. For example, the bilinear filter
      will need to be expanded by 1 pixel in each direction, and the bicubic filter will need to be expanded by 2 pixels
      (from the pixel centers).
    </p>

    <p>
      It turns out that for normal filter sizes, the clipped regions for different pixels will overlap
      (e.g. for bilinear, pixel 0,0 and 1,1, one of the quadrants will be shared). Thus on the GPU, a workgroup can
      compute a 16x16 grid of clipped polygons, evaluate all of the 4 potential integrals, and for speed can evaluate
      the color of that region. Then those integrals can be used to blend the results into a 15x15 section of pixels.
    </p>

    <p>
      This method is the most effective when the occlusion problem has already been solved (e.g. with
      a computation-area geometry approach like <a href="https://phetsims.github.io/alpenglow/">Alpenglow</a>).
      With that type of approach, the clipped regions will not overlap, and the integrals can be evaluated directly.

<section>
<p>I decided to write this post because there's no concise way to explain the nuances of <a href="https://www.conchovalleyhomepage.com/news/data-of-3-billion-people-exposed-in-one-of-the-largest-data-breaches-in-history-heres-what-you-need-to-know/?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">what's being described as one of the largest data breaches ever</a>. Usually, it's easy to articulate a data breach; a service people provide their information to had someone snag it through an act of unauthorised access and publish a discrete corpus of information that can be attributed back to that source. But in the case of National Public Data, we're talking about a data aggregator most people had never heard of where a "threat actor" has published various <em>partial </em>sets of data with no clear way to attribute it back to the source. And <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/privacy-and-data-security/background-check-data-of-3-billion-stolen-in-breach-suit-says?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">they're already the subject of a class action</a>, to add yet another variable into the mix. I've been collating information related to this incident over the last couple of months, so let me talk about what's known about the incident, what data is circulating and what remains a bit of a mystery.</p><p>Let's start with the easy bit - who is <a href="https://nationalpublicdata.com/?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">National Public Data</a> (NPD)? They're what we refer to as a "data aggregator", that is they provide services based on the large volumes of personal information they hold. From the front page of their website:</p><blockquote>Criminal Records, Background Checks and more. Our services are currently used by investigators, background check websites, data resellers, mobile apps, applications and more.</blockquote><p>There are <em>many</em> legally operating data aggregators out there... and there are many that end up with their data in <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">Have I Been Pwned</a> (HIBP). For example, <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/questions-about-the-massive-south-african-master-deeds-data-breach-answered/" rel="noreferrer">Master Deeds</a>, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/exactis-database-leak-340-million-records/?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">Exactis</a> and <a href="https://hackenproof.com/blog/industry-news/another-decision-makers-database-leaked?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">Adapt</a>, to name but a few. In April, we started seeing news of National Public Data and billions of breached records, with one of the first references coming from the Dark Web Intelligence account:</p>

<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">USDoD Allegedly Breached National Public Data Database, Selling 2.9 Billion Records <a href="https://t.co/emQIZ0lgsn?ref=troyhunt.com">https://t.co/emQIZ0lgsn</a> <a href="https://t.co/Tt8UNppPSu?ref=troyhunt.com">pic.twitter.com/Tt8UNppPSu</a></p>— Dark Web Intelligence (@DailyDarkWeb) <a href="https://twitter.com/DailyDarkWeb/status/1777335594567283045?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=troyhunt.com">April 8, 2024</a></blockquote> 

<p>Back then, the breach was attributed to "USDoD", a name to remember as you'll see that throughout this post. The embedded image is the first reference of the 2.9B number we've subsequently seen flashed all over the press, and it's right there alongside the request of $3.5M for the data. Clearly, there is a financial motive involved here, so keep that in mind as we dig further into the story. That image also refers to 200GB of compressed data that expands out to 4TB when uncompressed, but that's not what initially caught my eye. Instead, something quite obvious in the embedded image doesn't add up: if this data is "the entire population of USA, CA and UK" (which is ~450M people in total), what's the 2.9B number we keep seeing? Because that doesn't reconcile with reports about <a href="https://mashable.com/article/background-check-company-breached-3-billion-affected?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">"nearly 3 billion people" with social security numbers exposed</a>. Further, SSNs are a rather American construct with Canada having SINs (Social Insurance Number) and the UK having, well, NI (National Insurance) numbers are probably the closestequivalent. This is the constant theme you'll read about in this post, stuff just being a bit... off. But hyperbole is often a theme with incidents like this, so let's take the headlines with a grain of salt and see what the data tells us.</p><p>I was first sent data allegedly sourced from NPD in early June. The corpus I received reconciled with what vx-underground reported on around the same time (note their reference to the 8th of April, which also lines up with the previous tweet):</p>

<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>April 8th, 2024, a Threat Actor operating under the moniker "USDoD" placed a large database up for sale on Breached titled: "National Public Data". They claimed it contained 2,900,000,000 records on United States citizens. They put the data up for sale for $3,500,000.</p><p>National…</p></div>— vx-underground (@vxunderground) <a href="https://twitter.com/vxunderground/status/1797047998481854512?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=troyhunt.com">June 1, 2024</a></blockquote> 

<p>In their message, they refer to having received data totalling 277.1GB <em>uncompressed, </em>which aligns with the sum total of the 2 files I received:</p><figure><img src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2024/08/image-2.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="444" height="342"></figure><p>They also mentioned the data contains first and last names, addresses and SSNs, all of which appear in the first file above (among other fields):</p><figure><img src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2024/08/image-1.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1185" height="219" srcset="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/08/image-1.png 600w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/08/image-1.png 1000w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2024/08/image-1.png 1185w"></figure><p>These first rows also line up precisely with <a href="https://dailydarkweb.net/usdod-allegedly-leaks-national-public-data-database-exposing-2-9-billion-records/?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">the post Dark Web Intelligence included in the earlier tweet</a>. And in case you're looking at it and thinking "that's the same SSN repeated across multiple rows with different names", those records are all the same people, just with the names represented in different orders and with different addresses (all in the same city). In other words, those 6 rows only represent one person, which got me thinking about the ratio of rows to distinct numbers. Curious, I took 100M samples and found that only 31% of the rows had unique SSNs, so extrapolating that out, 2.9B would be more like 899M. This is something to always be conscious of when you read headline numbers: "2.9B" doesn't necessarily mean 2.9B <em>people</em>, it often means <em>rows of data</em>. Speaking of which, those 2 files contain 1,698,302,004 and 997,379,506 rows respectively for a combined total of 2.696B. Is this where the headline number comes from? Perhaps, it's close, and <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-leak-27-billion-data-records-with-social-security-numbers/?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">it's also precisely the same as Bleeping Computer reported a few days ago</a>.</p><p>At this point in the story, there's no question that there is legitimate data in there. From the aforementioned Bleeping Computer story:</p><blockquote>numerous people have confirmed to us that it included their and family members'&nbsp;legitimate information, including those who are deceased</blockquote><p>And in vx-underground's tweet, they mention that:</p><blockquote>It also allowed us to find their parents, and nearest siblings. We were able to identify someones parents, deceased relatives, Uncles, Aunts, and Cousins. Additionally, we can confirm this database also contains informed on individuals who are deceased. Some individuals located had been deceased for nearly 2 decades.</blockquote><p>A quick tangential observation in the same tweet:</p><blockquote>The database DOES NOT contain information from individuals who use data opt-out services. Every person who used some sort of data opt-out service was not present.</blockquote><p>Which is what you'd expect from a legally operating data aggregator service. It's a minor point, but it does support the claim that the data came from NPD.</p><p><strong>Important:</strong> None of the data discussed so far contains email addresses. That doesn't necessarily make it any less impactful for those involved, but it's an important point I'll come back to later as it relates to HIBP.</p><p>So, this data appeared in limited circulation as early as 3 months ago. It contains a huge amount of personal information (even if it isn't "2.9B people"), and then to make matters worse, it was posted publicly last week:</p>

<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">National Public Data, a service by Jerico Pictures Inc., suffered <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/databreach?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=troyhunt.com">#databreach</a>. Hacker “Fenice” leaked 2.9b records with personal details, including full names, addresses, &amp; SSNs in plain text. <a href="https://t.co/fXY3SXEiKe?ref=troyhunt.com">https://t.co/fXY3SXEiKe</a></p>— Wolf Technology Group (@WolfTech) <a href="https://twitter.com/WolfTech/status/1820883462082973977?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=troyhunt.com">August 6, 2024</a></blockquote> 

<p>Who knows who "Fenice" is and what role they play, but clearly multiple parties had access to this data well in advance of last week. I've reviewed what they posted, and it aligns with what I was sent 2 months ago, which is bad. But on the flip side, at least it has allowed services designed to protect data breach victims to get notices out to them:</p>

<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Twice this week I was alerted my SSN was found on the web thanks to a data breach at National Public Data. Cool. Thanks guys. <a href="https://t.co/FAlfNmXUqm?ref=troyhunt.com">pic.twitter.com/FAlfNmXUqm</a></p>— MrsNineTales (@MrsNineTales) <a href="https://twitter.com/MrsNineTales/status/1821586613111345594?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=troyhunt.com">August 8, 2024</a></blockquote> 

<p>Inevitably, breaches of this nature result in legal action, which, as I mentioned in the opening paragraph, <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/privacy-and-data-security/background-check-data-of-3-billion-stolen-in-breach-suit-says?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">began a couple of weeks ago</a>. It looks like a tip-off from a data protection service was enough for someone to bring a case against NPD:</p><blockquote>Named plaintiff Christopher Hofmann, a California resident, said he received a notification from his identity-theft protection service provider on July 24, notifying him that his data was exposed in a breach and leaked on the dark web.</blockquote><p>Up until this point, pretty much everything lines up, but for one thing: Where is the 4TB of data? And this is where it gets messy as we're now into the territory of "partial" data. For example, this corpus from last month was posted to a popular hacking forum:</p>

<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>National Public Database Allegedly Partially Leaked</p><p>It is stated that nearly 80 GB of sensitive data from the National Public Data is available.</p><p>The post contains different credits for the leakage and the alleged breach was credited to a threat actor “Sxul” and stressed that it… <a href="https://t.co/v8uq0o88NS?ref=troyhunt.com">https://t.co/v8uq0o88NS</a> <a href="https://t.co/a6dn3MvYkf?ref=troyhunt.com">pic.twitter.com/a6dn3MvYkf</a></p></div>— Dark Web Intelligence (@DailyDarkWeb) <a href="https://twitter.com/DailyDarkWeb/status/1815722467798680005?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=troyhunt.com">July 23, 2024</a></blockquote> 

<p>That's 80GB, and whilst it's not clear whether that's the size of the compressed or extracted archive, either way, it's still a long way short of the full alleged 4TB. Do take note of the file name in the embedded image, though - "people_data-935660398-959524741.csv" - as this will come up again later on.</p><p>Earlier this month, a 27-part corpus of data alleged to have come from NPD was posted to Telegram, this image representing the first 10 parts at 4GB each:</p><figure><img src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2024/08/image-3.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="324" height="634"></figure><p>The compressed archive files totalled 104GB and contained what feels like a fairly random collection of data:</p><figure><img src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2024/08/image-4.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="736" height="1012" srcset="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/08/image-4.png 600w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2024/08/image-4.png 736w"></figure><p>Many of these files are archives themselves, with many of <em>those </em>then containing yet more archives. I went through and recursively extracted everything which resulted in a total corpus of 642GB of uncompressed data across more than 1k files. If this is "partial", what was the story with the 80GB "partial" from last month? Who knows, but in the in those files above were 134M unique email addresses.</p><p>Just to take stock of where we're at, we've got the first set of SSN data which is legitimate and contains no email addresses yet is allegedly only a small part of the total NPD corpus. Then we've got this second set of data which is larger and has tens of millions of email addresses yet is pretty random in appearance. The burning question I was trying to answer is "is it legit?"</p><p>The problem with verifying breaches sourced from data aggregators is that nobody willingly - <em>knowingly</em> - provides their data to them, so I can't do my usual trick of just asking impacted HIBP subscribers if they'd used NPD before. Usually, I also can't just look at a data aggregator breach and find pointers that tie it back to the company in question due to references in the data mentioning their service. In part, that's because this data is just so damn generic. Take the earlier screenshot with the SSN data; how many different places have your first and last name, address, SSN, etc? Attributing a source when there's only generic data to go by is <em>extremely</em> difficult.</p><p>The kludge of different file types and naming conventions in the image above worried me. Is this actually all from NPD? Usually, you'd see some sort of continuity, for example, a heap of .json files with similar names or a swathe of .sql files with each one representing a dumped table. The presence of "people_data-935660398-959524741.csv" ties this corpus together with the one from the earlier tweet, but then there's stuff like "Accuitty_10_1_2022.zip"; could that refer to Acuity (single "c", single "t") <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/acuity-who-attempts-and-failures-to-attribute-437gb-of-breached-data/" rel="noreferrer">which I wrote about in November</a>? HIBP isn't returning hits for email addresses in that folder against the Acuity I loaded last year, so no, it's a different corpus. But that archive alone ended up having over 250GB of data with almost 100M unique email addresses, so it forms a <em>substantial</em> part of the overall corpus of data.</p><p>The 3,608,086KB "criminal_export.csv.zip" file caught my eye, in part because <a href="https://nationalpublicdata.com/services.html?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">criminal record checks are a key component NPD's services</a>, but also because it was only a few months ago we saw <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2024/05/criminal-record-database-of-millions-of-americans-dumped-online?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">another breach containing 70M rows from a US criminal database</a>. And see who that breach was attributed to? USDoD, the same party whose name is all over the NPD breach. I did actually receive that data but filed it away and didn't load it into HIBP as there were no email addresses in it. I wonder if the data from that story lines up with the file in the image above? Let's check the archives:</p><figure><img src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2024/08/image-5.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="604" height="56" srcset="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/08/image-5.png 600w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2024/08/image-5.png 604w"></figure><p>Different file name, but hey, it's a 3,608,086KB file! Given the NPD breach initially occurred in April and the criminal data hit the news in May, it's entirely possible the latter was obtained from the former, but I couldn't find any mention of this correlation anywhere. (Side note: this is a <em>perfect</em> example of why I retain breaches in offline storage after processing because they're so often helpful when assessing the origin and legitimacy of <em>new </em>breaches).</p><p>Continuing the search for oddities, I decided to see if I myself was in there. On many occasions now, I've loaded a breach, started the notification process running, walked away from the PC then received an email from myself about being in the breach 🤦‍♂️ I'm continually surprised by the places I find <em>myself</em> in, including this one:</p><figure><img src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2024/08/image-6.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1062" height="504" srcset="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/08/image-6.png 600w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/08/image-6.png 1000w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2024/08/image-6.png 1062w"></figure><p>Dammit! It's an email address of mine, yet clearly, none of the other data is mine. Not my name, not my address, and the obfuscated numbers definitely aren't familiar to me (I don't believe they're SSNs or other sensitive identifiers, but because I can't be sure, I've obfuscated them). I suspect one of those numbers is a serialised date of birth, but of the total <em>28 rows with my email address on them</em>, the two unique DoBs put "me" as being born in either 1936 or 1967. Both are a long way from the truth.</p><p>A cursory review of the other data in this corpus revealed a wide array of different personal attributes. One file contained information such as height, weight, eye colour, and ethnicity. The "uk.txt" file in the image above merely contained a business directory with public information. I could have dug deeper, but by now, there was no point. There's clearly some degree of invalid data in here, there's definitely data we've seen appear separately as a discrete breach, and there are many different versions of "partial" NPD data (although the 27-part archive discussed here is the largest I saw and the one I was most consistently directed to by other people). The more I searched, the more bits and pieces attributed back to NPD I found:</p><figure><img src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2024/08/image-7.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="604" height="368" srcset="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/08/image-7.png 600w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2024/08/image-7.png 604w"></figure><p>If I were to take a guess, there are two likely explanations for what we're seeing:</p><ol><li>This incident got a lot of press due to the legitimacy of the initial dump of SSNs, and the subsequent partial dumps are riding on the coattails of breach hysteria</li><li>NPD siphoned up a heap of publicly circulating data to enrich their offering, and it got snagged along with the initially released SSN data</li></ol><p>Both of these are purely speculative, though, and the only parties that know the truth are the anonymous threat actors passing the data around and the data aggregator that's now being sued in a class action, so yeah, we're not going to see any reliable clarification any time soon. Instead, we're left with 134M email addresses in public circulation and no clear origin or accountability. I sat on the fence about what to do with this data for days, not sure whether I should load it and, if I did, whether I should write about it. Eventually, I decided it deserved a place in HIBP as <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/FAQs?ref=troyhunt.com#UnverifiedBreach" rel="noreferrer">an unverified breach</a>, and per the opening sentence, this blog post was the only way I could properly explain the nuances of what I discovered. This way, impacted people will know if their data is floating around in this corpus, and if they find this information unactionable, then they can do precisely what they would have done had I not loaded it - nothing.</p><p>Lastly, I want to re-emphasise a point I made earlier on: <em>there were no email addresses in the social security number files</em>. If you find yourself in this data breach via HIBP, there's no evidence your SSN was leaked, and if you're in the same boat as me, the data next to your record may not even be correct. And no, I don't have a mechanism to load additional attributes beyond email address into HIBP nor point people in the direction of the source data (<a href="https://x.com/haveibeenpwned/status/1821844023088464377?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">some of you will have received a reminder about why I don't do that just a few days ago</a>). And I'm <em>definitely </em>not equipped to be your personal lookup service, manually trawling through the data and pulling out individual records for you!

                                <p><strong><span>The night that Stephen Paddock opened fire on thousands of people at a Las Vegas country music concert, nearby Sunrise Hospital received more than 200 penetrating gunshot wound victims. Dr. Kevin Menes was the attending in charge of the ED that night, and thanks to his experience supporting a local SWAT team, he’d thought ahead about how he might mobilize his department in the event of a mass casualty incident. </span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>This is his story<em>, a</em></span><em><span>s told to Judith Tintinalli, MD, MS<br>
</span></em><span>Edited by Logan Plaster</span></strong></p>
<p>I’m a night shift doc. My work week is Friday to Monday, 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. Most people don’t want to work those shifts. But that’s when most of the action comes in, so that’s when I work. It was a Sunday night when the EMS telemetry call came in to alert Sunrise Hospital of a mass casualty incident. All hospitals in Las Vegas are notified in a MCI to prepare for incoming patients.</p><div id="polis-567885981" data-polis-trackid="17826" data-polis-trackbid="1" data-polis-redirect="1"><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><a data-bid="1" data-no-instant="1" href="https://epmonthly.com/linkout/17826" rel="noopener sponsored" target="_blank" aria-label="mayoclinic"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://epmonthly.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/mayoclinic.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="250"></a></p></div>
<p>As I listened to the tele, there happened to be a police officer who was there for an unrelated incident. I saw him looking at his radio. I asked him, “Hey. Is this real?” and he said, “Yeah, man.” I ran down to my car and grabbed my police radio. The first thing that I heard when I turned it on to the area command was officers yelling, “Automatic fire…country music concert.” Ten o’clock at night at an open air concert, automatic fire into 10-20 thousand people or more in an open field—that’s a lot of people who could get hurt.</p>
<p>At that point, I put into action a plan that I had thought of beforehand. It might sound odd, but I had thought about these problems well ahead of time because of the way I always approached resuscitations:</p>
<ol>
<li>Preplan ahead</li>
<li>Ask hard questions</li>
<li>Figure out solutions</li>
<li>Mentally rehearse plans so that when the problem arrives, you don’t have to jump over a mental hurdle since the solution is already worked out</li>
</ol>
<p>It’s an open secret that Las Vegas is a big target because of its large crowds. For years I had been planning how I would handle a MCI, but I rarely shared it because people might think I was crazy.</p><div id="polis-1983054717" data-polis-trackid="17783" data-polis-trackbid="1" data-polis-redirect="1"><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><a data-bid="1" data-no-instant="1" href="https://epmonthly.com/linkout/17783" rel="noopener sponsored" target="_blank" aria-label="tring"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://epmonthly.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/tring.png" alt="" width="300" height="250"></a></p></div>
<p>The first thing I did was tell the secretaries I needed every operating room open. I needed every scrub tech, every nurse, every perfusionist, every anesthesiologist, every surgeon—they all need to get here right away. They immediately began making phone calls. I told the trauma nurses that I needed all the treatment areas completely clear. Nurses were instructed to keep an eye out for crashing patients and make sure that all patients had bilateral 14-18 gauge IVs ready for the moment that they would decompensate.</p>
<p>We also initiated our hospital’s “code triage,” in which staff from upstairs would come down to help by bringing down gurneys and spare manpower. We took all of our empty ED beds and wheelchairs<span>&nbsp;</span>out into the ambulance bay. Anybody who could push a patient, from environmental services to EKG techs to CNAs, came out to the ambulance bay. I said to the staff, “I’ll call it out. I’ll tell you guys where to go, and you guys bring these people in.”</p>
<p>When the shooting started, there were four emergency physicians, one trauma surgeon, and a trauma resident in the ER. That night I was working with Dr. Patrick Flores and Dr. James Walker, two physicians I’ve worked with for over five years. We’ve gotten in trouble together many times for doing thoracotomies before the surgeon could arrive. I know how these guys work. We’ve done major resuscitations together. We are like brothers. We also had a new guy, Dr. Michael Tang, who just graduated residency and had been there for a few months. Dr. Allan MacIntyre was the Trauma Surgeon working that night.</p><div id="polis-651941422" data-polis-trackid="17862" data-polis-trackbid="1" data-polis-redirect="1"><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><a data-bid="1" data-no-instant="1" href="https://epmonthly.com/linkout/17862" rel="noopener sponsored" target="_blank" aria-label="MTN EP 300×250 0923"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://epmonthly.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/MTN-EP-300x250-0923.png" alt="" width="300" height="250"></a></p></div>

<p>Here is how our emergency department is laid out. Station 1 has a central desk with four trauma bays. Trauma 1 and 2 have two beds in each bay. Trauma 3 and 4 have one bed in each bay. The most critical care traumas usually go to Trauma 3 and 4. Also attached to Station 1 is our critical care pod. That has four beds in it. Adjacent to that is our psychiatric area where we fit eight beds close together. Station 2 is down the hallway from Station 1. Station 2 has a central nurse desk surrounded by eight beds that are in line of sight. Station 4 is the end of the hallway after Station 2. It opens up to a large room with a central desk with eight beds surrounding a wide U-shaped hallway. Taking the U-shaped hallway of Station 4 all the way around will lead you to the Med Room to the left, Rapid Track, and Station 3 to the right. The Med Room is an open room with recliners typically used to give medications. Rapid Track is a row of chairs in the hallway. Station 3 has multiple “Death Beds,” rooms that are isolated and private rooms with a door, out of line of sight from the nurse’s desk. In my mind, that was the worst place to put any of these traumas, so I told the nurses to not put anybody into those rooms.</p>

<p><b>THE MCI TRIAGE PLAN<br>
</b>My plan was that we were going to take care of all of our major resuscitations (red tags) in Station 1. Station 2 was going to have our orange tags, patients with threatening gunshots in critical areas, but had not crashed yet. This is not in the textbook. In my mind, these orange tags were expected to crump near the end of the Golden Hour. Station 4 was going to have the yellow tags, patients that<span>&nbsp;</span>had torso/neck or proximal extremity shots that looked very stable and were expected to survive past the Golden Hour. Rapid Track and Med room would hold the green tags, staffed by two PAs, were just going to end up sitting on the floor or stuffed into an area with people watching over and making sure that none of them crumped. The ER doctors would resuscitate and send the resuscitated patients to Trauma 3 or 4 for the trauma surgeon to prioritize to the OR.</p>
<p>In preplanning, I knew that as we started to get some of these red tags stabilized, the anesthesiologists and surgeons would start arriving and we could open up more ORs. That’s the first major choke point. I can resuscitate four or five people, but that operating room was going to be the key to stopping the bleeding and saving lives. In a high volume penetrating MCI like this, you really need flow. You need people to get stabilized and into the operating room, not sitting around perseverating about what test to order next. Getting those ORs staffed and opened was my biggest priority. With potentially hundreds of incoming patients, it was going to be a matter of eyeballing patients or feeling for carotid pulses because we didn’t have enough monitors. Everything was 100% clinical judgment. You’re looking at all these patients, and you’re just waiting for them to declare themselves—and then you start to work on them.</p>
<p><b>THEY ARRIVED FOUR TO A CAR<br>
</b>I was out in the ambulance bay when the first police cars arrived with patients. There were three to four people inside each cruiser. Two people on the floorboards and two in the back seat, and they were in bad shape. These patients were “scoop and run”—minimal to no prior medical care but brought in a timely manner. They had thready pulses, so they went directly to Station 1, our red tag area. By textbook standards, some of these first arrivals should have been black tags, but I sent them to the red tag area anyway. I didn’t black tag a single one. We took everybody that came in—I pulled at least 10 people from cars that I knew were dead—and sent them straight back to Station 1 so that another doc could see them. If the two of us ended up thinking that this person was dead, then I knew that it was a legitimate black tag.</p><div id="polis-1039307056" data-polis-trackid="17864" data-polis-trackbid="1" data-polis-redirect="1"><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><a data-bid="1" data-no-instant="1" href="https://epmonthly.com/linkout/17864" rel="noopener sponsored" target="_blank" aria-label="26053A_300x250px"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://epmonthly.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/26053A_300x250px.gif" alt="" width="300" height="250"></a></p></div>
<p>I would pull a patient and yell “Rapid track. Station four. Station two. Station one.” The staff would then wheel the patients in gurneys or wheelchairs to those areas, drop then off, and come back for more.</p>
<p>Over the years in the ED and working with SWAT, I’ve honed what I call Applied Ballistics and Wound Estimation. It’s a visual CT scanner. We all do it as emergency physicians. You look at a GSW and guess the trajectory and the potential internal injuries. Then you decide if they’re dying now, in a few minutes, or in an hour. Instead of wasting valuable resuscitation time actually tagging the patients, they were sent to their respective tagged areas. I would look at these patients as they came in, and I would grade them red to green.</p>
<p>Some were shot in the neck or shot in the chest, but they were still awake and talking to me. These went into my orange area because I knew that I probably had 30 minutes before they crashed. Inside, the Red Tags were getting resuscitated and brought to the Trauma surgeon who would prioritize the patients to the OR. It was important to get the red tags into the operating room because the orange tags would start to crump and become the next red tags. The yellow tags would start becoming orange tags. After 30 or 40 minutes, I’d triaged the sickest group of patients I had ever seen. About 150 patients had come into the emergency department. I was pulling people five or six at a time out of patrol cars, pickup trucks, ambulances, you name it. I noticed that the first cars carried most of the red tags, and now most of the vehicles had stable yellow and green tags. At that point, one of the nurses came running out into the ambulance bay and just yelled, “Menes! You need to get inside! They’re getting behind!” I turned to Deb Bowerman, the RN who had been with me triaging and said, “You saw what I’ve been doing. Put these people in the right places.” She said, “I got it.”</p>
<p>And so I turned triage over to a nurse. The textbook says that triage should be run by the most experienced doctor, but at that point what else could we do?</p>
<p>I ran to Station 1. There were people all over the place, adhering somewhat to the triage plan. But due to the large bolus of patients, the patients overflowed into the hallways. One of the first images I can remember is Dr. Walker, Dr. Flores, and I intubating three GSWs to the head. We were in the hallway of Station 1 with the beds side by side. We were butt to butt intubating these three people. “I need etomidate! I need sux!”</p>
<p>Up until then, the nurses would go over to the Pyxis, put their finger on the scanner, and we would wait. Right then, I realized a flow issue. I needed these medications now. I turned to our ED pharmacist and asked for every vial of etomidate and succinylcholine in the hospital. I told one of the trauma nurses that we need every unit of O negative up here now. The blood bank gave us every unit they had. In order to increase the flow through the resuscitation process, nurses had Etomidate, Succinylcholine, and units of 0 negative in their pockets or nearby,</p>
<p>I realized that these GSWs to the head were going to clog up the ER. Neurosurgery had not arrived yet, and I was expecting another bolus of patients. I told the three other ER doctors that altered, isolated GSWs to the head would get intubated, sent to CT scan, then up to Trauma ICU to wait for the Neurosurgeons to arrive. This helped offload some of the volume, and it freed up our nurses to help with the orange tags that were becoming reds. As planned, all of the early red tags in Station 1 were shuffled into the operating room as our orange tags started crashing.</p>
<p><b>NO MORE THORACOSTOMY TRAYS OR VENTILATORS – TIME TO IMPROVISE<br>
</b>My partners were busy in Station 1, so I went over to Station 2. I remember intubating and dropping four chest tubes on two women in a single room, then shuffling them into Station 1 to get prioritized for the operating room. More patients started crumping in Station 2, so I started doing multiple stabilization measures. Then I sent these patients off to Station 1 for prioritization to the OR. We didn’t do any FAST or CTs on these initial red tags. We didn’t do any central lines or needle decompressions; we went straight to chest tube. If they were crumping with a GSW to the chest, they’d get a diagnostic chest tube.</p>
<p>We ran out of thoracostomy trays, so I used suture kits and scalpels. I would cut down to the ribs, pop the pleura with a needle driver or Mosquito clamp, then take the same suture kit and stitch it in place. When I ran out of chest tubes, I used an ET tube as a temporary chest tube while we waited for more supplies. We didn’t do any thorocotomies that night. That was valuable time we used to save the red and orange tag patients.</p>
<p>By this time, all the patients had bilateral IVs. As the orange tags and yellow tags would become red tags, it became very apparent that those early IVs, put in while patients still had decent veins, were lifesaving. As the patients decompensated, we had adequate access to rapidly transfuse and stabilize patients. If we didn’t have that early IV access, we would have spent valuable time trying to cannulate flat veins.</p>
<p>Eventually, the yellow tag patients in Station 4 started turning into red tags. This was later into the Golden Hour, and there were only 4 resuscitologists in the ER. I remember there were two girls who got shot in the neck, both of whom had expanding hematomas. I ended up intubating both of them. I did a chest tube on one, then moved them both to Station 1 and eventually the OR.</p>
<p>I had just stabilized those two girls, when the yellow tags started crumping down the line. The other ER docs were still working hard in Station 1. One Station 4 nurse would shout, “Menes! I need you here!” and then another would pull me to another patient. I said, “Bring all your patients together.” They brought them all towards me, and I was at the head of multiple beds, spiraling out like flower petals around its center. We pushed drugs on all of them, and they all got intubated, transfused, chest tubed, and then shuffled to&nbsp;Station 1.</p>
<p>Around that time the respiratory therapist, said, “Menes, we don’t have any more ventilators.”<span>&nbsp;</span>I said, “It’s fine,” and requested some Y tubing. Dr. Greg Neyman, a resident a year ahead of me in residency, had done a study on the use of ventilators in a mass casualty situation. What he came up with was that if you have two people who are roughly the same size and tidal volume, you can just double the tidal volume and stick them on Y tubing on one ventilator.</p>
<p><b>“YOU’RE A SHARK. GET OUT THERE AND FIND BLOOD!”<br>
</b>As fresh ER doctors would arrive, I would brief them on the layout, the list of workarounds we were doing, and tell them, “You’re a shark. Get out there and find blood!” I wanted them to find those dying patients in the sea of patients still there. Within hours, we had hundreds of doctors, nurses, and midlevels arrive at the hospital to help.</p>
<p>Around this time was my last big resuscitation, a middle-aged woman with a GSW to the lateral right chest who developed shock from a contralateral pneumothorax. She received a diagnostic left chest tube and blood, and her blood pressure stabilized. She was taken back to the OR after I secured her chest tube. She was eventually found to have a transected aorta. I heard just recently that she survived and got discharged.</p>
<p>Throughout the night, I would look up from what I was doing and scan the room to see if anyone was crumping. I noticed a choke point forming for CT. We were now left with stable yellow tags. These patients needed CAT Scans. Typically, the CT Tech picks up the patient, transfers them onto the scanner, and then they bring the patient back. These yellow tag patients were shot in the torso, but for some reason were stable even after 2 or 3 hours. I told the CT Tech, go over to the CAT scan machine, and sit behind the controls. “I don’t want you to move. You’re just going to press buttons for the rest of the night.” Then I took every nurse that was free—at that point we had a lot of extra staff—and told them that all the people who needed CAT scans needed to be lined up in the ambulance hallway outside of CAT scan. We placed monitors on them, and nurses watched them. Then the nurses assisted getting each patient on and off the CT, and then back over to Stations 2 and 4. I called it the CT Conga Line.</p>
<p>I identified another choke point with the green tag patients. Many were shot in the extremities. They had potential fractures or open fractures and needed X-rays. The standard way of doing things is taking the patient for an X-Ray, then sending it off to the radiologist so they can read it in their reading room. That was just going to take too long. So I told our CEO, Todd Sklamberg, “I need a radiologist here in the ER. I’m going to attach him to an X-Ray tech because our machines have little screens on them.” They X-Rayed patients, the radiologist read off the screen, and we would decide on disposition right there.</p>
<p>It was around four o’clock when I started trying to look at a CAT scan report. I tried to read it, but I think I burned every neurotransmitter that night. I remember looking at it and not understanding a single word that was on there. At that point, I knew I was more dangerous to the patients than helpful. These were stable yellow tags that needed a set of fresh eyes. By then, we had a lot of doctors who had arrived, so I turned that aspect of care over to them.</p>
<p><b>AFTER THE DUST SETTLED<br>
</b>When I thought about it afterwards, I realized that it was all about flow. If you eliminate these narrow choke points that occur along the way, you can get people seen and evaluated sooner by the correct specialist. As ER doctors, we can resuscitate and stabilize, but it is up to the surgeons to do damage control surgery. Prompt damage control is the key to saving somebody in a penetrating trauma.</p>
<p>In the end, we officially had 215 penetrating gunshot wounds, but the actual number is much higher. As I would circle the ER “looking for blood,” I would hear the green tags say, “You know what? I’m not that bad—I’ll be fine.” Over time, they would walk out without getting registered. Our true number was well over 250.</p>
<p>The surgery team performed an unprecedented feat that night. The numbers speak for themselves. In six hours, they did 28 damage control surgeries and 67 surgeries in the first 24 hours. We had dispositioned almost all 215 patients by about 5 o’clock in the morning, just a little more than seven hours after the ordeal began. That’s about 30 GSWs per hour. I couldn’t believe that we saved that many people in that short amount of time. It’s a testament to how amazingly well the hospital team worked together that night. We did everything we could.</p>

<ul>
<li>Flow is king. Destroy the choke points to allow patients to flow to definitive care.</li>
<li>By organizing patients into clear physical zones, they were able to avoid wasting time writing too many tags. That’s precious time that could be spent with resuscitations.</li>
<li>The Orange tag in triage allowed Menes’s team to focus on the most critically wounded while keeping a very close eye on those who were badly wounded but would soon crash.</li>
<li>Don’t have enough ventilators? Pair patients of similar size, double the tidal volume, and use Y tubing to ventilate two patients on one vent.</li>
<li>Mentally rehearse difficult scenarios ahead of time. This can be just as valuable as actual practice. Think through what you will do if/when your current plan of action fails.</li>
<li>Not enough monitors? Place all patients in line of sight, and use clinical judgment to find the crashing patients.</li>

<p>I’ve always been attracted to chording keyboards <em>in theory</em>, but I lack whatever childhood musical training is required to wrap my fingers around them.</p>
<p>So I made something else: an arpeggio keyboard.</p>
<p>Peggi is an eight-key keyboard that fits on the back of your phone. While chording keyboards require you to press multiple keys at the same time, arpeggio keyboards only ask that you type multiple keys in sequence.</p>

<p>Peggi has six “regular” keys, one space key, and one modifier key. Each finger is locked to a particular key: fingers never move across the keyboard.</p>
<p>You can type all lower-case letters and some common punctuation characters with exactly two keypresses. Upper-case letters and other symbols require three keypresses, and numbers and rarely-used symbols require holding the modifier key. Yeah, yeah, it’s sort of a chord. But like not <em>really</em>.</p>
<h2 id="try-it-for-yourself">Try it for yourself!</h2>
<p>I made a demo that preserves the same finger-key correspondence as the Peggi, but laid out across the qwerty home row. So instead of a 2x4 grid, it’s a 1x8 line. It sort of breaks my brain to type on it after using the real thing, but since you’ve never used the real thing, it should give you an okay idea of how it feels.</p>
<p>Try focusing the textarea below, and pressing the following keys on your keyboard:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>FFL KJ JL JL JF
KS A
FFK KJ FD FD DF LLL
</code></pre><p>(If you press the wrong initial key, press <code>;</code> to discard it. If you need to backspace, hold <code>;</code> and press <code>A</code>. If you’re on a phone… well, I dunno; maybe email yourself this URL and try it out later…)</p>


<p>I picture each arpeggio as a motion across a two-dimensional grid. I didn’t want to draw a fancy SVG, so content yourself with this janky table instead:</p>

<p>I bring this up because the motions “across” the keyboard feel more natural to me on the two dimensional grid than they do on the linear layout in the demo above.</p>

<p>I will also add that I think the cupped shape of the hands makes the pinky keys a lot more comfortable than the demo implies. Having the space and modifier keys on the pinkies feels fine on the Peggi, but it feels a little weird on <code>A</code> and <code>;</code>. So… withhold some judgement there, maybe.</p>
<h2 id="some-advantages-over-chording">Some advantages over chording</h2>
<ul>
<li>If you didn’t grow up playing the piano, it’s probably easier to press one key after another than to press multiple keys at the same time – you’ve been doing it all your life, on a regular keyboard.</li>
<li>Characters are entered on keydown, not on keyup, just like a traditional keyboard. This makes the keyboard feel a little more responsive – and a lot more familiar.</li>
<li>Because the order that you press keys matters, you can get by with fewer total keys. Six keys gives you 15 two-finger chords, but 30 two-finger arpeggios – enough to accommodate every letter in a commonly used alphabet.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="and-some-disadvantages">…and some disadvantages</h2>
<p>The obvious downside is that you’re submitting twice as many inputs as you would be on a chording keyboard… sort of. Typing two letters requires four keypresses, instead of two chordpresses, but you can usually begin pressing the next key before you finish pressing the previous key. Meanwhile, a chording keyboard requires you to release all keys before you can begin typing the next chord, so entering two letters on a chording keyboard is sort of four “input events” as well: keydown, keyup, keydown, keyup.</p>

<p>Another downside is that certain typos – either missing a key, or typing an extra key – can result in an entire word being mistyped: as soon as you’re “off by one,” every subsequent arpeggio you type will actually enter the wrong character. This is part of the reason why pressing space always presses space, regardless of the current sequence you’re typing: if you make a mistake, it will only last until the end of the current word.</p>
<p>I thought this would be a big problem with the design, but in practice this… almost never happens? At least at the speeds I can type at. My brain very much thinks about letters as pairs (or really as “motions” between keys), so you’d only really get off-by-one if a key press didn’t register. But because your fingers never move around, this is actually very rare.</p>
<h2 id="lets-talk-about-ergonomics">Let’s talk about ergonomics</h2>
<p>It’s not amazing.</p>
<p>I thought it was clever to put keys on the back of a phone: it leaves your thumbs free to reposition the cursor or do other navigationy things; it keeps the overall form factor relatively compact and pocket-friendly.</p>
<p>But in reality, your thumbs are kind of useless. I found that the most comfortable way to hold the phone is in landscape mode with your thumbs resting across the top edge – holding the phone such that they can actually reach the screen requires sticking the keyboard down and pinching just the corner of your screen with your palms.</p>

<p>This isn’t really as bad as it sounds. Peggi is designed for text entry; it isn’t well-suited for text editing. Occasionally making some awkward thumb contortions to move the cursor isn’t a huge deal.</p>
<p>And yeah, it really doesn’t work in portrait. I’ve tried. It’s awful.</p>

<p>Even though the photograph at the top of this post <em>showed the keyboard in portrait orientation</em>. That was a lie. That was a trick. It just photographs much better that way, because the keyboard is a little bit taller than my phone is wide, and it looks really goofy:</p>

<p>I could say that the keyboard <em>swivels</em>, so you can convert between portrait mode (so it fits in your pocket) and landscape mode (so you can actually use it), but I feel that I’ve lied enough to you already. I didn’t build a swively thing. I don’t know how. My knowledge of making physical things stops at, like, buying a USB cable.</p>
<h2 id="explain-the-key-layout-to-me">Explain the key layout to me</h2>
<p>I did not do a fancy statistical analysis to figure out what the optimal layout would be to minimize double-presses, or to maximize total comfort level given some heuristics, or anything like that.</p>
<p>I laid it out by hand, putting common letters in the most (subjectively!) comfortable positions, and trying to avoid as many double-presses as possible.</p>
<p>For example, I find it very easy to roll my fingers “up,” and comparably harder to roll them “down” – in other words, I can type <code>asdf</code> more easily than <code>fdsa</code> on a qwerty keyboard.</p>
<p>So I started by making the most common word in English – “the” – a roll of all of the fingers up, starting on the left hand and then moving to the right hand. From the home row: <code>SDFLKJ</code>. This puts <code>e</code> – the most frequent letter in English – on what is in my opinion the easiest sequence to type (<code>KJ</code> on a qwerty keyboard). From there I placed other letters according to their frequency and comfort, trying to prevent common words and bigrams from requiring double presses. And then I tweaked it a ton over time as I actually used it.</p>
<p>I won’t claim that the key layout I settled on is <em>optimal</em>, but it stopped annoying me, and at some point I had to stop tweaking so I could actually spend some time learning to use it. If you want to make your own arpeggio keyboard, I would recommend doing a bit more science to optimize the layout than I did.</p>
<h2 id="unrealistic-braggadocio-about-attainable-typing-speeds">Unrealistic braggadocio about attainable typing speeds</h2>
<p>Since the most commonly typed key is space, and it remains a single keypress, the “average” number of keypresses per character – taking capitals into account – is around 1.8.</p>
<p>I can type around 90wpm on my regular keyboard. Theoretically, that means I should be able to type around 50wpm on Peggi, because math.</p>
<p>But I also don’t have to move my fingers. Typing on Peggi is like typing exclusively from the home row, without even needing to stretch a pinky to reach for shift. So perhaps I can reach speeds even faster than 50wpm.</p>
<p>But I am also much more likely to “stall” – to have to press the same key multiple times in a row. And that’s much slower, because I can’t just press-press – I actually need to press, release, then press again. So perhaps 50wpm is optimistic.</p>
<p>Or perhaps the advantage from my fingers staying in the same place exactly counteracts the disadvantage from pressing repeat keys, and 50wpm is the correct estimate.</p>
<p>I have no idea. Let’s try an empirical measurement.</p>
<h2 id="actual-typing-speed">Actual typing speed</h2>
<p>I’m lucky if I hit 10wpm.</p>
<h2 id="the-future-of-peggi">The future of Peggi</h2>
<p>Peggi appealed to me when I lived in New York City, because I wanted a good way to write during my long commute on the subway. I actually built a prototype Peggi years ago – out of a cheap Bluetooth numpad that wasn’t reprogrammable. It only worked with a custom iOS app I wrote that listened to the individual keypress events and synthetically “typed” the corresponding letters into a <code>UITextView</code>. It was janky, but it worked, and the app also showed the key mappings that updated as I typed the first character in a sequence, which was very helpful as I tried to learn my own layout.</p>
<p>I wrote it off as an interesting experiment, partly because the numpad I used was <em>so bad</em> that it would miss half the keys I typed, and I haven’t really had an occasion to think about it since. I don’t live in New York City anymore, and I don’t really have a reason to write <em>on the go</em> these days.</p>
<p>But then I randomly stumbled across the <a href="https://www.gboards.ca/product/faunchpad">Faunchpad</a>, an eight-key macropad flashed with QMK. “My gosh,” I thought. “That would be perfect for another Peggi prototype.” So I ordered one, and wrote the firmware, and flashed it.</p>
<p>And here we are. It was a fun experiment, and it was nice to make another prototype, but I don’t think it’s really very useful – for me, at least. So my Peggi speed is probably going to stay at 10wpm, and that’s okay.</p>
<p>But I’m writing this because I think it’s an interesting idea and – while I’m sure I’m not the first to try it – I’ve never heard of any examples of keyboards like this. Maybe it will inspire you to make your own?</p>
<h2 id="hyperlinks-because-this-is-the-internet">Hyperlinks, because this is the Internet</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://gkos.com/gkos/index-gkos-com.html">GKOS</a> inspired the “put a keyboard on the back of your phone” form factor.</p>
<p>I built the Peggi out of a <a href="https://www.gboards.ca/product/faunchpad">Faunchpad that I purchased for $45 from g Heavy Industries</a>. They also sell full stenographic keyboards like the <a href="https://www.gboards.ca/product/georgi">Georgi</a>, either as kits or pre-assembled.</p>
<p>The QMK <a href="https://github.com/ianthehenry/qmk_firmware/blob/master/keyboards/peggi/keymaps/default/keymap.c">firmware for Peggi is on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://asetniop.com/">ASETNIOP</a> is a nice minimal ten-key chorded layout with stenography that you can try in your browser.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://twiddler.tekgear.com/">Twiddler</a> is a commercial one-handed chorded keyboard with built-in mouse. I’ve never <em>actually</em> used one, but the Twiddler v1 might have been the first chording keyboard I ever heard of, so it has a special place in my heart for getting me interested in the world of alternative input devices.</p></div>

                  <p>Several years ago, I worked at a company called Motif Investing that was conceptually similar this. It was marketed more as a "build your own ETF" kind of thing. You could assemble and weight up to 30 stocks in a "Motif" and manage it over time. We had some of the features you mention as well. I was happy with the product and enjoyed working their, but the business never really took off. I wish you the best in developing your company!</p>

                  <p>In regards to making a "S&amp;P - company/sector" portfolio, how can you compete with other ETF issuers? I feel like you wouldn't be able to get an expense ratio close enough to other large ETFs for the risk weighted return to overcome it. You can maintain a low expense ratio that down weights a sector by combining ETFs. But instead of having a high AUM to reduce churn, that expense is on me.</p>

                  <p>I'm JJ's brother and an investor in Double so I'm a little bit biased but I believe reducing/eliminating AUM fees is a huge net positive for the world. The performance drag over long term that money managers charge is a tax on people's retirement savings. What Vanguard/Bogle did with Index funds was massive, and I think Double can be this generation's Vanguard. Professional and powerful money management tools with rock bottom/no AUM fees is a massive opportunity. Congratulations on the launch JJ and Mark!</p>
