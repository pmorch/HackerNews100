(1-to-1 means one device for every student.) A decade later, the revolutionary optimism is fading. A </span><a href="https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/students-computers-and-learning_9789264239555-en.html" rel="">recent OECD review</a><span> found that most educational technology (EdTech) has not delivered the academic benefits once promised. Meanwhile, global test </span><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/12/cell-phones-student-test-scores-dropping/676889/" rel="">scores</a><span> in math, science, and reading have been plummeting, as you can see in Figure 1 below.

However, the impact of EdTech more broadly on student outcomes was unclear to us. Since publication, we've engaged with leading experts on the subject, and we are now publishing a series of posts to address questions that many educators, parents, and students are asking: Is EdTech actually better than traditional learning methods? When is it helpful, and when do the distraction effects overwhelm the pedagogical benefits? At what age (if any) should students start using iPads and Chromebooks in the classroom? And is the sudden proliferation of 1-to-1 devices partially responsible for the global decline in test scores over the last decade?</span></p><p><span>In the first post in our series, </span><a href="https://www.everyschool.org/" rel="">Everyschool</a><span> co-founder Amy Tyson </span><a href="https://www.afterbabel.com/p/false-promise-of-device-based-ed" rel="">addressed</a><span> five major myths about screens in school. In this post, neuroscientist and educator </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jared-cooney-horvath/" rel="">Jared Cooney Horvath</a><span> goes further, arguing that the EdTech revolution has been a failure. He explains why schools across Europe and Southeast Asia are moving away from student-facing digital technology, favoring more traditional methods—and why American schools would benefit from considering a similar shift.</span></p><p>Jared is the author of six books and over 60 research articles. Hecurrently serves as an honorary research fellow at St. Vincent’s Hospital in Melbourne and leads LME Global, a team dedicated to making the latest brain and behavioral research accessible to teachers, students, and parents. In December of last year, Jared reached out to Jon about a review article he was writing. Jon read an early draft of the article, found it to be powerful and well sourced, and invited Jared to consider publishing a shortened version of it here at After Babel. We hope you find it as thought provoking as we did.</p><p><strong>— Jon and Zach</strong></p><p><strong>p.s. </strong><span>We are looking for a variety of perspectives on this important topic.

In this major work, he analyzes over 2,100 educational meta-analyses exploring 357 different moderators affecting learning within the typical classroom. What he found was equal parts surprising and predictable: </span><em>nearly</em><span> </span><em>everything</em><span> has a positive impact on student learning. In fact, of the 357 included learning moderators, only 33 reported a negative effect size (this includes things like abuse, malnutrition, illness, and mental disorders). In other words, 91% of everything a teacher does can be said to improve learning.</span></p><p><span>Although this finding has doubtless been influenced by publication bias and the file-drawer problem, one additional practical explanation concerns </span><em><a href="https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9780203701447-9/instruction-time-task-review-lorin-anderson" rel="">engaged</a></em><a href="https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9780203701447-9/instruction-time-task-review-lorin-anderson" rel=""> </a><em><a href="https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9780203701447-9/instruction-time-task-review-lorin-anderson" rel="">time-on-task</a></em><span>.

So, when considering effect sizes within education, what is a reasonable baseline? Acknowledging that this is a tricky metric within social science, yet remains the strongest representation of quantified impact we possess within education, what effect size would constitute ‘meaningful’ improvement?</p><p><span>Data suggests that in order for students to maintain a 50th percentile rank nationwide, they must improve an average of </span><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4696502/" rel="">0.42 standard deviations</a><span> per year (calculated using standardized reading and math data across K-12); anything below this will likely lead to declining rank and vice versa. A similar analysis places this </span><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/19345740802400072" rel="">value at 0.46</a><span>, suggesting an effect size of around 0.44 would be a reasonable educational baseline. As a secondary estimate, when the effect size from all 357 moderators noted above are pooled, Hattie reports the average value sits at a less conservative </span><a href="https://visible-learning.org/hattie-ranking-influences-effect-sizes-learning-achievement/" rel="">effect size of 0.4</a><span>. In fact, he calls this a ‘hinge-point’ and recommends that only those tools and/or strategies with values </span><a href="https://www.visiblelearning.com/content/visible-learning-research" rel="">above this level</a><span> can be seen to ‘work best’ and should be considered for mass inclusion across education, as those have the greatest chance to deliver the greatest impact to the greatest number of students.</span></p><p>Using the less conservative baseline of 0.4, the aforementioned meta-analyses look much weaker. In fact, the only realm within which digital tools seem to be meaningfully beneficial is in the realm of specific learning needs (a topic we will discuss later in this piece). Use of these tools outside of this context may well be driving learning; unfortunately, that learning will be slower, less robust, and likely lead to a drop in rank compared to other, more powerful, non-digital methods.</p><p>The fact that dozens of meta-analyses comprising thousands of calculated effect sizes has done little to quell excitement over digital technology in education suggests that we may be dealing less with an issue of evidence and more with an issue of wishful thinking. So let’s step back from the data and explore why it is that digital technology in students’ hands may be doing more harm than good.</p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.afterbabel.com/p/the-edtech-revolution-has-failed?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://www.afterbabel.com/p/the-edtech-revolution-has-failed?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p><p>To understand the primary reason why digital devices make learning so difficult, we need to take a quick cognitive tangent. Rest assured, we will return to EdTech and tie this together shortly.</p><p>A commonly used phrase amongst educational researchers is, “Attention is the gateway to learning.”</p><p>Perhaps the best way to conceive of human ‘attention’ is as a filter. Much like 3-D glasses, which only allow certain wavelengths of light to reach the retinas, attention only allows relevant information to pass into conscious awareness; irrelevant information is blocked out.</p><p>What, then, determines if a particular bit of information is relevant?</p><p>Much like board games, every task we undertake comes with its own unique set of rules that dictate what actions are required for success. For instance, to successfully read these words, your ‘reading ruleset’ dictates you must move your eyes from left to right, hold each word in memory until the end of each sentence, use your fingers to scroll, etc.</p><p><span>Whenever we engage with a task, the relevant ruleset must be loaded into a small area of the brain called the </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15849898/" rel="">Lateral Prefrontal Cortex</a><span> (LatPFC). Whatever ruleset is being held within this part of the brain will ultimately determine what the attentional filter deems relevant or irrelevant.</span></p><p><span>Here's the problem: the LatPFC can only hold onto </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18558854/" rel="">one ruleset</a><span> at a time.</span></p><p><span>This means anytime we attempt to consciously undertake two tasks simultaneously, the brain simply cannot handle this; the best it can do is quickly jump back-and-forth between tasks, </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10666562/" rel="">swapping out the ruleset</a><span> within the LatPFC each time.</span></p><p>This jumping between tasks incurs three significant costs.</p><blockquote><p><em>Time</em><span>: It takes the brain about 0.15 seconds to swap out a ruleset, during which time all external information stops being consciously processed and learning slows considerably (this process is called </span><a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2002-00015-002" rel="">task-switching cost</a><span>).</span></p><p><em>Accuracy</em><span>: Whenever we jump between tasks, there is a brief period of time when the two rulesets conflict and general performance suffers (this process is called </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28104413/" rel="">cross-talk dual-task interference</a><span>).</span></p><p><em>Memory</em><span>: Memories are typically processed by a part of the brain called the hippocampus. However, when jumping between tasks, memories are more often processed </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16868087/" rel="">by the striatum</a><span> (an area of the brain linked to reflexive processes), ultimately leading to the formation of subconscious memories which are difficult to access and utilize in the future.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>In sum, </span><em>multitasking is among the worst things that students can do for learning and memory</em><span>. When we multitask, we go slower, our accuracy drops, and our learning decreases significantly.</span></p><p>Why does any of this matter?</p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.afterbabel.com/p/the-edtech-revolution-has-failed/comments&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Leave a comment&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://www.afterbabel.com/p/the-edtech-revolution-has-failed/comments" rel=""><span>Leave a comment</span></a></p><p>The primary function of any tool can be thought of as the main task or job said tool is believed to perform: or, as I often consider it, it’s the manner in which 80% of people spend 80% of their time employing said tool.&nbsp;</p><p>Consider a hammer. There are many uses for a hammer: door stop, bottle opener, back scratcher, screw driver. etc. However, 80% of people spend 80% of their time using this tool to hit things – as such, if I were to hand you a hammer, you would begin looking for something to hit.</p><p>What is the primary function of a computer?

Unfortunately, when we attempt to employ digital devices for learning purposes, this primary function quickly bleeds into student behavior.&nbsp;</p><p><span>This is why, when using a computer for homework, students typically last </span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0747563212003305" rel="">fewer than 6 minutes</a><span> before accessing social media, messaging friends, and engaging with other digital distractions. This is why, when using a laptop during class, students typically spend </span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0360131514001158" rel="">38 minutes of every hour</a><span> off-task. This is why, when getting paid as part of a research study to focus on a 20-minute computerized lesson, nearly </span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0360131511002077" rel="">40% of students</a><span> were unable to stop themselves from multitasking. It’s not that the students of today have abnormally weak constitutions; it’s that they have spent thousands of hours training themselves to use digital devices in a manner guaranteed to impair learning and performance. It’s also that many of the apps being run on those devices were carefully engineered to pull young people away from whatever they were doing.</span></p><p>Perhaps we can draw an analogy: imagine I sat a group of people around a jug of beer and asked them to use that beer to learn about buoyancy. This tool (beer) is perfectly suited to the task, and if the group of people were non-drinkers, I would expect no problem achieving my learning goals. However, if the group of people were alcoholics - individuals who had spent thousands of hours training themselves to use beer in a manner that does not concern buoyancy - then the tool would most likely hinder my learning goals.</p><p><span>And perhaps this is the key point: I’m not saying that digital technologies </span><em>can’t</em><span> be used for learning; in fact, if these tools were only ever employed for learning purposes, then they may have proven some of the most important academic inventions ever. The argument I’m making is that digital technologies so often </span><em>aren’t </em><span>used for learning that giving students a laptop, tablet, or other multi-function device places a large (and unnecessary) obstacle between the student and the desired outcome. In order to effectively learn while using an unlocked, internet-connected multi-function digital device, students must expend a great deal of cognitive effort battling impulses that they’ve spent years honing - a battle they lose more often than not. (of course schools do often try to implement blockers and restrictions, but this opens up an eternal cat-and-mouse struggle, and the mice are very good at finding ways to evade the cat.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p>To be fair, even before digital devices took over the classroom, students struggled with lack of attention, shallow thinking, overconfidence, and other learning problems. However, with digital devices, the frequency of these problems increases. Many schools were already struggling with issues of engagement, so we need to consider what additional harms may have occurred in the early 2010s when so many schools adopted tools that can be described as distraction machines.&nbsp;</p><p>Seeing as enthusiasts can’t lean on empirical data to support the adoption of student facing, internet connected digital devices across education, they frequently turn to three seemingly compelling arguments to excuse the lack of clear evidence of effectiveness. When placed in context, however, these arguments lose a lot of their exculpatory power.</p><p><span>It’s easy to get swept up in the promise of computers in education. Returning to the </span><a href="https://www.povertyactionlab.org/publication/will-technology-transform-education-better" rel="">J-PAL review</a><span> quoted earlier, after concluding that computers do not benefit learning, this group goes on to state:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>“</span><em>Computer assisted learning shows considerable promise…against this backdrop, promising uses of education technology have the potential to support massive inroads in learning</em><span>.”</span></p></blockquote><p><span>Potential is what something </span><em>could</em><span> be, what it </span><em>should</em><span> be, and what we </span><em>hope</em><span> it will be – not what it </span><em>actually</em><span> is. This means that arguments from potential do not accurately reflect reality; rather, they reflect the faith, belief, and desires of the speaker. In fact, when people say that computers have the potential to drive student learning, they are tacitly acknowledging that these tools are not currently achieving this aim.</span></p><p>I am not arguing against having hope for EdTech; there is a good chance that somebody will someday create a program that outshines even the best teachers in the world. I am simply pointing out that this has not yet happened, and that promissory arguments are not a solid enough foundation upon which to change educational practice at&nbsp; mass scale.</p><p>Health insurance. Taxes. Video games. Dating, marriage, and divorce. Mortgages. Laundry. Student loans. Litigation. Self-defense. First aid. Pet care. Superannuation. Yoga.</p><p>I mention these things to highlight that just because something is ubiquitous does not mean it needs to be explicitly taught in school. Teachers have long recognized that they are not alone in the journey of education, and that many essential concepts are meant to be passed along by parents, peers, society, and life experience.</p><p><span>With that said, an argument could be made that schools </span><em>should</em><span> be teaching these ubiquitous subjects; that it’s the responsibility of education to ensure all students are well versed in those things they are certain to encounter in their adult lives.&nbsp;</span></p><p>I think this argument has some merit.</p><p><span>However, to argue that a topic </span><em>should be taught</em><span> is far different than arguing that all things should be taught </span><em>through that topic</em><span>. The former is an argument about curriculum; the latter is an argument about pedagogy. For instance, you might believe we should teach table manners to students (curriculum), but that’s different than arguing we should teach all classes in a dining room over dinner (pedagogy).&nbsp; Determining </span><em>what </em><span>to teach and </span><em>how </em><span>to teach are two very different considerations.</span></p><p><span>Here is where the excuse from ubiquity goes awry. Through some linguistic alchemy, the argument “we should teach computer skills” has morphed into “we should teach all skills through a computer.” Teachers around the world are being asked by </span><a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2021-01-21-jeff-bezos-wants-to-go-to-the-moon-then-public-education" rel="">developers</a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/05/nyregion/banks-migrants-nyc-schools.html" rel="">politicians</a><span>, and their own </span><a href="https://www.edweek.org/technology/why-principals-are-embracing-personalized-learning/2018/04" rel="">principals </a><span>to adopt digital technologies within their classroom, even if these tools aren’t well suited to the learning goals these teachers desire.</span></p><p><span>Although teaching computer processes, coding skills, and digital etiquette are </span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0747563217302510#:~:text=It%20finds%20that%20computer%20skills%20not%20only%20mitigate%20worker%20displacement,to%20other%20types%20of%20jobs." rel="">worthwhile goals</a><span> (curriculum), it does not follow that we must reconfigure all academic subjects to achieve this goal. When it comes to effective teaching and learning (pedagogy), we should select the tool best suited to the job; not the tool that is most prevalent. Just as power tools are confined to the woodshop and Bunsen burners are confined to the science lab, perhaps student-facing digital devices should be confined to a dedicated computer lab within school; they should not be freely available whenever and wherever. Or perhaps devices should be disconnected from the internet and/or locked using an LMS system that only allows for specific programs to be employed.&nbsp; Employing mediated devices or a singular location may ensure that teachers choosing to employ tech have a clear reason for doing so, and students choosing to employ tech have oversight and less opportunity for detrimental multitasking.</span></p><p><span>As referenced earlier, following a three-year analysis of hundreds of thousands of data points and concluding that computers significantly reduce learning, the </span><a href="https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/students-computers-and-learning_9789264239555-en.html" rel="">OECD report went on to state</a><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>“</span><em>One interpretation of all this is that building deep, conceptual understanding and higher-order thinking requires intensive teacher-student interaction…Another interpretation is that we have not yet become good enough at the kind of pedagogies that make the most of technology.</em><span>”</span></p></blockquote><p><span>In the interest of digging deeper, let’s give this excuse the benefit of the doubt. If computers are in fact being used incorrectly in schools, then what is the correct way to use them? As </span><a href="https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/students-computers-and-learning_9789264239555-en.html" rel="">the OECD report states</a><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>“[Digital technology] is linked to better student performance…when computer software and internet connections help to increase study time and practice.”</em></p></blockquote><p>In case you missed it, let me rephrase that: learning improves when students spend more time learning.&nbsp;</p><p>This revelation is not unique to computers. Flashcards, workbooks, an empty milk jug, my great aunt Justine… as the work of John Hattie mentioned above reveals, when used to increase study time and practice, literally any tool will improve student performance. The relevant question is whether or not computers and tablets actually do lead to increased learning time. Unfortunately, as we’ve already established, the answer to this seems to be ‘no,’ they are at least as likely to increase time spent on video games, video watching, social media, and listening to music.</p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.afterbabel.com/p/the-edtech-revolution-has-failed?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://www.afterbabel.com/p/the-edtech-revolution-has-failed?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p><p>While I am generally critical of the way that EdTech has been put into the hands of students, I do see two ways in which digital technologies can be extremely helpful for teachers and for students. The first concerns teaching. When digital tools are used and controlled by a well-trained teacher to drive pedagogy, then any problems of multitasking and distraction that occur due to student-facing digital technologies can be averted.</p><p><span>However, simply asking teachers to employ computers in their teaching will not, in itself, boost learning. It is essential that teachers continue to select the strongest pedagogical techniques, regardless of whichever tool they choose to employ. For instance, employing PowerPoint slides during a didactic lesson has sometimes been found to </span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0360131512000140" rel="">impair the amount</a><span> of </span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0360131508002017" rel="">verbal information</a><span> students retain. Again, this is not due to the tool itself; rather, it is determined by the way in which teachers choose to use this tool.</span></p><p>In the words of the great media scholar Neil Postman, “I do not say that [digital technologies], when used properly by a skilled teacher, will not help [learning], but I doubt that it can do better than pencil and paper, or speech itself, when used properly by a skilled teacher.” In other words, digital tools do not obviate the need for sound pedagogy; and sound pedagogy will rarely be dependent upon digital tools.</p><p>The second instance where EdTech may be helpful concerns issues of learning abatement. For instance, if learning is abated due to school closures necessitated by environmental disasters (e.g. poor air quality from fires), sociological upheavals (e.g. violent political protests), or health risks (e.g. local epidemics or global pandemics), then it’s worthwhile to employ digital technology as a solution.</p><p><span>With that said, issues of digital distraction, diminished impact, and socioeconomic divide persist or increase during these forms of digital-based distance education. In fact, in a </span><a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/19/18/11188" rel="">recent survey</a><span>, 95% of students admit to media multitasking during distance learning,&nbsp; with 15% admitting going off-task over 30 times per session.</span></p><p>As another example, if learning is abated due deafness, blindness, orthopedic, or other forms of specific learning disabilities that preclude students from engaging with non-digital learning materials, then it’s worthwhile to employ digital technology as a solution.</p><p>In the end, if there is no other avenue or option for engaging with learning material besides digital technology, then we are well justified in employing it. However, if there are two or more options for engaging with learning material, then it is best to select the tool that will yield the best results. As we’ve seen, that tool will rarely be digital in nature.</p><p>Enough.</p><p><span>As mentioned above, we are seeing a shift away from digital reliance in schools across many </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/sep/09/dutch-school-that-banned-mobile-phones-calvijn-college#:~:text=From%20the%20moment%20they%20began,after%20the%20ban%20was%20enacted." rel="">european</a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/fast-growth-digital-technology-challenging-education-priorities-and-practices-south-east-asia#:~:text=A%20campaign%20%23TechOnOurTerms%20alongside%20the,discontinued%20due%20to%20implementation%20challenges." rel="">southeast asian</a><span> countries, not just Sweden. I urge readers to take these shifts seriously and look closely at emerging data in schools that reduce their use of EdTech. If the educational and cognitive research that I have discussed is accurate, then we should see not only improvements in student learning, but also improvements in student relationships, mental health, and physical wellbeing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p></div></div>]]></description>

            <p>There’s no doubt that exercise does a body good. Regular activity not only strengthens muscles but can bolster our bones, blood vessels, and immune system.</p><p>Now, MIT engineers have found that exercise can also have benefits at the level of individual neurons. They observed that when muscles contract during exercise, they release a soup of biochemical signals called myokines. In the presence of these muscle-generated signals, neurons grew four times farther compared to neurons that were not exposed to myokines. These cellular-level experiments suggest that exercise can have a significant biochemical effect on nerve growth.</p><p>Surprisingly, the researchers also found that neurons respond not only to the biochemical signals of exercise but also to its physical impacts. The team observed that when neurons are repeatedly pulled back and forth, similarly to how muscles contract and expand during exercise, the neurons grow just as much as when they are exposed to a muscle’s myokines.</p><p>While previous studies have indicated a potential biochemical link between muscle activity and nerve growth, this study is the first to show that physical effects can be just as important, the researchers say.&nbsp;The results, which are <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adhm.202403712" target="_blank">published today in the journal <em>Advanced Healthcare Materials</em></a>, shed light on the connection between muscles and nerves during exercise, and could inform exercise-related therapies for repairing damaged and deteriorating nerves.</p><p>“Now that we know this muscle-nerve crosstalk exists, it can be useful for treating things like nerve injury, where communication between nerve and muscle is cut off,” says Ritu Raman, the Eugene Bell Career Development Assistant Professor of Mechanical Engineering at MIT. “Maybe if we stimulate the muscle, we could encourage the nerve to heal, and restore mobility to those who have&nbsp;lost it due to traumatic injury or neurodegenerative diseases.”</p><p>Raman is the senior author of the new study, which includes Angel Bu, Ferdows Afghah, Nicolas Castro, Maheera Bawa, Sonika Kohli, Karina Shah, and Brandon Rios of MIT’s Department of Mechanical Engineering, and Vincent Butty of MIT’s Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research.</p><p><strong>Muscle talk</strong></p><p>In 2023, Raman and her colleagues&nbsp;<a href="https://news.mit.edu/2023/light-activated-muscle-grafts-show-promise-aiding-muscle-recovery-post-trauma-1030" target="_blank">reported</a> that they could restore mobility in mice that had experienced a traumatic muscle injury, by first implanting muscle tissue at the site of injury, then exercising the new tissue by stimulating it repeatedly with light. Over time, they found that the exercised graft helped mice to regain their motor function, reaching activity levels comparable to those of healthy mice.</p><p>When the researchers analyzed the graft itself, it appeared that regular exercise stimulated the grafted muscle to produce certain biochemical signals that are known to promote nerve and blood vessel growth.</p><p>“That was interesting because we always think that nerves control muscle, but we don’t think of muscles talking back to nerves,” Raman says. “So, we started to think stimulating muscle was encouraging nerve growth. And people replied that maybe that’s the case, but there’s hundreds of other cell types in an animal, and it’s really hard to prove that the nerve is growing more because of the muscle, rather than the immune system or something else playing a role.”</p><p>In their new study, the team set out to determine whether exercising muscles has any direct effect on how nerves grow, by focusing solely on muscle and nerve tissue. The researchers grew mouse muscle cells into long fibers that then fused to form a small sheet of mature muscle tissue about the size of a quarter.</p><p>The team genetically modified the muscle to contract in response to light. With this modification, the team could flash a light repeatedly, causing the muscle to squeeze in response, in a way that mimicked the act of exercise. Raman previously developed a novel&nbsp;<a href="https://news.mit.edu/2023/wobbly-gel-mat-trains-muscle-cells-work-together-1020" target="_blank">gel mat</a> on which to grow and exercise muscle tissue. The gel’s properties are such that it can support muscle tissue and prevent it from peeling away as the researchers stimulated the muscle to exercise.</p><p>The team then collected samples of the surrounding solution in which the muscle tissue was exercised, thinking that the solution should hold myokines, including growth factors, RNA, and a mix of other proteins.</p><p>“I would think of myokines as a biochemical soup of things that muscles secrete, some of which could be good for nerves and others that might have nothing to do with nerves,” Raman says. “Muscles are pretty much always secreting myokines, but when you exercise them, they make more.”</p><p><strong>“Exercise as medicine”</strong></p><p>The team transferred the myokine solution to a separate dish containing motor neurons — nerves found in the spinal cord that control muscles involved in voluntary movement. The researchers grew the neurons from stem cells derived from mice. As with the muscle tissue, the neurons were grown on a similar gel mat. After the neurons were exposed to the myokine mixture, the team observed that they quickly began to grow, four times faster than neurons that did not receive the biochemical solution.</p>

            MIT scientists find that motor neuron growth increased significantly over 5 days in response to biochemical and mechanical signals related to exercise. The green ball represents cluster of neurons that grow outward in long tails, or axons.

            <p>“They grow much farther and faster, and the effect is pretty immediate,” Raman notes.</p><p>For a closer look at how neurons changed in response to the exercise-induced myokines, the team ran a genetic analysis, extracting RNA from the neurons to see whether the myokines induced any change in the expression of certain neuronal genes.</p><p>“We saw that many of the genes up-regulated in the exercise-stimulated neurons was not only related to neuron growth, but also neuron maturation, how well they talk to muscles and other nerves, and how mature the axons are,” Raman says. “Exercise seems to impact not just neuron growth but also how mature and well-functioning they are.”</p><p>The results suggest that biochemical effects of exercise can promote neuron growth. Then the group wondered: Could exercise’s purely physical impacts have a similar benefit?</p><p>“Neurons are physically attached to muscles, so they are also stretching and moving with the muscle,” Raman says. “We also wanted to see, even in the absence of biochemical cues from muscle, could we stretch the neurons back and forth, mimicking the mechanical forces (of exercise), and could that have an impact on growth as well?”</p><p>To answer this, the researchers grew a different set of motor neurons on a gel mat that they embedded with tiny magnets. They then used an external magnet to jiggle the mat — and the neurons — back and forth. In this way, they “exercised” the neurons, for 30 minutes a day. To their surprise, they found that this mechanical exercise stimulated the neurons to grow just as much as the myokine-induced neurons, growing significantly farther than neurons that received no form of exercise.</p><p>“That’s a good sign because it tells us both biochemical and physical effects of exercise are equally important,” Raman says.</p><p>Now that the group has shown that exercising muscle can promote nerve growth at the cellular level, they plan to study how targeted muscle stimulation can be used to grow and heal damaged nerves, and restore mobility for people who are living with a neurodegenerative disease such as ALS.</p><p>“This is just our first step toward understanding and controlling exercise as medicine,” Raman says.&nbsp;</p>

The “majority” of the new users on the decentralized social network are from the US, Wang says. The app is currently the number two free social networking app in the US App Store, only trailing Meta’s Threads.</p><div><p>People posting on Threads, on the other hand, have raised complaints about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/7/24264382/threads-engagement-bait-problem-mosseri-meta">engagement bait</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/11/24267898/mosseri-acknowledges-mistakes-threads-instagram-broken-moderation">moderation issues</a>, and, as of late, misinformation, <a href="https://www.usermag.co/p/metas-threads-overrun-with-liberal-election-fraud-conspiracies">reports Taylor Lorenz</a>. And like our very own <a href="https://www.threads.net/@tomwarrenuk/post/DCL59cZNuBt">Tom Warren</a>, I’ve come to dislike the algorithmic “For You” feed that you <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/25/23807340/threads-following-feed-for-you-default-instagram-meta">can’t permanently escape</a>, and it certainly seems like we’re not alone in that opinion.</p></div><p>But the Instagram-bootstrapped Threads, which recently crossed <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/30/24284013/threads-hits-275-million-users">275 million monthly users</a>, is still significantly larger than Bluesky.</p><p>The independent platform has seen a lot of growth in recent weeks — on October 24th, Bluesky announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/24/24278666/bluesky-working-on-premium-subscription">it had 13 million users</a>. After X’s recent announcement that it would let blocked users still see posts from the person that blocked them, for example, Bluesky said it added <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/18/24273435/bluesky-user-spike-x-tos-ai-changes-blocking">500,000 new users <em>in one day</em></a>.</p><p>The results of the US presidential election could be part of Bluesky’s new influx of users. People may be looking to use a platform that’s not owned by Musk or, like <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/taylor-swift-fans-leaving-x-following-trumps-election/">some Taylor Swift fans</a>, may be looking for a new platform following <a href="https://www.isdglobal.org/digital_dispatches/your-body-my-choice-hate-and-harassment-towards-women-spreads-online/">an increase in hate speech on X</a>.</p><div><p>Bluesky is also becoming an increasingly better app, with recently added features like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/11/24267678/bluesky-app-update-pinned-posts-font-size-threads-pitch">pinned posts</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/11/24241994/bluesky-share-videos-update">support for posting videos</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/22/24162749/bluesky-send-direct-messages">the ability to send DMs</a> to bring it up to what you might expect from X.

<p><img src="https://www.scannedinavian.com/images/holastafur.png"></p>
<p>This blog post was written together with <a href="https://mclare.blog/">&lt;mclare&gt;</a>, who made coooool visualizations like the picture at the end of the post!</p>
<h2 id="whats-a-bus-factor-or-truck-factor">What’s a Bus Factor or Truck Factor?</h2>
<p>According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor">wikipedia</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The “bus factor” is the minimum number of team members that have to suddenly disappear from a project before the project stalls due to lack of knowledgeable or competent personnel.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>
<p>In 2015 or so, my employer had layoffs.
One of them was the only contributor to part of the codebase that made money for our company.
I remembered reading about <a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?TruckNumber">Truck Number</a> on the original wiki, so I thought it’d be fun to write a github enterprise plugin that calculates who you can’t afford to fire.
I enjoy reading research papers, and found this <a href="http://aserg.labsoft.dcc.ufmg.br/truckfactor/">truck factor</a> research paper.</p>
<p>I started writing the plugin, and talked five minutes on it at our Thursday afternoon lightning talks.
My coworkers said it would immediately hit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law">Goodhart’s Law</a>. They saw this as a way for management to easily calculate who you <strong>can</strong> fire!</p>
<h2 id="what">What?</h2>
<p>The original authors calculated how many people had to be hit by a bus for a bunch of popular GitHub projects to stall.
This includes the Linux kernel among others. In the first preprint, they said 80 people would have to leave the project for Linux to stop.</p>
<p>Last week I mentioned this blog post idea to mclare, and she said we should try to reproduce the results and see if the truck factor has improved in the past ten years.</p>
<p>The authors’ <a href="https://github.com/aserg-ufmg/Truck-Factor">github repo</a> is available and still works!</p>
<h2 id="are-we-able-to-reproduce-the-results">Are we able to reproduce the results?</h2>
<p>The Truck Factor research paper links to a <a href="https://github.com/aserg-ufmg/Truck-Factor">github repository</a>!
The data from the paper is available as JSON!
Their <a href="http://aserg.labsoft.dcc.ufmg.br/truckfactor/target.html">visualization</a> is backed by a CSV we can scrape!</p>
<p>But, we don’t know the <strong>date</strong> they pulled the data.</p>
<p>The README instructions don’t quite work, and we spent an hour figuring out how to execute the pieces.
Fortunately, the issues on the github repository told us how to fix the problem. I wanted results, not an afternoon of debugging their use of awk in shell scripts.
mclare got the list of github repos out of the first column of their CSV. We needed to clone them all!
We had fun learning about <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/">gnu parallel</a> to run a bunch of git clone commands at the same time.</p>
<h3 id="gnu-parallel">Gnu Parallel</h3>
<p>Why does <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/">gnu parallel</a> use <strong>all</strong> the cores when we tell it to use only 8?
We only saw eight <code>git clone</code> processes at a time, but a large number of <code>git index-pack</code> processes that maxed out all 32 cores on my laptop.
I’m guessing git’s index-pack is a forked subprocess and allows parallel to start another git clone?
If you know the answer, send us a message!</p>
<h3 id="ruby-gems-in-nixos">Ruby Gems in NixOS</h3>
<p>The Truck Factor code uses <a href="https://github.com/github-linguist/linguist">linguist</a> to filter out files that are only documentation. Later in the paper the authors say that documentation is the best way to keep your project alive, so I’m not convinced that’s good.</p>
<p>In any case, I’m running NixOS and have no experience with Ruby, thus installing Ruby Gems did not fit in the time I had.
If you know a good way to install the linguist plugin in a Nix flake, please send me a message! (or even a <a href="https://github.com/spite-driven-development/Truck-Factor">pull request</a>)</p>
<h2 id="but-how-did-you-recalculate-the-results">But, <strong>how</strong> did you recalculate the results?</h2>
<p>We forked the original repository on github, cloned it locally, and puzzled our way through the README.
We used <code>mvn package</code> to compile the Java source into a jar, and tried each of the steps on the numpy github repository.
Then we were ready to recalculate all the things.</p>
<p>mclare downloaded the CSV from the authors’ <a href="http://aserg.labsoft.dcc.ufmg.br/truckfactor/target.html">visualization</a> and we converted the first column into a <a href="https://github.com/spite-driven-development/Truck-Factor/blob/master/meta/repo_list.txt">list of github repositories</a>.
I started with a for loop, but mclare switched to gnu parallel, because it’s cool. Also because everything gets done faster.</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><span># clone the repositories</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2"><span>parallel</span> <span>-j</span> 8 git clone ::: <span>$(</span><span>cat</span> ../meta/repo_list.txt<span>)</span></span>
<span id="cb1-3"><span># change into the directory so you don't get the awk error</span></span>
<span id="cb1-4"><span>cd</span> gittruckfactor/scripts</span>
<span id="cb1-5"><span># scrape out all the git commit info</span></span>

<p>I have a fast gigabit internet connection at home, it took 17.5 minutes to clone all the repos one at a time.
Processing each repo took about the same time, eighteen minutes maybe?</p>
<p>Here’s one example output for the linux kernel repository:</p>

<li><label>why is our number for Linux so very different ten years later? The original paper gives a truck factor of 80, we get EIGHT!</label>
<ul>
<li><label>The original paper uses a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance">Levenshtein distance</a> of one to find and merge developer aliases. I don’t think we did that. Maybe that changes our number?</label></li>
<li><label>Would this version of the truck factor code still give us 80 if we checkout the Linux kernel repo at mid-2015 ? According to the git history, the algorithm was updated in 2016, could we get new numbers for a later blog post?</label></li>
</ul></li>
<li><label>We could look at some of the <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=5286537198548981618&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0,22">156 citations</a> of this paper and see if someone came up with a better calculation.</label></li>
<li><label>We could compare popular projects of today to their history. Rust and other recent big names are not mentioned in the 2015 paper. For that matter, we could write a script to find yearly truck numbers for any git repo.</label></li>
<li><label>Shae wants to figure out how to install Ruby Gems in NixOS so the linguist plugin can filter out which files are only documentation.</label></li>

<h2 id="conclusion---bus-factors-got-scarier">Conclusion - Bus Factors got scarier.</h2>
<p>The biggest question we both had was, did it get any better?</p>
<p>I’m gonna say no, it’s gotten worse.
The 2015 <a href="https://peerj.com/preprints/1233v1.pdf">preprint</a> of this paper gave the linux kernel a truck factor of ninety!
The <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.06766">full publication</a> gave that same repository a truck number of fifty seven.</p>
<p>Without the linguist plugin to filter out documentation and third party libraries, we got a truck factor of twelve for the Linux kernel repository.
After mclare installed the plugin on her system, she got a truck factor of eight for the Linux kernel.</p>
<p>This is not an improvement.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the replies.<br>
The Macbook is a 2010 17" so it would have been pretty easy to upgrade and repair (socketed Ram and HDD, screwed in battery) but the age would have made this laptop not only unusably slow but it was also dead as a doornail. Its one of the still good Macbooks with the glowing apple logo.<br>
Yes, all the green PCBs are made by me.</p>

            <p>Sorry it isn’t quite clear to me, is that additional fan adding to the existing cpu cooling solution because you saw overheating or to get the most thermal performance?</p>

            <p>Yes its adding to the existing cpu cooling. The first prototype of this I build was using an i5 1135 cpu and was getting pretty hot. So I figured adding an additional heatsink and fan would help. On the Ryzen board im not sure I would have gone through that trouble again, its running much cooler.</p>

            <p>If you dont add a second cooling fan I dont think that would be an issue on the 15 inch. The 13 might be difficult to fit the battery but I think it would be possible.</p>

							<p>Apple apparently hasn’t learned much from the criticism it took earlier this year for an ad showing creative works unceremoniously crushed in an industrial press (see “<a href="https://tidbits.com/2024/05/10/apple-apologizes-for-tone-deaf-crush-ipad-pro-ad/">Apple Apologizes for Tone-Deaf “Crush!” iPad Pro Ad</a>,” 10 May 2024). A pair of new ads for Apple Intelligence portray the Writing Tools and Memories movies as tools for those unwilling to put in any effort.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3m0MoYKwVTM">first ad</a>, Apple Intelligence enables a goof-off who wastes time and annoys his colleagues to surprise his boss with an unexpectedly well-written email. It’s not clear that the boss is impressed; he just can’t believe the guy would have written a professional message.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Apple Intelligence | Writing Tools | iPhone 16" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3m0MoYKwVTM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Is the message that Apple Intelligence is aimed at the perpetually lazy? Where’s the positive ad with a dyslexic child using Writing Tools to proofread a school essay or a businessperson using it to understand a complex report dumped on them minutes before a meeting?</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0BXZhdDqZM">second ad</a> channels a similar suggestion—that Apple Intelligence is a crutch for the thoughtless. In it, a woman realizes that she has forgotten her husband’s birthday only after their kids give him thoughtful, homemade gifts, so she quickly uses Apple Intelligence to create a Memories movie of the children doing woodworking with their father. Apple Intelligence to the rescue! Apparently, making a Memories movie is easier than creating a repeating annual calendar event.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Apple Intelligence | Create memory movies | iPhone 16" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A0BXZhdDqZM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Why would Apple want to promote the idea that Apple Intelligence can bail you out from failing to pay attention to the most important people in your life? It’s trivially easy to imagine positive scenarios enhanced by a Memories movie, such as a teen sharing photos with an ailing grandparent in the hospital or high school friends reconnecting over shared sports photos. They might be a touch cloying, but Memories movies trend in that direction anyway.</p>
<p>As it stands now, and likely as it will be in its next release, Apple Intelligence won’t change the world or even your everyday Mac experience. But it can make a difference for some, and Apple would be better served by showing it helping those who are already trying to do good work and be good people.</p>
<p>Imagine you work at Apple’s ad agency. What ads would you like to see showcasing Apple Intelligence features?</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><header></header><section><p>I have shipped a lot of different projects over the last ~10 years in tech. I often get tapped to lead new ones when it’s important to get it right, because I’m good at it. Shipping in a big tech company is a very different skill to writing code, and lots of people who are great at writing code are terrible at shipping.</p>
<p>Here’s what I think about when I’m leading a project and what I’ve seen people get wrong.</p>
<h2>Shipping is hard</h2>
<p>The most common error I see is to assume that shipping is easy. The default state of a project is to <em>not ship</em>: to be delayed indefinitely, cancelled, or to go out half-baked and burst into flames. Projects do not ship automatically once all the code has been written or all the Jira tickets closed. They ship because someone takes up the difficult and delicate job of shipping them.</p>
<p>That means that in almost all cases, <strong>shipping has to come first</strong>. You cannot have anything else as your top priority. If you spend all your time worrying about polishing the customer experience (for example), you will not ship! Obsessing over UX is praiseworthy behaviour when you are an engineer on the team, but a blunder if you are leading the project. You should cherish the other engineers on your team who are doing that work, and give them as much support as you can. But your primary concern has to be shipping the project. It is too hard a job to do in your spare time.</p>
<p>In my experience, projects almost always ship because one single person makes them ship. To be clear, that person doesn’t write all the code or do all the work, and I’m not saying the project could ship without an entire team behind it. But it’s <em>really important</em> that one person on the project has an end-to-end understanding of the whole thing: how it hangs together technically, and what product or business purpose it serves. Good teams and companies understand this, and make sure every project has a single responsible engineer (typically this position is called a “technical lead” or “DRI” role). Bad teams and companies don’t do this, and projects live and die based on whether an engineer steps up into this role of their own accord.</p>
<h2>What is shipping?</h2>
<p>Why do so many engineers think shipping is easy? I know it sounds extreme, but I think many engineers do not understand what shipping even is inside a large tech company. What does it mean to ship? It does <em>not</em> mean deploying code or even making a feature available to users. Shipping is a social construct within a company.Concretely, that means that <strong>a project is shipped when the important people at your company believe it is shipped.</strong> If you deploy your system, but your manager or VP or CEO is very unhappy with it, <em>you did not ship</em>. (Maybe you shipped something, but you didn’t ship the actual project.) You only know you’ve shipped when your company’s leadership acknowledge you’ve shipped. A congratulations message in Slack from your VP is a good sign, as is an internal blog post that claims victory. For small ships, an atta-boy from your manager will do.</p>
<p>This probably sounds circular, but I think it’s a really important point. Of course if you deploy something that users love and makes a ton of money, you’ve shipped. But that’s only true because satisfying users and making money is something that makes your leadership team happy. If you ship something users hate and makes no money, but your leadership team is happy, <em>you still shipped</em>. You can feel any way you like about that, but it’s true. If you don’t like it, you should probably go work for companies that really care how happy their users are.</p>
<p>Engineers who think shipping means delivering a spec or deploying code will repeatedly engineer their way into failed ships.</p>
<h2>Communication</h2>
<p>So if your primary job when shipping something is to make your company’s leadership happy with the project, what does that mean in practice? First, <strong>you have to get clear on what the company is looking to get out of the project</strong>. Sometimes it’s extracting more money from a small set of users (e.g. enterprise features). Sometimes it’s spending money to grow the total set of users (e.g. splashy free-tier features). Sometimes it’s mollifying a particular very large customer by building a feature specifically for them. Sometimes it’s just an influential VP or CEO’s pet project, and you need to align with their vision. There are lots of potential reasons, and if you want to ship the project you need to know which ones apply in this case. Align your work and communication accordingly! For instance, enterprise features often don’t need splashy UI but are completely inflexible on requirements, end-user features need to be polished, pet projects mean you need to be in active communication with the specific mover and shaker whose pet it is, and so on.</p>
<p>Second, no matter the project goal, your leadership team (the people in your reporting chain who care about the project) will always have basically zero technical context about the project compared to you. That means they will be trusting you for estimates, to answer technical questions, and to anticipate technical problems. <strong>Maintaining that trust should be your top priority</strong>. If they don’t have faith in your ability to do the job and to keep them informed, you will not ship. They’ll de-risk by cancelling the project, or letting it roll out with zero attention or celebration (remember that an un-celebrated launch is not a ship!) Alternatively, they’ll sideline you and go to another engineer, who will then formally or informally be the one who actually ships the project. Either way, you’ll feel it at review time and they’ll go to someone else for the next one.</p>
<p>How do you maintain trust with your leadership team? This could be a whole article (or book) by itself, but here’s my summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>The best thing is a track record of having shipped in the past, if you can get it</li>
<li>Project confidence (if you’re visibly worried, they will be too)</li>
<li>Project competence. You want to aim for something like a NASA mission control vibe</li>
<li>Communicate professionally and concisely, and don’t make them chase you for updates: post a daily or weekly thread somewhere</li>
</ul>
<p>It is much, much more important to do these things than for the project to ship with zero bugs on the exact deadline. If a project has to be delayed for technical reasons, in my experience you will not suffer consequences so long as you communicate it clearly, confidently (and ideally with some warning). In fact, it’s paradoxically often <em>better</em> for you if there is some kind of problem that forces a delay, for the same reason that the heroic on-call engineer who hotfixes an incident gets more credit than the careful engineer who prevents one.</p>
<h2>Getting into production</h2>
<p>Even so, you typically still have to get the project into production. The most common problem here is missing a key detail. Sometimes it’s a technical detail: maybe we rely on storing the user documents in Memcached, but many documents are multiple megabytes and will be larger than the Memcached block size. Sometimes it’s a detail of coordination: maybe the platform team that owns Memcached was expecting one-tenth of the traffic our project will send them, so they call a meeting with the VPs and delay the project. Sometimes it’s a legal detail: maybe the user data is unexpectedly sensitive, and our system doesn’t have the controls we’d need to handle it safely. These issues can come from anywhere, and are very hard to anticipate. Dealing with them requires a deep technical understanding of the system and the ability to pivot quickly.</p>
<p>For instance, you may have read that first example and are now thinking “well, you could split the documents across multiple Memcached keys, or increase the block size, or move to Redis, etc…“. All of those are potential solutions! But knowing which of those solutions will work - and more importantly, which of those solutions will not blow out the project timeline - is impossible unless you’ve got a deep understanding.</p>
<p>This is doubly important because the problem in question doesn’t even need to be real. In the lead up to a project launch, it’s very common for other teams or engineers to raise <em>potential</em> problems (e.g. “hey, are we sure the user data will fit in Memcached?“) If nobody steps forward and explains why this isn’t a problem (or if it is, how it’s being addressed before launch), the project will be delayed, and it will be your responsibility. Why? Because your manager (or their manager) will not know whether this is a serious problem. That’s what they pay you for! If you’re not stepping up to address it, they will naturally err on the side of caution and <em>not ship</em>.</p>
<p>You need to stay light on your feet so that when these issues come up you’re not neck-deep in other work. That usually means not being fully heads-down on implementation (i.e. delegating tasks to other engineers on the project). Ideally you should have at least 20% of your time free from implementation in the early stages of the project, scaling up to 90-100% in the final days. If you do that, when issues do come up you’ll be able to grant them your full attention.</p>
<h2>Can we ship right now?</h2>
<p>Feature flags are the best way I’ve seen to do this, but staging environments also work, and so on. The key thing is to get whatever you’re building in front of as many eyes as possible: yours, but also other engineers, and ideally leadership, product, design and so on. Five minutes playing with the actual feature, even in a very rough state, will bring up issues that nobody anticipated. Being able to directly see it themselves also does wonders for reassuring leadership that you’ve got things under control.</p>
<p>The best way to anticipate problems is to deploy early. In general, a helpful question to ask is <strong>can I ship this right now?</strong> Not this week, not today: right this second. If not, what would have to change for me to be able to ship <em>something</em>? If the ship needs a deploy, can that happen now behind a feature flag? If we’re waiting on some other team to make a change on their end, can I make it so the system doesn’t strictly require their change after all? For instance, if the platform team is setting up a cache layer, I could make it so my feature still works (albeit a little slower) if it can’t find the cache.</p>
<p>Remember, your main priority is maintaining trust with your leadership team. Nothing builds trust like having fallback plans, because in case of emergency fallback plans indicate control over the situation. If the worst does happen and you can’t release on the day, your manager will be much happier going to their manager about it if they can say something like “our options are to delay four days, or ship tomorrow by sacrificing X” - even if sacrificing X is a non-starter. That means they’ll be more likely to interpret the delay as an unavoidable problem that you handled effectively, instead of as a mistake you made that means they can’t rely on you.</p>
<p>I think a lot of engineers hold off on deploys essentially out of fear. If you want to ship, you need to do the exact opposite: you need to deploy as much as you can as early as possible, and you need to do the scariest changes as early as you can possibly do them. Remember that you have the most end-to-end context on the project, which means <strong>you should be the least scared of scary changes</strong>. Everyone else is dealing with more unknowns and is going to be even less keen to pull the big lever. (If there’s some other engineer who is across all of this who you’re waiting for, bad news: they’re probably the one actually shipping your project).</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<ul>
<li>Shipping is really hard and you have to make it your main priority if you want to ship</li>
<li>Shipping doesn’t mean deploying code, it means making your leadership team happy</li>
<li>You need your leadership team to trust you in order to ship</li>
<li>Most of the essential technical work is in anticipating problems and creating fallback plans</li>
<li>You should asking yourself “can I ship right this second?”</li>
<li>Have courage!</li>

<p>If you’ve been reading this blog for any length of time, you’ll know that maps and history are two of my favorite things. I love history because I love learning about the vast panoply of the human experience, the millions of twisting threads of time that created the world we live in today. And I love maps because I don’t think you can really <em>understand </em>the world without being able to picture it. Maps are such amazing tools, laying out in detail how the world functions, its geography and politics and topography, and the ways in which those change over time. It probably won’t surprise you, then, to know that I like historical maps quite a lot. Learning about how someone chooses to depict the world can tell you quite a lot about their point of view, and seeing the way in which people in different times make different choices about how and what to illustrate can show you how our perception of the world has changed. That’s what we’re going to do today. I have here a small collection of historical maps that I think are <em>really cool</em>, and that I think can teach us something about our shared past. </p>



<p>In today’s edition, we’re going to look at the Second World War, with a particular focus on the maps that newspapers would print so their readership could follow along as the world burned. So, without further ado:</p>



<p>Previous Installments: <a href="https://nathangoldwag.wordpress.com/2017/05/08/visualizing-the-great-war/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WWI</a>, <a href="https://nathangoldwag.wordpress.com/2022/03/26/visualizing-the-past/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Part One</a>, <a href="https://nathangoldwag.wordpress.com/2023/05/19/visualizing-the-past-part-two/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Part Two</a>, <a href="https://nathangoldwag.wordpress.com/2024/06/09/visualizing-the-past-part-three/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Part Three</a> </p>



<p>In February 1942, as the United States reeled from the Pearl Harbor attack and girded itself for intercontinental warfare, President Franklin D. Roosevelt gave a speech to the American people about the coming conflict: </p>



<blockquote>
<p>This war is a new kind of war. It is different from all other wars of the past, not only in its methods and weapons but also in its geography. It is warfare in terms of every continent, every island, every sea, every air lane in the world.</p>



<p>That is the reason why I have asked you to take out and spread before you a map of the whole earth, and to follow with me the references which I shall make to the world-encircling battle lines of this war. Many questions will, I fear, remain unanswered tonight; but I know you will realize that I cannot cover everything in any one short report to the people.</p>
<cite><em>Fireside Chat, February 23, 1942</em>, Franklin D. Roosevelt (<a href="https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/fireside-chat-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Source</a>)</cite></blockquote>



<p>This was a global war, fought by a modern population with access to modern information sources. The new technologies that allowed millions of men to be mobilized allowed their families at home to follow along with a level of detail never before possible, and newspapers rushed to provide it. </p>



<figure><p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/ut1FHrR.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ut1FHrR.jpg"></a>
</p></figure>



<p>We’ll start with this map, published in the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> on September 10th, 1939, only ten days after Germany’s invasion of Poland. This is a wonderful example of what I love about this genre of work–the depth of detail and information that newspapers were attempting to convey to their readers. In 1939, the world was beginning to fall to pieces, and everybody knew it, and a lot of people wanted to <em>know more</em>. This map includes instructions for removing it from the paper and preserving it, under the assumption that you’d want to keep it to follow the course of the conflict. What I also love about this is that it’s from early enough in the war that the patterns and narratives that we take for granted haven’t coalesced yet. The USSR, Italy, and Balkan states are still neutral, and Charles H. Owens of <em>The Times</em> art staff takes note of potential rail and sea corridors with which the Western Allies could supply Poland–something that never materialized. Note also the focus on naval bases, fortifications, strategic resources, and the aerial distance between cities, as the artist tries to grapple with the new kind of warfare that was still being born. It’s a wonderful achievement.  </p>



<p>I cannot help but notice, however, that Mr. Owens has forgotten about the existence of Estonia. </p>



<figure><p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/pJosxOq.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/pJosxOq.jpg"></a>
</p></figure>



<p>Jumping back in time a few months, here we have a map of Germany at its greatest pre-war extent, following the <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anschluss" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Anschluss</a></em>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich_Agreement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Munich Agreement</a>, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protectorate_of_Bohemia_and_Moravia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Occupation of Czechoslovakia</a>. There are a few things of interest about this. Firstly, how contemporaneous it is–dated May 1939, it was only printed three months after the final events depicted had occurred. Second is how granular it is. We tend to blur many of the fine distinctions and territorial adjustments made by the NSDAP during this period, seeing everything as Allies, Axis, and/or Soviet, but issues like the independence of Slovakia and the cession of Carpatho-Ukraine to Hungary <a href="https://nathangoldwag.wordpress.com/2021/03/16/the-war-aims-of-the-lesser-axis-powers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">were of vital interest</a> to participants at the time. Third and last, we should take note of the source, the German Library of Information, in New York. <a href="https://commons.und.edu/theses/928/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">This was a</a> Nazi propaganda bureau established in 1936, specifically to try and influence American public opinion and popularize the German perspective on international affairs. (I appreciate the comparison of the German Reich’s scale to that of Texas, which I suspect was an attempt to emphasize how small it still was compared to the US). Today we’re so used to engaging with this time period from the perspective of either victors or apologists, that we forget that something like this map of territorial conquest–now seen only as an ominous indictment–could be presented as an achievement to be celebrated, even to a neutral audience. </p>



<figure><p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/O4tp7JB.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/O4tp7JB.jpg"></a>
</p></figure>



<p>Another propaganda map, this one published by the <em>Los Angeles Examiner</em> in 1937, showing the potential results of an American defeat in another world war, the specter of which was already rearing up over Europe. What’s fun about this one is that it is agnostic on <em>who </em>exactly would be defeating us; several years before the outbreak of the war, the coalition lines not yet firmly drawn, the <em>Examiner </em>focuses on speculating as to what resources and regions would be most coveted by the “victorious powers”, leaving it up to the reader’s imagination who those would be, exactly. It’s an intriguing look at the kind of perspective that I’m trying to showcase here, before hindsight solidified our understanding of the possible. Note, for example, that the main comparison point here is the post-WWI fate of Germany and Austria, as well as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partitions_of_Poland" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Partitions of Poland</a>. The <em>Los Angeles Examine</em>r opposed America’s entry into the First World War, and you can perhaps see echoes of that here.</p>



<figure><p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/0ipY0KH.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/0ipY0KH.jpg"></a>
</p></figure>



<p>The <em>San Francisco Examiner</em> published this map on June 2nd, 1940, just eight days before Italy entered the war on the side of the Axis, and it’s an absolutely <em>gorgeous </em>example of its genre. This map doesn’t just show you Italy and the Mediterranean, it attempts to give the reader the geopolitical and geographic context for the war, and what the various powers hoped to gain from it. Note how the headline correctly identifies the driving force behind Mussolini’s ambitions, completing the goals that Italy had failed to achieve in WWI. Three days after this was printed, Mussolini would tell Chief of the General Staff Pietro Badoglio “I only need a few thousand dead so that I can sit at the peace conference as a man who has fought”. I love this map because it really does tell you so much of what would happen over the next few years in this theater of war; from the conflicts in the Balkans as nations chose sides or were torn apart, the various imperialist and irredentist claims that <em>Il Duce</em> was pushing against his neighbors, to the vital supply lines between Sicily and Tripoli that Rommel <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Desert_campaign" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">would depend on</a>, and the thorn in its side at Malta, and Italy’s dependence on foreign trade routes with the Americas and the British Empire. The game board is set, the pieces are ready, and now we’re just waiting for someone to make the first move.  </p>

<p>Another example of the same genre, this one published by the <em>Chicago Daily Tribune</em>, a week after Pearl Harbor. The focus here is to show how the Japanese Empire has expanded over the previous fifty years, through the First Sino-Japanese War, Russo-Japanese War, World War I, and Second-Sino-Japanese War, leading up to the present crisis, with the Imperial Japanese Army and Navy threatening to overrun the East Indies and Philippines. The breakdown in expansion over time is so valuable, showing how these crises didn’t emerge from thin air, or from some primordial conflict, but were the result of long-running dynamics. With this, we can understand both the threat of Imperial Japan in 1941–and also how fragile it really was. </p>



<p>Note also the caption at the very bottom of the page: “This is another in the series of new colored war maps–offered as an aid to readers in visualizing the extent of the enemy empire across the Pacific.” </p>



<figure><p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/rdqQtFd.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/rdqQtFd.jpg"></a>
</p></figure>



<p>Here we see an effort by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_War_Relief" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Russian War Relief</a> Inc. to convey to the American people the scale and scope of the Eastern Front, and what the USSR was suffering in the war. You can find a similar juxtaposition map in my earlier WWI collection, and I think it says something about America’s uniquely privileged position over the last few centuries that these maps are the only way we can truly imagine our country occupied or invaded, and the rather desperate attempts by our allies to convince us of the true severity of their plight. Here the Soviets try and demonstrate to America what was happening there; the entire eastern seaboard occupied by a genocidal army, Rochester cut off and besieged for months, American soldiers fighting for every square inch of St. Louis as enemy tanks drive deep into the Southwest, tens of millions of refugees fleeing as the world ends around them. You can’t help but admit that it’s a very effective tool.  </p>

</p></figure>



<p>This is a really interesting item; a world map focusing not on borders or armies or resources but on air routes, the new field of battle truly coming into its own for the first time. Airplanes and airships were more than just useful tools or weapons, they were the subject of popular fascination and military imagination, as people tried to imagine the new world taking shape. H.G. Wells’ 1907 novel <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_War_in_the_Air" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The War in the Air</a></em>, in which fleets of aerial weapons destroy all of civilization, was emblematic of the fears of the time, which seemed to be vindicated by WWI. Following the war, innovative military theorists like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giulio_Douhet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Giulio Douhet</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Mitchell" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Billy Mitchell</a> envisioned a new type of warfare, in which air power would render everything else obsolete. This map, presented by the World Publishing Company of Cleveland, Ohio, makes an attempt to chart out the terrain and environment of this new stratospheric conflict that they could just see coming into view.  </p>



<figure><p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/yisvFfD.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/yisvFfD.jpg"></a>

<p>Earlier this year I was visiting family in Pennsylvania when I stumbled across a book entitled <em>Special Edition World War II: Six Years that Changed the World, 1939-1945</em>, containing reproductions of the front pages of the <em>Intelligencer</em> <em>Journal</em>, <em>Lancaster New Era</em>, and <em>Sunday News</em> from those years. I bought it at once. It’s an amazing resource, showing not just how contemporaries witnessed the war years, but specifically how they were covered by the newspapers of a relatively small <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancaster,_Pennsylvania" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">provincial city</a>. The paper’s article on Pearl Harbor, for example, <a href="https://nathangoldwag.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20241026_132614.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">features an inset</a> covering a sailor from Lancaster who was stationed at Hickam Field. This map, provided by the United Press, dates to May 10th, 1940, the same day that Germany launched <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_France" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fall Gelb</a></em>, the stunningly successful invasion of France, Belgium, and the Netherlands. It’s another example of this wonderful series of attempts to communicate the strategic situation to the public, published right at the moment when that situation irrevocably shifted. </p>



<figure><p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/xRmjVNu.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/xRmjVNu.jpg"></a>
</p></figure>



<p>Can Hitler invade England this year? Will he? To us, those are questions of alternate history–and not particularly interesting ones, for that matter. Most students of World War II will tell you that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Sea_Lion" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Operation Sea Lion</a> was never more than a pipe dream, and that the Nazis never had anything close to the resources needed to successfully carry it out. But to Americans in 1941 who’d watched France–widely regarded then as one of the most powerful countries on Earth–be humiliated and crushed by the Wehrmacht in only three months the previous year, it was a very real topic of concern. The <em>Intelligencer</em> <em>Journal</em> here attempts to game out the scenarios, examining how the new, ill-understood weapon systems of submarines and aircraft might allow Hitler to do what Napoleon never could. </p>



<p>There is something surreal about seeing charts of German airborne landings in England, not presented in a speculative fiction novel, but in the respectable local paper of a small American city, alongside headlines like “County Youth, 19, Has Meningitis” and “Poultry Meeting at Maytown High.” </p>



<figure><p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/kaMISFU.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/kaMISFU.jpg"></a>
</p></figure>



<p>Here we see another example from the same source, this time showing a diagram of the Allied landing of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Torch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Operation Torch</a> in November 1942. There’s a few reasons I wanted to spotlight this. First is the granularity of it, and the window it gives us into how people would have experienced these events. We see this as history, as clean lines on a map representing something immovably fixed in the past. But seventy years ago, Americans would have used maps like this to try and keep track of where their family members were, what they were doing, what they were facing. Operation Torch was the first large-scale US involvement in the European theater, and for those left behind at home, maps like this would have been their only way of knowing exactly what their loved ones were facing. </p>



<p>The other thing I love about this is that the creator seems to have added a completely fictional Free French advance up from Lake Chad through southern Tripolitania to outflank the Afrika Korps, something that would have been wildly impractical given that the Sahara Desert was in the way, and (as far as I know?) never even contemplated by Allied High Command. You can’t always trust what you read in the newspapers. </p>



<figure><p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/l4xyDRz.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/l4xyDRz.jpg"></a>
</p></figure>



<p><em>I love this so much.</em> We’ve talked a lot here about hindsight and perspective, and about how people living through events often have a very different way of looking at them than we do. But this “Ten Year Map” shows us that sometimes, people understand very well what they’re seeing. The <em>Intelligencer</em> <em>Journal</em> published this in November 1939, just a few months into the general European war, but what it does beautifully is place that war into the context of the geopolitical chaos that had engulfed the world over the preceding decade. “What The Decade Has Done To The Map” indeed. We see here not just German expansion in central Europe, and war with Poland, but the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Civil_War" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spanish Civil War</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Italo-Ethiopian_War" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Italian invasion of Ethiopia</a>, Japan’s conflicts with China and Russia, border disputes in South America and the Middle East, the growth of long-distance air travel, and how the New Deal and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee_Valley_Authority" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tennessee Valley Authority</a> reshaped the American landscape. The 1930s were an extraordinarily tumultuous decade, as the fragile post-WWI order began to implode, and I’ve never seen a better illustration of it. All put together like this, we can really see the fracture points and battle lines of the new world war coming into view. </p>



<p>And it’s all the more remarkable to realize that they were seeing this as it happened, in real time, unable to do anything but watch and read the morning paper. </p>

That world was very good to me. The times were good, as were the profits. It was a skill game, and a form of positive-sum entertainment, and I was happy to participate and help ensure the sophisticated customer got a high quality product. I knew it wasn’t the most socially valuable enterprise, but I certainly thought it was net positive. </p><p>When sports gambling was legalized in America, I was hopeful it too could prove a net positive force, far superior to the previous obnoxious wave of daily fantasy sports. </p><p>It brings me no pleasure to conclude that this was not the case. The results are in. Legalized mobile gambling on sports, let alone casino games, has proven to be a huge mistake.

This allows us to track all credit and debt outcomes for roughly 7 million Americans. </p><p>We leverage this data and compare states implementing sports gambling to those that don’t and study both sports gambling of any type as well as online/mobile gambling specifically. We study 8 financial/debt outcomes and find the following results:</p><p>First, credit scores, a summary metric of overall creditworthiness, decrease by modest but statistically significant amounts (~1%). We also test for evidence of pre-trends between treated/control states and find none.</p><p>…</p><p>Second, several measures of excessive debt increase substantially. We find a roughly 28% increase in bankruptcies and an 8% increase in debt transferred to debt collectors. Similarly, auto loan delinquencies increase substantially as does use of debt consolidation loans.</p><p>Interestingly, we find that banks restrict access to credit on average in affected states. Credit card limits decrease and the ratio of secured to unsecured loans increases. After three years post-legalization we actually find a decrease in credit card delinquencies as a result.</p></blockquote><p>I expected some negative impacts. But a 28% increase in bankruptcies is far more than I would have predicted. The typical adult bankruptcy rate is about 0.16%, so this would mean about 4bps (0.04%)/year of additional bankruptcies, or an over 1% additional chance a typical person goes bankrupt during their lifetime. </p><p>Alternatively as a sanity check, that’s on the order of 100,000 additional bankruptcies a year, which will rise over time if we don’t intervene. We are talking about an average handle of maybe 120 billion in 2023, but on average lower during this time period, let’s say average of 70 billion, with a likely sportsbook hold (before expenses) of something like 10% if we exclude advantage betters who are definitely not going bankrupt, given all the parlays and shaded lines and in-game betting and generally atrocious odds, so total net losses to ‘normal gamblers’ of 7 billion per year. </p><p>That suggests that for every $70k in net sportsbook gross profits from regular gamblers, someone filed for bankruptcy. That seems like a lot? It means those who are inclined to bet on sports are either often doing it out of desperation, or that the same causes that lead them to bet on sports and pushing them to the financial edge in other ways as well, and this is the straw breaking the camel’s back. Claude found it all plausible when I had it do a bunch of estimations. I do notice I am skeptical.</p><p>The result is clear. A bankruptcy is extremely socially expensive, on the order of $200k. That alone is almost triple the profits, and clearly wipes out all the social gains. </p><p>Legalized online sports betting is currently a deeply, deeply horrible deal. </p><p>I wish it were different. I am all for letting people do things, and I have enjoyed and benefited greatly from the ability to bet on sports. </p><p>And yes, I do think the majority of people who play plausibly get their money’s worth in entertainment, even at the outrageous prices charged. The problem is if a majority get a small benefit, and others get a huge loss, that is on net a disaster.</p><p>I can’t look at these findings, even if I don’t fully believe them, and not see a huge disaster from these effects alone.</p><p>I also can’t see a way in which the positive-sum benefits could justify that disaster.</p><p><span>We can then add a second paper, “</span><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4881086" rel="">Gambling Away Stability: Sports Betting’s Impact on Vulnerable Households</a><span>.” They found that sports betting greatly reduced traditional net investments, while traditional gambling stays unchanged. </span></p><blockquote><p><a href="https://www.maximum-progress.com/p/should-sports-betting-be-banned" rel="">Maxwell Tabarrok</a><span>: The negative effects on investment are large relative to the sample mean. The average household invests about $360 a quarter so a $50 decrease in investment is a loss of 14%.</span></p></blockquote><p>This includes households that never bet.</p><p>If this is fully real, that’s holy **** territory. It’s an apocalypse. We are decreasing net household investment by 14%? Can there possibly be compensation for that? Alex Tabarrok notes that various details seem like they prove too much, and I agree it seems unlikely the effects are this large. But it can be a lot smaller than that, and still way too high. </p><p>There are a variety of goods households can choose to consume, including traditional gambling. If sports gambling were a regular consumption good that consumers were choosing because they enjoy it more, it wouldn’t be having these effects. Eating dramatically into savings rather than shifting the consumption basket, while not even reducing traditional gambling, says that consumers are clearly not responding rationally, and do not understand the choices they are making. </p><p><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4938642" rel="">Here’s a third paper</a><span>, showing that sports betting increases domestic violence. When the home team suffers an upset loss while sports betting is legal, domestic violence that day goes up by 9% for the day, with lingering effects. </span></p><p>It is estimated 10 million Americans are victims of domestic violence each year.</p><p>Claude estimates if you extrapolate from this result that there might be a 3% overall increase in domestic violence as the result of legalized sports betting, which seems non-crazy given that betting on NFL home favorites is only a tiny portion of overall losses. </p><p><span>Again, this is an overall effect for the entire population. The percentage of people who bet on sports is rising rapidly, </span><a href="https://www.shu.edu/business/news/sports-poll-finds-slowed-growth-for-sports-betting.html#:~:text=Among%20the%20general%20population%2C%2037,2022%20it%20was%2041%20percent." rel="">but even so only 34% said they placed even one bet</a><span> in 2023, and many of those will be limited to nominal wagers on things like the Super Bowl and March Madness. </span><a href="https://www.wamc.org/news/2024-02-09/new-poll-finds-39-of-americans-bet-on-sporting-events-ahead-of-super-bowl-sunday" rel="">This survey has 39% sports betting participation</a><span>, with about 35% of betters betting at least once a week. So again, the effects on the households that actually gamble are far higher.</span></p><p>This is a huge direct cost to bear. Domestic violence ruins lives. It also is a huge indicator that this is causing large amounts of distress in various forms, and that those gambling on sports are not making rational or wise consumption decisions.</p><p>Meanwhile, frankly, the product emphasis and implementation sucks. Almost all of the legal implementations (e.g. everyone I know about except Circa) are highly predatory. That’s what can survive in this market.</p><p>Why? Predation is where the money is. There is no physical overhead at an online casino, but after paying for all the promotions and credit card payments and advertisements and licenses and infrastructure, the only way to make all that back under the current laws and business models is the above-mentioned 10%-style hold that comes from toxic offerings. </p><p>Thus high prices even on the main lines, even higher ones on parlays and in-game betting. Whenever I see lines on the TV I usually want to puke at how wide the prices are. In game odds are beyond obnoxious. Anyone this drives away is a customer they have decided not to want.</p><p>This is what the in-game odds look like when they’re relatively reasonable, and seriously, ow my balls:</p><div><figure><a

they are), advertisements, promotional texts and emails and especially a barrage of push notifications. </p><p>Anyone showing any skill? They are shown the door.  </p><p><span>I don’t think this is central to the case that current legal sports betting is awful, </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-27/sports-betting-apps-are-even-more-toxic-than-you-imagined?cmpid=BBD093024_MONEYSTUFF&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_term=240930&amp;utm_campaign=moneystuff" rel="">but it is illustrative what pros do in order to disguise themselves and get their wagers down</a><span>. That to do that, they make themselves look like the whales. Which means addicts.</span></p><p>I’m used to stories like this one, that’s normal:</p><blockquote><p><span>Ira Boudway (Bloomberg): If I open an account in New York, maybe for a few weeks I just bet the Yankees right before the game begins,” says Rufus Peabody, a pro bettor and co-host of the </span><em><a href="https://x.com/bettheprocess?lang=en" rel="">Bet the Process</a></em><span> podcast. If this trick works, the book sees these normie, hometown bets as a sign that it’s safe to raise his limits.</span></p></blockquote><p>It seems players have upped their game.</p><blockquote><p>One pro bettor I know set up a bot which logs in to his accounts every day between 2 and 4 a.m., to make it seem like he can’t get through the night without checking his bets. Another withdraws money and then reverses those withdrawals so it looks like he can’t resist gambling.</p><p><span>Simulating addictive behavior, says Peabody, is an effective way to get online sportsbooks to send you </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2022-03-30/sports-betting-app-promos-make-bettors-look-for-new-edge?sref=VBucTHzi" rel="">bonus money</a><span> and keep your accounts open. This isn’t necessarily because operators are targeting problem bettors, he says; they’re simply looking to identify and encourage customers who are likely to spend—and lose—the most. This just happens to be a good way to find and enable addicts, too.</span></p></blockquote><p>The rest of the post is filled with the usual statistics and tragic stories.</p><p>What I find interesting about these examples is that they are very level-1 plays.</p><p>As in, this is exactly what someone would do if they thought they were up against a system that was looking for signs of what type of player you are, but only in the most mechanical and simple sense. For this type of thing to work, the book must not be looking at details or thinking clearly or holistically.</p><p>If you had tried this stuff on me when I was watching customers, to the extent I noticed it at all, I am pretty sure I would if anything have caught you faster. </p><p>Vices and other distractions are constant temptations. When you carry a phone around with you, that temptation is ever present. </p><p>Indeed, I recently got a Pixel Watch, and the biggest benefit of it so far is that I can stay connected enough to not worry, and not be tempted to check for things, without the pull of what a phone can do. And we have repeatedly seen how distracting it is for kids in school to have the smartphone right there in their pocket. I have learned to be very, very careful with mobile games, even ones with no relevant microtransactions. </p><p>Putting gambling in your pocket makes the temptation to gamble ever-present. Even for those who can resist it, that is a not so cheap mental tax to pay, and likely to result in the occasional impulse bet, even without the constant notifications. First hit’s free. Constant offers that adjust to your responses, to get you to keep coming back. </p><p>Now consider that at least several percent of people have an acute gambling addiction or vulnerability. For them, this is like an alcoholic being forced to carry a flask around in their pocket 24/7, while talk of what alcohol to choose and how good it would be to use that flask right now gets constantly woven into all their entertainment, and they by default get notifications asking if now is a good time for a beer. You can have the apps back up and running within a minute, even if you delete them. </p><p>It was plausible that this was an acceptable situation, that people could mostly handle that kind of temptation. We have now run the experiment, and it is clear that too many of them cannot.</p><p>I am coming around to a generalized version of this principle. There is a vast difference between:</p><ol><li><p>Something being legal, ubiquitous, frictionless and advertised.</p></li><li><p>Something being available, mostly safe to get, but we make it annoying.</p></li><li><p>Something being actively illegal, where you can risk actual legal trouble.</p></li><li><p>Something being actively illegal and we really try to stop you (e.g. rape, murder). </p></li></ol><p>We’ve placed far too many productive and useful things in category 2 that should be in category 1. By contrast, we’ve taken too many destructive things, too many vices, that we long had the wisdom to put in category 2, and started putting them in category 1. </p><p>Prohibitions, putting such things into categories 3 and especially 4, tends to work out extremely poorly. Don’t do that unless absolutely necessary. Let people do privately destructive things if they want to do that. </p><p>Often, it is important that you make doing the wrong thing a little annoying. It is especially important to not make it annoying to do the productive things, and not annoying to instead do the destructive things. </p><p><a href="https://x.com/KelseyTuoc/status/1823112217979478260" rel="">The elite refrains from irresponsible gambling, but here sets up conditions where such irresponsible actions are the inevitable result. The actual big elite hypocrisy is not the failure to impose paternalistic rules on the non-elite, it is that we constantly</a><span> imposing extreme and expensive consumption requirements and restrictions on the non-elite when they are trying to live their lives and get their needs met. We impose these deeply restrictive, expensive and stupid elite norms on others all the time. </span></p><p>This paternalism severely damages their lives in numerous ways. This is the core reason why it is so difficult for ordinary people to pay their bills or raise families, despite earnings that would make them rich elsewhere or elsewhen. </p><p>These productive actions are severely restricted, because if you are going to be productive then you have to do so ‘correctly’ and obey all sorts of rules and requirements. Whereas if your actions are destructive, well then, go ahead, and it would be wrong of us to even enforce existing law.</p><p>That is a deeply toxic approach. We should reverse it. We should allow people to do productive actions as freely as possible, and put up frictions to sufficiently destructive actions. </p><p>Mobile gambling has shown itself to be a highly destructive action for its users, well in excess of any profits earned, sufficiently so as to substantially damage economic conditions. A that point, we need to draw the line.</p><p><a href="https://www.maximum-progress.com/p/should-sports-betting-be-banned" rel="">Maxwell Tabarrok makes the contrary case</a><span> that sports gambling is ordinary consumption, and we should not assume that so-called ‘vulnerable populations’ need protections from deciding to increase their consumption. He says the evidence is not compelling here. </span></p><p>His view is that this is no different from people buying Taylor Swift tickets. </p><p>In general I am highly sympathetic to this argument. I am not looking to tell people how much to invest or what goods to consume. But here I must strongly disagree.</p><p>I’ve certainly enjoyed consuming gambling, including in a few narrow small stakes cases where I wasn’t trying to be an advantage player. I think many others do so in ways that are not mistakes, or are mistakes we should allow them to make. </p><p>But ‘this is normal consumption’ seems to me like an absurd interpretation of the evidence above, and fails to understand the nature of the consumption being offered. You can’t place this ability to wager directly onto everyone’s phones at all times, putting the temptation at arm’s reach, see these consequences, and pretend these consequences are merely revealed preferences. </p><p>Most other prediction markets do not pose the same problems. They would not even if they greatly expanded and became more ‘normie’ friendly. </p><p>In particular, sports markets are highly related to and integrated into the most ‘normie’ of activities and into the related media, and they pay off quickly, and they’re ubiquitous, with something for you every day.</p><p>The legalized mobile online sports betting experiment is a clear failure. It should end. </p><p>You should need to go to a physical location to place fully legal bets of a non-trivial size, or at least interact with a human or bear some other cost or risk. </p><p>I’m fine with that location being the local sports bar, especially if the bar gets to book your action. Yes, I realize that will mean more illegal and untaxed online sports betting, but it is what it is. The barriers to doing that would do a lot of good work.  </p><p>At a bare minimum, the advertising and dark pattern complexes feeding this must be disempowered. The Federal Government should do what it can. The states should realize they are not doing themselves any favors and resist or undo this cash grab.</p><p>Legalized online casino gaming, allowing roulette or similar games from one’s phone, is of course far worse. That certainly should not be allowed via the internet. I am not keen to be expansive in what ‘counts as gambling’ but the obvious gambling that resolves in seconds and pays real money absolutely must go. We will need to figure out where to draw the line on ‘loot boxes’ and other game features, but if the more obnoxious and toxic versions of that got banned as well, that would be good too. </p><p><a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/online-sports-betting-hurts-consumers" rel="">Ben Krauss and Milan Singh reach the same conclusion at Slow Boring</a><span>, although they are less willing to fully bite the bullet. </span><a href="https://x.com/KelseyTuoc/status/1822333974548537644" rel="">Kelsey Piper, who similar to me is loathe to tell people what they cannot do, does bite the bullet</a><span>. </span><a href="https://x.com/esaagar/status/1838200488698732944" rel="">Here Saagar Enjeti bites the bullet</a><span>. </span><a href="https://archive.fo/FeAy9#selection-687.0-687.45" rel="">Here Charles Fain Lehman at The Atlantic bites the bullet</a><span>. </span></p><p>Otherwise, as the amount of gambling expands, it is only going to get worse.</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

He has a great way of explaining things. </span><a href="https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/33470/what-technical-reasons-are-there-to-have-low-maximum-password-lengths/33471#33471" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">My favorite answer he ever gave</a><span> responds to a query as to why so many applications still had character length restrictions (this was some years ago), typically eight characters, on passwords:</span></p><pre><code><code>Take five chimpanzees. Put them in a big cage. Suspend some bananas from the roof of the cage. Provide the chimpanzees with a stepladder. BUT also add a proximity detector to the bananas, so that when a chimp goes near the banana, water hoses are triggered and the whole cage is thoroughly soaked.

Soon, the chimps learn that the bananas and the stepladder are best ignored.

Now, remove one chimp, and replace it with a fresh one. That chimp knows nothing of the hoses. He sees the banana, notices the stepladder, and because he is a smart primate, he envisions himself stepping on the stepladder to reach the bananas. He then deftly grabs the stepladder... and the four other chimps spring on him and beat him squarely. He soon learns to ignore the stepladder.

Then, remove another chimp and replace it with a fresh one. The scenario occurs again; when he grabs the stepladder, he gets mauled by the _four_ other chimps -- yes, including the previous "fresh" chimp. He has integrated the notion of "thou shallt not touch the stepladder".

Iterate. After some operations, you have five chimps who are ready to punch any chimp who would dare touch the stepladder -- and none of them knows why.

Originally, some developer, somewhere, was working on an old Unix system from the previous century, which used the old [DES-based "crypt"](https://ftp.gnu.org/old-gnu/Manuals/glibc-2.2.3/html_chapter/libc_32.html), actually a password _hashing_ function derived from the DES block cipher. In that hashing function, only the first eight characters of the password are used (and only the low 7 bits of each character, as well). Subsequent characters are ignored. That's the banana.

The Internet is full of chimpanzees.

I'd like to go over the implications of this; the next several (and probably many more a year until I retire or die) will be to understand the </span><em>why</em><span> for common, useless security controls.</span></p><p>If the control can only be explained in a nebulous way, such as "to improve security" or "for compliance reasons", that's probably a useless control. If the security-ish person forcing the control on you cannot adequately explain it, it's probably because they have no idea why themselves. If that security-ish person doesn't understand why, it's a good heuristic that there isn't a legitimate why at all.</p><p>"But Jon," you say, unhappily trapped in this conversation, "What if the reasoning is very complex and hard to explain to people who are not experienced security masters?". This is a fair question on the surface.</p><p>How many controls can you think of that you know are useful, and you genuinely know why they are, but you can't explain it in 2-3 sentences to someone with a modicum of technical understanding? Some examples:</p><ul><li><p>Encryption in transit is valuable because it prevents anyone with access to points on the network between you and your friend from viewing or modifying your messages</p></li><li><p>Private S3 buckets are valuable so you don't leak your data all over the place and have embarrassing articles written about you</p></li><li><p>Cross-site scripting (XSS) safe front-end frameworks like React are good because they prevent XSS. XSS is bad because it allows an attacker to take over your active web session and do horrible things</p></li></ul><p><span>See? Easy. There are many complex things about security, but these are almost all in </span><em>how</em><span> we do things. The why is almost always pretty simple.</span></p><p><span>You won't be able to give wonderful off-the-cuff explanations for </span><em>every </em><span>security control you ever implement. It's more that every control you consider, spend resources implementing, and spend other teams' resources in dealing with the implantation should be explainable after you think about it. The reason should never just be "to support our robust security posture." That's a tautology, and tautologies </span><a href="https://xkcd.com/703/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">outside of XKCD comics</a><span> are bad.</span></p><p>When I rant about this with my peers, mentors, friends, family, and unfortunate bystanders at the bar, a common reframe is, "Why is this so bad"? It's still people caring about security. So what if some of that isn't as effective as it could be?</p><p>We are so resource-constrained as an industry. There's not enough manpower, budget, and political capital. We can't be wasteful while still being effective stewards of the systems and data entrusted to us. We can't waste any of it! And we certainly can't keep asking for more budget when we're blowing 50% of what we already have on useless crap.</p><p>People, going about their everyday lives and jobs with their own problems, deadlines, and OKRs, have a finite amount of fucks to give about security. You have to use those fucks very sparingly. We can only get the average person to do a few things to help secure themselves or their company; wasting most of those slots on uselessness is devastating. We can't afford to be chimps.</p><p>These also aren't decisions that only affect the implementing company. Many useless controls are in compliance and control frameworks and standard maturity models, forcing waste on whole swaths of companies.</p><p>Many, many more are added by well-meaning security teams to security questionnaires, forcing every company that tries to sell to them to at least spend time discussing why they don't do it. Sometimes this leads to much back and forth, wasting time on both sides. I've spent depressing amounts of time implementing useless controls, not for their value (there was none), but because the time cost was lower than explaining to prospects why we don't do them every single week. This is devastating to security teams at medium-sized companies; I know several 3-4-person security teams whose roadmaps are hamstrung due to the cost of customer requests for useless dribble. </p><p>Worse, useless controls may be added to contractual security addendums. Worst, these contractual requirements can be recursive: As a signing company, I not only have to implement the useless control myself but require all of my significant sub-processors to implement it as well. These types of contractual requirements can be depressingly hard to unwind, leaving the entire industry in a less secure state, not because we even think the control is useful anymore, but because we're contractually bound to beat up any chimp who tries to effect change and grab a banana.</p><p>Don't be a chimp.</p><p>Don't implement controls without knowing why! You should be able to figure out the threat model related to the control, understand the threat this control is mitigating or the outcome you're looking for, and vaguely, how. You don't need to understand the TLS handshake process, how keys are computed, or how cipher suites are negotiated, but you need to understand what TLS buys you and where that is actually useful.</p><p>If you're on a security team, you should demand this from your peers. </p><p><span>If you're a normal employee, engineer, or executive reading this post for some reason, you should demand this from your security team. Make them tell you why. If they can't in a satisfactory way, it's </span><em>probably</em><span> not because it's complicated but because they don't really know themselves. Send them this post as a response; I can use the impressions.</span></p><p>I'll be publishing a series of posts diving into useless controls that we still demand everywhere. Many of these are ones we call for all the time in industry everywhere, so I hope it'll be interesting!</p><p>Some of these are controls many of my friendly enterprise clients care deeply about still, and to avoid giving them an aneurysm, I'll confirm I actually carry those out where appropriate. I do carry them out, very well, because I like their money. </p><p>Do you agree? Disagree? Intensely? Do you have any other feedback for me?

Mostek had grown into the one’s top producer of DRAM, and every Z80 microprocessor — including Zilog-branded ones — went through tests there.</p><p>Mostek also tested Fairchild F-8 CPU chips and exotic parts such as the Magnavox “Star” T.V. tuner chips. The system was general purpose enough, we could test RAMs, ROMs and calculators — though we made our own custom testers for these. The room did most of the heavy lifting on all of the early CPU chips. Mostek also had a second-source license for many popular CPU chips — the Farichild F-8 series, the Z80, the Intel 8088/6, and the Motorola 68000 family.</p><p>Several MTSI engineers began their careers at Mostek which invented the multiplexed DRAM, too. But back in 1971, Mostek’s engineers were introduced to the Sentry 610. Fairchild Systems had just introduced the first computer-controlled, modularized, expandable test system product line in the the Sentry series. These third-generation systems were designed to test complex MSI/ LSI integrated circuits, electronic subsystems, and systems.</p><p>The machine was a beauty.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F71b57236-a299-4001-90de-a3e58de058f5_720x343.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel="nofollow ugc noopener"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F71b57236-a299-4001-90de-a3e58de058f5_720x343.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F71b57236-a299-4001-90de-a3e58de058f5_720x343.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F71b57236-a299-4001-90de-a3e58de058f5_720x343.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F71b57236-a299-4001-90de-a3e58de058f5_720x343.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F71b57236-a299-4001-90de-a3e58de058f5_720x343.png" width="720" height="343" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/71b57236-a299-4001-90de-a3e58de058f5_720x343.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:343,&quot;width&quot;:720,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:127440,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F71b57236-a299-4001-90de-a3e58de058f5_720x343.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F71b57236-a299-4001-90de-a3e58de058f5_720x343.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F71b57236-a299-4001-90de-a3e58de058f5_720x343.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F71b57236-a299-4001-90de-a3e58de058f5_720x343.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>From clockwise from the upper left, the system comprised a disk drive, a 9-track tape, the Fairchild 24-bit CPU, a terminal and printer, the Sentry 610 Tester, and a pair of 64-pin test heads. The door to this temperature and humidity-controlled room is on the right, in the back of this photograph, down the ramp to the right.</p><p>The disk drive was a head-per-track unit, with a large platter rotating on its side. It was 26 inches in diameter and stored 75,000 bits. This particular disk developed flakies in 1974, so I was elected to drape it with plastic, crawl under it, and spend a shift carefully wiping the surface with alcohol. To my surprise, it worked. The surface looked like raw steel instead of the oxide that I expected.</p><p>The CPU was a Sentry 400-series CPU running “Factor,” Fairchild’s test language. The machine was 24-bits wide at about 250 Khz. There were two boxes of cards, about 12″ X 18″, and 12 boards with 2-bit slices per board. You could access it by pulling the black latch on the left side, and swinging open the door. On the front of the CPU was a LED bank behind plexiglass to make Blinkenlights. I still have the test handbook for it.</p><p>This CPU had a “short” and “long” bus mapped to the various peripherals. One night it failed to boot, which would cost a few thousand dollars an hour. I assigned a technician in training to fix it. An hour or so later he found it, but did not know what to do next. He toggled the switches to go to the short data bus, and after many flicks of the switch and looking through a file cabinet of documentation, he proved to me he was able to write the necessary data to access the disk via the long data bus and read back the disk register.&nbsp;</p><p>Sure enough, there was a bit set, which the documents said was the “disk online” bit, and it was off.</p><p>“Oh,” I said. I turned around, and the “Online” switch was flipped downward on the disk. “Click.” It was a great learning lesson in depth of how the CPU worked, for him and me both.</p><blockquote><p><strong>“Optimized for engineering, sophisticated production needs, QA and test center operations, the Sentry 610 is the most versatile analytical tester available for engineering and production. It can perform the widest range of tests for the broadest range of components. At user option, the Sentry 610 can perform high-speed MaS/LSI, PCB, and bipolar tests simultaneously. It offers complete testing at the wafer level and through automatic handlers at full-rated device speeds up to 10 MHz. The wide choice of peripherals gives the Sentry 610 system massive data handling capacity to manipulate, analyze, compute and generate reports on test procedures in analyzing MaS/LSI."</strong></p><p><em>A Profile of Fairchild Systems Technologies, 1975</em></p></blockquote><p>A full-rated device speed of 10 Mhz was quite fast for this era. The Sentry 610 was based on an 11 Mhz clock and a wild ECL divide-by-11 circuit made of NOR gates and flip-flops which I had to troubleshoot to fix a Magnavox TV tuner test.</p><p>The tester had removable panels and two doors that could swing open. Each door held three banks of cards of TTL and ECL logic, with a five-foot-tall, wire-wrapped backplane. I once tried to count the ICs in the tester and came up with a number — around 60,000 chips. The center panel was filled with large — and very heavy — rack mount power supplies. At the bottom, in the black area, were three-phase twist-n-lock 220V power connectors, a bank of 110V AC utility outlets, and cables running to the two test heads. The black panel running horizontally had some test BNCs no one ever used, and a key to power it off and on.</p><p>We had to be careful about those AC utility jacks. The tester ground was at -11 volts at several hundred amps. If you clipped a scope to a ground, it would happily melt the insulation off the scope probe until it stunk up the room and pooled on the floor. We had to use a three-prong adapter with the ground cut off.</p><p>The tester could DMA test patterns from the disk to the pins of the DUT at full speed, change power supply voltages at megahertz rates, and via microcode running out of ECL RAM, call test subroutines in hardware at the full clock rate. Each test vector looked like a binary 101011..001, 64 bits long, and each bit set an output high or low, or was an expected response.</p><p>These bits basically were wired to the test pins. Someone wrote a Z80 cross compiler that made “Set F 10101010101……100101” statements from assembly language, so we could test actual code on the Z80 at full speed. It was exotic tech for us. We could only compare it to the assembly language PDP-11 testers we typically made. Mostek made all their own custom testers except for these.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6d63c102-1751-41b0-8a8d-0eb63dc7e262_300x300.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel="nofollow ugc noopener"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6d63c102-1751-41b0-8a8d-0eb63dc7e262_300x300.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6d63c102-1751-41b0-8a8d-0eb63dc7e262_300x300.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6d63c102-1751-41b0-8a8d-0eb63dc7e262_300x300.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6d63c102-1751-41b0-8a8d-0eb63dc7e262_300x300.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6d63c102-1751-41b0-8a8d-0eb63dc7e262_300x300.png" width="300" height="300" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/6d63c102-1751-41b0-8a8d-0eb63dc7e262_300x300.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:300,&quot;width&quot;:300,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:87173,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6d63c102-1751-41b0-8a8d-0eb63dc7e262_300x300.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6d63c102-1751-41b0-8a8d-0eb63dc7e262_300x300.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6d63c102-1751-41b0-8a8d-0eb63dc7e262_300x300.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6d63c102-1751-41b0-8a8d-0eb63dc7e262_300x300.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>The test heads had a circular array of pin electronics (PE) cards.

<div><p>Earlier this year, Daniel, a filmmaker from England, wanted to watch Béla Tarr’s take on <em>Macbeth</em>, a TV movie by the <a href="https://i-d.co/article/krisztian-eder-april-breeze-photo-zine/" data-type="link" data-id="https://i-d.co/article/krisztian-eder-april-breeze-photo-zine/">Hungarian</a> auteur that had aired in 1982 on the Magyar Televízió network. On <a href="https://i-d.co/article/arthouse-cannibal-movies/" data-type="link" data-id="https://i-d.co/article/arthouse-cannibal-movies/">arthouse</a> subreddits like /<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ObscureMedia/comments/ao6f3x/macbeth_1982_a_hungarian_tv_movie_adaptation_by/">ObscureMedia</a> and /<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/criterion/comments/ku779v/does_anyone_here_know_where_i_can_watch_b%C3%A9la/">Criterion</a>, the film had become the subject of intrigue. It’s composed of just two takes, the first five minutes long, the second 57 minutes. The famous three witches are all played by men.&nbsp;</p><p>But in an era of supposedly infinite choices, Béla Tarr’s <em>Macbeth </em>is impossible to find.&nbsp;</p><p>No streaming service hosts the film, even the specialist ones, and a DVD that included it as a bonus feature is long out of print. But, like many a determined cinephile, Daniel did some digging, found an illegal stream on a “a random archive website” and let himself be flooded by Tarr’s existential universe.</p><p>For anyone interested in movies and their history, breaking the law is a common situation. If it’s not on iTunes, or Amazon, or any of the big streamers, niche streamers, or the scrappy upstarts like the ad-supported B-movie haven Tubi, what else is there to do? For every <em>Atlantics</em> (2019) or <em>All Quiet on the Western Front</em> (2022) – festival hits that got splashy streaming deals with Netflix – there are films from visionary, award-winning directors, like Hong Sang-soo, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivian_Qu">Vivian Qu</a> and <a href="https://i-d.co/article/xavier-dolan-controversy-interview-new-film/">Xavier Dolan</a>, which never got official US or UK releases.&nbsp;</p><p>In other parts of the world, access is even more restricted. “The kinds of movies that get mainstream distribution in India are super limited,” says the Chennai-based filmmaker Ashwin Arvind. His discovery of arthouse cinema coincided with the realisation that Spanish director <a href="https://i-d.co/article/pedro-almodovar-strange-way-of-life-interview-pedro-pascal/">Pedro Almodóvar</a>’s films had no Indian distribution, so he streamed them illegally instead. “With India’s censor board there’s no way that we were getting any films with any graphic content uncut.”&nbsp;</p></div>

<div><p>Pre-2010 arthouse is even more scarce. The transition from physical media to streaming in the late 00s led to the quiet loss of a slew of films that had previously been available from specialist companies like Tartan, Artificial Eye <em>et al.</em> Apichatpong Weerasethakul’s <em>Blissfully Yours</em> won the <a href="https://i-d.co/article/photos-cannes-film-festival-francesc-planes-gonzo-glamour-debauchery/">Cannes Film Festival</a>’s Un Certain Regard prize back in 2002 and is not legally viewable anywhere. Federico Fellini’s rare circus documentary <em>I Clowns</em> (1970) was re-released a decade ago, only for its distribution deal to expire<em>. The Falls</em> (1980), the abstract three-hour debut movie of Peter Greenaway, known best for <em>The Cook, the Thief, His Wife &amp; Her Lover</em> (1989), has fallen into the abyss.&nbsp;</p><p>A slew of sites – most of them legally dubious – are making these forgotten films available to everyone. Rarefilmm is a curated online archive of hundreds of niche, hard-to-find movies, often lifted from their original film print, from 1910s silent films about New York starlets to Nicaraguan <a href="https://i-d.co/article/coming-of-age-documentaries/">coming-of-age</a> dramas from the 1980s. A regularly updated <a href="https://letterboxd.com/rhettman417/list/movies-on-rarefilmmcom/">list</a> on Letterboxd includes every film they feature, and an <a href="https://rarefilmm.com/chat-room/">online chatroom</a> sees visitors share recommendations based on what they’ve watched. Similarly, a collection of sites specialise in doing the same thing, organising films by their area of origin: be it <a href="https://sovietmoviesonline.com/">Soviet</a>, <a href="https://easterneuropeanmovies.com/">Eastern European</a> or <a href="https://asian-movies-online.com/">Asian</a>. Beyond these platforms, users on reddit regularly point people towards other sites, like archive.org, through which a quick search can uncover a hard to find film uploaded illegally online, if poorly signposted, years ago. Since May, the Rarefilmm following on X has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240518064721/https://x.com/rarefilmm">nearly doubled</a>.&nbsp;</p></div>



<figure><blockquote><p>“I send my film to people all the time”</p><cite>crystal moselle</cite></blockquote></figure>



<div><p>Of course, cinephiles have been torrenting and sharing hard-to-find movies for two decades and change, but it’s occured mostly via private communities like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karagarga">Karagarga</a>, where users share links to barely-seen films and add subtitles to unsubtitled foreign language features. But a new boom in interest in those films, perhaps fuelled by Letterboxd’s rise to prominence, has created a greater appetite for the stuff that’s trickier to find.</p><p>Some filmmakers are all for it. “I send my film to people all the time,” says the director <a href="https://i-d.co/article/skate-kitchen-crystal-moselle/" data-type="link" data-id="https://i-d.co/article/skate-kitchen-crystal-moselle/">Crystal Moselle</a> (<em>The Black Sea</em>, HBO’s <em>Betty</em>). She won’t say which one. “There’s people that don’t have it in their countries, and spreading the word of the work to me is more important [than adhering to distribution rules].” Moselle says that pirated material was key to honing her craft. When she was in her early 20s, she would buy bootleg VHS copies of <em>Grey Gardens </em>and<em> </em>movies by Wong Kar-wai from vendors on the <a href="https://i-d.co/article/nuevayorkinos-instagram-photography/">New York City</a> sidewalk. The former, she says, was “the kind of film that really inspired me to make documentaries [that were] fly on the wall and voyeuristic.”&nbsp;</p><p>Filmmakers are moulded versions of their influences, so if the budding ones are only able to access whatever surfaces on VOD, then the possibility of making art that pushes against that standard becomes near-impossible. Examples like<em> All Quiet…</em> and <em>Atlantics</em> are the anomaly; for the most part, Netflix isn‘t prioritising arthouse and foreign language film. Streaming services operate in the world of media for mass consumption, subject to the same strict distribution rules as every other competitor. As a result, films fall out of their hands, or they can choose to remove a project – or sell off the rights of their projects to other services – should they choose. Their guiding principle is distribution, not preservation.&nbsp;</p><p>Master of scuzzy and distasteful American comedy <a href="https://i-d.co/article/john-waters-on-karma-the-art-of-selling-out-and-dropping-acid-at-70/">John Waters</a> has an allergy towards these new media behemoths. If filmmakers are more concerned with their film existing forever over the money it will make them in the short term, “don’t sell to Netflix,” is his advice. “It’s called show business, not show art.”</p><p>But even with his underground heritage, Waters equally represents the mixed feelings many filmmakers have towards the illegitimate way their work is seen. On one hand, he wants audiences to have access to the films that he makes. Simultaneously, he wants to ensure that he retains control over what those titles are.</p></div>

<div><p>Waters‘ early work, so salacious it has routinely been destroyed by the censorship boards asked to grade it, has become arthouse catnip:&nbsp;films that young cinephiles once had to scourge for on shared VHS tapes are now find on digital clouds and drives. Films like <em>Eat Your Makeup </em>(1968), his 16mm comedy about a kidnapping nanny, and his Divine-starring short <em>The Diane Linkletter Story </em>(1970), have never been officially released, but have found cult audiences online via pirated streams. The source? “Don’t ask me!” he says.</p><p>Waters keeps an eye on what leaks online from his unreleased catalogue and files a Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) request for it to be removed when he spots something. “If you don’t watch over it and you allow it, you lose your copyright,” he says. While he accepts that the ones that have been officially released have been pirated and shared already, he really doesn’t want you to watch the unreleased ones illegally. “I don’t sign them at book signings. Some of those films I don’t want in distribution. They’re too old.” Even so, he appreciates the curated platforms that specialise in vintage films. “When I was starting, the only place you could ever see rare films was college film series,” he says. “Now you can look at every scene and every cut.”</p><p>Even so, no archive is perfect, and that’s where the global community of <em>extremely</em>&nbsp;online cinephiles come in. This June, Rarefilmm’s Whitehead posted a download of <em>Four Letter Word</em>, <a href="https://i-d.co/article/sean-baker-on-the-magical-honesty-of-the-florida-project-and-sliding-into-his-actors-dms/">Sean Baker</a>’s offbeat early comedy from 2000. After posting it, Baker himself reached out, asking Whitehead to delete it as well as&nbsp; <a href="https://i-d.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/bakerrarefilmm.jpg">sharing the news</a> that the film’s 4K restoration would be coming soon. And, later this month, Béla Tarr’s <em>Macbeth</em> will finally <a href="https://film.curzon.com/film/bela-tarr-a-curzon-collection/#synopsis">receive an official release</a> in the UK, via Curzon.&nbsp;</p><p>In the 15 years since Tarr’s <em>Macbeth</em> was last available to purchase, the illegal downloads and streams have helped quell the desires of those who were desperate to watch it, its legacy kept alive by some intrepid internet-literate cinephiles. The work that survives, it turns out, is the work that is out there to be seen.</p></div>

<hr>
<p>So in a nutshell I made this:</p>
<figure><div><p><img alt="An image" src="https://questdb.io/img/blog/2024-10-24/gb-vid.gif" loading="lazy"></p><figcaption>A trading Gameboy</figcaption></div></figure>
<h2 id="the-story">The story<a aria-label="Direct link to The story" title="Direct link to The story" href="https://questdb.io/blog/making-a-trading-gameboy/#the-story">​</a></h2>
<p>I didn't wake up one day thinking I'd make a trading Gameboy.</p>
<p>It all came about gradually. Some might say I fell into a rabbit hole.</p>
<p>While it's satisfying to create something, I took the most pleasure in learning
new things and gradually solving new problems.</p>
<p>This post is to share much of that I have learned.</p>
<h2 id="from-displaying-a-price">From displaying a price...<a aria-label="Direct link to From displaying a price..." title="Direct link to From displaying a price..." href="https://questdb.io/blog/making-a-trading-gameboy/#from-displaying-a-price">​</a></h2>
<p>My kid had a <a href="https://questdb.io/blog/raspberry-pi-5-benchmark/" rel="">Raspberry Pi</a> and he loved it.</p>
<p>Debian came pre-installed with a version of minecraft, and he really enjoyed
having a tiny single-board computer with dangling wires. Unfortunately, the
bare-bones setup was also a weakness and we ended up stepping on the HDMI
connector and rendering the board unusable.</p>
<p>One day, he asked if I could get him a replacement. Upon checking the
<a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Raspberry Pi website</a>, I came across the
Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller and a basic electronic kit with buttons, LEDs,
and a two-line display which seemed more appropriate for his age.</p>
<p>Unlike the Raspberry Pi computer, the Pico is a microcontroller. Mostly this
means it's not running an operating system and instead can run simple code. They
are also typically less powerful with only 256kb of RAM instead of Gigabytes for
the bigger brother, and have a lower clock speed.</p>
<p>However, this also means the controller starts immediately running your code
upon power up, and it does not have to share resources to maintain an underlying
system. This results in low power consumption, making them appropriate for
battery-powered use cases.</p>
<p>After blinking a few coloured LEDs, we found that we could use potentiometers to
control how much electricity would go through the circuit. We could then read
this value from a screen. With some tinkering, we made a calculator which would
multiply two numbers which are set using the potentiometer:</p>
<figure><div><p><img alt="An image" src="https://questdb.io/img/blog/2024-10-24/calculator.webp" loading="lazy"></p><figcaption></figcaption></div></figure>
<p>This was a pretty cool object to bring to school for a demo, and both of us were
pretty satisfied. But it then occurred to me that we could do so much more with
these, particularly as I found that some versions of the Pico microcontroller
contained a wireless chip.</p>
<p>So, as someone deeply interested in finance, I knew that <em>technically</em> nothing
could stop me from connecting to, say, an API and then display stock prices on
the screen. And that's what I ended up doing with the Raspberry Pi Pico, and a
matrix of LEDs:</p>
<figure><div><p><img alt="An image" src="https://questdb.io/img/blog/2024-10-24/led-matrix.webp" loading="lazy"></p><figcaption></figcaption></div></figure>
<p>There were a few variations of this idea with train times and so on, but the
main concept was there. It then occurred to me that simply looking at a price
may not be as interesting, so I started experimenting with charts instead.</p>
<p>This meant using a different display, able to render more details. I found one
called the
<a href="https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/pico-display-pack-2-0?variant=39374122582099" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Pimoroni Pico Display Pack 2.0</a>,
which came with a lot of benefits for my use case.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, it included a socket, which means one can simply fit the
microcontroller to the back of the display and not worry with wires.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Second, it came with 4 built-in buttons which also simplifies wiring.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lastly, it has a
<a href="https://github.com/pimoroni/pimoroni-pico/blob/main/micropython/modules/picographics/README.md" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">pretty robust library</a>
which allows you to display primitives on a screen such as text, lines,
squares, circles, polygons, etc.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<figure><div><p><img alt="An image" src="https://questdb.io/img/blog/2024-10-24/display-pack.webp" loading="lazy"></p><figcaption></figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Above I used the buttons to allow the player to take a long or short position in
the underlying. However, I quickly found the game uninteresting because it was
purely based on luck: Watch a line on the screen and go long/short/flat.</p>
<p>I knew I wanted to gamify this, but had to find a different model to make it
enjoyable.</p>
<h2 id="to-making-markets">...To making markets<a aria-label="Direct link to ...To making markets" title="Direct link to ...To making markets" href="https://questdb.io/blog/making-a-trading-gameboy/#to-making-markets">​</a></h2>
<p>It then occurred to me that a market-making game would be more interesting.</p>
<p>When market-making, you are quoting on both exchanges and over the counter,
hedging in the underlying market and taking/managing risk. A large difference
between market making and the previous game is that in market making, you are
constantly quoting both sides, and other participants come and trade against
you.</p>
<p>But you don't decide whether to buy or sell, your counterparties do. However,
you can then decide what to do with this position, for example hedge it
immediately, warehouse it, etc.</p>
<p>One particularly satisfying dynamic was to offset the flow: Get a position
through someone hitting your quotes and shortly after receive an opposite trade
which closes this position. While you could have closed the position yourself,
waiting for passive flow instead means you don't cross the bid-ask spread and
maximise your margin.</p>
<p>It quickly dawned on me that four buttons would not be sufficient. This led me
to the rabbit hole of 3D printing. I won't go into too much detail here, but I
bought a
<a href="https://www.prusa3d.com/fr/produit/kit-de-l-original-prusa-mini-2/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Prusa Mini +</a>,
some calipers, and after some measurements, a lot of trial and error, and a
lousy soldering job, I ended up with this.</p>
<figure><div><p><img alt="An image" src="https://questdb.io/img/blog/2024-10-24/gameboy-first.webp" loading="lazy"></p><figcaption></figcaption></div></figure>
<h2 id="game-on">Game on!<a aria-label="Direct link to Game on!" title="Direct link to Game on!" href="https://questdb.io/blog/making-a-trading-gameboy/#game-on">​</a></h2>
<p>In this game, there is a red line representing the fair value, and your bid and
offer prices in green and blue. You can control your quotes by increasing or
decreasing the spread, and skewing your quotes up and down to attract more flow
on the side you're axed on (where you have a preference or bias towards buying
or selling).</p>
<p>Say you just bought a lot of XYZ. You probably want to sell and don't want to
buy more of it. You would then skew your quotes down by a few basis points which
makes it more likely for you to sell (you are giving a more aggressive sell
price), and conversely less likely to buy.</p>
<p>However, at this stage I started running into some issues. The first was that
building this was very tedious. I had to solder a lot of cables within this box.
In addition, I was unsatisfied with the software side and the game felt slow and
clunky.</p>
<p>So with the same concept, I went for a complete overhaul.</p>
<h3 id="the-idea-of-the-game">The idea of the game<a aria-label="Direct link to The idea of the game" title="Direct link to The idea of the game" href="https://questdb.io/blog/making-a-trading-gameboy/#the-idea-of-the-game">​</a></h3>
<p>In this game, you act as a market-maker on the ETF markets. Your job is to quote
a tradeable bid price and ask price on the exchange at all times, while
answering OTC requests for larger trades and managing your risk. You control
your prices through algo parameters and fight for being first in the orderbook
on the side you prefer to trade on. You can also place orders manually.</p>
<p>To manage your risk, you can trade in the underlying markets. For example, if
you sell S&amp;P 500 ETFs, you are short. To mitigate this risk, you can buy a hedge
instrument (for example S&amp;P500 futures) which are perfectly correlated to the
ETF and therefore render yourself immune to market movements.</p>
<p>As you trade the ETFs on exchange and OTC, you accumulate risk which you can
choose to neutralise in the hedge markets. Doing so has a cost and reduces the
margin you make on each trade. So does trading the ETF directly with the market
as you'd pay the spread. You can execute hedges via algos such as TWAP which
make your hedge adjust slower, but also at a lower cost since you spread
execution over time.</p>
<p>If you're doing a good job, you capture a lot of flow, win a lot of trade
requests, and don't lose money nor take disproportionate risk. Events such as a
release new financial figures or major news happen from time to time, so you
want to make sure you're not outright long or short when this happens.
Additionally, you don't have the best latency, so you want to avoid keeping your
quotes during figures as you'd be subject to latency arbitrage.</p>
<p>Overall this is a good representation of the dynamics of market-making in the
ETF space, and a good entry point for beginners or junior traders to understand
the basic principles behind it.</p>
<h2 id="improving-the-hardware">Improving the hardware<a aria-label="Direct link to Improving the hardware" title="Direct link to Improving the hardware" href="https://questdb.io/blog/making-a-trading-gameboy/#improving-the-hardware">​</a></h2>
<p>Let's dig more into the constructive details.</p>
<h3 id="pcb">PCB<a aria-label="Direct link to PCB" title="Direct link to PCB" href="https://questdb.io/blog/making-a-trading-gameboy/#pcb">​</a></h3>
<p>To avoid cutting and soldering wires, the solution was a printed circuit board
(PCB). I downloaded <a href="https://www.kicad.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Kicad</a>, which is an open-source PCB
design tool, and got started. To my surprise, the process was much easier than I
thought and I could go from complete zero to ordering my PCBs online in a couple
of days.</p>
<p>The first step is to design the diagram, which means listing all components and
their connections in a schematic way. In my case, the diagram looks like the
following:</p>
<figure><div><p><img alt="An image" src="https://questdb.io/img/blog/2024-10-24/kicad-schema.webp" loading="lazy"></p><figcaption>Click to zoom</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The buttons are on the left-hand side. The microcontroller in the middle, the
display on the right. Other items include the speaker, the on-off button and the
battery management system which handles the lithium battery's charge and
discharge.</p>
<p>Once they are connected like this, the system knows I will need to route traces
between all these connector points, and we can start making the PCB.</p>
<p>To my surprise, the drawing of traces (the electrical connection between two
points) is done by hand. The schematic we just made only helps guiding
connections from one point to another and making sure all connections are
implemented.</p>
<p>So after designing the schematic, it was time to place the components on the
board and to draw the traces to join the related connectors:</p>
<figure><div><p><img alt="An image" src="https://questdb.io/img/blog/2024-10-24/kicad-pcb.webp" loading="lazy"></p><figcaption>Click to zoom</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>I was particularly pleased to find that I could leave some copper exposed to
display text. It's something I found visually attractive.</p>
<p>Anyways, once the components are placed on the board and the connections are
drawn, you can export gerber files which you can then upload on
<a href="https://www.pcbway.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">PCB Way</a> to order the boards. They arrived within 4
days which is impressive considering that their manufacturing involves many
steps, and that they shipped from China.</p>
<h3 id="3d-printed-case">3D printed Case<a aria-label="Direct link to 3D printed Case" title="Direct link to 3D printed Case" href="https://questdb.io/blog/making-a-trading-gameboy/#3d-printed-case">​</a></h3>
<p>Kicad allows us to export the PCB 3D model and footprint. This meant I could
design a case around it to 3D print later:</p>
<figure><div><p><img alt="An image" src="https://questdb.io/img/blog/2024-10-24/pcb-3d.webp" loading="lazy"></p><figcaption></figcaption></div></figure>
<p>What's nice is that you can import the model into something like Autodesk Fusion
360, and then design the case around it. In this instance, I projected the PCB
sketch imported from Kicad (the purple lines) and created a structure around it
using offsets from the Kicad drawing. I left some holes for the screws and used
the feature which automatically models the thread in 3D:</p>
<figure><div><p><img alt="An image" src="https://questdb.io/img/blog/2024-10-24/box-drawing.webp" loading="lazy"></p><figcaption></figcaption></div></figure>
<p>I designed this with the intent of leaving the PCB exposed, so the case was
simply covering the back of the PCB and the battery. The result is the simple
case displayed in red below which 3D-prints in half an hours or so:</p>
<figure><div><p><img alt="An image" src="https://questdb.io/img/blog/2024-10-24/case-view.webp" loading="lazy"></p><figcaption></figcaption></div></figure>

<p>As mentioned, there was a lot to improve in the first software iteration.</p>
<p>For this new one, I decided to start from scratch.</p>
<h3 id="reference-price">Reference price<a aria-label="Direct link to Reference price" title="Direct link to Reference price" href="https://questdb.io/blog/making-a-trading-gameboy/#reference-price">​</a></h3>
<p>The previous game model was based on a random walk of the price. I know, it's
not ideal. But I started this fetching real prices and I soon found that this
was not ideal for a game for a few reasons.</p>
<p>First, in the space of few minutes, the prices don't change that much. Creating
the reference price myself meant I could inject events such as market crashes
and whatnot to spice things up a bit.</p>
<p>Another consideration was that the API calls from the Pico took a long time, and
this was a blocking operation.</p>
<p>The model looks like the following:</p>

<p>Essentially, the whole game is based around a reference price, and that
reference price moves between two ticks following a random walk.</p>
<p>However, I introduced a figures concept whereby at certain moments, economic
figures are released, and the price jumps at that time. Then, markets are more
volatile (the price changes by a larger amount between two ticks), until such
point that it reverts to normal trading mode with standard volatility.</p>
<p>You can think of this reference price as the 'fair' price for the consensus of
market participants.</p>

<p>With a reference price, I can start constructing other concepts. In the previous
iteration, there was only one bid and offer, meaning the player always won the
trades.</p>
<p>Because of this, I simulated the effects of player actions (skew and spread) by
affecting the relative probabilities that a player would receive a trade on
either bid or offer sides at each tick.</p>
<p>In this iteration, I wanted to simulate the dynamics of a real orderbook and
queue position. In the real world, you only get the trade if you're first in the
queue, and I wanted a similar dynamic:</p>

<p>The logic is that traders can add orders to the bid and ask sides of the
orderbook. These are then stored in a heapq.</p>
<p>Since the micropython implementation only implements minheap, I had to store one
of the sides by taking the opposite of the price so that it would be stored in
the correct order. This is why some negative signs appear in the code suce as
this <code>-self.buy_orders[0][0] &gt;= self.sell_orders[0][0]</code>.</p>

<p>Having done this, I could start creating agents. These agents would, for
example, place orders randomly in the book with a price relative to the current
reference price:</p>

<p>The result of the above is a stream of orders coming on both sides of the
orderbook.</p>
<p>Some of these orders are resting, and populate the orderbook.</p>
<p>Some are crossing the spread, taking liquidity from the book, and resulting in
trade matches.</p>
<p>When a trade happens, both counterparties are notified, and the risk engine is
updated with the new positions.</p>
<p>This is a simple placeholder for now, but it's relatively easy to implement a
set of smarter agents, each with their own logic and incentives, including
competing market-makers, and arbitrageurs.</p>
<p>The player logic is different and more akin to controlling an algo:</p>

<p>The parameter <code>turn_latency</code> is so that a player's algo can only update quotes
periodically. This replicates the throttling implemented by exchanges whereby
traders cannot continuously update their quotes with every tick.</p>
<p>When the latency has elapsed, a few things happen:</p>
<ol>
<li>The current player quotes are cancelled with the exchange</li>
<li>New quotes are calculated using the current quoting parameters</li>
<li>The quotes are sent back to the exchange.</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition, other orders may be sent automatically to another market for
hedging if the player sets up their algo to automatically hedge the flow.</p>

<p>I decided to split the display into a bunch of sections which can be rendered
separately.</p>
<p>For example, here is the class displaying the current ref price on the screen.</p>

<p>So in this case, this is what displays the price in the top-right corner with a
value of 50.22:</p>
<figure><div><p><img alt="An image" src="https://questdb.io/img/blog/2024-10-24/display-price.webp" loading="lazy"></p><figcaption></figcaption></div></figure>
<p>There are multiple other sections like this. The one displaying the chart area,
the one with the controls, the news, the risk section, the market depth chart,
the orderbook table, the trades feed, and so on.</p>
<p>By rendering them independently, I can then place them relatively to one another
and potentially schedule their update cycles at different moments if needed.</p>

<p>It is really easy to program a microcontroller to react to a button press.
Connect the button, and write some micropython like the following:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>import</span><span> machine</span><br></span><span><span>button </span><span>=</span><span> machine</span><span>.</span><span>Pin</span><span>(</span><span>12</span><span>,</span><span> machine</span><span>.</span><span>Pin</span><span>.</span><span>IN</span><span>,</span><span> machine</span><span>.</span><span>Pin</span><span>.</span><span>PULL_UP</span><span>)</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>while</span><span> </span><span>True</span><span>:</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>    </span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>not</span><span> button</span><span>.</span><span>value</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>:</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>        </span><span>print</span><span>(</span><span>'Button pressed!'</span><span>)</span><br></span></code></pre></div>
<p>However when the program becomes larger, this approach stops working. One of the
reasons is that you may be pressing the button at the moment where the loop is
executing some other code.</p>
<p>By the time your code gets back to evaluating <code>button.value()</code>, you may have
released it. Ideally, you'd want your inputs to be immediately registered.</p>
<p>Another consideration is that button presses, from a signal perspective, are not
how one intuitively may think. Instinct tells us that the button is an on/off
switch, and therefore pressing it should look like the following:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span></span><br></span><span><span>____________|-----------------------|__________________</span><br></span><span><span>            ^                       v</span><br></span><span><span>          press                  release</span><br></span></code></pre></div>
<p>However, in practice, it looked more like the following.</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span></span><br></span><span><span>____________|-|_|-|_|-|_|--------|__________________</span><br></span><span><span>            ^                       v</span><br></span><span><span>          press                  release</span><br></span></code></pre></div>
<p>It seems like the signal needs to stabilise after a button press and may
oscillate initially, even if the button is pressed continuously. This has two
consequences.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, it means you may register several presses instead of one.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Second, depending on timing, your software may not register a button press if
the signal jumped to the low state at that exact time.</li>
</ul>
<p>To circumvent this, I used <code>interrupt requests</code> which will monitor a signal
change and interrupt execution to run the routine called by the button press. I
coupled this with a timeout to avoid processing the same button input multiple
times.</p>
<p>In this case, the trigger is the 'falling' edge of the signal:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>    </span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>__init__</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>)</span><span>:</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>        </span><span>from</span><span> machine </span><span>import</span><span> Pin</span><br></span><span><span>        self</span><span>.</span><span>last_change_ms </span><span>=</span><span> ticks_ms</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>        self</span><span>.</span><span>callbacks </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>}</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><br></span><span><span>        self</span><span>.</span><span>red_button </span><span>=</span><span> Pin</span><span>(</span><span>13</span><span>,</span><span> mode</span><span>=</span><span>Pin</span><span>.</span><span>IN</span><span>,</span><span> pull</span><span>=</span><span>Pin</span><span>.</span><span>PULL_UP</span><span>)</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>        self</span><span>.</span><span>red_button</span><span>.</span><span>irq</span><span>(</span><span>trigger</span><span>=</span><span>Pin</span><span>.</span><span>IRQ_FALLING</span><span>,</span><span> handler</span><span>=</span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>red_isr</span><span>)</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><br></span><span><span>    </span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>red_isr</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span><span> pin</span><span>)</span><span>:</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>        </span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>'RE'</span><span> </span><span>in</span><span> self</span><span>.</span><span>callbacks </span><span>and</span><span> time</span><span>.</span><span>ticks_diff</span><span>(</span><span>ticks_ms</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>,</span><span> self</span><span>.</span><span>last_change_ms</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>&gt;</span><span> BTN_FREQ_MS</span><span>:</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>            </span><span>print</span><span>(</span><span>f'</span><span>{</span><span>RED</span><span>}</span><span>BUTTONS</span><span>{</span><span>ENDC</span><span>}</span><span>: notifying button listener </span><span>{</span><span>RED</span><span>}</span><span>RED</span><span>{</span><span>ENDC</span><span>}</span><span>'</span><span>)</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>            self</span><span>.</span><span>callbacks</span><span>[</span><span>'RE'</span><span>]</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>            self</span><span>.</span><span>last_change_ms </span><span>=</span><span> ticks_ms</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><br></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Since the same button may have different functions depending on the context, for
example depending on which menu you are currently in, each button press is
triggering a callback.</p>
<p>Changes in menu context send a list of callbacks to override the previous one
and setup the new actions. I found this made the buttons more generic.</p>
<h3 id="ram-issues">RAM issues<a aria-label="Direct link to RAM issues" title="Direct link to RAM issues" href="https://questdb.io/blog/making-a-trading-gameboy/#ram-issues">​</a></h3>
<p>I quickly ended up with memory issues whereby the program would crash with an
error message such as <code>Memory allocation failed, failed to allocate 256 bytes</code>
or something like this.</p>
<p>What happened here is two things.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, 256kb is not so much</li>
<li>Second, it is relatively easy to end up with memory fragmentation.
Fragmentation means that I have enough bytes in memory to allocate to my
object, however these bytes are not contiguous and scattered across the memory
range making the allocation impossible.</li>
</ul>
<p>I watched a few videos from the creator of
<a href="https://micropython.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">MicroPython</a>, and read documentation online. This led
to a few discoveries which helped.</p>
<h4 id="using-const">Using const()<a aria-label="Direct link to Using const()" title="Direct link to Using const()" href="https://questdb.io/blog/making-a-trading-gameboy/#using-const">​</a></h4>
<p>Say you have config values which won't change at runtime. When defining them as
<code>LOOP_FREQUENCY_MS = 250</code>, this may create a variable which requires more
memory. In this example, the system may allocate 32 bits for an <code>int</code> whereas I
only need 8 bits.</p>
<p>In some instances, for example when writing <code>c = 22 ... a = b x c</code>, I now
understand the compiler may detect that 22 is a constant and therefore apply
this for you, but being explicit does not hurt.</p>
<h4 id="proactive-memory-defragmentation">Proactive memory defragmentation<a aria-label="Direct link to Proactive memory defragmentation" title="Direct link to Proactive memory defragmentation" href="https://questdb.io/blog/making-a-trading-gameboy/#proactive-memory-defragmentation">​</a></h4>
<p>MicroPython has a garbage collection mechanism which triggers automatically.</p>
<p>However, it may only trigger once the memory is already fragmented, and not be
able to help. When starting up the game, I create a lot of objects. As a result,
this may not immediately trigger a connection.</p>
<p>I used <code>gc.collect()</code> profusely at startup and found that this helps make sure
that whatever memory is consumed by my objects is packed tighter together to
reduce fragmentation and its effects down the line.</p>
<h4 id="precompiling">Precompiling<a aria-label="Direct link to Precompiling" title="Direct link to Precompiling" href="https://questdb.io/blog/making-a-trading-gameboy/#precompiling">​</a></h4>
<p>MicroPython is an interpreted language whereby the code you write is transformed
into bytecode at compilation time. However, this compilation happens at startup
on the board itself, and can leave a significant memory footprint behind.</p>
<p>As I was struggling with memory issues, I considered compiling ahead of time,
and copying the files to the board.</p>
<p>The compile script uses <a href="https://pypi.org/project/mpy-cross/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">mpy-cross</a> and
looks like this:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>#!/bin/sh</span><br></span><span><span></span><br></span><span><span>MPY_CROSS="mpy-cross/./mpy-cross"</span><br></span><span><span>SOURCE_DIR="."</span><br></span><span><span>BUILD_DIR="$HOME/build"</span><br></span><span><span></span><br></span><span><span>echo "### Starting build"</span><br></span><span><span></span><br></span><span><span>compile_to_mpy() {</span><br></span><span><span>    local src_file="$1"</span><br></span><span><span>    local dest_file="$2"</span><br></span><span><span>    mkdir -p "$(dirname "$dest_file")"</span><br></span><span><span>    $MPY_CROSS "$src_file" -o "$dest_file"</span><br></span><span><span>}</span><br></span><span><span></span><br></span><span><span>copy_file() {</span><br></span><span><span>    local src_file="$1"</span><br></span><span><span>    local dest_file="$2"</span><br></span><span><span>    mkdir -p "$(dirname "$dest_file")"</span><br></span><span><span>    cp "$src_file" "$dest_file"</span><br></span><span><span>}</span><br></span><span><span></span><br></span><span><span># Clear the build directory at the start</span><br></span><span><span>rm -rf "$BUILD_DIR"</span><br></span><span><span>mkdir -p "$BUILD_DIR"</span><br></span><span><span></span><br></span><span><span>echo "### Starting build"</span><br></span><span><span>find "$SOURCE_DIR" -type d -name "mpy-cross" -prune -o -type f -print | while read -r src_file; do</span><br></span><span><span>    relative_path="${src_file#$SOURCE_DIR/}"</span><br></span><span><span>    if [[ "$src_file" == *.py ]]; then</span><br></span><span><span>        dest_file="$BUILD_DIR/${relative_path%.py}.mpy"</span><br></span><span><span>        echo "### Compiling $dest_file"</span><br></span><span><span>        compile_to_mpy "$src_file" "$dest_file"</span><br></span><span><span>    elif [[ "$src_file" == *.txt ]]; then</span><br></span><span><span>        echo "### Copying raw $dest_file"</span><br></span><span><span>        dest_file="$BUILD_DIR/$relative_path"</span><br></span><span><span>        copy_file "$src_file" "$dest_file"</span><br></span><span><span>    fi</span><br></span><span><span>    if [[ "$src_file" == *ain.py ]]; then</span><br></span><span><span>        echo "### Copying raw $dest_file"</span><br></span><span><span>        dest_file="$BUILD_DIR/$relative_path"</span><br></span><span><span>        copy_file "$src_file" "$dest_file"</span><br></span><span><span>    fi</span><br></span><span><span>done</span><br></span></code></pre></div>
<p>This creates a set of <code>.mpy</code> files which are bytecode instead of the <code>.py</code>
files. Taking the compilation step from the board to the computer means less
memory usage and a faster startup time, although the onboard compilation is
quite quick and not noticeable.</p>
<h4 id="buffering">Buffering<a aria-label="Direct link to Buffering" title="Direct link to Buffering" href="https://questdb.io/blog/making-a-trading-gameboy/#buffering">​</a></h4>
<p>I have a few files such as a <code>.txt</code> containing information such as the list of
'fun' news to display during the game. I may be in situations where I cannot
load the file in memory in one go. So to avoid crashing when reading it, I count
the number of lines by reading it in a buffer:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>count_lines</span><span>(</span><span>file</span><span>)</span><span>:</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>    count </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>    </span><span>while</span><span> </span><span>True</span><span>:</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>        </span><span>buffer</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>file</span><span>.</span><span>read</span><span>(</span><span>1024</span><span>)</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>        </span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>not</span><span> </span><span>buffer</span><span>:</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>            </span><span>break</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>        count </span><span>+=</span><span> </span><span>buffer</span><span>.</span><span>count</span><span>(</span><span>'\n'</span><span>)</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>    </span><span>return</span><span> count</span><br></span></code></pre></div>
<p>In a similar way, I tried to steer clear of string variables and holding text in
memory as this can quickly accumulate when collecting objects with text. So
things like <code>side = 'buy'</code> would be transformed into <code>'side_is_buy: True</code> etc.</p>

<p>While I tried to be efficient, the game can be slow if not careful, even when
the microcontroller clocks 133 million times per second. In this section, we'll
look at some learnings which helped me make the game feel more fluid.</p>
<h4 id="multiprocessing">Multiprocessing<a aria-label="Direct link to Multiprocessing" title="Direct link to Multiprocessing" href="https://questdb.io/blog/making-a-trading-gameboy/#multiprocessing">​</a></h4>
<p>The first item is that the Pico has two cores, which means it can run two
processes in parallel. This means I can split the work two-ways and
theoretically do two things at the same time thereby (I simplify) run at twice
the speed.</p>
<p>One difficulty with multiprocessing is potential contention over resources. For
example, trying to modify a variable from one process while the other process is
reading it.</p>
<p>In this case, I decided to organise my two processes such that they are
independent. One runs the background game such as the exchange, bots, the
matching engine, and similar. The other handles the player side such as
rendering the game on screen, processing inputs, and so on.</p>
<p>The initialisation looks like this:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>### Within the main thread...</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>### Start second thread</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>second_thread </span><span>=</span><span> _thread</span><span>.</span><span>start_new_thread</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>second_thread</span><span>,</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>second_thread</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>)</span><span>:</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>    aio</span><span>.</span><span>create_task</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>exchange</span><span>.</span><span>flow</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>    aio</span><span>.</span><span>create_task</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>exchange</span><span>.</span><span>simulate_order_book</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>    aio</span><span>.</span><span>create_task</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>exchange</span><span>.</span><span>cash_market</span><span>.</span><span>flow</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>### Do something else with the first thread</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>from</span><span> game </span><span>import</span><span> Game</span><br></span><span><span>next_step </span><span>=</span><span> Game</span><span>(</span><span>resources</span><span>)</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>while</span><span> </span><span>True</span><span>:</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>    next_step </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>await</span><span> next_step</span><span>.</span><span>flow</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><br></span></code></pre></div>
<h4 id="coroutines">Coroutines<a aria-label="Direct link to Coroutines" title="Direct link to Coroutines" href="https://questdb.io/blog/making-a-trading-gameboy/#coroutines">​</a></h4>
<p>The game consists of many small loops. The bots send orders in a loop at a given
frequency. The player's algo reacts to market data at a given frequency. The
display refreshes at a given frequency; there are many such intervals.</p>
<p>Having all these steps in a loop such as this is not optimal because it forces
all steps to execute sequentially:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>while</span><span> </span><span>True</span><span>:</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>    loop1</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>    loop2</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>    </span><span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span><br></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Fortunately, micropython comes with a built-in implementation of <code>asyncio</code>.</p>
<p>This allows us to setup co-routines, then let them run at a given frequency by
using <code>await aio.sleep_ms(interval)</code>. This pauses the current co-routine and
opens up resources to schedule another co-routine whose execution is due.</p>
<p>Here is an example for the player turn loop, and asynchronous wait:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>async</span><span> </span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>play</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>)</span><span>:</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>    </span><span>while</span><span> self</span><span>.</span><span>playing</span><span>:</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>        self</span><span>.</span><span>rpm_price </span><span>=</span><span> self</span><span>.</span><span>exchange</span><span>.</span><span>rpm</span><span>.</span><span>get_ref_price</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>        self</span><span>.</span><span>player_turn</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>        </span><span>await</span><span> aio</span><span>.</span><span>sleep_ms</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>player_turn_ms</span><span>)</span><br></span></code></pre></div>
<p>What's nice about this is that we can then easily separate the loop frequencies
for all routines, and increase the frequency for critical ones, while decreasing
it for background tasks which don't need a high update rate. All frequencies can
then be setup as <code>Const()</code> in a config file.</p>
<h4 id="overclocking">Overclocking<a aria-label="Direct link to Overclocking" title="Direct link to Overclocking" href="https://questdb.io/blog/making-a-trading-gameboy/#overclocking">​</a></h4>
<p>It would not be a real trading machine if it was not overclocked! Overclocking
means increasing the CPU clock frequency over its default value, in this case
133 Mhz. Doing so is easy in micropython and I found that I could double the
clock frequency without any issues:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>from</span><span> machine </span><span>import</span><span> freq</span><br></span><span><span></span><span>from</span><span> config </span><span>import</span><span> OVERCLOCK_MHZ</span><span>,</span><span> MAX_OVERCLOCK_MHZ</span><span>,</span><span> OVERCLOCK</span><br></span><span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>async</span><span> </span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>main</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>:</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>    </span><span>if</span><span> OVERCLOCK </span><span>and</span><span> OVERCLOCK_MHZ </span><span>&lt;</span><span> MAX_OVERCLOCK_MHZ</span><span>:</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>        freq</span><span>(</span><span>OVERCLOCK_MHZ </span><span>*</span><span> </span><span>1_000_000</span><span>)</span><br></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Overclocking is not without risks however, and the CPU may become unstable or
overheat as a result. So increasing it is possible but with some risks and
downsides such as shortening the life of your device. But doubling the clock
speed in a situation such as this is a quick and easy way to get the performance
boost I need.</p>

<p>Generally, users are guided towards <a href="https://thonny.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Thonny</a> as an IDE. It
is great in many ways. The REPL mode allows you to connect to your board, modify
your code on the device, and run it.</p>
<p>While it's perfect for small scripts such as collecting readings or controlling
a small item, it becomes much more complicated when using more advanced objects,
classes, etc. There is no version control, and very few syntax checks or
highlights.</p>
<p>The process mostly looked like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Update a file on the Pico</li>
<li>Update another file</li>
<li>Save the first file</li>
<li>Run</li>
<li>Error message because the second file was not saved and therefore your code is
broken</li>
<li>Save the second file</li>
<li>Run</li>
<li>Get an error message because you made a small syntax error which was not
highlighted in the IDE</li>
</ul>
<p>A lot of issues I had at runtime were because of typos or small syntax issues
which IDEs equipped with syntax checks would catch instantly and highlight.</p>
<p>On the other hand, using a fully fledged IDE also makes life harder because you
lose the ability to browse and edit files on device. While this would have been
a no-go due to the annoying overhead of copying the code across many times over,
I found that using a small script helped a lot and rendered this step painless.</p>
<p>To that end, I used
<a href="https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/reference/mpremote.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">mpremote</a> to
copy all my files to the board and lastly start the program:</p>

<h2 id="does-it-questdb">Does it QuestDB?<a aria-label="Direct link to Does it QuestDB?" title="Direct link to Does it QuestDB?" href="https://questdb.io/blog/making-a-trading-gameboy/#does-it-questdb">​</a></h2>
<p>QuestDB is a monster for <a href="https://questdb.io/market-data/" rel="">market data</a>. The Pico microcontroller
includes a wireless chip. So it's possible to connect it to the network, and
then to issue http requests to send data to a QuestDB instance.</p>
<p>Connecting to the wifi is pretty simple in micropython:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>connect_to_wifi</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>)</span><span>:</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>  wlan </span><span>=</span><span> network</span><span>.</span><span>WLAN</span><span>(</span><span>network</span><span>.</span><span>STA_IF</span><span>)</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>  wlan</span><span>.</span><span>active</span><span>(</span><span>True</span><span>)</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>  wlan</span><span>.</span><span>connect</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>ssid</span><span>,</span><span> self</span><span>.</span><span>pwd</span><span>)</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>  </span><span>print</span><span>(</span><span>f'connecting </span><span>{</span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>ssid</span><span>}</span><span>'</span><span>)</span><br></span></code></pre></div>
<p>And then we can sending data using a raw HTTP request. For example something
like this:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>send_results</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>)</span><span>:</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>    query </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>f"INSERT INTO game(ref_price,timestamp, p_bid, p_ask, skew, pnl) "</span><span> \</span><br></span><span><span>            </span><span>f"VALUES("</span><span> \</span><br></span><span><span>            </span><span>f"</span><span>{</span><span>str</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>current_ref_price</span><span>)</span><span>}</span><span>,"</span><span> \</span><br></span><span><span>            </span><span>f"systimestamp(),"</span><span> \</span><br></span><span><span>            </span><span>f"</span><span>{</span><span>str</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>current_player_bid</span><span>)</span><span>}</span><span>,"</span><span> \</span><br></span><span><span>            </span><span>f"</span><span>{</span><span>str</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>current_player_ask</span><span>)</span><span>}</span><span>,"</span><span> \</span><br></span><span><span>            </span><span>f"</span><span>{</span><span>str</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>player_skew</span><span>)</span><span>}</span><span>,"</span><span> \</span><br></span><span><span>            </span><span>f"</span><span>{</span><span>str</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>player_pnl</span><span>)</span><span>}</span><span>)"</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>    full_url </span><span>=</span><span> self</span><span>.</span><span>url </span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>"?query="</span><span> </span><span>+</span><span> self</span><span>.</span><span>url_encode</span><span>(</span><span>query</span><span>)</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>    </span><span>print</span><span>(</span><span>full_url</span><span>)</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>    </span><span>try</span><span>:</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>        requests</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>url</span><span>=</span><span>full_url</span><span>)</span><br></span></code></pre></div>
<p>I can then setup a Grafana dashboard with queries such as the following:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>SELECT</span><span> </span><span>timestamp</span><span>,</span><span> ref_price</span><span>,</span><span> p_bid player_bid</span><span>,</span><span> p_ask player_ask</span><br></span><span><span></span><span>FROM</span><span> game</span><br></span><span><span></span><span>WHERE</span><span> $__timeFilter</span><span>(</span><span>timestamp</span><span>)</span><br></span></code></pre></div>
<p>And tada!</p>
<p>Game stats are flowing in realtime into a QuestDB instance and displayed live in
a <a href="https://questdb.io/docs/third-party-tools/grafana/" rel="">Grafana</a> dashboard. Of course, I
<a href="https://questdb.io/blog/increase-grafana-refresh-rate-frequency/" rel="">set the refresh frequency to 250ms</a>
for more of a true HFT feel:</p>
<figure><div><p><img alt="An image" src="https://questdb.io/img/blog/2024-10-24/game-on-grafana.webp" loading="lazy"></p><figcaption>Click to zoom</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>It's pretty satisfying to see the quotes adjusting automatically to market
price. With more time, I could change the algo to adjust to the orderbook, fight
for position, or come up with many other creative situations.</p>
<p>Another satisfying thing is to watch the autohedge get to work when I cross my
threshold parameter. This threshold is dynamic, meaning that I can adjust it
over the game depending on my current risk appetite. As soon as it's crossed, it
sends orders in the other orderbook to hedge in the underlying.</p>
<p>What's less satisfying is my performance in this game. In this instance, it was
all going well until figures occurred. I was making money from the spread
collected on the flow. But when figures came out, I had a small short
position... and the markets jumped up.</p>
<p>Consequently, my PnL went from positive to negative. While I remembered to pull
quotes (I would have been demolished by arbitrage otherwise because I have
higher latency than the market), I didn't completely flatten my position.</p>
<p>I'll do better next time!</p>
<h2 id="in-conclusion">In conclusion<a aria-label="Direct link to In conclusion" title="Direct link to In conclusion" href="https://questdb.io/blog/making-a-trading-gameboy/#in-conclusion">​</a></h2>
<p>While accidental, this experience was very enriching for a few reasons.</p>
<p>First, as someone who always worked in dematerialised things (data, trading,
computers), it was great to work on something tangible and physical. There is a
pleasure in creation and this opened new perspectives in terms of daring to do
things with my hands such as fixing something at home or building.</p>
<p>I naturally feel more at home with a computer than with a hammer, and people in
the opposite situation tell me they are scared of computers. It's great to
realise that going from one to the other is possible, and feels great.</p>
<p>Second, I was amazed to discover 3D printers and CAD design. The state of
tooling is such that one can very easily design a part (PCB or other physical
object) to solve real world problems with infinitely more satisfaction than just
buying something off-the-shelf.</p>
<p>For example, my bedside table lamp comes with shades, and there is a set of two
disks which screw on the lamp shaft to hold the shade in place. These broke, and
within a few minutes I could print replacements for a fraction of the cost with
multiples of the satisfaction.</p>
<p>Most people I know have never seen such a machine before and I envy them for
their ability to see it in action for the first time materialising an object
before their eyes.</p>
<p>Third, I am truly impressed by the Raspberry Pi Pico, and the micropython
language. When I think microcontroller, I think toothbrush control or small RC
remote. But seeing it run an exchange, orderbook, matching engine, and
refreshing a display for a cost of around $8 is truly impressive.</p>
<p>They just released a new version with more cores, more memory, and other
features, and I can't wait to try it for other projects and to see what more
skilled makers will make of it!</p>

					<p>Over the past two decades, Google has hosted two different internal platforms for predictions. Why did the first one fail — and will the other endure?</p>
				<div>
											<div><p>It’s July 2005. Google is the darling of Silicon Valley. It has just unveiled Google Maps; Gmail is still in beta. Next year it will acquire YouTube and launch Google Translate.</p><p>The week’s new hires file past a full-size dinosaur skeleton in the courtyard on the way to their first TGIF — the company’s weekly all-hands. They wear beanies with red, yellow, green, and blue colors — like the yet-to-be-designed Chrome logo — with a propeller on top. They are here to see Google’s founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, both wearing shorts and plain colored t-shirts, banter about new tech.</p><p>In the first line of their Founders’ IPO letter, Page and Brin wrote “Google is not a conventional company.” They sought to provide “unbiased, accurate and free access to information.” On this Friday, Patri Friedman, the grandson of Milton Friedman, and Bo Cowgill, now an economics professor at Columbia University, are here to talk about Google’s next bet to do this: an internal prediction market called Prophit.</p><p>On stage next to Larry Page, Friedman and Cowgill announce winners from Prophit’s first quarter and show statistical results on its forecasting accuracy. Prophit was popular inside Google. Over the next three years, about 20% of all Google employees would place bets.</p><p>Two months after this presentation, <em>The </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/26/business/at-google-the-workers-are-placing-their-bets.html"><em>New York Times</em> covered Prophit</a>. They wrote about it again <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/07/technology/07link.html">in 2008</a>, and it became a <a href="https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=34562"><em>Harvard Business Review</em> case-study</a>. Despite the momentum, in March 2010, Prophit hit a major roadblock in its public launch as an external product. It attempted a pivot, and ultimately shut down in 2011.</p></div>

  </p>
  </figure>
</div>
											<div><p>In April 2020, almost exactly 15 years after Prophit launched, and one month after employees worldwide were sent home due to COVID-19, I launched Google’s second internal prediction market, called Gleangen.<sup>

    <span id="fnref-1">

    <!-- </a> -->
</sup>
 By late 2022, about 8% of Google employees had placed a bet on Gleangen. The company had grown so large that 8% represented 15,000 people — ten times the number of employees that placed bets on Prophit. Gleangen sustained over 1,000 monthly traders, more than the popular forecasting platforms <a href="https://www.metaculus.com/">Metaculus</a> (where I later served as CTO) and <a href="https://manifold.markets/stats">Manifold</a> at the time.<sup>

    <!-- </a> -->
</sup>
</p><p>Outside of Google, prediction markets have once again been thrust into the spotlight. Weeks before it became a mainstream view, users on sites like PredictIt and Metaculus predicted not only that President Biden would drop his reelection campaign but that <a href="https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/prediction-markets-suggest-replacing">doing so would increase the Democrats’ chance of winning</a>. Over the next few months, swings in election prediction markets regularly made national news,  and despite some distortions caused by aggressive whales, the markets <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-06/donald-trump-win-betting-markets-prediction-websites-nailed-election-forecast?cmpid=BBD110724_MONEYSTUFF&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_term=241107&amp;utm_campaign=moneystuff&amp;embedded-checkout=true">ultimately </a><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-06/donald-trump-win-betting-markets-prediction-websites-nailed-election-forecast?embedded-checkout=true">performed</a><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-06/donald-trump-win-betting-markets-prediction-websites-nailed-election-forecast?cmpid=BBD110724_MONEYSTUFF&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_term=241107&amp;utm_campaign=moneystuff&amp;embedded-checkout=true"> well</a>. Theoretically, prediction markets are equally powerful when used by companies to anticipate events, such as predicting their competitors’ next moves.</p><p>But as Cowgill has shown, corporate prediction markets have <a href="https://academic.oup.com/restud/article-abstract/82/4/1309/2607345?login=false">a mixed track record</a>, as evidenced by attempts at Google and many other companies. Why is this? What does it take to make them work? The inside story of Prophit and Gleangen, the two largest corporate prediction markets ever run, offers some lessons.</p></div>
											<p><h2>A new type of information economy</h2>
</p>
											<div><p>Probably the first corporate prediction market was built in 1990 by economist Robin Hanson for employees of the doomed hypertext startup Project Xanadu. It had 18 participants, who bet on questions like whether cold fusion would be developed by 1991. The decade was dotted with other prediction market experiments, like the Iowa Electronic Markets (an online real money prediction platform established in 1988) and Hollywood Stock Exchange (a 1996 virtual market for film-related options).</p><p>Researchers like Hanson and others, such as the economist Justin Wolfers, worked out some of the implementation details from this data. Crucially, they also showed that most markets — whether operating with either real or play money — were relatively accurate, much more so than even the most accurate individuals. In 2004, the journalist James Surowjecki published the widely-read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wisdom_of_Crowds"><em>The Wisdom of Crowds</em></a>, detailing cases where collective judgment surpassed individual expertise. Cowgill read the book the same year, and decided to start a prediction market at Google.</p><p>The company had some key ingredients to make a market work. First, it had a culture open to experimentation. Googlers were famously permitted 20% of their working hours to experiment on new products.<sup>
    <!-- <a id="fnref-3" href="#fn-3"> -->
    <span id="fnref-3">
        3    </span>
    <!-- </a> -->
</sup>
 Cowgill posted his idea for “Google Decision Markets” on a message board. Engineers Ilya Kirnos, Doug Banks, and Piaw Na responded to help, and Patri Friedman joined the project a few months later.</p><p>A second ingredient was Google’s economic expertise. Hal Varian, Google’s chief economist then and now, wrote <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Rules">the book</a> on the economics of the internet, and helped design Google’s famous ad auction system. On Hal’s suggestion, the Prophit team used the prediction market structure first <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2117471">described</a> by economists at the University of Iowa and based on the Iowa Electronic Markets.<sup>

</sup>
</p><p>Prophit launched to Google employees in April 2005. Market prices were featured on the company intranet home page. It was an immediate hit.</p></div>
											<p><h2>Betting for fun and profit</h2>
</p>
											<div><p>In Google’s early days, long before it became a blue-chip stock, its offices were full of LEGOs, ball-pits, and Magic the Gathering cards. Product design mirrored office design, and Google built applications full of bright colors, easter eggs, and April Fools’ jokes.</p><p>Prophit was such a product: serious with a dash of whimsy. Markets tracked over 60% of all Google quarterly objectives, such as “How many Gmail users will there be by the end of Q2?” Some questions aimed to predict its competitors' next moves, such as “Will Apple launch a computer based on Intel's Power PC chip?” Yet one third of all markets were marked as “fun,” of interest to employees but with no clear connection to Google’s business (e.g., the quality of Star Wars Episode III or gas prices).</p><p><a href="https://funginstitute.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/CorporatePredictionMarkets1.pdf">Cowgill</a> told me an anecdote of both the seriousness and the whimsy. A senior executive saw Prophit give a very low probability that the company would complete the hire of a new senior executive on time (filling the position had been a quarterly objective for the past six quarters). “The betting on this goal was extremely harsh. I am shocked and outraged by the lack of brown-nosing at this company,” the executive said to laughter in a company-wide meeting. But the market was the nudge the execs needed. They subsequently “made some hard decisions” to complete the hire on time.</p><p>The crowd of Googlers produced accurate predictions, spurred by competition for $10,000 of awards each quarter, plus the even-more-valuable prestige of the leaderboards. In a <a href="https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/services.google.com/en//blog_resources/google_prediction_market_paper.pdf">2009 paper</a> which analyzed the first 2.5 years of Prophit, Cowgill found that the platform demonstrated high calibration that improved over time. (It wasn’t perfect. There was an optimism bias — bettors thought positive outcomes for Google would happen more often than they actually did.<sup>

 There were also strong correlations in the bets made by people who sat within a few feet of each other.)</p><p>But that was just Prophit’s internal beta. The product was designed to launch externally, not to be an internal decision-making tool. It was meant to become Google’s next world-changing innovation in information technology.</p></div>
											<p><h2>Economists vs. the United States</h2>
</p>
											<div><p>Google pioneered many now standard tech practices: on-site cafés, A/B tests, and “dogfooding,” or first releasing new products internally where they can be improved before launching to the public.&nbsp;</p><p>Prophit was a logical next step in the company's mission to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful. That included all the world’s books, all the world’s roads, and all the world’s languages — why not all the information in the heads of the world’s humans? Prediction markets offered a mechanism to systematically elicit reliable information from human judgment. Cowgill relayed to me what happened next, a previously unreported chapter in the Prophit story.&nbsp;</p><p>The biggest obstacle preventing Prophit’s public launch was the inconvenient fact that online gambling was (mostly) illegal, and the laws surrounding it were not uniform across states. States attorneys general could claim Prophit fell within their jurisdiction, requiring Google to adhere to 50 different state policies.<sup>

</p><p>Prophit, along with Google’s legal and policy teams, developed a strategy to convince a federal regulator to pre-emptively assert jurisdiction over Prophit. It was Google’s opinion that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission would be the most natural and friendly regulator, in part because the CFTC had already issued a "<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/sites/default/files/files/foia/repfoia/foirf0503b004.pdf">no action letter</a>" protecting the Iowa Electronic Markets<sup>

 back in 1993. In May 2008, the CFTC <a href="https://www.cftc.gov/LawRegulation/FederalRegister/e8-9981.html">published </a>a letter expressing concerns about the potential overlap between prediction markets and gambling, but left the door open for possible exemptions, and invited public comments on how to regulate such markets..</p><p>The CFTC staffed many economists, and they seemed to understand the moment. That same month, an article called <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1157679"><em>The Promise of Prediction Markets</em></a> appeared in the prestigious journal <em>Science</em>, arguing that prediction markets held too much research and decision-making potential to be fettered by government restrictions. Its authors included four Nobel laureates in economics, numerous academic proponents of markets (including Philip Tetlock, Robin Hanson, and Robert Forsythe), as well as Google’s own Hal Varian.</p><p>Google hired a lobbying firm with extensive CFTC ties. They also organized support from Yahoo! and Microsoft, where prediction markets had been popular among senior executives. The three companies, despite their rivalry in their core markets, <a href="https://www.cftc.gov/sites/default/files/idc/groups/public/@lrfederalregister/documents/frcomment/08-004c029.pdf">jointly</a> <a href="https://www.cftc.gov/sites/default/files/idc/groups/public/@lrfederalregister/documents/frcomment/08-004c031.pdf">backed</a> a single proposal for the CFTC to legalize prediction markets. In March 2010, Cowgill and Ilya Kirnos, another of Prophit’s creators, went to Washington to lobby this proposal to the CFTC, as well as officials in the White House and Congress.</p><p>But by the time the CFTC digested Google's proposal, the political appetite for financial deregulation had changed. The 2008 financial crisis hit its peak with the collapse of Lehman brothers in September. In the interim years, many had come to blame the crisis on the lack of oversight of new financial products. In July 2010, just a few months after Cowgill and Kirnos’s visit to Washington, the Dodd-Frank Act was passed, overhauling nearly all federal financial regulatory agencies. According to Googlers working on Prophit in DC and Mountain View, despite Silicon Valley’s organized push, the intellectual momentum for regulatory reform had died.</p></div>

</div>
											<div><p>As the meetings in DC stalled, so too did progress back in Mountain View. Cowgill told me that it became hard to get resources to continue lobbying — and, crucially, engineering headcount to support the external launch. This put Prophit in limbo.&nbsp;</p><p>Although internally successful, without a path to a public launch, it underwent a surprising — if brief — pivot. Cowgill had by that point joined Hal Varian’s economics team, where he tried to implement prediction markets within different projects. One such project was a social network for Chinese users because Google Plus (Google’s attempt at a social network) was blocked there. Cowgill, together with engineers in Chinese offices, integrated Prophit’s engine to power a forecasting feature in the app. But it failed to take off, and Google later killed the project.&nbsp;</p><p>By that point, most of Prophit’s core team had moved on. Friedman left in 2008 to start the Seasteading Institute. Banks and Na left Google in 2010. Kirnos kept running markets until the last ones paid out in mid-2011 and left in 2012 for a startup that was later acquired by Twitter. Cowgill started a PhD in Economics at Berkeley. “I regret that we shut down Prophit,” he wrote to the Prophit group in 2012. “We should have treated the internal instance as a product in its own right, not as a stepping stone to going public.”</p></div>
											<p><h2>The flow of information at Waymo</h2>
</p>
											<div><p>I’d been fascinated by prediction markets since I graduated college in 2011. I read about Prophit, and I was influenced by the same intellectual momentum that had brought Cowgill and Kirnos to Washington. I joined Google in 2014, where I worked first on Google Search and then on Google Translate. In early 2018, I had been promoted twice to Senior Software Engineer, and I began looking for new opportunities.</p><p>I dug up all the code and internal emails on Prophit that I could find. Cowgill’s e-mail expressing regret for not pursuing Prophit as an internal-only app caught my attention. Why not build a new prediction market, I thought, only this time designed <em>from the beginning</em> to influence decision making inside Google?</p><p>I met with Cowgill, Friedman, and Varian. All three expressed reservations about trying again — as did my friends from other divisions, whom I would need to help me pitch Area 120, Google’s in-house incubator for full-time “20% projects,” to staff “Prophit 2.0.” And so I set the idea aside and instead found a role on the systems engineering team at the self-driving car company Waymo. But while at Waymo, I quickly found a concrete use case for a prediction market.<br>Waymo’s systems engineering team measured safety through a variety of metrics from real driving, simulated driving, and models. Yet this data was fragmented — different orgs across the 1,000 person company had different access levels, and worse, different definitions for what they were measuring.</p><p>I was working on a new metric modeling the chance of collision from a particular maneuver. I spoke with engineers about how their projects might improve safety as measured by this metric. Opinions differed widely. And this was crucial information — engineering prioritization at the highest level depended on expectations of which potential projects would most likely improve safety of various car maneuvers.</p><p>I realized I could get the most accurate assessments of the likely impact of projects by aggregating the predictions of the crowd of engineers. And I could envision how these predictions could change priorities in practice, thanks to two famous stories of goals in Waymo’s history, the two “Founder’s Challenges.”</p><p>In the first, in early 2009, Larry Page <a href="https://waymo.com/blog/2020/04/in-the-drivers-seat-1000-mile-challenge/">challenged</a> what was then known as Project Chauffeur to complete 10 different autonomously driven 100-mile routes in California within two years. The team succeeded with three months to spare. Page’s second challenge, issued in 2015, was for Waymo to provide 1,000 driverless rides per week within one year. On this challenge, the company fell far short. By 2020, five years later, the company was still only completing about <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/sdc-prod/v1/safety-report/Waymo-Public-Road-Safety-Performance-Data.pdf">50-200 such rides each week</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>This reminded me of Cowgill’s anecdote about the senior manager who used Prophit to intervene on a failing initiative. I imagined what would have happened if the second Founder’s Challenge had had a company-wide betting pool on when the milestone would be met. Might a Waymo executive have done what the early Google executive had done — intervened when the probability of success dropped, asked bettors why the outcome was in doubt, and changed course?</p><p>I decided to build a prediction market to find out, using my team’s safety metrics as the targets to forecast. I made a prototype, onboarded employees, sourced predictions, got UX feedback, and iterated. Once I had minimal liquidity, I presented the resulting forecasts to every senior manager that would take a meeting.</p><p>In 2019, although Waymo had by then become a separate company from Google, it was in many ways still attached. It had never moved out of the warehouse it shared with Google X. It used the same HR system and the same tech stack. I even continued to use my Google laptop and Google badge.&nbsp;</p><p>In one key way, though, Waymo was not like Google. Access to data was much more restricted.</p><p>Prophit worked, in part, because of internal transparency. When a market forecast how many Gmail users would join next quarter, it was based on a value that was visible to everyone at Google. Google was famously internally transparent compared to other tech giants.</p><p>One Waymo VP, upon seeing these safety metric forecasts, said this would help communicate these metrics across company divisions. And then, to my amazement, he said this was counter to his division’s goal to <em>restrict</em> information like this. The core mechanism of prediction markets — using the wisdom of crowds — can be antithetical to the common management desire to control who knows what.<sup>

</sup>
</p><p>I failed to find any management support for the prediction market. But I had seen the potential. Less than one year after joining Waymo, I searched Google job listings for the role most aligned with forecasting, got a role on the supply chain forecasting team, and transferred back to the mothership.</p></div>

											<p><h2>The end of Google’s 20% culture</h2>
</p>
											<div><p>In early February 2020, one month after I started my new role, I saw a question on Metaculus asking if a new coronavirus <a href="https://www.metaculus.com/questions/3530/how-many-people-will-die-as-a-result-of-the-2019-novel-coronavirus-covid-19-before-2021/">might lead</a> to a global pandemic. One month later, all 150,000 Alphabet employees were sent home. Demand for information surged, and management didn’t have answers. So I used my extra time in lockdown to revamp and relaunch what I was now calling Gleangen as a prediction market for all Google employees.</p><p>Early markets, bet on by thousands of employees, centered on our uncertain future: when offices would re-open in various countries, the date vaccines would be available, and how at-home and in-office work would be balanced. Several times, such markets gave high probabilities to the creation of pandemic policies long before they were actually enacted.</p><p>My main challenge in making Gleangen a useful internal tool for strategy was generating enough users, bets, and liquidity on markets about Google’s core businesses. Over the next 18 months, while working my day job in supply chain forecasting, I wrote, predicted, and resolved over a thousand such markets. I grew a mailing list and chat group, and hosted socials, unconferences, and talks. As Prophit had done, I got approval to pay out valuable prizes to complement the play-money leaderboards. I posted links to Gleangen on so many internal memes that people told me to stop. I once spent an entire weekend hanging flyers in every bathroom I could access across dozens of buildings in campuses across the Bay Area.&nbsp;</p><p>I never presented at TGIF, though Google CEO Sundar Pichai did answer a TGIF question about a Gleangen market. And while the time for puff pieces from <em>The</em> <em>New York Times</em> about Google had long passed, I did manage to get approval to write a <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/solutions-how-tos/design-patterns-in-googles-prediction-market-on-google-cloud">public piece</a> in December 2021 that — while mostly an ad for Google Cloud — explained the basics of prediction markets, highlighted Gleangen’s over 10,000 users, and included screenshots of the interface.</p><p>Like Prophit, Gleangen only got official staffing after achieving success from its incubation during engineers’ “20% time.” It was official company policy that all Google employees in good standing could work on projects of their choosing one day per week, as long as they were for the benefit of Google. Internal job postings listed hundreds of 20% project opportunities.</p><p>But by 2020, despite no change in official policy, the concept of 20% time at Google was on life-support.<sup>

    <span id="fnref-9">
        9    </span>
    <!-- </a> -->
</sup>
 None of the three managers I had during this phase approved of me spending one day a week on Gleangen. (Neither did any of the over 20 other 20% contributors I recruited to administer the site, add features, and manage contests.) Gleangen became my full-time job in early 2022.&nbsp;</p></div>
											<p><h2>The wisdom of the Googler crowd</h2>
</p>
											<div><p>From the beginning, my plan was to learn from Cowgill, Friedman, and Varian’s experience — and mistakes — with Prophit. “The plan we executed was to focus on having as much adoption, buzz, and usage by employees as possible,” Cowgill told me. “Google was making choices about public products based on buzz and adoption, with the mantra of ‘user growth now, monetize later.’” What they didn’t do, he said, was sell their product to decision-makers the way one might sell enterprise decision support software. “That's probably how it should be done,” he said, ”with lots of consulting and oversight of each application and client.”</p><p>So I ran pilots to produce useful forecasts for division after division, from Nest to the Quantum Computing team. While most managers were supportive, few were willing to allocate resources.</p><p>I was well aware of the known obstacles to prediction market adoption in the workplace: unwillingness to share data, the desire for plausible deniability when projects fail, the risks of market manipulation, and good old-fashioned status quo bias. But in hindsight, my almost three-year struggle before I got official staffing for Gleangen came down to poor execution on exactly what Cowgill advised: understanding client needs. I had a somewhat utopian view of the value of information. I put some, but not enough, effort into figuring out the messy details on how to operationalize the wisdom of Googlers into a valuable resource for managers.</p><p>Even in cases where managers wanted explicit probabilistic forecasts, a prediction market turned out to be a tough sell. I tried to launch an initiative to use Gleangen to augment the forecasts Google made to drive purchasing decisions of computers, power, and land for its data centers. There was a seemingly strong need for accuracy in the forecasts — too high, and Google could spend hundreds of millions of dollars overprovisioning; too low, and core Google products like Adwords could run out of resources.</p><p>Most managers of the supply chain forecasting teams accepted the premise that Gleangen would improve accuracy. But accuracy wasn’t their top priority. Supply chain forecasts were produced and used by many teams totalling hundreds of people.&nbsp; Managers were incentivized to improve the forecasting process’ transparency, adjustability, accountability, and interoperability with other systems. They didn’t stand to benefit much even if Gleangen did improve the final accuracy of the forecasts. And my initiative exposed them to risk of disrupting many of the subtler roles the process provided, such as value judgments on which parts of Google’s business should get scarce data center resources. I didn’t offer to serve their real needs as if they were enterprise customers, as Cowgill had advised.</p><p>This challenge of operationalizing the wisdom of the Googlers came to a climax when we began forecasting perhaps the most important development in Google’s recent history: large language models.</p></div>
											<p><h2>Forecasting AI</h2>
</p>
											<div><p>Shortly after Gleangen launched in April 2020, I read OpenAI’s technical report on GPT-3. By early 2022, I was convinced that properly developing LLMs was the most important challenge Google faced. This was a chance to use collective intelligence to improve the chance of success of an important outcome.</p><p>I met with the leads of the core LLM teams inside Google Research, then called <a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/lamda/">LaMDA</a>. Together we devised two types of markets: technical LLM milestones and the integration of LLMs in Google products. We secured a budget to incentivize extra participation with prizes and launched the “LLM Forecasting Contest.”</p><p>Six months into the contest, OpenAI released ChatGPT. Its success sent Google’s top executives scrambling. Most employees close to the development of LLMs, and those who used LaMDA internally, were much less surprised than management. But at a company as large as Google, information — even critical information — sometimes doesn’t percolate up to the top.</p><p>This was exactly the sort of problem I’d built Gleangen to solve. But, to my dismay, I realized we hadn’t produced the information executives really needed. We asked questions of the type “Will Google integrate LLMs into Gmail by Spring 2023?” and “How many parameters will the next LaMDA model have?” Yet what executives would have wanted to know was “Will <em>Microsoft</em> integrate LLMs into <em>Outlook</em> by Spring 2023?” and “How many parameters will the next <em>GPT</em> model have?”</p><p>This turns out to be a general lesson from running a corporate prediction market. Forecasting internal progress, and acting on that information, requires solving complex operational problems and understanding the <a href="https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2020/05/23/mazes-sequence-summary/">moral mazes</a> that managers face. Forecasting competitors’ progress has almost none of these problems.</p><p>It’s conceivable that many executives would have consulted Gleangen in 2022 for forecasts on Microsoft, OpenAI, and Anthropic. This could have enshrined the wisdom of the Googler crowd as a critical source of information, giving individual employees an ability to directly influence senior management by contributing high-quality information. It could have delivered on Friedman and Cowgill’s original vision of prediction markets as part of Google’s core mission: organizing the information inside people’s heads and making it systematically useful.</p><p>We learned from this experience. Gleangen became a staffed part of Google’s Behavioral Economics team shortly after this LLM forecasting contest started. I left Google in October of 2022 to serve as the CTO of Metaculus, but as of August 2024, the team continues to refine its approach to make Gleangen a useful source of information for Google senior management.</p></div>

											<p><h2>Looking to the future</h2>
</p>
											<div><p>As <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/dQhjwHA7LhfE8YpYF/prediction-markets-in-the-corporate-setting">Nuño Sempere, Misha Yagudin, and Eli Lifland wrote in 2021</a>, a successful corporate prediction market needs to cost less than the value of information it produces. I see the path forward in two improvements to this cost-benefit analysis. First, it must present leadership with more valuable information. All the examples of predictions in this article — executive hires, self-driving car safety metrics, COVID-19 workplace policies, datacenter costs, and LLM progress — could be useless or pivotal, depending on the process around it and the needs of the internal customer.</p><p>Second, AI could make the forecasts cheaper to produce. Sarah Pratt, a researcher at DeepMind, and members of the Gleangen team released a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04446">paper</a> in June which compared bettors on Gleangen to predictions from PaLM 2, an LLM developed by Google. In brief, that paper — as well as several others recently released — show AI forecasts are much better than chance, but not nearly as accurate as a human crowd, at least not yet. Their paper also highlights another way AI helps with the cost-benefit of corporate prediction markets: they increase the value of the wisdom of the human crowd by using it for evaluation, and perhaps soon the training, of AI systems.</p><p>As the economists, engineers, and researchers running corporate prediction markets improve this value proposition, they may realize the now decades-old vision of Bo Cowgill and others. They are buoyed by the popularity of real-money public markets like Polymarket and Kalshi.<sup>

 At the Manifest conference this summer, run by the prediction market Manifold, Keri Warr, a member of the technical staff at Anthropic, announced that Anthropic has launched an internal prediction market with a “focus on decision-makers.” Time will tell whether Anthropic’s employees, in concert with Claude, will produce information that helps steer the direction of the company — and if so, whether more companies will follow them.&nbsp;</p></div>
