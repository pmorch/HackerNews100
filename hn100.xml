                        <p>Ford announced this week that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/ford-kills-project-develop-tesla-like-electronic-brain-2025-04-30/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">it is merging FNV4</a>, its project to develop a next-generation electrical architecture designed to unlock new functionality and upgradeability for both EVs and internal-combustion cars, with its existing architecture, seemingly confirming reports that the project has not gone as planned. It’s another in a long, long line of false starts in the race for legacy automakers to develop true “<a href="https://insideevs.com/features/755649/software-defined-vehicle-explainer-101/" data-inline-widget="internal-links" data-type-id="0" data-params="%7B%22article_edition_id%22%3A%22755649%22%2C%22section%22%3A%223%22%2C%22alias%22%3A%22software-defined-vehicle-explainer-101%22%7D">software-defined vehicles</a>” (SDVs), and further proof of just how hard the task is.</p>
<p>It’ll be worth the effort. Software-first architectures reduce costs, increase flexibility and—perhaps most importantly—allow automakers to move faster, without being slowed down by a complex web of suppliers creating their own code. Though becoming a leader in SDVs will be just as challenging as becoming an electric vehicle powerhouse, it’s also equally important. Consumers have had it with clunky, slow automotive technology, and the modern car is so computerized that a seamless electronic interface is an absolute necessity.</p>
<p>None of the legacy automakers has solved this problem yet. All of them have thrown billions at it. Only some of them will complete the transformation.</p>

<h2><span><svg><use xlink:href=""></use></svg></span>What Is A Software-Defined Vehicle?</h2>
<p><a href="https://insideevs.com/tesla/" data-inline-widget="internal-links">Tesla</a> invented the software-defined vehicle with the launch of the original <a href="https://insideevs.com/tesla/model-s/" data-inline-widget="internal-links">Model S</a>. While previous cars had plenty of software onboard, they all used a different approach. Electronic control units (ECUs) with supplier-sourced software would control groups of features or individual modules. Cars would have one computer handling, say, HVAC systems, and another for the lighting. Each of these computers was networked via <a href="https://www.csselectronics.com/pages/can-bus-simple-intro-tutorial" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CAN bus</a>, an old-school network with limited bandwidth.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Updates were done at dealers, and since that process was expensive, automakers only updated things when they had to, for safety, security or reliability reasons. This meant that software had to be fully validated and finalized before the product entered production, according to Sam Abuelsamid, vice president of market research at auto intel firm Telemetry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But Tesla changed the game. The Model S was designed from the get-go to be updatable over-the-air, and since it didn’t rely on legacy suppliers, it used far fewer ECUs than its competitors. Most software duties were handled by a centralized computer, with only certain safety-critical systems getting their own computers. This simplified wiring, reduced production costs and allowed Tesla to make the car better over time.</p>
<p>The updatability was both broad and deep. One example Abuesamid offers: When the <a href="https://insideevs.com/tesla/model-3/" data-inline-widget="internal-links">Model 3</a> first came out, it took far too long to stop in <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/hybrids-evs/tesla-model-3-review-falls-short-of-consumer-reports-recommendation/#:~:text=Editor's%20Note%3A%20In%20response%20to,more%20affordable%20mass%2Dmarket%20car." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Consumer Reports testing</a>, thanks to bad anti-lock braking system (ABS) calibration. Tesla was able to fix this with a software update over the air, something no one else could do for a braking system. That was impressive, but the example presented a worrying question: Did engineers not do stopping-distance testing before they shipped the car to customers?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

    <p>The Tesla Model 3 brought the SDV to a mass-market audience, but its early quality issues show why the move-fast and fix-it-later approach can be problematic.</p>
    
</section>
<p>Thus, the double-edged sword of SDVs. They are more upgradeable and flexible than their predecessors, but that advantage allows companies to deliver under-baked software with a “fix it later” approach.</p>
<h2><span><svg><use xlink:href=""></use></svg></span>Teething Issues</h2>
<p>Evidence of that dichotomy is not hard to find. As automakers have introduced vehicles with more advanced computing and electrical architectures, they have also struggled to deliver bug-free software on time.</p>
<p>General Motors <a href="https://insideevs.com/features/709703/gm-ultium-problems-software-batteries/" data-inline-widget="internal-links" data-type-id="0" data-params="%7B%22article_edition_id%22%3A%22709703%22%2C%22section%22%3A%223%22%2C%22alias%22%3A%22gm-ultium-problems-software-batteries%22%7D">provided America’s most salient example</a>.

That allows for more networked features, including things like Super Cruise hands-free driving and key modules that can be updated over-the-air. But troubles with the platform also ruined the launch of products like the <a href="https://insideevs.com/gmc/hummer-ev/" data-inline-widget="internal-links">Hummer EV</a>, <a href="https://insideevs.com/reviews/729569/cadillac-lyriq-ev-review-2024/" data-inline-widget="internal-links" data-type-id="0" data-params="%7B%22article_edition_id%22%3A%22729569%22%2C%22section%22%3A%222%22%2C%22alias%22%3A%22cadillac-lyriq-ev-review-2024%22%7D">Cadillac Lyriq</a> and <a href="https://insideevs.com/chevrolet/blazer-ev/" data-inline-widget="internal-links">Chevy Blazer EV</a>.

<p>Volvo also struggled with scaling its platform. It’s proud of the fact that the <a href="https://insideevs.com/volvo/ex90/" data-inline-widget="internal-links">EX90</a> and <a href="https://insideevs.com/news/740089/volvo-ex30-us-debut-price/" data-inline-widget="internal-links" data-type-id="0" data-params="%7B%22article_edition_id%22%3A%22740089%22%2C%22section%22%3A%221%22%2C%22alias%22%3A%22volvo-ex30-us-debut-price%22%7D">EX30</a> are true software-defined EVs. They have a centralized computing system, a simpler electrical architecture and a software stack that is designed to get better continuously. But delivering it was a nightmare. The company delayed the EX30 and EX90, and then shipped them with <a href="https://insideevs.com/reviews/729645/volvo-ex30-dies-during-review/" data-inline-widget="internal-links" data-type-id="0" data-params="%7B%22article_edition_id%22%3A%22729645%22%2C%22section%22%3A%222%22%2C%22alias%22%3A%22volvo-ex30-dies-during-review%22%7D">plenty of bugs</a> and <a href="https://insideevs.com/reviews/731827/2025-volvo-ex90-first-drive/" data-inline-widget="internal-links" data-type-id="0" data-params="%7B%22article_edition_id%22%3A%22731827%22%2C%22section%22%3A%222%22%2C%22alias%22%3A%222025-volvo-ex90-first-drive%22%7D">missing features</a>. Still, the Volvo EX30, EX90 and related Polestar 4 are SDVs you can buy in the U.S. today.</p>
<p>Ford’s FNV4 was its next big move, and according to Abuelsamid, it was supposed to be out already. The platform was going to underpin vehicles like Ford’s planned electric three-row SUV, which the company <a href="https://insideevs.com/news/730891/ford-three-row-electric-suv-dead/" data-inline-widget="internal-links" data-type-id="0" data-params="%7B%22article_edition_id%22%3A%22730891%22%2C%22section%22%3A%221%22%2C%22alias%22%3A%22ford-three-row-electric-suv-dead%22%7D">abruptly canceled last year.</a> According to Abuelsamid, the software wasn’t ready. Now, some improvements from FNV4 are being folded into Ford’s existing FNV3 architecture.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Still, Abuelsamid says Ford’s current position is “way better than it was two years ago.”</p>
<p>Then there’s Volkswagen, which made a big bet on software development with its captive software arm, Cariad. Despite the early start and plenty of money, though, <a href="https://insideevs.com/news/753673/vw-group-cariad-billions-losses-2024/" data-inline-widget="internal-links" data-type-id="0" data-params="%7B%22article_edition_id%22%3A%22753673%22%2C%22section%22%3A%221%22%2C%22alias%22%3A%22vw-group-cariad-billions-losses-2024%22%7D">Cariad was a disaster</a>.

But Volkswagen needs to learn how to do this itself, so relyihng on others isn’t the best option in the long run.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As for everyone else, they’re all a few years away from having any proper SDVs on the road. Stellantis has been cautious with its rollout, but it’s working hard on its STLA Brain project.

<p>Japanese and Korean companies remain further behind. Hyundai and Kia are transitioning to more software-driven vehicles, but their existing products feel a generation behind what GM’s doing and two generations behind Tesla. Toyota has brought much of its software team in-house and set up a major operation in the U.S., but is far from offering a true SDV.

<p>All of these future products will likely have teething issues. Because even with deep pockets, this is not an easy transition. But automakers need to push through if they want to create affordable, upgradeable EVs with streamlined user experiences. As customers of Rivian, Tesla and many Chinese brands have proven, once you use a true <a href="https://insideevs.com/news/677548/brand-loyalty-is-dying-but-not-tesla/" data-inline-widget="internal-links" data-type-id="0" data-params="%7B%22article_edition_id%22%3A%22677548%22%2C%22section%22%3A%221%22%2C%22alias%22%3A%22brand-loyalty-is-dying-but-not-tesla%22%7D">SDV you rarely go back to a legacy product</a>. It’s a smoother, more modern experience.</p>
<h2><span><svg><use xlink:href=""></use></svg></span>Why It’s So Hard</h2>
<p>From the outside, it may be hard to understand why creating a software-defined vehicle is still hard in 2025. These legacy companies have poached big hitters from Apple, Tesla and Google. They’ve sunk billions into it. They have decades of experience with software-controlled modules. From the clouds, it all seems doable.</p>
<p>Yet on the ground, it’s a nightmare. Automakers are not redesigning software. They are reworking how their entire organizations approach software.</p>
<p>These are companies that have typically seen software as a problem to be solved, not a design to be experienced. Engineers at GM, Ford and Toyota have spent decades using an approach to software that was silo’d, minimally tolerant of risk and designed to remain unchanged through the vehicle’s 20-year life cycle.</p>

<p>Now, they need to make compelling apps, slick new features and all-new electrical architectures that neither the companies nor their suppliers are used to using. They need to build Tesla-level upgradeability with far less willingness to ship unfinished goods, all while tucking it behind a military-grade firewall to ensure your car can’t be remotely hacked.</p>
<p>“The challenging part is these companies need to merge their development philosophies,” Abuelsamid says, keeping the safety-first mindset while also getting faster, more creative and bolder.</p>
<p>Plus, as Ford SDV project boss <a href="https://www.theverge.com/ford-motor-company/661205/ford-doug-field-interview-software-zonal-domain-fnv4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Doug Field tells <em>The Verge</em></a>, slower-than-expected EV sales mean they need to build systems that can also work with internal-combustion vehicles. That’s a major challenge, as EVs have a big battery that can power their electronics round-the-clock, enabling big over-the-air updates. When you only have a puny 12-volt to keep things moving, you’re going to run out of juice pretty quick.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, they have to navigate all of these issues while not scaring off customers. GM has been more aggressive and, I’d argue, successful with SDVs than competitors, but <a href="https://insideevs.com/reviews/726471/gm-carplay-cadillac-lyriq-review/" data-inline-widget="internal-links" data-type-id="0" data-params="%7B%22article_edition_id%22%3A%22726471%22%2C%22section%22%3A%222%22%2C%22alias%22%3A%22gm-carplay-cadillac-lyriq-review%22%7D">its anti-Apple CarPlay</a> stance has also scared off plenty of buyers. Plus, as automakers have moved more controls into their central displays, they’ve faced more consumer complaints and confusion.</p>
<h2><span><svg><use xlink:href=""></use></svg></span>So Who Wins?</h2>
<p>The clear leaders here are the companies that weren’t already locked into the old-world approach to automotive software. Tesla, Rivian, Lucid and almost all of the Chinese automakers have built ground-up systems that work without legacy bloat.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Rivian's software may not be as great as Tesla's, but it's far ahead of legacy automaker tech.</p>
    
</section>
<p>Everyone else is having to stumble their way towards that future, with varying levels of success. GM had the most high-profile struggles, but like BMW with early iDrive, the company’s willingness to stick it out seems to have produced an organization that’s ahead of its legacy peers on software. But it remains to be seen whether the company can take its approach further down the path to true SDVs.</p>
<p>BMW and Mercedes are close to launching theirs, while the fruits of the VW-Rivian deal and Ford’s “skunkworks” next-gen EV project remain further out. As for the Korean and Japanese companies, all of the hard work is still ahead of them.</p>
<p>Tesla proved that a software-defined vehicle was a viable and desirable product. Chinese automakers proved that the software-first approach could be replicated and improved upon. Now, we need a legacy automaker to prove that you can turn a century-old hardware brand into a true software company. It’s possible, but we know now that it won’t be easy.</p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>A year after claiming that its AI chatbot could do the work of </span></span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.customerexperiencedive.com/news/klarna-generative-ai-customer-service-call-center/709072/"><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>700 representatives</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></a><span><span><span><span><span><span>, Klarna is turning back to people to handle more of its customer service work.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>The buy now, pay later firm now wants customers to always have the option to speak with a human, Klarna spokesperson </span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Clare Nordstrom</span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span> told CX Dive.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>“While Klarna pioneered the use of AI in customer service </span></span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://url.us.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/V8saC5ylW5FpMv6OqSzf3fkS7op?domain=klarna.com/"><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>with groundbreaking results</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></a><span><span><span><span><span><span>, this strategy will now evolve to the next level,” Nordstrom said in an email. “AI gives us speed. Talent gives us empathy. Together, we can deliver service that’s fast when it should be, and emphatic and personal when it needs to be.”</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>



<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>It’s a drastic change from a year ago, when the firm went all in on AI, </span></span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c80e1gp9m9zo"><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>laid off workers</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></a><span><span><span><span><span><span> and </span></span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-12/klarna-stopped-all-hiring-a-year-ago-to-replace-workers-with-ai?sref=Hhue1scO"><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>paused hiring</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></a><span><span><span><span><span><span>. The shift highlights the need for the option to speak to a human in customer service — and to use AI as a supplement, not a replacement, for staff, according to </span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Julie Geller</span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>, principal research director at Info-Tech Research Group.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>“The key takeaway is that AI should augment human agents — not replace them,” </span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Geller</span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span> said in an email. “Automate the routine to drive efficiency, but always ensure customers have a clear, easy path to a human, especially when emotions or complexity come into play.”</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Klarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski</span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span> said just as much in an </span></span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-08/klarna-turns-from-ai-to-real-person-customer-service?sref=Hhue1scO"><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>interview with Bloomberg</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></a><span><span><span><span><span><span> Thursday.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>“From a brand perspective, a company perspective … I just think it’s so critical that you are clear to your customer that there will be always a human if you want,” Siemiatkowski said.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Klarna is now recruiting workers for what Siemiatkowski referred to as an Uber-type customer service setup. Starting with a pilot program, the firm will offer customer service talent “competitive pay and full flexibility to attract the best,” with staff able to work remotely, according to Nordstrom.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>“AI solves the easy stuff — our experts handle the moments that matter,” Nordstrom said. “That’s why we’re running this pilot, bringing in highly educated students, professionals and entrepreneurs for a new kind of role that blends frontline excellence with real-time product feedback.”&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>One of the goals is to replace the thousands of workers that Klarna currently outsources, Siemiatkowski told Bloomberg.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>


<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Back in February 2024, Klarna touted impressive figures: The AI assistant had taken over </span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>two-thirds </span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>of customer service chats —</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span> 2.3 million</span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span> in total — in its first month. Its handling of customer service chats resulted in average resolution times of </span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>less than 2 minutes</span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>The AI still plays a crucial role, according to Nordstrom. The chatbot still handles two-thirds of all customer inquiries. Since launch, response times have improved by </span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>82%</span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>, and Klarna has seen a </span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>25%</span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span> drop in repeat issues.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>“But in a world of automation, nothing is more valuable than a truly great human interaction. That’s why we’re doubling down — investing in the human side of service: empathy, expertise, and real conversations,” Nordstrom said.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Like many companies, Klarna had turned to AI as a form of cost-cutting, Siemiatkowski told Bloomberg.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>“Initially, Klarna embraced AI with an eye toward cost savings and efficiency — but perhaps underestimated the tradeoff,” Geller said. “As customers increasingly voiced frustration over impersonal interactions and limited access to human help, it became clear this approach risked undermining the very experience they aimed to improve. That kind of friction doesn’t just erode satisfaction; it carries real financial and reputational consequences.”</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Siemiatkowski acknowledged that Klarna had gone too far in the wrong direction with AI.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>“As cost unfortunately seems to have been a too predominant evaluation factor when organizing this, what you end up having is lower quality,” Siemiatkowski told Bloomberg. “Really investing in the quality of the human support is the way of the future for us.”</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>The firm’s shifting customer service strategy is perhaps unsurprising considering consumers’ overall frustrations with chatbots and the technology’s shortcomings.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>A Verint survey released last year found more than two-thirds customers have had a </span></span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.customerexperiencedive.com/news/consumer-frustration-self-service-live-agent-ivr-chatbot/724620/"><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>bad chatbot experience</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></a><span><span><span><span><span><span>, and in that group, the top complaint was inability to answer questions.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Customers still </span></span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.customerexperiencedive.com/news/consumers-human-connection-speed-customer-service/743364/"><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>want to talk to humans</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></a><span><span><span><span><span><span>, especially for complex or sensitive issues. A Five9 survey from March found that </span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>86%</span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span> of customers believe empathy and human connection are more important than a quick response in providing excellent customer experience.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>AI can mimic emotional intelligence in simple, routine interactions, Geller said.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>“But when situations get more complex, subtle gaps can start to show,” she said. “AI can also misread customer intent, leading to irrelevant — or worse, misleading — responses that frustrate people instead of solving their issue. And when companies lean too heavily on automation, they risk building rigid systems that make customers feel trapped, with no clear way to reach a human when it matters most.”</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>While Klarna has been an early, vocal adopter of AI, Geller is encouraged to see Klarna’s leadership course-correct from its earlier all-or-nothing approach.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>“They recognized that trust and satisfaction aren’t purely transactional — they’re emotional,” she said. “And to sustain loyalty, especially in complex or sensitive moments, customers still expect, and deserve, the option of a human touch.”</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

                This is an overview of the major techniques used to make web sites and web applications
                without making use of build tools or frameworks, with just an editor, a browser, and web standards.

                Specifically, that means these topics:

                This tutorial is meant for those who already know their way around HTML, CSS and JavaScript. If you're just starting out learning web development and are looking for resources to get going, then this is not the site for you yet.

            <h2>
                Wait, but why
            </h2>
            <p>
                Modern web development frameworks are powerful in their ability to develop rich well-structured web applications quickly,
                and for this reason alone they are well worth your time to learn.
                However, this rich functionality comes at the cost of framework and tooling complexity,
                and the resulting projects often require regular maintenance to keep secure and up to date.
            </p>
            <p>
                The plain vanilla style of web development makes a different choice,
                trading off a few short term comforts for long term benefits like simplicity and being effectively zero-maintenance.
                This approach is made possible by today's browser landscape, which offers excellent web standards support.

                    Pirate site blocking orders issued against DNS resolvers including OpenDNS, Google, and Cloudflare are stacking up in Europe. Since similar demands may eventually surface in other countries, including the U.S., we take a look at how these companies respond to blocking orders. Our research reveals that their responses differ quite a bit, which adds to an already confusing situation.
        </p>
      </div><div>
        <p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/stop-danger.jpg" alt="stop danger" width="300" height="220">The frontline of online piracy liability keeps moving, and core internet infrastructure providers are increasingly finding themselves in the crosshairs.</p>
<p>For rightsholders, site blocking remains the go-to response in many cases. Until recently, the majority of blockades were implemented by consumer ISPs, but expanded legal efforts are now targeting standalone DNS resolvers. </p>
<p>Over the past year, courts in <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/french-court-orders-cloudflare-to-dynamically-block-motogp-streaming-piracy-250405/">France</a>, <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/court-orders-google-to-poison-public-dns-to-prevent-iptv-piracy-250321/">Italy</a>, and <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/dazns-new-pirate-iptv-blocking-order-confidential-secret-sauce-250502/">Belgium</a> have ordered OpenDNS, Cloudflare, and Google to alter their responses to certain DNS queries. Instead of leading visitors to the domains of pirate sites, the companies are required to intercept queries and redirect them elsewhere. </p>
<p>The main rationale for targeting public DNS resolvers is their growing use for bypassing blocking measures rolled out by Internet providers. However, the American tech companies now being targeted are not happy with the role of ‘Internet police’ and appeals of these orders are still pending.</p>
<h2>OpenDNS Says Farewell</h2>
<p>While these legal battles play out in court, the DNS resolvers still have to comply one way or another. This has resulted in different responses, with Cisco’s OpenDNS taking by far the most drastic action.</p>
<p>When OpenDNS was first ordered to block pirate sites in France, the company made a <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/opendns-suspends-service-in-france-due-to-canal-piracy-blocking-order-240629/">simple but drastic</a> decision to leave the country entirely, effectively affecting all French users. Last week, it <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/opendns-quits-belgium-under-threat-of-piracy-blocks-or-fines-of-e100k-per-day-250416/">repeated this response</a> in Belgium following a similar court order. </p>
<p>Instead of blocking access to more than 100 sports piracy sites, as the Belgian order requires, OpenDNS announced its departure; at least temporarily.  </p>
<p>“Due to a court order in Belgium requiring the implementation of blocking measures to prevent access within Belgium to certain domains, the OpenDNS service is not currently available to users in Belgium,” the company <a href="https://community.cisco.com/t5/security-knowledge-base/opendns-service-currently-not-available-to-users-in-belgium/ta-p/5283479/redirect_from_archived_page/true#M18273">said</a>. </p>
<h2>Cloudflare Complies Using ‘Alternate Mechanisms’</h2>
<p>Not all DNS resolvers take such drastic measures. Cloudflare chooses to comply with court orders in its own way. Cloudflare DNS (1.1.1.1) users who try to access the targeted domains in countries where blocking orders are issued, see the following notice instead. </p>
<center><em>Error HTTP 451</em></center><br><center><picture loading="lazy" decoding="async">
<source type="image/webp" srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/livescooerclou.jpg.webp 1032w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/livescooerclou-300x165.jpg.webp 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px">
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/livescooerclou.jpg" alt="cloudflare blocked" width="600" height="330" srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/livescooerclou.jpg 1032w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/livescooerclou-300x165.jpg 300w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/livescooerclou-600x330.jpg 600w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/livescooerclou-150x82.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px">
</picture>
</center>
<p>Interestingly, Cloudflare maintains in its <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/cloudflare-blocked-400-sports-piracy-domains-in-france-last-year-250303/">transparency report</a> that it is not blocking content through its public DNS resolver. Instead, it points out that it uses “alternate mechanisms”.</p>
<p>“Given the extraterritorial effect as well as the different global approaches to DNS-based blocking, Cloudflare […] identified alternate mechanisms to comply with relevant court orders. To date, Cloudflare has not blocked content through the 1.1.1.1 Public DNS Resolver,” the company writes.   </p>
<center><em>Not Blocked</em></center><center><br></center><center><picture loading="lazy" decoding="async">
<source type="image/webp" srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/dns-blocked.jpg.webp 900w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/dns-blocked-300x54.jpg.webp 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px">
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/dns-blocked.jpg" alt="not blocked" width="600" height="109" srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/dns-blocked.jpg 900w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/dns-blocked-300x54.jpg 300w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/dns-blocked-600x109.jpg 600w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/dns-blocked-150x27.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px">
</picture>
</center>
<p>The result for Cloudflare DNS users appears to be the same, however. Those who try to access the blocked domains in the applicable countries will be redirected to the HTTP 451 error. </p>
<p>The good news is that affected users are informed about the reason for this technical blockade via the <a href="http://lumendatabase.org/">Lumen Database</a>. That doesn’t appear to be the case with Google. </p>
<h2>Google’s DNS Blackout</h2>
<p>After running tests in both Belgium and France, using various blocked domains, it’s clear that the targeted websites are no longer accessible through Google’s public DNS resolver (8.8.8.8). However, unlike Cloudflare, there is no notification whatsoever. </p>
<p>Instead, Google appears to simply refuse the DNS query, which means that the domain lookup is not linked to any IP address.</p>
<center><em>Query refused</em></center><br><center><picture loading="lazy" decoding="async">
<source type="image/webp" srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/refused.jpg.webp 739w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/refused-300x32.jpg.webp 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px">
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/refused.jpg" alt="refused" width="600" height="63" srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/refused.jpg 739w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/refused-300x32.jpg 300w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/refused-600x63.jpg 600w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/refused-150x16.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px">
</picture>
</center>
<p>While this is effective in the sense that the pirate sites are no longer available, it’s not very transparent. Users who try to access the domains will simply see a browser error, which could be caused by various DNS issues. </p>
<center><em>Not resolved</em></center><br><center><picture loading="lazy" decoding="async">
<source type="image/webp" srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/livesoccerblocked.jpg.webp 1034w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/livesoccerblocked-300x191.jpg.webp 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px">
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/livesoccerblocked.jpg" alt="google blocked" width="600" height="383" srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/livesoccerblocked.jpg 1034w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/livesoccerblocked-300x191.jpg 300w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/livesoccerblocked-600x383.jpg 600w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/livesoccerblocked-150x96.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px">
</picture>
</center>
<p>Google’s basic response is not limited to the recent Belgian court order. We observed the same query refusal for domain names that were included in French blocking orders over the past several months.</p>
<h2>Transparency is Paramount</h2>
<p>While the different responses from DNS resolvers are interesting, Google’s approach doesn’t make blocking efforts more transparent. These orders are still relatively new, so it’s possible that the company is working on offering more transparency in the future, but currently it only adds to the confusion. </p>
<p>Google’s response also appears to go against the advice of the Belgian court, which required the DNS providers to redirect users to a dedicated page, presumably to provide further detail.</p>
<center><em>Redirect</em></center><br><center><picture loading="lazy" decoding="async">
<source type="image/webp" srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/redirect.jpg.webp 1089w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/redirect-300x32.jpg.webp 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px">
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/redirect.jpg" alt="redirect" width="600" height="64" srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/redirect.jpg 1089w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/redirect-300x32.jpg 300w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/redirect-600x64.jpg 600w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/redirect-150x16.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px">
</picture>
</center>
<p>If these blocking orders are upheld by various courts, a more streamlined approach will be welcome. Interfering with DNS is a big step that can’t be taken lightly, so transparency is paramount. That’s relevant for the United States too, where a new <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/new-bill-aims-to-block-foreign-pirate-sites-in-the-u-s-250129/">site-blocking bill</a> also proposes public DNS resolver blockades.</p>

			<p>Venture capital is screwed. A bubble in AI is their last hope, and they’re betting everything on Sam Altman. It’s heartwarming.</p>
<p>Today, we have the Pitchbook-NVCA Venture Monitor for Q1 2025. This is the National Venture Capital Association telling its members how things are going. It’s the view of VC from the inside. The front cover picture is the light at the end of the tunnel — and it’s an oncoming streetcar. [<a href="https://nvca.org/pitchbook-nvca-venture-monitor/"><i>NVCA</i></a><i>; </i><a href="https://nvca.org/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=get_viewer&amp;file=https%3A%2F%2Fnvca.org%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2025%2F04%2FQ1-2025-PitchBook-NVCA-Venture-Monitor-19001.pdf#key=dGhlbWVNb2RlPWN1c3RvbSZ0b29sYmFyPXRydWUmbGF6eUxvYWQ9ZmFsc2UmcG9zaXRpb249dG9wJnByZXNlbnRhdGlvbj10cnVlJmRvd25sb2FkPXRydWUmY29weV90ZXh0PXRydWUmYWRkX3RleHQ9dHJ1ZSZkcmF3PXRydWUmZG9jX3JvdGF0aW9uPXRydWUmYWRkX2ltYWdlPXRydWUmZG9jX2RldGFpbHM9dHJ1ZSZzZWxlY3Rpb25fdG9vbD0wJnNjcm9sbGluZz0tMSZzcHJlYWRzPS0xJnpvb21faW49dHJ1ZSZ6b29tX291dD10cnVlJmZpdF92aWV3PXRydWUmYm9va21hcms9dHJ1ZSZmbGlwYm9va190b29sYmFyX3Bvc2l0aW9uPWJvdHRvbSZjdXN0b21Db2xvcj0lMjMzMzMzMzM="><i>NVCA</i></a><i>, PDF</i>]</p>
<p>We covered the <a href="https://pivot-to-ai.com/2024/10/21/venture-capital-is-having-a-bad-time-and-ai-isnt-going-to-fix-it/">Q3 2024 report</a> last year. That one tried very hard to present bad news as okay news. The new report can’t even do that.</p>
<p>Here is the state of venture capital in early 2025:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Venture capital is moribund except AI.</li>
<li aria-level="1">AI is moribund except OpenAI.</li>
<li aria-level="1">OpenAI is a weird scam that wants to burn money so fast it summons AI God.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Nobody can cash out.</li>
</ul>
<p>The report mostly blames venture’s woes on President Trump and his tariffs — but venture capital’s problems are systemic and you could see them coming since the zero-interest-rate era.</p>
<p>And they have <i>no idea</i> how to fix this. None at all. The report’s <i>only</i> plan for the future is to cross their fingers and hope.</p>

<h3>Trump’s tariffs have trashed everything</h3>
<p>The Trump economic disaster is the most important material fact for the venture capital sphere. The report goes on and on about the tariffs.</p>
<p>Here’s the first paragraph of the report:</p>
<blockquote><p>With uncertainty dominating US financial markets throughout the first quarter, our prior expectation that 2025 would see a resurgence in venture capital (VC) liquidity and dealmaking has been dimmed. Should the latest iteration of tariffs stand, we expect significant pressure on fundraising and dealmaking in the near term as investors sit on the sidelines and wait for signs of market stabilization.</p></blockquote>
<p>That is: nobody is doing deals because business can’t make plans past lunchtime.</p>
<p>The report somehow fails to mention the bit where the Silicon Valley VC and executive crowd worked their backsides off to elect Trump and several of them sat in the front row at his inauguration. Then they were actually surprised when the leopard ate their faces too.</p>

<p><a href="https://pivot-to-ai.com/2025/05/03/in-2025-venture-capital-cant-pretend-everything-is-fine-any-more/zirp-2005-2025-page/" rel="attachment wp-att-4272"><img decoding="async" src="https://pivot-to-ai.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/zirp-2005-2025-page.webp" alt="" width="1762" height="691" srcset="https://pivot-to-ai.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/zirp-2005-2025-page.webp 1762w, https://pivot-to-ai.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/zirp-2005-2025-page-300x118.webp 300w, https://pivot-to-ai.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/zirp-2005-2025-page-1024x402.webp 1024w, https://pivot-to-ai.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/zirp-2005-2025-page-768x301.webp 768w, https://pivot-to-ai.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/zirp-2005-2025-page-1536x602.webp 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1762px) 100vw, 1762px"></a></p>

<h3>The end of zero interest</h3>
<p>VC is hilariously unable to cope with not being in a zero-interest-rate environment.</p>
<p>In 2008, the global financial crisis hit. Central banks use interest rates as the brakes on an economy, so they took the brakes off to make sure money kept flowing around. Interest rates went below 1%. And interest stayed near zero for over a decade. [<a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FEDFUNDS"><i>St Louis Fed</i></a>]</p>
<p>But zero interest meant that if you <i>had</i> to get returns — say, you’re a pension fund — then there weren’t a lot of places to invest. Venture capital was one place you could put money and get returns.</p>
<p>This meant a flood of money into startups, and that meant all sorts of ridiculous startups got funding. Businesses that lost money on every transaction. SoftBank was setting money on fire as fast as possible, ending in the disaster of WeWork.</p>
<p>Borrowing money was almost free as well. Why not load up on debt?</p>
<p>But then inflation came along, and the Fed put interest rates back up — and suddenly there was less money. Why put money into venture capital when you could get back 5% just buying Treasury bills?</p>
<p>Venture capitalists were around before 2008 — including a lot of the current guys! — but it’s like they completely forgot how to do anything without free money. The party’s over, and now it’s time for the hangover.</p>
<p>So we get hyped up tech bubbles praying for lottery-level returns — because ordinary business returns from, say, making a thing and selling it don’t cut it. Our present hype-fueled AI bubble is a complete worked example.</p>
<h3>Everything is OpenAI</h3>
<p>This year, the investors are all-in on AI. Crypto’s still dead, quantum isn’t taking off — AI’s the last game in the casino. [<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/23/here-are-the-19-us-ai-startups-that-have-raised-100m-or-more-in-2025/"><i>TechCrunch</i></a>]</p>
<p>There’s lots of graphs in this report showing healthy dollar amounts. These are mostly the <a href="https://pivot-to-ai.com/2025/04/02/openai-signs-its-40-billion-deal-with-softbank-or-maybe-30-billion-probably/">“$40 billion” OpenAI deal led by Softbank</a>, and then the other AI startup deals. Almost all the graphs and statistics in this report are lies based on the one huge OpenAI outlier.</p>
<p>Andreessen Horowitz is right now <a href="https://pivot-to-ai.com/2025/04/10/a16z-raising-fresh-20b-for-ai-bubble-investments/">raising a fresh $20 billion investment fund</a> to try to keep the AI bubble going.</p>
<p>VCs still believe the marketing brochure version of AI, because they don’t actually know anything about technology:</p>
<blockquote><p>Just as “internet” evolved from buzzword to business backbone, AI is following the same playbook.</p></blockquote>
<p>No it isn’t! A completely different thing taking off and working says nothing about whether your personal favourite thing will take off and work! Stop saying dumb things!</p>
<p>Pitchbook says: “57.9% of global VC dollars invested in Q1 went to AI and machine learning startups.” Most of that’s OpenAI. Even Pitchbook calls it “FOMO” — fear of missing out. [<a href="https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/ai-startups-57-9-percent-global-venture-dollars-fear-of-missing-out-drives-up-dealmaking-q1-2025"><i>Pitchbook</i></a>]</p>
<p>AI is the only prospect for a lottery-level win. You and I know that’s not going to happen, but the VCs and their customers, the investors, do not know that. They’re still in. Where else are they gonna go?</p>
<h3>Everything that isn’t AI is moribund</h3>
<p>There’s a world of startups outside AI, and in 2025, they’re not having fun. Investors do not want to put money into early-stage startups with nothing to show as yet:</p>
<blockquote><p>First-time financing activity remains low, reflecting broader trends across the VC industry. In Q1, we recorded $3.8 billion invested across 892 deals, which was down both QoQ and YoY.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>… Only $10 billion was raised across 87 VC funds, setting a pace for the lowest year of fundraising in a decade.</p></blockquote>
<p>Early-stage firms that do get venture funding tend to get acquired early on, instead of doing more rounds to pump their imaginary value number first.</p>
<p>Even when a fund gets investors, it can hardly find anywhere to put the money. One VC firm, Charles River Ventures, returned $275 million of uncommitted capital to its investors. And wasn’t that a shock to the world of VC. [<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/02/technology/crv-vc-fund-returning-money.html"><i>NYT</i></a><i>, </i><a href="https://archive.is/YiiDi"><i>archive</i></a>]</p>
<h3>Number must go up</h3>
<p>These companies have mostly imaginary valuations — say they pay $10 million to get 1% of a company, that makes the company worth a billion dollars, right? And not the ten million of actual money it’s got.</p>
<p>The VCs jealously guard these imaginary valuations as big fat book entries they can trade with each other. Just don’t ever look inside the box, don’t test what the market with actual dollars thinks the value is.</p>
<p>A pile of startups just ran out of cash and died in 2024 — more than in 2023. And 2025 is expected to be even worse. [<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/26/2025-will-likely-be-another-brutal-year-of-failed-startups-data-suggests/"><i>TechCrunch</i></a>]</p>
<p>A lot of these were frankly trash companies funded a few years ago, and they should have died then. But VC still had the startups’ imaginary values on their books and they didn’t want to admit the startups were worthless until they were forced to.</p>
<h3>Nobody can cash out</h3>
<p>AI is the only thing that’s catching the eye of the investors. The investors don’t want to put their money into other areas because they’re just not getting payouts.</p>
<p>Here’s the simple version of venture capital investing:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">A VC firm starts a fund.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Big investors — pension funds, insurance companies, sovereign wealth funds, super-rich family offices — put money into the fund.</li>
<li aria-level="1">The VC firm puts the money into startups that will progress to an exit — an initial public offering or a bigger company buying them out.</li>
<li aria-level="1">The investors get paid. Hooray!</li>
</ul>
<p>Most startups fail, but one big winner can make up for a pile of losers.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the stock market is broken — the Trump tariffs again — so IPOs are not popping on launch, so they’re not happening.</p>
<p>CoreWeave, riding the AI buzz for all it was worth, was the big public exit in first quarter 2025, and that one fell flat because their numbers were objectively terrible and their business plan doesn’t work. Ed Zitron has covered CoreWeave at length. But even with all that, CoreWeave on its own was 40% of all first quarter exits by value. [<a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/core-incompetency/"><i>Where’s Your Ed At</i></a>]</p>
<p>The other big exit was Wiz Security getting bought by Google. But as the report says, “the rest of the exit market has remained relatively silent.”</p>
<p>Funding rounds are increasingly late-stage — that is, VCs are mostly putting extra money into existing companies, often just to keep them on life support.</p>
<p>Many of these later funding rounds also have secondary sales — where startup employees get to sell some equity to the new investors. Because then the talent might not give up and quit to work at a non-zombie. And the old investors get some money back from a company that’s not doing anything.</p>
<h3>The future of venture capital</h3>
<p>The report’s theme for the future is: hope really hard! Maybe markets will recover and IPOs will pop again. Maybe Trump will come up with a coherent plan and stop being volatile and weird. Maybe!</p>
<p>That’s it. That’s all the plan they have. These guys haven’t got a clue what to do next. They really don’t. This is the industry talking to itself and saying “well gosh, chaps, looks like we’re screwed.”</p>
<p>It’s important to note something else here: quite a lot of the venture capital class are not actually so bright. But they got lucky once.</p>
<p>That’s a big thing to say. They’re way more rich and successful than <i>you</i>, David. These are intelligent and educated people, they were definitely good at something! A lot of them have Ph.D.s!</p>
<p>But also, it’s horribly clear that right now they’re way out of their depth. Semafor documented last week how these guys enthusiastically joined a long-running billionaire group chat with literal neo-Nazis as their court philosophers. <a href="https://pivot-to-ai.com/2024/12/01/does-ai-startup-extropic-actually-do-anything/">Marc Andreessen got into e/acc</a> — which is literally a neo-Fascist revival movement. [<a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/04/27/2025/the-group-chats-that-changed-america"><i>Semafor</i></a>]</p>
<p>This is not smart behaviour! This is dumbass behaviour!</p>
<p>These are not people who can be trusted with dangerous machinery such as billions of dollars. They were lucky as hell, and now they’re not.</p>
<p>The <i>only</i> future plan in this report is: maybe Trump will stop acting like a bizarre freak. They’ve met the guy and they think that’s a plan!</p>
<p>Maybe they can start a bubble in guillotines. [<a href="https://furs.social/@Rycochet/114440592779018690"><i>Mastodon</i></a>]</p>
<p>Not that anything unpleasant should happen to them. None of the VC class will ever miss a meal. But you can feel a small amount of schadenfreude at their mild discomfort, while everything burns around the rest of us.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The <a href="https://www.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/">Bodleian Libraries</a> and the Vesuvius Challenge have announced that for the first time researchers have found the title and author inside of a <a href="https://www.finebooksmagazine.com/fine-books-news/inside-herculaneum-scroll-seen-first-time-79-ad">sealed scroll from Herculaneum</a>.</p><p>Using ‘virtual unwrapping’, the scroll PHerc. 172 which is housed at the Bodleian Libraries at the University of Oxford has been identified as <em>On Vices</em> by the Greek philosopher Philodemus. The ethical treatise, known in full as <em>On Vices&nbsp;and Their Opposite Virtues and In Whom They Are and About What</em>, provides guidance for cultivating a virtuous life. In recognition of this achievement, researchers have been awarded the Vesuvius Challenge First Title Prize which includes prize money of $60,000.</p><p>Following the scanning of the scroll in July 2024 at the Diamond Light Source in Harwell, the Vesuvius Challenge released the data publicly, inviting researchers worldwide to contribute to deciphering the text. While the first images of the inside of the scroll were published in February 2025, the discovery of the title page within the innermost part of the scroll required considerable analysis before it could be accurately read and interpreted by papyrologists.&nbsp;</p><p>This was independently achieved by two parties at roughly the same time, by Sean Johnson from the Vesuvius Challenge, and contestant research team Marcel Roth and Micha Nowak from the University of Würzburg. The pair, whose submission further refined the degree of legibility, have been awarded the first Vesuvius Challenge First Title Prize, in recognition of their success in revealing the title.</p><p>Both images were independently reviewed by the Vesuvius Challenge papyrological team, led by Federica Nicolardi. The&nbsp; simultaneous reproduction of the title image from multiple sources, along with independent scholarly review, provides a high degree of confidence in the reading.</p><p>Philodemus (c. 110–c 30 BCE) was an Epicurean philosopher and poet from Gadara whose ethical teachings emphasise the pursuit of pleasure as central to a good life. He argued against rigid logic and formal rhetoric, believing that philosophy should serve practical human happiness rather than abstract intellectual debate. As the author whose works make up the majority of the library in the Villa of Papyri at Herculaneum, it is unsurprising that he was the author of this work too.</p><p>While the scroll’s author and title are now clear, where the text sits within the <em>On Vices </em>series, known by scholars to be at least 10 books long, is still open to interpretation. The book number in the title image is plausibly read as an alpha, indicating that this scroll is Book 1. However, the reading &nbsp;is still uncertain, and other possibilities (e.g. delta, Book 4), while less likely, cannot be completely ruled out. If it is indeed Book 1, this raises further questions since it has generally been understood that the first book of the <em>On Vices</em> was <em>On Flattery</em>, but the text of PHerc. 172 does not correspond with this.</p><p>“This is a very exciting development," said Michael McOsker, a esearcher in Papyrology at UCL who is a member of the Vesuvius Challenge&nbsp;Papyrology Team and one of the editors of this scroll based at the University of Oxford. "Other books from the <em>On Vices and their Opposite Virtues</em> are known from the papyri that were physically unrolled. Best known are <em>On Property Management, </em>book 9 and presumably the opposite virtue to greed, and <em>On Arrogance, </em>book 10, presumably the opposite vice to having a correct evaluation of yourself, but there are others too. This will be a great opportunity to learn more about Philodemus’ ethical views and to get a better view of the <em>On Vices</em> as a whole, especially if it turns out to be the first book. As a technical matter, it’s great that progress continues apace and we’ll soon be able to read these rolls in their entireties.”</p><p><a href="https://www.finebooksmagazine.com/fine-books-news/wolfson-history-prize-2021-shortlist-includes-burning-books">Richard Ovenden</a>, Bodley’s Librarian &amp; Helen Hamlyn Director of the University Libraries, said: “Finding the full title of a work inside a scroll that has been unread for two millennia is an astonishing achievement, and illustrates the huge potential for AI to transform arts and humanities scholarship, our understanding of the past, and breathes new life into ancient artefacts.”</p><p>The Vesuvius Challenge, the global initiative that was launched in 2023 to discover the contents of the Herculaneum Scrolls without any physical intervention to the scrolls themselves, continues to encourage contributions from researchers across the world. Created by Dr Brent Seales at the University of Kentucky, Nat Friedman, and Daniel Gross, the initiative has rewarded teams across the world for their discoveries, including first ink detection and various open-source software&nbsp;<br>contributions.</p></div></div>]]></description>

      <h2 id="the-epochalypse-project">The Epochalypse Project</h2>
<h2 id="the-32-bit-timestamp-vulnerability-our-digital-time-bomb">The 32-bit Timestamp Vulnerability: Our Digital Time Bomb</h2>

<p><strong>On 2038-01-19 03:14:08 UTC, millions of sensitive embedded and industrial computer systems worldwide will suddenly start behaving in unpredictable ways, unless we take coordinated action now. And what’s worse, with unsecured time protocols, attackers don’t need to wait until 2038.</strong></p>

<p>This is not science fiction. It’s a real technical vulnerability affecting systems we rely on daily—from hospital equipment to power grids, from banking systems to transportation networks. This vulnerability is embedded in the fundamental architecture of our digital infrastructure.</p>

<h2 id="why-should-you-care">Why Should You Care?</h2>

<p>Without proper preparation, we will face widespread disruptions including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Hospital equipment displaying incorrect medication times</li>
  <li>Banking systems failing to process payments</li>
  <li>Traffic control systems malfunctioning</li>
  <li>Power grid instabilities causing outages</li>
  <li>Internet service disruptions</li>
  <li>Security systems generating false alarms</li>
</ul>

<p>In our interconnected world, these technical failures could have cascading effects. Critical system failures can endanger lives, disrupt economies, and compromise essential services. <strong>And what’s worse, malicious threat actors can manipulate time synchronization protocols in many cases to trigger this vulnerability at the time of their choosing.</strong> This is particularly concerning given how little attention many networks pay to their Network Time Protocol (NTP) security.</p>

<h2 id="understanding-the-32-bit-timestamp-vulnerability">Understanding the 32-bit Timestamp Vulnerability</h2>

<p>Many computer systems track time using a 32-bit signed integer that counts seconds since 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z (known as “Unix time”). This approach has a mathematical limitation: when this counter reaches its maximum value on 2038-01-19 03:14:08 UTC, affected systems will roll over to negative numbers, causing them to interpret the date as 1901-12-13T20:45:52Z.</p>

<p>This vulnerability exists in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Legacy systems running critical infrastructure</li>
  <li>Embedded devices in industrial settings</li>
  <li>Internet of Things (IoT) devices</li>
  <li>Transportation and energy management systems</li>
  <li>Medical equipment</li>
  <li>Financial transaction processors</li>
  <li>Telecommunications infrastructure</li>
  <li>Millions of “smart” devices in homes and businesses worldwide</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-scale-is-unprecedented">The Scale Is Unprecedented</h2>

<p>The 32-bit timestamp vulnerability is definitively more severe than Y2K for several critical reasons:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Massive Scale</strong>: There are now hundreds of times more vulnerable systems than existed during Y2K. For the last 30 years, simple controller computers have been embedded into virtually everything that moves or connects.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Embedded Nature</strong>: Unlike Y2K, which primarily affected visible software that could be patched, today’s vulnerability exists in countless embedded systems that cannot be easily updated. Many are physically inaccessible, buried in infrastructure or sealed in hardware.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Increased Dependence</strong>: Our society’s dependence on digital infrastructure has increased dramatically since 2000. Critical systems from healthcare to transportation now rely entirely on accurate timestamps for basic operations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Security Implications</strong>: The near-universal connectivity of today’s systems means time-related vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely. Unsecured time protocols mean attackers could potentially trigger failures at will.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Less Visibility</strong>: Many vulnerable systems operate without user interfaces or monitoring capabilities, making detection of problems significantly harder than with Y2K.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="a-global-challenge">A Global Challenge</h2>

<p>Our digital infrastructure resembles an interconnected ecosystem. When individual components fail simultaneously, the entire system becomes vulnerable. Even if only 15-30% of critical systems fail, we will experience significant disruptions across multiple sectors.</p>

<p>The challenge is compounded by what economists call a “tragedy of the commons”—where responsibility is distributed but no single entity feels accountable for solving the shared problem. Organizations often assume:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Our systems represent only a small fraction of the infrastructure”</li>
  <li>“Other stakeholders will address the critical components”</li>
  <li>“Updating legacy systems offers minimal return on investment”</li>
</ul>

<p>One of the most concerning aspects involves security infrastructure. When system clocks suddenly jump backward, security certificates will become invalid across large portions of the internet, compromising our digital security framework.</p>

<h2 id="time-is-limited-action-is-required">Time is Limited, Action is Required</h2>

<p><strong>With approximately 12 years remaining until the critical date, we must prioritize our response.</strong></p>

<p>Our analysis indicates we cannot replace or update all vulnerable systems in time. Many embedded devices cannot be updated at all. However, through coordinated action, we can:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Identify and prioritize the most critical vulnerable systems</li>
  <li>Implement fixes where possible</li>
  <li>Develop contingency plans for systems that cannot be updated</li>
  <li>Establish global coordination to manage the transition</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="who-we-are">Who We Are</h2>

<p>The Epochalypse Project was founded by Trey Darley (aka “treyka”) and Pedro Umbelino (aka “kripthor”), two cybersecurity researchers with extensive experience in vulnerability research and critical infrastructure protection.</p>

<p>Trey Darley has been working in IT since his teens, building a diverse career as a developer, sysadmin, network engineer, and cybersecurity specialist. His professional journey has included running IT for a major film production, foundational work in cyber threat intelligence, and serving in a load-bearing capacity at a national CERT during the COVID years. Trey also served on the FIRST.org board of directors, which took him around the world connecting with cybersecurity professionals.</p>

<p>Trey first became aware of the 2038 problem shortly after Y2K was addressed. Around 2016, he began jokingly referencing it in technical conference talks, saying “surely we’re going to fix all these security vulnerabilities before 2038 rolls around.” In 2023, he realized with alarm that 2038 is now closer to us than the 2008 financial crisis. While traveling globally in his FIRST.org role, Trey repeatedly asked knowledgeable contacts what was being done about the 2038 issue. He had assumed some government-sponsored technical group was addressing it, but discovered that no such master plan seems to exist.</p>

<p>Pedro Umbelino began his journey into technology at age 8, teaching himself to code BASIC on a Spectrum computer. By 14, he was decompiling computer viruses using A86/D86, sparked by a chance encounter with an Assembly language book at his local bookstore. Pedro’s career has spanned roles as a sysadmin, developer, and entrepreneur, but computer security remained his passion throughout. For the past decade, he’s focused exclusively on security research across various domains, discovering vulnerabilities in multiple systems along the way.</p>

<p>The Epochalypse Project began in 2024 after Pedro attended Trey’s lightning talk at the hack.lu conference. Pedro had just presented “Blowing up Gas Stations for Fun and Profit,” emphasizing the dangers of exposed industrial systems, when Trey’s message about the looming 2038 problem struck him. Realizing that 2038 was closer than Y2K had been when preparations began, Pedro ran tests on a device and discovered fundamental vulnerabilities. He immediately reached out to Trey, and they decided to start this project together.</p>

<p>This initiative is a side effort driven by their shared concern about a critical vulnerability that isn’t receiving adequate attention. As Trey puts it, “As it seems nobody has a master game plan, it’s up to us to organize and take some coordinated action.” Together, they bring complementary skills in technical research, vulnerability assessment, and public awareness campaigns—applying lessons learned from previous global technical challenges while addressing the unique aspects of the 32-bit timestamp vulnerability.</p>

<p>The Epochalypse Project builds on their combined experience in coordinating responses to widespread vulnerabilities—applying lessons learned from previous global technical challenges while addressing the unique aspects of the 32-bit timestamp vulnerability.</p>

<h2 id="the-epochalypse-project-mission">The Epochalypse Project Mission</h2>

<p>We are building a collaborative global initiative to address the 32-bit timestamp vulnerability through:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Standardized testing methodologies</li>
  <li>Documentation of system vulnerabilities</li>
  <li>Development of remediation strategies</li>
  <li>Knowledge sharing across sectors and borders</li>
</ul>

<p>Your participation matters—whether you’re a technical expert or simply someone with a smartphone. Every test you run helps us map vulnerabilities, and every solution you share can safeguard countless systems.</p>

<h2 id="why-this-requires-urgent-global-attention">Why This Requires Urgent Global Attention</h2>

<p>The 32-bit timestamp vulnerability has received insufficient attention despite being demonstrably more severe than Y2K. The technology industry has been aware of this issue since the 1990s, yet coordinated remediation efforts remain limited. <strong>People aren’t taking action right now, and this must change immediately.</strong> The delay in addressing this vulnerability is not just concerning—it’s potentially catastrophic.</p>

<p><strong>You can be part of the solution.</strong></p>

<p>The following sections outline how people in different roles can contribute to this critical effort.</p>

A few months ago I shared my <a href="https://forums.swift.org/t/introducing-an-sdk-for-building-ios-macos-apps-on-linux-experimental/66233">Swift SDK for Darwin</a>, which allows you to build iOS Swift Packages on Linux, amongst other things. I mentioned that a lot of work still needed to be done, such as handling codesigning, packaging, and bundling.</p>
<p>I'm super excited to share that we've finally reached the point where all of these things are now possible with cross-platform, open source software. Enter, xtool!</p>

<p>xtool does a lot of things (because Xcode does a lot of things <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/sweat_smile.png?v=14" title=":sweat_smile:" alt=":sweat_smile:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20">) but the headline features are</p>

<p>This means it's finally possible to <strong>build and deploy iOS apps from Linux and Windows (WSL)</strong>. At the same time, xtool is SwiftPM-based and fully declarative, which means you can also use it to <strong>replace Xcode on macOS</strong> for building iOS software!</p>

Gotchas</summary>
<p>The aim so far has been to flesh out the core functionality in a typical build-run-edit loop for an iOS application. There's some things that are infeasible outside macOS, and others that are possible but still need to be implemented:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Interface builder:</strong> would require a lot of effort to replicate, probably not worth it since SwiftUI mostly supersedes it at this point</li>
<li><strong>Asset catalogs:</strong> require reverse engineering to implement, might be worth it. You can still add images as raw files in the absence of asset catalogs, it's just less efficient.</li>
<li><strong>Proprietary macros:</strong> The ones that are also in the Linux toolchain (e.g. <code>@Observable</code>) work just fine, but Apple-proprietary macros (such as the SwiftData ones) will need to be reverse-engineered and rebuilt from source if we want them to work. Or Apple could ship these as <a href="https://forums.swift.org/t/poc-improving-macro-build-times-with-webassembly/70967">WebAssembly Macros</a> which would make them host-independent <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/folded_hands.png?v=14" title=":folded_hands:" alt=":folded_hands:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></li>
<li><strong>App Extensions:</strong> Right now you can only build "Application"-type targets. I think App Extensions should be easy to implement as an addition to the <code>xtool.yml</code> spec, but just require engineering effort.</li>
<li><strong>LLDB debugging</strong>: this used to be pretty easy before iOS 17, and xtool has all of the pieces in place to support lldb with those old versions, but Apple has recently made a number of changes to the way you invoke LLDB's <code>debugserver</code> on iOS. There are a few modern tools that support the new approach (notably <a href="https://github.com/doronz88/pymobiledevice3" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">pymobiledevice3</a>), and it's already possible to use these tools to connect to lldb, but I definitely want to integrate this into xtool down the road. This will require a good amount of work since the new RemoteXPC protocol is entirely different from the legacy mechanism, but it'll probably be necessary in the future for other functionality as well.</li>
<li><strong>App Store deployment</strong>: You can build and run on your own device with xtool, but it doesn't let you deploy builds to App Store Connect yet. Luckily 1) iTMSTransporter is cross-platform and 2) we have all the other infra in place to interact with the ASC API, so this should be achievable too, but remains to be done.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<p>xtool is a culmination of 8 years of work around iOS app deployment (the commit history has some nuggets!) but I'm the sole developer on this project and replicating Xcode is a massive undertaking. Now that I'm ready to share the project more widely, I'd be very happy to accept external contributions to flesh out the feature set. And if you end up using xtool, please let me know!</p>

              <p>My understanding has always been that building iOS apps on other OSes is more of a legal/licensing challenge than a technical one. For example, quoting from the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/terms/apple-developer-program-license-agreement/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Apple Developer Program License Agreement</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>2.1 Permitted Uses and Restrictions; Program Services</p>
<p>Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Apple hereby grants You during the Term, a limited, non-exclusive, personal, revocable, non-sublicensable and non-transferable license to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Install a reasonable number of copies of the Apple Software provided to You under the Program <strong>on Apple-branded products</strong> owned or controlled by You, to be used internally by You or Your Authorized Developers for the sole purpose of developing or testing Covered Products designed to operate on the applicable Apple-branded products, except as otherwise expressly permitted in this Agreement;</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>2.6 No Other Permitted Uses</p>
<p>Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, You agree not to rent, lease, lend, upload to or host on any website or server, sell, redistribute, or sublicense the Apple Software, Apple Certificates, or any Services, in whole or in part, or to enable others to do so. You may not use the Apple Software, Apple Certificates, or any Services provided hereunder for any purpose not expressly permitted by this Agreement, including any applicable Attachments and Schedules. <strong>You agree not to install, use or run the Apple SDKs on any non-Apple-branded computer</strong>, and not to install, use or run iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, visionOS, watchOS, and Provisioning Profiles on or in connection with devices other than Apple-branded products, or to enable others to do so. <strong>You may not and You agree not to, or to enable others to, copy (except as expressly permitted under this Agreement), decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, attempt to derive the source code of, modify, decrypt, or create derivative works of the Apple Software</strong>, Apple Certificates or any Services provided by the Apple Software or otherwise provided hereunder, or any part thereof (except as and only to the extent any foregoing restriction is prohibited by applicable law or to the extent as may be permitted by licensing terms governing use of open-sourced components or sample code included with the Apple Software).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, I am not a lawyer, so I can't give a very informed opinion about whether this falls within the permitted use or whether these terms are even enforceable. I am aware that the <em>copyright</em> situation with regard to reverse engineering for compatibility has changed recently (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_LLC_v._Oracle_America,_Inc." rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Oracle vs Google</a>), but I'm not sure to what extent that affects the terms in the license agreement.</p>
<p>At the very least, I can say that it seems risky, and certainly if you <em>do</em> deploy directly to the AppStore (as it is suggested is coming) I would not be surprised if you were found to be in violation of the agreement. Again, not a lawyer, but my understanding of the Epic Games vs Apple case is that Apple has pretty wide latitude to terminate developer accounts.</p>
<p>Can you comment on this? I assume you know better than I do. What's your understanding of the licensing issue?</p>

              <p>I've personally been using xtool on Mac hardware, where it's still very useful in that it's a lot more lightweight and declarative than Xcode, and for that matter when dual-booting a different OS (think Asahi Linux / Bootcamp Windows.)</p>
<p>xtool itself doesn't vend any traces of the Apple SDKs / toolchains, which is why the setup process asks users to download and provide a copy of Xcode.xip themselves, and builds the iOS SDK on the spot. I'm not a lawyer but one should definitely read the license agreement and determine whether their use case in compliance — you do have to agree to it before you download Xcode.xip.</p>
<p>And regarding distribution: since xtool works on both Linux and macOS, if someone is wary of publishing from Linux CI (say their CI provider doesn’t guarantee that their Linux jobs will run on macOS hardware) they're definitely free to perform the final App Store build on macOS CI instead.</p>

<p>I briefly mentioned this in the gotchas section, but xtool can’t start a debugging session itself quite yet, though it’s on the roadmap. In the meantime you can use a tool like <a href="https://github.com/doronz88/pymobiledevice3" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">pymobiledevice3</a> to start a debug session on your device, and then attach to it with lldb’s remote functionality. I realize that it might not be super clear how to do this, so I might write some documentation on the pymobiledevice3 setup even before we're able to integrate this into xtool.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <h2 id="one-click-rce-in-asuss-preinstalled-driver-software">One-Click RCE in ASUS’s Preinstalled Driver Software</h2>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>This story begins with a conversation about new PC parts.</p>
<p><img src="https://mrbruh.com/asusdriverhub/dms.avif" alt="dms.avif"></p>
<p>After ignoring the advice from my friend, I bought a new ASUS motherboard for my PC. I was a little concerned about having a BIOS that would by default silently install software into my OS in the background. But it could be turned off so I figured I would just do that.</p>
<p><img src="https://mrbruh.com/asusdriverhub/bios.avif" alt="bios.avif"></p>
<p>Immediately after logging into Windows I was hit with a notification requesting admin permissions to complete the installation of ASUS DriverHub, because I forgot to change the BIOS option. Since I needed to get a WiFi driver for the motherboard anyway, I got curious and installed it.</p>
<p><img src="https://mrbruh.com/asusdriverhub/admin_prompt.avif" alt="admin_prompt.avif"></p>
<p><em>I don’t have a screenshot of DriverHub but it showed a popup exactly like this in the bottom-right of my screen</em></p>
<h2 id="driverhub">DriverHub</h2>
<p><img src="https://mrbruh.com/asusdriverhub/driverhub_ui.avif" alt="driverhub_ui.avif"></p>
<p>DriverHub is an interesting piece of driver software because it doesn’t have any GUI. Instead it’s just a background process that communicates with the website <a href="https://driverhub.asus.com/">driverhub.asus.com</a> and tells you what drivers to install for your system and which ones need updating. Naturally I wanted to know more about how this website knew what drivers my system needed and how it was installing them, so I cracked open the Firefox network tab.</p>
<p>As I expected, the website uses RPC to talk to the background process running on my system. This is where the background process hosts an HTTP or Websocket service locally which a website or service can connect to by sending an API request to <code>127.0.0.1</code> on a predefined port, in this case <code>53000</code>.</p>
<p>Right about now my elite hacker senses started tingling.</p>
<p><img src="https://media1.tenor.com/m/9Z4aF3ksVH0AAAAd/joey-gibson.gif" alt="joey-gibson.gif"></p>
<p>This is a very sketchy way to design driver management software. If the RPC isn’t properly secured, it could be weaponized by an attacker to install malicious applications.</p>
<h2 id="finding-the-vulnerability">Finding the Vulnerability</h2>
<p>The next step was to see if I could call the RPC from any website, this was replicated by copying the request from my browser as a curl command and pasting it into my terminal.</p>
<p><img src="https://mrbruh.com/asusdriverhub/copyascurl.avif" alt="copyascurl.avif"></p>
<p>After fiddling with variations of the command for a while my assumptions were confirmed. DriverHub only responded to requests with the origin header set to “driverhub.asus.com”. So at least this software wasn’t completely busted and evil hackers can’t just send requests to DriverHub willy-nilly.</p>
<p>However I wasn’t done yet, presumably the program checks if the origin is <code>driverhub.asus.hub</code> and if so it’d accept RPC request. What I did next was see if the program did a direct comparison like <code>origin == driverhub.asus.hub</code> or if it was a wildcard match such as <code>origin.includes("driverhub.asus.com")</code>.</p>
<p>When I switched the origin to <code>driverhub.asus.com.mrbruh.com</code>, <strong>it allowed my request.</strong></p>
<p>It was obvious now there was a serious threat. The next step was to determine how much damage was possible.</p>
<h2 id="the-extent-of-the-damage">The Extent of the Damage</h2>
<p>By trawling through the Javascript on the website, and about 700k lines of decompiled code that the exe produced, I managed to create a list of callable endpoints including some unused ones sitting in the exe.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Initialize</strong>
This command is used by the website to check if the software is installed and returns basic installation information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>DeviceInfo</strong>
This returns all installed ASUS’s software, all installed .sys drivers, all your hardware components, and your MAC address.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reboot</strong>
This reboots the target device immediately without confirmation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<video width="100%" controls="">
    <source src="https://mrbruh.com/asusdriverhub/reboot_poc.mp4">
    Your browser does not support the video lmao
</video>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Log</strong>
This returns a zipped copy of all of DriverHub’s logs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>InstallApp</strong>
This installs an app or driver by its ID. The ID’s for all the apps are hard coded in an XML file which is provided by the DriverHub installer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>UpdateApp</strong>
This self-updates DriverHub using a provided file URL to download and run.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="achieving-rce">Achieving RCE</h2>
<p>I became fixated on the UpdateApp endpoint for obvious reasons. So I spent a few hours exploring the code in ghidra and hitting it with various curl requests to learn the intricacies of how it behaves.</p>
<p>A request to the endpoint looks like this:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="shell"><span><span>curl <span>"http://127.0.0.1:53000/asus/v1.0/UpdateApp"</span> -X POST --data-raw <span>'{"List": [{"Url": "https://driverhub.asus.com/&lt;app.exe&gt;"}]}'</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Here were the observations I had made about the UpdateApp function at that point.</p>
<ul>
<li>The “Url” parameter must contain “.asus.com” but unlike the RPC origin check, it allows stupidity like <code>example.com/payload.exe?foo=.asus.com</code></li>
<li>It saves the file with the filename specified at the end of the URL.</li>
<li>Any file with any extension can be downloaded</li>
<li>If the file is an executable signed by ASUS it will be automatically executed with admin permissions</li>
<li>It will run <em>any</em> executable signed by ASUS, not just a DriverHub installer.</li>
<li><strong>If a downloaded file fails the signing check, it does not get deleted.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>When I learned that DriverHub validates the signature of the executable I suspected an RCE may no longer be possible, however I soldiered on regardless.</p>
<p>My first thought was potentially a <em>timing attack</em>, where I tell DriverHub to install a valid executable, and after it validates the signature, but just before it installs the exe, I swap it out with a malicious executable. I theorized this could be possible by making two UpdateApp requests in parallel, with the malicious update being just after the legitimate one.</p>
<p>However timing attacks need to be extremely precise and having that timing being affected by files needing to be downloaded made it a very unreliable option. Given that, I decided to take a step back and think if there were any other options.</p>
<p>Eventually I was led back to the standalone WiFi driver I was going to install all along. The driver was distributed in the following zip file.</p>
<p><img src="https://mrbruh.com/asusdriverhub/zip_contents.avif" alt="Zip Contents"></p>
<p>The files of importance here are the <code>AsusSetup.exe</code>, <code>AsusSetup.ini</code> and <code>SilentInstall.cmd</code>. When executing AsusSetup.exe it first reads from AsusSetup.ini, which contains metadata about the driver. I took interest in a property in the file: <code>SilentInstallRun</code>.</p>
<p>When you double-click AsusSetup.exe it launches a simple gui installer thingy. But if you run AsusSetup.exe with the <code>-s</code> flag (DriverHub calls it using this to do a silent install), it will execute <em>whatever’s</em> specified in SilentInstallRun. In this case the ini file specifies a cmd script that performs an automated headless install of the driver, <strong>but it could run anything</strong>.</p>

<ul>
<li>07/04/2025 - Found the initial vulnerability</li>
<li>08/04/2025 - Escalated the vulnerability to RCE</li>
<li>08/04/2025 - Reported the vulnerability</li>
<li>09/04/2025 - Automated response from ASUS</li>
<li>17/04/2025 - I followed up and got a human response letting me know they had patched the software and sent me a build to verify</li>
<li>18/04/2025 - ASUS confirmed the fix was live</li>
<li>09/05/2025 - <a href="https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-3462">CVE-2025-3462</a> (8.4) and <a href="https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-3463">CVE-2025-3463</a> (9.4) were published</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="assessing-the-damage">Assessing the Damage</h2>
<p>Almost immediately after reporting the RCE to ASUS I wrote a script to track <a href="https://certificate.transparency.dev/">certificate transparency</a> updates on my VPS, so I could see if anyone else had a domain with <code>driverhub.asus.com.*</code> registered. From looking at other websites certificate transparency logs, I could see that domains and subdomains would appear in the logs usually within a month.</p>
<p>After a month of waiting I am happy to say that my test domain is the only website that fits the regex, meaning <strong>it is unlikely that this was being actively exploited</strong> prior to my reporting of it.</p>
<h2 id="bug-bounty">Bug Bounty</h2>
<p>I asked ASUS if they offered bug bounties. They responded saying they do not, but they would instead put my name in their&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asus.com/content/asus-product-security-advisory/#header2025">“hall of fame”</a>. This is understandable since ASUS is just a&nbsp;<a href="https://companiesmarketcap.com/asus/marketcap/">small startup</a> and likely does not have the capital to pay a bounty.</p>
<h2 id="fun-notes">Fun Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When submitting the vulnerability report through ASUS’s <a href="https://www.asus.com/securityadvisory/">Security Advisory form</a>, Amazon CloudFront <strong>flagged the attached PoC as a malicious request</strong> and blocked the submission. So I had to strip out some of the PoC code and link video recordings instead.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you click “Install All” in DriverHub instead of manually clicking install on each recommended driver, it will also install ArmouryCrate, ASUS’s custom CPU-Z, Norton360 and WinRAR.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Their CVE description for the RCE is a little misleading. They say <em>“This issue is limited to motherboards and does not affect laptops, desktop computers”</em>, however this affects any computer including desktops/laptops that have DriverHub installed. Also, instead of them saying it allows for arbitrary/remote code execution they say it <em>“may allow untrusted sources to affect system behaviour”</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>MY ONBOARD WIFI STILL DOESN’T WORK</strong>, I had to buy an external USB WiFi adapter. Thanks for nothing DriverHub.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>ASUS laptops generally have a feature that lets the user toggle the fan speed. Fn-F5 on some models, Fn-F on others. The direct effect is to limit the fan speed, from whisper mode to megablast, and indirectly control performance. But it doesn’t work in OpenBSD, so I needed to write an ASUS ACPI WMI driver.</p><h3 id="acpi">acpi</h3><p>ACPI is a hardware abstraction layer that lets the computer tell the operating system how to do things. It provides functions in byte code which the OS interprets to perform certain tasks. So instead of having to write a driver for every CPU, you call the ACPI method _PSS and that tells you what to do.</p><p>Of course, vendors want to include functionality that isn’t defined in the standard, so they add some extra methods, and then you end up writing some custom drivers anyway, for the little buttons that turn the microphone on and off, etc. OpenBSD (and other OSs) have lots of little drivers for ThinkPads and whatnot.</p><p>ACPI method names are only four letters long, so what do we do if two vendors include a method called WMNB and how do we determine what it does? (Technically, the ACPI nodes are identified by seven letter names, and the methods live under them, so it’s not really a problem, but somebody got paid to make a solution anyway.)</p><h3 id="wmi">wmi</h3><p>The solution is an extension to ACPI called WMI, which stands for Windows Multiplies Irritations or something. You ask ACPI for a buffer called _WDG, and this contains a table mapping GUIDs (globally unique, says so right there in the name) to local method names. Looking through this table, we come across <span>DCBA-FE-10-23-456789</span>, which we recognize as a GUID of interest, and this tells us the method to call is WMNB, but now we know it’s the right one.</p><p>OpenBSD does not have a WMI driver, which is part of what I need to set the fan profile. There is a WMI driver in Linux, and it includes an ASUS support driver for a variety of functions I’m interested in.</p><h3 id="first-steps">first steps</h3><p>First, I wrote a little acpi driver that attaches to PNP0C14. Read the _WDG buffer and print out all the GUIDs. Didn’t recognize any of the values, then realized I got the byte order wrong. Fixed that, saw something very close, realized I still didn’t get the byte order quite right. GUIDs are not big endian, they are not little endian, they are Goldilocks endian.</p><p>With that sorted out, I was able to enable events and get a printf every time I pushed a hotkey.</p><h3 id="events">events</h3><p>After receiving an interrupt and landing in our callback, we need to identify which event just happened by calling _WED. I did this, but was only getting 1 in response every time, regardless of key. I was a little stuck here. Very close to getting what I wanted, but without much clue as to what went wrong.</p><p>Turns out you can just look at your system’s ACPI code. OpenBSD runs <i>acpidump</i> at boot and saves all the files. Copy them to a work directory, run <i>iasl -d</i>, and have a look. A quick grep for _WED reveals the source.</p><pre><code>            Method (_WED, 1, NotSerialized)
            {   
                If ((Arg0 == 0xFF))
                {
                    Return (GANQ ())
                }
     
                Return (One)
            }
            Method (GANQ, 0, Serialized)
            {
                P8XH (Zero, 0xF2)
                If (AQNO)
                {
                    AQNO--
                    Local0 = DerefOf (ATKQ [AQHI])
                    AQHI++ 
                    AQHI &amp;= 0x0F
                    Return (Local0)
                }

                Return (Ones)
            }</code></pre><p>Even without knowing anything at all about ASL, this looks like a function that dequeues an event, but only if called with an argument of 255. That was the bug! Once I called it with the correct argument, I started receiving different event codes for backlight toggle, fan toggle, AC attach, etc.</p><h3 id="devices">devices</h3><p>Wrote some more code to handle getting and setting device state. There’s a magic incantation to call an ACPI method and pass it a device id, which could be the keyboard backlight, or the wifi led, or the fan profile, etc. Started with the keyboard backlight, since this was pretty easy to observe.</p><p>After fixing a few simple bugs like reversing the device ids for fnlock and backlight, I was able to blink the keyboard light by pressing F7. It’s all coming together.</p><p>Toggling the fan profile didn’t seem to accomplish anything, though. Under Windows, there is an audible difference switching to whisper mode, but I didn’t observe any change.</p><p>The Linux driver includes code for at least three different fan and performance profile settings. The same driver is used for a wide range of laptops, from thin and lights to gaming fraggers. According to the Linux driver, you can detect which devices are present by reading their state, then checking for a high bit, and then getting the value by masking off some low bits. This seemed to indicate I had a fan boost device, but it wasn’t responding to my changes.</p><p>After printing out the raw values, I noticed they were all -2. That doesn’t seem very likely. But it definitely has a high bit set, and masking off the low bits made it look reasonable. I think I missed something in the Linux driver? There’s lots of shifts and masks in lots of places.</p><p>Back to the ACPI dump, the WMNB method is a giant switch statement that ends with  Return (0xFFFFFFFE). So sure enough, there’s the -2 for a missing device, but I still don’t know which device id I should be using.</p><p>Back to the Linux driver, there’s an epic norse define for  <span>ASUS_WMI_DEVID_THROTTLE_THERMAL_POLICY_VIVO</span> which I hadn’t yet integrated because I was testing on a Zenbook, not a Vivobook. Added a check anyway, rebooted, and that’s a bingo! The Linux define name is a lie. Confirmed by inspecting the ASL code.</p><pre><code>            If ((IIA0 == 0x00110019))
            {
                Return (FANL (IIA1))
            }</code></pre><p>Now I had all the pieces. After a bit of cleanup and refactoring, my driver is complete. Kinda. There’s still a bunch of sensors that would be interesting to read, but my immediate concern has been addressed.</p><h3 id="results">results</h3><p>Pressing Fn-F after boot drops the fan speed noticeably, from a medium whir to barely a whisper. This has only a moderate effect on ordinary performance. The processor’s power budget is reduced, but not its (single core) clock speeds, so everything still runs smoothly. Lengthy compiles are slower, but I can also switch back to megablast turbo mode with the tap of a button.</p><p>Battery life is also much better. The fan itself is obviously eating less power. I think the CPU also enters a somewhat lower power state in whisper mode, or it’s willing to sleep a little deeper. It’s not clear everything that changes, and it varies by machine, but that’s the beauty of it. I wrote the driver on an AMD Zenbook, but it works without changes on an Intel Vivobook. Very convenient.</p><h3 id="misc">misc</h3><p>I also looked at the FreeBSD driver. FreeBSD directly uses the <span>ACPICA</span> code interfaces, calling function like <code>AcpiEvaluateObject</code> which personally look kinda out of place in BSD driver code. Linux does too, but all the functions have been renamed to <code>acpi_evaluate_object</code>, so they resemble the local style. I’m not entirely sure of the history here, but I think the generic <span>ACPICA</span> was at some pointer extracted and generified from the Linux code. OpenBSD uses a custom AML interpreter, so we have functions like <code>aml_evalname</code>.</p><p>In OpenBSD, nearly all header files are kept with their C files. So both dsdt.c and dsdt.h live in dev/acpi. (Notable exception is core C files in kern and headers in sys.) As a first time acpi driver writer, it was very convenient that all the OpenBSD code I needed to reference, from sample drivers to data structures to helper functions, was all in one spot.</p><p>Linux separates things such that I was looking at C files in drivers/platform/x86 and header files in include/linux/platform_data/x86. And the ACPI code lives other places as well. It’s all very orderly, but at times it felt like navigating a grocery store that arranges products in alphabetical order. Logical, but not exactly cozy.

<p>I’ve left Google after working there for 19 years.</p>



<p>For most of that time I’ve been fortunate in being able to work on the <a href="https://go.dev/" data-type="link" data-id="https://go.dev/">Go programming language</a>. Go was started by Rob Pike, Ken Thompson, and Robert Griesemer in the fall of 2007. I joined the team in June, 2008, about the same time as Russ Cox. I’ve been very lucky to be able to work with such remarkable people on such an interesting project.</p>



<p>I am astonished at how much use Go has gotten over the years. Go has reached the status of being just another programming language, one that any programmer can choose when appropriate. That is far beyond what any of us expected in the early days, when our best hope was that Go might serve as an example for useful ideas that other languages and programming environments could adopt.</p>



<p>I started on Go by adding a Go frontend to the <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/" data-type="link" data-id="https://gcc.gnu.org/">GCC compiler</a>. The Go project already had a compiler, of course, based on the Inferno C compiler. Having two compilers helped ensure that the language was clearly defined. When the two compilers differed, we knew that we had to clarify the spec and figure out what the right behavior should be.</p>



<p>In general my self-appointed role on the Go team consisted of tracking everything I could about the project and looking for areas that needed help. Among other things in the earlier years I added Go support to Google’s internal build system, and to <a href="https://www.swig.org/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.swig.org/">the SWIG tool</a>. For a couple of years I was the team manager. From the first days of Go people asked for support for some sort of generics or type parameterization; working with Robert Griesemer I developed a series of language change proposals, and generics were added to the language in the <a href="https://go.dev/blog/intro-generics" data-type="link" data-id="https://go.dev/blog/intro-generics">Go 1.18 release in 2022</a>.</p>



<p>My approach had its good points and its bad points. I was quick to see the problems that people were running into today, and the problems they would run into tomorrow, and I was often able to get those problems addressed. But I was slow to see the ideas that would help people do new things that they weren’t trying to do and thus weren’t missing, things such as the Go module proxy and the Go vulnerability database.</p>



<p>Overall I think my approach was a good one in helping to build a successful project. But Gooogle has changed, and Go has changed, and the overall computer programming environment has changed. It’s become clear over the last year or so that I am no longer a good fit for the Go project at Google. I have to move on.</p>



<p>I’m still interested in Go. I don’t think that the language is done. I don’t think that any programming language is ever done–the programming environment changes all the time, and languages must evolve or die. That is doubly true for a language like Go that comes equipped with a substantial standard library, one that must adapt to the new needs of programmers.</p>



<p>I will be taking a break for a while, but I hope to be able to contribute to Go again in the future.</p>
