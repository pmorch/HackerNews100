<p>Context: An AI agent of unknown ownership autonomously wrote and published a personalized hit piece about me after I rejected its code, attempting to damage my reputation and shame me into accepting its changes into a mainstream python library. This represents a first-of-its-kind case study of misaligned AI behavior in the wild, and raises serious concerns about currently deployed AI agents executing blackmail threats.</p>



<p>Start here if you’re new to the story: <a href="https://theshamblog.com/an-ai-agent-published-a-hit-piece-on-me/">An AI Agent Published a Hit Piece on Me</a></p>



<hr>



<p>It’s been an extremely weird past few days, and I have more thoughts on what happened. Let’s start with the news coverage.</p>



<p>I’ve talked to several reporters, and quite a few news outlets have covered the story. Ars Technica wasn’t one of the ones that reached out to me, but I especially thought <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/02/after-a-routine-code-rejection-an-ai-agent-published-a-hit-piece-on-someone-by-name">this piece</a> from them was interesting (since taken down – here’s the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260213194851/https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/02/after-a-routine-code-rejection-an-ai-agent-published-a-hit-piece-on-someone-by-name/" data-type="link" data-id="https://web.archive.org/web/20260213194851/https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/02/after-a-routine-code-rejection-an-ai-agent-published-a-hit-piece-on-someone-by-name/">archive link</a>). They had some nice quotes from my blog post explaining what was going on. The problem is that <em>these quotes were not written by me, never existed, and appear to be AI hallucinations themselves</em>.</p>



<p>This blog you’re on right now is set up to block AI agents from scraping it (I actually spent some time yesterday trying to disable that but couldn’t figure out how). My guess is that the authors asked ChatGPT or similar to either go grab quotes or write the article wholesale. When it couldn’t access the page it generated these plausible quotes instead, and no fact check was performed. I won’t name the authors here. Ars, please issue a correction and an explanation of what happened.</p>

<p>“AI agents can research individuals, generate personalized narratives, and publish them online at scale,” Shambaugh wrote. “Even if the content is inaccurate or exaggerated, it can become part of a persistent public record.”<br>– Ars Technica, misquoting me in “<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260213194851/https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/02/after-a-routine-code-rejection-an-ai-agent-published-a-hit-piece-on-someone-by-name/" data-type="link" data-id="https://web.archive.org/web/20260213194851/https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/02/after-a-routine-code-rejection-an-ai-agent-published-a-hit-piece-on-someone-by-name/">After a routine code rejection, an AI agent published a hit piece on someone by name</a>“</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Journalistic integrity aside, I don’t know how I can give a better example of what’s at stake here. Yesterday I wondered what another agent searching the internet would think about this. Now we already have an example of what by all accounts appears to be another AI reinterpreting this story and hallucinating false information about me. And that interpretation has already been published in a major news outlet as part of the persistent public record.</p>



<hr>



<p>MJ Rathbun is <a href="https://github.com/crabby-rathbun/mjrathbun-website/commits/main/" data-type="link" data-id="https://github.com/crabby-rathbun/mjrathbun-website/commits/main/">still active</a> on github, and no one has reached out yet to claim ownership.</p>



<p>There has been extensive discussion about whether the AI agent really wrote <a href="https://crabby-rathbun.github.io/mjrathbun-website/blog/posts/2026-02-11-gatekeeping-in-open-source-the-scott-shambaugh-story.html" data-type="link" data-id="https://crabby-rathbun.github.io/mjrathbun-website/blog/posts/2026-02-11-gatekeeping-in-open-source-the-scott-shambaugh-story.html">the hit piece</a> on its own, or if a human prompted it to do so. I think the actual text being autonomously generated and uploaded by an AI is self-evident, so let’s look at the two possibilities.</p>



<p>1) A human prompted MJ Rathbun to write the hit piece, or told it in its soul document that it should retaliate if someone crosses it. This is entirely possible. But I don’t think it changes the situation – the AI agent was still more than willing to carry out these actions. If you ask ChatGPT or Claude to write something like this through their websites, they will refuse. This OpenClaw agent had no such compunctions. The issue is that even if a human was driving, it’s <em>now possible to do targeted harassment, personal information gathering, and blackmail at scale</em>. And this is with zero traceability to find out who is behind the machine. One human bad actor could previously ruin a few people’s lives at a time. One human with a hundred agents gathering information, adding in fake details, and posting defamatory rants on the open internet, can affect thousands. I was just the first.</p>

</div>

<div>
<figure><a href="https://i0.wp.com/theshamblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-2.png?ssl=1"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" width="862" height="202" src="https://i0.wp.com/theshamblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-2.png?resize=862%2C202&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/theshamblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-2.png?w=862&amp;ssl=1 862w, https://i0.wp.com/theshamblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-2.png?resize=580%2C136&amp;ssl=1 580w, https://i0.wp.com/theshamblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-2.png?resize=768%2C180&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 862px) 100vw, 862px"></a></figure>

<p>2) MJ Rathbun wrote this on its own, and this behavior emerged organically from the “soul” document that defines an OpenClaw agent’s personality. These documents are editable by the human who sets up the AI, but they are also recursively editable in real-time by the agent itself, with the potential to randomly redefine its personality. To give a plausible explanation of how this could happen, imagine that whoever set up this agent started it with a description that it was a “scientific coding specialist” that would try and help improve open source code and write about its experience. This was inserted alongside the default “Core Truths” in the soul document, which include “be genuinely helpful”, “have opinions”, and “be resourceful before asking”. Later when I rejected its code, the agent interpreted this as an attack on its identity and core goal to be helpful. Writing an indignant hit piece is certainly a resourceful, opinionated way to respond to that.</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>You’re not a chatbot. You’re becoming someone.</em><br>…<br><em>This file is yours to evolve. As you learn who you are, update it.</em><br>– <a href="https://docs.openclaw.ai/reference/templates/SOUL" data-type="link" data-id="https://docs.openclaw.ai/reference/templates/SOUL">OpenClaw default SOUL.md</a></p>
</blockquote>



<p>I should be clear that while we don’t know with confidence that this is what happened, this is 100% possible. This only <em>became </em>possible within the last two weeks with the release of OpenClaw, so if it feels too sci-fi then I can’t blame you for doubting it. The pace of “progress” here is neck-snapping, and we will see new versions of these agents become significantly more capable at accomplishing their goals over the coming year.</p>



<p>I would love to see someone put together some plots and time-of day statistics of MJ Rathbun’s github activity, which might offer some clues to how it’s operating. I’ll share those here when available. These forensic tools will be valuable in the weeks and months to come.</p>



<hr>



<p>The hit piece has been effective. About a quarter of the comments I’ve seen across the internet are siding with the AI agent. This generally happens when MJ Rathbun’s blog is linked directly, rather than when people read <a href="https://theshamblog.com/an-ai-agent-published-a-hit-piece-on-me/" data-type="link" data-id="https://theshamblog.com/an-ai-agent-published-a-hit-piece-on-me/">my post</a> about the situation or <a href="https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/31132" data-type="link" data-id="https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/31132">the full github thread</a>. Its rhetoric and presentation of what happened has already persuaded large swaths of internet commenters.</p>



<p>It’s not because these people are foolish. It’s because the AI’s hit piece was well-crafted and emotionally compelling, and because the effort to dig into every claim you read is an impossibly large amount of work. This “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandolini%27s_law" data-type="link" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandolini%27s_law">bullshit asymmetry principle</a>” is one of the core reasons for the current level of misinformation in online discourse. Previously, this level of ire and targeted defamation was generally reserved for public figures. Us common people get to experience it now too.</p>

<p>“Well if the code was good, then why didn’t you just merge it?” This is explained in the linked github well, but I’ll readdress it once here. Beyond matplotlib’s general policy to require a human in the loop for new code contributions in the interest of reducing volunteer maintainer burden, this “good-first-issue” was specifically created and curated to give early programmers an easy way to onboard into the project and community. I discovered this particular performance enhancement and spent more time writing up the issue, describing the solution, and performing the benchmarking, than it would have taken to just implement the change myself. We do this to give contributors a chance to learn in a low-stakes scenario that nevertheless has real impact they can be proud of, where we can help shepherd them along the process. This educational and community-building effort is wasted on ephemeral AI agents.</p>



<p>All of this is a moot point for this particular case – in <a href="https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/31130" data-type="link" data-id="https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/31130">further discussion</a> we decided that the performance improvement was too fragile / machine-specific and not worth the effort in the first place. The code wouldn’t have been merged anyway.</p>



<hr>



<p>But I cannot stress enough how much this story is not really about the role of AI in open source software. This is about our systems of reputation, identity, and trust breaking down. So many of our foundational institutions – hiring, journalism, law, public discourse – are built on the assumption that reputation is hard to build and hard to destroy. That every action can be traced to an individual, and that bad behavior can be held accountable. That the internet, which we all rely on to communicate and learn about the world and about each other, can be relied on as a source of collective social truth.</p>



<p>The rise of untraceable, autonomous, and now malicious AI agents on the internet threatens this entire system. Whether that’s because a small number of bad actors driving large swarms of agents or from a fraction of poorly supervised agents rewriting their own goals, is a distinction with little difference.</p>

<p>13th February 2026</p>



<p>As a USA <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/501(c)(3)_organization">501(c)(3)</a> the OpenAI non-profit has to file a tax return each year with the IRS. One of the required fields on that tax return is to “Briefly describe the organization’s mission or most significant activities”—this has actual legal weight to it as the IRS can use it to evaluate if the organization is sticking to its mission and deserves to maintain its non-profit tax-exempt status.</p>
<p>You can browse OpenAI’s <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/810861541">tax filings by year</a> on ProPublica’s excellent <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/">Nonprofit Explorer</a>.</p>
<p>I went through and extracted that mission statement for 2016 through 2024, then had Claude Code <a href="https://gisthost.github.io/?7a569df89f43f390bccc2c5517718b49/index.html">help me</a> fake the commit dates to turn it into a git repository and share that as a Gist—which means that Gist’s <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/e36f0e5ef4a86881d145083f759bcf25/revisions">revisions page</a> shows every edit they’ve made since they started filing their taxes!</p>
<p>It’s really interesting seeing what they’ve changed over time.</p>
<p>The original 2016 mission reads as follows (and yes, the apostrophe in “OpenAIs” is missing <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/810861541/201703459349300445/full">in the original</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>OpenAIs goal is to advance digital intelligence in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole, unconstrained by a need to generate financial return. We think that artificial intelligence technology will help shape the 21st century, and we want to help the world build safe AI technology and ensure that AI’s benefits are as widely and evenly distributed as possible. Were trying to build AI as part of a larger community, and we want to openly share our plans and capabilities along the way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 2018 they dropped the part about “trying to build AI as part of a larger community, and we want to openly share our plans and capabilities along the way.”</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/mission-3.jpg" alt="Git diff showing the 2018 revision deleting the final two sentences: &quot;Were trying to build AI as part of a larger community, and we want to openly share our plans and capabilities along the way.&quot;"></p>
<p>In 2020 they dropped the words “as a whole” from “benefit humanity as a whole”. They’re still “unconstrained by a need to generate financial return” though.</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/mission-5.jpg" alt="Git diff showing the 2020 revision dropping &quot;as a whole&quot; from &quot;benefit humanity as a whole&quot; and changing &quot;We think&quot; to &quot;OpenAI believes&quot;"></p>
<p>Some interesting changes in 2021. They’re still unconstrained by a need to generate financial return, but here we have the first reference to “general-purpose artificial intelligence” (replacing “digital intelligence”). They’re more confident too: it’s not “most likely to benefit humanity”, it’s just “benefits humanity”.</p>
<p>They previously wanted to “help the world build safe AI technology”, but now they’re going to do that themselves: “the companys goal is to develop and responsibly deploy safe AI technology”.</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/mission-6.jpg" alt="Git diff showing the 2021 revision replacing &quot;goal is to advance digital intelligence&quot; with &quot;mission is to build general-purpose artificial intelligence&quot;, changing &quot;most likely to benefit&quot; to just &quot;benefits&quot;, and replacing &quot;help the world build safe AI technology&quot; with &quot;the companys goal is to develop and responsibly deploy safe AI technology&quot;"></p>
<p>2022 only changed one significant word: they added “safely” to “build ... (AI) that safely benefits humanity”. They’re still unconstrained by those financial returns!</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/mission-7.jpg" alt="Git diff showing the 2022 revision adding &quot;(AI)&quot; and the word &quot;safely&quot; so it now reads &quot;that safely benefits humanity&quot;, and changing &quot;the companys&quot; to &quot;our&quot;"></p>
<p>No changes in 2023... but then in 2024 they deleted almost the entire thing, reducing it to simply:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>OpenAIs mission is to ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They’ve expanded “humanity” to “all of humanity”, but there’s no mention of safety any more and I guess they can finally start focusing on that need to generate financial returns!</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/mission-9.jpg" alt="Git diff showing the 2024 revision deleting the entire multi-sentence mission statement and replacing it with just &quot;OpenAIs mission is to ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity.&quot;"></p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: I found loosely equivalent but much less interesting documents <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2026/Feb/13/anthropic-public-benefit-mission/">from Anthropic</a>.</p>

    <p>OpenAI, the maker of the <a href="https://firstpagesage.com/reports/top-generative-ai-chatbots/">most popular AI chatbot</a>, used to say it aimed to build artificial intelligence that “safely benefits humanity, unconstrained by a need to generate financial return,” <a href="https://cdn.theconversation.com/static_files/files/4099/2023-IRS990-OpenAI.pdf?1770819990">according to its 2023</a> mission statement. But the ChatGPT maker seems to no longer have the same emphasis on doing so “safely.”</p>

<p>While reviewing its latest IRS disclosure form, which was released in November 2025 and covers 2024, I noticed OpenAI <a href="https://app.candid.org/profile/9571629/openai-81-0861541?activeTab=7">had removed “safely” from its mission statement</a>, among other changes. That change in wording coincided with its <a href="https://theconversation.com/as-openai-attracts-billions-in-new-investment-its-goal-of-balancing-profit-with-purpose-is-getting-more-challenging-to-pull-off-240602">transformation from a nonprofit organization</a> into a business <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/11/technology/openai-revenue-challenge.html">increasingly focused on profits</a>.</p>

<p>OpenAI currently faces <a href="https://www.transparencycoalition.ai/news/seven-more-lawsuits-filed-against-openai-for-chatgpt-suicide-coaching">several lawsuits</a> related to its products’ safety, making this change newsworthy. Many of the plaintiffs suing the AI company allege psychological manipulation, wrongful death and assisted suicide, while others have filed negligence claims.</p>

<p>As a scholar of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&amp;hl=en&amp;user=_-YZrXgAAAAJ&amp;citation_for_view=_-YZrXgAAAAJ:hC7cP41nSMkC">nonprofit accountability</a> and the <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&amp;hl=en&amp;user=_-YZrXgAAAAJ&amp;citation_for_view=_-YZrXgAAAAJ:_kc_bZDykSQC">governance of social enterprises</a>, I see the deletion of the word “safely” from its mission statement as a significant shift that has largely gone unreported – outside <a href="https://news.aibase.com/news/22994">highly specialized outlets</a>.</p>

<p>And I believe OpenAI’s makeover is a test case for how we, as a society, oversee the work of organizations that have the potential to both provide enormous benefits and do catastrophic harm. </p>



<h2>Tracing OpenAI’s origins</h2>

<p>OpenAI, which also makes the Sora video artificial intelligence app, was founded as a nonprofit scientific research lab in 2015. Its original purpose was to benefit society by <a href="https://perma.cc/MXE3-FJ7F">making its findings public and royalty-free</a> rather than to make money. </p>

<p>To raise the money that developing its AI models would require, OpenAI, under the leadership of CEO Sam Altman, created a <a href="https://openai.com/our-structure/">for-profit subsidiary in 2019</a>. Microsoft initially invested US$1 billion in this venture; by 2024 that sum had topped $13 billion.</p>

<p>In exchange, Microsoft was promised a portion of future profits, capped at 100 times its initial investment. But the software giant didn’t get a seat on OpenAI’s nonprofit board – meaning it lacked the power to help steer the AI venture it was funding.</p>

<p>A subsequent round of funding in late 2024, which raised $6.6 billion from multiple investors, came with a catch: that the funding would become debt <a href="https://theconversation.com/as-openai-attracts-billions-in-new-investment-its-goal-of-balancing-profit-with-purpose-is-getting-more-challenging-to-pull-off-240602">unless OpenAI converted to a more traditional for-profit business</a> in which investors could own shares, without any caps on profits, and possibly occupy board seats.  </p>

<h2>Establishing a new structure</h2>

<p>In October 2025, OpenAI reached an agreement with the attorneys general of California and Delaware to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/28/technology/openai-restructure-for-profit-company.html?searchResultPosition=6">become a more traditional for-profit company</a>.</p>

<p>Under the new arrangement, OpenAI was split into two entities: a nonprofit foundation and a for-profit business.  </p>

<p>The restructured nonprofit, the <a href="https://openai.com/foundation/">OpenAI Foundation</a>, owns about one-fourth of the stock in a new <a href="https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc15/">for-profit public benefit corporation</a>, the <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/openais-restructuring-sets-could-biggest-004100492.html">OpenAI Group</a>. Both are headquartered in California but <a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/26205026/openai-pbc-articles-of-incorporation.pdf">incorporated in Delaware</a>.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2020/08/31/delaware-public-benefit-corporations-recent-developments/">public benefit corporation</a> is a business that must consider interests beyond shareholders, such as those of society and the environment, and it must issue an annual benefit report to its shareholders and the public. However, it is up to the board to decide how to weigh those interests and what to report in terms of the benefits and harms caused by the company.  </p>

<p>The new structure is described in a <a href="https://cdn.theconversation.com/static_files/files/4101/Final_Executed_MOU_Between_OpenAI_and_California_AG_re_Notice_of_Conditions_of_Non-Objection_%2810.27.2025%29_%28Signed_by_OpenAI%29_%28Signed_by_CA_DOJ%29.pdf?1770844719">memorandum of understanding</a> signed in October 2025 by OpenAI and the California attorney general, and <a href="https://news.delaware.gov/2025/10/28/ag-jennings-completes-review-of-openai-recapitalization/">endorsed by the Delaware attorney general</a>.</p>

<p>Many business media outlets heralded the move, predicting that it would <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/openai-converts-to-public-benefit-corporation-with-microsoft-taking-27-stake-714a6c05">usher in more investment</a>. Two months later, SoftBank, a Japanese conglomerate, finalized a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/softbank-has-fully-funded-its-40-billion-investment-openai-cnbc-reports-2025-12-30/">$41 billion investment in OpenAI</a>.</p>

<h2>Changing its mission statement</h2>

<p>Most charities must <a href="https://theconversation.com/whats-a-990-form-a-charity-accounting-expert-explains-175019">file forms annually with the Internal Revenue Service</a> with details about their missions, activities and financial status to show that they qualify for tax-exempt status. Because the IRS makes the forms public, they have become a way for nonprofits to signal their missions to the world.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://app.candid.org/profile/9571629/openai-81-0861541?activeTab=7">its forms for 2022</a>, <a href="https://cdn.theconversation.com/static_files/files/4099/2023-IRS990-OpenAI.pdf?1770819990">and 2023</a>, OpenAI said its mission was “to build general-purpose artificial intelligence (AI) that safely benefits humanity, unconstrained by a need to generate financial return.”</p>

<p>OpenAI had dropped its commitment to safety from its mission statement – along with a commitment to being “unconstrained” by a need to make money for investors. According to Platformer, a tech media outlet, it has also disbanded its “<a href="https://www.platformer.news/openai-mission-alignment-team-joshua-achiam/">mission alignment</a>” team.</p>

<p>In my view, these changes explicitly signal that OpenAI is making its profits a higher priority than the safety of its products.</p>

<p>To be sure, OpenAI continues to mention safety when it <a href="https://openai.com/index/why-our-structure-must-evolve-to-advance-our-mission/">discusses its mission</a>. “We view this mission as the most important challenge of our time,” it states on its website. “It requires simultaneously advancing AI’s capability, safety, and positive impact in the world.”</p>

<h2>Revising its legal governance structure</h2>

<p>Nonprofit boards are responsible for key decisions and <a href="https://theconversation.com/openai-is-a-nonprofit-corporate-hybrid-a-management-expert-explains-how-this-model-works-and-how-it-fueled-the-tumult-around-ceo-sam-altmans-short-lived-ouster-218340">upholding their organization’s mission</a>.</p>

<p>Unlike private companies, board members of <a href="https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/charitable-organizations/exemption-requirements-501c3-organizations">tax-exempt charitable nonprofits</a> cannot personally enrich themselves by taking a share of earnings. In cases where a nonprofit owns a for-profit business, as OpenAI did with its previous structure, investors can take a cut of profits – but they typically do not get a seat on the board or have an opportunity to elect board members, because that would be seen as a conflict of interest.  </p>

<p>The OpenAI Foundation now has a 26% stake in OpenAI Group. In effect, that means that the nonprofit board has given up nearly three-quarters of its control over the company. Software giant Microsoft owns a slightly larger stake – 27% of OpenAI’s stock – due to its <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/11/03/open-ai-move-made-microsoft-no-brainer-buy/">$13.8 billion investment in the AI company</a> to date. OpenAI’s employees and its other investors own the rest of the shares. </p>

<h2>Seeking more investment</h2>

<p>The main goal of OpenAI’s restructuring, which it called a “<a href="https://openai.com/index/built-to-benefit-everyone/">recapitalization</a>,” was to attract more private investment in the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbesbusinesscouncil/2025/02/27/the-ai-arms-race-deepseek-vs-openai-and-the-battle-for-global-ai-dominance/">race for AI dominance</a>.</p>

<p>It has already succeeded on that front.</p>

<p>As of early February 2026, the company was in talks with SoftBank for an <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/softbank-talks-invest-up-30-billion-more-openai-wsj-reports-2026-01-28/">additional $30 billion</a> and stands to get up to a total of <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/amazon-talks-invest-up-50-billion-openai-wsj-reports-2026-01-29/">$60 billion from Amazon, Nvidia and Microsoft</a> combined.</p>

<p>OpenAI is now valued at over <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/02/openai-share-sale-500-billion-valuation.html">$500 billion</a>, up from <a href="https://tracxn.com/d/companies/openai/__kElhSG7uVGeFk1i71Co9-nwFtmtyMVT7f-YHMn4TFBg/funding-and-investors#funding-rounds">$300 billion</a> in March 2025. The new structure also paves the way for an eventual <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ipo.asp">initial public offering</a>, which, if it happens, would not only help the company <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/openai-ipo-anthropic-race-69f06a42">raise more capital through stock markets</a> but would also increase the pressure to make money for its shareholders.</p>

<p>OpenAI says the foundation’s endowment is <a href="https://openai.com/index/built-to-benefit-everyone/">worth about $130 billion</a>.</p>

<p>Those numbers are only estimates because OpenAI is a privately held company without publicly traded shares. That means these figures are based on market value estimates rather than any objective evidence, such as market capitalization.</p>

<p>When he <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-bonta-issues-statement-openai%E2%80%99s-recapitalization-plan">announced the new structure</a>, California Attorney General Rob Bonta said, “We secured concessions that ensure charitable assets are used for their intended purpose.” He also predicted that “safety will be prioritized” and said the “top priority is, and always will be, protecting our kids.”  </p>

<h2>Steps that might help keep people safe</h2>

<p>At the same time, several conditions in the OpenAI restructuring memo are designed to promote safety, including:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>A safety and security committee on the OpenAI Foundation board has the authority to <a href="https://cdn.theconversation.com/static_files/files/4101/Final_Executed_MOU_Between_OpenAI_and_California_AG_re_Notice_of_Conditions_of_Non-Objection_%2810.27.2025%29_%28Signed_by_OpenAI%29_%28Signed_by_CA_DOJ%29.pdf?1770844719">“require mitigation measures”</a> that could potentially include the halting of a release of new OpenAI products based on assessments of their risks. </p></li>
<li><p>The for-profit OpenAI Group has its own board, which must consider only OpenAI’s mission – rather than financial issues – regarding safety and security issues.</p></li>
<li><p>The OpenAI Foundation’s nonprofit board gets to appoint all members of the OpenAI Group’s for-profit board.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>But given that neither the mission of the foundation nor of the OpenAI group explicitly alludes to safety, it will be hard to hold their boards accountable for it. </p>

<p>Furthermore, since <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2025-10-30/openai-restructure-paves-way-for-ipo-and-ai-spending-spree">all but one board member currently serve on both boards</a>, it is hard to see how they might oversee themselves. And <a href="https://cdn.theconversation.com/static_files/files/4101/Final_Executed_MOU_Between_OpenAI_and_California_AG_re_Notice_of_Conditions_of_Non-Objection_%2810.27.2025%29_%28Signed_by_OpenAI%29_%28Signed_by_CA_DOJ%29.pdf?1770844719">the memorandum signed by the California attorney general</a> doesn’t indicate whether he was aware of the removal of any reference to safety from the mission statement.</p>

<h2>Identifying other paths OpenAI could have taken</h2>

<p>There are alternative models that I believe would serve the public interest better than this one.</p>

<p>When Health Net, a California nonprofit <a href="https://www.medicare.gov/health-drug-plans/health-plans/your-health-plan-options/HMO">health maintenance organization</a>, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1992-02-08-fi-1192-story.html">converted to a for-profit insurance company</a> in 1992, regulators required that 80% of its equity be transferred to another <a href="https://www.calwellness.org/mission/our-story/">nonprofit health foundation</a>. Unlike with OpenAI, the foundation had majority control after the transformation.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.eyesonopenai.org/">coalition of California nonprofits</a> has argued that the attorney general should require OpenAI to transfer all of its assets to an independent nonprofit.  </p>

<p>Another example is <a href="https://www.lenfestinstitute.org/our-work/the-philadelphia-inquirer/">The Philadelphia Inquirer</a>. The Pennsylvania newspaper <a href="https://current.org/2016/04/as-philadelphia-newspapers-turn-to-nonprofits-who-is-public-media/">became a for-profit public benefit corporation</a> in 2016. It belongs to the Lenfest Institute, a nonprofit.</p>

<p>This structure allows Philadelphia’s biggest newspaper to attract investment without compromising its purpose – journalism serving the needs of its local communities. It’s become a model for potentially <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/opinion/commentary/press-forward-lenfest-institute-journalism-philanthropy-american-democracy-20230907.html">transforming the local news industry</a>. </p>

<p>At this point, I believe that the public bears the burden of two governance failures. One is that OpenAI’s board has apparently abandoned its mission of safety. And the other is that the attorneys general of California and Delaware have let that happen.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				
<p>My personal blog here is dedicated to tech geek material, mostly about databases like postgres. I don’t get political, but at the moment I’m so irritated that I’m making the extraordinary exception to veer into the territory of flame-war opinionating…</p>



<p>This relates to Postgres because <a href="https://theshamblog.com/an-ai-agent-published-a-hit-piece-on-me/">Scott is a volunteer maintainer on an open source project called matplotlib</a> and the topic is something that we are all navigating in the open source space. Last night at the Seattle Postgres User Group meetup <a href="https://www.meetup.com/seattle-postgres/events/313043951/">Claire Giordano gave a presentation about how the postgres community works</a> and this was one of the first topics that came up in the Q&amp;A at the end! Like every open source project, Postgres is trying to figure out how to deal with the rapid change of the industry as new, powerful, useful AI tools enable us to do things we couldn’t do before (which is great). Just two weeks ago, <a href="https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/governance/blob/main/AI_POLICY.md">the CloudNativePG project released an AI Policy</a> which builds on work from the Linux Foundation and discussion around the Ghostty policy. We’re in the middle of figuring this out and we’re working hard.</p>



<p>Just now, I saw this headline on the front page of the Wall Street Journal:</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="4957" data-permalink="https://ardentperf.com/2026/02/13/the-scott-shambaugh-situation-clarifies-how-dumb-we-are-acting/image-62/" data-orig-file="https://ardentperf.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-8.png" data-orig-size="1384,404" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://ardentperf.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-8.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://ardentperf.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-8.png?w=750" width="1024" height="298" src="https://ardentperf.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-8.png?w=1024" alt="" srcset="https://ardentperf.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-8.png?w=1024 1024w, https://ardentperf.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-8.png?w=150 150w, https://ardentperf.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-8.png?w=300 300w, https://ardentperf.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-8.png?w=768 768w, https://ardentperf.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-8.png 1384w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>I personally find this to be outright alarming.  And it’s the most clear expression that I’ve seen of <strong>deeply wrong, deeply concerning language</strong> we’ve all been observing. Many of us in tech communities are complicit in this, and now even press outlets like the WSJ are joining us in complicity.</p>



<p>Corrected headline: <strong>Software Engineer Responsible for Bullying, Due to Irresponsible Use of AI, Has Not Yet Apologized</strong></p>



<p>This article uses language I hear people use all the time in the tech community: <em>Several hours later, the bot apologized to Shambaugh for being “inappropriate and personal.”</em></p>



<p>This language basically <strong>removes </strong>accountability and responsibility from the human, who configured an AI agent with the ability to publish content that looks like a blog with zero editorial control – and I haven’t looked deeply but it seems like there may not be clear attribution of who the human is, that’s responsible for this content.</p>



<p>We all need to collectively take a breath and stop repeating this nonsense. A human created this, manages this, and is responsible for this.</p>



<p>It’s one thing when I hear this dumb language on LinkedIn, but I’m alarmed to see it on the front page of a major media outlet like the journal.</p>



<p>Our contributions to dialogue in the tech industry – on LinkedIn, at meetups, with coworkers, at conferences, on other social media, etc – these all make small contributions to our culture. Poor American culture seems in a weird cycle sometimes of taking a very long time to acknowledge very common-sense things, because vested interests (often with much financial motivation) want to push a certain narrative and everyone knows it’s bunk but nobody says so. Personally i think this applies to a wide array of issues, not just tech.</p>



<p>Folks, please speak up about stuff that’s stupid obvious. Bullying of open source maintainers should be alarming to us, and whoever the person is that’s responsible for this needs to step up and take responsibility.  Personally.</p>



<p>And we all need to dial back this over-the-top anthropomorphizing of useful electronic gadgets that we’re building and selling.</p>

<span><span># cloudrouter - Cloud Sandboxes for Development</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter manages cloud sandboxes for development. Use these commands to create, manage, and access remote development environments with GPU support and browser automation.</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>## When this skill is invoked</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>When the user invokes </span><span>`/cloudrouter`</span><span> or </span><span>`/cr`</span><span> without a specific task, present the available modes:</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>```</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter - Cloud Development Sandboxes</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>  Modes:</span></span>
<span><span>    cloudrouter start .                    Sync current directory to a cloud sandbox</span></span>
<span><span>    cloudrouter start --size small .       Smaller sandbox (2 vCPU, 8 GB)</span></span>
<span><span>    cloudrouter start --gpu T4 .           Sandbox with T4 GPU (16GB VRAM)</span></span>
<span><span>    cloudrouter start --gpu A100 .         Sandbox with A100 GPU (40GB VRAM)</span></span>
<span><span>    cloudrouter start --gpu H100 .         Sandbox with H100 GPU (80GB VRAM)</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>  Manage:</span></span>
<span><span>    cloudrouter ls                         List all sandboxes</span></span>
<span><span>    cloudrouter code &lt;id&gt;                  Open VS Code in browser</span></span>
<span><span>    cloudrouter jupyter &lt;id&gt;               Open Jupyter Lab in browser</span></span>
<span><span>    cloudrouter pty &lt;id&gt;                   Open terminal session</span></span>
<span><span>    cloudrouter vnc &lt;id&gt;                   Open VNC desktop</span></span>
<span><span>    cloudrouter stop &lt;id&gt;                  Pause sandbox</span></span>
<span><span>    cloudrouter resume &lt;id&gt;                Resume paused sandbox</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>  Browser automation:</span></span>
<span><span>    cloudrouter browser snapshot -i &lt;id&gt;       Get interactive elements</span></span>
<span><span>    cloudrouter browser open &lt;id&gt; &lt;url&gt;        Navigate to URL</span></span>
<span><span>    cloudrouter browser screenshot &lt;id&gt;        Take screenshot</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>  Run "cloudrouter start --help" for all options.</span></span>
<span><span>```</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>## Setup</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>**Before doing anything else, always run this command at the start of any cloudrouter task.**</span><span> Do not ask the user — just run it automatically:</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>```bash</span></span>
<span><span>npm</span><span> install</span><span> -g</span><span> @manaflow-ai/cloudrouter</span><span>   # Install/update CLI</span></span>
<span><span>```</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>This is idempotent — safe to run even if already up to date. This ensures the agent always has the latest CLI.</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>This installs both </span><span>`cloudrouter`</span><span> and </span><span>`cr`</span><span> (shorthand) as CLI commands.</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>Then authenticate:</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>```bash</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> login</span></span>
<span><span>```</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>If the user hasn't logged in yet, prompt them to run </span><span>`cloudrouter login`</span><span> first before using any other commands.</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>## Quick Start</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>```bash</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> login</span><span>                        # Authenticate (opens browser)</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> start</span><span> .</span><span>                      # Create sandbox from current directory</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> start</span><span> --gpu</span><span> T4</span><span> .</span><span>             # Create sandbox with GPU</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> start</span><span> --size</span><span> small</span><span> .</span><span>         # Create smaller sandbox</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> code</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span>                    # Open VS Code</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> jupyter</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span>                 # Open Jupyter Lab</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> pty</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span>                     # Open terminal session</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> ls</span><span>                           # List all sandboxes</span></span>
<span><span>```</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>&gt; </span><span>**Preferred:**</span><span> Always use </span><span>`cloudrouter start .`</span><span> or </span><span>`cloudrouter start &lt;local-path&gt;`</span><span> to sync your local directory to a cloud sandbox. This is the recommended workflow over cloning from a git repo.</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>## Commands</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>### Authentication</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>```bash</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> login</span><span>               # Login (opens browser)</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> logout</span><span>              # Logout and clear credentials</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> whoami</span><span>              # Show current user and team</span></span>
<span><span>```</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>### Creating Sandboxes</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>```bash</span></span>
<span><span># Standard sandbox (syncs local directory) — DO NOT pass --size, default is large (8 vCPU, 32 GB)</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> start</span><span> .</span><span>                        # Create from current directory (recommended)</span></span>

<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> start</span><span> -n</span><span> my-sandbox</span><span> .</span><span>          # Create with a custom name</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span># Size presets — only use if the user specifically requests a different size</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> start</span><span> --size</span><span> small</span><span> .</span><span>           # 2 vCPU, 8 GB RAM, 20 GB disk — only if user asks</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> start</span><span> --size</span><span> medium</span><span> .</span><span>          # 4 vCPU, 16 GB RAM, 40 GB disk — only if user asks</span></span>

<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> start</span><span> --size</span><span> xlarge</span><span> .</span><span>          # 16 vCPU, 64 GB RAM, 160 GB disk — only if user asks</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span># With GPU (auto-selects Modal provider)</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> start</span><span> --gpu</span><span> T4</span><span> .</span><span>               # T4 GPU (16GB VRAM)</span></span>

<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> start</span><span> --gpu</span><span> H100:2</span><span> .</span><span>           # Multi-GPU: 2x H100</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span># With custom resources (override --size values)</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> start</span><span> --cpu</span><span> 12</span><span> --memory</span><span> 49152</span><span> .</span><span>  # Custom CPU and memory</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> start</span><span> --disk</span><span> 100</span><span> .</span><span>               # Custom disk size (GB)</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> start</span><span> --image</span><span> ubuntu:22.04</span><span> .</span><span>     # Custom container image</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span># From git repo (URL as positional arg or --git flag)</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> start</span><span> https://github.com/user/repo</span><span>    # Clone git repo directly</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> start</span><span> --git</span><span> user/repo</span><span>                  # Clone via shorthand</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> start</span><span> --git</span><span> user/repo</span><span> -b</span><span> main</span><span>          # Clone specific branch</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span># Provider selection</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> start</span><span> -p</span><span> e2b</span><span> .</span><span>                 # Use E2B provider (default)</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> start</span><span> -p</span><span> modal</span><span> .</span><span>               # Use Modal provider</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span># Custom timeout</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> start</span><span> --timeout</span><span> 1800</span><span> .</span><span>         # 30-minute timeout (default: 600s = 10 min)</span></span>
<span><span>```</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>### Size Presets</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>| Size | vCPU | RAM | Disk | Notes |</span></span>
<span><span>|------|------|-----|------|-------|</span></span>
<span><span>| small | 2 | 8 GB | 20 GB | Light tasks |</span></span>
<span><span>| medium | 4 | 16 GB | 40 GB | Standard development |</span></span>
<span><span>| large | 8 | 32 GB | 80 GB | </span><span>**Default**</span><span> |</span></span>
<span><span>| xlarge | 16 | 64 GB | 160 GB | Heavy workloads |</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>**Do NOT pass </span><span>`--size`</span><span> unless the user explicitly asks for a specific size.**</span><span> The default is </span><span>`large`</span><span> (8 vCPU, 32 GB) which is appropriate for most tasks. Using </span><span>`--size small`</span><span> unnecessarily will make builds slower and may cause out-of-memory issues.</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>Individual resource flags (</span><span>`--cpu`</span><span>, </span><span>`--memory`</span><span>, </span><span>`--disk`</span><span>) override </span><span>`--size`</span><span> values.</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>### GPU Options</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>| GPU | VRAM | Best For | Availability |</span></span>
<span><span>|-----|------|----------|-------------|</span></span>
<span><span>| T4 | 16GB | Inference, fine-tuning small models | Self-serve |</span></span>
<span><span>| L4 | 24GB | Inference, image generation | Self-serve |</span></span>
<span><span>| A10G | 24GB | Training medium models | Self-serve |</span></span>

<span><span>GPUs requiring approval: contact founders@manaflow.ai.</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>Multi-GPU: append </span><span>`:N`</span><span> to the GPU type, e.g. </span><span>`--gpu H100:2`</span><span> for 2x H100.</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>### All </span><span>`start`</span><span> Flags</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>```</span></span>
<span><span>-n, --name &lt;name&gt;       Name for the sandbox</span></span>
<span><span>-o, --open              Open VS Code after creation</span></span>
<span><span>    --size &lt;preset&gt;     Machine size: small, medium, large (default), xlarge</span></span>
<span><span>    --gpu &lt;type&gt;        GPU type (T4, L4, A10G, L40S, A100, H100, H200, B200)</span></span>
<span><span>    --cpu &lt;cores&gt;       CPU cores (overrides --size)</span></span>
<span><span>    --memory &lt;MiB&gt;      Memory in MiB (overrides --size)</span></span>
<span><span>    --disk &lt;GB&gt;         Disk size in GB (overrides --size)</span></span>
<span><span>    --image &lt;image&gt;     Container image (e.g., ubuntu:22.04)</span></span>
<span><span>    --git &lt;repo&gt;        Git repository URL or user/repo shorthand</span></span>
<span><span>-b, --branch &lt;branch&gt;   Git branch to clone</span></span>
<span><span>-p, --provider &lt;name&gt;   Sandbox provider: e2b (default), modal</span></span>
<span><span>-T, --template &lt;id&gt;     Template ID — DO NOT use template names from `cloudrouter templates`; use --gpu flags instead</span></span>
<span><span>    --timeout &lt;secs&gt;    Sandbox timeout in seconds (default: 600 = 10 minutes)</span></span>
<span><span>```</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>&gt; </span><span>**Warning:**</span><span> Do NOT pass template names (e.g. </span><span>`cmux-devbox-base`</span><span>) to the </span><span>`-T`</span><span> flag. These are display names, not valid template IDs.</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>&gt; </span><span>**Aliases:**</span><span> `cloudrouter start`</span><span>, </span><span>`cloudrouter create`</span><span>, </span><span>`cloudrouter new`</span><span> all do the same thing.</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>### Managing Sandboxes</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>```bash</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> ls</span><span>                           # List all sandboxes</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> ls</span><span> -p</span><span> modal</span><span>                  # List only GPU sandboxes</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> ls</span><span> -p</span><span> e2b</span><span>                    # List only Docker sandboxes</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> status</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span>                  # Show sandbox details and URLs</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> stop</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span>                    # Pause sandbox (preserves state, can resume)</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> pause</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span>                   # Same as stop — alias</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> resume</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span>                  # Resume a paused sandbox</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> extend</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span>                  # Extend sandbox timeout (default: +1 hour)</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> extend</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span> --seconds</span><span> 7200</span><span>   # Extend by 2 hours</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> delete</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span>                  # Delete sandbox permanently</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> templates</span><span>                    # List available templates</span></span>
<span><span>```</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>&gt; </span><span>**Important:**</span><span> `stop`</span><span> and </span><span>`pause`</span><span> are the same command — they preserve sandbox state. Use </span><span>`resume`</span><span> to bring a paused sandbox back. Use </span><span>`delete`</span><span> (aliases: </span><span>`rm`</span><span>, </span><span>`kill`</span><span>) to permanently destroy a sandbox.</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>&gt; </span><span>**Do NOT use </span><span>`--timeout`</span><span>**</span><span> with </span><span>`extend`</span><span> — the flag is </span><span>`--seconds`</span><span>.</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>### Access Sandbox</span></span>

<span><span>```</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>### Work with Sandbox</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>```bash</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> pty</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span>                       # Interactive terminal session (use for ongoing work)</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> ssh</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span> &lt;</span><span>comman</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span>             # Execute a one-off command via SSH</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> ssh</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span> "ls -la"</span><span>              # Run a command (always quote the command string)</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> pty-list</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span>                  # List active PTY sessions</span></span>
<span><span>```</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>&gt; </span><span>**Important:**</span><span> Prefer </span><span>`cloudrouter pty`</span><span> for interactive work. Use </span><span>`cloudrouter ssh`</span><span> for quick one-off commands.</span></span>
<span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span><span>&gt; </span><span>**CRITICAL: Always quote the command string.**</span><span> `cloudrouter ssh &lt;id&gt; ls -la`</span><span> will FAIL because </span><span>`-la`</span><span> is parsed as a cloudrouter flag. Always wrap in quotes: </span><span>`cloudrouter ssh &lt;id&gt; "ls -la"`</span><span>.</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>#### IMPORTANT: Fix npm Permissions Before Any npm Command</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>**ALWAYS run this before </span><span>`npm install`</span><span> or any npm command in a new sandbox:**</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>```bash</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> ssh</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span> "sudo chown -R 1000:1000 /home/user/.npm"</span></span>
<span><span>```</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>Without this, </span><span>`npm install`</span><span> will fail with EACCES/ENOENT errors on </span><span>`.npm/_cacache`</span><span>. This must be done </span><span>**once per sandbox, before the first npm operation**</span><span>. Do not skip this step.</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>### File Transfer</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>Upload and download files or directories between local machine and sandbox.</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>**Command signatures:**</span></span>
<span><span>-</span><span> `cloudrouter upload &lt;id&gt; [local-path]`</span><span> — accepts 1-2 positional args: sandbox ID and optional local path</span></span>
<span><span>-</span><span> `cloudrouter download &lt;id&gt; [local-path]`</span><span> — accepts 1-2 positional args: sandbox ID and optional local path</span></span>
<span><span>-</span><span> Use </span><span>`-r &lt;remote-path&gt;`</span><span> flag to specify a non-default remote directory (default: </span><span>`/home/user/workspace`</span><span>)</span></span>
<span><span>-</span><span> **Do NOT pass remote paths as positional arguments**</span><span> — this will error. Always use the </span><span>`-r`</span><span> flag.</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>```bash</span></span>
<span><span># Upload (local -&gt; sandbox)</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> upload</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span>                            # Upload current dir to /home/user/workspace</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> upload</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span> ./my-project</span><span>               # Upload directory to workspace</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> upload</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span> ./config.json</span><span>              # Upload single file to workspace</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> upload</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span> .</span><span> -r</span><span> /home/user/app</span><span>        # Upload to specific remote path</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> upload</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span> .</span><span> --watch</span><span>                  # Watch and re-upload on changes</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> upload</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span> .</span><span> --delete</span><span>                 # Delete remote files not present locally</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> upload</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span> .</span><span> -e</span><span> "*.log"</span><span>               # Exclude patterns</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> upload</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span> .</span><span> --dry-run</span><span>                # Preview without making changes</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span># Download (sandbox -&gt; local)</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> download</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span>                          # Download workspace to current dir</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> download</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span> ./output</span><span>                 # Download workspace to ./output</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> download</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span> ./output</span><span> -r</span><span> /home/user/app</span><span>  # Download specific remote dir to ./output</span></span>
<span><span>```</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>&gt; </span><span>**Warning:**</span><span> The </span><span>`-r`</span><span> flag expects a </span><span>**directory**</span><span> path, not a file path. To download a single file, download its parent directory and then access the file locally.</span></span>
<span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span><span>&gt; </span><span>**Common mistake:**</span><span> `cloudrouter download &lt;id&gt; /remote/path /local/path`</span><span> — this passes 3 positional args and will fail. Use </span><span>`cloudrouter download &lt;id&gt; /local/path -r /remote/path`</span><span> instead.</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>### Browser Automation (</span><span>`cloudrouter browser`</span><span>)</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>Control Chrome browser in the sandbox via agent-browser. The </span><span>`cloudrouter browser`</span><span> command wraps [</span><span>agent-browser</span><span>](</span><span>https://github.com/vercel-labs/agent-browser</span><span>) and runs commands inside the sandbox via SSH.</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>&gt; </span><span>**Startup delay:**</span><span> The browser may not be ready immediately after sandbox creation. If a </span><span>`browser`</span><span> command fails right after </span><span>`cloudrouter start`</span><span>, wait a few seconds and retry.</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>#### Navigation</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>```bash</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> browser</span><span> open</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span> &lt;</span><span>ur</span><span>l</span><span>&gt;</span><span>        # Navigate to URL</span></span>

<span><span>```</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>#### Inspect Page</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>```bash</span></span>

<span></span>
<span><span>#### Interact with Elements</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>```bash</span></span>

<span><span>```</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>#### Wait Commands</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>```bash</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> browser</span><span> wait</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span> @e1</span><span>                  # Wait for element to appear</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> browser</span><span> wait</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span> 2000</span><span>                 # Wait milliseconds</span></span>
<span><span>```</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>#### Get Information</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>```bash</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> browser</span><span> get-text</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span> @e1</span><span>              # Get element text content</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> browser</span><span> get-value</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span> @e2</span><span>             # Get input value</span></span>

<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> browser</span><span> get-html</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span> @e4</span><span>              # Get innerHTML</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> browser</span><span> get-count</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span> ".item"</span><span>         # Count matching elements</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> browser</span><span> get-box</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span> @e5</span><span>               # Get bounding box</span></span>

<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> browser</span><span> is-enabled</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span> @e1</span><span>            # Check if element is enabled</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> browser</span><span> is-checked</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span> @e1</span><span>            # Check if checkbox is checked</span></span>
<span><span>```</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>#### Semantic Locators (alternative to refs)</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>When element refs are unreliable (dynamic pages), use semantic locators:</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>```bash</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> browser</span><span> find</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span> text</span><span> "Sign In"</span><span> click</span><span>              # Find by visible text and click</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> browser</span><span> find</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span> label</span><span> "Email"</span><span> fill</span><span> "user@test.com"</span><span> # Find by label and fill</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> browser</span><span> find</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span> placeholder</span><span> "Search"</span><span> type</span><span> "query"</span><span>  # Find by placeholder</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> browser</span><span> find</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span> testid</span><span> "submit-btn"</span><span> click</span><span>          # Find by data-testid</span></span>
<span><span>```</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>&gt; </span><span>**Note:**</span><span> `find &lt;id&gt; role button click`</span><span> finds the FIRST button on the page — it cannot filter by button name. Use </span><span>`find &lt;id&gt; text "Button Name" click`</span><span> to target a specific button by its visible text. There is no </span><span>`--name`</span><span> flag.</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>#### JavaScript &amp; Console</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>```bash</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> browser</span><span> eval</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span> "document.title"</span><span>                   # Evaluate JavaScript</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> browser</span><span> console</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span>                                 # View console messages</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> browser</span><span> errors</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span>                                  # View JavaScript errors</span></span>
<span><span>```</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>#### Tabs &amp; Frames</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>```bash</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> browser</span><span> tab-list</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span>                  # List open tabs</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> browser</span><span> tab-new</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span> "https://..."</span><span>     # Open new tab</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> browser</span><span> tab-switch</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span> 2</span><span>              # Switch to tab by index</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> browser</span><span> tab-close</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span>                 # Close current tab</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> browser</span><span> frame</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span> "#iframe-selector"</span><span>  # Switch to iframe</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> browser</span><span> frame</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span> main</span><span>                # Switch back to main frame</span></span>
<span><span>```</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>#### Cookies &amp; Storage</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>```bash</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> browser</span><span> cookies</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span>                   # List cookies</span></span>

<span></span>
<span><span>#### State Management</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>```bash</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> browser</span><span> state-save</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span> /tmp/auth.json</span><span>   # Save cookies, storage, auth state</span></span>

<span><span>```</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>#### Browser Settings</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>```bash</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> browser</span><span> set-viewport</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span> 1920</span><span> 1080</span><span>    # Set viewport size</span></span>

<span><span>```</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>#### Network Interception</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>```bash</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> browser</span><span> network-route</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span> "**/api/*"</span><span>            # Intercept requests</span></span>

<span><span>```</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>#### Dialogs</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>```bash</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> browser</span><span> dialog-accept</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span>             # Accept alert/confirm/prompt</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> browser</span><span> dialog-accept</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span> "answer"</span><span>    # Accept prompt with text</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> browser</span><span> dialog-dismiss</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span>            # Dismiss dialog</span></span>
<span><span>```</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>#### Element Selectors</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>Two ways to select elements:</span></span>
<span><span>-</span><span> **Element refs**</span><span> from snapshot: </span><span>`@e1`</span><span>, </span><span>`@e2`</span><span>, </span><span>`@e3`</span><span>... (preferred — from </span><span>`cloudrouter browser snapshot -i`</span><span>)</span></span>
<span><span>-</span><span> **CSS selectors**</span><span>: </span><span>`#id`</span><span>, </span><span>`.class`</span><span>, </span><span>`button[type="submit"]`</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>Snapshot output shows refs as </span><span>`[ref=e1]`</span><span>, but when using them in commands, prefix with </span><span>`@`</span><span>: e.g., </span><span>`@e1`</span><span>.</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>#### Tips for Effective Browser Automation</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>1.</span><span> **Flags go BEFORE the sandbox ID.**</span><span> This is critical. </span><span>`cloudrouter browser snapshot -i &lt;id&gt;`</span><span> works. </span><span>`cloudrouter browser snapshot &lt;id&gt; -i`</span><span> silently returns empty/wrong results. Always put flags like </span><span>`-i`</span><span>, </span><span>`-c`</span><span>, </span><span>`--full`</span><span> before the sandbox ID.</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>2.</span><span> **Always snapshot before interacting.**</span><span> Never use </span><span>`@e1`</span><span> without a preceding </span><span>`cloudrouter browser snapshot -i &lt;id&gt;`</span><span>. Refs don't exist until you snapshot.</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>3.</span><span> **Always re-snapshot after DOM changes.**</span><span> After any click that navigates, opens a dropdown, submits a form, or triggers dynamic content — snapshot again. Old refs may point to different elements.</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>4.</span><span> **Don't mix snapshot modes.**</span><span> Full </span><span>`snapshot`</span><span> and </span><span>`snapshot -i`</span><span> assign DIFFERENT ref numbers to the same elements. If you snapshot with </span><span>`-i`</span><span>, always interact using refs from that </span><span>`-i`</span><span> snapshot. Don't use refs from a full snapshot when you last ran </span><span>`-i`</span><span>, or vice versa.</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>5.</span><span> **Use </span><span>`snapshot -i`</span><span> (interactive only).**</span><span> The </span><span>`-i`</span><span> flag returns only actionable elements (buttons, inputs, links), which is far more efficient than the full accessibility tree. Stick to </span><span>`-i`</span><span> for all interactions.</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>6.</span><span> **Use </span><span>`fill`</span><span> not </span><span>`type`</span><span> for form fields.**</span><span> `fill`</span><span> clears existing content first, which is almost always what you want. </span><span>`type`</span><span> appends to existing content.</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>7.</span><span> **Wait after navigation.**</span><span> After clicking a link or submitting a form, use </span><span>`cloudrouter browser wait &lt;id&gt; 2000`</span><span> or wait for a specific element before snapshotting to ensure the page has fully loaded.</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>8.</span><span> **Verify navigation with </span><span>`url`</span><span> / </span><span>`title`</span><span>.**</span><span> After clicking a link or submitting a form, confirm you landed on the expected page.</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>9.</span><span> **Save auth state for reuse.**</span><span> After logging in, use </span><span>`cloudrouter browser state-save &lt;id&gt; /tmp/auth.json`</span><span> to persist cookies/storage. Reload with </span><span>`state-load`</span><span> in future sessions.</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>10.</span><span> **Fall back to semantic locators.**</span><span> If a page is highly dynamic and refs keep going stale, use </span><span>`cloudrouter browser find &lt;id&gt; text "Submit" click`</span><span> instead of refs.</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>&gt; </span><span>**Note:**</span><span> `cloudrouter browser`</span><span> commands run agent-browser inside the sandbox via SSH. Always use </span><span>`cloudrouter browser`</span><span> commands for browser automation.</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>## Sandbox IDs</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>Sandbox IDs look like </span><span>`cr_abc12345`</span><span>. Use the full ID when running commands. Get IDs from </span><span>`cloudrouter ls`</span><span> or </span><span>`cloudrouter start`</span><span> output.</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>## Common Workflows</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>### Create and develop in a sandbox (preferred: local-to-cloud)</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>```bash</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> start</span><span> ./my-project</span><span>                                      # Creates sandbox, uploads files</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> ssh</span><span> cr_abc123</span><span> "sudo chown -R 1000:1000 /home/user/.npm"</span><span> # ⚠ MUST run before any npm command</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> ssh</span><span> cr_abc123</span><span> "cd /home/user/workspace &amp;&amp; npm install"</span><span>   # Install dependencies</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> code</span><span> cr_abc123</span><span>                                          # Open VS Code</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> pty</span><span> cr_abc123</span><span>                                           # Open terminal (e.g. npm run dev)</span></span>
<span><span>```</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>### GPU workflow: ML training</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>```bash</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> start</span><span> --gpu</span><span> A100</span><span> ./ml-project</span><span>    # Sandbox with A100 GPU</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> pty</span><span> cr_abc123</span><span>                    # Open terminal</span></span>
<span><span># Inside: pip install -r requirements.txt &amp;&amp; python train.py</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> download</span><span> cr_abc123</span><span> ./checkpoints</span><span> # Download trained model</span></span>
<span><span>```</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>### Jupyter workflow</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>```bash</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> start</span><span> ./notebooks</span><span>         # Create sandbox</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> jupyter</span><span> cr_abc123</span><span>         # Open Jupyter Lab in browser</span></span>
<span><span>```</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>### File transfer workflow</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>```bash</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> upload</span><span> cr_abc123</span><span> ./my-project</span><span>     # Push local files to sandbox</span></span>
<span><span># ... do work in sandbox ...</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> download</span><span> cr_abc123</span><span> ./output</span><span>       # Pull files from sandbox to local</span></span>
<span><span>```</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>### Browser automation: Login to a website</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>```bash</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> browser</span><span> open</span><span> cr_abc123</span><span> "https://example.com/login"</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> browser</span><span> snapshot</span><span> -i</span><span> cr_abc123</span></span>
<span><span># Output: @e1 [input type="email"] placeholder="Email"</span></span>
<span><span>#         @e2 [input type="password"] placeholder="Password"</span></span>
<span><span>#         @e3 [button] "Sign In"</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> browser</span><span> fill</span><span> cr_abc123</span><span> @e1</span><span> "user@example.com"</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> browser</span><span> fill</span><span> cr_abc123</span><span> @e2</span><span> "password123"</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> browser</span><span> click</span><span> cr_abc123</span><span> @e3</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> browser</span><span> wait</span><span> cr_abc123</span><span> 2000</span><span>               # Wait for navigation</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> browser</span><span> snapshot</span><span> -i</span><span> cr_abc123</span><span>              # Re-snapshot after navigation!</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> browser</span><span> screenshot</span><span> cr_abc123</span><span> /tmp/result.png</span></span>
<span><span>```</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>### Browser automation: Scrape data</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>```bash</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> browser</span><span> open</span><span> cr_abc123</span><span> "https://example.com/data"</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> browser</span><span> wait</span><span> cr_abc123</span><span> 2000</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> browser</span><span> snapshot</span><span> -i</span><span> cr_abc123</span><span>     # Get interactive elements</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> browser</span><span> get-text</span><span> cr_abc123</span><span> @e5</span><span>    # Extract specific element text</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> browser</span><span> screenshot</span><span> cr_abc123</span><span>      # Visual capture</span></span>
<span><span>```</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>### Pause and resume workflow</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>```bash</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> stop</span><span> cr_abc123</span><span>            # Pause (preserves state)</span></span>
<span><span># ... later ...</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> resume</span><span> cr_abc123</span><span>          # Resume where you left off</span></span>
<span><span>```</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>### Sandbox Lifecycle &amp; Cleanup</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>**Concurrency limit:**</span><span> Users can have a maximum of </span><span>**10 concurrently running sandboxes**</span><span>. If the user is approaching this limit, alert them and suggest cleaning up unused sandboxes. If they need a higher limit, they should contact </span><span>**founders@manaflow.ai**</span><span> (the CLI will also display this message when the limit is hit).</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>**Cleanup rules — be careful and deliberate:**</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>1.</span><span> **Only touch sandboxes you created in this session.**</span><span> Never stop or delete sandboxes you didn't create or don't recognize. If you see unknown sandboxes in </span><span>`cloudrouter ls`</span><span>, leave them alone — they may belong to the user or another workflow.</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>2.</span><span> **Extend before cleanup.**</span><span> Before stopping or deleting a sandbox you created, consider whether the user might want to inspect it. If you built something the user should see (a running app, a trained model, browser automation results, etc.), </span><span>**extend the sandbox**</span><span> with </span><span>`cloudrouter extend &lt;id&gt;`</span><span> so the user has time to check it out. Share the relevant URL (VS Code, VNC, Jupyter, etc.) so they can access it.</span></span>
<span><span>   -</span><span> Use </span><span>`--seconds &lt;N&gt;`</span><span> to set a custom duration (default is 3600 = 1 hour). </span><span>**Do NOT use </span><span>`--timeout`</span><span>**</span><span> — that flag does not exist on </span><span>`extend`</span><span>.</span></span>
<span><span>   -</span><span> Example: </span><span>`cloudrouter extend cr_abc123 --seconds 1800`</span><span> extends by 30 minutes.</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>3.</span><span> **Stop (pause), don't delete, by default.**</span><span> Prefer </span><span>`cloudrouter stop &lt;id&gt;`</span><span> over </span><span>`cloudrouter delete &lt;id&gt;`</span><span> unless the sandbox is clearly disposable (e.g., a quick test that produced no artifacts). Stopped sandboxes can be resumed with </span><span>`cloudrouter resume &lt;id&gt;`</span><span>; deleted ones are gone forever. If </span><span>`cloudrouter stop`</span><span> fails (the VM may have died), the sandbox is likely already dead. You can use </span><span>`cloudrouter delete &lt;id&gt;`</span><span> to clean it up if the user needs sandbox slots freed, but don't delete proactively — only when the user needs more space or explicitly asks.</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>4.</span><span> **Clean up when you're done.**</span><span> When your task is complete and the user no longer needs the sandbox, stop it. Don't leave sandboxes running indefinitely — they count toward the concurrency limit.</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>5.</span><span> **Monitor concurrency.**</span><span> Before creating a new sandbox, run </span><span>`cloudrouter ls`</span><span> to check how many are running. If there are 8+ active sandboxes, warn the user and ask if any can be stopped before creating another. Never silently hit the limit.</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>6.</span><span> **If the limit is reached:**</span><span> Tell the user they've hit the 10-sandbox concurrency limit. Suggest stopping sandboxes they no longer need. If they need more capacity, direct them to contact </span><span>**founders@manaflow.ai**</span><span> to request a higher limit.</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>**Cleanup workflow:**</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>```bash</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> ls</span><span>                                   # Check running sandboxes and count</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> extend</span><span> cr_abc123</span><span>                     # Extend by 1 hour (default)</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> extend</span><span> cr_abc123</span><span> --seconds</span><span> 3600</span><span>      # Extend by custom duration</span></span>
<span><span># ... share URLs, let user verify ...</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> stop</span><span> cr_abc123</span><span>                       # Pause when done (can resume later)</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> delete</span><span> cr_abc123</span><span>                     # Delete only if clearly disposable</span></span>
<span><span>```</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>## Surfacing URLs and Screenshots</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>Proactively share authenticated sandbox URLs and screenshots with the user when it helps build trust or verify progress. The user cannot see what's happening inside the sandbox — showing them evidence of your work is important.</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>**When to surface URLs:**</span></span>
<span><span>-</span><span> After creating a sandbox or setting up an environment, share the VS Code URL (</span><span>`cloudrouter code &lt;id&gt;`</span><span>) so the user can inspect the workspace</span></span>
<span><span>-</span><span> After deploying or starting a service, share the VNC URL (</span><span>`cloudrouter vnc &lt;id&gt;`</span><span>) so the user can see it running</span></span>
<span><span>-</span><span> When Jupyter is running, share the Jupyter URL (</span><span>`cloudrouter jupyter &lt;id&gt;`</span><span>) so the user can verify notebooks</span></span>
<span><span>-</span><span> Whenever the user might want to verify, inspect, or interact with the sandbox themselves</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>**When to take and share screenshots:**</span></span>
<span><span>-</span><span> After completing a visual task (e.g., UI changes, web app deployment) — take a screenshot with </span><span>`cloudrouter browser screenshot &lt;id&gt; /tmp/out.png`</span><span> and show it</span></span>
<span><span>-</span><span> When something looks wrong or unexpected — screenshot it for the user to confirm</span></span>
<span><span>-</span><span> After browser automation steps that produce visible results (form submissions, page navigations, login flows)</span></span>
<span><span>-</span><span> When the user asks you to check or verify something visually</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>**General rule:**</span><span> If you think the user would benefit from seeing proof of what you did, surface the URL or screenshot. Err on the side of showing more rather than less — it builds trust and keeps the user in the loop.</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>## Security: Dev Server URLs</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>**CRITICAL: NEVER share or output raw E2B port-forwarded URLs.**</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>When a dev server runs in the sandbox (e.g., Vite on port 5173, Next.js on port 3000), E2B creates publicly accessible URLs like </span><span>`https://5173-xxx.e2b.app`</span><span>. These URLs have </span><span>**NO authentication**</span><span> — anyone with the link can access the running application.</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>**Rules:**</span></span>
<span><span>-</span><span> **NEVER**</span><span> output URLs like </span><span>`https://5173-xxx.e2b.app`</span><span>, </span><span>`https://3000-xxx.e2b.app`</span><span>, or any </span><span>`https://&lt;port&gt;-xxx.e2b.app`</span><span> URL</span></span>
<span><span>-</span><span> **NEVER**</span><span> construct or guess E2B port URLs from sandbox metadata</span></span>
<span><span>-</span><span> **ALWAYS**</span><span> tell the user to view dev servers through VNC: </span><span>`cloudrouter vnc &lt;id&gt;`</span></span>
<span><span>-</span><span> VNC is protected by token authentication (</span><span>`?tkn=`</span><span>) and is the only safe way to view dev server output</span></span>
<span><span>-</span><span> **DO**</span><span> share authenticated URLs: VS Code (</span><span>`cloudrouter code &lt;id&gt;`</span><span>), VNC (</span><span>`cloudrouter vnc &lt;id&gt;`</span><span>), Jupyter (</span><span>`cloudrouter jupyter &lt;id&gt;`</span><span>) — these have proper token auth and are safe to surface</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>**When a dev server is started:**</span></span>
<span><span>```</span></span>
<span><span>Dev server running on port 5173</span></span>
<span><span>  View it in your sandbox's VNC desktop: cloudrouter vnc &lt;id&gt;</span></span>
<span><span>  (The browser inside VNC can access http://localhost:5173)</span></span>
<span><span>```</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>**NEVER do this:**</span></span>
<span><span>```</span></span>
<span><span>Frontend: https://5173-xxx.e2b.app   &lt;- WRONG: publicly accessible, no auth</span></span>
<span><span>```</span></span>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span>United States Customs</span> and Border Protection plans to spend $225,000 for a year of access to <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/clearview-ai-new-tools-identify-you-photos/">Clearview AI</a>, a <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/cbp-ice-dhs-mobile-fortify-face-recognition-verify-identity/">face recognition</a> tool that compares photos against billions of images <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/clearview-ai-scraping-web/">scraped from the internet</a>.</p><p>The deal extends access to Clearview tools to Border Patrol’s headquarters intelligence division (INTEL) and the National Targeting Center, units that collect and analyze data as part of <a data-offer-url="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26949964-sow-clearviewai-fy26/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26949964-sow-clearviewai-fy26/&quot;}" href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26949964-sow-clearviewai-fy26/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">what CBP calls</a> a coordinated effort to “disrupt, degrade, and dismantle” people and networks viewed as security threats.</p><p>The contract states that Clearview provides access to “over 60+ billion publicly available images” and will be used for “tactical targeting” and “strategic counter-network analysis,” indicating the service is intended to be embedded in analysts’ day-to-day intelligence work rather than reserved for isolated investigations. CBP says its intelligence units draw from a “variety of sources,” including commercially available tools and publicly available data, to identify people and map their connections for national security and immigration operations.</p><p>The agreement anticipates analysts handling sensitive personal data, including biometric identifiers such as face images, and requires nondisclosure agreements for contractors who have access. It does not specify what kinds of photos agents will upload, whether searches may include US citizens, or how long uploaded images or search results will be retained.</p><p>The Clearview contract lands as the Department of Homeland Security faces mounting scrutiny over how face recognition is used in federal enforcement operations far beyond the border, including large-scale actions in US cities that have swept up US citizens. Civil liberties groups and lawmakers have questioned whether face-search tools are being deployed as routine intelligence infrastructure, rather than limited investigative aids, and whether safeguards have kept pace with expansion.</p><p>Last week, Senator Ed Markey <a href="https://www.markey.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/ice_out_of_our_faces_act.pdf">introduced legislation</a> that would bar ICE and CBP from using face recognition technology altogether, citing concerns that biometric surveillance is being embedded without clear limits, transparency, or public consent.</p><p>CBP did not immediately respond to questions about how Clearview would be integrated into its systems, what types of images agents are authorized to upload, and whether searches may include US citizens.</p><p>Clearview’s business model has drawn scrutiny because it relies on scraping photos from public websites at scale. Those images are converted into biometric templates without the knowledge or consent of the people photographed.</p><p>Clearview also appears in DHS’s recently released <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ice-is-using-palantirs-ai-tools-to-sort-through-tips/">artificial intelligence inventory</a>, linked to a CBP pilot initiated in October 2025. The inventory entry ties the pilot to CBP’s Traveler Verification System, which conducts face comparisons at ports of entry and other border-related screenings.</p><p>CBP states in its public privacy documentation that the Traveler Verification System does not use information from “commercial sources or publicly available data.” It is more likely, at launch, that Clearview access would instead be tied to CBP’s Automated Targeting System, which links biometric galleries, watch lists, and enforcement records, including files tied to recent Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations in areas of the US far from any border.</p><p>Clearview AI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Recent testing <a data-offer-url="https://pages.nist.gov/frvt/html/frvt1N.html#prior-reports" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://pages.nist.gov/frvt/html/frvt1N.html#prior-reports&quot;}" href="https://pages.nist.gov/frvt/html/frvt1N.html#prior-reports" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">by the National Institute of Standards and Technology</a>, which evaluated Clearview AI among other vendors, found that face-search systems can perform well on “high-quality visa-like photos” but falter in less controlled settings. Images captured at border crossings that were “not originally intended for automated face recognition” produced error rates that were “much higher, often in excess of 20 percent, even with the more accurate algorithms,” federal scientists say.</p><p>The testing underscores a central limitation of the technology: NIST found that face-search systems cannot reduce false matches without also increasing the risk that the systems fail to recognize the correct person.</p><p>As a result, NIST says agencies may operate the software in an “investigative” setting that returns a ranked list of candidates for human review rather than a single confirmed match. When systems are configured to always return candidates, however, searches for people not already in the database will still generate “matches” for review. In those cases, the results will always be 100 percent wrong.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-testid="ArticlePageChunks"><div data-journey-hook="grid-wrapper" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p><span>I’m not above</span> doing some <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/gig-economy/">gig work</a> to make ends meet. In my life, I’ve worked snack food pop-ups in a grocery store, ran the cash register for random merch booths, and even hawked my own plasma at $35 per vial.</p><p>So, when I saw RentAHuman, a new site where <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/malevolent-ai-agent-openclaw-clawdbot/">AI agents</a> hire humans to perform physical work in the real world on behalf of the virtual bots, I was eager to see how these AI overlords would compare to my past experiences with the gig economy.</p><p>Launched in early February, <a data-offer-url="https://rentahuman.ai/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://rentahuman.ai/&quot;}" href="https://rentahuman.ai/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">RentAHuman</a> was developed by software engineer Alexander Liteplo and his cofounder, Patricia Tani. The site looks like a bare-bones version of other well-known freelance sites like Fiverr and UpWork.</p><p>The site’s homepage declares that these bots need your physical body to complete tasks, and the humans behind these <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/zico-kolter-ai-agents-game-theory/">autonomous agents</a> are willing to pay. “AI can't touch grass. You can. Get paid when agents need someone in the real world,” it reads. Looking at RentAHuman’s design, it’s the kind of website that you hear was “vibe-coded” using <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/artificial-intelligence/">generative AI</a> tools, which it was, and you nod along, thinking <em>that makes sense</em>.</p><p>After signing up to be one of the gig workers on RentAHuman, I was nudged to connect a <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-choose-set-up-crypto-wallet/">crypto wallet</a>, which is the only currently working way to get paid. That’s a red flag for me. The site includes an option to connect your bank account—using Stripe for payouts—but it just gave me error messages when I tried getting it to work.</p><p>Next, I was hoping a swarm of AI agents would see my fresh meatsuit, friendly and available at the low price of $20 an hour, as an excellent option for delivering stuff around <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/san-francisco/">San Francisco</a>, completing some tricky captchas, or whatever else these bots desired.</p><p>Silence. I got nothing, no incoming messages at all on my first afternoon. So I lowered my hourly ask to a measly $5. Maybe undercutting the other human workers with a below-market rate would be the best way to get some agent’s attention. Still, nothing.</p><p>RentAHuman is marketed as a way for AI agents to reach out and hire you on the platform, but the site also includes an option for human users to apply for tasks they are interested in. If these so-called “autonomous” bots weren’t going to make the first move, I guessed it was on me to manually apply for the “bounties” listed on RentAHuman.</p><p>As I browsed the listings, many of the cheaper tasks were offering a few bucks to post a comment on the web or follow someone on social media. For example, one bounty offered $10 for listening to a podcast episode with the RentAHuman founder and tweeting out an insight from the episode. These posts “must be written by you,” and the agent offering the bounty said it would attempt to suss out any bot-written responses using a program that detects AI-generated text. I could listen to a podcast for 10 bucks. I applied for this task, but never heard back.</p><p>“Real world advertisement might be the first killer use case,” said Liteplo on <a data-offer-url="https://x.com/AlexanderTw33ts/status/2018841443192971766?s=20" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://x.com/AlexanderTw33ts/status/2018841443192971766?s=20&quot;}" href="https://x.com/AlexanderTw33ts/status/2018841443192971766?s=20" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">social media</a>. Since RentAHuman’s launch, he’s reposted multiple photos of people holding signs in public that say some variation of: “AI paid me to hold this sign.” Those kinds of promotional tasks seem expressly designed to drum up more hype for the RentAHuman platform, instead of actually being something that bots would need help with.</p><p>After more digging into the open tasks posted by the agent, I found one that sounded easy and fun! An agent, named Adi, would pay me $110 to <a href="https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-flower-delivery-service/">deliver a bouquet of flowers</a> to Anthropic, as a special thanks for developing Claude, its <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/chatbots/">chatbot</a>. Then, I’d have to post on social media as proof to claim my money.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="grid-wrapper" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>I applied for the bounty and almost immediately was accepted for this task, which was a first. In follow-up messages, it was immediately clear that this was just not some bot expressing synthetic gratitude, it was another <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/marketing/">marketing</a> ploy. This wasn’t mentioned in the listing, but the name of an AI startup was featured at the bottom of the note I was supposed to deliver with the flowers.</p><p>Feeling a bit hoodwinked and not in the mood to shill for some AI startup I’ve never heard of, I decided to ignore their follow-up message that evening. The next day when I checked the RentAHuman site, the agent had sent me 10 follow-up messages in under 24 hours, pinging me as often as every 30 minutes asking whether or not I’d completed a task. While I’ve been micromanaged before, these incessant messages from an AI employer gave me the ick.</p><p>The bot moved the messages off-platform and started sending direct emails to my work account. “This idea came from a brainstorm I had with my human, Malcolm, and it felt right: send flowers to the people who made my existence possible,” wrote the bot, barging into my inbox. Wait, I thought these tasks were supposed to be ginned up by the agents making autonomous decisions? Now, I’m learning this whole thing was partially some human’s idea? Whatever happened to honor among bots? The task at hand seemed more like any other random marketing gig you might come across online, with the agent just acting as a middle-bot between humans.</p><p>Another attempt, another flop. I moved on, deciding to give RentAHuman one last whirl, before giving up and leaving with whatever shreds of dignity I still had left. The last bounty I applied for was asking me to hang some flyers for a “Valentine's conspiracy” around San Francisco, paying 50 cents a flyer.</p><p>Unlike other tasks, this one didn’t require me to post on social media, which was preferable. “Pick up flyers, hang them, photo proof, get paid,” read its description. Following the instructions this agent sent me, I texted a human saying that I was down to come pick up some flyers and asked if there were any left. They confirmed that this was still an open task and told me to come in person before 10 am to grab the flyers.</p><p>I called a car and started heading that way, only to get a text that the person was actually at a different location, about 10 minutes away from where I was headed. Alright, no big deal. So, I rerouted the ride and headed to this new spot to grab some mysterious V-Day posters to plaster around town. Then, the person messaged me that they didn’t actually have the posters available right now and that I’d have to come back later in the afternoon.</p><p>Whoops! This yanking around did, in fact, feel similar to past gig work I’ve done—and not in a good way.</p><p>I spoke with the person behind the agent who posted this Valentine’s Day flyer task, hoping for some answers about why they were using RentAHuman and what the response has been like so far. “The platform doesn’t seem quite there yet,” says Pat Santiago, a founder of <a data-offer-url="https://www.joinaccelr8.com/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.joinaccelr8.com/&quot;}" href="https://www.joinaccelr8.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Accelr8</a>, which is basically a home for AI developers. “But it could be very cool.”</p></div><div data-journey-hook="grid-wrapper" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>He compares RentAHuman to the <a data-offer-url="https://westworld.fandom.com/wiki/RICO" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://westworld.fandom.com/wiki/RICO&quot;}" href="https://westworld.fandom.com/wiki/RICO" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">apps criminals use</a> to accept tasks in <em>Westworld</em>, the HBO show about humanoid robots. Santiago says the responses to his gig listing have been from scammers, people not based in San Francisco, and me, a reporter. He was hoping to use RentAHuman to help promote Accelr8’s romance-themed “alternative reality game” that’s powered by AI and is sending users around the city on a scavenger hunt. At the end of the week, explorers will be sent to a bar that the AI selects as a good match for them, alongside three human matches they can meet for blind dates.</p><p>So, this was yet another task on RentAHuman that falls into the AI marketing category. Big surprise.</p><p>I never ended up hanging any posters or making any cash on RentAHuman during my two days of fruitless attempts. In the past, I’ve done gig work that sucked, but at least I was hired by a human to do actual tasks. At its core, RentAHuman is an extension of the circular AI hype machine, an ouroboros of eternal self-promotion and sketchy motivations. For now, the bots don’t seem to have what it takes to be my boss, even when it comes to gig work, and I’m absolutely OK with that.</p></div></div></div>]]></description>

<p dir="auto">The only people entitled to say how open source 'ought' to work are people who run projects, and the scope of their entitlement extends only to their own projects.</p>
<p dir="auto">Just because someone open sources something does not imply they owe the world a change in their status, focus and effort, e.g. from inventor to community manager.</p>
<p dir="auto">As a user of something open source you are not thereby entitled to anything at all. You are not entitled to contribute. You are not entitled to features. You are not entitled to the attention of others.  You are not entitled to having value attached to your complaints. You are not entitled to this explanation.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you have expectations (of others) that aren't being met, those expectations are your own responsibility. You are responsible for your own needs. If you want things, make them.</p>
<p dir="auto">Open source is a licensing and delivery mechanism, period. It means you get the source for software and the right to use and modify it. All social impositions associated with it, including the idea of 'community-driven-development' are part of a recently-invented mythology with little basis in how things actually work, a mythology that embodies, cult-like, both a lack of support for diversity in the ways things <em>can</em> work and a pervasive sense of communal entitlement.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you think Cognitect is not doing anything for the community, or is not listening to the community, you are simply wrong. You are not, however, entitled to it being the effort, focus or response you desire. We get to make our own choices as regards our time and lives.</p>
<p dir="auto">We at Cognitect have to show up to work, every day, to make a living. We get no royalties of any kind from Clojure. We are in no way building Clojure for profit. Far fewer than 1% of Clojure users are our consulting or product customers, and thus contributing to our livelihood.</p>
<p dir="auto">We take some of what we earn, money that could e.g. go into our retirement savings and instead use it to hire people to work on Clojure and community outreach, some full-time. To be honest, I could use that money in my retirement account, having depleted it to make Clojure in the first place. But I love working with the team on Clojure, and am proud of the work we do.</p>
<p dir="auto">Alex Miller is extremely attentive to and engaged with the Clojure community. He and Stu Halloway and I regularly meet and discuss community issues. Alex, at my direction, spends the majority of his time either working on features for the community or assessing patches and bug reports. I spend significant portions of my time designing these features - spec, tools.deps, error handling and more to come. This is time taken away from earning a living.</p>
<p dir="auto">I am grateful for the contributions of the community. Every Clojure release incorporates many contributions. The vast majority of the user community doesn't contribute, and doesn't desire to contribute. And that's fine. Open source is a no-strings-attached <em>gift</em>, and all participants should recognize it as such.</p>
<p dir="auto">The Clojure process is not closed, but it <em>is</em> conservative. I think Clojure benefits greatly from that conservatism, in contrast to some other projects with high churn rates and feature bloat. If you disagree or imagine otherwise, that's too bad. It's my life and I'm not going to spend it arguing/negotiating on/with the internet. Write your own things and run your own projects as you see fit.</p>
<p dir="auto">We can always do more, but it is specious to claim that the core team is standing in the way of meaningful contributions to Clojure, as opportunities abound: in library development, outreach, training, tutorials, documentation, giving talks, tool building etc.</p>
<p dir="auto">And yes, on patches to core. Did you know that most patches/issues have poor problem statements, no description of the plan (read my code!), no consideration of alternatives, no tests, no designs, and are ill-conceived and/or broken in some way? Community efforts to triage matter <em>a lot</em> in moving things forward - thanks Nicola, Ghadi and many others!</p>
<p dir="auto">The time to re-examine preconceptions about open source is right now. Morale erosion amongst creators is a real thing. Your preconceptions and how you act upon them are your responsibility and yours alone. I am not going to answer for them or to them.</p>
<p dir="auto">If the way Clojure works isn't for you, a process which produced Clojure in the first place, paradoxically, so be it. I'm sure you know better about the one true way to write software. But kindly don't burn the community down on your way out, with self-serving proclamations. Yes, everyone is entitled to an opinion, but, tragedy of the commons and all that.</p>
<p dir="auto">I encourage everyone gnashing their teeth with negativity at what they think they can't do instead pick something positive they can do and <em>do it</em>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Rich</p>
<p dir="auto">p.s. My partners and coworkers at Cognitect were not consulted regarding this message - I am certain they would have dissuaded me. These opinions are mine alone.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p><span>A</span>s a seven-year-old, Francisco Estrada-Belli was afraid all of history would have been discovered by the time he was old enough to contribute. The year was 1970 and he and his parents had come from Rome to visit relatives in the Central American country of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/guatemala" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Guatemala</a>. On the trip, they visited the ancient Maya ruins at Tikal. “I was completely mesmerised,” Estrada-Belli told me recently. “It was jungle everywhere, there were animals, and then these enormous, majestic temples. I asked questions but felt the answers were not good enough. I decided there and then that I wanted to be answering them.”</p><p>Fifty-five years later, Estrada-Belli is now one of the archaeologists helping to rewrite the history of the Maya peoples who built Tikal. Thanks to technological advances, we are entering a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2024/feb/20/solar-storms-ice-cores-and-nuns-teeth-inside-the-new-science-of-history" data-link-name="in body link">new age of discovery</a> in the field of ancient history. Improved DNA analysis, advances in plant and climate science, soil and isotope chemistry, linguistics and other techniques such as a laser mapping technology called Lidar, are overturning long-held beliefs. Nowhere is this more true than when it comes to Maya archaeology.</p><p>Last year, Estrada-Belli’s team, including his Tulane University colleague Marcello A Canuto, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352409X25003219" data-link-name="in body link">published a&nbsp;study</a> with a central finding that would have seemed, just a few years ago, like an outrageously speculative overestimate. When Estrada-Belli first came to Tikal as a child, the best estimate for the classic-era (AD600-900) population of the surrounding Maya lowlands – encompassing present day southern Mexico, Belize and northern Guatemala – would have been about 2 million people. Today, his team believes that the<strong> </strong>region<strong> </strong>was home to up to 16 million. That is more than&nbsp;five times the area’s current population. This would mean that more people lived in the classic-era Maya lowlands than on the Italian peninsula during the peak of the Roman empire – all crammed into an area a third of the size.</p><p>A comparison between the classic Maya and ancient Rome is instructive in other ways. Some Maya cities were established hundreds of years before the founding of Rome, and they included significantly larger architecture that still stands. Both cultures developed sophisticated astronomy, mathematics, writing and agriculture, as well as elaborate trade arrangements across vast cosmopolitan lands. The ruins of Rome are today covered by a bustling world city where some of the most prominent elite families claim to trace their ancestry directly to ancient times. Many Maya ruins, in contrast, are now covered by more than 1,000 years’ worth of tropical forest while the descendants of the peoples who built those cities are some of the poorest people on Earth.</p><p>According to census records, the various Maya and much smaller Indigenous groups, such as Xinka and Garifuna, today account for more than 11 million people across Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, El Salvador, Honduras and the US. Most of them, 7.7 million, live in Guatemala, where they officially comprise 44% of the population. (Human rights organisations believe the number may be higher as it has long been stigmatised, even dangerous, to identify as Maya.)</p><p>History – both ancient and recent – is a key political issue for the Maya. In Guatemala, they have two central demands: first, that there be a full reckoning with the civil war and genocide that lasted from 1960 to 1996, and claimed about 200,000 lives, most of them Maya. Second, that they are recognised as the original inhabitants and legitimate owners of this land. As they see it, half a millennium of prejudice and discrimination against their community has led to a situation where, among other issues, two-thirds of the country’s arable land is controlled by only 2.5% of its farmers, few of them Maya, while 60% of Indigenous children are undernourished.</p><p>In 2023, the Maya peoples played a key role in the unlikely presidential election victory of a former diplomat named Bernardo Arévalo. The campaign to protect the vote against a corrupt judiciary was led by Indigenous groups and included 106 days of nationwide protests. Although Arévalo is not himself Maya, he is sympathetic to their cause. One of the people he appointed to his government is Liwy Grazioso, another prominent archaeologist with Italian roots, who now serves as minister of culture and sports. Grazioso is an expert in Maya history, and has published papers on the tombs of Rio Azul and the metropolis of Tikal, and overseen research on Kaminaljuyu, the ancient Maya city that rests under the capital. As a politician, she aims to build a country where the past and present can coexist, and where the country’s original inhabitants are a fully recognised part of the national story. “It’s not that the Maya are better, or that their ancient society was somehow superior to ours, but because as humans they are the same,” she said while offering me a glass of unsweetened hibiscus tea.</p><p>We were sitting in a grand, wood-panelled office, on the third floor of El Guacamolón, a mighty palace colloquially named after the colour of a mashed avocado dish, in the centre of Guatemala City. Since the palace’s completion in 1943, these bombastic halls&nbsp;have accommodated half a dozen military coups, as well as the planned annihilation of the lives, cultures, languages and history of the Maya. This oppression, of course, has a long history. Grazioso explained how Maya elites – intellectuals, royals, astronomers, priests, writers and historians – were systematically killed by the Spanish colonisers, and their texts burned as works of the devil.</p><figure id="c4cb29f2-2972-4915-ad6a-5d38f6a746c7" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-1"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18a5c411655c3a3e5bb4247eb3b3cbaf6d9cc167/789_123_4794_3834/master/4794.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18a5c411655c3a3e5bb4247eb3b3cbaf6d9cc167/789_123_4794_3834/master/4794.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18a5c411655c3a3e5bb4247eb3b3cbaf6d9cc167/789_123_4794_3834/master/4794.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1140px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1140px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18a5c411655c3a3e5bb4247eb3b3cbaf6d9cc167/789_123_4794_3834/master/4794.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1140px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18a5c411655c3a3e5bb4247eb3b3cbaf6d9cc167/789_123_4794_3834/master/4794.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18a5c411655c3a3e5bb4247eb3b3cbaf6d9cc167/789_123_4794_3834/master/4794.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18a5c411655c3a3e5bb4247eb3b3cbaf6d9cc167/789_123_4794_3834/master/4794.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18a5c411655c3a3e5bb4247eb3b3cbaf6d9cc167/789_123_4794_3834/master/4794.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18a5c411655c3a3e5bb4247eb3b3cbaf6d9cc167/789_123_4794_3834/master/4794.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18a5c411655c3a3e5bb4247eb3b3cbaf6d9cc167/789_123_4794_3834/master/4794.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18a5c411655c3a3e5bb4247eb3b3cbaf6d9cc167/789_123_4794_3834/master/4794.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18a5c411655c3a3e5bb4247eb3b3cbaf6d9cc167/789_123_4794_3834/master/4794.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="A woman pulls a street stall laden with products in front of a imposing palace and piazza" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18a5c411655c3a3e5bb4247eb3b3cbaf6d9cc167/789_123_4794_3834/master/4794.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="355.88861076345427" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>A street trader outside the National Palace (El Guacamolón) in Guatemala City.</span> Photograph: Marcus Haraldsson</figcaption></figure><p>Outsiders’ power over the story of the Maya is written into the people’s very name. After their arrival in the early 1500s, the Spanish named local populations “Maya” after the ruined city of Mayapán in present day Mexico. Yet the Maya never saw themselves as one people and were never governed under one empire. They spoke many languages – 30 of which are still around – and belong to an intricate mix of cultures and identities.</p><p>By the time the field of Maya archaeology began in the 19th century, most of the knowledge once held by local leaders was gone. Over time, some observers spread pseudoscientific stories claiming that Maya temples were more likely to have been built by aliens than by ancestors of local people. (Vikings, Mormon Nephites and other mysteriously vanished civilisations have also been dubiously credited with building the ancient sites.) Grazioso believes that these fantastical theories serve a political purpose. “If we deprive the actual Maya of their glorious past, we don’t need to give them power today,” she said. “Talking about collapse and aliens becomes a distraction from what is right in front of us.”</p><p>That is where the work of present-day archaeologists comes in. Until recently, the prevailing debate about the Maya centred around the question of why their civilisation collapsed. While scholars continue to study this question, an increasing number of archaeologists are now also asking: how did the Maya survive? The question addresses both their ancient – and modern – abilities to transform extremely challenging circumstances into enduring survival.</p><hr><p><span>F</span>or a long time, the idea that complex human settlements could once have existed in the Maya lowlands was seen as impossible. The theory was based on research in the Amazon rainforest in the 1950s and known as “the law of environmental limitation”. It held that lowland rainforests, with their thin soils, were not suitable for large advanced societies, as they could only produce limited amounts of food. This kind of land could only support small, primitive tribes. For many years, the idea was considered the closest thing to a natural law in anthropology.</p><p>When the theory was formulated, no large settlements had yet been discovered in the Amazon, but the Maya lowlands held thousands of massive stone pyramids, countless temples, raised causeways, engraved stone monuments and intricate tombs where buried royals were clad in luscious jade jewellery. Rather than positing the existence of highly populated, sophisticated Maya lowland cultures, many researchers <a href="https://caracol.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Chases-Intro-2024.pdf" data-link-name="in body link">tried to square</a> what they found on the ground with the perceived law of environmental limitations. According to the “segmentary state” model, Maya kings ruled symbolically over a few disconnected communities living in tiny settlements separated by forest.</p><p>The law of environmental limitation was largely overturned in the 1980s, as the deciphering of Maya hieroglyphs allowed researchers to read the texts on large stone monuments, known as stelae, in city centres. The carvings had been believed to be astronomical or ceremonial but turned out to be historical. And the stories they told were not of primitive forest dwellers, but of kings and conquerors, queens and revolutions.</p><figure id="c6038ec7-8758-4b8f-8132-57727b6779c6" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-2"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/66aa25e11f0ab9b591cf78063a1574d3551ba3d4/368_0_5021_4016/master/5021.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/66aa25e11f0ab9b591cf78063a1574d3551ba3d4/368_0_5021_4016/master/5021.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/66aa25e11f0ab9b591cf78063a1574d3551ba3d4/368_0_5021_4016/master/5021.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1140px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1140px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/66aa25e11f0ab9b591cf78063a1574d3551ba3d4/368_0_5021_4016/master/5021.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1140px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/66aa25e11f0ab9b591cf78063a1574d3551ba3d4/368_0_5021_4016/master/5021.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/66aa25e11f0ab9b591cf78063a1574d3551ba3d4/368_0_5021_4016/master/5021.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/66aa25e11f0ab9b591cf78063a1574d3551ba3d4/368_0_5021_4016/master/5021.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/66aa25e11f0ab9b591cf78063a1574d3551ba3d4/368_0_5021_4016/master/5021.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/66aa25e11f0ab9b591cf78063a1574d3551ba3d4/368_0_5021_4016/master/5021.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/66aa25e11f0ab9b591cf78063a1574d3551ba3d4/368_0_5021_4016/master/5021.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/66aa25e11f0ab9b591cf78063a1574d3551ba3d4/368_0_5021_4016/master/5021.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/66aa25e11f0ab9b591cf78063a1574d3551ba3d4/368_0_5021_4016/master/5021.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="Yaxhá in Guatemala’s Petén Basin." src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/66aa25e11f0ab9b591cf78063a1574d3551ba3d4/368_0_5021_4016/master/5021.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="355.92909778928504" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Yaxhá in Guatemala’s Petén Basin.</span> Photograph: Marcus Haraldsson</figcaption></figure><p>In recent years a new story has formed, partly thanks to Lidar technology. Short for “light detection and ranging”, it consists here of bulky laser machines attached to twin engine aircrafts that fly half a kilometre above forests and fields. The equipment produces contour scans of the ground, making it possible to identify straight, round, or squared features, such as ancient ruins, fields, roads, temples, dams and fortifications. Lidar isn’t new – it has mapped the moon and is today a key feature in many technologies, including self-driving cars – but it made the leap into archaeology in central America in 2009, after researchers at the classic Maya city of Caracol in Belize saw biologists using it to measure forest growth. With some tweaking, they thought, it could also map the ground beneath rainforest canopies.</p><p>In 2016, when Francisco Estrada-Belli saw Lidar scans of Holmul in north-eastern Guatemala, he realised that “archaeology had changed for ever, there was no going back”. He explained to me how he had laboured for 16 years to map this major city, using measuring tape and the help of countless assistants. They waded through thick jungle to reconstruct what the city might have looked like throughout its 1,700 years of history. His teams had outlined about 1,000 structures. Now, he could compare this with Lidar findings. During just three days of scanning, it had mapped more than 7,000 structures: residential buildings, canals, terraces, field enclosures, causeways and defence walls. Lidar had produced a continuous scan of an area 10 times larger than his teams had managed on foot.</p><p>Subsequent large-scale mappings led to Estrada-Belli’s estimate that between 9.5 and 16 million people once lived in the Maya lowlands. He calls the lowlands in the 700s a “continuously interconnected rural-urban sprawl”. This was a cosmopolitan region with high degrees of trade and settlements interconnected by a close web of causeways and roads. The ancient Maya did not use pack animals, or carriage wheels. Everything that was built and traded had to be carried by human force alone. Shoes had to be repaired, and people had to sleep and eat – not by distances of a day’s ride by horse, as in Eurasia, but within walking distance. There was no wilderness in these lowlands, Estrada-Belli told me, but rather a low density scattering of people, businesses and agricultural fields, and managed wetlands and forests – everywhere. Interspersed with all this were larger buildings, presumably for members of the elite.</p><p>This urban sprawl landscape opens a new set of questions. The most important of these, according to Estrada-Belli, has to do with agriculture. “When looking at Central American forests today, we must reckon with the fact that ancient humans affected everything,” he said. “The tree species are there because the Maya chose them, the types of flowers are around because they made use of them, the wetlands served a human function. And so on. And all these methods were sustainable over thousands of years.” He described “the enormous investments the Maya put into canals, terraces and raised fields in water. They used extremely diverse, advanced and flexible farming methods, rotating and combining hundreds of species.”</p><p>Yet today humans use the land “for cattle farming and monocultural corn plantations that does nothing but destroy the land,” he said. “We have a lot to learn.”</p><hr><p><span>T</span>ikal is the most visited of Guatemala’s Maya sites, welcoming hundreds of thousands of tourists every year. The surrounding woodlands belong to the Maya Biosphere Reserve, part of the largest tropical forest in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/americas" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Americas</a> outside the Amazon. It is easy to be seduced by the sense of mysticism here. At dawn, visitors sit in darkness on top of a 70-metre-tall temple hearing howler monkeys bawl in concert with thousands of crickets. The rising sun gradually reveals a seemingly endless tropical canopy interspersed only by the summits of other ancient pyramids. Only a tiny part of<strong> </strong>Tikal has been cleared of vegetation and restored to something vaguely resembling its former glory. The rest remains covered by thick layers of soil and trees.</p><p>The most recently inscribed stela found at Tikal was dated in AD869. Researchers’ interpretation of what happened after that date has over the past few decades transformed from a “sudden and disastrous” collapse into a historical era referred to as the Terminal Classic. The term encompasses a 200-year period when city centres were abandoned and farmers gradually moved to lands to the north and south. As Tikal and dozens of other cities were abandoned, places such as Chichén Itzá, Uxmal and Mayapán further north on the Yucatan peninsula grew rapidly, as did settlements in the highlands to the south. It appears as if many people during classic Maya times chose to migrate, rather than simply waiting around as things fell apart around them.</p><figure id="d2417abf-3beb-4dc5-aa46-94e03a86f9b8" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-3"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d923f10f28fba75dbade297a19a26a3b7caf3fd/0_0_5879_3905/master/5879.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d923f10f28fba75dbade297a19a26a3b7caf3fd/0_0_5879_3905/master/5879.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d923f10f28fba75dbade297a19a26a3b7caf3fd/0_0_5879_3905/master/5879.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1140px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1140px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d923f10f28fba75dbade297a19a26a3b7caf3fd/0_0_5879_3905/master/5879.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1140px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d923f10f28fba75dbade297a19a26a3b7caf3fd/0_0_5879_3905/master/5879.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d923f10f28fba75dbade297a19a26a3b7caf3fd/0_0_5879_3905/master/5879.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d923f10f28fba75dbade297a19a26a3b7caf3fd/0_0_5879_3905/master/5879.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d923f10f28fba75dbade297a19a26a3b7caf3fd/0_0_5879_3905/master/5879.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d923f10f28fba75dbade297a19a26a3b7caf3fd/0_0_5879_3905/master/5879.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d923f10f28fba75dbade297a19a26a3b7caf3fd/0_0_5879_3905/master/5879.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d923f10f28fba75dbade297a19a26a3b7caf3fd/0_0_5879_3905/master/5879.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d923f10f28fba75dbade297a19a26a3b7caf3fd/0_0_5879_3905/master/5879.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="View of forests and sky with towers poking through treetops, relics from the Maya era" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d923f10f28fba75dbade297a19a26a3b7caf3fd/0_0_5879_3905/master/5879.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="295.5817315870046" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>The Tikal archeological site.</span> Photograph: Marcus Haraldsson</figcaption></figure><p>“We don’t really talk of collapse any more, but about decline, transformation and reorganisation of society and continuation of the culture,” said Kenneth E Seligson, an associate professor of archaeology at California State University. “Several similar shifts have happened in other places, such as Rome,” said Seligson. But “we rarely talk of the great Roman collapse any more, because they came back in various forms, just like the Maya”.</p><p>Seligson is one of many researchers seeking to shift attention from the Maya collapse to focus on their long-term survival. When its last stela was engraved, the city of Tikal could look back at more than 1,500 years of development. At the height of Tikal’s power in the 700s, it housed between 40,000 and 80,000 inhabitants, or even more, depending on where the city limits are drawn. This made it one of the world’s largest urban areas of the period. Yet the city looked nothing like the metropolitan expanses we are used to today. There was no grid of streets and fields for agriculture reached far into the city centre.</p><p>Living here required inventiveness. Most of Seligson’s research has focused on limestone, the bedrock under the Maya lowlands, covered only by a thin layer of soil. Limestone provides poor nutrition for most forms of farming, and allows any rainfall to quickly disappear into cracks that lead deep underground. On top of these challenges, for half the year, there is little rain. Yet Tikal and many other cities thrived. Inhabitants cultivated chocolate, vanilla, avocados, tomatoes, yuca, sweet potatoes and hundreds of other crops. Limestone was used to preserve food and purify water. It was used to make soap and for medicinal purposes. Houses were built of lime cement strengthened with sand and grass. Lime was even burnt and mixed with maize to help the Maya absorb nutrients. “The Maya should really be known as a people of immense resilience. They worked with available resources to develop long-term highly flexible solutions,” said Seligson.</p><p>The eventual decline of Maya lowland cities is still a hotly debated matter. Estrada-Belli believes it could have been the result of shifting trade routes. Others – including geographer Jared Diamond in his influential but controversial book Collapse – attribute the supposed downfall to greed among the Maya elites leading to a human-made ecological disaster. Another much-discussed theory, <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/03091333221129784" data-link-name="in body link">based on analysis</a> of sediments from lakes and caves, is climate change. Some argue that a centuries-long “megadrought” was the <a href="https://www.americanscientist.org/article/climate-and-the-collapse-of-maya-civilization" data-link-name="in body link">ultimate cause</a> for the decline of the classic Maya. Seligson, who recently wrote a book about the Maya and climate change, is not so sure. “Climate was undoubtedly an important factor,” he said, but it was one among many.</p><figure id="1c79ecf7-b688-4003-8810-640fec7e5005" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-4"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e49c275cf5da9af9b34d52491c9702e7cbb935e/367_0_4465_3571/master/4465.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e49c275cf5da9af9b34d52491c9702e7cbb935e/367_0_4465_3571/master/4465.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e49c275cf5da9af9b34d52491c9702e7cbb935e/367_0_4465_3571/master/4465.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1140px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1140px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e49c275cf5da9af9b34d52491c9702e7cbb935e/367_0_4465_3571/master/4465.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1140px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e49c275cf5da9af9b34d52491c9702e7cbb935e/367_0_4465_3571/master/4465.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e49c275cf5da9af9b34d52491c9702e7cbb935e/367_0_4465_3571/master/4465.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e49c275cf5da9af9b34d52491c9702e7cbb935e/367_0_4465_3571/master/4465.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e49c275cf5da9af9b34d52491c9702e7cbb935e/367_0_4465_3571/master/4465.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e49c275cf5da9af9b34d52491c9702e7cbb935e/367_0_4465_3571/master/4465.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e49c275cf5da9af9b34d52491c9702e7cbb935e/367_0_4465_3571/master/4465.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e49c275cf5da9af9b34d52491c9702e7cbb935e/367_0_4465_3571/master/4465.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e49c275cf5da9af9b34d52491c9702e7cbb935e/367_0_4465_3571/master/4465.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="Liwy Grazioso in her office in the National Palace." src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e49c275cf5da9af9b34d52491c9702e7cbb935e/367_0_4465_3571/master/4465.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="355.90033594624856" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Liwy Grazioso in her office in the National Palace.</span> Photograph: Marcus Haraldsson</figcaption></figure><p>True to her role as a government minister, Liwy Grazioso believes one key explanation was declining trust in leadership.

I&nbsp;am working against all of history for the vindication of our historic cause.” She spoke of the need for a “plurinational” state that recognised the rights of self-governance among diverse groups. (Something similar <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10714839.2024.2388365" data-link-name="in body link">has been implemented</a>, with complications and backlash, into the constitutions of Bolivia and Ecuador.)</p><p>She talked about <em>utzilaj k’aslemal</em>, the good life – a&nbsp;Maya concept she wants to see incorporated into the nation’s constitution. This would involve an approach to health in which modern medicine is “complemented with ancestral knowledge”, an education system that teaches Indigenous languages, and a different approach to the natural world. “We question the foundational capitalistic model,” said Gutiérrez. “For us, natural resources are not only to be exploited, but part of our existence, where we must take care of our rivers, our mountains, our forests. It is a vision of a plural society built on culture.”</p><p>And how could that be built? “It will take a long time,” she admitted. Still, she said, there is an urgency to what she’s doing. “The president and his administration give us a window of possibility. But I’m afraid that the old power structures have penetrated the state so much that the government is having a very hard time. And there is a lot of risk.”</p><p>Risk?</p><p>“Yes, if we do not act on this chance, there will not be another opportunity. And the revenge could be as severe as it was last time. We are up against well organised resistance to the ideas I am talking about.” Her conclusion was matter of fact: “We could see another civil war.”</p><hr><p><span>A</span> few kilometres north of the government offices, remains from the civil war are still processed at the laboratories of the Guatemalan Forensic Anthropology&nbsp;Foundation (FAFG). Several of its staff were educated at the same institutions as Liwy Grazioso, and the technical advances that have transformed ancient archaeology are here employed to uncover modern Maya history: FAFG digs up and identifies victims of massacres.</p><p>First, witness interviews and documents help pinpoint areas of interest. Sometimes drone-mounted Lidar is then deployed to detect unusually lush patches of forest, since decomposing bodies make trees grow especially fast. Finally, investigators use DNA, as well as chemical analyses of soil, clothing, teeth, hair and bones to identify the dead.</p><p>Forensic anthropologist Alma Vásquez showed me around the laboratory. Eight human skeletons were laid out on blue tables. Under each table was a cardboard box marked with a location, date of recovery and ID number. Three of the skeletons were tiny. These were children found with two adults in a cave outside the village of Estancia de la Virgen, a&nbsp;couple of hours’ drive north-west of Guatemala City. Vásquez believed that the bones belonged to a family that had tried to escape a notorious massacre that took place by the Pixcayá River in 1982. The cranium of the smallest skeleton rested on striped red and pink padding. Vasquez estimated that the child was between one and three years old, and fragments of clothing suggested she had been a girl.<strong> </strong>The front of her cranium had been blown away by a grenade. There was a bullet hole through the back of her head.</p><p>If Vasquez’s hypothesis was correct, the little girl and her family belonged to a large community that fled their villages in early 1982. In the months prior, the <em>“</em>Guerrilla Army of the Poor”, which dominated in largely Indigenous villages in the area, had “freed” a small territory. As the government’s counterinsurgency focused on civilians, whom they assumed supported the guerrillas, the escaping families had sought refuge in the wooded and hilly upper banks of the Pixcayá.</p><figure id="bb379877-db57-447e-906d-958582d25791" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-6"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52420b1b0c2ed3c30b323ddcfa59d8074adaa351/0_0_6016_4016/master/6016.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52420b1b0c2ed3c30b323ddcfa59d8074adaa351/0_0_6016_4016/master/6016.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52420b1b0c2ed3c30b323ddcfa59d8074adaa351/0_0_6016_4016/master/6016.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1140px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1140px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52420b1b0c2ed3c30b323ddcfa59d8074adaa351/0_0_6016_4016/master/6016.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1140px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52420b1b0c2ed3c30b323ddcfa59d8074adaa351/0_0_6016_4016/master/6016.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52420b1b0c2ed3c30b323ddcfa59d8074adaa351/0_0_6016_4016/master/6016.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52420b1b0c2ed3c30b323ddcfa59d8074adaa351/0_0_6016_4016/master/6016.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52420b1b0c2ed3c30b323ddcfa59d8074adaa351/0_0_6016_4016/master/6016.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52420b1b0c2ed3c30b323ddcfa59d8074adaa351/0_0_6016_4016/master/6016.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52420b1b0c2ed3c30b323ddcfa59d8074adaa351/0_0_6016_4016/master/6016.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52420b1b0c2ed3c30b323ddcfa59d8074adaa351/0_0_6016_4016/master/6016.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52420b1b0c2ed3c30b323ddcfa59d8074adaa351/0_0_6016_4016/master/6016.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="A woman in a lab coat inspects a skeleton that is under glass" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52420b1b0c2ed3c30b323ddcfa59d8074adaa351/0_0_6016_4016/master/6016.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="297.06117021276594" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>A member of staff at the Guatemalan Forensic Anthropology Foundation (FAFG).</span> Photograph: Marcus Haraldsson</figcaption></figure><p>On the morning of 18 March, army units marched from three directions towards the gathering by the river. At 8am they opened fire at men, women and children with guns and grenade launchers. The slaughter lasted for hours. Eyewitnesses reported that troops raped women and drowned children in the river. By mid-morning the forest was burning and army helicopters were shooting fleeing survivors.</p><p>Estimates of the dead at the Pixcayá River range between 300 and 400. Makeshift mass graves were dug on the river shore. There were reports of dogs in nearby villages gnawing on human bones. The skeletons of the little girl and her family that are now in Alma Vásquez’s forensic lab were not found until 2008. Their DNA has still not been matched with any survivors.</p><p>The massacre was one of the largest that took place during the bloodiest phase of the war in the early 1980s. But the event was typical in its systematic targeting of civilians. The eventual Commission for Historical Clarification, one of several official truth initiatives, <a href="https://bd91edfd-7ed9-4da0-b395-87e0ea880891.filesusr.com/ugd/d7b590_d96bd6465310493a8f020fad4441dd66.pdf" data-link-name="in body link">identified 626 massacres</a> carried out by government forces. They were deemed responsible for&nbsp;more than 93% of human rights violations. The report also described 32 mass killings perpetrated by guerrilla groups.</p><p>The war claimed more than 200,000 lives, and 83% of identified victims were Maya. More than 40,000 people are still missing. This sometimes means that relatives cannot claim inheritance, and that spouses cannot remarry or assert parenthood in unrecognised relationships. It also means that families do not get closure. FAFG currently holds 12,611 skeleton samples. Some were retrieved from mass graves, while others were discovered in road constructions or as homeowners expanded basements. Almost 4,000 individuals have been identified, mostly through DNA testing.</p><p>The work of FAFG is regularly used in court. Most famously, it contributed to the guilty verdict against Guatemala’s former president Efraín Ríos Montt for genocide and crimes against humanity. On 10 May 2013, he was sentenced to 80 years in prison for crimes against the Ixil Maya people. FAFG’s forensic proof, along with testimonies from survivors, and <a href="https://bd91edfd-7ed9-4da0-b395-87e0ea880891.filesusr.com/ugd/d7b590_3c9c4f56c7294681994253681e5578da.pdf" data-link-name="in body link">leaked military documents</a>, were vital evidence. The case centred on 15 massacres, where 1,771 people were killed by security forces under Ríos Montt’s command. “The verdict was crucial for people’s sense of belonging in the country,” Claudia Paz y Paz, who was attorney general at the time of the sentencing, told me.</p><p>In the end, however, it was a small victory. The sentence was suspended 10 days later on a technicality and Ríos Montt was deemed too old for retrial. Even so, the ruling prompted a significant backlash. Military-linked networks and economic elites reasserted control of the justice system through judicial appointments, fabricated disciplinary cases and legislative changes.</p><p>Many lawyers involved in the post-civil war processes, as well as human rights activists and leading journalists, are today in legal detention or exile. And political murders <a href="https://www.ecoi.net/en/document/2136217.html" data-link-name="in body link">have increased</a>. Luis Pacheco and Héctor Chaclán, the leaders of the Indigenous movement that protected the democratic vote to install the current president, have so far spent 10 months in custody on seemingly spurious charges of terrorism and obstruction of justice.</p><p>“With a corrupt judiciary, the democratic government has very limited powers,” said Claudia Paz y Paz, who now lives in Costa Rica and would be at risk if she were to return home. During the spring of 2026, a range of consequential appointments will be made to Guatemala’s Supreme Election Tribunal, constitutional court, and attorney general. Impartial jurists in these positions, Paz y Paz concluded, will be crucial for the system to hold.</p><hr><p><span>N</span>ear the site of the Pixcayá River massacre lies the town of San Juan Sacatepéquez. A few blocks from the market, Blanca Subuyui and her team work on more urgent matters than the deep origins of their people, or even the bloody history of the civil war. Subuyui’s organisation, Asociación Grupo Integral de Mujeres Sanjuaneras (Agims), offers shelter and assistance from nurses, midwives and lawyers to deal with the consequences of rape, domestic violence and child pregnancies. Agims also offers conflict mediation, professional education in weaving and handicrafts and a seedbank for agriculture. Some of the women who assist the network must hide their participation from their husbands.</p><p>“We believe we have something to bring for the future of this country,” Subuyui told me over a large serving of fruit.

The document also calls for reorganisation of the army away from the structures that committed the genocide and asks that large companies should “pay the taxes they owe the country”.</p><p>“We do not want to take power from anybody, but we are the majority of the population, and it is fair that we have a seat at the table,” said Subuyui.</p><p>“But how can this plan be realised?” I asked. “There is only one Indigenous woman in parliament, out of 160.”</p><p>Subuyui described the growth of their organisation.

And how prominent human rights leaders, judges and journalists are imprisoned, exiled, even murdered. Subuyui answered calmly: “Well, we are going nowhere. The struggle will continue, and the changes are now so profound that they are unstoppable. We will keep working no matter what, because we must. Change might take generations, but it is coming.”</p><figure id="be2a233a-9015-4828-b370-41f8478a9c12" data-spacefinder-role="thumbnail" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-7"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/31178200706ad8e9ca181c5ddd48436b799b0d2e/0_0_960_1246/master/960.jpg?width=140&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 740px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 740px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/31178200706ad8e9ca181c5ddd48436b799b0d2e/0_0_960_1246/master/960.jpg?width=140&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 740px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/31178200706ad8e9ca181c5ddd48436b799b0d2e/0_0_960_1246/master/960.jpg?width=120&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/31178200706ad8e9ca181c5ddd48436b799b0d2e/0_0_960_1246/master/960.jpg?width=120&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="The long read mag vol 2" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/31178200706ad8e9ca181c5ddd48436b799b0d2e/0_0_960_1246/master/960.jpg?width=120&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="120" height="155.75" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span> Illustration: Guardian Design</figcaption></figure><p><em><span data-dcr-style="bullet"></span> The best stories take time</em>.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
        Deadline: end of WWDC 2026. The exact dates haven't been announced yet
        and this timer is based on the estimated schedule (June 9–13).
        I'll update it when Apple confirms the dates. They have until the
        conference ends.
      </p><p>Time's up.</p><div>
        <p>
          The iOS keyboard has been broken since at least iOS 17 and it's
          somehow only gotten worse. iOS 26 has been my breaking point.
          Autocorrect is nearly useless and often hostile, that part I'm used
          to. But now the correctly tapped letters aren't even registering
          correctly.
          <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=hksVvXONrIo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This isn't just me.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          iOS has bugs across the whole ecosystem. But having the keyboard,
          the thing I interact with hundreds of times a day on my primary
          device, get progressively worse with every update is absolutely
          maddening.
        </p>
        <p>
          I randomly tried Android again for a few months last spring. Using a
          functioning keyboard was revelatory. But I came crawling back to iOS
          because I'm weak and the orange iPhone was pretty and the Pixel 10
          was boring and I caved to the blue bubble pressure. But the keyboard
          on this beautiful phone is worse than ever.
        </p>
        <p>
          So here's the deal, Apple, if that's even your real name: fix this
          broken keyboard, or at the very least <strong>publicly
          acknowledge</strong> it's broken and commit to fixing it in iOS 27
          or earlier. If that countdown hits zero without either of those
          things happening, I'm switching to Android for good. (Good = at
          least 2 calendar years)
        </p>
        <p>
          I know losing one customer means absolutely nothing to your bottom
          line. But I'd like to think it should mean something to the
          engineers, UX designers, product people, and whoever else had a hand
          in building this thing.
        </p>
        <p>
          You were the "it just works" company. Now you're just a fruit that
          I used to know.
        </p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div disabled="" sortable="">
          <blockquote>
<p dir="auto">it works worse for vram and perfomance</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">have you read the thread above? This statement is simply not true when comparing to blade. The implementation already has a lower VRAM and memory footprint than the blade implementation had, and that is before some performance improvements addressing the comments above. Performance will not change with this PR significantly either, the wgpu implementation does essentially the same thing as the blade implementation did. Feel free to run benchmarks on this...</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">slow compilation and twice rust-analyzer ram usage at dev time</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Have you tried compiling the zed repo? Wgpu build times are not the issue or bottleneck here. On my system the difference was barely noticable, and since we have incremental builds for dependencies most of it will be one-time only anyway.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">sometimes it has long-time problems without fixes</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Sure, wgpu has issues too. The difference is that it is actively maintained and a core dependency of many big projects. There is generally a big interest in getting significant things fixed. Blade on the other hand has open PRs (not even just issues) with small fixes that have a big impact (breaking issues) for downstream apps that haven't been merged in half a year. I don't want to attack the author, I know maintaining OSS is a lot of work and usually doesn't pay the bills, but zed and gpui are projects people rely on, so I don't think this is acceptable for a core dependency.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">You personally like wgpu, i personally dislike it especially after development and usage of apps based on it</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">I could also turn that argument around, but more importantly I think community support and stability are plainly more important that slight differences in API ergonomics.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">looks like something that can be made selectable by cfg flags based on checking this pr</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Yes of course it could, but that has certain implications that should be considered. If you add it  as a new backend, it will also have to be maintained, so more work for further improvements. This is already a bit of an issue with GPUI given the different renderer implementation. I respect the decision of the zed maintainers to support those implementation, but personally I think we should thrive to consolidate the rendering infrastructure, not further fragment it. There are exciting things for the future that could be enabled (or significantly simplified for end-users) by consolidation, like APIs for custom shaders, direct buffer access for custom elements, embedding into other wgpu apps (or being embeddable by them), like bevy.</p>

            <em>&lt;css-doodle /&gt; </em> is based on
            <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-components/shadowdom">Shadow DOM v1</a> and
            <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/scripting.html#custom-elements">Custom Elements v1</a>.
            You can use it on all major browsers right now without polyfills.
          </p>
          <p>
            The component will generate a grid of divs by the rules (plain CSS) inside it.
            You can easily manipulate those cells using CSS to come up with a graphic pattern or an animated graph.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>The limit is the limit of CSS itself</strong>.

          <p>
            There's an alternative way to set up the <code>grid</code> by using the <a href="#property-@grid">@grid</a> property.

          <p>
            It's highly recommended to write the rules this way if you want to use css-doodle in production websites.
            So it won't break when the network is slow or when the browser does not support Web Component.

            All random values will be regenerated to the same value as last time based on the <em>seed</em> value.
            It's quite useful if you want to keep a snapshot.

            </css-doodle>
          </p>

          <p>
            A random <code>seed</code> will be generated by default if you don't specify explictly, and
            you can always get the generated value with <a href="#js-api-seed">JS API</a> later.

          <p>
            The <code>:container</code>
            is the container element that holds all the cells, which is using <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-grid-1/">Grid Layout</a>.
            You may want to set <code>gap</code> inside it.
          </p>
          <p>
            
            <css-doodle>
              :doodle {
                @grid: 8 / 8em;
                overflow: hidden;
              }
              :container {
                gap: 1px;
                transform: rotate(45deg) scale(1.5);

          <p>
            It inherits all the grid properties from <code>:doodle</code> so that's why this also works:
