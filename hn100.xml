    <p>Just in time for me to start a new job at a new place, my RSI has decided to flare up.</p>
<div><p><img alt="Cadey is coffee" loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.xeiaso.net/sticker/cadey/coffee/64"></p><div><p>&lt;<a href="https://xeiaso.net/characters#cadey"><b>Cadey</b></a>&gt; </p><p>For the record, I'm fine, I've known this has been coming for a while. The
flare-up is on its exit anyways. I've gotten lucky and I'm going to be fine.
But it's still a bit of a bummer.</p></div></div>
<p>The last time this happened, I was able to get by by doing mostly writing about technology things, but I think I'm going to need to be able to program again. I know I'm a bit of an emacs user, but for this I've been using visual studio code because of one extension in particular: <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pokey.cursorless">Cursorless</a>.</p>
<p>Cursorless is a plugin that integrates with voice control software to let you do AST level code editing with your voice. This is crazy alien magic from the future.</p>
<p>I've talked about cursorless before on my blog, but I have decided to really get deep into it this time around. The last time I used it, I didn't actually use it for much more than moving around the screen, but this time I'm going to try to use it for everything.</p>
<p>I wish I had this as an input method for slack and discord messages.</p>
<p>The most magic parts about this are the ideas of destinations and targets when it comes to cursorless inputs. Targets are individual anchors in a document and destinations are places relative to individual targets. Every single token in a document is given a hat over a letter with a color. These hats act as anchors that let you give commands based off of locations, destinations, and paths between them. Here's a simple example. Consider this code:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>function</span> <span>fetchBlog</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
</span><span>  <span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>"https://xeiaso.net/blog.json"</span><span>)</span>
</span><span>    <span>.</span><span>then</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>response</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
</span><span>      <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span>response<span>.</span><span>ok</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
</span><span>        <span>throw</span> <span>new</span> <span>Error</span><span>(</span><span>"Network response was not ok"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</span><span>      <span>}</span>
</span><span>      <span>return</span> response<span>.</span><span>json</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</span><span>    <span>}</span><span>)</span>
</span><span>    <span>.</span><span>then</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span>data<span>)</span><span>)</span>
</span><span>    <span>.</span><span>catch</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>error</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>console</span><span>.</span><span>error</span><span>(</span><span>"Error:"</span><span>,</span> error<span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</span><span><span>}</span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>This is a fairly standard looking JavaScript function. But, cursorless puts a bunch of hats over all of the code so it may look something like this:</p>
<figure><a href="https://cdn.xeiaso.net/file/christine-static/blog/2023/cl-note/cursorless-hats.jpg"><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="https://cdn.xeiaso.net/file/christine-static/blog/2023/cl-note/cursorless-hats.avif"><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.xeiaso.net/file/christine-static/blog/2023/cl-note/cursorless-hats.webp"><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.xeiaso.net/file/christine-static/blog/2023/cl-note/cursorless-hats.jpg"></picture></a></figure>
<div><p><img alt="Aoi is wut" loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.xeiaso.net/sticker/aoi/wut/64"></p><div><p>&lt;<a href="https://xeiaso.net/characters#aoi"><b>Aoi</b></a>&gt; </p><p>So that's why your editor is full of random video artifacts?</p></div></div>
<div><p><img alt="Cadey is enby" loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.xeiaso.net/sticker/cadey/enby/64"></p><div><p>&lt;<a href="https://xeiaso.net/characters#cadey"><b>Cadey</b></a>&gt; </p><p>They're not artifacts, they're targets!</p></div></div>
<p>Take a good look at that picture again:</p>
<figure><a href="https://cdn.xeiaso.net/file/christine-static/blog/2023/cl-note/cursorless-hats.jpg"><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="https://cdn.xeiaso.net/file/christine-static/blog/2023/cl-note/cursorless-hats.avif"><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.xeiaso.net/file/christine-static/blog/2023/cl-note/cursorless-hats.webp"><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.xeiaso.net/file/christine-static/blog/2023/cl-note/cursorless-hats.jpg"></picture></a></figure>
<p>The hats are color coded above individual letters. The position tells you the name and the color tells you how to disambiguate it. For example, That word <code>function</code> would be referred to as <code>green urge</code> because the hat is green over the letter u. If I wanted to delete that word for some reason or if I wanted to move it somewhere else, I could use <code>green urge</code> as the target for that action.</p>
<p>By itself, this gives you some pretty powerful actions and effectively lets you do spoken vim motions. But, that is only thinking in terms of simple actions that you can do with your editor. The real power of cursorless comes in from not only the idea of paths (such as <code>green urge past green bat</code> to select the <code>function fetchBlog</code> in that screenshot), but the fact that cursorless knows what the AST of the language is doing. This means that you can do things across the entire function, like deleting it or moving it somewhere else. As an example, here are the lambdas of this function visualized separately (with the "visualize lambdas" command):</p>
<figure><a href="https://cdn.xeiaso.net/file/christine-static/blog/2023/cl-note/cursorless-lambda.jpg"><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="https://cdn.xeiaso.net/file/christine-static/blog/2023/cl-note/cursorless-lambda.avif"><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.xeiaso.net/file/christine-static/blog/2023/cl-note/cursorless-lambda.webp"><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.xeiaso.net/file/christine-static/blog/2023/cl-note/cursorless-lambda.jpg"></picture></a></figure>
<p>These AST units are also targets. This means that I can do things like select the body of a definition and then work off of that. So if I want to refactor this into an asynchronous function, the refactoring becomes trivial:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.xeiaso.net/file/christine-static/blog/2023/cl-note/async-refactor.gif" alt="a gif of doing the process of refactoring a synchronous function to an async function by writing it all using talon commands"></p>
<div><p><img alt="Aoi is grin" loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.xeiaso.net/sticker/aoi/grin/64"></p><div><p>&lt;<a href="https://xeiaso.net/characters#aoi"><b>Aoi</b></a>&gt; </p><p>That's pretty cool, but I don't think I'd be able to remember all of those
commands.</p></div></div>
<div><p><img alt="Cadey is enby" loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.xeiaso.net/sticker/cadey/enby/64"></p><div><p>&lt;<a href="https://xeiaso.net/characters#cadey"><b>Cadey</b></a>&gt; </p><p>After a while, they just become second nature like Vim commands do. I have
been forcing myself to use this over and over again for the past few days and
it's starting to become second nature. I'm introducing individual commands at
one of the time and building up into bigger and better things.</p></div></div>
<p>The real magic comes when you start writing your own commands with the full power of Cursorless and Talon. In that example I just showed you, I have a action for inserting <code>"async "</code> before the function definition. Here is the code for that:</p>
<pre><code><span>[state] async &lt;user.cursorless_destination&gt;:
</span><span>    user.cursorless_insert(cursorless_destination, "async")
</span></code></pre>
<p>You can break talon commands into two basic parts: patterns and captures. Patterns are the spoken words that you say and captures are the things that you want to extract out of what you say. In this case, the pattern is just the word <code>async</code> and the capture is the destination that you want to insert the word <code>async</code> before. The <code>&lt;user.cursorless_destination&gt;</code> capture is a special capture lets you specify if you want something before or after a target. Of course, this is just a very simple example and it can get way more intricate than this.</p>
<p>Here is the most complicated Talon rule I've written so far:</p>
<pre><code><span>(method|meth) &lt;user.letter&gt; [&lt;user.go_pointer&gt;] [&lt;user.go_visibility&gt;] &lt;user.text&gt; [over] [&lt;user.go_visibility&gt;] named &lt;user.text&gt; [over]:
</span><span>    user.go_method(go_pointer or "", letter, go_visibility_1 or "public", text_1, go_visibility_2 or "public", text_2)
</span></code></pre>
<div><p><img alt="Aoi is wut" loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.xeiaso.net/sticker/aoi/wut/64"></p><div><p>&lt;<a href="https://xeiaso.net/characters#aoi"><b>Aoi</b></a>&gt; </p><p>What the heck is going on there?</p></div></div>
<p>This looks like a lot, but it is actually really simple. This lets you declare a method in Go. In Go, a method looks like this:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>func</span> <span>(</span>reciever <span>*</span>Type<span>)</span> <span>MethodName</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
</span><span>    <span>// function body here or something</span>
</span><span><span>}</span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>Pedantically, Go doesn't have methods in the traditional sense, it just has functions that take structs as the receiver (read: a hidden first argument but in a way that is namespaced to that struct in particular). Without something to automate writing this for you, you would have to say something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>state funk args word reciever space star hammer type over go right space hammer method name args go right brack enter</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's a lot of words to say. But, with this talon rule, you can just say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>meth r raised type named method name over</p>
</blockquote>
<div><p><img alt="Aoi is wut" loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.xeiaso.net/sticker/aoi/wut/64"></p><div><p>&lt;<a href="https://xeiaso.net/characters#aoi"><b>Aoi</b></a>&gt; </p><p>That's still a lot of words.</p></div></div>
<div><p><img alt="Cadey is enby" loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.xeiaso.net/sticker/cadey/enby/64"></p><div><p>&lt;<a href="https://xeiaso.net/characters#cadey"><b>Cadey</b></a>&gt; </p><p>Well, yes, you're not going to be able to get over that. But this is at least
more efficient and it makes more sense. I'm not going to be able to get rid of
all of the words, but I can at least make it so that it's close to how I
conceptualize it in my head.</p></div></div>
<div><p><img alt="Aoi is wut" loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.xeiaso.net/sticker/aoi/wut/64"></p><div><p>&lt;<a href="https://xeiaso.net/characters#aoi"><b>Aoi</b></a>&gt; </p><p>I guess that makes sense, but what do you mean by raised? I don't think go has
raised types I know it has pointers but not "raising". What is raising?</p></div></div>
<p>I'm glad you asked! This is something that I'm experimenting with to try to find a different way to explain the concept of pointers in Go. I think that one of the oversights in the Go language is that pointers use C-style syntax. This specifically has you use an <code>*</code> to lower a value from a pointer value to a normal value and <code>&amp;</code> to raise the value from a normal value into a pointer value.</p>
<p>Since I'm taking the opportunity to radically redesign the Talon bindings for Go, I want to try unifying the syntax of pointer values into the idea of raising and lowering to see how it makes it easier to understand Go programs. I don't know if this is a good idea, but you have to fuck around in order to find out.</p>
<p>Maybe some parts of our industry are actually good. I really hope that I get led into the <a href="https://githubnext.com/projects/copilot-voice/">GitHub copilot voice beta</a> soon, I want to compare how Talon does voice coding versus how copilot voice does it.</p>

								<p><span><span data-start="0.0">Welcome, my name is Jedd Haberstro, </span></span><span><span data-start="3.0">and I'm an Engineer in Apple's GPU, Graphics, </span></span><span><span data-start="6.0">and Displays Software Group.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="9.0">I'm excited to tell you </span></span><span><span data-start="10.0">about the new Apple family 9 GPU architecture </span></span><span><span data-start="14.0">in A17 Pro and the M3 family of chips, </span></span><span><span data-start="17.0">which are at the heart of iPhone 15 Pro and the new Max.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="23.0">Across Apple's product line, </span></span><span><span data-start="25.0">the GPU powers many of the rich user experiences </span></span><span><span data-start="28.0">our customers love. </span></span><span><span data-start="30.0">Whether it be gaming on the go with the new iPhone 15 Pro, </span></span><span><span data-start="36.0">delivering silky smooth UI animations for your apps </span></span><span><span data-start="39.0">on the new iMac, </span></span><span><span data-start="41.0">or leveraging machine learning </span></span><span><span data-start="43.0">to perform advanced video and image processing </span></span><span><span data-start="46.0">on the new MacBook Pros, </span></span><span><span data-start="49.0">the GPU plays a critical role in enabling these apps.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="55.0">The Metal API is used to harness the computing capabilities </span></span><span><span data-start="59.0">of Apple's GPUs, </span></span><span><span data-start="60.0">and collectively, these apps run a diverse set </span></span><span><span data-start="63.0">of Metal Shading Language programs. </span></span><span><span data-start="66.0">These shader programs can range from small, simple shaders </span></span><span><span data-start="70.0">that execute just a handful of lines of code </span></span><span><span data-start="73.0">to large complex shaders </span></span><span><span data-start="75.0">that spend hundreds of thousands of lines of code, </span></span><span><span data-start="78.0">frameworks, and libraries. </span></span><span><span data-start="80.0">What all these shaders share in common </span></span><span><span data-start="83.0">is massive data parallelism, </span></span><span><span data-start="86.0">which is the opportunity </span></span><span><span data-start="87.0">to greatly improve the performance of an app </span></span><span><span data-start="89.0">by running it in parallel. </span></span><span><span data-start="91.0">This parallelism is achieved </span></span><span><span data-start="93.0">by running Metal shader programs many times over in parallel </span></span><span><span data-start="97.0">on different inputs </span></span><span><span data-start="98.0">such as each vertex in a 3D rendered scene </span></span><span><span data-start="102.0">or each pixel of the screen.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="106.0">It is the GPU, ultimately, </span></span><span><span data-start="108.0">which is responsible for executing these shaders </span></span><span><span data-start="111.0">in parallel.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="114.0">At the heart of every GPU are its shader cores. </span></span><span><span data-start="117.0">Each shader core can run thousands of threads in parallel. </span></span><span><span data-start="121.0">And to scale performance even further, </span></span><span><span data-start="123.0">a GPU will have many shader cores </span></span><span><span data-start="125.0">that can also run in parallel, </span></span><span><span data-start="127.0">giving an app tens of thousands </span></span><span><span data-start="129.0">of parallel threads of execution.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="132.0">Already, the GPUs in today's existing iPhones, iPads, </span></span><span><span data-start="136.0">and Macs, have incredible performance.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="140.0">As well as a powerful suite of developer tools </span></span><span><span data-start="143.0">to allow app developers to maximize the GPU's potential. </span></span><span><span data-start="147.0">But with the new Apple family 9 GPUs, </span></span><span><span data-start="150.0">we are increasing performance to unprecedented levels </span></span><span><span data-start="153.0">thanks to several new exciting advancements.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="157.0">First is a brand new shader core architecture </span></span><span><span data-start="161.0">that improves the performance and power efficiency </span></span><span><span data-start="163.0">of your existing apps, </span></span><span><span data-start="165.0">which, right away, benefits the experience you deliver </span></span><span><span data-start="168.0">while also meeting the demanding challenges </span></span><span><span data-start="171.0">of the next-generation of apps that you will build.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="175.0">Hardware-accelerated ray tracing transparently benefits apps </span></span><span><span data-start="180.0">that already use Metal's ray tracing APIs, </span></span><span><span data-start="183.0">as well as expands the opportunities to use ray tracing </span></span><span><span data-start="186.0">to achieve rich rendering effects with great performance.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="191.0">And with hardware-accelerated mesh shading, </span></span><span><span data-start="193.0">apps can build advanced geometry processing pipelines </span></span><span><span data-start="196.0">like never before.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="199.0">Before we discuss these in more detail, </span></span><span><span data-start="201.0">let's look at the incredible performance </span></span><span><span data-start="204.0">apps are already able to achieve </span></span><span><span data-start="206.0">with no changes on the new Apple family 9 GPUs. </span></span><span><span data-start="210.0">This is "Baldur's Gate 3" by Larian Studios, </span></span><span><span data-start="214.0">running on the new MacBook Pro

</span></span><span><span data-start="230.0">thanks to the next-generation shader core's ability </span></span><span><span data-start="233.0">to run the game's Metal shaders </span></span><span><span

data-start="282.0">starting with the next generation shader core.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="286.0">The Apple family 9 GPUs are composed </span></span><span><span data-start="289.0">of several building blocks </span></span><span><span data-start="291.0">such as compute and vertex command processors </span></span><span><span data-start="294.0">that parse your Metal command buffers, </span></span><span><span data-start="296.0">a rasterizer that dispatches fragment shaders for execution, </span></span><span><span data-start="302.0">and a hierarchy of caches, </span></span><span><span data-start="304.0">including the GPU last level cache </span></span><span><span data-start="306.0">that services all GPU memory traffic.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="310.0">But central to any GPU are its shader cores. </span></span><span><span data-start="314.0">These are the building blocks </span></span><span><span data-start="315.0">that execute your app's Metal shaders.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="319.0">The shader core is also paired with a texture unit </span></span><span><span data-start="322.0">that can sample and write your texture resources, </span></span><span><span data-start="325.0">as well as a brand new ray tracing unit </span></span><span><span data-start="327.0">that accelerates ray intersection requests.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="333.0">A shader core can be further subdivided </span></span><span><span data-start="335.0">into its constituent parts.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="338.0">Each shader core has an array of execution pipelines </span></span><span><span data-start="341.0">that execute different types of instructions, </span></span><span><span data-start="343.0">such as FP32, FP16, and Integer math, </span></span><span><span data-start="347.0">which correspond to operations on variables in your shaders </span></span><span><span data-start="351.0">with Metal data types such as float, half, and int, </span></span><span><span data-start="354.0">as well as memory pipelines for read and write operations </span></span><span><span data-start="357.0">to textures and buffers.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="360.0">Keeping all of these execution pipelines busy </span></span><span><span data-start="362.0">usually requires executing instructions </span></span><span><span data-start="365.0">from multiple SIMDgroups. </span></span><span><span data-start="367.0">So there's a pool that keeps track of the SIMDgroups </span></span><span><span data-start="370.0">that are running on a shader core, </span></span><span><span data-start="372.0">and a scheduler that chooses which SIMDgroup </span></span><span><span data-start="374.0">to execute instructions from next.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="377.0">Typically, there's also a handful of on-chip memories </span></span><span><span data-start="380.0">for storing the different types of data </span></span><span><span data-start="382.0">a shader program may use, </span></span><span><span data-start="384.0">such as registers for storing the values of variables, </span></span><span><span data-start="388.0">threadgroup and tile memory </span></span><span><span data-start="389.0">for storing data shared across a compute threadgroup </span></span><span><span data-start="392.0">or color attachment data shared across the tile, </span></span><span><span data-start="397.0">and a cache to improve the performance of accesses </span></span><span><span data-start="399.0">to the stack and to buffers.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="403.0">With this understanding of what a shader core does </span></span><span><span data-start="405.0">and its constituent pieces, </span></span><span><span data-start="407.0">I'd like to explain three new exciting advancements </span></span><span><span data-start="410.0">in the Apple family 9 GPU shader core. </span></span><span><span data-start="413.0">These advancements will increase the performance </span></span><span><span data-start="416.0">of your shaders with no changes to your app. </span></span><span><span data-start="419.0">But by better understanding how this new shader core works, </span></span><span><span data-start="422.0">you'll be able to benefit from it to an even greater degree.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="428.0">The first change is dynamic shader core memory, </span></span><span><span data-start="432.0">which allows an app to achieve better thread occupancy, </span></span><span><span data-start="435.0">and as a result, often better performance.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="438.0">The second change is the flexible on-chip memory. </span></span><span><span data-start="442.0">This will increase the efficiency </span></span><span><span data-start="444.0">by which your shaders access buffer, stack, threadgroup, </span></span><span><span data-start="447.0">and tile memory.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="450.0">The last change is the shader core's </span></span><span><span data-start="452.0">high-performance ALU pipelines, </span></span><span><span data-start="455.0">which have increased their ability to execute in parallel. </span></span><span><span data-start="458.0">This will improve the performance of apps </span></span><span><span data-start="460.0">that perform a combination of floating point </span></span><span><span data-start="462.0">or integer math.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="465.0">Before further exploring these new features, </span></span><span><span data-start="467.0">let's dive into more detail </span></span><span><span data-start="469.0">about how a shader core keeps its execution pipelines busy </span></span><span><span data-start="472.0">and the importance of thread occupancy in this endeavor.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="477.0">Suppose your Metal shader, </span></span><span><span data-start="479.0">after executing some math operations </span></span><span><span data-start="481.0">using the ALU pipelines, reads a buffer </span></span><span><span data-start="484.0">whose result will be used immediately after. </span></span><span><span data-start="487.0">Accessing the buffer </span></span><span><span data-start="488.0">may require going all the way to device memory, </span></span><span><span data-start="491.0">which is a long latency operation. </span></span><span><span data-start="494.0">During this time, </span></span><span><span data-start="495.0">the SIMDgroup can't execute other operations, </span></span><span><span data-start="498.0">which causes the ALU pipelines to go unused.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="502.0">To mitigate this, the shader core can execute instructions </span></span><span><span data-start="505.0">from a different SIMDgroup, </span></span><span><span data-start="507.0">which may have some ALU instructions of its own. </span></span><span><span data-start="510.0">This reduces the amount of time the ALUs go and used </span></span><span><span data-start="513.0">and allows the SIMDgroups to run in parallel, </span></span><span><span data-start="516.0">thus improving performance.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="520.0">If there are additional SIMDgroups </span></span><span><span data-start="522.0">running on the shader core, </span></span><span><span data-start="523.0">this can be done many times over </span></span><span><span data-start="525.0">until the ALUs and other execution pipelines </span></span><span><span data-start="528.0">are never starved of instructions to execute.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="531.0">The number of SIMDgroups </span></span><span><span data-start="532.0">that are concurrently running on a shader core </span></span><span><span data-start="535.0">is called its thread occupancy.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="538.0">But you may be asking yourself, </span></span><span><span data-start="539.0">what dictates how many SIMDgroups </span></span><span><span data-start="541.0">will be running concurrently on a shader core? </span></span><span><span data-start="545.0">To answer that question, let's look at an example. </span></span><span><span data-start="549.0">This is a prototypical ray tracing compute kernel </span></span><span><span data-start="552.0">that intersects a ray with an acceleration structure, </span></span><span><span data-start="557.0">inspects the intersection result, </span></span><span><span data-start="561.0">and then executes a different shading function </span></span><span><span data-start="564.0">based on the material of the primitive intersected. </span></span><span><span data-start="566.0">In this example, </span></span><span><span data-start="567.0">it supports shading both glass and leather materials.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="573.0">Each line of code will use some amount of registers </span></span><span><span data-start="575.0">to store the program's variables. </span></span><span><span data-start="577.0">At different points of the program, </span></span><span><span data-start="579.0">more or fewer registers will be used </span></span><span><span data-start="581.0">depending on what the code does. </span></span><span><span data-start="584.0">In this particular example, </span></span><span><span data-start="586.0">the implementation of the shadeGlass function </span></span><span><span data-start="588.0">uses many more registers than the rest of the program.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="593.0">Prior to the Apple family 9 GPU, </span></span><span><span data-start="596.0">a SIMDgroup could not begin execution on a shader core </span></span><span><span data-start="599.0">until it allocated registers from the on-chip register file. </span></span><span><span data-start="603.0">The amount allocated would be equal </span></span><span><span data-start="605.0">to the maximum register usage at any point in the program. </span></span><span><span data-start="609.0">The SIMDgroup would keep that many registers allocated </span></span><span><span data-start="612.0">for the entire duration of the SIMDgroup, </span></span><span><span data-start="615.0">even though most of those registers may go unused </span></span><span><span data-start="618.0">in large sections of the program. </span></span><span><span data-start="620.0">Thus, based on the maximum register usage, </span></span><span><span data-start="623.0">we may only be able to run, for example, </span></span><span><span data-start="626.0">four SIMDgroups at a time on a shader core </span></span><span><span data-start="628.0">because any more would require </span></span><span><span data-start="629.0">more on-chip register filed memory than exists. </span></span><span><span data-start="633.0">However, thanks to the Apple family 9 GPU's </span></span><span><span data-start="636.0">new dynamic shader core memory feature, </span></span><span><span data-start="639.0">the maximum register usage no longer dictates </span></span><span><span data-start="642.0">how many SIMDgroups can be run. </span></span><span><span data-start="645.0">On-chip register memory is now dynamically allocated </span></span><span><span data-start="648.0">and deallocated over the lifetime of the shader </span></span><span><span data-start="651.0">according to what each part of the program actually uses. </span></span><span><span data-start="655.0">This allows SIMDgroups to make much more efficient use </span></span><span><span data-start="659.0">of the on-chip register file, freeing up space </span></span><span><span data-start="662.0">that would not have been available otherwise. </span></span><span><span data-start="665.0">This can have a profound impact </span></span><span><span data-start="666.0">on your app's thread occupancy, </span></span><span><span data-start="668.0">and ultimately, its performance </span></span><span><span data-start="671.0">by allowing many more SIMDgroups to run concurrently.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="675.0">As I just mentioned, </span></span><span><span data-start="677.0">registers are now dynamically allocated and deallocated </span></span><span><span data-start="679.0">over the course of a SIMDgroup's lifetime. </span></span><span><span data-start="682.0">This is in part possible </span></span><span><span data-start="685.0">because the register file is now a cache </span></span><span><span data-start="687.0">instead of the permanent storage for the registers, </span></span><span><span data-start="690.0">meaning more registers can be used </span></span><span><span data-start="692.0">that can be stored on chip.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="695.0">The flexible on-chip memory feature extends this treatment </span></span><span><span data-start="698.0">to the rest of the shader core's memory types, </span></span><span><span data-start="700.0">such as threadgroup and tile memory, </span></span><span><span data-start="703.0">making that a cache too.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="706.0">And now that register, threadgroup, tile, stack, </span></span><span><span data-start="711.0">and buffer data are all cached on chip, </span></span><span><span data-start="713.0">this has allowed us to redesign the on-chip memories </span></span><span><span data-start="716.0">into fewer larger caches </span></span><span><span data-start="719.0">that service all these memory types. </span></span><span><span data-start="721.0">This flexibility will benefit shaders </span></span><span><span data-start="723.0">that don't make heavy use of each memory type. </span></span><span><span data-start="727.0">In the past, if a compute kernel didn't use, for example, </span></span><span><span data-start="730.0">threadgroup memory, its corresponding on-chip storage </span></span><span><span data-start="733.0">would go completely unused. </span></span><span><span data-start="736.0">Now, the on-chip storage will be dynamically assigned </span></span><span><span data-start="739.0">to the memory types that are used by your shaders, </span></span><span><span data-start="742.0">giving them more on-chip storage than they had in the past, </span></span><span><span data-start="745.0">and ultimately, better performance.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="749.0">For example, for shaders with heavy register usage, </span></span><span><span data-start="752.0">that may mean higher occupancy.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="755.0">For shaders that repeatedly access a large working set </span></span><span><span data-start="759.0">of buffer data, that will mean better cache hit rates, </span></span><span><span data-start="762.0">lower buffer access latency, and thus, better performance. </span></span><span><span data-start="767.0">And for apps that make heavy use of non-inline functions, </span></span><span><span data-start="770.0">such as function pointers, visible function tables, </span></span><span><span data-start="774.0">and dynamically linked shader libraries, </span></span><span><span data-start="776.0">this means more on-chip stack space </span></span><span><span data-start="778.0">to pass function parameters, </span></span><span><span data-start="780.0">and thus, faster function calls.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="784.0">But what happens if your app still uses more memory </span></span><span><span data-start="787.0">than there is on-chip storage for? </span></span><span><span data-start="790.0">Unmitigated, that data will spill to the next cache level </span></span><span><span data-start="793.0">or even to main memory. </span></span><span><span data-start="796.0">Fortunately, the shader core will dynamically monitor </span></span><span><span data-start="799.0">your shaker's behavior and adjust the occupancy level </span></span><span><span data-start="802.0">to prevent this from occurring. </span></span><span><span data-start="804.0">This keeps data on chip. </span></span><span><span data-start="806.0">And ultimately, the execution pipelines busy.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="810.0">This does mean, however, </span></span><span><span data-start="812.0">that your shader's occupancy will be impacted </span></span><span><span data-start="815.0">by how your shader's access threadgroup, tile, </span></span><span><span data-start="817.0">stack, and buffer memory </span></span><span><span data-start="819.0">in addition to its dynamic register usage.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="823.0">These new hardware capabilities </span></span><span><span data-start="825.0">improve the occupancy of many apps, </span></span><span><span data-start="827.0">meaning you, the developer, need to optimize occupancy </span></span><span><span data-start="831.0">a lot less often than in the past. </span></span><span><span data-start="833.0">But if you do need to optimize occupancy further </span></span><span><span data-start="837.0">on Apple family 9 GPUs, </span></span><span><span data-start="839.0">we have developed a suite of profiling tools to help you. </span></span><span><span data-start="842.0">To learn more about how to diagnose and optimize occupancy, </span></span><span><span data-start="846.0">please refer to these talks.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="850.0">The last feature of the Apple family 9 GPU shader core </span></span><span><span data-start="853.0">I'd like to discuss is its high-performance ALU pipelines.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="859.0">Apple GPU shader cores have separate ALU pipelines </span></span><span><span data-start="862.0">for different instruction types, </span></span><span><span data-start="864.0">including FP16 instructions. </span></span><span><span data-start="867.0">Apple GPUs are highly optimized to execute FP16 arithmetic. </span></span><span><span data-start="872.0">And we recommend that you'll use FP16 data types </span></span><span><span data-start="876.0">wherever possible.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="878.0">FP16 math instructions execute at peak throughput.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="883.0">They use fewer registers than their FP32 equivalents. </span></span><span><span data-start="888.0">They reduce memory bandwidth </span></span><span><span data-start="889.0">if your buffers store data natively in FP16. </span></span><span><span data-start="893.0">And for situations where the source </span></span><span><span data-start="895.0">or destination variable of a math operation </span></span><span><span data-start="898.0">is not FP16 already, </span></span><span><span data-start="900.0">it can be converted to and from at no cost.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="904.0">But if your app still performs other math operations, </span></span><span><span data-start="908.0">such as FP32 and integer, </span></span><span><span data-start="910.0">the Apple family 9 GPU shader core can execute instructions </span></span><span><span data-start="913.0">from all three data types in parallel </span></span><span><span data-start="916.0">to a greater degree than ever before. </span></span><span><span data-start="919.0">This can deliver up to 2x ALU performance </span></span><span><span data-start="922.0">compared to prior Apple GPUs. </span></span><span><span data-start="925.0">In order to take advantage of this extra parallelism, </span></span><span><span data-start="928.0">instructions must be executed from multiple SIMDgroups, </span></span><span><span data-start="931.0">which means increasing occupancy </span></span><span><span data-start="934.0">can improve the utilization of the ALU pipelines. </span></span><span><span data-start="938.0">Let's consider an example. </span></span><span><span data-start="940.0">Imagine there are two SIMDgroups running concurrently, </span></span><span><span data-start="943.0">both executing ALU instructions. </span></span><span><span data-start="946.0">In the past, these SIMDgroups may have had to run </span></span><span><span data-start="949.0">one after another.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="952.0">But if they have FP32 and FP16 instructions </span></span><span><span data-start="956.0">to execute at different points in time, as depicted here, </span></span><span><span data-start="960.0">then their executions can be overlapped, </span></span><span><span data-start="963.0">increasing parallelism and performance.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="967.0">To recap what's new in the next-generation shader core, </span></span><span><span data-start="972.0">it will dynamically allocate and deallocate registers </span></span><span><span data-start="975.0">over the lifetime of a shader, </span></span><span><span data-start="976.0">which improves its thread occupancy.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="980.0">It has a large on-chip cache </span></span><span><span data-start="982.0">that services registers, threadgroup, tile, stack, </span></span><span><span data-start="986.0">and buffer memory, which improves the performance </span></span><span><span data-start="989.0">of accessing those memory types.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="993.0">The shader core will dynamically adjust occupancy </span></span><span><span data-start="995.0">to keep data on chip and the execution pipelines busy.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="1000.0">And finally, FP16, FP32 and integer operations </span></span><span><span data-start="1005.0">can execute in parallel more than ever, </span></span><span><span data-start="1007.0">increasing ALU performance.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="1012.0">Next, let's take a look at hardware-accelerated ray tracing.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="1019.0">With Metal ray tracing, </span></span><span><span data-start="1020.0">apps can leverage the massive parallelism of Apple GPUs </span></span><span><span data-start="1024.0">to intersect rays with their scene geometry. </span></span><span><span data-start="1027.0">If you're not familiar with Metal ray tracing </span></span><span><span data-start="1029.0">and would like to learn more, </span></span><span><span data-start="1031.0">please watch Your guide to Metal ray tracing </span></span><span><span data-start="1034.0">and Enhance your app with Metal ray tracing.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="1040.0">At the heart of the Metal ray chasing API </span></span><span><span data-start="1043.0">is the intersector object </span></span><span><span data-start="1044.0">that is responsible for determining </span></span><span><span data-start="1046.0">the intersection point of a ray </span></span><span><span data-start="1048.0">with the primitives contained in an acceleration structure. </span></span><span><span data-start="1052.0">It is often invoked many times over </span></span><span><span data-start="1054.0">by ray tracing app's GPU functions, also known as shaders, </span></span><span><span data-start="1058.0">and thus, is central to the app's performance.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="1062.0">Earlier, I showed such AGPU function </span></span><span><span data-start="1065.0">when I looked at the register usage </span></span><span><span data-start="1067.0">of this raytracingKernel. </span></span><span><span data-start="1069.0">It creates an intersector object </span></span><span><span data-start="1072.0">and finds an intersection </span></span><span><span data-start="1074.0">by calling the object's intersect method.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="1079.0">To determine the intersection point, </span></span><span><span data-start="1081.0">the intersector performs a few key stages. </span></span><span><span data-start="1085.0">First, it traverses the acceleration structure </span></span><span><span data-start="1088.0">to find a candidate primitive. </span></span><span><span data-start="1090.0">It then invokes an intersection function, </span></span><span><span data-start="1093.0">which may be provided by the app, </span></span><span><span data-start="1095.0">to determine if the rate intersects the primitive.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="1099.0">If it does, </span></span><span><span data-start="1100.0">the intersection is compared to previous intersections </span></span><span><span data-start="1103.0">and the process is repeated until the closest is found.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="1107.0">The closest intersection is then returned </span></span><span><span data-start="1109.0">to the calling GPU function </span></span><span><span data-start="1111.0">for further app-specific processing.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="1115.0">New in Apple family 9 GPUs, </span></span><span><span data-start="1118.0">the implementation of the intersector object </span></span><span><span data-start="1120.0">is hardware-accelerated, </span></span><span><span data-start="1122.0">which greatly increases the performance </span></span><span><span data-start="1124.0">of this critical operation.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="1128.0">The hardware-accelerated intersection </span></span><span><span data-start="1130.0">does not execute in line with the GPU function. </span></span><span><span data-start="1133.0">Thus, to facilitate the communication of the ray </span></span><span><span data-start="1136.0">and the ray payload between the two, </span></span><span><span data-start="1138.0">data is read and written to on-chip memory, </span></span><span><span data-start="1141.0">which you can observe </span></span><span><span data-start="1142.0">using the RT scratch performance counters in the new Xcode.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="1146.0">Now that I've discussed the role </span></span><span><span data-start="1148.0">and responsibilities of the intersector, </span></span><span><span data-start="1150.0">let's dissect the performance characteristics </span></span><span><span data-start="1153.0">of onetime through this intersector loop using an example.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="1158.0">Imagine our app is executing two SIMDgroups </span></span><span><span data-start="1161.0">that each wish to intersect four rays </span></span><span><span data-start="1163.0">with an acceleration structure.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="1167.0">In this example, </span></span><span><span data-start="1168.0">our acceleration structure contains </span></span><span><span data-start="1170.0">the classic kernel boxing, </span></span><span><span data-start="1172.0">with one box object and one sphere object.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="1176.0">The rays are cast into the scene </span></span><span><span data-start="1177.0">by calling the intersect method, </span></span><span><span data-start="1179.0">passing it the ray, the acceleration structure, </span></span><span><span data-start="1182.0">and the intersection function table. </span></span><span><span data-start="1185.0">Each SIMDgroup has two rays that intersect the box </span></span><span><span data-start="1188.0">and two the intersect the sphere. </span></span><span><span data-start="1191.0">In this example, </span></span><span><span data-start="1192.0">the box is defined as opaque triangle primitives </span></span><span><span data-start="1196.0">by using the MTLAccelerationStructure </span></span><span><span data-start="1199.0">TriangleGeometryDescriptor </span></span><span><span data-start="1201.0">and setting its opaque property to yes, </span></span><span><span data-start="1203.0">thus, the intersection can compute the intersections </span></span><span><span data-start="1206.0">using Metal's built-in intersection function.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="1211.0">However, the sphere is defined procedurally </span></span><span><span data-start="1213.0">using a custom bounding box intersection function </span></span><span><span data-start="1216.0">that the intersection must invoke.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="1220.0">The custom BoundingBoxIntersection function is declared </span></span><span><span data-start="1223.0">using the intersection attribute </span></span><span><span data-start="1224.0">with the bounding_box parameter.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="1228.0">As I mentioned before, </span></span><span><span data-start="1230.0">the intersect method is called by each thread </span></span><span><span data-start="1232.0">that is testing a ray against the acceleration structure. </span></span><span><span data-start="1235.0">So with this example in mind, </span></span><span><span data-start="1237.0">let's look at how each intersect calls traversal </span></span><span><span data-start="1241.0">and intersection test are executed </span></span><span><span data-start="1243.0">in a traditional implementation.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="1247.0">In typical usage, </span></span><span><span data-start="1248.0">not all traversals will take the same amount of time </span></span><span><span data-start="1250.0">to locate a primitive to test the ray against. </span></span><span><span data-start="1254.0">This creates what is called execution divergence, </span></span><span><span data-start="1257.0">which causes each thread in a SIMDgroup </span></span><span><span data-start="1259.0">to wait for the longest traversal from that SIMDgroup </span></span><span><span data-start="1261.0">before proceeding to the next stage.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="1265.0">And as it turns out, </span></span><span><span data-start="1266.0">the same overhead compounds </span></span><span><span data-start="1268.0">when executing the intersection functions too. </span></span><span><span data-start="1271.0">Execution divergence causes each type </span></span><span><span data-start="1274.0">of intersection function to run one after another, </span></span><span><span data-start="1276.0">further reducing parallelism. </span></span><span><span data-start="1279.0">An aggregate across both stages, </span></span><span><span data-start="1282.0">each thread spends a large proportion of its runtime idle, </span></span><span><span data-start="1285.0">waiting on the other threads in the SIMDgroup to complete, </span></span><span><span data-start="1288.0">which is a major performance bottleneck.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="1293.0">With that picture of a traditional implementation in mind, </span></span><span><span data-start="1296.0">let's discuss how hardware-accelerated ray tracing </span></span><span><span data-start="1299.0">optimizes those inefficiencies.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="1303.0">The first major improvement </span></span><span><span data-start="1304.0">is that the hardware intersector </span></span><span><span data-start="1306.0">is able to run each traversal completely independently </span></span><span><span data-start="1310.0">using fixed function hardware. </span></span><span><span data-start="1312.0">This is possible in part </span></span><span><span data-start="1314.0">because the arrays are sent to the hardware intersector </span></span><span><span data-start="1316.0">for processing </span></span><span><span data-start="1317.0">instead of executing in line with the GPU function. </span></span><span><span data-start="1321.0">This greatly decreases the time spent traversing </span></span><span><span data-start="1325.0">and also removes the overhead </span></span><span><span data-start="1326.0">of the traditional traversal's execution divergence.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="1333.0">On the other hand, the intersection functions </span></span><span><span data-start="1335.0">are Metal shading language code, </span></span><span><span data-start="1337.0">so they still must be grouped into SIMDgroups </span></span><span><span data-start="1339.0">to be run on the shader core. </span></span><span><span data-start="1342.0">However, because the hardware intersector </span></span><span><span data-start="1344.0">executes each ray independently, </span></span><span><span data-start="1347.0">it is free to group together the intersection function calls </span></span><span><span data-start="1350.0">from rays that originated from separate SIMDgroups.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="1355.0">This is the role of the reorder stage. </span></span><span><span data-start="1358.0">When rays reach this stage within close proximity and time, </span></span><span><span data-start="1362.0">the intersection function calls </span></span><span><span data-start="1364.0">will be grouped into coherent SIMDgroups, </span></span><span><span data-start="1366.0">such that the execution divergence overhead </span></span><span><span data-start="1369.0">present in the traditional implementation is reduced </span></span><span><span data-start="1372.0">or even completely eliminated.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="1376.0">So now that I've shown you </span></span><span><span data-start="1377.0">how hardware-accelerated ray tracing </span></span><span><span data-start="1380.0">improves the performance </span></span><span><span data-start="1381.0">of your app's ray intersector calls, </span></span><span><span data-start="1383.0">let's review some best practices </span></span><span><span data-start="1385.0">that your apps can implement to maximize its benefits.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="1390.0">Our first suggestion is to use the intersector object API </span></span><span><span data-start="1394.0">whenever possible. </span></span><span><span data-start="1395.0">Metal also allows ray tracing </span></span><span><span data-start="1397.0">to be performed using the intersection query API, </span></span><span><span data-start="1401.0">but this API increases </span></span><span><span data-start="1403.0">the amount of ray trace scratch memory </span></span><span><span data-start="1404.0">that must be read and written, </span></span><span><span data-start="1406.0">as well as disables the reorder stage.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="1410.0">We also recommend </span></span><span><span data-start="1411.0">when authoring custom intersection functions </span></span><span><span data-start="1414.0">to avoid creating one uber function </span></span><span><span data-start="1417.0">that is capable of executing </span></span><span><span data-start="1418.0">many different logical intersection routines. </span></span><span><span data-start="1422.0">Instead, create one Metal intersection function </span></span><span><span data-start="1425.0">for each logical intersection routine. </span></span><span><span data-start="1428.0">This increases the benefits of the reorder stage.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="1433.0">It is also important to try to minimize </span></span><span><span data-start="1435.0">the size of the ray payload structure that has passed to </span></span><span><span data-start="1438.0">and return from the intersector object. </span></span><span><span data-start="1441.0">This will decrease your shader's latency </span></span><span><span data-start="1443.0">and potentially increase its thread occupancy.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="1448.0">For more details and guidance </span></span><span><span data-start="1450.0">about how to optimize your ray tracing apps, </span></span><span><span data-start="1452.0">please watch these talks.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="1456.0">To recap, the Apple family 9 GPUs </span></span><span><span data-start="1459.0">greatly improved the performance of ray tracing </span></span><span><span data-start="1462.0">through new hardware acceleration </span></span><span><span data-start="1464.0">that features fixed function traversal blocks </span></span><span><span data-start="1466.0">and an intersection function reorder stage.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="1470.0">And although this new hardware </span></span><span><span data-start="1471.0">will improve the performance of all Metal ray tracing apps, </span></span><span><span data-start="1475.0">to maximize the benefits your app derives from it, </span></span><span><span data-start="1478.0">it's best to use the intersection API </span></span><span><span data-start="1481.0">instead of the intersection query API whenever possible.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="1486.0">The last advancement in the Apple family 9 GPUs </span></span><span><span data-start="1489.0">that I'd like to talk to you about </span></span><span><span data-start="1491.0">is hardware-accelerated mesh shading.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="1495.0">Mesh shading is a flexible, </span></span><span><span data-start="1497.0">GPU-driven geometry processing stage </span></span><span><span data-start="1499.0">in the rendering pipeline </span></span><span><span data-start="1501.0">that replaces the traditional vertex shader stage </span></span><span><span data-start="1504.0">with two compute-like shaders.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="1507.0">Object shaders execute in the first stage </span></span><span><span data-start="1509.0">and can be used to perform coarse grain processing </span></span><span><span data-start="1512.0">of app-specific inputs such as entire mesh objects. </span></span><span><span data-start="1516.0">Each object threadgroup can choose to spawn a mesh group </span></span><span><span data-start="1519.0">to perform subsequent finer grain processing. </span></span><span><span data-start="1523.0">Mesh shaders comprise the second stage. </span></span><span><span data-start="1526.0">Typically, a mesh threadgroup will process </span></span><span><span data-start="1528.0">a constituent piece of the parent object, </span></span><span><span data-start="1530.0">often referred to as a meshlet.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="1534.0">The output of the mesh threadgroup </span></span><span><span data-start="1536.0">is a Metal mesh object that encapsulates </span></span><span><span data-start="1539.0">a list of vertices and primitives </span></span><span><span data-start="1541.0">to be processed by the remainder </span></span><span><span data-start="1543.0">of the traditional graphics pipeline.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="1546.0">Mesh shading has numerous applications, </span></span><span><span data-start="1549.0">such as fine-grained geometry calling, </span></span><span><span data-start="1553.0">procedural geometry generation, </span></span><span><span data-start="1555.0">custom app-specific geometry representations, </span></span><span><span data-start="1559.0">such as compressed formats. </span></span><span><span data-start="1561.0">And for porting geometry and tessellation shaders </span></span><span><span data-start="1564.0">from other graphics APIs.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="1567.0">If you're unfamiliar with mesh shading in Metal, </span></span><span><span data-start="1569.0">I recommend that you check out the two talks below.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="1574.0">With hardware-accelerated mesh shading </span></span><span><span data-start="1576.0">on Apple family 9 GPUs, </span></span><span><span data-start="1578.0">the most notable improvement you'll observe </span></span><span><span data-start="1580.0">is much improved performance </span></span><span><span data-start="1582.0">of your existing mesh shading code..</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="1585.0">Apple family 9 GPUs </span></span><span><span data-start="1586.0">are able to much more efficiently schedule object </span></span><span><span data-start="1589.0">and mesh threadgroups </span></span><span><span data-start="1590.0">to keep intermediate meshlet data on chip. </span></span><span><span data-start="1593.0">Thus, reducing memory traffic.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="1596.0">With the new hardware </span></span><span><span data-start="1597.0">also comes several Metal API enhancements. </span></span><span><span data-start="1601.0">The first is support for encoding draw mesh commands </span></span><span><span data-start="1604.0">into indirect command buffers. </span></span><span><span data-start="1607.0">This allows GPU-driven rendering pipelines </span></span><span><span data-start="1609.0">to make use of mesh shading </span></span><span><span data-start="1611.0">in addition to traditional vertex shaders.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="1615.0">The second API enhancement </span></span><span><span data-start="1617.0">expands the maximum number of threadgroups per mesh grid </span></span><span><span data-start="1620.0">from 1,024 to over 1 million.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="1624.0">Let's now review a couple of best practices </span></span><span><span data-start="1627.0">to ensure optimal mesh shading performance.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="1632.0">The metal::mesh object output by a mesh threadgroup </span></span><span><span data-start="1635.0">has several template parameters </span></span><span><span data-start="1636.0">whose size are important to keep as small as possible.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="1641.0">For the mesh's vertex and primitive data types, </span></span><span><span data-start="1644.0">this can be done, for example, by removing unused attributes </span></span><span><span data-start="1649.0">that may be present due to sharing those data types </span></span><span><span data-start="1651.0">with other unrelated vertex or mesh functions. </span></span><span><span data-start="1654.0">The mesh type must also specify </span></span><span><span data-start="1656.0">the maximum number of primitives and vertices </span></span><span><span data-start="1659.0">that may be output. </span></span><span><span data-start="1661.0">These should not be set any larger </span></span><span><span data-start="1663.0">than what your app's geometry, pipeline, and assets </span></span><span><span data-start="1666.0">actually need. </span></span><span><span data-start="1668.0">Being mindful of these sizes will reduce memory traffic </span></span><span><span data-start="1672.0">and may increase occupancy.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="1675.0">If performing per primitive calling in a mesh shader, </span></span><span><span data-start="1678.0">we don't recommend writing vertex positions </span></span><span><span data-start="1680.0">to the mesh object </span></span><span><span data-start="1682.0">just to be called by the hardware subsequent calling stage. </span></span><span><span data-start="1686.0">Instead, it is best to completely omit </span></span><span><span data-start="1689.0">writing such primitives </span></span><span><span data-start="1690.0">as that can save substantial processing time </span></span><span><span data-start="1693.0">in the remainder </span></span><span><span data-start="1694.0">of the hardware's geometry processing stages.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="1699.0">All right, let's recap what I covered

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">
<header>

</header><p>
A few months ago I started a new job at a company that uses Elixir as its main language on the backend. I've never written a line of Elixir or Erlang before in my life, but I've heard a lot about it and Erlang is familiar because I've played around with Prolog for a bit.
</p>

<p>
Thanks to the heavily Ruby-inspired syntax, Elixir was a synch to pick up. I might not be an expert on best practices, architecture, and lower level Erlang concepts yet, but none of this has been a barrier to entry.
</p>

<p>
In fact, I might go as far as saying that Elixir gives you a fun language (like Ruby) while leaving out the stateful footguns OOP languages give you. There are no classes, no instances, no inheritance…it's immutable and functional and you're not bogged down by a static type system.
</p>

<p>
I see this as a benefit because code that holds mutable state is immensely harder to maintain than code that doesn't, and it isn't always clear to a developer if state should be local to a function, to an instance, or to a class. In Ruby you'll tend to get a mix of all three in an attempt to build an intuitive DSL, because literally everything is an object and therefore every object can hold state. It's called an Eigenclass, which is like a class of a class, and every class has one (and is how one instance of a class can mutate the state of every other instance, without knowing about them, by modifying the eigenclass).
</p>

<p>
Speaking of which, Elixir mimics Ruby in its support for DSLs (Domain Specific Languages) too, with a very familiar syntax. The key difference is that Elixir DSLs are compile-time macros and they generate runtime code, whereas Ruby DSLs depend on modifying the runtime by defining objects and methods dynamically.
</p>

<p>
I like this because I don't need to write a test to confirm that I used a library correctly. Either I used the macro wrong and I get an error from the library, or the generated macro was wrong and I get an error from the compiler. All of this happens at compile time, so I can just focus on writing tests on my actual application logic.
</p>

<p>
The pipeline syntax is nice, but I like Clojure's 'threading' operators a lot. They're not related to concurrency, you just have two operators: <code>-&gt;</code> is the same as Elixir's <code>|&gt;</code>, and it inserts the result of the previous expression into the first argument of the next function; <code>-&gt;&gt;</code> in Clojure inserts the same result into the <i>last</i> argument. It seems minor but works great with interop without having to write an anonymous function.
</p>

<p>
I love the <code>with</code> expression, if only because it reminds me of Haskell and Lisp with <code>let</code>, while baking in <code>otherwise</code>. This basically lets you split a complex function in half, with the happy path in the top part and the error handling at the bottom. It works best with a <code>Result</code> tuple because if you can't pattern match on <code>{:ok, result}</code> then you have a recoverable error.
</p>

<p>
Exceptions, then! In Ruby it's common to use exceptions for control flow. It often feels cleaner to do that because it's not common to return explicit error types; usually you either get a successful result or <code>nil</code> or <code>false</code>, and if you're lucky the error state was actually stored in one of the objects you were using. If you call <code>model.update(params)</code> in Ruby, then it returns <code>false</code> if it fails and updates <code>model.errors</code> with what went wrong. Mutable state.
</p>

<p>
I'm happy to see the <code>Result</code> / <code>Either</code> monad get mainstream traction compared to that. Exceptions for exceptional stuff, and a tuple that gives you <code>ok</code> and <code>error</code> as a return value (or <code>left</code> and <code>right</code> with the <code>Either</code> type).
</p>

<p>
I've only scratched the surface really, and I'm sure I'll have more thoughts as I continue to work, but after 3 months of Elixir I have to say that I <i>genuinely</i> enjoy writing it and it carries Ruby's torch of programming being fun.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p>
A common misconception in discussions about typing speed is that
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
any speed above, say, maybe 80 <abbr>wpm</abbr>, isn’t going to hinder anyone when trying to
put anything into the computer
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This particular version comes from <a href="https://bladh.ninja/qwerty.html">an article that’s really about something
else</a>, but I’ve heard it in almost every discussion. Let’s examine it.
</p>

<p>
To be clear, at a steady state in a mature project, I get something like 125
lines of code into production per week. If a line of code corresponds to
something like 10 words, and we divide that by my 35-hour work week<label for="fn.1">1</label><span><sup>1</sup> Bless
Sweden and their generous culture around parental leave.</span>, it would seem like I
can type only one word per minute and still get my job done.
</p>

<p>
But the problem isn’t throughput. If throughput was the concern, most
professionals could get by with far less than 80 words per minute. Even writers
who work in their natural language struggle with producing more than a few pages
per day; counting charitably, that’s less than 5 words per minute.
</p>

<p>
Throughput is not the issue. Latency is.
</p>

<p>
What can we do when we are able to type faster?
</p>

<ul>
<li><p>
Someone writing prose can try multiple ways of shaping their sentences and see
how the sentences interact with each other.
</p>

<p>
When I write articles for this site, I’m sure I produce well over 5× the
content that ends up in the final article, re-writing and re-structuring and
deleting things continuously. This happens very quickly, and I don’t do it
when I write on a touchscreen or with pen-and-paper, because I write too
slowly on those media. Fast typing unlocks this technique.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Someone writing code can think of how to structure the code, then put it down
into code and very quickly move on to think about the next thing. It’s
difficult to type and think at the same time, so any time spent writing is a
pause in thoughts, which can derail the flow.
</p>

<p>
When I write code on a touchscreen or a small keyboard, I find it harder to
keep track of where I’m going next, because it takes so damn long to get a
line of code out of my head and onto the screen.
</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
You can argue that someone writing at 80 words per minute can get a line of
code down in 8 seconds, and learning to write at 120 words per minute will
improve this by a mere three seconds, so what’s the big deal?
</p>

<p>
I don’t have any science to point to, but imagine being forced to sit and do
nothing (not even think!) for three seconds after every five seconds of typing.
That would drive me up the wall!

  <p id="TFcc8B"><em>No Man’s Sky</em> is a game about infinity. It’s not just about having infinite things to do, which is how games often express themselves. It’s a game about being an inhabitant of an infinite universe, an infinitely tiny speck among the stars.</p>
<p id="gMFGZ6"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/8/12/12461520/no-mans-sky-review-ps4-playstation-4-pc-windows-hello-games-sony">At launch, <em>No Man’s Sky</em> was almost lonely</a>, as you moved from one planet to the next in a solitary adventure despite the universe being shared, supposedly, with all of the rest of the players. After an intense cycle of hype and marketing, many players were disappointed to find that their “forever game” felt much smaller than they expected. Other than scanning plants and animals and discovering new planets, there wasn’t much to <em>do</em>.</p>
<p id="F8KOKm">The <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/no-mans-sky/35726"><em>No Man’s Sky</em> of today</a> is nigh unrecognizable compared to the sparse game it was when it launched. The game still boasts the distinctive art direction that initially made it look so appealing — basically any planet you visit looks like the cover of a 1970s science fiction novel. But now the universe is a busy, almost cluttered place. As I play, I get the sense that I will basically never run out of things to do. My base can always be bigger or more beautiful; my small fleet of ships and freighters can only grow; there is always technology to add or upgrade to make my travels run a bit more smoothly. The universe is also very full — everywhere you go is full of life, in the form of alien plants or animals, or aliens on the space waystations in each galaxy, or even other players who can join you in special missions.</p>

<p id="LNkPkv">While I was partial to the emptiness of the original version, the game in its current state is simply a lot more inviting, especially the animals. On the planet where I made my first base in my current save, there were roving bands of creatures that looked like miniature T. rexes with bioluminescence on the backs of their necks. I gave one some Creature Pellets (which I crafted from resources in my surroundings) and they became my animal companion. I can even ride them around, which was useful before I had any exocraft — land vehicles — unlocked.</p>

<p id="5kpOyH">This isn’t to say that <em>No Man’s Sky</em> is some kind of wholly unique experience. If I were particularly cynical, I’d describe it as a science fiction take on <em>Minecraft</em>, because mining and crafting make up the bulk of its activities. You want more fuel for your spaceship? Mine some dihydrogen and craft some launch fuel. Want new parts for your base? Mine some carbon and ferrite dust and then craft them. Want to make your mining multitool more efficient? Most technology requires you to mine and craft something before it can be fully installed. What <em>No Man’s Sky </em>also shares with <em>Minecraft</em> is that it’s largely self-directed. While there are tons of quests, there’s no real urgency behind any of them. If you’d rather ignore them all and just warp out into the unknown universe, there is nothing stopping you. The only things you lose by not following these missions are the free technology and a bit of tutorializing, but maybe you prefer that kind of challenge.</p>
<p id="9jNaRw">While all of these self-directed tasks are on offer, you can also set out to join the constant motion of the universe. Once, spawning into a new galaxy, I got a call for help from a nearby freighter. I’d done this mission before and knew that once I defeated all the enemy ships, the freighter would offer me either a cash reward or ask me to be the new captain of their ship. I gladly accepted the freighter as part of my fleet, and added a science terminal and overseer, which allowed me to finally unlock exocraft. A few galaxies later, another freighter sent me a message — they wanted to join my fleet, for a price. I didn’t have the cash and had to turn them down. After another few warps, I got another incoming message, this time from a single wrecked ship, a recording telling me to “not believe their lies,” with coordinates to a distant galaxy attached. I can investigate, if I want to, or move on and let these characters fend for themselves. But each new warp, each new planet, each new call from a strange signal is another chance to explore the unknown of the universe — and as you keep exploring, you only find how much of this universe is still unknown. </p>

<p id="2O2rWs"><em>No Man’s Sky</em> might be busier, but it’s also never been easier to wrap your head around. While there are a lot of systems built on top of systems, they mostly work in concert with each other. Having a base allows you to follow a quest line that unlocks new technologies from the base computer, which makes exploration easier, which gives you access to better resources, which allows you to craft better technologies, and so on. There are sometimes conflicts between quests that were added later, but the game leans in favor of giving the player <em>more</em>. If two different quests require you to install a personal forcefield, they’ll both give you the upgrade you need, and it only needs to be installed once to be valid for each quest. Once, I could see the game getting confused because I had hired an overseer to work on my freighter instead of my base, and the mission text kept instructing me to return to my base when I needed to go to space. No matter — I could still fulfill everything I needed to do to move on. </p>

<p id="WBERUA">One of the biggest improvements is spaceflight, and especially battles in space. By holding down the left trigger you can now lock on to enemy ships, something that wasn’t available at launch. Actually hitting something has never been easier; in fact, I’ve actually won some space fights where in the past I’d either be exploded by pirates or forced to run away. There appears to be some changes to how the spaceships handle, or maybe I just notice them more now that flying in space feels like less of a chore. One thing that always tickles me is that whenever I brake hard in space, my ship starts going backward. In a game with whispering eggs and laser guns, this little bit of real-world physicality is grounding.</p>
<p id="B0Xy4i">Despite how different the game feels, <em>No Man’s Sky</em> has retained its specificity. While it has much more of the <em>stuff</em> that fills other games, its best part is still what it launched with: seeing new places. In my absence, <em>No Man’s Sky</em> has gotten an abundance of new kinds of places to see. On an airless planet, I watched a meteor shower light up the star-filled sky. On an erupting planet, I dodged between the legs of tall, bipedal creatures in the sweltering heat. On a fractured planet, I found a souvenir — a floating cube that looked like it was made of panes of broken glass. They live in my base now, situated on a hill of a ringed planet overlooking a frigid lake that reflects the sunlight. There may be other views in the universe like mine, but as I build out the base and add new cosmetic items, this one really does feel like it’s <em>mine</em>, my home away from home as I warp across the universe.</p>
<p id="FF6dtT">Whenever I visit the Nexus, the multiplayer hub for <em>No Man’s Sky</em>, I am struck by how inconsequential my journey feels. Seeing those other players, many of whom are much farther along in their journeys and know their way around much better than I, shows me how far I have to go. But <em>No Man’s Sky</em> is a game about that exploration, about chasing new experiences, vistas, sunsets. In an infinite universe you’ll never see everything. But there is a joy in discovering just how small you are among the stars. </p>

Zwar erklärt Microsoft, der Wechsel zurück auf die bisherigen Apps sei jederzeit möglich – die Daten liegen dann aber schon beim Unternehmen.

Auch der Outlook-Client selbst bietet den Test der neuen Outlook-Version mit einem Schalter "Das neue Outlook" an. Die befindet sich noch in der Entwicklung, soll aber 2024 in Windows etwa das Mail-Programm und den mitgelieferten Kalender in Windows ersetzen. In einem <a href="https://translate.google.com/website?sl=de&amp;tl=en&amp;hl=de&amp;u=https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/outlook-blog/things-to-look-forward-to-in-the-new-outlook-for-windows/ba-p/3975602" rel="external noopener" target="_blank">aktuellen Techcommunity-Beitrag erklärt die Microsoft</a>-Angestellte Caitlin Hart zudem, dass auch das klassische Outlook damit ersetzt werden soll.

        <p>Beim Hinzufügen eines Mail-Kontos im neuen Outlook, das nicht von Microsoft gehostet wird, sondern etwa auf Firmen-Mail-Servern liegt, zeigt das Programm einen Hinweis. Er <a href="https://translate.google.com/website?sl=de&amp;tl=en&amp;hl=de&amp;u=https://support.microsoft.com/de-de/office/synchronisieren-ihres-kontos-in-outlook-mit-der-microsoft-cloud-985f9e19-d308-4e85-9d1d-0c6f32f8e981?ui%3Dde-de%26rs%3Dde-de%26ad%3Dde" rel="external noopener" target="_blank">verlinkt auf einen Support-Artikel</a>, der lediglich ausformuliert, dass Nicht-Microsoft-Konten mit der Microsoft-Cloud synchronisiert werden, wobei bislang Gmail-, Yahoo-, iCloud- und IMAP-Konten unterstützt werden. Das macht das neue Outlook auch in den Fassungen für Android, iOS und Mac. Das bedeutet demnach, dass Kopien der "E-Mails, Kalender und Kontakte zwischen Ihrem E-Mail-Anbieter und Microsoft-Rechenzentren synchronisiert" werden. Damit erhält das Unternehmen vollen Zugriff auf alle Mails und kann diese lesen und auswerten. Damit wolle Microsoft Funktionen bereitstellen, die Gmail und IMAP nicht bieten würden.</p> <a-lightbox src="/imgs/18/4/3/3/1/0/1/1/outlook-warnung-e147ccf7fd4368f4.png" tabindex="1">

        <p>Der Hinweis macht stutzig: Was überträgt Microsoft dadurch wohin? Beim Anlegen eines IMAP-Kontos konnte die c't mitschneiden, dass Ziel-Server, Log-in-Name und Passwort an Microsofts Server übertragen werden. Zwar TLS-geschützt, aber im Tunnel laufen die Daten im Klartext zu Microsoft. Ohne darüber zu informieren oder nachzufragen, genehmigt sich Microsoft selbst Vollzugriff auf die IMAP- und SMTP-Zugangsdaten von Nutzern des neuen Outlooks.</p>

        <p>Bei dem Schwenk vom alten Outlook auf das neue wird es parallel dazu installiert. Bislang eingerichtete IMAP-Konten werden nicht übernommen, aber das in Windows hinterlegte Konto schon. Bei der Prüfung mit Google-Konten kam die Authentifizierung mit OAuth2 zum Zuge. Dabei erhalten Nutzerinnen und Nutzer eine Authentifizierungsrückfrage und es landen immerhin keine konkreten Zugangsdaten bei Microsoft, sondern ein Zugriffstoken, den Nutzer auch wieder zurückziehen können.</p> 
        <p>Die Antwort auf unsere Anfrage zu einer Stellungnahme von Microsoft steht noch aus. Zum jetzigen Zeitpunkt müssen wir jedoch davor warnen, unbedacht das neue Outlook auszuprobieren. Neben den ganzen Mails landen dadurch teils sogar Zugangsdaten bei Microsoft.</p> 
        <p>Microsoft fiel bereits <a href="https://www-heise-de.translate.goog/news/Microsoft-IMAP-Umleitung-in-Outlook-nach-Office-Update-jetzt-auch-auf-Macs-7477743.html?_x_tr_sl=de&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=de">Anfang des Jahres mit solchen dreisten Datenumleitungen auf.</a> Nach Office-Updates auf Mac-Rechnern leitete das Outlook dort die Daten ohne etwaige Rückfragen auf Microsofts Cloud-Server um. Damals schaffte Abhilfe, IMAP-Konten zu löschen und neu einzurichten.

            <article itemprop="text"><h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-implementing-tcp--in-rust" dir="auto"><a href="#implementing-tcp--in-rust">Implementing TCP  In Rust</a></h2>
<p dir="auto">Welcome to Implementing TCP in Rust. This is a book with blogpost sized chapters walking you through implementing TCP in Rust. I've been into Rust for a bit, read some books, but nothing beats a real project to make it all click. I was on the lookout for a solid project to sink my teeth into and really get Rust into my fingers. I discovered <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@jonhoo" rel="nofollow">Jon Gjengset's</a> epic live stream of building a TCP stack in Rust. Watching him work through the process was a game-changer for me, and honestly, this book wouldn't have happened without his streams as a starting point.</p>
<p dir="auto">At first, this book was just a set of notes for me to refer back to. But then it hit me – why not flesh these notes out into something more substantial? Jon's streams are gold - they're incredibly in-depth and he explains his every move and thought for hours(The three videos on TCP were for about 14 hours). But I get it, not everyone can or wants to commit to that length of video content.</p>
<p dir="auto">So here's what I've got: a book inspired by Jon's marathon sessions, condensed into a compact format for the rest of us. It's for anyone who prefers reading and doing over watching.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-what-are-we-building" dir="auto"><a href="#what-are-we-building">What Are We Building?</a></h3>
<p dir="auto">In this book, we embark on a  journey to build a user space TCP stack in Rust, grounded in the specifications of <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc793" rel="nofollow">RFC 793</a>. The TCP stack is an implementation that lives entirely in user space, as opposed to being part of the operating system kernel. This choice offers us an opportunity to understand and tinker with network programming without delving into kernel development.</p>
<p dir="auto">Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a fundamental protocol that forms the backbone of the internet. It is what allows us to send and receive data with the assurance of reliability and order. Without TCP, the internet as we know it—complete with the seamless sending of emails, files, and the browsing of websites—would be untenable. TCP guarantees that packets of data arrive at their destination correctly and in the same order they were sent, providing essential services such as data sequencing, error detection, and correction through retransmissions.</p>
<p dir="auto">I encourage you to read <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc793" rel="nofollow">RFC 793</a>. It is very straightforward and most of what we will be discussing in the coming chapters is based off it.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-how-to-read-this-book" dir="auto"><a href="#how-to-read-this-book">How To Read This book</a></h3>
<p dir="auto">This is the order in which to read this book:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><a href="https://github.com/Ghvstcode/Rust-Tcp/blob/main/chapter1/chapter1.md#the-kernel-user-space-divide">Chapter 1 - The Kernel-User Space Divide</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Ghvstcode/Rust-Tcp/blob/main/chapter2/chapter2.md#parsing-the-bits">Chapter 2 - Parsing The Bits</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Ghvstcode/Rust-Tcp/blob/main/chapter3/chapter3.md#the-connection-quad">Chapter 3 - The connection Quad</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Ghvstcode/Rust-Tcp/blob/main/chapter4/chapter4.md#the-final-handshake">Chapter 4 - The Final Handshake</a></li>
<li>Chapter 5(coming soon)</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">I have deliberately not included complete code samples within the book, to nudge you towards active learning—writing the code yourself rather than copying it. But don’t worry, each chapter is paired with a relevant commit link to Jon's repository, where you can check your work. If I get <a href="https://github.com/Ghvstcode/Rust-Tcp/issues/new">requests</a> to include code samples to each chapter then I shall consider doing so.</p>
<p dir="auto">By the end of this book, you will have a working TCP stack that you can use to understand and explore the lower levels of network programming. You will gain practical knowledge in Rust and a deeper appreciation for the protocols that power the internet. This book will serve not only as a guide to implementing RFC 793 but also as a testament to the power and capabilities of Rust in systems programming.</p>

                                        <p>SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) — The Illinois Senate approved <span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/illinois-nuclear-reactor-moratorium-7646499fdbed1dadde25c7b475b2e29f" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lifting a 36-year-old moratorium</a></span> on new nuclear power installments on Wednesday in a plan proponents say will ensure the state can meet its carbon-free power production promise by 2045.</p><p>The Senate’s 44-7 endorsement opens the door for <span><a href="https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/fulltext.asp?DocName=10300HB2473sam003&amp;GA=103&amp;SessionId=112&amp;DocTypeId=HB&amp;LegID=147557&amp;DocNum=2473&amp;GAID=17&amp;SpecSess=&amp;Session=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cutting-edge nuclear technology</a></span> in so-called small modular reactors, designed to sit on sites for which they produce power, such as large factories. </p><p>Environmentalists have criticized the plan, noting that small modular reactors are a decade or more from viability. Sponsoring Sen. Sue Rezin, a Republican from Morris, said that’s the reason, coupled with a federal permitting process of as much as eight years, her legislation is timely. </p>
    

<p>“If we want to take advantage of the amazing advancements in new nuclear technology that have occurred over the past couple of decades and not fall behind the rest of the states, we need to act now,” Rezin said. </p>



<p>The House has through Thursday — the scheduled adjournment of the General Assembly’s fall session — to OK the proposal and send it to Gov. J.B. Pritzker. </p>
<p>Under the legislation, Illinois would allow development of small modular reactors in January 2026. That’s when a report on necessary safety measures and updated guidelines would be due. </p><p>The plan also tasks the Illinois Emergency Management Agency with oversight of newly installed reactors. Rezin added that layer of inspection, despite her contention that strict federal control is sufficient, to appease a concerned Pritzker. The Democrat cited the issue as one that caused him to side with environmentalists and veto initial legislation Rezin saw approved overwhelmingly last spring. </p><p>Just over two years ago, Pritzker signed a law requiring the state to use only <span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/technology-climate-business-electric-vehicles-illinois-106a47b73989384d09e757b5715b19ec" target="_blank" rel="noopener">carbon-free electricity by 2045</a></span>. That means closing numerous coal-fired power plants and investing heavily in wind and solar energy. It also included a $700 million bailout to keep afloat two unprofitable nuclear plants in the state, validating for Rezin and other supporters that nuclear power must remain part of the picture. </p><p>“As we move toward a clean energy future and we start taking certain types of energy offline, we have to have something to replace all those megawatts,” said Sen. Patrick Joyce, a Reddick Democrat. “As technology changes, we need to make sure that we change with it.”</p>

In May at NYU Langone Health in New York City, the surgery was performed on a 46-year-old man who had suffered severe electrical burns to his face, left eye and left arm. He does not yet have vision in the transplanted eye and may never regain it there, but early evidence suggests the eye itself is healthy and may be capable of transmitting neurological signals to the brain.</p>

<p>The feat opens up the possibility of restoring the appearance—and maybe even sight—of people who have been disfigured or blinded by injuries. Researchers caution there are many technical hurdles before such a procedure can effectively treat vision loss, however.</p>

<p>“I think it’s an important proof of principle,” says Jeffrey Goldberg, a professor and chair of ophthalmology at the Byers Eye Institute at Stanford University, who was not involved in the surgery but has been part of a team working toward whole-eye transplants in humans. “I think it points to the opportunity and importance that we really stand on the verge of being able to [achieve] eye transplants and vision restoration for<strong> </strong>blind<strong> </strong>patients more broadly.”<strong> </strong>But he cautions that the main obstacle is achieving regeneration of the optic nerve, which carries visual signals from the retina to the brain; this step has not yet been successfully demonstrated in humans.</p>

<p>Face and <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/she-has-his-eyes-does-gender-matter-in-cornea-transplants/">cornea transplants</a> have been performed before, yet to the NYU Langone team’s knowledge, this is the first time a whole eye has been transplanted successfully (with or without a face). The <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8420670/">first partial face transplant</a> was performed in 2005 in France. As of 2021, nearly 50 face transplants had been conducted worldwide. In 1969 Texas physician Conard Moore <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35038417/">claimed to have attempted the first whole-eye transplant</a> in a human, but it was not successful. Amid criticism, Moore later retracted his claim, saying he had only transplanted the eye’s outer portion—the sclera and cornea. Although a subsequent analysis suggested he may, in fact, have transplanted the whole eye, it did not develop a blood supply.</p>

<p>The recent transplant was performed by Eduardo Rodriguez, director of the face transplant program and chair of the department of plastic surgery at NYU Langone Health, and his colleagues. The recipient was Arkansas-based military veteran Aaron&nbsp;James, whose face touched a live wire while he was working as an electrical lineman in Oklahoma in June 2021. The accident left him with severe burns to the left side of his face, including his left eye, nose and lips, and extensive damage to his left arm, his dominant limb. James was transferred to a hospital in Texas, where he received multiple reconstructive surgeries. His left eye was removed because it was causing pain, and his left arm was amputated above the elbow and fitted with a prosthetic hook. He was in a medical coma for six weeks and he says he doesn’t remember anything from the accident and afterward until he woke up at the hospital.</p>

<p>Two months after the accident, Rodriguez and his colleagues at NYU Langone Health became aware of James’s case. Over the next year they discussed the possibility of a face transplant with Aaron James and his wife, Meagan. The decision was made to transplant the donor’s eye as well, because even if James never regained sight, the organ would help restore his face’s appearance. Like any transplant, there was a chance his immune system would reject the eye—but he would already need to take immunosuppressant medication for the face transplant.</p>

<p>James was added to a transplant waiting list in February 2023, and on Memorial Day weekend in May a donor was identified: a deceased man in his 30s whose family consented to donate his organs. James and his family flew to New York City for the operation, which took place on May 27. The portions of the face that were transplanted included the nose, left eyelids and eyebrow, lips, underlying skull, nasal and chin bones, cheekbones, and all of the muscle and nerve tissue under the right eye. The entire left eye and optic nerve were transplanted, and stem cells from the donor’s bone marrow were transplanted along with them in the hopes of helping the optic nerve regenerate. The surgery itself lasted 21 hours and involved more than 140 people, including doctors, nurses and support staff.</p>

<p>James has since made a good recovery. He is able to talk, and although he does not have much ability to move his lips and facial muscles yet, Rodriguez says he will recover a lot of that ability with time. He can eat food on his own again now, and his wife Meagan says he has a big appetite. James was even able to attend his daughter’s high school graduation, and he says keeping his sense of humor has been critical to his recovery.</p>

</figure>

<p>Rodriguez and the rest of the surgical team are very pleased with James’s recovery. “Everything that we’re seeing so far, no one expected,” he says. “Even if we don’t get sight, I will tell you at this point in time, everything seems incredibly exciting.”</p>

<p>As of six months post-transplantation, James does not yet report any vision in the transplanted eye. But measurements show the eye is receiving good blood flow and is maintaining normal ocular pressure, according to Vaidehi Dedania, an associate professor in the department of ophthalmology at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine, who has been involved in monitoring the health of the donor eye.</p>

<p>“We ensured that the eye from the donor was in excellent health prior to the transplantation,” Dedania says. About nine days post-transplantation, “we were able to see that the blood is pumping through the eye and really getting a good flow and good oxygen to the entire retina through the retinal circulation. And that was really, really remarkable,” she adds.</p>

<p>Cross-sectional imaging of the donated eye’s macula (the central part of the retina) showed it was thinner after the transplant—but this had been expected because the blood supply had been necessarily disrupted, and a fair number of photoreceptors—light-sensitive cells in the retina—were still present, Dedania says. The photoreceptors appear to be responsive to light in preliminary tests. The medical team plans to conduct more rigorous follow-up testing soon to confirm this, however.</p>

<p>“The current studies seem to indicate that there’s the possibility of some communication between the [eye] and the brain,” says Rodriguez, who declined to comment further on preliminary findings that his team has submitted to a journal for publication. “However, we would like to validate that further, with a higher-fidelity piece of equipment by a nationally recognized expert.”</p>

<p>Scientists have been working toward whole-eye transplantation for many years. “This has been, I would say, science fiction for a long time,” says José-Alain Sahel, a professor and chair of the department of ophthalmology at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, who has been working toward such transplants with Goldberg and others. Progress in surgical techniques and nerve regeneration have made this goal seem more attainable. Although eye transplants have been done <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/eye2016272">in rodents</a> with some success, the animals’ eyes are much smaller and less vascularized than those of humans. Goldberg and his team have done some research on pig eyes, which are more similar to humans’, but optic nerve regeneration remains a challenge.</p>

<p>“The fact that this surgery was successful is wonderful news,” Sahel says. He cautions that surgery is only a small part of the issues that need to be addressed in order to restore eye function, however. These include making sure the immune system doesn’t reject the donor eye, which is a challenge with any type of transplant. Then the corneal nerve—which carries sensory signals from the transparent part of the eye—must be reconnected. Yet the most complex part is regenerating the optic nerve. In order to do so, surgeons have to coax the nerve fibers to grow to the right place, which Sahel says could take months or even years. And complete optic nerve regeneration has not yet been successfully achieved in humans or other mammals.</p>

<p>Even if the optic nerve can regrow, there is the question of whether the brain will be able to interpret the signals from the transplanted eye. The brain has a lot of plasticity, so there is some reason to hope it may be able to adapt to the new input. Until these questions are addressed, “I’m doubtful that you will get a successful transplant in terms of restoring function,” Sahel says, adding, “I’m looking forward to seeing more results in this patient.”</p></div><section><h3>ABOUT THE AUTHOR(S)</h3><section><p><img src="https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/91556F8B-189C-4F0F-82DC8929AFCD4E55_small.png?h=65&amp;w=65" alt="author-avatar" width="65" height="65"></p><div><ul></ul><p><strong>Tanya Lewis</strong> is a senior editor covering health and medicine at <em>Scientific American</em>.

                                                                        <figure><a href="https://cdn.neowin.com/news/images/uploaded/2023/11/1699472650_onedrive_prompt.jpg"><img alt="A prompt asking you to explain your decision to quit OneDrive in Windows 11" src="https://cdn.neowin.com/news/images/uploaded/2023/11/1699472650_onedrive_prompt_story.jpg"></a></figure><p>A few weeks ago, we reported an odd discovery in Microsoft Edge: a poll asking users to <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/microsoft-now-wants-you-to-take-a-poll-before-installing-google-chrome/">explain their decision to download Chrome</a>. A similar thing is now haunting OneDrive users on Windows, <em>demanding</em> to answer why they are closing the app. And demanding is a correct word here because Windows will not let you quit OneDrive without answering first.</p>

<p>Here are the options the app lets you pick:</p>

<ul>
<li>I do not want OneDrive running all the time</li>
	<li>I do not know what OneDrive is</li>
	<li>I do not use OneDrive</li>
	<li>I am trying to fix a problem with OneDrive</li>
	<li>I am trying to speed up my computer</li>
	<li>I get too many notifications</li>
	<li>Other</li>
</ul>                            <!-- PLACE THIS SECTION INSIDE OF YOUR BODY WHERE YOU WANT THE VIDEO PLAYER TO RENDER -->
            <p>Sadly, there is no "none of your business, let me quit" option.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.neowin.com/news/images/uploaded/2023/11/1699472645_onedrive_prompt_1.jpg"><img alt="A prompt asking you to explain your decision to quit OneDrive in Windows 11" src="https://cdn.neowin.com/news/images/uploaded/2023/11/1699472645_onedrive_prompt_1_story.jpg"></a></figure><p>The updated "Quit OneDrive" dialog with its poll is just another Microsoft attempt to impose its services, and discovering similar "ads" across Windows and other products takes only a few clicks. Here are some examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Settings app will prompt you to enable OneDrive backup when changing your Windows background. <em>"</em><em>Back up your Pictures folder to automatically back up your background image."</em>
</li>
	<li>File Explorer shows a flashing backup button in user folders. Tip: close OneDrive to make it disappear.</li>
	<li>
<a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/microsoft-is-now-pushing-ads-and-promos-in-windows-11-start-menu-but-you-can-disable-them/">Backup notifications in the Start menu</a>.</li>
	<li>Backup notifications in Office apps when saving files locally (how could you dare not save your files in OneDrive).</li>
	<li>And multiple notifications from the OneDrive app itself.</li>
</ul>
<p>The new OneDrive dialog is available in version 23.214.1015.0001 (Stable build). If you want, you can update your OneDrive client by downloading its executable <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/onedrive/download">from the official website</a>. If not, the app will update itself automatically whenever it feels like doing so.</p>

<p>Forcing customers to explain their actions may not look like the deadliest sin, but it does not make user experience any better or more convenient either. Next time, Microsoft might ask you to explain turning off your computer.</p>
                        
                        
                                                                    </div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://corrode.dev/why-rust/">https://corrode.dev/why-rust/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38207959">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img src="https://corrode.dev/why-rust/hero.svg" alt="Why Rust?"></p><p>Interest in Rust has surged in recent years, with tech leaders such as
Microsoft, Google, and Amazon coming forward to share their experiences of
leveraging Rust for critical systems.</p>
<p>Much of the dialogue about Rust, however, is still driven by those who have not
leveraged Rust in a significant production capacity or have only done so for
non-critical systems. This results in a skewed understanding of Rust's
application in production settings, especially for small and medium-sized
businesses, where discussions tend to highlight performance benefits and gloss
over other crucial aspects.</p>
<p>In my role as a Rust consultant, I have had the opportunity to engage with many
companies, both large and small. I found that companies value productivity,
stability, and long-term maintainability over performance.</p>
<p>Much of my Rust consultancy is under NDA, so I use public data and surveys to
back my insights. I'm working with past clients to share more in the future.</p>
<p>This overview distills key insights, offering a resource for businesses to
assess whether Rust is the right tool for their use-case or not.</p>
<p>The intent is to provide an honest look at Rust's practicality for production
to help decision-makers understand its benefits and challenges.</p>
<h2 id="reasons-for-using-rust-in-production">Reasons For Using Rust In Production</h2>
<h3 id="reliability-and-stability">Reliability and Stability</h3>
<p>From experience, the majority of companies care less about uncompromising
performance and more about <a href="https://talks.osfc.io/osfc2021/talk/JTWYEH/">reliability and
stability</a> of their services. More
predictable and stable services are easier to maintain and cheaper to operate.
Less time is spent on debugging and on-call, and more time on building new
features. Scaling services is also easier when you know how systems behave under
load. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Given our small team size, infrastructure reliability is crucial, otherwise,
maintenance starves innovation. Rust provides us with confidence that any code
modification or refactor is likely to produce working programs that will run for
months with minimal supervision. - <a href="https://x.ai/">xAI (formerly Twitter)</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://deepsource.com/blog/exponential-cost-of-fixing-bugs">Bugs cost more to fix the later they are found.</a>
Below is the relative cost of fixing bugs at various stages of the development lifecycle.
Bugs found in production are significantly more expensive to fix than bugs found
during development. (Source: NIST <a href="https://www.nist.gov/system/files/documents/director/planning/report02-3.pdf">Costs of Software Defects</a>)</p>
<p><img src="https://corrode.dev/why-rust/bug-costs.svg" alt="Cost of fixing bugs over time"></p><p>In a survey, <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/blog/2019/07/a-proactive-approach-to-more-secure-code/">Microsoft found that 70% of their bugs are due to memory safety
issues</a>.
Rust couldn't have prevented all of these bugs, but it would have drastically
reduced the total amount. 
Rust's strong type system and its borrow checker allow you to <a href="https://kerkour.com/bugs-rust-compiler-helps-prevent">catch bugs
earlier in the development lifecycle, typically at compile-time</a> (instead of
runtime as in languages with less stringent type systems or static analysis
capabilities). This results in real cost savings for companies.</p>
<p>As requirements grow, Rust is a great language for building larger applications
that are maintained by a bigger team over a long period of time. This is due to
its strong type system, its focus on memory safety, its powerful tooling (cargo,
rustfmt, clippy, etc.) and its stability guarantees (backwards compatibility)
due to its edition system. All of that makes large-scale refactoring easier.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We always talk about the performance gains [...] when using Rust but honestly I
much more look for the stability gains. - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTJIsicwW5s">Stefan Baumgartner, Senior Product Architect at Dynatrace</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="predictable-runtime-behavior">Predictable Runtime Behavior</h3>
<p>Predictable runtime behavior is closely related to reliability and stability.
It means that services run smoothly without any hiccups. This is especially
important for latency-sensitive services like games, chat applications, or
services that need to act on real-time data.</p>
<p>Smooth operation is of uppermost importance for organizations as it is a
significant cost factor and can impact customer satisfaction. According to a 
<a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/on-call-cloud-operations-cost-organizations-an-average-of-2-5-million-per-year/">recent
study</a>,
organizations are spending an average of $2.5 million per year on on-call
operations. <a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/oncall-compensation/">Compensation for on-call
engineers</a> is a big
part of that cost.</p>
<p>Discord has a <a href="https://discord.com/blog/why-discord-is-switching-from-go-to-rust">great
article</a>
about why they switched from Go to Rust. They mention that Go's garbage
collector was a source of unpredictable latency spikes. After switching to Rust,
they were able to fully get rid of garbage collection and have a more
predictable runtime behavior.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When we started load testing, we were instantly pleased with the results. The
latency of the Rust version was just as good as Go’s and had no latency spikes!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is a diagram from the above article by Discord.
Notice how the latency spikes in the Go version are gone in the Rust version
and how that impacts the 95th percentile response time, making it much more
predictable and smooth.</p>
<p><img src="https://corrode.dev/why-rust/discord.png" alt="Discord Go vs Rust"></p><p>Another example is
<a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/big-pineapple-intro/">Cloudflare</a>,
which uses Rust to power their DNS service, <a href="https://1.1.1.1/">1.1.1.1</a>. They
mention that Rust's predictable runtime behavior is a big reason for using it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the things we’ve learned with the previous implementations is that, for
a service open to the public, a peak performance of the I/O matters less than
the ability to pace clients fairly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, Rust shows excellent runtime behavior when handling network requests.
In a <a href="https://medium.com/star-gazers/benchmarking-low-level-i-o-c-c-rust-golang-java-python-9a0d505f85f7">benchmark by Eugene Retunsky</a>, Rust had the lowest tail latency and maximum throughput next to C and C++. </p>
<p>Here is the diagram from the benchmark, showing the p99.9 latency for each
language under test. As the requests per second increase, the latency for Rust
stays low and stable. Go and Java on the other hand have a higher baseline
latency while Python shows latency spikes at a certain point.</p>
<p><img src="https://corrode.dev/why-rust/runtime.png" alt="Rust Runtime behavior"></p><p>The author concludes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, Rust has a much lower latency variance than Golang, Python, and especially Java. 
[...] Rust might be a better alternative to Golang, Java, or Python if predictable performance is crucial for your service. Also, before starting to write a new service in C or C++, it’s worth considering Rust. - <a href="https://medium.com/star-gazers/benchmarking-low-level-i-o-c-c-rust-golang-java-python-9a0d505f85f7">Eugene Retunsky</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="cost-savings">Cost Savings</h3>
<p>We touched on cost savings already, but its significance warrants a dedicated
section.</p>
<p>Rust has a low runtime overhead. This is especially important for services that
need to scale to handle a large number of requests.
It can save a lot of money on cloud infrastructure costs if the same workload
can be handled with fewer resources.</p>
<p>For example, AWS has a service called
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/firecracker-lightweight-virtualization-for-serverless-computing/">Firecracker</a>,
which runs virtual machines with very low overhead. It powers AWS Lambda functions and AWS Fargate containers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Firecracker consumes about 5 MiB of memory per microVM. You can run thousands
of secure VMs with widely varying vCPU and memory configurations on the same
instance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The better hardware utilization translates to lower costs for companies.</p>
<p>Firecracker allowed AWS to improve the efficiency of Fargate, which passed on
cost savings to customers. As a result, they were able to reduce the price of Fargate by
up to 50%. 
(<a href="https://shahbhargav.medium.com/firecracker-secure-and-fast-microvms-628e6043b572">Image source</a> and
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/aws-fargate-price-reduction-up-to-50/">AWS announcement</a>)</p>
<p><img src="https://corrode.dev/why-rust/fargate.png" alt="Firecracker"></p><h3 id="ergonomics">Ergonomics</h3>
<p>Rust has great developer ergonomics. Its expressive type system allows
developers to model their domain in a way that lets the compiler help with
writing correct code.</p>
<p>Furthermore, functional concepts like pattern matching, enums, <code>Result</code> and <code>Option</code> types
allow for concise and expressive code.</p>
<p>Rust's robust error handling story, which requires the programmer to explicitly handle
errors, is a big reason for its reliability.</p>
<p>All these features make it easier to write correct code, reduce the cognitive
load on developers and catch bugs at compile-time instead of runtime.
Static analysis <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shift-left_testing">shifts the quality assurance of code to the left</a>:</p>
<p><img src="https://corrode.dev/why-rust/robustness.svg" alt="Bug detection over time"></p><blockquote>
<p>Rust has been a force multiplier for our team, and betting on Rust was one of
the best decisions we made. More than performance, its ergonomics and focus on
correctness has helped us tame sync’s complexity. We can encode complex
invariants about our system in the type system and have the compiler check them
for us. - <a href="https://dropbox.tech/infrastructure/rewriting-the-heart-of-our-sync-engine">Dropbox</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>An often mentioned benefit of Rust is the possibility to refactor code without
fear. This should not be underestimated as it allows you to improve your
codebase over time and make it more robust. Especially for applications that use
multi-threading, this is a big advantage as <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2015/04/10/Fearless-Concurrency.html">typical error scenarios of
concurrent programming are detected by the
compiler</a>.</p>
<h3 id="focus-on-long-term-sustainability">Focus on Long-Term Sustainability</h3>
<p>Companies rarely rewrite their services in another language. It incurs a lot of costs
and risks. Only if a rewrite promises a <em>significant</em> upside, companies will
consider it.</p>
<p>One well-known company that started to heavily invest in Rust is Microsoft.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Microsoft is going big on Rust and spending $10 million to make it 1st class
language in our engineering systems + $1 million @rustlang foundation. - <a href="https://twitter.com/dwizzzleMSFT/status/1720134540822520268">David Weston, Vice President of OS Security and Enterprise at Microsoft</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Microsoft even <a href="https://twitter.com/markrussinovich/status/1656416376125538304">integrated Rust into the Windows kernel</a>.
The fact that they take big bets on Rust shows that they are in it
for the long run. This is a good sign for the Rust ecosystem, as the backing of
a large company can help Rust to become more mainstream and ensure
long-term sustainability.</p>
<p>Similarly, <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/next/rust/index.html">the Linux kernel now supports Rust</a>
as well.
The Kernel incorporating Rust is a major endorsement of the language. Notably,
the Linux Kernel maintainers have previously <a href="http://harmful.cat-v.org/software/c++/linus">refused to integrate C++ in the Kernel</a>.</p>
<p>In a landmark development for Rust, the open source <a href="https://ferrous-systems.com/blog/officially-qualified-ferrocene/">Ferrocene
toolchain</a> has
achieved a significant milestone: Ferrocene, based on Rust 1.68, is now ISO
26262 and IEC 61508 qualified. This certification means that the Rust compiler
meets rigorous safety standards, making it fully usable in safety-critical
environments like automotive or avionics. Few other languages have
achieved this level of certification. It is another strong signal that Rust is
here to stay.</p>
<p>For another take on this, watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnIWRks35Fk">"In It for the Long
Haul"</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/carols10cents">Carol
Nichols</a>.</p>
<h3 id="productivity-and-developer-happiness">Productivity And Developer Happiness</h3>
<p>Many developers enjoy working with Rust. It is the most admired language for the
6th year in a row according to the <a href="https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/#section-admired-and-desired-programming-scripting-and-markup-languages">StackOverflow Developer Survey</a>.
More than 80% of developers that use it want to use it again next year.</p>
<p>For teams that are looking to hire and retain talent, Rust is a great choice
because developer happiness is a big factor in job satisfaction and has a positive
impact on productivity.</p>
<h3 id="performance-and-energy-efficiency">Performance And Energy Efficiency</h3>
<p>As stated earlier, performance often gets mentioned as a main reason for using Rust.
Rust also has great support for multi-threaded workloads. Libraries like
<a href="https://github.com/rayon-rs/rayon">rayon</a> and <a href="https://tokio.rs/">Tokio</a> are considered
best-in-class for writing high-performance applications.</p>
<p>Making efficient use of compute resources has much deeper implications for
companies than just raw execution speed. One important aspect is energy efficiency.</p>
<p>In the below benchmark, taken from <a href="https://greenlab.di.uminho.pt/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/sleFinal.pdf">"Energy Efficiency across Programming Languages"</a>
by Pereira et al., Rust has superior runtime performance on par with C and C++
and faster than Go by a factor of 2-3x as well as Python by a factor of 70x.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Lang</th><th>Time (Normalized)</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>C</td><td>1.00</td></tr>
<tr><td>Rust</td><td>1.04</td></tr>
<tr><td>C++</td><td>1.56</td></tr>
<tr><td>Java</td><td>1.89</td></tr>
<tr><td>Go</td><td>2.83</td></tr>
<tr><td>JavaScript</td><td>6.52</td></tr>
<tr><td>PHP</td><td>27.64</td></tr>
<tr><td>Ruby</td><td>59.34</td></tr>
<tr><td>Python</td><td>71.90</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>This translates to lower energy consumption as well. 
Energy is another important cost factor for companies at scale.</p>
<p><img src="https://corrode.dev/why-rust/energy-consumption.svg" alt="Energy Efficiency across Programming Languages"></p><h2 id="reasons-against-using-rust-in-production">Reasons Against Using Rust In Production</h2>
<h3 id="immature-ecosystem">Immature ecosystem</h3>
<p>Rust is a relatively young language. Version 1.0 was first released in 2015.
This means that the ecosystem is still maturing. Many important libraries <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/11byl6u/why_is_every_crate_pre10/">did not see their 1.0 release yet</a>.</p>
<p>This phenomenon has been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/11byl6u/why_is_every_crate_pre10/ja3auop/">brought up as a reason to be cautious when using Rust in production</a>.</p>
<p>In practice, it might be hard to find production-grade libraries for specific
needs. Your team might be required to write custom crates or improve existing
ones. Furthermore, <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/explore?ecosystem=RUST">sponsoring open source maintainers</a> to work on critical
dependencies is a good way to ensure that the long-term sustainability of the
ecosystem.</p>
<p>That said, libraries for common tasks like JSON parsing or network handling are
very robust and stable and considered best-in-class. Breaking changes are rare
and important crates like <code>serde</code> or <code>tokio</code> are already past their 1.0 release.</p>
<p>A relatively recent addition to the Rust ecosystem is async/await support, a
feature designed to streamline the writing of concurrent applications. This support
represents a significant evolution in Rust's capabilities, but it is still
in its early stages.
If you're planning to write network applications in Rust, there is a high chance
that you will need to use async/await. As such it's important to stay on top of
its ongoing development and limitations. For a detailed exploration of where
async/await in Rust stands today, including its practical implications, we
invite you to read our comprehensive post detailing the current <a href="https://corrode.dev/blog/async/">state of
async/await in Rust</a>.</p>
<h3 id="lack-of-developers">Lack Of Developers</h3>
<p>Related to the previous point, the Rust community is still relatively small.
It is hard to find developers with professional Rust experience. </p>
<p>From talking to companies that use Rust in production, I found that they are
mostly training their developers on the job.
Moreover, Rust is noted for enabling a smooth onboarding process for engineers
already proficient in languages like C++ or Java.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Rust developers are generally very passionate about their
craft and are actively seeking out jobs that allow them to use Rust,
so the market for Rust developers is growing. (Also see
the previous section about developer happiness.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rust has more than tripled the size of its community over the past two years
and currently has 3.7M users, of which 0.6M joined in the last six months
alone.[...] Furthermore, Rust has built a loyal community of developers who care
about memory safety and security. - <a href="https://www.developernation.net/resources/reports/state-of-the-developer-nation-24th-edition-q1-2023">State of the Developer Nation 24th Edition - Q1 2023 report</a></p>

<img src="https://corrode.dev/why-rust/communities.svg" alt="Programming Language Communities Size">
</a></p><h3 id="tooling">Tooling</h3>
<p>Cargo, rustfmt, clippy, and rust-analyzer
are all great tools that make Rust development a joy. 
However, <a href="https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/debugging-support-in-rustc.html">debugging support is still lacking</a>.
<a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/devecosystem-2021/rust/">The story for profiling support is similar.</a></p>
<p>Recently, <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/rust/">JetBrains announced RustRover</a>,
a new IDE for Rust which is based on IntelliJ.
This is a strong signal that JetBrains sees it as a good investment to build
tooling for Rust developers and that they expect Rust to become more mainstream.</p>
<h3 id="learning-curve">Learning Curve</h3>
<p>Rust has a famously steep learning curve. It is a complex language with many
advanced features. </p>
<p>When asked why they don't use Rust, participants of the <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2023/08/07/Rust-Survey-2023-Results.html#rust-usage">2022 Annual Rust Survey</a>
mentioned the learning curve as the main reason:</p>
<p><img src="https://corrode.dev/why-rust/why-not-rust.svg" alt="Why not Rust?"></p><p>In the <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2020/12/16/rust-survey-2020.html#improved-learnability">Rust 2020
survey</a>,
participants were asked to rate the difficulty of various Rust concepts. Here
are the results:</p>
<p><img src="https://corrode.dev/why-rust/topic-difficulty-ratings.svg" alt="Difficulty by topic"></p><p>Lifetime annotations, ownership, and borrowing were mentioned as the most
difficult topics to grasp. In real-world applications, lifetimes
are less of an issue, however, as the compiler can often infer them through
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/lifetime-elision.html">lifetime elision</a>.
Ownership and borrowing however are crucial concepts in Rust that need to be 
understood to become proficient.</p>
<p>It is important to set clear expectations for your team when adopting Rust: Rust
is not a language that you can learn in a few days. It requires practice to internalize
the concepts around ownership and borrowing to become productive with it.
Typically, it takes a few months to become productive with Rust:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Based on our studies, more than 2/3 of respondents are confident in
contributing to a Rust codebase within two months or less when learning Rust.
Further, a third of respondents become as productive using Rust as other
languages in two months or less. <strong>Within four months, that number increased to
over 50%.</strong> - <a href="https://opensource.googleblog.com/2023/06/rust-fact-vs-fiction-5-insights-from-googles-rust-journey-2022.html">Google</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Microsoft shared a <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/blog/2020/04/the-safety-boat-kubernetes-and-rust/">similar experience</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>It takes several weeks of hard effort</strong> learning how to code properly in Rust
before the learning curve levels out. However, that hard effort up front pays
off in dividends due to the aforementioned safety features. We also noticed that
once developers are over that initial curve, they are able to contribute to code
just as easily as with any other language. Just be aware that there will be some
initial pain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Depending on your immediate needs, this might be a deal-breaker for your team.
Other languages like Go or Python have a much lower learning curve and are
a better fit for rapid prototyping.</p>
<h3 id="compile-times">Compile Times</h3>
<p>Rust has a reputation for having long compile times. This is especially true for
large projects with many dependencies.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Slow build speeds were by far the #1 reported challenge that developers have
when using Rust, with only a little more than 40% of respondents finding the
speed acceptable. - <a href="https://opensource.googleblog.com/2023/06/rust-fact-vs-fiction-5-insights-from-googles-rust-journey-2022.html">Google</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rapid iteration is important for developers. Long compile times can be a
productivity killer. This is most noticeable for developers that are used to
languages like Go or Python, where the feedback loop is much faster.</p>
<p>Compile times are a known issue and the Rust team is <a href="https://nnethercote.github.io/2023/03/24/how-to-speed-up-the-rust-compiler-in-march-2023.html">continously working on improving them</a>.
And these incremental improvements are paying off. The Rust compiler is getting
faster over time:</p>
<p><img src="https://corrode.dev/why-rust/compile-times.svg" alt="Rust Compile Times Over Time"></p><p>For advice on how to improve compile times, see <a href="https://endler.dev/2020/rust-compile-times/">my article on this topic</a> with many practical tips.
For medium-sized projects, compile times are less of an issue. 
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/qgi421/doing_m1_macbook_pro_m1_max_64gb_compile/">Modern hardware can also mitigate the issue to some extent.</a></p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Rust is a great language for building large-scale, reliable, and stable
applications. It is a good fit for companies that value productivity and
developer happiness and see it as a long-term investment.</p>
<p>On the other side, Rust is still a young language and the ecosystem is still
maturing. It has a steep learning curve and long compile times.</p>
<p>These challenges are not insurmountable, however. They require a commitment to
Rust and a willingness to invest in training and tooling.</p>
<p>Navigating the decision to integrate Rust into your technology stack is pivotal
and requires thoughtful consideration. Should you find yourself weighing its
benefits against your specific requirements, professional guidance can prove
invaluable. Equally, if you are ready to embrace Rust and are seeking expertise
in training or consulting to ensure a smooth transition, specialized support is
essential.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="2.0">Sometimes, as ProPublica has reported, insurers base decisions on what’s good for the company’s bottom line rather than what’s good for the patient’s health. Sometimes, insurers make mistakes. In one case we learned about, a company denied a child’s treatment because it based its judgment on adult guidelines instead of pediatric ones. In another, an internal reviewer misread what type of surgery the patient sought and denied coverage based on that error.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="8.0">Our team discovered how useful claim files can be after a patient shared internal notes and calculations that a health insurer had made about his case.

We also <a href="https://propublica.jotform.com/231996124151859">shared resources with health care providers</a> and patient advocates nationwide, including request letter templates.</p>
        
    
                                  
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="10.0">More than 120 people have told us that they have since requested or intend to request their claim files. Though a handful say they received information that helped them understand why their health insurer denied coverage, many more have been running into challenges. They’ve told us about insurers blowing past deadlines, wrongly requiring subpoenas and —&nbsp;in several cases — misinterpreting their request entirely.</p>
        
    
                    
            
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="12.0">We shared a summary of these examples with Tim Hauser, a deputy assistant secretary with the Department of Labor. His office oversees claim file laws that cover more than 131 million people. He said insurers who fail to provide records are breaking the law. “The claimant really needs to be able to see what the relevant evidence is so that they can respond to it,” he said.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="13.0">We brought our findings to five insurance companies. We presented them with details about the requests patients had made and how the company had responded, and we asked for an explanation of what happened in each case.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="14.0">All of the insurers acknowledged that the patients were entitled to the material they’d asked for. Four began sending the files after our inquiry. Two, spokespeople told us, are updating policies to handle future requests. Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield spokesperson Michael Bowman said the company needed to better train staff on the rules “to close any gaps to prevent this from occurring in the future.” Cigna spokesperson Justine Sessions admitted that patients do not need a subpoena to access their records, contrary to what the insurer had told a member. She said the company would update its “policies and communications to reflect that for future requests. We regret that we did not make these updates sooner and apologize for any frustration or confusion this has caused our customers.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="15.0">By crowdsourcing people’s experiences, we identified some patterns in health insurers’ behavior. Here are some of the most common issues people encountered — and what to watch out for if you <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/claimfile/">submit your own request</a>:</p>
        
    
                    
<h3>Insurers Asking for Unnecessary Subpoenas or Court Orders</h3>
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="17.0">Cigna and Anthem told members that they would need to obtain a court order or subpoena to access their claim file records.</p>
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="19.0">“This is completely unheard of,” said Wells Wilkinson, a senior attorney with the nonprofit legal group Public Health Advocates who regularly files these requests. “It also sounds completely illegal. The consumer has the right to any information used by the health plan in the context of the denial.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="20.0">On July 12, Lisa Kays, a Maryland resident, asked Cigna for phone call records related to its decision to deny coverage for her 4-year-old son’s speech therapy. “We couldn’t afford to just give up,” Kays said.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="21.0">In September, Cigna sent her a letter saying she would need to submit a subpoena to get any transcripts or recordings.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="21.1">After ProPublica inquired, the company sent Kays partial transcripts of the calls. It also reimbursed her for some of the previously denied coverage. She is still waiting for the recordings.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="22.0">We asked Anthem about a similar case. On July 19, a call center agent told Pamela Tsigdinos she would need a subpoena to receive her claim file records. Tsigdinos had submitted the request 50 days earlier.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="23.0">Bowman, the Anthem spokesperson, told us the response was an error and apologized. The company compiled the claim file and sent it to Tsigdinos.</p>

<h3>Insurers Confusing Claim File Requests With Appeals</h3>
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="23.1">At least five people told ProPublica that, after submitting a request for a claim file, their health insurer mistook the request for an appeal.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="24.0">We brought three cases to UnitedHealthcare. S.J. Farris requested her claim file from the company on May 10. Five days later, she received a response stating that her request for an appeal had been received. Farris sent a clarifying letter but was met with a call from an appeals agent based in Ireland. “I asked her to send the claim files,” Farris said. “She had no idea what I was talking about.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="25.0">After ProPublica sent the company questions, Farris received a call from UnitedHealth in October. They told her that the insurer was working on her claim file and that she should expect it soon. In a statement to ProPublica, UnitedHealth spokesperson Maria Gordon Shydlo said: “We take our responsibility to provide members access to their records seriously and have processes in place to comply with the law. We are sorry for any inconvenience.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="26.0">After Beth Tolley sent Anthem a claim file request on behalf of her granddaughter, she received a letter from the health insurer stating, “We’ve received a request from Beth Tolley for an appeal.” This left Tolley confused since, in its last communication, Anthem had said all avenues of appeal with its office had been exhausted.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="27.0">In early October, Anthem sent the Tolley family a check for the amount it had initially declined to cover. Bowman told ProPublica that the company would be sending the records soon. </p>

<h3>Insurers Blowing Past the 30-Day Deadline</h3>

        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="28.0">For most people who get insurance through their employers, <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/find-out-why-health-insurance-claim-denied">insurers are required to send claim files back</a> within 30 days, according to federal law.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="29.0">Twelve of the people whose requests ProPublica followed did not receive their records within that time frame even though they had these types of plans. Five of those had been waiting for responses from their insurers for more than 70 days before ProPublica contacted the companies with questions.</p>
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="31.0">Isabella Gonzalez submitted a claim file request via certified mail on Aug. 8. When she called Aetna to get an update, a representative told her they did not see it in the system and advised her to upload it onto the insurer’s online portal, which she did. She called back a few days later. A different customer service employee told her Aetna would respond in 45 days.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="32.0">Alex Kepnes, the executive director of communications for Aetna, said the company at first did not recognize what Gonzalez was asking for and therefore did not respond to it. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="32.1">Kepnes declined to respond to follow-up questions about why staff failed to correctly identify the request and whether the company would be taking action to ensure this does not happen again.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="32.2">Other companies that failed to follow the 30-day timeline include UnitedHealth, Anthem and Cigna. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="32.3">“It’s really important that these responses be timely,” said Hauser, the Department of Labor official. “If that’s not happening, it’s really contrary to the regulation.”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>In response to five class-action lawsuits, a Washington appeals court has decided that Honda and several other automakers did nothing wrong by storing text messages and call records from connected smartphones.</p>
<p>Honda, Toyota, Volkswagen, and General Motors were all facing charges in separate but related class-action suits that all claimed they violated Washington state privacy laws. The cases were all dismissed in court earlier this year, and the US Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit <a href="https://regmedia.co.uk/2023/11/09/honda-infotainment-privacy-appeal-decision.pdf" rel="nofollow">decided</a> [PDF] this week they weren't going to reopen the cases to further litigation.</p>
<p>The Circuit judges hearing the case lumped all of them together because "the factual background and legal issues are virtually identical," and dismissed the appeal not because the automakers hadn't done anything wrong, but rather because the claims didn't meet the Washington Privacy Act's (WPA) statutory injury requirements.</p>

    

<p>"To succeed at the pleading stage of a WPA claim, a plaintiff must allege an injury to 'his or her business, his or her person, or his or her reputation,'" the judges ruled. "Contrary to Plaintiffs' argument, a bare violation of the WPA is insufficient to satisfy the statutory injury requirement."</p>

        


        

<p>In other words, it's A-OK for your car to "automatically and without authorization, instantaneously intercept, record, download, store, and [be] capable of transmitting" text messages and call logs since the privacy violation is potential, but the injury not necessarily actual.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 9th Circuit judges' determination was based on the dismissal of a fifth class-action lawsuit in Washington that made the same arguments against Ford, which was <a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca9/22-35447/22-35447-2023-10-27.html" rel="nofollow">dismissed</a> in late October on identical grounds. One of the same 9th Circuit judges, Michael Daly Hawkins, was on the appeals panel that made both decisions.&nbsp;</p>

        

<p>We asked Honda and lawyers for both sides of the case to comment but haven't heard back.</p>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2017/12/06/car_rental_firms_in_car_data_slurps/">Car rental firms told: Tell your customers about in-car data slurps</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Per the first amended <a href="https://regmedia.co.uk/2023/11/09/honda-infotainment-class-action-suit.pdf" rel="nofollow">complaint</a> [PDF] filed in the Honda case, Honda infotainment systems in vehicles manufactured from 2014 onward "store each intercepted, recorded, and downloaded copy of text messages in non-temporary computer memory in such a manner that the vehicle owner cannot access it or delete it," plaintiffs argued. "Even if the text message is deleted from the smartphone, the Honda vehicle retains a copy in on-board memory, even after the smartphone is disconnected."&nbsp;</p>
<p>The same goes for call logs, the class-action complaint argued.</p>
<p>Plaintiffs accusing Honda of WPA violations pointed to Maryland-based Berla Corporation, which manufactures equipment "capable of extracting stored text messages from infotainment systems" as a reason for owners to consider the data harvesting a privacy concern. According to the suit, Berla software isn't generally available to the public, and is designed for law enforcement use.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Copies of text messages and call logs stored on Honda vehicles can be, and are, retrieved by unauthorized users of Berla's equipment without any password, fingerprint, face image, or other security measures, thus bypassing any security measures Plaintiffs and class members employ to secure data on their phones," the complaint alleged.</p>

        

<p>The Honda case and those involving Toyota, VW, and GM were all dismissed with prejudice, so the only way for the cases to go is up to the Supreme Court on further appeal. It's not immediately clear if further appeals are planned. ®</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-body-6565762679814978317" itemprop="description articleBody">
<p>The groundbreaking Intel 386 processor (1985) was the first 32-bit processor in the x86 line.
It has numerous internal registers: general-purpose registers, index registers, segment selectors, and
more specialized registers.
In this blog post, I look at the silicon die of the 386 and explain how some of these registers are
implemented at the transistor level.
The registers that I examined are implemented as static RAM, with each bit stored in a common 8-transistor circuit, known as "8T".
Studying this circuit shows the interesting layout techniques that Intel used to squeeze two storage cells together to minimize the space they require.</p>
<p>The diagram below shows the internal structure of the 386. I have marked the relevant registers with three red
boxes. Two sets of registers are in the segment descriptor cache, presumably holding cache entries, and one set is at the bottom of
the data path. Some of the registers at the bottom are 32 bits wide, while others are half as wide and
hold 16 bits. (More registers with different circuits, but I
won't discuss them in this post.)</p>

<h2>The 6T and 8T static RAM cells</h2>
<p>First, I'll explain how a 6T or 8T static cell holds a bit.
The basic idea behind a static RAM cell is to connect two inverters into a loop.
This circuit will be stable, with one inverter on and one inverter off, and each inverter supporting the other.
Depending on which inverter is on,
the circuit stores a 0 or a 1.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/386-reg/inverter-loop.png"><img alt="Two inverters in a loop can store a 0 or a 1." height="121" src="https://static.righto.com/images/386-reg/inverter-loop-w250.png" title="Two inverters in a loop can store a 0 or a 1." width="250"></a></p><p>Two inverters in a loop can store a 0 or a 1.</p>
<p>To write a new value into the circuit, two signals are fed in, forcing the inverters to the desired new values.
One inverter receives the new bit value, while the other inverter receives the complemented bit value.
This may seem like a brute-force way to update the bit, but it works.
The trick is that the inverters in the cell are small and weak, while the input signals are higher current,
able to overpower the inverters.<span id="fnref:flip"><a href="#fn:flip">1</a></span>
The write data lines (called bitlines) are connected to the inverters by pass transistors.<span id="fnref:pass"><a href="#fn:pass">2</a></span> When the pass transistors are on, the
signals on the write lines can pass through to the inverters. But when the pass transistors are off, the
inverters are isolated from the write lines.
Thus, the write control signal enables writing a new value to the inverters.
(This signal is called a wordline since it controls access to a word of storage.)
Since each inverter consists of two transistors<span id="fnref:inverter"><a href="#fn:inverter">7</a></span>, the circuit below consists of six transistors,
forming the 6T storage cell.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/386-reg/simple-cell.png"><img alt="Adding pass transistor so the cell can be written." height="125" src="https://static.righto.com/images/386-reg/simple-cell-w350.png" title="Adding pass transistor so the cell can be written." width="350"></a></p><p>Adding pass transistor so the cell can be written.</p>
<p>The 6T cell uses the same bitlines for reading and writing.
Adding two transistors creates the 8T circuit, which has the advantage that you can read one register
and write to another register at the same time. (I.e. the register file is two-ported.)
In the 8T cell below, two additional transistors (G and H) are used for reading.
Transistor G buffers the cell's value; it turns on if the inverter output is high, pulling the read output bitline low.<span id="fnref:precharge"><a href="#fn:precharge">3</a></span>
Transistor H is a pass transistor that blocks this signal until a read is performed on this register;
it is controlled by a read wordline.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/386-reg/cell-schematic.png"><img alt="Schematic of a storage cell. Each transistor is labeled with a letter." height="155" src="https://static.righto.com/images/386-reg/cell-schematic-w500.png" title="Schematic of a storage cell. Each transistor is labeled with a letter." width="500"></a></p><p>Schematic of a storage cell. Each transistor is labeled with a letter.</p>
<p>To form registers (or memory), a grid is constructed from these cells.
Each row corresponds to a register, while each column corresponds to a bit position.
The horizontal lines are the wordlines, selecting which word to access, while the
vertical lines are the bitlines, passing bits in or out of the registers.
For a write, the vertical bitlines provide the 32 bits (along with their complements).
For a read, the vertical bitlines receive the 32 bits from the register.
A wordline is activated to read or write the selected register.</p>

<h2>Silicon circuits in the 386</h2>
<p>Before showing the layout of the circuit on the die, I should give a bit of background on the technology used
to construct the 386.
The 386 was built with CMOS technology, with NMOS and PMOS transistors working together, an advance over the
earlier x86 chips that were built with NMOS transistors.
Intel called this CMOS technology CHMOS-III (complementary high-performance metal-oxide-silicon), with 1.5 µm features.
While Intel's earlier chips had a single metal layer, CHMOS-III provided two metal layers, making signal
routing much easier.</p>
<p>Because CMOS uses both NMOS and PMOS transistors, fabrication is more complicated.
In an MOS integrated circuit, a transistor is formed where a polysilicon wire crosses active silicon,
creating the transistor's gate.
A PMOS transistor is constructed directly on the silicon substrate (which is N-doped).
However, an NMOS transistor is the opposite, requiring a P-doped substrate.
This is created by forming a P well, a region
of P-doped silicon that holds NMOS transistors.
Each P well must be connected to ground; this is accomplished by connecting ground to specially-doped regions of the P well, called "well taps"`.</p>
<p>The diagram below shows a cross-section through two transistors, showing the layers of the chip.
There are four important layers: silicon (which has some regions doped to form active
silicon), polysilicon for wiring and transistors, and the two metal layers.
At the bottom is the silicon, with P or N doping; note the P-well for the NMOS transistor on the left.
Next is the polysilicon layer.
At the top are the two layers of metal, named M1 and M2. 
Conceptually, the chip is constructed from flat layers, but the layers have a three-dimensional
structure influenced by the layers below.
The layers are separated by silicon dioxide ("ox") or silicon oxynitride<span id="fnref:oxynitride"><a href="#fn:oxynitride">4</a></span>; the
oxynitride under M2 caused me considerable difficulty.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/386-reg/process-cross-section.jpg"><img alt="A cross-section of circuitry formed with the CHMOS-III process. From A double layer metal CHMOS III technology." height="244" src="https://static.righto.com/images/386-reg/process-cross-section-w600.jpg" title="A cross-section of circuitry formed with the CHMOS-III process. From A double layer metal CHMOS III technology." width="600"></a></p>
<p>The image below shows how circuitry appears on the die;<span id="fnref:layers"><a href="#fn:layers">5</a></span>
I removed the metal layers to show the silicon and polysilicon that form transistors.
(As will be described below, this image shows two static cells, holding two bits.)
The pinkish and dark regions are active silicon, doped to take part in the circuits, while the "background" silicon
can be ignored.
The green lines are polysilicon lines on top of the silicon.
Transistors are the most important feature here: a transistor gate is formed when polysilicon crosses active
silicon, with the source and drain on either side.
The upper part of the image has PMOS transistors, while the lower part of the image has the P well that holds
NMOS transistors. (The well itself is not visible.)
In total, the image shows four PMOS transistors and 12 NMOS transistors.
At the bottom, the well taps connect the P well to ground.
Although the metal has been removed, the contacts between the lower metal layer (M1) and the silicon or
polysilicon are visible as faint circles.</p>

<h2>Register layout in the 386</h2>
<p>Next, I'll explain the layout of these cells in the 386.
To increase the circuit density, two cells are put side-by-side, with a mirrored layout.
In this way, each row holds two interleaved registers.<span id="fnref:density"><a href="#fn:density">6</a></span>
The schematic below shows the arrangement of the paired cells, matching the die image above.
Transistors A and B form the first inverter,<span id="fnref2:inverter"><a href="#fn:inverter">7</a></span> while transistors C and D form the second
inverter.
Pass transistors E and F allow the bitlines to write the cell.
For reading, transistor G amplifies the signal while pass transistor H connects the selected bit to the
output.</p>

<p>The left and right sides are approximately mirror images, with separate read and write control lines for
each half.
Because the control lines for the left and right sides are in different positions, the two sides have
some layout differences, in particular, the bulging loop on the right.
Mirroring the cells increases the density since the bitlines can be shared by the cells.</p>
<!--
Inconveniently, the read outputs for the two cells are at opposite ends, so the output on the left is connected
to the read bitline on the right.
-->

<p>The diagram below shows the various components on the die,
labeled to match the schematic above.
I've drawn the lower M1 metal wiring in blue, but omitted the M2 wiring (horizontal control lines, power, and ground). "Read crossover" indicates the connection from the read output on the left to the bitline on the right.
Black circles indicate vias between M1 and M2, green circles indicate contacts between silicon and M1, and
reddish circles indicate contacts between polysilicon and M1.</p>

The M1 metal layer is drawn in blue; the horizontal M2 lines are not shown.</p>
<p>One more complication is that alternating registers (i.e. rows) are reflected vertically, as shown below.
This allows one horizontal power line to feed two rows, and similarly for a horizontal ground line.
This cuts the number of power/ground lines in half, making the layout more efficient.</p>

<p>Having two layers of metal makes the circuitry considerably more difficult to reverse engineer. The
photo below (left) shows one of the static RAM cells as it appears under the microscope.
Although the structure of the metal layers is visible in the photograph, there is a lot of ambiguity.
It is difficult to distinguish the two layers of metal. Moreover, the metal completely hides the
polysilicon layer, not to mention the underlying silicon.
The large black circles are vias between the two metal layers.
The smaller faint circles are contacts between a metal layer and the underlying silicon or polysilicon.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/386-reg/metal-layers.jpg"><img alt="One cell as it appears on the die, with a diagram of the upper (M2) and lower (M1) metal layers." height="452" src="https://static.righto.com/images/386-reg/metal-layers-w600.jpg" title="One cell as it appears on the die, with a diagram of the upper (M2) and lower (M1) metal layers." width="600"></a></p><p>One cell as it appears on the die, with a diagram of the upper (M2) and lower (M1) metal layers.</p>
<p>With some effort, I determined the metal layers, which I show on the right:
M2 (upper) and M1 (lower).
By comparing the left and right images, you can see how the structure of the metal layers is somewhat visible.
I use black circles to
indicate vias between the layers, green circles indicate contacts between M1 and silicon, and pink circles indicate
contacts between M1 and polysilicon.
Note that both metal layers are packed as tightly as possible.
The layout of this circuit was highly optimized to minimize the area.
It is interesting to note that decreasing the size of the transistors wouldn't help with this circuit, since
the size is limited by the metal density.
This illustrates that a fabrication process must balance the size of the metal features, polysilicon features,
and silicon features since over-optimizing one won't help the overall chip density.</p>
<p>The photo below shows the bottom of the register file.
The "notch" makes the registers at the very bottom half-width:
4 half-width rows corresponding to eight 16-bit registers.
Since there are six 16-bit segment registers in the 386, I suspect these are the segment registers and
two mystery registers.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/386-reg/split.jpg"><img alt="The bottom of the register file." height="186" src="https://static.righto.com/images/386-reg/split-w500.jpg" title="The bottom of the register file." width="500"></a></p><p>The bottom of the register file.</p>
<p>I haven't been able to determine which registers in the 386 correspond to the other registers on the die.
In the segment descriptor circuitry, there are two rows of register cells with ten more rows below,
corresponding to 24 32-bit registers. These are presumably segment descriptors.
At the bottom of the datapath, there are 10 32-bit registers with the T8 circuit.
The 386's programmer-visible registers consist of eight general-purpose 32-bit registers (EAX, etc.).
The 386 has various control registers, test registers, and segmentation registers<span id="fnref:registers"><a href="#fn:registers">8</a></span> that are
not well known.
The 8086 has a few registers for internal use that aren't visible to the programmer, so the 386 presumably
has even more invisible registers.
At this point, I can't narrow down the functionality.</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>It's interesting to examine how registers are implemented in a real processor. 
There are plenty of descriptions of the 8T static cell circuit, but it turns out that the physical implementation
is more complicated than the theoretical description.
Intel put a lot of effort into optimizing this circuit, resulting in a dense block of circuitry.
By mirroring cells horizontally and vertically, the density could be increased further.</p>
<p>Reverse engineering one small circuit of the 386 turned out to be pretty tricky, so I don't plan to do
a complete reverse engineering.
The main difficulty is the two layers of metal are hard to untangle.
Moreover, I lost most of the polysilicon when removing the metal.
Finally, it is hard to draw diagrams with four layers without the diagram turning into a mess,
but hopefully the diagrams made sense.</p>
<p>I plan to write more about the 386, so

I learned from older colleagues that O1 was actually more frequent in their time (probably in the 90s). This is hearsay, of course, but I heard it often enough that seems somewhat accurate. What changed and could the H1B vs O1 balance change in the future?

Can companies not absolutely file for PERM during layoffs or is there like a georgraphical restriction/meaning certain number of miles that they should look at to determine if layoffs have happened? Is there a fixed number of miles/radius?

No.  An H-1B can only be extended beyond the 6-year max-out period by recapturing time spent outside or by being in the green card (and being far enough along in this process). 2. For layoffs to be relevant - that is, for them to impact an employer's ability to file PERM applications - they must be in the same or similar occupation as the sponsored PERM occupation and be in the same geographic area.</span></p></div></td></tr>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Our 10 person startup gets acquired by Google, we rebuild our product the Google way, and begin to understand that amazing things are possible at Google, if you play the Google game. A follow up to <a href="https://shreyans.org/venmo" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">What I learned at Venmo</a> and <a href="https://shreyans.org/socratic" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">What I learned at Socratic</a></em></p>
<p><img src="https://shreyans.org/images/posts/google/nooglers.jpg" alt="Nooglers"></p>
<hr>
<p>As we started to raise <a href="https://shreyans.org/socratic">Socratic’s</a> Series B in 2017, we quickly learned that our focus on getting usage at the expense of revenue was going to bite us. Our growth got us in the door, but every VC asked for a monetization plan, and in the process of figuring that out we concluded that an education app focused on credit-card-less high school students wasn’t going to become a big business.</p>
<p>Around the same time, we were introduced to Evan Spiegel, the CEO of Snapchat. Evan suggested a partnership to integrate our camera-based homework helper into their app. But one of our advisors figured that if he introduced you to their Head of Corporate Development, he may be suggesting an eventual acquisition, and if so, we should get a competitive process going. So we did, and reached out to Microsoft, Chegg, Byju’s, and Google.</p>
<p>My co-founder, Chris, had previously worked at Google and reconnected with his past manager to get an intro to Lens - Google’s camera-first app. What we didn’t know was that she had recently started an education effort of her own, along with the co-founders of Khan Academy and Android. We met and learned that we had hugely overlapping visions for a learning-focused, AI-powered tutor. Maybe it helped that we had just won Google’s <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/topic?id=campaign_editorial_apps_bestof2017" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Android App of the Year</a>, but soon after that meeting, we kicked off a process that led to Google acquiring Socratic in March of 2018.</p>
<p>We merged with an existing team of the same size, composed of multiple long tenured Googlers. Chris and I became the product and engineering leads, tasked with building an AI-powered tutor and bringing those capabilities to Google’s largest products.</p>
<p>Over the next three years, we rebuilt Socratic and relaunched it as “Socratic by Google”<sup><a href="#note-1">1</a></sup>, shipped Socratic features in Search and Lens, released a math solver and prototyped a step-by-step math tutor, and built capabilities that are being used across Google.</p>
<p>Some things I learned along the way:</p>
<p><strong>Working at Google is like having a second passport.</strong> Go to any major city in the world and your badge<sup><a href="#note-2">2</a></sup> unlocks a beautiful office with great food, desks, and a high speed link to every person in Google’s 200,000+ person network. And like visiting America as a foreigner, everything you see inside feels oddly familiar because of its massive exported influence, yet is just slightly different.</p>
<p>Shockingly, you get immediate access to all of it. Access to their gigantic monorepo<sup><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2854146" target="_blank">🔗</a></sup> with billions of lines of code covering almost all their products. Live statuses of their globe-covering data centers. Strategy documents spanning two decades of history. And direct access to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Dean" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">legends</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Google does things the Google way.</strong> Just about every piece of software and infrastructure used at Google was built at Google, a natural result of facing the hardest engineering problems earlier than most companies. At Google's scale, the external world ceases to exist and is only rarely and carefully allowed to enter their walls.</p>
<p>This meant that there was no chance of keeping our existing codebase. We would need to start from scratch, rediscovering our product insights with the new team, then rebuilding our app on Google’s stack. Problems we had already solved, like our ML system to classify the topics in a homework problem, had to be re-solved using Search techniques and to Search standards, which needless to say were higher than ours. </p>
<p>One place we were able to break Google's mold was with ‘Ceebo’, our app mascot. Look at Google’s collection of app icons and you’ll see four colors and simple shapes. Works for them, but boring to us. They pushed (“we don’t anthropomorphize”), we pushed back (“you do with Android!”), until we finally got our way because we were too small to matter. Ceebo lives on as our app icon, and has blossomed within Google, where dozens of variants have been illustrated, and Ceebo pops up in surprising docs and sites all around Google. </p>
<p><img src="https://shreyans.org/images/posts/google/google_app_logos.png" alt="The usual Google app logos">
<em>The usual Google app logos vs. Ceebo</em></p>
<p><img src="https://shreyans.org/images/posts/google/socratic_app_logo.png" alt="Socratic's cbo"></p><p><strong>Simple things done repeatedly feel magical.</strong> Re-building our query classification system alongside Search veterans was an illuminating peek into how Search itself was built. On the one hand there’s the incredible depth of information retrieval tools, and the mind-boggling ability to calculate and add a new signal to <em>every page on the Internet</em> (e.g. <code>contains_math</code>, or <code>subject:chemistry</code>).</p>
<p>On the other hand there was the discovery that most Search improvements are manually reviewed by engineers through ‘side-by-side’ comparisons between old and new results...on spreadsheets! </p>
<p>One may expect Google engineering to largely consist of implementing PhD level algorithms, and while that's sometimes true, much of a search or AI engineer's job involves looking at examples, spotting patterns, hand labelling data, and other non-scalable, in-the-weeds analysis. This seems to be generally true among the best AI teams:</p>
<p><em>"One pattern I noticed is that great AI researchers are willing to manually inspect lots of data. And more than that, they build infrastructure that allows them to manually inspect data quickly. Though not glamorous, manually examining data gives valuable intuitions about the problem."</em><sup><a href="https://twitter.com/_jasonwei/status/1708921475829481683" target="_blank">🔗</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Most problems aren’t worth Google’s time, but surprising ones are.</strong> Most 10-50 million user problems aren’t worth Google's time, and don’t fit their strategy. But they’ll take on significant effort on problems that do fit their nature, strategy, and someone’s promotion goals. </p>
<p>One such example: computer vision is a big part of Socratic’s interface, specifically being able to read text and math in images. As a startup we used a 3rd party tool, but between exposing sensitive data, expectations of scale, and a complex vendor review process - using it within Google proved too difficult. Sometimes it’s easier to just buy the company to bring the tech in-house. Other times, as in our case, there’s an AI research team that’s interested in the problem, hires a top PhD talent to work on it, and delivers a world-class math recognition API within 6 months.</p>
<p>Of course, if you’ve read Steve Yegge’s <a href="https://gist.github.com/chitchcock/1281611" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">classic blog post</a> comparing Google and Amazon's platforms, you’ll know that this world class service was not externalized.</p>
<p><strong>Google is an ever shifting web of goals and efforts.</strong> Amazing things are possible at Google, if the right people care about them. A VP that gets it, a research team with a related charter, or compatibility with an org’s goals. Navigating this mess of interests is half of a PM’s job. And then you need the blessing of approvers like privacy, trust and safety, and infra capacity. It takes dozens of conversations to know if an idea is viable, and hundreds more to make it a reality.</p>
<p>And that’s the happy path. Amazing things are possible at Google, if the right people <em>keep</em> caring about them. Team goals can change in any given quarter, and entire teams can disappear in the face of a 'reorg', a phenomenon so common that Googlers can look past the tragedy and see the comedy in it.</p>
<p>Suppose you dodge all those bullets, you might still wake up to find that while you were working on your project, two distant teams were also working on the same idea, and the time has come to fight it out because only one can proceed. The internal users of the losing projects will find that the API they depended on is now ‘deprecated’, but the replacement, well it’s not quite ready yet.</p>
<p><strong>Googlers wanted to ship great work, but often couldn’t.</strong> While there were undoubtedly people who came in for the food, worked 3 hours a day, and enjoyed their early retirements, all the people I met were earnest, hard-working, and wanted to do great work.</p>
<p>What beat them down were the gauntlet of reviews, the frequent re-orgs, the institutional scar tissue from past failures, and the complexity of doing even simple things on the world stage. Startups can afford to ignore many concerns, Googlers rarely can.</p>
<p>What also got in the way were the people themselves - all the smart people who could argue against anything but not <em>for</em> something, all the leaders who lacked the courage to speak the uncomfortable truth, and all the people that were hired without a clear project to work on, but must still be retained through promotion-worthy made-up work.</p>
<p><img src="https://shreyans.org/images/posts/google/nooglers-no-more.jpg" alt="Nooglers no more"></p>
<p><strong>Top heavy orgs are hard to steer.</strong> Another blocker to progress that I saw up close was the imbalance of a top heavy team. A team with multiple successful co-founders and 10-20 year Google veterans might sound like a recipe for great things, but it’s also a recipe for gridlock.</p>
<p>This structure might work if there are multiple areas to explore, clear goals, and strong autonomy to pursue those paths. But if you want to work on one unified product, it needs a clear leader, with a clear direction, and more doers than thinkers. And counter-intuitively, adding more people to an early-stage project doesn't make it go faster.</p>
<p><strong>Technical debt is real. So is process debt.</strong> Engineers are used to talking about <em>technical debt</em>: a corner that you cut today to save time and ship a feature; a loan from your future self that is either paid back in time or it slowly gets more expensive to deal with. Good teams regularly pay down debt by cleaning things up on quieter days.</p>
<p>Just as real is process debt. A review added because of a launch gone wrong. A new legal check to guard against possible litigation. A section added to a document template. Layers accumulate over the years until you end up unable to release a new feature for months after it's ready because it's stuck between reviews, with an unclear path out.</p>
<p>In some rare cases, process is rolled back: Google recently changed their onerous perf(ormance review) process, from twice a year to once, from a long to a short questionnaire, and hopefully from 30+% of a manager's year to less than 10%.</p>
<p>And sometimes an external threat either forces this change, or percipitates a company's decline. Google invented the technologies behind ChatGPT, but wasn't the one to release that product. Now it must resolve the growing tension between the builders that want to reclaim Google's AI lead, and the reviewers that want to guard against all possible troubles<sup><a href="https://www.rtinsights.com/google-svp-cautions-against-launching-ai-products-too-quickly/" target="_blank">🔗</a></sup>.</p>
<p><strong>Amazing things are possible at Google, if you play the right game.</strong> Google used to have a set of internal values they called "The Three Respects": respect the user, respect each other, and respect the opportunity. The first two are somewhat easy to understand, but the third one confused most people. My interpretation is as follows: you're at Google, an insanely profitable, genius-filled enterprise. You're well-paid, well-fed, and live in the eternal spring paradise of Silicon Valley. <em>What's the best thing you can do with this insane luck?</em></p>
<p>And my answer to that question echoes what Richard Hamming said in his great talk, <em>You and Your Research</em><sup><a href="https://d37ugbyn3rpeym.cloudfront.net/stripe-press/TAODSAE_zine_press.pdf" target="_blank">🔗</a></sup>: you must find the most important problem in your field, and play whatever games necessary to solve it.</p>
<p>Practically, what this means is to first do the work that is given to you. But once that's under control, to reach out into the vast Google network, to learn what's being planned and invented, to coalesce a clear image of the future, to give it shape through docs and demos, to find the leaders whose goals align with this image, and to sell the idea as persistently as you can.</p>
<p>To some extent I did this. One of my favorite examples was a demo for a step-by-step math tutor, built on top of our new math solver, made by three of us on the side over a few months. The demo gave our vision for intelligent tutoring a tangible form - it had a link, it could be used, it could be shared. It grounded conversations, gave people something specific to react to, and took on a life outside our team, being passed around, independently discussed, and leading back to us.</p>
<p>I also saw this go wrong. One of our leaders clearly saw the world we were heading towards, had designers make great demos, and would share them whenever he could. But he was trapped in the wrong part of the company, and his boss's goals pointed elsewhere. He eventually switched to a more compatible team, and his dream now has a chance of becoming a reality.</p>
<p><strong>Many acquisitions fail. Socratic's story is mixed.</strong> On one hand, we managed to merge two vastly different cultures, our product lives on and has grown to serve ~5 <em>billion</em> queries a year, and careers across the Socratic team have bloomed.</p>
<p>On the other, both Chris and I left Google to found startups<sup><a href="#note-3">3</a></sup>, and neither the Socratic team nor Google as a whole have yet produced an AI powered tutor worthy of Google's capabilities. But a few Socratic Googlers might yet make it happen, unless they've been re-org'd.</p>

				<p id="speakable-summary"><span>As dawn breaks</span> over Silicon Valley, the world is getting its first look at Pathfinder 1, a prototype electric airship that its maker LTA Research hopes will kickstart a new era in climate-friendly air travel, and accelerate the humanitarian work of its funder, Google co-founder Sergey Brin.</p>
<p>The airship — its snow-white steampunk profile visible from the busy 101 highway — has taken drone technology such as fly-by-wire controls, electric motors and lidar sensing, and supersized them to something longer than three Boeing 737s, potentially able to carry tons of cargo over many hundreds of miles.</p>
<p>“It’s been 10 years of blood, sweat and tears,” LTA CEO Alan Weston told TechCrunch on the eve of the unveiling. “Now we must show that this can reliably fly in real-world conditions. And we’re going to do that.”</p>
<p>A series of increasingly ambitious flight tests lie ahead, before Pathfinder 1 is moved to Akron, Ohio, where <a href="https://www.ltaresearch.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LTA Research</a> is planning an even larger airship, the Pathfinder 3. The company eventually hopes to produce a family of airships to provide disaster relief where roads and airports are damaged, as well as zero-carbon passenger transportation.</p>
<p>For the next year however, the gigantic airship looks set to become a Silicon Valley landmark as its novel materials and systems are methodically put through their paces within shouting distance of companies like Google, Meta and Amazon. “I’m excited about the potential of not building just one airship, but laying the foundation for many airships to be built,” said Weston. “The innovations and the technologies that we’re about to demonstrate have the potential to lay the foundation for a new industry.”</p>
<h2>The biggest aircraft in almost a century</h2>

<p>At 124.5 meters long, Pathfinder 1 dwarfs the current Goodyear airships and even the massive Stratolaunch plane designed to launch orbital rockets. It’s the largest aircraft to take to the skies since the gargantuan Hindenburg airship of the 1930s. Although similar in appearance to that ill-fated airship, and using a passenger gondola supplied by Zeppelin, the Pathfinder 1 was mostly built from the ground up using new materials and technologies.</p>
<p>LTA’s airship uses stable helium rather than flammable hydrogen as a lifting gas, held in 13 giant rip-stop nylon cells and monitored by lidar laser systems. A rigid framework of 10,000 carbon-fiber reinforced tubes and 3,000 titanium hubs form a protective skeleton around the gas cells, surrounded by a lightweight synthetic Tedlar skin.</p>
<p>Twelve electric motors powered by diesel generators and batteries enable vertical take-off and landing. They can propel the Pathfinder 1 at up to 65 knots (75 mph), although its initial flights will be at much lower speeds.</p>
<p>This morning, the airship floated silently from its WW2-era hangar at NASA’s Moffett Field at walking pace, steered by ropes held by dozens of the company’s engineers, technicians and ground crew.</p>
<p>The whole operation occurred under the cover of darkness, not because LTA has something to hide but because the airship’s flight test program begins with the first rays of the morning sun. The first lesson its engineers hope to learn is how Pathfinder 1’s approximately one million cubic feet of helium and weather resistant polymer skin will respond to the warming effect of Californian sunshine.</p>
<p>“We have sophisticated methodology that allows us to replicate real-world conditions using static test stands,” said Jillian Hilenski, senior mechanical engineer at LTA. “However, dynamic on-ship flight tests provide the best data on the health and efficiency of the airship.”</p>
<h2>Test, test, test again</h2>

<p>At the start of September, the FAA issued a <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/lta-airship-faa-clearance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">special airworthiness certificate</a> for the Pathfinder 1 allowing test flights in and around Moffett Field and the nearby Palo Alto airport, and over the southern part of the San Francisco Bay.</p>
<p>Those tests will initially happen just a few feet off the ground, with the airship tethered to a mobile tripod mast. These will be followed by simple maneuvers around Moffett Field, before a series of flights out and over the Bay.</p>
<p>“The advantages of going over the water are multiple,” said Weston. “First of all, when you come off Moffett Field, the air is smoother over the Bay than it is anywhere else. That’s very important. And there’s not much in the way of traffic on the surface, so that’s a big plus as well.”</p>
<p>Safety is top of Weston’s mind as he works to reintroduce rigid airships to the skies of North America — and ultimately the world. The first 50 flights of Pathfinder 1 covered by the FAA certificate will allow flights no higher than 1,500 feet, and will use two pilots rather than the single pilot the airship was designed to need.</p>
<p>“I can count the number of companies in the lighter-than-air space on my hands, and we all have a lot to lose if anybody has a serious problem,” he said. Weston says LTA is working closely with the FAA to ensure that anything the company builds has a safe and sensible path to full certification. “The last maiden flight of an airship like this was the Graf Zeppelin II in 1938,” he noted during the interview. “The FAA wasn’t even around then.”</p>
<h2>Back to the future</h2>
<p>In a world of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/evtol/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eVTOL air-taxis</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/electric-aircraft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">electric aviation startups</a> and hydrogen planes, Weston acknowledges that airships are only ever likely to be a partial solution. “I can’t see airships replacing aircraft,” he said. “But I do see a niche for airships to be part of the transportation architecture that reduces the carbon footprint of air travel.”</p>
<p>Another important niche could be responding to natural disasters like earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and hurricanes. Sergey Brin also funds a nonprofit called <a href="https://www.gsd.ngo/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Global Support and Development</a> that aims to deliver humanitarian aid within the first 24 to 96 hours of a disaster.</p>
<p>Brin founded GSD in 2015 after using his own superyacht to deploy medics to the scene of a cyclone in the South Pacific. The nonprofit has since partnered with the nonprofit YachtAid Global, and now also has its own purpose-built vessel, the <a href="https://www.gsd.ngo/en/what-we-do/humanitarian-vessel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MV Dawn</a>, that can swiftly transport dozens of doctors and aid workers, alongside life-saving supplies.</p>
<p>While Pathfinder 1 can carry about four tons of cargo in addition to its crew, water ballast and fuel, future humanitarian airships will need much larger capacities. They will also likely use zero-carbon technologies like hydrogen fuel cells for power, said Hilenski. That will involve a long, slow slog to validate the new technologies and to demonstrate, to the FAA and paying customers, that a new generation of super-large airships can match the generally excellent safety and reliability record of today’s commercial jets.</p>
<p>“What excites me about what we’ve done so far is that we’ve shown to ourselves, and we hope to show to the rest of the world, that we can scale in size and productivity,” said Weston. “And I believe in our potential to scale up again in the future.”</p>
<p>The FAA’s experimental certificate for the Pathfinder 1 expires in September 2024.</p>

                    <p>TL;DR</p>
<p>Today, we’re announcing a free early preview of CLion, which uses the ReSharper C++/Rider C++ language engine instead of the CLion "legacy" engine. The Preview build is available via our dedicated Toolbox App feed. At some point in 2024, depending on the results of the feedback collected, CLion Nova will be merged into CLion. Until then, the Preview build will be free to use and can be installed in parallel with your usual CLion (Classic) installation.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox-app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" alt="CLion Nova" width="640" src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Featured_Blog_1280x720_CLionNova.png"></a></p>
<h2 id="prehistory">Prehistory</h2>
<p>The first C++ engine by JetBrains was designed for AppCode, our IDE for iOS and macOS developers. It was part of the IntelliJ Platform, initially written in Java and later also in Kotlin. The approach and the architecture of the engine serve many languages in IntelliJ-based IDEs well; however, this design turned out not to be the best fit for the C++ language specifically.</p>
<p>To more quickly align with the evolution of C++ and to separate the engine and IDE processes, a clangd-based engine was later added to CLion. Built on our custom branch of clangd, this engine detects any warnings and errors, shows them in the editor, and suggests quick-fixes, as well as performing highlighting, completion, and certain navigation actions. It’s also used for things like <a href="https://blog.jetbrains.com/clion/2023/11/striving-for-better-cpp-code-part-i-data-flow-analysis-basics/">data flow analysis</a> and MISRA checks. Meanwhile, CLion’s “legacy” engine is responsible for other code insight features like refactorings. You can see a detailed “list of responsibilities” in our <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/2023.3/c-support.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CLion documentation</a>.</p>
<p>Clangd has many advantages, but it isn’t very helpful when it comes to project-wide refactorings and actions. We prototyped a clangd-based indexer and even implemented an experimental <em>Find Usages</em> on top of it, which you can <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/2023.3/find-highlight-usages.html#usages-clangdindexer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">enable and evaluate in </a><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/2023.3/find-highlight-usages.html#usages-clangdindexer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CLion</a>.</p>
<p>Another alternative developed by JetBrains for C++ is the language engine used in ReSharper C++ and Rider (for game development in C++). There is also a communication protocol in place that makes it possible for an IntelliJ-based IDE like Rider to communicate with the stand-alone backend process serving as a language engine. We have now adapted this protocol and the original engine to CLion as well!</p>
<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
<p>In this new and experimental solution, we’re focused on the responsiveness, accuracy, and performance of the IDE. There are two main goals we have in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Addressing the long-standing <strong>performance</strong> and <strong>quality</strong> issues of CLion caused by the usage of the “legacy” engine.</li>
<li>Unifying the user experience across all of our C++ tools, i.e. CLion, Rider, and ReSharper C++.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" alt="CLion Nova About" width="531" src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/about.png"></p>
<p>We named our new experimental preview <strong>CLion Nova,</strong> and the current version of CLion is now <strong>CLion Classic</strong>. In the future, we plan for CLion Nova to be merged into CLion Classic. No new product is envisaged.</p>
<h2 id="benefits_and_enhancements">Benefits and enhancements</h2>
<p>CLion Nova still uses two C++ language engines: a clangd-based one and the one used by ReSharper C++/Rider. Most of the features of CLion Classic should work exactly the same in CLion Nova.</p>
<p>The most notable benefits in terms of performance in CLion Nova are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Faster highlighting speeds, especially in the case of incremental code updates</li>
<li>A more responsive UI</li>
<li>Faster <em>Find Usages</em></li>
<li>Significantly fewer freezes and hangs in refactorings</li>
<li>Faster test indexing</li>
</ul>
<p>This unification also brings some new functions to CLion Nova that aren’t included in CLion Classic’s feature set:</p>
<ul>
<li>New refactorings like <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/resharper/Refactorings_for_CPP.html#intro_field" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introduce field</a>, <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/resharper/Refactorings_for_CPP.html#namespace_alias" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introduce namespace alias</a>, <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/resharper/Refactorings_for_CPP.html#using_enum" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introduce using enumeration</a>, and <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/resharper/Refactorings_for_CPP.html#convert_to_scoped" target="_blank" rel="noopener">convert to scoped enumeration</a>.</li>
<li>New inspections, quick-fixes, and intentions like redundant qualifier, the replace <code>auto</code> with explicit type declaration, and <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/resharper/Code_Style_Assistance_in_CPP.html#sort_includes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sorting of </a><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/resharper/Code_Style_Assistance_in_CPP.html#sort_includes" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>#include</code></a><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/resharper/Code_Style_Assistance_in_CPP.html#sort_includes" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> directives</a>.</li>
<li>New code hints like <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/resharper/Settings_Inlay_Hints_CPP_Other.html#preprocessor-directive" target="_blank" rel="noopener">preprocessor directive hints</a>﻿ and a <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/resharper/Inline_Parameter_Name_Hints.html#push-to-hint-mode" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Push-to-Hint mode</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" alt="Sorting includes" width="600" src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/sort_includes.png"></p>
<h2 id="notable_differences">Notable differences</h2>
<p>Unlike CLion Classic, CLion Nova doesn’t use <strong>clangd</strong> for core IDE features like code completion or highlighting. However, the JetBrains’ clangd fork is still running alongside the new engine for various tasks (ClangFormat, Clang-Tidy, MISRA checks, data flow analysis, etc.).</p>
<p>There are a few things that will look and feel new to CLion Classic users when they start using CLion Nova:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some of the ways the IDE reacts when the user is typing are different.</li>
<li>Some UI elements and settings related to code insight features might look unusual or be found in unfamiliar locations.</li>
<li>Some code-related settings might have different default values in CLion Nova. On the first launch, CLion Nova will migrate some of your per-project and per-application settings from CLion Classic, but not all of them.</li>
<li>Switching between different language configurations (i.e. Debug/Release) might require more time for the code insight engine to catch up. There is also no option to switch resolve context per file.</li>
<li>ReSharper C++ is Windows-only, while Rider is cross-platform. Still, the ReSharper C++/Rider engine might not support non-Windows environments as seamlessly as a Windows one. It’s worth reporting such cases to us if you come across them.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" alt="Type conversion hints settings" width="912" src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/type_conversion_hints.png"></p>
<p>There’s also a list of currently missing functionality:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Toolchains</strong>: Several options exist to set up <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/2023.3/remote-development.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">remote work</a> in CLion. Remote work with local sources is supported in CLion Nova, while remote work with a thin client (Gateway) is not yet available.</li>
<li><strong>Languages</strong>: Objective-C language, CUDA (<a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/RSCPP-613" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RSCPP-613</a>, <a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/CPP-26144" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CPP-26144</a>), and some vendor-specific compiler extensions aren’t yet supported.</li>
<li>Some intentions and quick-fixes like <em>Simplify statement</em> are not supported at present (<a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/CPP-35879" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CPP-35879</a>).</li>
<li>Some less popular refactorings are also missing. We plan to reintroduce the <em>Move</em> (<a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/CPP-35867" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CPP-35867</a>) and <em>Inline Parameter</em> refactorings (<a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/CPP-35868" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CPP-35868</a>) at a later date.</li>
<li>JetBrains’ AI Assistant is not yet available for CLion Nova.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how_to_install_clion_nova">How to install CLion Nova</h2>
<p>CLion Nova is a free early preview build available only via the <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox-app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Toolbox App</a>:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" alt="Toolbox app" width="427" src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/toolbox_app.png"></p>
<p>CLion Nova is an Early Access Preview build, which means a login is required, but you can use it for free until CLion Nova merges into CLion. We’ll be publishing regular updates to CLion Nova, which will also be available via the Toolbox App.</p>
<p>Compared to CLion Classic, CLion Nova brings a more responsive UI, better overall IDE performance, and increased feature quality, especially with C++ code refactorings. Try it now and let us know what you think!</p>

<p>CLion Nova marks a big change and requires detailed testing in various environments. So we’re asking you, our users, for help! Given that you have a variety of environments and use cases, we want you to test out CLion Nova and share your experiences with us.</p>
<p>We are specifically interested in your thoughts on:</p>
<ul>
<li>What works better on your project in CLion Nova compared to CLion Classic?</li>
<li>What interrupts your workflow and prevents you from using the IDE in CLion Nova? Are these interruptions CLion Nova-specific, or are they also present in CLion Classic?</li>
</ul>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-element="story-body" data-dateline="" data-subscriber-content="">  <p><span>SPATA, Greece&nbsp;—&nbsp;</span></p><p>In an olive grove on the outskirts of Athens, grower Konstantinos Markou pushes aside the shoots of new growth to reveal the stump of a tree — a roughly 150-year-old specimen, he said, that was among 15 cut down on his neighbor’s land by thieves eager to turn it into money.</p><p>Surging olive oil prices, driven in part by <a href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2023-03-26/pray-for-rain-spanish-farmers-hold-unique-mass-amid-drought">two years of drought in Spain</a>, has meant opportunity for criminals across the Mediterranean. Warehouse break-ins, dilution of premium oil with inferior product and falsification of shipping data are on the rise in olive-growing heartlands of Greece, Spain and Italy. And perhaps worst of all: gangs using chainsaws to steal heavily laden branches and even entire trees from unguarded groves.</p><p>“The olive robbers can sometimes produce more oil than the owners themselves — seriously,” Markou said, before heading off to patrol his own grove at nightfall. </p><p>The crimes mean fewer olives for growers already contending with high production costs and climate changes that have brought warmer winters, major flooding and <a href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2023-08-24/greece-wildfires-largest-ever-european-union">more intense forest fires</a>. In Italy’s southern Puglia region, growers are pleading with police to form an agriculture division. Greek farmers want to bring back a rural police division that was phased out in 2010. In Spain, a company has developed tracking devices that look like olives to try to catch thieves.</p><p>The groves outside Athens are part of an agricultural tradition that <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1998-nov-26-fi-47925-story.html">stretches back to antiquity</a>, on plains that now surround the city’s international airport. Some trees are centuries old.</p><p>Most of the thefts are of branches. When an entire tree is cut down, the thieves typically chop it up and load the pieces into a pickup truck, taking the olives to an oil mill and selling the wood to lumberyards or firewood vendors.</p><p>The robbers “look for heavily loaded branches and they cut them,” said Neilos Papachristou, who runs an olive mill and nearby grove in a fourth-generation family business. “So, not only do they steal our olives, but they cause the tree serious harm. It takes four to five years for it to return to normal.”</p><p>The thefts are driving some growers to harvest early, which means accepting lower yields to avoid long-term damage to their trees. Christos Bekas was among the farmers at Papachristou’s mill who were dumping their crop into stainless steel loading bins, untying sacks and tipping over tall wicker baskets from the back of their pickup trucks.</p><p>Bekas, who owns 5,000 olive trees, suffered repeated raids by thieves before deciding to take an early harvest. That has meant needing 2½ times as much in the weight of the olives to produce a kilogram (2.2 pounds) of oil as last year, he said.</p><p>“And all this after we’ve been spending nights guarding our fields,” he said. ”The situation is appalling.”</p><p>After decades of growth, the global olive oil market has been disrupted by a nearly <a href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2022-09-04/drought-europe-climate-change">two-year drought in Spain</a>, which typically accounts for about 40% of world supply. It’s expected to shrink global production to about 2.76 million tons this crop year, down from 3.75 million a year earlier.</p><p>Benchmark prices in Spain, Greece and Italy for extra virgin olive oil reached $4.35 per pound in September, more than triple their level in 2019.</p><p>That’s translated to higher prices for consumers. In Greece, a quart of extra virgin olive oil jumped from around $8 or $9 last year to as much as $15 this year.</p><p>Spanish police said in October that they had retrieved 100 tons of stolen olives in recent weeks. In February, six people were arrested in southern Greece for the theft of 8.8 tons of olive oil in a series of warehouse break-ins over several weeks.</p><p>Farmers around Italy’s southwestern port city of Bari say thieves have become increasingly brazen, snatching tractors and expensive equipment along with olives.</p><p>The regional agricultural association issued a plea for police assistance following reports that 100 olive trees were destroyed or seriously damaged in a single incident last month. Gennaro Sicolo, the association’s leader, called the economic damage “enormous” and said that “farmers must be protected.”</p><p>“This is a felony,” Markou, the grower near Athens, said of the tree-cutting. “You kill your own history here.”</p> </div></div>]]></description>

I am sorry to say there is no such thing as the perfect laptop. There are too many variables at play, too many use cases to handle. All laptops have trade-offs.</p><p>There are, however, some that come close enough to perfect, and System76’s updated Lemur Pro is about as close to the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/best-linux-laptops/">perfect Linux laptop</a> as you’re likely to get. Part of that is the simple, clean design, but much of it comes from the customization options. System76 has put in a lot of work in the firmware and software that ships with the Lemur Pro.</p><p>Hardware</p><p>System76’s Lemur Pro line is the company’s thin and light laptop. It’s not a gaming rig, nor would it be my top pick for a dedicated video editing station. (That said, I edited a ton of video on it. It’s certainly capable, if not optimized for video.) However, if you need a solid Linux laptop that’s light enough to carry with you everywhere you go, offers a ton of expansion possibilities, and just works, then the Lemur Pro should be almost everything you’re looking for.</p><figure><p><span><p>System76 Lemur Pro Laptop.</p>
</span><span>Photograph: System76</span></p></figure><native-ad position="in-content" shoulddisplaylabel="true"></native-ad><p>The Lemur Pro is a 14-inch all-around laptop that’s thin and lightweight. At just 2.5 pounds and 0.54 inches thick, you can slide the Lemur Pro in a small bag and forget you’re even carrying it. System76 makes larger, more powerful laptops if you need one, but the Lemur Pro is the ultraportable one in the lineup.</p><p>The latest iteration of the Lemur Pro arrived earlier this year, with new 13th-generation Intel chips inside. The Lemur Pro starts at $1,150 for an Intel i5 machine with 8 GB of RAM and a 256-GB SSD. The model I tested had a 5-GHz Intel Core i7 chip (1355U), 16 GB of RAM, a 250-GB SSD OS drive, and a 1-TB SSD for storage. That brought the price to $1,474.</p><p>The price is reasonable for the hardware (if perhaps a tad high), but part of what you’re paying for is System76’s excellent support for Linux, which is hard to come by in cheaper options. The Lemur Pro base model is also user-upgradeable, so if you already have <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/best-portable-external-storage-drives/#six">a few PCIe SSDs</a> and some RAM lying about, you could upgrade the Lemur yourself.</p><figure><p><span><p>System76 Lemur Pro Laptop.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            

<p><span>2023-11-06</span> Earlier this year in July, Servo received a NLnet grant to enhance several aspects of Servo.</p>

<div>
  <p>We are excited to announce that earlier this year in July, Servo received a <strong><a href="https://nlnet.nl/project/Servo/">NLnet grant</a></strong> to enhance several aspects of Servo. Under this grant, our primary focus is to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Complete float support in Servo</strong></li>
<li><strong>Support more languages in inline layout</strong></li>
<li><strong>Add initial &lt;table&gt; support</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="floats" tabindex="-1">Floats <a href="#floats">
        <span><i></i></span>
      </a></h2>
<p>Supporting floats in Servo is an ongoing effort since mid-2023. We’ve made significant progress on floats, but there are still some issues that need to be addressed before Servo can boast a fully-compliant implementation of CSS floats.</p>
<p>Our objective is to achieve an average pass rate of over 80% for <code>/css/CSS2/floats/</code> and <code>/css/CSS2/floats-clear/</code>. You can track the results on our <strong><a href="https://wpt.servo.org/">WPT dashboard</a></strong></p>
<p>Last week, we surpassed this for the floats tests, with an 82.2% WPT pass rate:</p>
<p><img src="https://servo.org/img/blog/floats-2023-11-06.png" alt="Image showing web platform test result for floats, that is 82.2%"></p><p>We’re also nearing the milestone for floats-clear, currently at a 73.3% pass rate:</p>
<p><img src="https://servo.org/img/blog/floats-clear-2023-11-06.png" alt="Image showing web platform test result for floats-clear, that is 73.3%"></p><h2 id="more-languages-in-inline-layout" tabindex="-1">More languages in inline layout <a href="#more-languages-in-inline-layout">
        <span><i></i></span>
      </a></h2>
<p>Servo’s layout engine lacks crucial features for rendering languages that don’t use the Latin alphabet. This includes proper font selection, support for right-to-left scripts, and logical properties. Our aim is to improve Servo’s support for displaying a wider variety of content.</p>
<h2 id="initial-%3Ctable%3E-support" tabindex="-1">Initial &lt;table&gt; support <a href="#initial-%3Ctable%3E-support">
        <span><i></i></span>
      </a></h2>
<p>HTML tables are an important and widely used feature. Servo’s new layout engine doesn’t support tables yet, which leads to incorrect layout of many web pages. Under this scope, our main focus is to implement initial support for tables in Servo, so that it can render tables used on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>As we progress and achieve these milestones, we’ll cover them in more detail in subsequent blog posts. Stay tuned for more updates!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-framer-name="Content" data-framer-component-type="RichTextContainer"><p>Since we first introduced <!-- --><a href="https://github.com/AbanteAI/mentat" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mentat</a>, GPT-4 has been the default model. While Mentat can run with GPT-3.5 or even local models, GPT-4’s higher quality code edits are well worth the extra cost. We are excited to unlock GPT-4 Turbo's full potential — being 2-3x cheaper and having a significantly larger context — but does it match the quality of GPT-4, especially for editing code?<!-- --></p><h2>Benchmarking GPT-4 Turbo</h2><p>To answer this question, we ran both GPT-4 and GPT-4 Turbo on our <!-- --><a href="https://github.com/AbanteAI/mentat/blob/main/tests/benchmarks/exercism_practice.py" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Exercism benchmarks</a>, compiled from a set of 122 <!-- --><a href="https://exercism.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Exercism</a> programming exercises. We ran GPT-4 on each task and gave it two tries to succeed (on the second attempt, it is shown why it failed). GPT-4 ended up solving 86/122, or 70%, of the JavaScript exercises.<!-- --></p><p>Running that same benchmark with GPT-4 Turbo we got 84/122, or 68.8% of the exercises. Slightly worse, but close enough that it could just be statistical noise. But wait! Looking closer at the results there was a significant difference: GPT-4 solved 76 on the first try and only an additional 10 on the second attempt, while GPT-4 Turbo only solved 56 on the first try and solved an additional 28 on the second attempt.</p><h2>Interpreting Results</h2><p>Why would GPT-4 Turbo solve fewer tasks on the first attempt? We examined individual exercises and the code it wrote for them and found that it often wrote reasonable solutions but failed on the first attempt due to unclear or ambiguous instructions. But then how does GPT-4 solve them? Our theory was that GPT-4 had substantially memorized the Exercism training tasks, but that when GPT-4 was downsized (most likely through distillation) to GPT-4 Turbo, it lost some of this raw memorization capability.</p><p>We designed a test for this theory: we reran the benchmarks without showing the models the instructions to each exercise. Instead, we just told them that they were Exercism exercises, and gave them the exercise names and function stubs. This is not enough to solve the problem unless the model has it memorized. Due to rate limits on GPT-4 Turbo, we only ran the first 40 exercises. GPT-4 solved 23/40, or 57.5%, on the first try and an additional 5 on the second try. GPT-4 Turbo, on the other hand, only solved 12/40, or 30%, on the first try and an additional 11 on the second try. We interpret this as confirming that GPT-4 has more of the exercises memorized than GPT-4-Turbo.</p><p><img alt="" data-framer-asset="data:framer/asset-reference,aoa9JDugtTsDNSAVzXKgW8vq1o.png" data-framer-height="878" data-framer-width="1330" height="439" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/aoa9JDugtTsDNSAVzXKgW8vq1o.png" width="665"></p><p>Our results seem similar to <!-- --><a href="https://twitter.com/wangzjeff/status/1721934560919994823" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this finding</a>:<!-- --></p><p><img alt="" data-framer-asset="data:framer/asset-reference,xOoj8r4n0N1TQ4Px32I4PlhECz8.png" data-framer-height="2584" data-framer-width="1262" height="1292" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/xOoj8r4n0N1TQ4Px32I4PlhECz8.png" width="631"></p><p>Although the author OCR’ed the SAT questions and believes that they weren’t in the training data, we believe it’s fairly likely that these questions – and definitely some incredibly similar questions – ended up in the training data at some point, making the drop in GPT-4 Turbo's measured performance hard to interpret.</p><h2>Future Benchmarks</h2><p>Benchmarks derived from content in GPT’s training data are still valuable for determining how good GPT is at responding in the correct edit format, as well as comparing fine-tuned models to each other. But these results make it pretty clear that they aren’t an accurate test for comparing models trained on separate datasets or distilled models – which is what we suspect GPT-4 Turbo is.</p><p>These results emphasize the need for better benchmarks, something we've already begun building for Mentat: real world, realistic coding tasks based on recent commits to open source repositories that were made after the training cutoff. Although no benchmark will ever be perfect, we are confident that these improvements will help us gauge the relative accuracy of different models in the future.</p></div></div>]]></description>
