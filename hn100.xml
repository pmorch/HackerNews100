<p>Edit: Sorry for the people seeing it on HackerNews, didn‚Äôt post it there and it wasn‚Äôt intended for that audience ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è yes, it‚Äôs an ‚Äúimmature rant‚Äù, because it starts with ‚ÄúI have to rant about the home office situation [‚Ä¶] specifically at my place of employment‚Äù. This is not a professional article, it‚Äôs a personal blog; it was written after I was on the phone with the disability rep, talking to each other about these matters. I fear since this isn‚Äôt the US private sector I‚Äôm talking about, it may not match your experiences.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have to rant about the home office situation in general, but also specifically at my place of employment and similar places.</p>
<p>I cannot stand the fake positivity and cute-sounding arguments for returning to the office. It falls flat for so many and it‚Äôs trying to make it sound more legitimate by evoking this image of collaboration, being social, kindness, having a good time together when that‚Äôs not the point. The point is micromanagement and needing to justify the large office spaces they invested into. Very rarely are there positions or departments who truly need to collab in person, and then they can just do that for the occasion, not a fixed amount of days per week or month where they need to go in at all times.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs a joke. At my place, we don‚Äôt innovate, we don‚Äôt develop new products for a mass market; we do lots of data entry, emails, and writing reports in SharePoint or with comments and track changes in Word. Excel spreadsheets and databases. Absolutely everything is digitized, we send auto-emails and all communication is via Teams or Mail and very rarely over phone. Documents arrive digitally. All the collaboration is already online and there is no need for an office presence. Even when you are in office, you don‚Äôt even see the people for the work since it‚Äôs all online!</p>
<p>But they‚Äôll look at FAANG and be like: ‚ÄúOoh, they‚Äôre asking everyone to be back at the office because of better collaboration!‚Äù You clown, the collaboration happens the same regardless where my ass sits and we are not designers or knowledge workers solving issues, we handle data! We are not pioneers or a Silicon Valley tech firm!</p>
<p>Asking everyone back to the office for the supposed social aspect is truly the fruit-bowl-ification of it all. It‚Äôs about as convincing to work for you as the mention of the kicker table in your job listings. I like my coworkers, and I call them often just to talk, or create Teams meetings just to catch up in private matters and not a work meeting. But asking people back into the office to be more social and combat supposed isolation is dumb! The people who need this are not prevented to come in and do just that anyway. But you‚Äôre asking people to waste fuel and time commuting there, tired, sitting their ass off at a table for that? You‚Äôre asking me as an immunocompromised and chronically ill person in pain and dealing with fatigue to show up and do the same stuff I do at home so others can play family at work?</p>
<p>Babes, I am less social with the office than without. When I come home from the office I lie in bed and that‚Äôs it. I am drained. I haven‚Äôt had the time or energy to see the people I truly care about much. This isolates me more. When I get sick from it (like last year at the Christmas function when someone brought Covid!) I am isolated at home. And for what, so people who insist on office time have someone they see in the hallway on the way to the toilet?</p>
<p>They haven‚Äôt taken it away yet, but the threat seems to always be there and often serves as a way to enact pressure or as a bargaining chip. Behave or we can‚Äôt do that anymore, it‚Äôs a privilege not a right, we do this out of goodwill, some people abuse this and so on.</p>
<p>Home office is the only way for many people to have a decent work output because family, household, caretaking, further education, illness and free time activities are better taken care of this way and people can work focused in silence without noise and interruption.  It lessens stress and burnout and allows people to see more of their loved ones - much more meaningful socially than office interactions.</p>
<p>If I hadn‚Äôt had home office possibilities, I would‚Äôve been gone from work for 8 months minimum due to my illness. But this way, I was still able to do the daily work, launch new features needed in our database, sign stuff as a representative and more. Home office is so important for disabled and chronically ill people to get and retain employment, and team members and coworkers deserve it as well to not have to take over someone else‚Äôs work for so long just because of a refusal to let people work from home. You cannot dangle what people need to effectively work in front of them like a carrot and subtly threaten to take it away. It‚Äôs ableist. You wouldn‚Äôt dare to do that with elevators or other accessibility features at the office, so don‚Äôt do it with that either.</p>
<p>And that‚Äôs also what I sent the staff council and our disability representative at work. So far, I received positive feedback for that.</p>
<p>The past few years but especially this year, I saw my coworkers bust their ass to make it all work. More work, more responsibilities, no extra hires, no pay increase. I busted my ass to make it all work despite my illness. Twice in a row in my three years in that spot, I got a performance bonus for my great work. Well, they told us all this year there won‚Äôt be any for anyone despite it all.</p>
<p>If they take away or severely limit home office too, I‚Äôm throwing, man. Then do your shit alone and drive all the young capable people away, in the place where like 50% of the work force will retire in the next 5 years. Fuck around and find out.</p>

<p>Each image is actually a mosaic of 25 high-resolution shots snapped by the Solar Orbiter mission on March 22, 2023. The spacecraft captured all 100 total images when it was less than 46 million miles from the sun. The process took more than four hours, since the spacecraft had to change position for each individual photograph. In the final mosaics, the sun‚Äôs diameter is almost 8,000 pixels across.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Solar_Orbiter">Solar Orbiter</a> is a joint mission between the ESA and NASA, operated by the ESA, that launched in February 2020 and released its first images the <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/see-our-suns-surface-unprecedented-detail-180975380/">following July</a>. Since its launch, the program has hit many milestones, capturing both the closest-ever images of the sun and the first close-up images of its polar regions.</p>

<p>While the spacecraft totes six <a href="https://www.esa.int/ESA_Multimedia/Images/2020/01/Solar_Orbiter_s_instruments">imaging instruments</a>, the newly released images were captured with just two: the Polarimetric and Helioseismic Imager (PHI) and the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI). The PHI is responsible for three of the new solar views‚Äîan image in visible light, a map of the direction of the magnetic field and a velocity map featuring the speed and direction of parts of the sun‚Äôs surface. The EUI, meanwhile, produced an image of our star‚Äôs outer atmosphere, called the corona, in ultraviolet light.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThese new high-resolution maps from Solar Orbiter‚Äôs PHI instrument show the beauty of the sun‚Äôs surface magnetic field and flows in great detail. At the same time, they are crucial for inferring the magnetic field in the sun‚Äôs hot corona, which our EUI instrument is imaging,‚Äù <a href="https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/personal-profiles/daniel-mueller">Daniel M√ºller</a>, a Solar Orbiter project scientist with the ESA, says in a <a href="https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Solar_Orbiter/New_full_Sun_views_show_sunspots_fields_and_restless_plasma">statement</a>. ‚ÄúThe sun‚Äôs magnetic field is key to understanding the dynamic nature of our home star from the smallest to the largest scales.‚Äù</p>

<p>The four images offer a high-definition tour of the sun. First, the visible light image below depicts the star‚Äôs constantly moving surface of hot plasma‚Äîor charged gas, simply put. This layer has a temperature between 8,132 and 10,832 degrees Fahrenheit and emits most of the sun‚Äôs radiation.</p>

<p>Beneath the surface is the sun‚Äôs convection zone, in which dense plasma swirls around, rather like the magma in Earth‚Äôs mantle. This phenomenon makes the sun‚Äôs surface look grainy, and scientists say the star‚Äôs magnetic field is <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/researchers-trace-the-origin-of-the-suns-magnetic-field-shedding-light-on-space-weather-and-solar-cycles-180984410/">driven by the churning plasma</a>.</p>

<p>Dark shapes called sunspots are seen in both PHI‚Äôs visible light image and its magnetic map, shown below. The sun‚Äôs <a href="https://www.weather.gov/fsd/sunspots#:~:text=Sunspots%3A%20One%20interesting%20aspect%20of,anywhere%20else%20on%20the%20Sun.">magnetic field is stronger at the sunspots</a>, with red in the image indicating where it moves outward and blue indicating where it moves inward.</p>

<p><a href="https://science.nasa.gov/sun/sunspots/">Sunspots</a> are concentrated tangles of magnetic fields, where plasma is diverted from the sun‚Äôs heat-mixing convective flow, making it cooler than surrounding areas. As a result, the plasma in sunspots gives off less light and appears dark in the visible light image.</p>

<h2>1.0 Introduction</h2>

<p>
SQLite is a TCL extension that has escaped into the wild.


</p><p>
The design of SQLite was inspired by the design of TCL, both in
the way it handles datatypes and in the formatting of its source
code.
The index use case for SQLite was in a Tcl/Tk application for an
industrial company.
From its inception, SQLite has always depended heavily on TCL.
These days, SQLite no longer uses TCL internally and can be run
separately from any TCL interpreter, and yet the SQLite development
process still depends heavily on TCL.
</p>

<h3>1.1 About SQLite</h3>

<p>
SQLite is an SQL database engine, and 
the most widely used database engine in the world.
SQLite is built into all cellphones as a core component and is the
primary means of data persistence on phones.  SQLite is also an
integral part of most web browsers.  SQLite is built into MacOS and
is used by most of the default applications on that platform.
Windows10 requires the C:\Windows\System32\winsqlite3.dll file in
order to boot.  Countless other popular applications like Skype 
and WhatsApp and iTunes depend on SQLite.

</p><p>
Because SQLite is open source and can be freely downloaded and
duplicated, exact usage numbers are unavailable.  But reasonable
estimates are that there are more SQLite instances in operation
today than there are people on earth.  Most devices that
use the SQLite database engine contain hundreds of separate databases,
and there are billions of such devices.  Hence, there are likely
around one trillion SQLite databases in active use.

</p><p>
There are more copies of SQLite in use than there are copies of Linux.
We know this because SQLite is used on almost all Linux systems, but
SQLite is also used on many other non-linux systems such as Macs, iPhones,
and Windows computers.
By similar arguments, there are more copies of SQLite in use than
there are Macs, or Windows PCs.
There are probably more copies of SQLite in use than all other database
engines combined.
It seems likely that SQLite is the most widely used and deployed
software component of any kind, with the possible exception of the
zLib compression library.

</p><h3>1.2 SQLite Is A TCL Extension, Not A TCL Application</h3>

<p>
SQLite is not written in TCL.  Rather, SQLite is intended to be used
by TCL.  Like the TCL interpreter, SQLite is written in ANSI C.

</p><p>
The fact that SQLite was primarily intended to be used from TCL
is evident in an number of ways.

</p><p>
All programming languages, other than C/C++, require some kind of
adaptor in order to interface with the SQLite C implementation.  Language
adaptors for SQLite are widely available from third party programmers.
The adaptors for PHP and Python are built into those languages, for
example.  A Java adaptor is baked into Android.  And so forth.  Only
the TCL adaptor is included as part of the SQLite core.  The source code
file that implements the TCL adaptor for SQLite, "tclsqlite.c",
was part of the very first check-in on the SQLite source repository
on 2000-05-29.  (See 
<a href="https://sqlite.org/src/ci/6f3655f79f9b6fc9">https://sqlite.org/src/ci/6f3655f79f9b6fc9</a>.)

</p><p>
All modern SQL implementations provide a means to do late binding of
parameter values to the SQL statements.  Usually a naked "?" character,
or a "?" followed by an integer is used.  For example:

</p><blockquote><pre>SELECT passwd, photo FROM user WHERE uid=<b>?1</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
The "?1" token in the SQL above would be assigned a value at run-time
in order to look up the password and photograph of a particular user.

</p><p>
SQLite supports this syntax.  But because of its TCL heritage, SQLite
also allows the parameter to take the form of a TCL variable.  Hence:

</p><blockquote><pre>SELECT passwd, photo FROM user WHERE uid=<b>$uid</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
When a statement such as the above is run, the TCL language adaptor
automatically binds the value of the $uid TCL variable to the SQL statement
before it is evaluated, providing an intuitive and seamless interface
between TCL and SQL.  SQLite is the only database engine that behaves
this way.

</p><p>
The TCL heritage of SQLite is visible in the type system of
SQLite.  Early versions of SQLite (prior to 2004) operated on the classic
TCL principal that "everything is a string".  Beginning with SQLite3
(2004-06-18), SQLite also supports binary data.  However, types are still
very flexible in SQLite, just as they are in TCL.  SQLite treats the datatypes
on column names in a CREATE TABLE statement as suggestions rather than
hard requirements.  SQLite is happy to store a 100KB string value in a
column that is declared "SHORT INT", just as TCL is happy to store either
a large string or a small integer in the same variable.  There are some
differences in how SQLite deals with datatypes, in comparison to TCL, due
to the different nature of the SQL language.  SQLite has the concept of
"type affinity".  If a column is declared "INT" and one inserts a string
into that column that looks like an integer and can be safely converted into
an integer without loss of information, then that conversion occurs
automatically.  This provides a measure of compatibility with the rigid
type systems of other SQL database engines.

</p><p>
The flexible type system of SQLite seems natural and intuitive to programmers
with prior experience programming in TCL.  Curiously, though, it is a source
of frustration and frequent complaining from programmers accustomed to the
rigid and unforgiving type systems of languages like Java.

</p><p>
The similarities in the type systems of TCL and SQLite extends to more than
just the interface.  An important part of the C/C++ interface for SQLite
is the "sqlite3_value" object
(<a href="https://sqlite.org/c3ref/value.html">https://sqlite.org/c3ref/value.html</a>) which is analogous to the
Tcl_Obj object in TCL.  Both TCL and SQLite use a dual-representation approach,
where each value can be represented simultaneously as both a string and
some other type.

</p><h2>2.0 How SQLite Depends On Tcl</h2>

<p>
SQLite began as a TCL extension, though these days most uses of SQLite
are in applications written in languages other than TCL.  Many programmers
who use SQLite in their applications have no knowledge or awareness of TCL.
The SQLite source code used by most developers is a single file of pure
C code named "sqlite3.c" that contains no TCL code.  
This is what we mean when we
say that SQLite as "escaped" into the wild.  Deployed instances of SQLite
no longer depends on TCL.

</p><p>
Nevertheless, SQLite is still heavily dependent upon TCL and the ongoing
support, maintenance, and enhancement of SQLite would not be possible without
TCL, and would be seriously inconvenienced without Tk.


</p><h3>2.1 SQLite Source Code Is Mostly TCL</h3>

<p>
The deliverable source code for SQLite is a single file named
"sqlite3.c" and its companion header "sqlite3.h".
Both files are 100% ANSI-C code.  But developers do not edit these
files directly.  The sqlite3.c and sqlite3.h source files are build
products, and the source tree used to build those files is over 50%
TCL code.  Figure 1 nearby shows the exact ratios.

</p><center>
<img src="https://www.tcl.tk/community/tcl2017/assets/talk93/fig01.jpg" width="40%"><br>
<b>Figure 1: Breakdown Of SQLite Source Code By Language</b>
</center>

<p>
Figure 1 is for the main SQLite source repository.  Many of the test
cases and much of the documentation is held in separate repositories,
not included in Figure 1.  The separate repositories also contain a great
deal of TCL code.

</p><p>
Much of the TCL code in the main SQLite repository consists of test scripts.
At this writing, the core repository contains 1153 separate test scripts
totally about 389 KB of space.
But this is not the only use of TCL in SQLite.

</p><h3>2.2 Machine Generated C Code</h3>

<p>
A non-trivial amount of the deliverable C code for SQLite is machine
generated.  Some of the machine generated code is created by C programs,
such as LEMON which translates the SQL language grammar into C code to
implement a push-down automaton to parse the SQL language.  But much of
the automatically generated code is created using TCL scripts.  TCL is
well suited for scanning source files to extract information to be
merged with other files and for making mechanized edits.  For example,
the byte-code engine used to evaluate SQL statements inside of SQLite
is implemented as a large "switch" statement inside a "for" loop, with a
separate "case" for each opcode, all in the "vdbe.c" source file.
At build-time, TCL scripts scan the vdbe.c source file looking for the
appropriate "case" statements and then build header files that assign
consecutive integers to each symbolic opcode name.  (The opcodes used by
the SQLite byte-code engine are not an API as they are in TCL and thus
can change from one build to the next.)  This mapping of symbolic opcode
names into integers is not a simple as one might suppose.  For reasons
of optimization, there are many constraints on the specific values that
are assigned to opcodes.  For example, many opcodes such as OP_Add must
have the same numeric value as the corresponding "+" token in the SQL
language parser.  Sometimes a group of related opcodes, such as the
comparison operators OP_Eq, OP_Ne, OP_Lt, OP_Le, OP_Ge, and OP_Gt, need
to be assigned consecutive integers in a specific order.  These constraints
are all handled effortlessly in TCL.  Accomplishing the
same with AWK would be rather more difficult.

</p><p>
Perhaps the most important task for TCL during the SQLite build process
is constructing the SQLite amalgamation source code file.
Recall that most developers use SQLite in the form of a single big file
of C code named "sqlite3.c" and referred to as "the amalgamation".
A TCL script named "mksqlite3c.tcl" runs in order to construct the
amalgamation from over one hundred separate input files.  Each of these
inputs files must be added to the amalgamation in just the right order.
Furthermore, the source files are edited as part of the amalgamation building
process.  When mksqlite3c.tcl encounters a "#include" for an SQLite header,
it replaces the "#include" with a copy of that header file, taking care
to make sure each header file is only included once.  The mksqlite3.tcl
script automatically adds the "static" keyword to internal SQLite APIs
to give them file linkage, and makes other similar edits.

</p><h3>2.3 The sqlite3_analyzer.exe Utility</h3>

<p>
In addition to the core SQLite library, the SQLite source tree also contains
code for several analysis and control programs.  One of these programs
is called "sqlite3_analyzer" (or "sqlite3_analyzer.exe" on Windows).
The sqlite3_analyzer program examines an SQLite database and generates
a detailed report on the disk usage by the various tables and indexes
within that database.  The sqlite3_analyzer program is very useful in
understanding how an application is using disk space.

</p><p>
It turns out that sqlite3_analyzer, though disguised as an ordinary
executable, is really a TCL application.  The main source code file for
this application is
<a href="https://sqlite.org/src/file/tool/spaceanal.tcl">tool/spaceanal.tcl</a>.
During the build process, this script is converted into a C-language
string constant (using another TCL script) and added to a very simple
C-language wrapper than starts a TCL interpreter and then passes the
application script to that interpreter.

</p><p>
The sqlite3_analyzer program could be rewritten in pure C.  But that
would be a lot of code.  The TCL script that implements sqlite3_analyzer is
less than 1000 lines long.  The equivalent C program would surely be at
least ten times larger.

</p><p>
Note that the sqlite3_analyzer utility program statically links a TCL
interpreter and so does not require a TCL installation on the target
computer to use.  The sqlite3_analyzer utility program is used by
tens of thousands of developers, most of whom do not realize that they
are really running a TCL application.

</p><h3>2.4 TCL Used For Testing SQLite</h3>

<p>
One of the key features of SQLite is that it uses aviation-grade testing.
The tests of SQLite, at a minimum, provide 100% modified condition/decision
coverage (MC/DC) of the SQLite code, with independence.  100% MC/DC roughly
means that every branch instruction at the machine code level is exercised
at least once in each direction.  The precise definition of
MC/DC is slightly stricter than this, for example when comparing boolean
vectors, but the 100% branch tests coverage definition is very close
approximation.  The "with independence" term means that SQLite is tested
in multiple ways with test code being written and maintained by different
individuals.

</p><p>
The amount of testing done on SQLite is fanatical.  On the other hand,
that level of testing is necessary for a fundamental low-level component,
such as a database engine, that is used by billions of devices.  If an
ordinary application encounters an obscure bug, it can normally be rebooted 
to clear the problem.  But the job of a database engine is to remember things,
and so databases tend to remember their mistakes across reboots.  For these
reasons, it is important that SQLite have a very low bug density.

</p><p>
TCL is used in every aspect of SQLite testing.
The test cases that are part of the primary SQLite source code
repository are written in TCL.
Other test cases such as 
<a href="https://sqlite.org/th3.html">TH3</a> and
<a href="https://sqlite.org/sqllogictest">SQLLogicTest</a> are written
in C but still depend on TCL for operation.

</p><p>
The TH3 test suite is a set of proprietary tests for SQLite that form the
primary means of achieving 100% MC/DC.  TH3 is designed to
run on embedded hardware without the support of a desktop operating system.
TH3 consists of over 1350 test modules together with over 100 control files.
The test modules are written in either C or SQL or a combination of both.
The control files are text formatted in a way that easily parsed by TCL.
To build a TH3 test, a TCL script is run that combines some subset of the
test modules and control files into a single large C program that will
automatically run the required tests.  This C program is then linked against
the "sqlite3.c" amalgamation and the resulting binary is moved to the target
computer and executed.  TCL scripts automate this entire process on
all major host platforms.

</p><p>
To verify that the TH3 tests really do provide 100% MC/DC, special options
are added to the TCL scripts that run the tests, causing the GCC coverage
analysis tools to be invoked.  The output of gcov is then postprocessed to
reveal and report any branch instructions that were missed by the tests.
The TH3 tests themselves are all implemented in C and SQL, but the operation
and management of those tests is all done with TCL.

</p><h3>2.5 TCL Generated Documentation</h3>

<p>
The extensive documentation for SQLite available on the SQLite website
(<a href="https://sqlite.org/">https://sqlite.org/</a>) is all generated
by TCL.  Many of the documents, such as the API reference documentation and
the descriptions of the byte-code engine opcodes, are created by TCL scripts
that scan C source code and extract the necessary information from the code
and comments.  Thus, the API documentation is largely derived from
comments in the source code.  Keeping the official documentation (in
comments) and the source code close together helps ensure that they are
in agreement.

</p><p>
Other whitepaper documents are generated from source files that look 
mostly like
HTML but which contain additional TCL code embedded inside of
&lt;tcl&gt;...&lt;/tcl&gt; markup.  The added TCL code is used for
advanced formatting techniques, for automatically creating cross-references
and cross-links, and for constructing complex displays such as the
popular "rail-road" syntax diagrams for SQL.

</p><h3>2.6 Tcl/Tk Used During Development Of SQLite</h3>

<p>
The text editor used by the primary author of SQLite is a custom editor
with emacs-style key bindings that is built on top of the Tk Text widget.
The "e" editor, as it is called, is cross-platform, which helps in the
development of a cross-platform software library like SQLite.  The "e"
editor has been used for the entire 17-year history of SQLite.  It has
been enhanced over the years with various customizations created especially
to help manage the SQLite source code.

</p><p>
The Fossil version control system used for the SQLite source code
(and written specifically for that purpose) uses Tcl/Tk to show graphical
side-by-side diffs in a separate window.  When the "fossil diff --tk"
command is run, Fossil generates a script to show the diff graphically
and then kicks off a separate "wish" process to run that script and
display the diff in a separate window.  This graphical diff window has
a "Save" button which will cause the Tcl/Tk code needed to reproduce itself
to be written to a file.  This file can be, in turn, sent to a collaborator
for display.  Passing around graphical diffs as ordinary text files is
much simpler and easier than passing around JPEG images or text "context"
diffs.

</p><p>
No two SQLite developers work in the same office.  The team is
geographically distributed.  To help the team stay in touch, a custom
chatroom has been created using a Tcl/Tk script.  The same script works
as both client and server.  The chatroom is private and uses a proprietary
protocol, so that developers are free to discuss sensitive matters without
fear of eavesdropping.  The chatroom is implemented as just over
1000 lines of Tk code, and is thus accessible and easy to customize.
Among the customizations is the ability to send saved "fossil diff --tk"
graphical diffs to collaborators and have the diff pop automatically on
the collaborators screen.  Small features like this seem trivial
by themselves, but together than help the developers
to work much more efficiently.  These kinds of productivity-enhancing
features are unavailable to users of commercial business collaboration 
packages such as HipChat.

</p><h2>3.0 Summary</h2>

<p>
SQLite is an indispensable element of most modern computer systems, and
TCL is an indispensable tool used in the production and maintenance of
SQLite.  Thus, the computing infrastructure we enjoy today would not exist
except for TCL.

</p><p>
As deployed, SQLite contains no TCL code.
However, the design of SQLite is inspired by TCL.
And TCL is used extensively in the code generation, testing,
analysis, documentation, and development of SQLite.  Without
TCL, SQLite would not exist.

</p><p>
Every developer and every team has a finite number of "brain cycles"
available to do their job.  The fewer cycles spent messing with tools,
the more cycles are available to devote towards solving the problem.
So for maximum productivity, it is important to use tools that get
the job done with a minimum of fuss and bother.
Our 17-year experience using TCL in the SQLite project has convinced
us that TCL is just such a tool.  Tcl provides the most help per
brain cycle of any similar technology.

<p>
       June 30, 2012</p>
   <a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/quake3/qvm.php">
   </a><div id="paperbox"><p><a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/quake3/qvm.php">
	   	
          </a><a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/quake3/index.php">
          <img src="https://fabiensanglard.net/quake3/quake3_icon.jpg">   
          </a> 
         

The network model of Quake3 is with no doubt the most elegant part of the engine. At the lower level Quake III still abstract communications
with the <a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/quakeSource/quakeSourceNetWork.php">NetChannel module that first appeared in Quake World</a>.
The most important thing to understand is:</p><p>
In a fast paced environment any information that is not received on first transmission is not worth sending again because it will be too old anyway.</p><p>

As a result the engine relies essentially on UDP/IP: There is no trace of TCP/IP anywhere since the "Reliable transmission" 
aspect introduced intolerable latency. The network stack has been augmented with two mutually exclusive layers:
</p></div><ul>
    <li>Encryption using preshared key.</li>
    <li>Compression with pre-computed huffman key.</li>
</ul>
<div>

<p><img src="https://fabiensanglard.net/lazy_load/grey.gif" data-original="/fd_proxy/quake3/q3_netstack.png"></p><p>

But where the design really shine is on the server side where an elegant system minimize the size of each UDP datagram while 
compensating for the unreliablity of UDP:
An history of snapshots generate deltas packets via memory introspection.

</p></div>



<h3>Architecture</h3>
<div id="paperbox"><p>
The Client side of the network model is fairly simple: Client sends commands to the Server each frame and receive update for the gamestate. The Server side is as bit more complex since it has to propagate the Master gamestate to each Client while accounting for lost UDP packets. This mechanism features three key elements:<br>
<img src="https://fabiensanglard.net/lazy_load/grey.gif" data-original="/fd_proxy/quake3/q3_network_archi.png"></p></div><ul>
  <li>A <b>Master Gamestate</b> that is the universal true state of things. Clients send theirs commands on the Netchannel. They are transformed in event_t which will modifiy the state of the game when they arrive on the Server.</li>
  <li>For each Client the server keeps the <b>32 last gamestate</b> sent over the network in a cycling array: They are called snapshots. The array cycle with the famous binary mask trick I mentioned in Quake World Network (<a href="http://fabiensanglard.net/quakeSource/quakeSourceNetWork.php">Some elegant things</a>).</li>
  <li>The server also features <b>a "dummy" gamestate</b> with every single field set to zero. This is used to delta snapshots when there is no "previous state" available.</li>
 </ul>
 <div><p>
When the server decides to send an update to a client it uses each three elements in order to generate a message that is then carried over the NetChannel.</p><u><b>Trivia :</b></u><p> To keep so many gamestate for each players consumes a lot of memory: 8 MB for 4 players according to my measurements.  
</p></div>


<h3>Snapshot systems</h3>
<p id="paperbox">
In order to understand the snapshop system, here is an example with the following conditions:
</p><ul>
    <li>The server is sending update to a Client1.</li>
    <li>The server is attempting to propagate the state of Client2 which has four 4  fields (3 ints position[X], position[Y], position[Z] and one int health).</li>
    <li>Communication are done over UDP/IP: Those messages gets lost quite often on the internet.</li>
</ul>
<div>
<u>Server Frame 1:</u><p>

The Server has received a few updates from every client. They have impacted the Master gamestate (in green). It is now time to propagate the state to Client1:
<img src="https://fabiensanglard.net/lazy_load/grey.gif" data-original="/fd_proxy/quake3/q3_network_t1.png"></p><p>

In order to generate a message the network module will ALWAYS do the following :
</p></div><ol>
   <li>Copy the Master gamestate in the next Client history slot.</li>
   <li>Compare it with an other snapshot.</li>
</ol>
<p>
This is what we can see in the next drawing:
</p><ol>
   <li> Master gamestate is copied at index 0 in Client1 history: It is now called"Snapshot1".</li>
   <li> Since this is the first udpate, there are no valid snapshot in Client1 history so the engine is going to use the "Dummy snapshot" where all fields are always ZEROed. This results in a FULL update since every single field is sent to the NetChannel.</li>
 </ol>
 <div>
<p><img src="https://fabiensanglard.net/lazy_load/grey.gif" data-original="/fd_proxy/quake3/q3_network_t2.png"><br>
The key point to understand here is that if no valid snapshots are available in the client history the engine will pick "dummy snapshot" to
 generate a delta message. This will result in a full udpate sent to the Client using 132 bits (each field is <a href="https://github.com/id-Software/Quake-III-Arena/blob/master/code/qcommon/msg.c#L1200">
preceeded by a bit marker</a>): <code>[1 A_on32bits 1 B_on32bits 1 B_on32bits 1 C_on32bits]</code>.
</p><u>Server Frame 2:</u><p>

Now let's move forward in time: this is the Server second frame. As we can see each client have sent commands and they have impacted the Master gamestate: Client2 has moved on the Y axis so pos[1] is now equal to E (in blue). Client1 has also sent commands but more important it has also acknowledged receiving the previous udpate so Snapshot1 has been marked as "ACK":
<img src="https://fabiensanglard.net/lazy_load/grey.gif" data-original="/fd_proxy/quake3/q3_network_t3.png"><br>

The process is the same:</p></div><ol>
   <li>Copy the Master gamestate in the next Client history slot: (index 1): This is Snapshot2</li>
   <li>This time we have a valid snapshot in the client history (snapshot1). Compare those two snapshots</li>
</ol>
<div><p>
As result only a partial update (   pos[1] = E ) is sent over the network. This is the beauty of the design: The process is always the same.
<img src="https://fabiensanglard.net/lazy_load/grey.gif" data-original="/fd_proxy/quake3/q3_network_t4.png"></p><u>Note :</u><p> Since each field is <a href="https://github.com/id-Software/Quake-III-Arena/blob/master/code/qcommon/msg.c#L1200">
preceeded by a bit marker</a> (1=changed, 0=not changed) the partial update above would uses 36 bits: <code>[0 1 32bitsNewValue 0 0]</code>. 
</p><u>Server Frame 3:</u><p>

Let's move forward one more step in order to see how the system deals with lost packets. This is now Frame 3. Clients have kept on sending commands to the server.
Client2 has lost life and health is now equal to H. But Client1 has not acknowledged the last update. Maybe the Server's UDP got lost, maybe the ACK from the Client
got lost but bottom line is that it cannot be used.

<img src="https://fabiensanglard.net/lazy_load/grey.gif" data-original="/fd_proxy/quake3/q3_network_t5.png"></p><p>


Regardless the process remains the same:
</p></div><ol>
   <li>Copy the Master gamestate in the next Client history slot: (index 2): This is Snapshot3</li>
   <li>Compare with the last valid acknowledged snapshot (snapshot1).</li>
</ol>
<div>
<p><img src="https://fabiensanglard.net/lazy_load/grey.gif" data-original="/fd_proxy/quake3/q3_network_t6.png"></p><p>

As a result the message sent it partial and contains a combination of old changes and new changes: (pos[1]=E and health=H). Note that snapshot1 could have been too old to be used. In this case the engine would have used the "dummy snapshot" again, resulting in a full update.</p><p>

The beauty and elegance of the system resides in its simplicity. The same algorithm automatically:
</p></div><ul>
   <li>Generate partial or full update.</li>
   <li>Resend OLD information that were not received and NEW information in a single message.</li>
</ul>



<h3>Memory introspection with C</h3>
<div id="paperbox"><p>
You may wonder how Quake3 is comparing snapshots with introspection...since C does not have introspection.<br>
The answer is that each field locations for a <code>netField_t</code> is preconstructed via an array and some clever 
preprocessing directives:</p></div><pre>

    typedef struct {
        <span>char</span>    *name;
        <span>int</span>     offset;
        <span>int</span>     bits;
    } netField_t; 

    // using the stringizing operator to save typing...
    #define	NETF(x) #x,(<span>int</span>)&amp;((entityState_t*)0)-&gt;x

    netField_t	entityStateFields[] = 
    {
    { NETF(pos.trTime), <span>32</span> },
    { NETF(pos.trBase[0]), <span>0</span> },
    { NETF(pos.trBase[1]), <span>0</span> },
    ...
    }

</pre>
<div><p>
The full code of this part can be found in <a href="https://github.com/id-Software/Quake-III-Arena/blob/master/code/qcommon/msg.c">snapshot.c</a>'s 
<code>MSG_WriteDeltaEntity</code>. Quake3 does not even know what it is comparing: It just blindly follow <code>entityStateFields</code>'s index,offset and size...and
sends the difference over the network.

</p></div>





<h3>Pre-fragmentation</h3>
<p id="paperbox">
Digging into the code we see that the NetChannel module slices messages in chunks of 1400 bytes (<a href="https://github.com/id-Software/Quake-III-Arena/blob/master/code/qcommon/net_chan.c">
<code>Netchan_Transmit</code></a>), even though the maximum size of an UDP datagram is 65507 bytes. Doing so the engine avoid having its packets
fragmented by routers while traveling over the internet since most network MTU are 1500 bytes. Avoiding router fragmentation is very important since:<br>
</p><ul>
   <li>Upon entering the network the router must block the packet while it is fragmenting it.</li>
   <li>Upon leaving the network problems are even worse since every part of the datagram have to be waited on and then time-costly re-assembled.</li>
</ul>










<h3>Reliable and Unreliable messages</h3>
<div id="paperbox"><p>
If the snapshot system compensate for UDP datagrams lost over the network,  some messages and commands must be GUARANTEED to be delivered (when
a player quits or when the Server needs the Client to load a new level).</p><p>

	This guarantee is abstracted by the NetChannel: I wrote about it <a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/quakeSource/quakeSourceNetWork.php">a few years ago</a> (wow my drawings have come a long way !!).
</p></div>

<hr id="bkmrk-"><h5 id="bkmrk-yes-the-maxx-interac"><em><strong>MaXX Interactive Desktop is the little brother of the great SGI Desktop on IRIX<br></strong></em></h5>

<p id="bkmrk-maxx-desktop-v2.1.1-"><strong>MaXXdesktop v2.2.0 (alpha) running in Modern Look &amp; Feel with Indigo Magic SGI Scheme (4K @120Hz)</strong></p>

<h3 id="bkmrk-introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p id="bkmrk-the-maxx-interactive">The MaXX Interactive Desktop a.k.a. MaXX<strong>desktop</strong> is the continuation of the 5Dwm project released many years back. So don't be mistaken, there is only one real&nbsp; re-implementation of the IRIX Interactive Desktop found on SGI systems, and&nbsp; it's MaXX<strong>desktop</strong>!</p>
<p id="bkmrk-maxx-desktop-is-a-tr">MaXX<strong>desktop</strong> is a true re-implementation of the "SGI Desktop" with the added benefits of using a modern software stack of highly tuned loosely-coupled components delivering maximum performance and stability while using as little resources as possible. We believe that high performance&nbsp; computing and energy friendly are not mutually exclusive. What if you could run applications in a smarter, greener and sustainable way? MaXX<strong>desktop</strong> aims at improving just that, do more with less.</p>
<p id="bkmrk-while-respecting-the">While respecting the original retro CLASSIC SGI look and feel, which is very important for us to get it right,&nbsp; we created a newer and more modern user experience called the MODERN look that feels like a natural evolution of the original SGI look, as if SGI did it themselves throughout the years perfecting an already pretty awesome recipe. The MODERN look still supports SGI Colour Schemes but introduce Unicode and UTF-8 support, anti-aliased font rendering, more hardware acceleration and a new virtual-desktop manager. The user can switch between looks with one mouse-click, now that's cool.</p>
<h3 id="bkmrk-goals-and-features-l">Goals and Features List</h3>
<p id="bkmrk-so-there-is-no-surpr">We believe in the need of&nbsp; a highly tuned workstation environment where performance, robustness, low resources consumption are at the core of everything.</p>
<p id="bkmrk-here-are-the-goals-w">Here are the goals we want to achieve and features that makes a great modern desktop:</p>
<ul id="bkmrk-it%27s-learn%2C-very-fas"><li>Lean, very fast and robust. Basically MaXX<strong>desktop</strong> gets out of your way.</li>
<li>Smart and efficient multi-cores workload management with CPU and Core partitioning which help reduce process bouncing of&nbsp; CPU cores and computation resources allocation/partitioning translate in better throughput (<a title="MaXX Scope" href="https://docs.maxxinteractive.com/books/software-architecture/page/maxx-scope" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MaXXscope</a>).</li>
<li>Built on solid and time proven foundations.</li>
<li>Desktop Applications are distributed as self contained AppImages.</li>
<li>Provides a robust modern and high performance asynchronous multi-threaded messaging sub-system (with Shared Memory support and Zero copy principle for local communications) for fast and efficient inter-processes communications (<a title="MaXX Links" href="https://docs.maxxinteractive.com/books/software-architecture/page/maxx-links" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MaXXlinks</a>).</li>
<li>Based on a modular micro-services like architecture that allow decentralization of core desktop services as we rapidly moving toward containerization for better security.</li>
<li>Modern Configuration Management sub-system with both a command line interface (CLI) or C/C++/Java API for easy application integration (<a title="MaXX Settings" href="https://docs.maxxinteractive.com/books/software-architecture/page/maxx-settings" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MaXXsettings</a>).</li>
<li>Highly focused on facilitating quick and easy access to your content with fast content previewers right from the file-manager.</li>
<li>Leverage hardware acceleration and optimization for CPU&nbsp; and GPU.</li>
<li>Centralized system monitoring sub-system (<a title="MaXX Monitor" href="https://docs.maxxinteractive.com/books/software-architecture/page/maxx-monitor">MaXXmonitor</a>).</li>
<li>HiDPI supports for X/Motif applications and easy presets control for applications.</li>
<li>Much needed Motif<sup>TM</sup> face-lift and modernization of the ViewKit framework with new modern components that are fully integrated with all MaXX Desktop sub-systems.</li>

<h3 id="bkmrk-our-mission">Our Mission</h3>
<p id="bkmrk-more-for-your-creati"><em>More for your creativity.</em></p>
<p id="bkmrk-our-goal-is-to-bring">Our mission is to bring back this great user experience which focused on performance, stability and productivity while sporting a smooth-clean-minimalism look and feel with low-resources consumption. A <strong>smart</strong> and <strong>green</strong> Desktop that puts the user's application in the forefront.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p id="bkmrk-we-believe-in-a-high">We believe in a High Performance Desktop Environment that provides the right set of tools to maximize creativity and productivity without sacrificing&nbsp; your system resources to some eye candy nonsense.&nbsp;<em> <strong>Again, less is more...

<p id="bkmrk-our-design-philosoph"><em>Our design philosophy is simple, do more with less...</em></p>
<p id="bkmrk-maxx-desktop-is-desi">The MaXX<strong>desktop</strong> is designed from the ground up for speed,&nbsp; fast/responsive, lightweight/simplicity over eye-candidness, but more importantly, to get the heck out of your way... The name <em>MaXX Interactive</em> doesn't mean maximum visual interaction, which are distractions or so what we call, UI noises. It's means maximum creativity with interactive assistance from the Desktop. In many ways, it's made for you and your brain so that it can relax, focus on let the creative juice flowing with far fewer distractions. We see desktop notifications in a very different way, but this is for another discussion. In short, the MaXX<strong>desktop</strong> let you focus on the creative&nbsp; tasks ahead without interference or visual distractions.<em><strong>&nbsp; <br></strong></em></p>
<h3 id="bkmrk-experience-matter">Experience Matters</h3>
<p id="bkmrk-finally%2C-our-team-me">Our team is sharing the same vision of making use of the right set of technologies with industry proven best practices and guidelines to build the right software, the right way.&nbsp; We aim at providing a consistent and pleasant user experience built on top of modern and stable foundations.&nbsp; Every good and useful piece of tech deserves to be future-proof and this is where several decades of experience in building battle-proven mission critical systems for high performance Enterprise class applications comes in. If it's architect-ed properly,&nbsp; it can evolve without breaking apart!</p>
<h3 id="bkmrk-is-maxx-desktop-for-">Is MaXX Desktop for you?</h3>
<p id="bkmrk-maxx-desktop%27s-typic">MaXX<strong>desktop</strong>'s typical users are old IRIX users/sysadmins, Computer Graphics Artists, Motion Pictures and Special Effects Studios, Software/Game Developers, Visualization/Simulation, Virtual Reality power-users or Oil and Gas research to name a few. MaXX<strong>desktop</strong> is also for anyone who wants get a break from all the surrounding noises and create stuff while sporting a very unique/cool daily driver.<strong> If it is the case, then MaXX is for you.</strong></p>

<p dir="auto">A cross-platform lightweight single-header very simple-to-use window abstraction library for creating graphics Libraries or simple graphical programs. Written in pure C99.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">About</h2><a id="user-content-about" aria-label="Permalink: About" href="#about"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">RGFW is a free multi-platform single-header very simple-to-use window abstraction framework for creating graphics Libraries or simple graphical programs. it is meant to be used as a very small and flexible alternative library to GLFW.</p>
<p dir="auto">The window backend supports XLib (UNIX), Cocoas (MacOS), webASM (emscripten) and WinAPI (tested on windows <em>XP</em>, 10 and 11, and reactOS)<br>
Windows 95 &amp; 98 have also been tested with RGFW, although results are iffy</p>
<p dir="auto">Wayland: to compile wayland add (RGFW_WAYLAND=1). Wayland support is very experimental and broken.</p>
<p dir="auto">The graphics backend supports OpenGL (EGL, software, OSMesa, GLES), Vulkan, DirectX, <a href="https://github.com/RSGL/RGFW-Metal">Metal</a> and software rendering buffers.</p>
<p dir="auto">RGFW was designed as a backend for RSGL, but it can be used standalone or for other libraries, such as Raylib which uses it as an optional alternative backend.</p>
<p dir="auto">RGFW is multi-paradigm,<br>
By default RGFW uses a flexible event system, similar to that of SDL, however you can use callbacks if you prefer that method.</p>
<p dir="auto">This library</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>is single header and portable (written in C99 in mind)</li>
<li>is very small compared to other libraries</li>
<li>only depends on system API libraries, Winapi, X11, Cocoa</li>
<li>lets you create a window with a graphics context (OpenGL, Vulkan or DirectX) and manage the window and its events only with a few function calls</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">This library does not</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Handle any rendering for you (other than creating your graphics context)</li>
<li>do anything above the bare minimum in terms of functionality</li>
</ol>

	<div>
		<p>The complex of ideas I‚Äôm going to call the Dark Internet Forest emerges from mostly insidery tech thinking, but from multiple directions‚Äîinitially in Kickstarter co-founder Yancey Strickler‚Äôs <a href="https://www.ystrickler.com/the-dark-forest-theory-of-the-internet/" rel="noreferrer">freeform noticings</a> that apply science fiction writer Liu Cixin's dark forest theory of the universe to social media, then in humanist all-arounder Maggie Appleton‚Äôs <a href="https://maggieappleton.com/cozy-web" rel="noreferrer">illustrated tech notes</a>. It names an experience of paranoia and anxiety that by the end of the 2010s was widespread among people with meaningful connections between their online personas and their ability to maintain their standard of living. It hit a nerve, especially within some corners of tech-and-society thinking that influence internet makers. It even shows up in a <a href="https://www.nybooks.com/online/2024/05/04/more-real-than-life-i-saw-the-tv-glow/"><em>New York Review of Books</em> piece</a>: a coup for something so initially modest.</p><p>It‚Äôs tedious and a bit unfair to point out that an informal notion that escaped containment is flawed or incomplete, because of course it is. I‚Äôm going to do it anyway, because it describes a common set of experiences and reactions to our fraught moment in social technology. And also because analogies are tools to think with, and the tools we think with have weirdly intense shaping effects on what we do and make: <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/the-tragedy-of-the-commons-is-a-false-and-dangerous-myth" rel="noreferrer">see "the tragedy of the commons." </a></p><p><a href="https://www.ystrickler.com/the-dark-forest-theory-of-the-internet/">Strickler‚Äôs initial formulation</a>, published in 2019, translates a central idea from Liu‚Äôs <em>Three Body</em> series into a way of understanding the social internet. Liu‚Äôs dark forest theory resolves <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/fermi-paradox.html">the Fermi Paradox</a> (which is, roughly, "If the universe is so full of intelligent life, as statistics suggest it must be, where is everyone?") by explaining that all advanced galactic civilizations are locked into a bit of real-life game theory in which the annihilation of any other civilization they encounter is the only correct move. As Liu's characters discover, the universe is a dark forest filled with unstoppable monsters; the only viable strategy is to stay quiet and hide. </p><p>For Strickler, the internet was becoming just such a perilous dark forest, stalked by shadowy forces. Or, one sentence later, it was becoming a series of beneficial dark forests that provide refuge for the imperiled. These protective forests included newsletters and podcasts, but also, ‚ÄúSlack channels, private Instagrams, invite-only message boards, text groups, Snapchat, WeChat, and on and on.‚Äù</p><p>I found it difficult to focus on the initial post when it came out‚Äîsomething about its statement that before the 2016 US election, ‚Äúwe all lived in rounded filter bubbles of happiness,‚Äù only afterward learning that ‚Äúthe tools we thought were only life-giving could be weaponized as well,‚Äù kept making me gap out. But if you press on, there‚Äôs the idea that ‚Äúdark forest‚Äù internet spaces serve as refuges because they‚Äôre ‚Äúnon-indexed, non-optimized, and non-gamified.‚Äù And further, that dark forest spaces grow ‚Äúbecause they provide psychological and reputational cover. They allow us to be ourselves because we know who else is there.‚Äù </p><p>Now we're getting somewhere. This focus on places of reputational and psychological safety‚Äîwhich are safer both because of who‚Äôs ‚Äúthere‚Äù and because the shape of the space hasn‚Äôt been tuned for what I‚Äôd just call <em>extraction</em>‚Äîis an inside-out way of talking about <em>context collapse</em>. Context collapse‚Äîcommunication tuned for one socially distinct group but encountered by another, with uncomfortable and mind-bending and sometimes life-ruining results‚Äîemerges from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Presentation_of_Self_in_Everyday_Life" rel="noreferrer">Erving Goffman‚Äôs work in the 1950s</a>, as expanded by Joshua Meyrowitz in his <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/no-sense-of-place-9780195042313?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;" rel="noreferrer"><em>No Sense of Place</em></a> in the 1980s, and which danah boyd <a href="https://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2013/12/08/coining-context-collapse.html?utm_content=buffer5e438&amp;utm_source=buffer&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=Buffer" rel="noreferrer">began resuscitating and applying to the internet</a> in the early 2000s.</p><p>The longer I work in networked spaces, the more convinced I become that increasingly inescapable and seemingly innocuous forms of context collapse in our media and social internet systems secretly explain a shockingly large proportion of every weirding, every derangement, and every rollercoaster terror/joy of the systems we live in online. So no surprise, I think this part of the Dark Internet Forest complex is sharp and important. It also should make everyone working in tech flinch‚Äîbecause, of course, who built all those indexed, optimized, and gamified environments?</p><figure><img src="https://www.wrecka.ge/content/images/2024/11/who.jpg" alt="A screenshot from Untitled Goose Game in which the geese are yelling &quot;who built them&quot; and &quot;who built them motherfucker&quot; at the persecuted boy NPC." loading="lazy" width="1592" height="856" srcset="https://www.wrecka.ge/content/images/size/w600/2024/11/who.jpg 600w, https://www.wrecka.ge/content/images/size/w1000/2024/11/who.jpg 1000w, https://www.wrecka.ge/content/images/2024/11/who.jpg 1592w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p><a href="https://maggieappleton.com/cozy-web">Appleton‚Äôs follow-on post</a> synthesizes Strickler‚Äôs sense of both dangerous and useful dark forests with <a href="https://contraptions.venkateshrao.com/p/the-extended-internet-universe">Venkatesh Rao‚Äôs ‚Äúcozyweb‚Äù</a> and sketches an ecosystem that includes the perilous aboveground‚Äîthe ‚Äúdark forest of the clear web, inhabited by data scavengers, marketers, &amp; trolls‚Äù‚Äîand the cozyweb refuge underground. Appleton‚Äôs formulation is admirably clear:</p><blockquote>The predators here are the advertisers, tracking bots, clickbait creators, attention-hungry influencers, reply guys, and trolls. It's unsafe to reveal yourself to them in any authentic way. So we retreat into private spaces. We hide in the cozy web.</blockquote><p>Restructuring the analogy to make the dark forest represent the dangerous and compromised place, rather than the desired refuge, gives Appleton more to work with. The <a href="https://maggieappleton.com/ai-dark-forest">second of her Dark Forest posts is especially good</a>‚Äîit extends, without hype or theology, into the coming degradation of the public surfaces of the internet by antisocial actors wielding generative AI and the real paucity of ways to handle the damage those actors inflict, not only on the internet, but on our ability to believe that the people we meet there are real.</p><p>For my purposes, the Dark Internet Forest complex is one that uses the forest to contrast the feeling of a psychologically dangerous landscape with the one of spaces of retreat, and which‚Äîinescapably, because of its roots in Liu‚Äôs heavily philosophical fiction‚Äîpresents retreat as the only real option. Above all, it‚Äôs a series of descriptions of anxiety and of awakening to a sense of loss. Even for those of us spared the worst things the internet can do, this is a feeling most of us know‚Äîin 2019, I was almost entirely offline myself. Then <a href="https://erinkissane.com/xoxo" rel="noreferrer">2020 happened and rewired my sense of what we can and can't afford to surrender</a>, which is what keeps me circling around these ideas like a dazed shark.</p><p>As a description of personal anxieties and of a collective recoiling from extractive and predatory systems, I think the Dark Internet Forest is useful, because it gets us thinking about place. That‚Äôs maybe all it was ever meant to be, which is fine. I need something to one side of that, though‚Äîsomething that shares characteristics with thick description and frame analysis. And as a framing of the problems with our networks <em>for people in a position to do something about them</em>, the Dark Internet Forest pushes most of what I care about out of the picture. I want to bring them back.</p><h2 id="who-got-eaten">who got eaten</h2><p>The Dark Internet Forest focuses on harm to individual well-being and social status‚Äîto mental health, to reputation, to productivity. Those harms are real. And whether we‚Äôre talking about casual brigading or organized attempts to, for instance, prepare the ground for genocide, the platforms‚Äô extractive structures incentivize the loudest and most damaging behavior both directly and indirectly. But some products of mega-platforms of the social internet are much, much worse than others, and the first and second-order harms they create and incentivize have fallen hardest on those outside the sheltered sphere of US technology production.</p><p>First, whatever happens to social media users in the US, it‚Äôs much, much worse almost everywhere else. In 2017, Facebook‚Äôs <a href="https://erinkissane.com/meta-in-myanmar-full-series">years of active damage to the media landscape and startling neglect in the face of increasingly desperate warnings from experts</a> contributed‚Äö according to the United Nations, to <a href="https://erinkissane.com/meta-in-myanmar-part-ii-the-crisis">ethnic cleansing and genocide in Myanmar</a>. <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/07/29/1030260/facebook-whistleblower-sophie-zhang-global-political-manipulation/">Sophie Zhang‚Äôs whistleblower disclosures</a> reveal the extent of Meta‚Äôs longstanding failure to prevent its machinery from being <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/apr/12/facebook-fake-engagement-whistleblower-sophie-zhang">used with impunity to power covert influence campaigns and target journalists and opposition parties all over the world</a>‚Äî<em>except</em> in the US, Canada, and parts of Western Europe. Some of Frances Haugen‚Äôs disclosures touch on this exceptionalism as well: As of a few years ago, more than 90% of Facebook‚Äôs users live outside the US and Canada, but <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-drug-cartels-human-traffickers-response-is-weak-documents-11631812953">the company allocated that massive global userbase only 13% of its content moderation resources</a>.</p><p>Then there‚Äôs what was happening to women on social platforms closer to US tech workers' homes. In 2018, Amnesty International released a report <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/research/2018/03/online-violence-against-women-chapter-1-1/">summarizing the misogynist abuse women experienced on Twitter</a>; they followed up with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190203002740/https://decoders.amnesty.org/projects/troll-patrol/findings#inf_12">a crowd-powered data analysis</a> which found that women of color were 34% more likely to be sent abusive (and otherwise "problematic") messages than white women, and that Black women specifically were 84% more likely to be sent these messages. As a kicker, <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2024/06/united-states-social-media-companies-removal-of-abortion-related-content-may-hinder-access-to-accurate-health-information/">Amnesty recently released a report</a> on social media megaplatforms‚Äô removal of abortion-related content ‚Äúwith inadequate or unclear justification‚Äù after the overturning of Roe vs. Wade in the United States.</p><p>And despite objections from social media companies and some researchers stating that <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/08/youtube-rabbit-holes-american-politics/675186/">YouTube‚Äôs recommendation systems don‚Äôt encourage ‚Äúrabbit-hole‚Äù spirals</a>‚Äîor <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10468141/"><em>no longer</em> encourage them</a>, at least‚Äîa 2021 <em>Wall Street Journal</em> study finds <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-tiktok-inundates-teens-with-eating-disorder-videos-11639754848">TikTok‚Äôs algorithms serving young women content encouraging starvation</a>, a 2021 Media Matters study traces the way <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/tiktok/tiktoks-algorithm-leads-users-transphobic-videos-far-right-rabbit-holes">TikTok leads the viewers of anti-trans content into a cornucopia of extremist videos</a>, including ‚Äúmisogynistic content, racist and white supremacist content, anti-vaccine videos, antisemitic content, ableist narratives, conspiracy theories, hate symbols, and videos including general calls to violence‚Äù and a 2023 Amnesty study shows TikTok‚Äôs algorithms dropping proxies for young users into <a href="https://cdn.amnesty.at/media/11311/amnesty-report_driven_into_the_darkness_how-tiktoks-for-you-feed-encourages-self-harm-and-suicidal-ideation_november-2023.pdf">deep wells of suicidal-ideation content</a>. Studies like these absolutely get oversimplified into moral-panic‚Äìtinged political grandstanding, but the machinery is still out there, grinding away.</p><p>In a framework for thinking about our networks, to leave out the majority of people sustaining real damage is a failure of <em>perception</em> and of <em>proportion</em>. It matters because the remedies available to people like me‚Äîa white, tech-ish worker in the US‚Äîare not necessarily going to do much for the people bearing the brunt of the mega-platforms‚Äô worst actions.</p><p>And speaking of those actions‚Ä¶</p><h2 id="who-ate-them">who ate them</h2><p>On one hand, the predators in the Dark Internet Forest are the mega-platforms themselves, at the core of which are machines for turning human action and feeling into saleable data objects.</p><p>On the other hand, the predators are clearly <em>us</em>: Individual people doing galaxy-brain bad-faith readings of other people‚Äôs banal posts for the juice and swarms of people looking for ideological opponents to mob, largely as a way of claiming or defending quasi-spatial territory: <em>This is ours, not yours. We don‚Äôt do that here</em>. </p><p>There are also the industrialized battalions running variously sophisticated ops to make the ‚Äúpublic conversation‚Äù look like something it isn‚Äôt‚Äîto accelerate discord, to fake overwhelming support or opposition for an entity or idea, to make a group look stupid or <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/15/technology/myanmar-facebook-genocide.html?unlocked_article_code=KARVJapYvl1Y6L1cieWmNoOFxPgEAC2ZMHtfiZ7BsjuB4MSBfeTmmw8qAgf_LqJHnCEapaMqECHmO3q7kvvtYwii2910C_u_Kg-_EbNKEiyYglifgsfqSOQjuBB7jIpIGMYoG6yhsVeZ870Qc4PGIb0GNsypqYsMOY73_yzGrn79cFHQfEzvYPBJATppRHCHK-qy3gOmuLY0Tw_NmiDBDrF9veQ5xyjMCtfYXjNOJ1IbzxXuzCFUPMwscGe1WwM8-g_f-Byy-zbYVnSYx_wTJYPcCcrp7KppFt6NpxbBbVHLO0e-2gd2LKxotalTNVYGXiHq2mJYNaVhoDJaixTf6GADI3oUnA&amp;smid=url-share" rel="noreferrer">dangerous-and-therefore-worthy-of-extermination</a>, often <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/russian-black-activist-facebook-accounts/" rel="noreferrer">by pretending to be a member</a> and posting <a href="https://www.adl.org/disinformation-propaganda-advocating-violence-against-white-people-using-hashtags-associated-black" rel="noreferrer">stupid or dangerous things</a>. (I'm linking to old stories, but these campaigns have only revved up, globally, since then.)</p><p>If you believe that the shape of the mega-platforms has no bearing on these specific, internet-optimized antisocial behaviors‚Äîif you think that‚Äôs <em>just how people are</em>‚Äîthere‚Äôs genuinely not much to do about the PvP stuff. You can ban some fake accounts, build teams to look out for particularly successful covert influence campaigns, and give end-users rudimentary safety tools for when the mob turns on them, but beyond that, well. Can‚Äôt fix people problems with software. </p><p>If this truly is the case‚Äîif the only way to improve our public internet is to convert all humans one by one to a state of greater enlightenment‚Äîthen a full retreat into the bushes is the only reasonable course.</p><p>But it <strong>isn</strong>‚Äôt the case. Because yes, the existence of dipshits is indeed unfixable, but building arrays of Dipshit Accelerators that allow a small number of bad actors to build destructive empires defended by Dipshit Armies is a choice. The refusal to genuinely remodel that machinery when its harms first appear is another choice. Mega-platform executives, themselves frequently dipshits, who make these choices, lie about them to governments and ordinary people, and refuse to materially alter them. But in the Dark Internet Forest, the mega-platforms and their leaders are missing from the frame except as shadowy super-predators‚Äîthe equivalent of Liu‚Äôs inevitably annihilating aliens. </p><p>In truth, the mega-platforms and their pocket-warlord leaders fell into their roles largely by chance and have since attempted to rule as though extraordinarily consequential global rulemaking and governance by a handful of US companies built to exploit human feeling for financial gain were a sensible way to arrange the world. Facebook was born from a website made for elite students to rank their classmates‚Äô sexual attractiveness; Twitter was a watercooler where bored office workers could get attention by telling jokes in public. It‚Äôs as if 3M‚Äôs accidental invention of Post-It notes while failing to make space glue landed them a UN veto.</p><p>The dangers of the situation are obvious and real, but it matters that we remember that the world‚Äôs big platforms are steered not by shadowy forces, but by teams of gold-rush-addled dorks whose sometimes-well-meaning employees are stuck frantically LARPing world government on internal forum software. </p><p>It‚Äôs equally important to remember that the patterns we‚Äôve experienced on mega-platforms are not the only way to do networks but the result of specific combinations of under-thinking and malign commercial pressures‚Äîand that the currently ascendant systems are not inevitably annihilating forces, but legal and financial constructs that can be brought to heel, forcibly reconfigured, or just replaced. Keeping these basic facts in mind is oddly difficult, because there‚Äôs so much money involved, and money is a spell for blurring the truth.</p><p>But all these platforms and attendant dipshits <em>will</em> be replaced, eventually, and what happens next isn't guaranteed. The British East India company was a commercial atrocity factory at near-global scale; what came after it was direct colonial rule. The assumption that "Twitter but decentralized" or "Facebook but open-source and federated" will necessarily be good‚Äîrather than <em>differently bad</em>‚Äîis a weak one. </p><p>So the necessary counterpart to understanding that the Dark Forest Internet complex obscures the arbitrary and temporary nature of the current situation might be accepting that there is no moral arc of the world. Our systems bend toward justice when we bend them, and keep on bending them, forever.</p><p>I think our failure to remember that the mega-platforms are just intentionally extractive constructs run by brainmelted but very human weirdos is a failure of <em>accountability</em>, but our failure to remember that it doesn‚Äôt have to be this way is a failure not only of imagination, but of <em>nerve</em>.</p><h2 id="networking-as-if-people-mattered">networking as if people mattered</h2><p>The last and most most dangerous weakness of the Dark Internet Forest as a frame is that it positions the broad landscape of connection as something that ‚Äúwe‚Äù can simply do without‚Äîand without which we will indeed feel better and be more productive.</p><p>On the level of the individual, this is true for certain values of ‚Äúwe‚Äù: for people who are, in any sense, <em>established</em>; people who already have the social status they required to succeed in their field; people whose work doesn‚Äôt depend on them needing to find (and re-find and re-find) readers or customers; people whose professional and personal networks are already strong enough to catch them if they slip; people with money.</p><p>So what about everyone else? Should people without those forms of access and capital simply forgo all the benefits afforded by access to broad networks? Or, alternately, should we expect the new people, the young people, and the less-established people to just hack their way through that forest‚Äîwhich is so much gnarlier now than it was when we built it‚Äîto bootstrap their way to a nice bunker of their own? That rhymes, at least, with the patterns of generational disdain toward the people born into financial systems that strip away stabilities (affordable education, affordable housing, retirement funds, seasons with weather) their parents could take for granted, if they were white enough and within spitting range of middle class. The Avocado Toast Theory of the Internet, maybe.</p><p>This all stops being an individual problem and becomes a collective one when bad products of the social internet get worse, as when platform turmoil and manipulation helps remodel the offline world in the image of the most grotesque parts of the online one. And also when previously good products of the social internet are lost, as when it becomes impossible for people to find sustaining work, learn from one another, or organize responses to the rolling crises in which we live. </p><p>Given all of this, it seems questionable for technologists to cede the territory of the public internet to their <em>fellow-but-worse</em> technologists and the predatory forces they assemble and arm. This was always true, but maybe it's clearer now, as we watch the recreational troll armies and mega-platform leaders and openly supremacist policymakers and the next US presidential administration glop together like a bad special effect. But I would argue that socio-technical systems that invite and facilitate proto-fascist programs of universal surveillance, control, and dehumanization aren't safe in <em>any</em> hands.</p><p>The public social internet is worth designing and governing in a way that demonstrates less than total amnesia about the history of human civilizations and the ways we‚Äôve learned to be together without killing each other. For people with the ability and willingness to work on network problems, the real choice isn't between staying on the wasteland surfaces of the internet and going underground, but between making safer and better places for human sociability and not doing that.</p><p>Unfortunately, the business of building systems for civilization is as complicated and <em>as intrinsically political</em> online as it is offline. If retreat seems easier, that‚Äôs because it is. But here we are.</p><h2 id="what-is-a-forest-in-a-world-on-fire">what is a forest in a world on fire</h2><p>Shortly before he died in 2022, the great activist and writer Mike Davis said this to journalist Lois Beckett: ‚ÄúThere is so much unmobilized love out there. It‚Äôs really moving to see how much.‚Äù He was talking about the outpourings of gratitude from people whose lives he'd changed or set on better courses, after they learned he was dying. It's also a central truth of his life, and the way he worked in the world.</p><p><a href="https://www.haymarketbooks.org/books/791-hope-in-the-dark" rel="noreferrer">Rebecca Solnit has written movingly</a> about the freedom to care that arises during and after disaster, but living through it will rewire you for good. The arbitrary restrictions of normal life fall away. The need for broad connection becomes literally vital: people live or die based on the resources and help they receive or don‚Äôt receive. <a href="https://erinkissane.com/xoxo" rel="noreferrer">I said what I needed to say about that at XOXO</a>, but this explosive upwelling of care manifests in so many ways, starting with the mutual aid work that emerges overnight like mushrooms in the aftermath of ~natural disasters. But the mushrooms‚Äîthe fruiting bodies of vast subterranean networks‚Äîcan only pull off that magic trick because the hyphal infrastructure is already there, invisibly connected, waiting for the moment to emerge.</p><p>Collective action requires that we find each other, both beforehand and in the moment, and build human networks resilient enough to withstand every kind of weather. This becomes wickedly hard to do when the public social surfaces of the internet teem with predators‚Äîand also when they‚Äôre structured by root-level design decisions that make the simplest patterns of communication harder and worse in service of the systems‚Äô underlying anti-human purposes.</p><p>We make the human world by experimenting with ways to work together and then connecting those ways: villages and cities, hedge funds and labor unions, global conglomerates and volunteer rural fire departments, nation-states and communities of practice. We move between apartments and schools and sidewalks and shops and parks and airports and we understand, for the most part, who is there with us. Given the chance, we‚Äôd be moving freely between the surfaces and burrows of the internet, but many of those surfaces are on fire.</p><p>Back in the spring of this year, in an interview for the <a href="https://fediverse-governance.github.io/" rel="noreferrer">network governance project</a> I was working on, media and governance scholar Nathan Schneider‚Äîwhose <a href="https://www.ucpress.edu/books/governable-spaces/epub-pdf" rel="noreferrer">Governable Spaces</a> I am always recommending‚Äîsaid something that‚Äôs been ringing in my ears ever since:</p><blockquote>I think of tech as a wildfire‚Äîit burns really quickly. And we get a lot of wildfires out here, and there's the front of it, where the blaze is, and then once it's burnt over, that's when cool things start growing up. They grow much slower, and they find their way through‚Ä¶the burned trees and new life happens. I kind of hope we're entering that phase of social media that we're done with the fast burn. And maybe it had to happen.</blockquote><p>What‚Äôs there after the fire passes over if not that <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691220550/the-mushroom-at-the-end-of-the-world?srsltid=AfmBOoo6gvYwtVe6T7BbGX1RUsXTiclm0eDbLvZJ_ZKexsUNQ_iUrLiY" rel="noreferrer">goddamn mushroom at the end of a world</a>?</p><h2 id="forestry-for-beginners">forestry for beginners</h2><p>Here are some things I have come to believe.</p><p>Few, if any, of this moment‚Äôs apparently unstoppable tech platforms will survive for long. The people on them will eventually leave‚Äîwhen they‚Äôre forced to do so by the continuous degradation of their experience, or because they‚Äôre forced to do so because their governments put the hammer down, as Brazil recently demonstrated‚Äîor sometimes when they just get tired of platform leaders acting like clowns and boosting troll-agents of openly fascist chaos into power. And that there is therefore not only an opportunity to provide more humane places for those people to go, but a responsibility to do so. </p><p>Global mega-platforms under capitalism are <em>structurally incapable</em> of handling the business of civilization: of governance, of providing genuinely public infrastructure, of making knife-edge decisions about the balance of liberties and securities. It‚Äôs not what they do or what they <em>want</em> to do, and in many cases it‚Äôs in opposition to their actual interests. But even if they wanted to, even if they pulled off the trick of freeing themselves from the gravitational pull of capital and extraction, I don't think <em>any</em> centrally governed platform at global scale is capable of doing the work, even if they hired the best and sharpest people I know.* Even if they put real effort into humanist upstream product design, rather than tossing loose change to trust and safety teams sent in to clean up after the fact. </p><p>Local norms matter too much for global governance of the social internet to make sense; the flattening of global diversity to fit the norms and interests of any given American techno-culture‚Äîcorporate or otherwise‚Äîis both a baldly colonial aspiration and one we should scorn for the same reason that we leave the idea of effective, monolithic, planetary-scale government‚Äîbenevolent or otherwise‚Äîto underbaked science fiction. Home rule and genuine resilience both require the existence of <em>many places</em>, many of them at least partially interconnected. Decades down the road, I think the notion that a pack of mostly-American mega-corporations could ever have stood in for the complexities of governing a new layer of global public life, with all the opportunities and dangers it brings, will be obviously laughable. I think it already is.</p><p>And most of all: The social internet <em>should</em> be a forest‚Äînot The Dark Forest, but something much more like a real one: Interconnected from the densely mycelial underground to light-filtering overstory but <em>also</em> offering infinite niches and multi-scale zones of sheltered exchange and play. Deeply human in the way that real forests are the  result of human and other-than-human collaboration running back into unrecorded time. Balanced, neither extracting too much from its component organisms nor pretending that a pantomime of a return to a pristine and ungoverned state will solve any problems at all. (Predation is inevitable in any system, but a working ecosystem starves out the ones who overfeed and provides cover for growth and for the long, continuous experiment of evolutionary change.)</p><p>The obstacles to these life-sustaining internet forests are fundamentally the same forces that threaten the real forests and our whole living world: unbounded extraction; unaccountable leadership; societal refusal to take on the responsibilities of governing our increasingly complex commons, instead of burying them deeper and deeper in pretenses to action. </p><p> I no longer think that it's possible to mount an effective defense of the physical world‚Äîand of each other, in our fleshy vulnerability‚Äîwithout unfucking our networks. I find this both terrifying and clarifying. </p><h2 id="the-burrow-and-the-upper-world">the burrow and the upper world</h2><p>In the introduction of his <em>Cosmos &amp; Hearth</em>, the wonderful humanist geographer Yi-Fu Tuan briefly refers to a passage about Mole‚Äôs homecoming in <em>The Wind in the Willows</em>. In that scene, Mole, who has been adventuring broadly with Rat and company, gazes around his home before sleeping:</p><blockquote>He saw clearly how plain and simple‚Äîhow narrow, even‚Äîit all was; but clearly, too, how much it all meant to him, and the special value of some such anchorage in one's existence. He did not at all want to abandon the new life and its splendid spaces, to turn his back on sun and air and all they offered him and creep home and stay there; the upper world was all too strong, it called to him still, even down there, and he&nbsp;knew he must return to the larger stage. But it was good to think he had this to come back to, this place which was all his own‚Ä¶</blockquote><p>Mole‚Äôs contentment at this point, midway through the novel, is quite different from his state at its beginning, which finds him spring-cleaning his cozy, dozy network of tunnels, but struck with a sudden longing for something more. By the middle of the novel, Mole‚Äôs experience has opened out to encompass the whole of the wood and countryside and his friendships with Rat, Badger, and the born poster, Mr. Toad, along with his encounters with the book‚Äôs few real villains and dangers.</p><p>As he slides into sleep, Mole‚Äôs beloved Rat is already snoozing across the burrow; his friendship is by far the greatest gift of the world beyond Mole‚Äôs comfortable tunnels. In the morning, they will venture out together.</p><h2 id="notes">notes</h2><p>(*) I'd love to be wrong about this, and I have a list of those best and sharpest people you can hire if you're serious‚Äîyou know where to find me.</p><p>I keep coming back to Ucello's <em>Hunt in the Forest</em> because it's such a great, creepy painting‚Äîthe streamlined deer and hounds, especially, echoing each other so closely it's hard to tell them apart. Most all the human faces are transfixed, staring, shouting or blowing the hunting horn. It's so loud in that moment, but the painting is, of course, perfectly still. The hunt goes back forever. (That horse in the right foreground is about to fuck someone up.)<strong> </strong>I saw it at the Ashmolean once and I don't know if I will ever get to see it again.</p><p>There's another essay applying Dark Forest theory to the internet that I only encountered much later‚Äî<a href="https://flugschriften.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/flugschriften-6-bogna-konior-the-dark-forest-theory-of-the-internet-v.2.pdf" rel="noreferrer">Bogna Konior's 2020 essay</a> (<a href="https://blokmagazine.com/the-dark-forest-theory-of-the-internet/" rel="noreferrer">alt version in HTML but without the accompanying photos</a>) was commissioned for an exhibition in Slovenia. Konior‚Äôs piece engages with Liu's work before leaping into the <a href="https://exmilitai.re/flatline-constructs.pdf" rel="noreferrer">void-flavored Mark Fisher zone</a>. In its language and logic, Konior‚Äôs piece works in a Cronenberg-tinged mode of <a href="https://thepointmag.com/criticism/when-nothing-is-cool/">academic cool</a>‚Äîedgy, a little squelchy, heavy on longing and sensation, but only at a distance and within the frame of inevitability. It was still fun to read. Konior doesn't acknowledge prior adaptations of Liu‚Äôs theories to the internet; as far as I can tell, the tech scene has ignored her back. </p><h2 id="thank-you">thank you</h2><p>Huge thanks to the people who've signed up to <a href="https://www.wrecka.ge/on-memberships/" rel="noreferrer">support this site and my work</a>.
