          <p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2023/09/the-spectacular-downfall-of-a-common-useless-cold-medicine/">In a long-sought move</a>, the Food and Drug Administration on Thursday formally began the process of abandoning oral doses of a common over-the-counter decongestant, which the agency concluded last year is not effective at relieving stuffy noses.</p>
<p>Specifically, the FDA issued <a href="https://dps.fda.gov/omuf/ordersearch/order_otc000036">a proposed order</a> to remove oral phenylephrine from the list of drugs that drugmakers can include in over-the-counter products—also known as the OTC monograph. Once removed, drug makers will no longer be able to include phenylephrine in products for the temporary relief nasal congestion.</p>
<p>"It is the FDA’s role to ensure that drugs are safe and effective," Patrizia Cavazzoni, director of the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said in a statement. "Based on our review of available data and consistent with the advice of the advisory committee, we are taking this next step in the process to propose removing oral phenylephrine because it is not effective as a nasal decongestant."</p>
<p>For now, the order is just a proposal. The FDA will open up a public comment period, and if no comments can sway the FDA's previous conclusion that the drug is useless, the agency will make the order final. Drugmakers will get a grace period to reformulate their products.</p>
<h2>Reviewed reviews</h2>
<p>The slow-moving abandonment of phenylephrine is years in the making. The decongestant was originally approved by the FDA back in 1976, but it came to prominence after 2006. That was the year when the "Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act of 2005" came into effect, and pseudoephedrine—the main component of Sudafed—moved behind the pharmacy counter to keep it from being used to make methamphetamine. With pseudoephedrine out of easy reach at drugstores, phenylephrine became the leading over-the-counter decongestant. And researchers had questions.</p>
<p>In 2007, an FDA panel reevaluated the drug, which allegedly works by shrinking blood vessels in the nasal passage, opening up the airway. While the panel upheld the drug's approval, it concluded that more studies were needed for a full assessment. After that, three large, carefully designed studies were conducted—two by Merck for the treatment of seasonal allergies and one by Johnson &amp; Johnson for the treatment of the common cold. All three found no significant difference between phenylephrine and a placebo.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><blockquote><p>I am currently writing a analysis tool for Sql: <a href="https://github.com/xnacly/sqleibniz"><code>sqleibniz</code></a>, specifically for the sqlite
dialect.</p><p>The goal is to perform static analysis for sql input, including: syntax
checks, checks if tables, columns and functions exist. Combining this with an
embedded sqlite runtime and the ability to assert conditions in this runtime,
creates a really great dev experience for sql.</p><p>Furthermore, I want to be able to show the user high quality error messages
with context, explainations and the ability to mute certain diagnostics.</p><p>This analysis includes the stages of lexical analysis/tokenisation, the
parsing of SQL according to the sqlite documentation<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> and
the analysis of the resulting constructs.</p><p>After completing the static analysis part of the project, I plan on writing a
lsp server for sql, so stay tuned for that.</p></blockquote><p>In the process of the above, I need to write a tokenizer and a parser - both
for SQL. While I am nowhere near completion of sqleibniz, I still made some
discoveries around rust and the handy features the language provides for
developing said software.</p><h2 id="macros">Macros</h2><p>Macros work different in most languages. However they are used for mostly the
same reasons: code deduplication and less repetition.</p><h3 id="abstract-syntax-tree-nodes">Abstract Syntax Tree Nodes</h3><p>A node for a statement in <code>sqleibniz</code> implementation is defined as follows:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span>1</span><span>

</span></span><span><span>6</span><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Furthermore all nodes are required to implement the <code>Node</code>-trait, this trait
is returned by all parser functions and is later used to analyse the contents
of a statement:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span>1</span><span><span>pub</span> <span>trait</span> Node: <span>std</span>::fmt::Debug {

except the <code>Token</code> field <code>t</code>, the second node requires a child field with a
type.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span> 1</span><span><span>#[derive(Debug)]</span>

postfix it with its repetition. We use <code>:</code> to delimit inside the metavariable

string we want to generate for our node - we now use the <code>#[doc = ...]</code>
annotation instead of the commonly known <code>/// ...</code> syntax to pass our macro

tests check wheter the parser correctly asserts the conditions the sql standard
lays out, see <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/syntax/sql-stmt.html">sqlite - sql-stmt</a>.
Specifically, either that a statement follows after the <code>EXPLAIN</code> identifier or
the <code>QUERY PLAN</code> and a statement follow.</p><p>The difference between these tests and the tests for the lexer are in the way
the assertions are made. Take a look at the code the macros produce:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span> 1</span><span><span>#[cfg(test)]</span>

<p>Let’s start with the basics:</p>



<ul>
<li>WSPR stands for Weak Signal Propagation Reporter—a protocol implemented in a computer program used for weak-signal radio communication between hams.</li>



<li>It lets users send and receive low-power transmissions for testing MF and HF propagation paths.</li>



<li>Pronounced “whisper,” WSPR was designed and written initially by Nobel Prize winner and <strong><a href="https://www.onallbands.com/category/technical-articles/ft8/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FT8</a></strong> creator Joe Taylor, K1JT.</li>



<li>The software code is now open source and updated by a small team.</li>
</ul>



<p>If you’ve wondered if a band is open, WSPR can tell you.</p>



<figure><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="538" height="353" src="https://www.onallbands.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/wspr-radio-display-screengrab.jpg" alt="wspr radio propagation display map" srcset="https://www.onallbands.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/wspr-radio-display-screengrab.jpg 538w, https://www.onallbands.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/wspr-radio-display-screengrab-300x197.jpg 300w, https://www.onallbands.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/wspr-radio-display-screengrab-310x203.jpg 310w" sizes="(max-width: 538px) 100vw, 538px"><figcaption>(Image/Elizabeth Klinc, KE8FMJ)</figcaption></figure>



<p>As noted by Joe Taylor, K1JT, and Bruce Walker, W1BW, in their November 2010 <em>QST</em> article, “<strong><a href="https://www.arrl.org/files/file/History/History%20of%20QST%20Volume%201%20-%20Technology/QS11-2010-Taylor.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WSPRing Around the World</a></strong>,” WSPR transmits and receives but does not support normal types of on-the-air conversation. It sends and receives specially coded, beacon-like transmissions which establish whether particular propagation paths are open. Transmissions convey a callsign, station location, and power level using a compressed data format with strong forward error correction (FEC) and narrow-band, four-tone frequency-shift-keying (FSK).</p>



<p>K1JT notes that FEC greatly improves chances of copy and reduces errors to an extremely low rate. The signal bandwidth is only 6 Hz. Combined with randomized time-sharing, this assures that dozens of WSPR signals can fit into a 200 Hz segment of each amateur band. The WSPR protocol is effective at signal-to-noise ratios as low as -28 dB in a 2500 Hz bandwidth, about 10 to 15 dB below the threshold of audibility. On most bands, typical WSPR power levels are 5W or less (sometimes significantly less).</p>



<p>As the protocol has evolved, enhancements to WSPR have included upgrades in its decoder’s sensitivity, improved ability to handle larger numbers of signals in crowded sub-bands, and better detection of false decodes.</p>



<p>To take advantage of WSPR on the amateur bands, you’ll need a radio (one with USB audio is preferred) and a computer with an Internet connection. As users have pointed out online, you don’t need to transmit. Your system can still report what it hears.</p>



<p>The standard message is &lt;callsign&gt; + &lt;4 character locator&gt; + &lt;dBm transmit power&gt;. For example, “KE8FMJ EM89 37” is a signal from station KE8FMJ in Maidenhead grid cell “EM89,” sending 37 dBm, or about 5.0W.</p>

<p>The Republican who is likely to lead the Federal Communications Commission under President-elect Donald Trump detailed how he would run the agency when he wrote a chapter for the conservative Heritage Foundation's Project 2025. Carr, a longtime opponent of net neutrality rules and other broadband regulations, has also made his views clear numerous times when opposing rulemakings initiated by the current Democratic majority.</p>
<p>If Trump makes Carr the next FCC chairman after his inauguration, the FCC is likely to ditch consumer protection initiatives, like a recently announced inquiry into data caps, and attempt to regulate Big Tech companies while reducing regulation of Internet service providers. That could include forcing Big Tech companies to pay into a fund that subsidizes ISPs' broadband network construction.</p>
<p>A Carr-led FCC could also try to punish news organizations that are perceived to be anti-Trump. Just before the election, Carr <a href="https://x.com/BrendanCarrFCC/status/1852887210330341693">alleged</a> that NBC putting Kamala Harris on <em>Saturday Night Live</em> was "a clear and blatant effort to evade the FCC's Equal Time rule," and that the FCC should <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fcc-commissioner-rips-nbc-over-harris-last-minute-snl-appearance-plainly-designed-evade-rules">consider issuing penalties</a>. Despite Carr's claim, NBC did provide equal time to the Trump campaign.</p>
<p>Carr might also try to steer money to Elon Musk's Starlink system. Carr was a vocal opponent of the FCC decision to deny SpaceX's application for $886 million in government funding and <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/FCC-23-105A1.pdf">claimed</a> that "President Biden gave federal agencies a greenlight" to punish Musk after he bought Twitter.</p>
<h2>FCC chair’s power</h2>
<p>Carr became an FCC commissioner in August 2017 after being nominated by then-President Trump. Carr was previously a legal adviser to Commissioner Ajit Pai and was briefly the FCC's general counsel during Pai's first year as chair in 2017.</p>
<p>Carr's <a href="https://static.project2025.org/2025_MandateForLeadership_CHAPTER-28.pdf">Project 2025 chapter</a>, published in 2023, said "the FCC's Chairperson serves as the agency's CEO and is empowered with significant authority that is not shared with other Commissioners." The chair "sets the FCC's agenda, decides what matters the agency will vote on and when, and has authority to organize and coordinate the FCC's work," Carr wrote. Although the president's nominations for each commissioner require Senate approval, the president can appoint any sitting commissioner to the chair spot without a Senate vote.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>The chair does not have unlimited power, of course. Congress can expand or reduce the FCC's authority by passing new laws or eliminating existing ones. FCC decisions are routinely challenged in court, and a recent <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/06/scotus-kills-chevron-deference-giving-courts-more-power-to-block-federal-rules">Supreme Court ruling</a> limited the regulatory authority of federal agencies.</p>
<p>Carr wants the FCC to regulate less, at least when it comes to Internet service providers. "The FCC is a New Deal–era agency. Its history of regulation tends to reflect the view that the federal government should impose heavy-handed regulation rather than relying on competition and market forces to produce optimal outcomes," he wrote.</p>
<p>The FCC, he said, "should engage in a serious top-to-bottom review of its regulations and take steps to rescind any that are overly cumbersome or outdated," and "focus its efforts on creating a market-friendly regulatory environment that fosters innovation and competition from a wide range of actors, including cable-based, broadband-based, and satellite-based Internet providers."</p>
<p>Chris Lewis, president and CEO of consumer advocacy group Public Knowledge, told Ars that Carr appears to be a leading candidate for the chairmanship "because of his experience and active presence in trying to chart a course for Republicans on telecom policy," with the Project 2025 chapter being a prime example.</p>
<p>Public Knowledge generally argues that the FCC should take a bigger role in regulating Internet providers. "The public expects that there is an agency protecting consumers over communications networks and I think it would be wise for the new majorities and new administration to be clearheaded about that," Lewis said.</p>
<h2>Carr targets Big Tech and online speech</h2>
<p>The FCC should have four primary goals, Carr wrote. Those goals are "reining in Big Tech, promoting national security, unleashing economic prosperity, and ensuring FCC accountability and good governance."</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>On Big Tech, Carr wants to implement Trump's 2020 plan to crack down on social media websites for alleged anti-conservative bias. At the time, Trump <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/07/trumps-social-media-crackdown-called-a-monumental-waste-of-fccs-time/">formally petitioned the FCC</a> to reinterpret Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act in a way that would limit social media platforms' legal protections for hosting third-party content when the platforms take down content they consider objectionable.</p>
<p>Trump was so keen on getting this done in 2020 that he <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/08/trump-pulls-re-nomination-of-fcc-republican-who-stood-up-for-first-amendment/">withdrew his re-nomination</a> of then-Commissioner Michael O'Rielly, a Republican who took the party line on most issues but did not support Trump's attempt to punish social networks. Trump and the Senate <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/09/trump-replaces-fcc-member-in-bid-to-push-through-twitter-facebook-crackdown/">replaced O'Rielly with Nathan Simington</a>, who was a member of the Trump administration before <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/12/senate-confirms-trump-fcc-nominee-cementing-2-2-deadlock-for-biden-admin/">becoming an FCC commissioner</a> just before Trump's first term ended. Simington is another possible chairman and has similar views as Carr, but Carr has a longer tenure on the FCC and has sought the media spotlight more than Simington.</p>
<p>In the Project 2025 publication, Carr's "reining in Big Tech" section said the FCC "should issue an order that interprets Section 230 in a way that eliminates the expansive, non-textual immunities that courts have read into the statute."</p>
<p>"The FCC has an important role to play in addressing the threats to individual liberty posed by corporations that are abusing dominant positions in the market. Nowhere is that clearer than when it comes to Big Tech and its attempts to drive diverse political viewpoints from the digital town square," Carr wrote.</p>

<h2>First Amendment</h2>
<p>Lewis said Public Knowledge is worried that changes to Section 230 would harm the ability of online platforms to moderate content or choose not to moderate content, because companies could face great legal liability for those choices if 230 is weakened or scrapped.</p>
<p>O'Rielly argued in a July 2020 <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-365814A1.pdf">speech</a> that apparently angered Trump that the FCC shouldn't regulate in this area. "The First Amendment protects us from limits on speech imposed by the government—not private actors—and we should all reject demands, in the name of the First Amendment, for private actors to curate or publish speech in a certain way," O'Rielly said at the time. "Like it or not, the First Amendment's protections apply to corporate entities, especially when they engage in editorial decision making."</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Carr claimed in his Project 2025 chapter that "the FCC has authority to take this action because Section 230 is codified in the Communications Act," and he pointed to Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas' <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/04/clarence-thomas-blasts-section-230-wants-common-carrier-rules-on-twitter/">views on the law</a> as evidence that the FCC can act.</p>
<p>Carr's chapter also said the FCC should "address TikTok's threat to US national security," saying the Chinese-owned social network "provides Beijing with an opportunity to run a foreign influence campaign by determining the news and information that the app feeds to millions of Americans."</p>
<h2>Carr’s Kamala Harris complaint</h2>
<p>On November 2, Carr claimed that NBC was trying to evade the Equal Time rule by putting Democratic nominee Kamala Harris on <em>Saturday Night Live</em>. "The purpose of the rule is to avoid exactly this type of biased and partisan conduct—a licensed broadcaster using the public airwaves to exert its influence for one candidate on the eve of an election. Unless the broadcaster offered Equal Time to other qualifying campaigns," Carr wrote.</p>
<p>Carr later <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fcc-commissioner-rips-nbc-over-harris-last-minute-snl-appearance-plainly-designed-evade-rules">told Fox News</a> that "all remedies should be on the table," including "license revocations."</p>
<p>"One commissioner standing alone, there's no real consequence that I can impose at this point," he said. "You need the FCC chairperson or at least three commissioners on the FCC to agree to take action. We'll see if we end up there with this commission or otherwise."</p>
<p>Carr was wrong about the Equal Time rule, <a href="https://www.freepress.net/news/press-releases/fccs-carr-wrongly-claims-snl-appearance-violates-agencys-equal-time-rules">media advocacy group Free Press said</a> on November 3. The group pointed to an <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/sites/default/files/political_programming_fact_sheet.pdf">FCC fact sheet</a> that says the rule "does not require a station to provide opposing candidates with programs identical to the initiating candidate."</p>
<p>"Despite Carr's claim, there is no evidence that the network was trying to avoid the rules," Free Press said. "Broadcasters have no legal obligation to set aside broadcast time for opposing candidates, unless the candidates request it. Equal-opportunity requests are commonplace in the final days of a national election, and broadcasters typically honor them."</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>NBC did <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2024-11-04/trump-campaign-gets-equal-time-from-nbc-after-harris-snl-appearance">honor a request</a> for equal time from the Trump campaign, giving him two free 60-second messages during NASCAR and NFL coverage.</p>
<h2>“Carr is desperate to become the FCC chair”</h2>
<p>Free Press co-CEO Jessica González said, "It's bizarre that a sitting FCC commissioner would engage in such a blatant and wrongheaded attempt to curry favor with a presidential candidate. But this is just the sort of reckless behavior we've come to expect from Brendan Carr. You'd expect an FCC commissioner to be familiar with his own agency's regulations. Instead Carr seems willing to concoct falsehoods if it means he'll get noticed by the former president."</p>
<p>González added, "It's no secret around Washington that Carr is desperate to become the FCC chair should Trump be elected president. First Carr wrote a chapter in the widely discredited policy platform for Project 2025, a far-right master plan to disassemble US democracy. Now he's making grossly inaccurate claims about communications law to win points with the former president."</p>
<p>Carr continued claiming that NBC violated the rule even after Trump was given free TV time. "NBC and SNL decided to bring just one candidate on less than 50 hours before Election Day," he <a href="https://x.com/BrendanCarrFCC/status/1854223937271398787">wrote on November 6</a>. "The FCC has previously addressed these types of 'last minute' situations. I encourage any candidate that does not believe that their Equal Time rights were honored to bring the issue forward to the FCC for our adjudication."</p>

<h2>Making Big Tech pay</h2>
<p>Carr wants to help Internet service providers achieve a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/06/isps-ask-fcc-for-tax-on-big-tech-to-fund-broadband-networks-and-discounts/">long-held dream</a> of making tech companies pay for broadband network upgrades. Carr's Project 2025 chapter said the FCC should "require that Big Tech begin to contribute a fair share" into "the FCC's roughly $9 billion Universal Service Fund."</p>

<p>The fund has long been paid for by telecom companies, which generally pass the cost on to consumers on their telephone bills. "While Big Tech derives tremendous value from the federal government's universal service investments—using those federally supported networks to deliver their products and realize significant profits—these large corporations have avoided paying a fair share into the program," Carr wrote.</p>
<p>The Biden administration <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/05/biden-admin-wants-europe-to-reject-forced-payments-from-big-tech-to-isps/">urged Europe</a> to reject a similar idea last year, saying that payments from online platforms to ISPs would "distort competition" and undermine net neutrality. The European plan was also criticized by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/03/meta-slams-telco-fee-proposal-says-isps-should-pay-their-own-network-costs/">Meta</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/09/google-fights-latest-attempt-to-have-big-tech-pay-for-isps-network-upgrades/">Google</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/03/netflix-fights-attempt-to-make-streaming-firms-pay-for-isp-network-upgrades/">Netflix</a>, and the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (BEREC). The group of regulators from European countries <a href="https://www.berec.europa.eu/system/files/2023-05/BoR%20(23)%20131b%20Overview%20of%20BEREC%20Response%20to%20Exploratory%20Consultation.pdf">said</a> it found no evidence of "free-riding" by tech companies or evidence that ISPs' costs weren't fully covered.</p>
<p>If he becomes chair, Carr would have significant influence over which companies get money from the Universal Service Fund. Carr was angry about the FCC decision to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/08/fcc-rejects-starlinks-886-million-grant-says-spacex-proposal-too-risky/">reject Starlink's application</a> to receive $885.51 million in broadband funding.</p>
<p>The grant was tentatively awarded during Pai's tenure but canceled in a 2022 ruling that called Starlink a "nascent LEO [low Earth orbit] satellite technology" with "recognized capacity constraints." The Biden-era FCC had earlier pointed out that Pai's system for choosing grant winners led to "complaints that the program was poised to fund broadband to parking lots and well-served urban areas."</p>
<p>When the FCC <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/12/spacex-blasts-fcc-as-it-refuses-to-reinstate-starlinks-886-million-grant/">rejected Starlink's appeal</a> in 2023, Carr said the FCC decision "certainly fits the Biden Administration's pattern of regulatory harassment."&nbsp;The FCC, Carr said, is one of a "growing list of administrative agencies that are taking action against Elon Musk's businesses." He alleged that "the Biden Administration is choosing to prioritize its political and ideological goals at the expense of connecting Americans."</p>

<h2>Killing broadband regulation</h2>
<p>Carr also wants to help ISPs avoid regulation. A Carr-led FCC would likely drop the agency's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/10/is-net-neutrality-doomed-at-supreme-court-fcc-and-isps-prepare-for-epic-battle/">legal defense of its net neutrality rules</a>, and that defense is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/08/fcc-suffers-major-setback-in-attempt-to-defend-net-neutrality-rules/">off to a rocky start</a> in court already.</p>
<p>California and other states have been <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/04/fcc-wont-block-california-net-neutrality-law-says-states-can-experiment/">regulating net neutrality</a> themselves since the Pai FCC eliminated Obama-Era rules that prohibited paid prioritization and blocking or throttling of lawful traffic. The next FCC chair could try to revive Pai's attempt to preempt state laws, which was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/10/why-ajit-pais-unhinged-net-neutrality-repeal-was-upheld-by-judges/">rejected in court</a> in 2019.</p>
<p>Carr would likely try to halt or unwind other initiatives that Democratic Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel has undertaken to help broadband consumers. Carr dissented last year in the FCC's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/11/cable-lobby-and-ted-cruz-are-disappointed-as-fcc-bans-digital-discrimination/">3-2 decision to impose rules</a> that prohibit discrimination in access to broadband services. Carr described Rosenworcel's discrimination proposal as "President Biden's plan to give the administrative state effective control of all Internet services and infrastructure in the US," claiming it was "motivated by an ideology of government control that is not compatible with the fundamental precepts of free market capitalism."</p>
<p>Rosenworcel last month <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/fcc-republican-opposes-regulation-of-data-caps-with-analogy-to-coffee-refills/">announced a formal inquiry into data caps</a> to consider their effect on consumers and whether the FCC has authority to regulate them.&nbsp;In dissent, Carr <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/FCC-24-106A3.pdf">said</a>, "I cannot support the Biden-Harris Administration's inexorable march towards rate regulation," and that "the FCC plainly does not have the legal authority" to regulate data caps.</p>
<p>He also said that data caps can be good for Internet users. "Prohibiting customers from choosing to purchase plans with data caps—which are more affordable than unlimited ones—necessarily regulates the service rates they are paying for," Carr said.</p>
<p>Lewis told Ars that ditching the data cap inquiry means that "we will miss out on opportunities to look at when a broadband provider preferences its own streaming service or other service over a competitor's. Ending the data caps probe will mean we will not be able to look at those sorts of specific cases and see if there is an anticompetitive practice."</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
		
			<p>New research suggests that adding a small amount of physical activity – such as uphill walking or stair-climbing – into your day may help to lower blood pressure.</p>
<p>The study, published in Circulation, was carried out by experts from the <a href="https://www.propassconsortium.org/">ProPASS (Prospective Physical Activity, Sitting and Sleep) Consortium</a>, an international academic collaboration led by the University of Sydney and <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/">University College London</a> (UCL).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just five minutes of activity a day was estimated to potentially reduce blood pressure, while replacing sedentary behaviours with 20-27 minutes of exercise per day, including uphill walking, stair-climbing, running and cycling, was also estimated to lead to a clinically meaningful reduction in blood pressure.</p>
<p>Joint senior author <a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/medicine-health/about/our-people/academic-staff/emmanuel-stamatakis.html">Professor Emmanuel Stamatakis,</a> Director of the ProPASS Consortium from the <a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/charles-perkins-centre/">Charles Perkins Centre</a> said: “High blood pressure is one of the biggest health issues globally, but unlike some major causes of cardiovascular mortality there may be relatively accessible ways to tackle the problem in addition to medication.”</p>
<p>“The finding that doing as little as five extra minutes of exercise per day could be associated with measurably lower blood pressure readings emphasises how powerful short bouts of higher intensity movement could be for blood pressure management.”</p>
<p>Hypertension, or a consistent elevated blood pressure level, is one of the biggest causes of premature death globally. Affecting 1.28 billion adults around the world, it can lead to stroke, heart attack, heart failure, kidney damage and many other health problems, and is often described as the ‘silent killer’ due to its lack of symptoms.</p>
<p>The research team analysed health data from 14,761 volunteers in five countries to see how replacing one type of movement behaviour with another across the day is associated with blood pressure.</p>
<p>Each participant used a wearable accelerometer device on their thigh to measure their activity and blood pressure throughout the day and night.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Daily activity was split into six categories: sleep, sedentary behaviour (such as sitting), slow walking, fast walking, standing, and more vigorous exercise such as running, cycling or stair climbing.</p>
<p>The team modelled statistically what would happen if an individual changed various amounts of one behaviour for another in order to estimate the effect on blood pressure for each scenario and found that replacing sedentary behaviour with 20-27 minutes of exercise per day could potentially reduce cardiovascular disease by up to 28 percent at a population level.</p>
<p>First author <a href="https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/58333-jo-blodgett">Dr Jo Blodgett</a> from the <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/surgery/">Division of Surgery and Interventional Science</a> at UCL and the <a href="https://www.iseh.co.uk/">Institute of Sport, Exercise and Health</a> said: “Our findings suggest that, for most people, exercise is key to reducing blood pressure, rather than less strenuous forms of movement such as walking.</p>
<p>“The good news is that whatever your physical ability, it doesn’t take long to have a positive effect on blood pressure. What’s unique about our exercise variable is that it includes all exercise-like activities, from running for a bus or a short cycling errand, many of which can be integrated into daily routines.</p>
<p>“For those who don’t do a lot of exercise, walking did still have some positive benefits for blood pressure. But if you want to change your blood pressure, putting more demand on the cardiovascular system through exercise will have the greatest effect.”</p>
<p>Professor Mark Hamer, joint senior author of the study and ProPASS Deputy Director from UCL, said: “Our findings show how powerful research platforms like the ProPASS consortium are for identifying relatively subtle patterns of exercise, sleep, and sedentary behaviour, that have&nbsp; significant clinical and public health importance.”</p>

Standard size here is 3/8 inch which is the outer diameter of the tubing. They are easy to work with as you only need a tube cutter (or hacksaw with fine tooth pitch) and a wrench. You cut the tube, slide a compression nut over, slide the ferrule(s) on, insert the tube into the fitting, finger tighten the compression nut, make sure everything is aligned then tighten nut with wrench. No solder, no fancy crimp tools. You can disassemble and reassemble without leaks. The only issue is the ferrule winds up becoming swaged to the tube after wrench tightening so you have to cut the tube end off behind the ferrule if you want to replace the nut.</p><p>However, instead of using rigid metal or plastic tubing you commonly find a flexible hose assembly[1]. Only fancy installs use custom formed polished rigid tube for the look. We also tend to leave most of the plumbing in the walls and only the shut off valve protrudes from the wall. Maybe there are flexible hoses available in your region.</p><p>When I installed my bidet all I needed was a 3/8 compression tee[2] which they make specifically to tap shutoff valves. The bidet came with a 3/8 connection hose so that went to the tee and I was up and running. The big issue was electric - no outlets in the bathroom. So having seen how Japan loves extension cords I too used one, ran a 12 AWG cord out to the hall to a GFI adapter plugged into a socket. Jank but highly unlikely to cause a fire.</p><p>[1] <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/b/Plumbing-Plumbing-Parts-Supply-Lines/Toilet-Connector/N-5yc1vZbqjnZ1z138l5" rel="nofollow">https://www.homedepot.com/b/Plumbing-Plumbing-Parts-Supply-L...</a></p><p>[2] <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Breezliy-Lead-Free-Compression-Outlet-Connect/dp/B0BDLBZ9P6/" rel="nofollow">https://www.amazon.com/Breezliy-Lead-Free-Compression-Outlet...</a></p></div></td></tr>

                  <p>I got a (non-cargo) e-bike for close to USD1000. Definitely a game changer - faster and more reliable than trains or driving to get to work. Any trip with 5km just becomes a no-friction option, where otherwise it might be tempting to get into the car. An e-bike is an excellent replacement for the second car (or, if you live in a convenient enough place, first car)</p>

I also have two kids and I've managed to work it out with just two seats on my bike (one front, one back) and now that the big one is tall enough to ride his bike I've got a "follow-me tandem" which allow me to tug him uphill, but carrying sports equipment is starting to be a hassle, so I'm seriously considering buying a cargo ebike to replace my current set-up.</p>

We have infamously small city blocks so all those intersections make driving a car very slow through the city and for good reason as it's safer. If you hop on a bike and take a greenway that has all the stop signs facing perpendicular traffic you can zoom around the city no problem. It's the exact same amount of time (from door to desk) for me to drive to work as it is to bike to work (including the shower). It's just shy of 7 miles. No brainer.</p>

 - a Sebo E3 Premium canister vacuum ($950 after using resellers 10% off offer)</p><p>Our family's traditional standup vacuum (I forgot which brand but they're almost all identical) died after a few years of use and we were fed up with having to replace it. Most consumer vacuums available in the US suffer significantly from planned obsolescence, so I did some research and came across this German import Sebo e3 canister vacuum. Previously I had never heard of canister vacuums, they're literally never advertised in the US. Apparently Shark makes a few, but I had to specifically google "shark canister vacuum" to find them as there is no mention of them on their official website. It only took a couple raving reviews of canister vacuums to convince me of their potential, so I took the plunge with the Sebo.</p><p>I can safely say that this vacuum is a complete gamechanger. It is so much quieter, lighter, maneuverable, easy to use, and cleaner. No longer do floating dust particles cloud the windows' sun rays. No longer does my cat appear covered in dust because she found a spot I neglected to clean. No longer do I have to worry about breaking a weakening but crucial plastic clip or retainer when emptying the vacuum. Every part that experiences stress is metal and designed for longevity rather than aesthetics. Dare I say I even enjoy vacuuming now! It used to be a pain to lug around an entire upright vacuum over every square inch of the floor. Even the bags are better than emptying a canister. The bags are biodegradable and seal inside the vacuum, meaning dust never has a chance to escape. I used to have to empty the canister vacuum outside because of how much dust it released. Yes, the high price tag is rather intimidating for a vacuum purchase, but it's well worthwhile as it's been going for four years strong with absolutely zero issues. Also, most US resellers offer 10% off if you just call them to order it.</p></div></td></tr>

Comes with TSA Pre and Global Entry.</p><p>- ChatGPT $20/mth and Claude $20/mth. Completely changed how I ideate and work.</p><p>- Cosori Air Fryer $70 + a stack of wax paper. Changes my food bill and health. I can buy a bunch of healthy stuff from Costco, and make delicious meals daily in under 20 mins.</p><p>- AirTags ($28/piece). I tag my car, my luggage, my wallet, my keys, etc. And I never get anxious again.</p><p>- Black socks from Amazon. I bought 17 pairs of identical black socks, so I don’t ever have to match socks again. I can just grab any two.</p><p>- Samsers folding Bluetooth Keyboard $60. I pair this compact foldable keyboard with my iPhone and iPad, so I can type with an actual keyboard anywhere I go.</p><p>There are also a bunch of high quality grooming tools like a Panasonic electric razor, Tweezerman tweezers, rounded scissors, etc. that improveme my quality of life. There’s also a clever porcelain $4 toothbrush holder from Muji that is amazing. There’s also a toothpaste squeezer from Amazon.</p><p>Health wise, I’ve gotten better sleep from heavy curtains which blocks street noise. Also a wedge pillow has helped decrease snoring. An Aroma USB heated eye mask has helped with dry eye.</p><p>Under $1000:</p><p>- $180 per pair - 2 pairs of AirPods Pro 2. ANC for 10 hour work day, peace of mind.</p><p>- $200 Apple Watch Series 7. I charge it twice a day when I shower but otherwise I wear it all the time. Great for health tracking and sleep alarm, but it’s most useful feature for me is Apple Pay. I pay for stuff with a double click on the dial, no need to whip out my phone. It also unlocks my Mac automatically. I used to wear Tissots but no more. I’m sold on Apple Watch.</p><p>- $180 Levoit humidifier</p><p>- $200 Coway Air purifier.</p><p>- $100 Allbirds shoes. They’re expensive but I’ve had mine for 4 years, worn daily. They’re tech bro shoes but they do live up to their reputation.</p><p>- $120 Patagonia Better Sweater vest. This is more of a finance bro getup but it is warm and pairs with anything and still looks smarter than a hoodie. This matters. As much as tech people don’t care about dressing well, the person who dresses just a bit better gets taken just a bit more seriously. Humans are hardwired for superficial things unfortunately.</p><p>- $150/week up to deductible (I have HSA so high deductible but folks on FSA can get therapy for more cheaper plus most therapists have sliding scale). Best investment ever is weekly therapy sessions. I’ve worked through so many things that I’m a much more regulated person and am able to heal from a lot of stuff that were affecting new relationships. I wish I did this 20 years sooner.</p></div></td></tr>

Faster than cars in SF often. 2x as fast as trains usually.</p><p>- Command Strips: Easiest way to stick things on walls. Cheap from Costco</p><p>- Costco Membership: Higher quality of customer. Makes everything better</p><p>- Cast Iron / Carbon Steel pans: These are great, and a lot less trouble than people make them out to be. I do wash them myself (no dishwasher) which is primary annoyance, but the oiling is easy and they do stay non-stick!</p><p>- Carbon Steel knives: I picked up a couple in Japan, wife had some from SF.

						<p>W3C is pleased to announce the formation of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/ig/sustainableweb/">Sustainable Web Interest Group</a>. The mission of the Sustainable Web Interest Group is to improve digital sustainability so that the Web works better for all people and the planet. The digital industry is responsible for 2-5% of global emissions, more than the aviation industry. If the Internet were a country it would be one of the top five polluters. The amount of water, energy, and minerals required increases annually, often putting the burden on developing economies.&nbsp;</p><p>The Sustainable Web IG will publish the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/">Web Sustainability Guidelines (WSG)</a>. This set of guidelines and <a href="https://github.com/w3c/sustyweb">associated materials</a> were drafted by the Sustainable Web Design Community Group. The WSG explains how to design and implement digital products and services that put people and the planet first. The guidelines are best practices based on measurable, evidence-based research; aimed at end-users, web workers, stakeholders, tool authors, educators, and policymakers. They are in line with the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sustainablewebmanifesto.com/">Sustainable Web Manifesto</a> and aligned with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.globalreporting.org/standards/">GRI Standards</a> and the <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/">UN Sustainable Development Goals</a> to help organizations incorporate digital products and services into broader sustainability reporting initiatives.&nbsp;These guidelines will enable people to better understand the Internet’s impact on sustainability reporting. This includes emissions as well as stewardship principles.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to publishing the guidelines, the IG plans to liaise with regulatory bodies to improve compliance targets. The membership of the community group from which this IG grew has excellent relationships with many organizations that will enable open discussions.&nbsp;</p><p>The Sustainable Web IG will be chaired by Tim Frick of MightyBytes, Ines Akrap, an Invited Expert from StoryBlok, and Mike Gifford, an Invited Expert who works for Civic Actions. Alexander Dawson will continue as editor. I, Tzviya Siegman, will be Team Contact of the group.</p><p>The group will work to improve measurability, which will enable more accurate information about sustainability and create more educational materials to enable implementations of the Web Sustainability Guidelines.&nbsp;</p><p>We look forward to enabling a more sustainable Web and hope you will <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/ig/sustainableweb/">join us</a>.</p>

<p><span>This is not mere poetics; it reflects a fundamental truth about how our brains process information.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Research shows that intuition originates in the nonverbal regions of our brain, particularly the basal ganglia and anterior cingulate cortex. These regions process patterns outside of our conscious awareness.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>When we try to put intuitive insights into words, we often end up with rationalization rather than explanation. The verbal parts of our brain, while trying to construct a coherent narrative, fill in gaps with plausible but potentially false explanations.<!--more--></span><span></span></p>
<p><span><strong>The Intelligence of Intuition</strong></span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Despite its mysterious nature, intuition is not magical—it's a form of unconscious intelligence. As researcher Gerd Gigerenzer argues, intuition operates through “smart heuristics”—simple, efficient rules our brains construct to handle real-world complexities. These mental shortcuts aren't irrational; they're sophisticated tools developed through years of experience.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Herbert Simon, another decision-making researcher, said expert intuition is "nothing more and nothing less than recognition."</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Simply put, you can only connect the dots in new and unexpected ways if you have many dots to connect. This is why broad experience is essential for developing reliable intuition.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Reed Hastings' decision to pivot Netflix into original content production is a great example. Many analysts criticized his decision, saying it was safer to stay focused on licensing existing content. But Hastings' intuition, based on years of experience in entertainment and technology, recognized patterns pointing to a different future. Today, we’re living in that future.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span><strong>The Competence Connection</strong></span><span></span></p>
<p><span>The reliability of intuition is intimately linked to your level of competence in a specific domain.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Gary Klein's research on naturalistic decision-making shows how professionals make effective decisions in real-world settings through pattern recognition gained from experience.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>At the unconscious competence level, where skills and knowledge are so deeply internalized that they’ve become second nature, intuition is remarkably reliable.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Leaders at this stage often don't need to double-check their gut feelings; their pattern recognition is highly refined and accurate.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>However, at the conscious competence stage—where you're skilled but still need to think through decisions deliberately—intuition is less reliable. Here, analytical frameworks and mental models should lead the way. But even at this stage, intuition can be a final litmus test for decisions.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span><strong>The Litmus Test</strong></span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Contrary to common wisdom, which suggests using analysis to verify gut feelings, intuition often works better as a final check on analytical decisions.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>If you've carefully analyzed a situation but something still feels wrong, that discomfort deserves attention. It might signal that your unconscious mind has recognized a pattern your conscious analysis missed. This is particularly true in uncertain and dynamic situations where, as Gigerenzer points out, logical analysis often falls short.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>However—and this is critical—your response to this intuitive discomfort should depend on your competence level in the decision domain.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>If you're at unconscious competence, that gut feeling might be worth listening to. If you're at conscious competence, it might simply reflect unfamiliarity with new territory.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span><strong>The Self-Awareness Imperative</strong></span><span></span></p>
<p><span>This brings us to perhaps the most critical skill for leveraging intuition effectively: self-awareness. Leaders must accurately assess their competence level in different domains to know how much to trust their intuition versus analysis. This self-knowledge helps calibrate the balance between gut feeling and analytical reasoning.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span><strong>The Quiet Guide</strong></span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Ultimately, intuition in leadership is less like a lighthouse showing the way and more like a quiet guide tapping you on the shoulder when something deserves a second look.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>It works best when we create space for it to operate naturally, with a clear awareness of when—and how much—to trust its guidance.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>The most effective leaders understand this delicate balance. They know when to let their experience-based intuition lead the way, when to rely on careful analysis, and perhaps most importantly, when that quiet tap on the shoulder means it's time to look again.</span><span></span></p>

Codebuff is like Cursor Composer, but in your terminal: it modifies files based on your natural language requests. You can try it with `npm i -g codebuff` and start using it immediately for free. We have no login gate, and we give all accounts up to $20 worth of credits.</p><p>Codebuff is different because we simplified the input to one step: you type what you want done in your terminal and hit enter. Then Codebuff looks through your whole codebase and makes the edits it wants, to existing source files or new ones. It also can run your tests, the type checker, or install packages to fulfill your request.</p><p>Demo video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQ0NOMsu0dA" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQ0NOMsu0dA</a></p><p>It all started at a hackathon. I was trying out Sonnet 3.5 which had recently come out and seeing if I could use it to write code. The script I cobbled together that day pulled codebase context in one step and used it to rewrite files with changes in the second step. This two step process still exists today. Incidentally, my hackathon script worked rather poorly and my demo failed to produce any useful code.</p><p>But that weekend I thought about the kind of errors it made, and realized that with more context on our codebase, it might have been able to get the change right. For example, it tried to create an endpoint on our server (at my previous startup), but it didn't know that you needed to edit 3 specific files to do this (yeah... our backend was not that clean). So I hand-wrote a guide to our codebase, like I was instructing a new hire. I put it in a markdown file and passed it into Sonnet 3.5's system prompt.  And the crazy thing is that it started producing wayyy better code. So, I started getting excited. In fact, this code guide idea still exists in Codebuff today as knowledge.md files which are automatically read on every request.</p><p>I didn't think of this project as a startup idea at first. I thought it was just a simple script anyone could write. But after another week, I could see there were more problems to solve and it should be a product.</p><p>In the week between applying to YC and the interview, I could not get Codebuff to edit files consistently. I tried many prompting strategies to get it to replace strings in the original file, but nothing worked reliably. How could I face my interviewer if I could not get something basic like this to work? On the day before my interview, in a Hail Mary attempt, I fine-tuned GPT-4o to turn Claude's sketch of changes into a git patch, which would add and remove lines to make the edits. I only finished generating the training data late at night, and the fine-tuning job ran as I slept.</p><p>And, holy hell, the next morning it worked! I pushed it to production just in time for my YC interview with Dalton. Soon after, Brandon joined and we were off to the races.</p><p>So, how does Codebuff work exactly? You invoke it in your terminal, and it starts by running through the source files in that directory and subdirectories and parsing out all the function and class names (or equivalents in 11 languages). We use the tree-sitter library to do this. It builds out a codebase map that includes these symbols and the file tree.</p><p>Then, it fires off a request to Claude Haiku 3.5 to cache this codebase context so user inputs can be responded to with lower latency. (Prompt caching is OP!). We have a stateless server that passes messages along to Anthropic or OpenAI. We use websockets to ferry data back and forth to clients. We didn't have authentication or even a database for the first three months. Codebuff was free to install and used our API keys for all requests. Luckily, no one exploited us for too much free Claude usage haha. Major thanks to Brandon for saving this situation by building out our database (Postgres + Drizzle), server (Bun, hosted on Render, auth (using the free Auth.js), website (NextJS also hosted on Render), billing (Stripe), logging (BetterStack), and dashboard (Retool). This is the best tech stack I’ve ever had.</p><p>When the user sends an input message, we prompt Claude to pick files that would be relevant (step 1). After picking files, we load them into context and the agent responds. It invokes tools using xml tags that we parse. It literally writes out &lt;edit_file path="src/app.ts"&gt;…&lt;/edit_file&gt; to edit a particular file, and has other tags to run terminal commands, or to ask to read more files. This is all we really need, since Anthropic has already trained Claude with very similar tools reach state of the art on the SWE benchmark.</p><p>Codebuff has limited free usage, but if you like it you can pay $99/mo to get more credits. We realize this is a lot more than competitors, but that’s because we do more expensive LLM calls with more context.</p><p>We’re already seeing Codebuff used in surprising ways. One user racked up a $500 bill by building out two Flutter apps in parallel. He never even looked at the code it generated. Instead, he had long conversations with Codebuff to make progress and fix errors, until the apps were built to his satisfaction. Many users built real apps over a weekend for their teams and personal use.</p><p>Of course, those aren't the typical use cases. Users also frequently use Codebuff to write unit tests. They would build a feature in parallel with unit tests and have Codebuff do loops to fix up the code until the tests pass. They would also ask it to do drudge work like set up Oauth flows or API scaffolding.</p><p>What's really exciting with all of these examples is that we're seeing people's creativity becoming unbridled. They're spending more of their time thinking about architecture and design, instead of implementation details. It's so cool that we're just at the beginning, and the technology is only going to improve from here.</p><p>If you would want to use Codebuff inside your own systems, we have an alpha SDK that exposes the same natural language interface for your apps to call and receive code edits!

<p>The Microsoft Azure Core Upstream team is excited to announce the Hyperlight project, an open-source Rust library you can use to execute small, embedded functions using hypervisor-based protection for each function call at scale. And it can do it at a speed that enables each function request to have its own hypervisor for protection. That’s fast. That’s new.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this post, we’ll go deeper into the motivation behind creating Hyperlight, explain how Hyperlight works under the hood, and finally, go through a basic code example. Keep reading to learn more about Hyperlight. Or, if you want to jump right in and get started with Hyperlight, visit the project’s <a href="https://aka.ms/hyperlight-dev" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GitHub repositories</a>.&nbsp;</p>

					</div>



<h2 id="why-fast-and-secure-are-hard">Why fast and secure are hard&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</h2>



<p>Running things securely <em>and</em> quickly is a core objective for Microsoft, as it is for any number of developers and organizations around the world. Doing both is very hard.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>If security is your highest priority, as it is for a public cloud like Microsoft Azure, you use a <strong>virtual machine</strong><em> </em>(VM) managed by a hypervisor such as Hyper-V or Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM). While secure, VMs are not known for having fast cold starts or a small footprint—though modern ones can be faster and smaller in comparison to those built a decade ago. Hypervisors have been the battle-tested wall between untrusted code and trusted applications for more than 20 years. Hyper-V, for example, is a foundational component of Azure and has delivered on that promise for many years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cold start performance is critical to running small bits of code that respond to events. Prior to Hyperlight, to achieve low-latency cold starts, infrastructure providers needed to keep warm VMs at the ready to execute these bits of code. Each VM can only be used by a single customer as it is the secure isolation boundary between their code and other customers’ code. Additionally, these functions often use a small amount of compute resources themselves and are often overshadowed by the compute resources required to run the VM itself. This costs money and wastes compute resources.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>







<p>We built Hyperlight as a library to execute functions as fast as possible while isolating those functions within a VM. Developers and software architects can use Hyperlight to add serverless customizations to their application that are able to securely run untrusted code. Hyperlight enables these customizations in a wide range of scenarios: for Internet of Things (IoT) gateway function embedding, usage in industrial automation, high-throughput cloud services, and so on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hyperlight is able to create new VMs in one to two milliseconds. While this is still slower than using sandboxed runtimes like V8 or Wasmtime directly, with Hyperlight we can take those same runtimes and place them inside of a VM that provides additional protection in the event of a sandbox escape.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>To give you a sense of how fast Hyperlight is, a one to two millisecond cold start for each VM is fast enough that it becomes practical to spin up VMs as needed in response to events. That <em>also </em>makes it possible to scale to zero, meaning that depending upon your application, you might not need to keep any VMs idling just in case any work comes in. That’s not as fast as native functions or sandboxed runtimes, but it is significantly more secure, and about two orders of magnitude faster than traditional VM architectures:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>&lt; 0.03 milliseconds</strong>: The time it takes to start a new Wasmtime sandbox&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>1-2 milliseconds</strong>: The time it takes to spawn a new Hyperlight micro-VM&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>&gt; 120 milliseconds</strong>: The time it takes to spawn an optimized, traditional VM&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="not-your-standard-hypervisor-manager">Not your standard hypervisor manager&nbsp;</h2>



<p>We’ve made some pretty big claims in this post so far, and many of you will rightfully be wondering how we’re able to claim several orders of magnitude improvement on cold start speeds for something as ubiquitous as VMs. The short answer is: by doing significantly less work. The following diagram shows at a very high level how Hyperlight works to deliver on its requirements.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://opensource.microsoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Hyperlight-1-2-seconds-png.webp" alt="graphical user interface" srcset="" data-orig-src="https://opensource.microsoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Hyperlight-1-2-seconds-png.webp"></figure>



<p>Rather than creating generalized compute environments intended to host traditional operating systems, all Hyperlight does is create a linear slice of memory and assign it a virtual central processing unit (CPU). There is no virtual device mapping, no booting of kernels, and no starting of processes—at least, not in a traditional way. Within Hyperlight, we run so-called <strong>VM guests</strong>. These are special programs that combine a specialized kernel with an application runtime into a single loadable program.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Using Hyperlight, applications can execute user-supplied code and users can have the confidence that the application is protected from the function code by a hypervisor but take advantage of the speed of the function engine. This creates new opportunities for serverless embedding, whether using <a href="https://aka.ms/wasm-components" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WebAssembly components</a> or other kinds of processes, like standalone C or Rust functions, both of which have examples in the repository. &nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="using-hyperlight-from-rust">Using Hyperlight from Rust&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Alright, it’s time to actually take a look at what it’s like to use Hyperlight from the Rust programming language. In this sample, we’ll be using a pre-defined “simple” guest which exposes a single function: “PrintOutput”. We’re going to be calling that function with a custom string to print. We’re also going to show how we can expose functions from the VM host to the VM guest.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We first start by defining our imports. Hyperlight has a dedicated library for setting up the VM host, multiple custom VM guests, and another common library for types and functionality shared by the host and guest.&nbsp;</p>


<div><pre title="">use std::thread; 
use std::time::Duration; 
use hyperlight_common::flatbuffer_wrappers::function_types::{ParameterValue, ReturnType}; 
use hyperlight_host::func::HostFunction0; 
use hyperlight_host::sandbox_state::sandbox::EvolvableSandbox; 
use hyperlight_host::sandbox_state::transition::Noop; 
use hyperlight_host::{MultiUseSandbox, UninitializedSandbox}; 
</pre></div>


<p>In Rust binaries, we use fn main as their entry point, which we’ll be doing here. First things first: we’re going to create a new sandbox that has not yet been initialized. To do that, we need to provide it with a guest, which in this case we’re getting from our utility testing library.&nbsp;</p>


<div><pre title="">fn main() -&gt; hyperlight_host::Result&lt;()&gt; { 
    let guest = hyperlight_testing::simple_guest_as_string().unwrap(); 
    let guest = hyperlight_host::GuestBinary::FilePath(guest); 
    let mut uninit_sandbox = UninitializedSandbox::new( 
        guest, 
        None, // default configuration 
        None, // default run options 
        None, // default host print function 
    )?; 
</pre></div>


<p>With our guest program loaded into the sandbox, we can now begin to do additional things with our sandbox. Though our guest won’t be calling this function, let’s register a function “sleep_5_seconds” that sleeps the host for five seconds. You can think of this as registering a new system call that is available to the VM guest.&nbsp;</p>


<div><pre title="">    fn sleep_5_secs() -&gt; hyperlight_host::Result&lt;()&gt; { 
        thread::sleep(Duration::from_secs(5)); 
        Ok(()) 
    } 
    let sleep_5_secs = Arc::new(Mutex::new(sleep_5_secs)); 
    sleep_5_secs.register(&amp;mut uninit_sandbox, "Sleep5Secs")?; 
</pre></div>


<p>Now that we’re done setting up our sandbox, it’s time to create a snapshot of the current sandbox state. This is done by calling the “evolve” method, which will change our sandbox from uninitialized to initialized. This kind of snapshotting is useful for real workloads, where typically you’ll want to load a guest, load a program into the guest, and then snapshot that so the future initialization cost is amortized.&nbsp;</p>


<div><pre title="">let mut sandbox: MultiUseSandbox = uninit_sandbox.evolve(Noop::default())?;&nbsp;
</pre></div>


<p>With that, we’re ready to call functions inside the VM guest. We’re going to be calling the “PrintOutput” function with the string: “Hello from the VM guest”. This will print the message to stdout and then return. While this may end up feeling a little more verbose than making regular function calls, everything about this should feel familiar.&nbsp;</p>


<div><pre title="">    let fn_name = "PrintOutput"; // function defined by the VM guest 
    let ret_ty = ReturnType::Int; 
    let message = "Hello from a VM guest!\n".to_string(); 
    let params = Some(vec![ParameterValue::String(message)]); 
    let result = sandbox.call_guest_function_by_name(fn_name, ret_ty, params); 
    assert!(result.is_ok()); 
    Ok(()) 
} 
</pre></div>


<p>And that’s it! If we run the code it should print: “Hello from the guest VM” and exit successfully. Congrats, you now understand the basics of Hyperlight.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="the-path-forward">The path forward&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Microsoft is pleased to share that Hyperlight will be submitted to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) as a sandbox project. The intent is for Hyperlight to benefit from the CNCF community’s guidance, support, governance, best practices, and resources. Hyperlight’s&nbsp;incubation and submission to a foundation builds on Microsoft efforts to empower developers by creating open, flexible technology for cloud and edge applications.&nbsp;Our recent work with WebAssembly in the <a href="https://www.spinkube.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SpinKube project</a> is part of that work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We believe our latest contribution, Hyperlight, can be a vital part of the cloud-native landscape and help advance cloud-native technologies. &nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="get-involved-with-hyperlight">Get involved with Hyperlight&nbsp;</h2>



<p>As an open-source project licensed under the Apache 2.0 license, Hyperlight underscores Microsoft’s commitment to fostering innovation and collaboration within the tech community. We welcome developers, solution architects, and IT professionals to help build and enhance Hyperlight.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        

        

        <p>After 15 years, Google banned me from <a href="https://voice.google.com/">Google Voice</a>.
This post is a summary of what happened, with the hope that it might help
someone in the future who runs into the same situation. <a href="#retrospective">At the
end</a>, I have some
thoughts about the latent danger of being banned from Google at any time with no
notice.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background<a href="#background"></a></h2>
<p>I got my first cell phone in high school and immediately signed up for Google
Voice simply because I wanted to be able to send and receive texts from my
computer. So my Google Voice number is the only one I’ve ever given out to
friends, and I use it as my phone number whenever I can. The only time I use my
“real” Verizon phone number is when I can’t receive verification codes because
some services block <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_over_IP">VoIP</a> numbers.</p>
<p>That was a minor annoyance, and I’ve loved being able to text and even call from
any device, even if my phone was off or not in service (e.g. traveling
internationally). So I stuck with it for 15 years. My only worry has been that
it seems like another product that Google could easily decide to kill off and
send to the <a href="https://killedbygoogle.com/">Google graveyard</a> at any moment. But
that turned out to be the wrong worry for me.</p>
<h2 id="getting-banned">Getting Banned<a href="#getting-banned"></a></h2>
<p>My problems started on October 4, 2024. I got a notification on my phone saying
I had been logged out of my Google account. This had never happened to me
before, and I thought someone might be trying to hack into my account. I was
concerned but not terribly worried because I had two-factor authentication
turned on. On my personal laptop, I saw a notification that I had been logged
out of Google Drive.</p>
<p>I logged back in on my phone and laptop, going through two-factor authentication
both times. Then I checked the <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/notifications">security
log</a> for my Google account. I saw
that my account had been disabled at 12:55 pm, but the log didn’t have any
details about why. Logging back in had restored my account at 2:38 pm.</p>
<p>The log didn’t have any other security activity, like login attempts. I even
reviewed my <a href="https://myactivity.google.com/">full Google activity</a> but didn’t see
anything that I didn’t recognize.  Everything seemed back to normal, so I went
back to work.</p>
<p>A few hours later, I tried sending some pictures in a group text in Google
Voice. The first picture went through fine. But when I tried to send a second
one, I received an error message that said something like “Sorry, there was an
error. Please try again later.” I retried a few times. Then I tried sending a
plain text message to my wife and got the same error.</p>
<p>I was worried that it was related to my account being deactivated, but the
optimist in me thought that maybe Google Voice was having an outage. Until I got
home and went on my laptop to check Google Voice in my browser. It redirected me
to <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/40039?p=grandcentral">this Google support
page</a> with this
message:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>My heart sank. Getting banned by Google’s automated systems is a situation that
I have read <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=hacker+news+google+account+disabled+site:news.ycombinator.com">plenty of
stories</a>
about, and I had an idea of what was next: a Kafkaesque situation in which I
would probably never talk to an actual human being, I’d never get any useful
details, and I would likely be forced to accept losing my phone number.</p>
<p>I tried making an outbound call. It didn’t work. I asked my wife to call me.
That didn’t work either. I asked my wife to text me. From her perspective, it
looked like it worked, but I never received it. That was even worse because it
meant that anyone who texted me wouldn’t get any indication that anything was
wrong.</p>
<h2 id="first-appeal">First Appeal<a href="#first-appeal"></a></h2>
<p>The Google support page advised me to <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/contact/suspended">submit a
form</a> appealing the
suspension. I did so immediately, explaining that I was suspended right after
sending a picture and noting that I had been logged out of my Google account
earlier in the day. I received an automated email:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thank you for contacting us about restoring access to your Google Account.</p>
<p>Google will review your appeal as soon as possible. Most requests take 2
business days to review, but some might take longer.</p>
<p>You may be able to download your data from some Google services. To get
started, sign in to your account. If your account is eligible, you’ll see a
link to download your data.</p>
<p>Thanks for your patience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I did try to use <a href="https://takeout.google.com/">Google Takeout</a> to export my
data, but Google Voice no longer shows up in the list of products, even though
I’m sure it did in the past because I have <a href="https://support.google.com/voice/answer/10130510?hl=en">exported my Google Voice
data</a> before. So the
suspension presumably affected that as well.</p>
<p>I subscribe to a <a href="https://one.google.com/about">Google One</a> plan. I knew that
one of the more understated benefits is the ability to get live support from an
actual person, something that is generally impossible with Google. I had nothing
to lose, so I started a chat. It ended up being a waste of time because the
person I talked to was fixated on me mentioning getting logged out of my
account. So they started recommending ways to protect my account. When I brought
the conversation back to the Google Voice suspension, they were unable to access
the ticket that was created when I submitted my appeal. So I ended the
conversation.</p>
<p>On October 6 (two days later), I heard back about my appeal:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>We have reviewed your request and cannot reinstate your Google Voice service.
Your Google Voice service has been suspended for violations of our <a href="https://support.google.com/voice/answer/9230450?hl=en">Google

<p>Thanks,</p>

</blockquote>
<h2 id="second-appeal">Second Appeal<a href="#second-appeal"></a></h2>
<p>On October 7, I submitted a second appeal. I explained that I reviewed the
Google Voice policies and did not believe I violated any of them. I never sent
large quantities of texts, I never sent commercial texts, I only texted friends
and family, and there was nothing remotely inappropriate about the picture I
sent right before I was suspended. The picture was of four adults around a baby
in a stroller on a sidewalk. The baby is dressed and even has a blanket on him.
I added that that was the only text I sent on the day I was suspended, and I
didn’t make any calls that day.</p>
<p>On October 8, I received the same reply that I got for the first appeal.</p>
<p>I considered writing this blog post immediately, posting it to Hacker News, and
hopefully getting enough traction that someone at Google would see it and do
something about it. But I didn’t bother because even on the off chance that it
worked, I wouldn’t be able to trust Google Voice again and would still want to
port my phone number out.</p>
<h2 id="reclaiming-my-number">Reclaiming My Number<a href="#reclaiming-my-number"></a></h2>
<p>At this point, porting my number out was my only priority. I didn’t want to tell
all my friends and family to use a new number. And I didn’t want to deal with
trying to update my number for a countless number of services, especially since
I’m sure it’d be a hassle for many of them without access to the old number.</p>
<p>I did some searching and learned that the Google Voice subreddit has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Googlevoice/comments/17n4zl2/google_voice_service_suspensions/">an entire
document on
suspensions</a>.
People apparently post about suspensions often enough that the subreddit
disallows threads on suspensions since there’s nothing they can do about them.</p>
<p>I found <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Googlevoice/comments/1dr47m4/account_suspended_reclaiming_your_number_and_your/">one wonderfully detailed
post</a>
(“Account Suspended - Reclaiming your Number and your Dignity; a How-To Guide”)
that has been removed because of the subreddit’s rule. But that post, as well as
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/google/comments/1filpr1/got_my_suspended_google_voice_number_back_fcc/">another
one</a>
that is still up, said the posters were able to get their numbers out by <a href="https://consumercomplaints.fcc.gov/hc/en-us">filing
complaints</a> with the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Communications_Commission">FCC</a>. So I
planned to do that, expecting the whole process to take a couple of months.</p>
<p>On October 9, I added a new line to my Verizon plan as a target for my Google
Voice number. A silver lining is that with the new line, I was able to get a new
iPhone 15 for almost free after bill credits. I initiated a port in request for
my Google Voice number. I expected the port to fail, since I was unable to
access my Google Voice account to <a href="https://support.google.com/voice/answer/1065667?hl=en">unlock the
number</a>. Then I would
submit the FCC complaint.</p>
<p>But to my pleasant surprise, the port went through in a couple of days! I
activated service on the new iPhone with my old Google Voice number. I did have
an issue where I could make calls and send and receive texts, but I couldn’t
receive calls. I called the Verizon port center (1-888-844-7095), and the person
who helped me did something on their end to truly finish off the port. After
that, I could receive calls as well. So I never needed to use the FCC’s muscle.</p>
<p>Then I did a <a href="https://www.verizon.com/support/swap-devices-faqs/">number swap</a>
between my Verizon lines so that I can use my former Google Voice number on my
Android phone instead of the iPhone.</p>
<p>After a couple of days, I looked up the number on
<a href="https://freecarrierlookup.com/">FreeCarrierLookup</a>, and it showed up as a
wireless Verizon number. Previously, it showed up as a landline, and the carrier
was <a href="https://www.bandwidth.com/">Bandwidth</a>, which is
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19049200">apparently</a> what powers Google
Voice SMS in the backend.</p>
<p>On October 23, I received an email from Google Voice saying that my number was
ported away:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello Danny Guo,</p>
<p>This email is to confirm that your Google Voice number (xxx-xxx-xxxx) has been
ported away from Google Voice. Calls made to that number will no longer ring
your forwarding phones and new voicemails won’t appear in your Google Voice
inbox.</p>
<p>Your Google Voice account has been downgraded accordingly, but your existing
voicemails and text messages remain available in your inbox. You can also
continue placing calls from Gmail.</p>
<p>You can upgrade your account at any time by getting a new Google Voice number.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>The Google Voice team</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now when I open Google Voice on my phone, it asks me to pick a new number as if
I’m starting from scratch. But on web, it still redirects me to the suspension
page.</p>
<h2 id="retrospective">Retrospective<a href="#retrospective"></a></h2>
<p>I have conflicted thoughts about what happened. I’ve used Google services for
the majority of my life. In college, I remember playing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Would_you_rather">would you
rather</a> at lunch, and a friend
asked if I’d rather lose access to everything Google or lose a physical sense. I
really had to think about it.</p>
<p>I’ve only ever used Android smartphones and smartwatches, despite being
virtually the only one among my friends and family to not have switched to
iPhone. Which makes me the person who tends to get grief for ruining group chats
by turning them into <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-apples-imessage-is-winning-teens-dread-the-green-text-bubble-11641618009">green
bubbles</a>.</p>
<p>And I directly pay Google by subscribing to Google One, YouTube Premium, and
Google Workspace (just for my custom domain email).</p>
<p>One major reason I’ve stuck with Google for so long is that I value using
services that are multiplatform. I may have an Android phone and watch, but I
also have a MacBook and an iPad.</p>
<p>And I still think Google Search can be pretty magical. Despite <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/09/google-search-size-usefulness-decline/675409/">its
decline</a>
and the fact that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model">LLM</a>s are
just better for certain searches.</p>
<h3 id="fear">Fear<a href="#fear"></a></h3>
<p>But relying on Google worries me because of all the stories I’ve read about
people being banned. Sure, some of those cases might be lacking some details
that would justify the bans, but I was convinced enough to put a lot of effort
into migrating away from Gmail several years ago. Consider how important your
email account is to your digital life and how awful it would be to suddenly lose
access to your email with no warning.</p>
<p>By now, everything important uses my custom domain email address. I do use
Google Workspace for it, so i’m technically still using Gmail. But the point is
that I control the address. If Google bans me one day, all I have to do is
update my DNS records to switch to something like
<a href="https://www.fastmail.com/">Fastmail</a>.</p>
<p>The possibility of a Google ban is also one small reason I haven’t gotten into
Android development. I could <a href="https://medium.com/@antaresone/google-just-terminated-my-google-play-developer-account-forever-f62d6362b6ac">accidentally violate their
terms</a>
and get banned from publishing apps in an instant.</p>
<p>And I deliberately do not take any pictures of my infant son nude on the off
chance it <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/21/technology/google-surveillance-toddler-photo.html">gets flagged as child sexual abuse
material</a>
after being uploaded into Google Photos, and my entire Google account is banned.
With my recent situation, I consider myself lucky that I was at least only
banned from Google Voice.</p>
<p>It says something that my biggest issue with Google isn’t that their services
aren’t good anymore or that they kill things off all the time. It’s that I’m
afraid they will just ban me with no recourse. It finally happened, and it
wasn’t even for a service that I was worried about.</p>
<h3 id="caveats">Caveats<a href="#caveats"></a></h3>
<p>I work in software and in fintech. I can understand that Google operates at such
a massive scale that many things have to be automated, and even if there are
some false positives, that could be a worthy tradeoff to Google to not have to
put humans into the loop.</p>
<p>I also understand the logic of not telling people what rules they broke because
you don’t want bad actors to get a better understanding of the system because
that would allow them to fine tune their attacks accordingly.</p>
<h3 id="curiosity">Curiosity<a href="#curiosity"></a></h3>
<p>But I’m still frustrated about temporarily losing my phone number. Sure I never
paid for Google Voice, but Google never gave me an option to pay for it. In this
case, I would have happily paid $100 just to find out why exactly I was banned.
What rule or model decided I needed to be banned?</p>
<p>Part of it is curiosity. Was the last picture I sent the issue? Getting logged
out of my phone earlier in the day suggests it wasn’t. But I didn’t do anything
else on Google Voice that day, and I barely sent any texts or made any calls in
the days before. I’m confident that if a real person looked at my account,
they’d agree something in the automation went wrong. You may have some
skepticism. Unfortunately, I can’t provide my activity, since I can’t see it
anymore after the app recognized that my number was ported out. But I’m <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Googlevoice/comments/1fcw44j/google_voice_exit_strategy_update/">not the
only
one</a>
dealing with this kind of a situation.</p>
<p>I wonder if I should be more upset. Maybe I should actually try to vote with my
wallet and switch to that iPhone, move my files from Google Drive to iCloud or
Dropbox, and migrate to Fastmail. But I know Google can afford to simply not
care.</p>

				<p><span>What if the future of energy could be as limitless as the stars? As nuclear fission powers today’s reactors, researchers are looking toward nuclear fusion as a cleaner, safer, and long-lasting source of energy.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Nuclear power plants are largely considered as one of the most reliable sources of energy. Inside the plants, reactors use fission to heat water into steam, which is then used to spin turbines and produce carbon-free electricity. However, nuclear fission produces nuclear waste, which requires great amounts of regulation for safe storage and disposal.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Nuclear fusion, on the other hand, does not create long term radioactive waste. For years, scientists and experts have been looking to harness the power of nuclear fusion, but there has been no long term success due to the incredible amounts of pressure and high temperatures required in the nuclear fusion process.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A team of researchers have been working on potential solutions to this issue for the past three years.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The Nuclear Fusion Project is the result of a collaboration between Carnegie Mellon Robotics Institute research professor <a href="https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/jeff-schneider/">Jeff Schneider</a>, students from both the Robotics Institute and Machine Learning Department, and the </span><a href="https://www.pppl.gov/"><span>Princeton Plasma Physics Lab</span></a><span>.</span><span> With funding from the Department of Energy, the team has been able to make significant advancements using artificial intelligence (AI) to help control the challenging dynamics of nuclear fusion.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Fission and fusion differ in how they create energy. Fission occurs when a neutron collides with a larger atom, forcing the atom to excite and split into two smaller atoms. Fusion occurs when two atoms collide and create a heavier atom, such as when two hydrogen atoms combine to create a helium atom. This process produces the intense energy that fuels the sun and stars.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“We would like to mimic that process here on Earth in some way that’s controlled,” said Jeff Schneider. “The most successful way we’ve discovered so far is with a tokamak.”</span></p>

<p><span>Inside of tokamak reactors, hydrogen is superheated until it becomes a plasma. The plasma is formed into a donut shape, which is wrapped by magnets. The magnetic fields keep the plasma in place while it is heated to the temperatures and pressures needed to create a fusion reaction.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“The problem is all the dynamics of the process are non-linear and unstable,” said Schneider. “What we’re doing is using AI to learn those dynamics and, more importantly, learn controllers that do online adjustments at high speeds to keep the plasma in place.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In June, the team brought together AI experts and plasma physicists to conduct experiments with the tokamak at the <a href="https://d3dfusion.org/">DIII-D National Fusion Facility</a> in San Diego.</span><span>&nbsp;The team focused on using machine learning algorithms to prevent a plasma instability known as a tearing mode. By employing a heating method similar to microwave technology, they targeted the heating to suppress tearing modes. As a result, they successfully reduced their occurrence during the experiment. A paper detailing these exciting results is currently in progress.</span></p>
<p><span>The Department of Energy has renewed its grant, providing an additional three years of funding for the team’s research. Building on their previous successes, they are preparing for their next experiment, which aims to further investigate the application of reinforcement learning in controlling key aspects of plasma behavior. This ongoing work is positioning Carnegie Mellon University as one of the leaders in global nuclear fusion research.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The implications of successful nuclear fusion are immense, offering a clean and abundant energy source that has the potential to help mitigate major global issues like climate change, water scarcity, and food distribution. As Carnegie Mellon and its partners push the boundaries of this work, they maximize their potential to revolutionize energy and ensure a more sustainable planet for generations to come.</span></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>2024-11-07 13:09</p>
<p>Instant messaging is dominated by mainstream apps today, each with their own ecosystems, closed protocols, and business models based on data collection and user engagement. In this landscape, XMPP (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol) might seem like a relic, yet it offers a powerful, open, and privacy-respecting alternative that deserves more recognition. Despite its versatility and potential, XMPP has struggled to gain the popularity it deserves. Here, we'll explore why XMPP hasn't reached widespread adoption, why it remains relevant, and how it might be the best option for those seeking a flexible, secure, and open-source messaging tool.</p>
<h3>What makes XMPP unique?</h3>
<p>XMPP isn't just a messaging protocol; it's a foundational technology that provides decentralized, extensible communication. Built on XML, it supports a variety of messaging types (text, voice, video, and even file transfer) without being locked to a single platform or app. Since it's an open protocol, anyone can run their own XMPP server, maintain complete control of their data, and use any compatible client.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://xmpp.org/software/?platform=all-platforms">the wide array of XMPP clients</a> available across all major operating systems (Linux, Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, KaiOS), users have a choice to pick the interface and features that suit them best. XMPP has a rich ecosystem of clients that cater to different preferences, from simple, lightweight clients to those packed with advanced features. And with <a href="https://xmpp.org/software/?platform=all-platforms">a plethora of servers</a> that can be self-hosted, including open-source options like <a href="https://prosody.im/">Prosody</a> and <a href="https://www.ejabberd.im/">ejabberd</a>, setting up a personal or community server is accessible, even for those with modest technical skills.</p>
<h3>Security and privacy with XMPP</h3>
<p>One of XMPP's major strengths is its potential for secure communication. Out of the box, XMPP can already secure messages with TLS encryption. However, it becomes much more versatile when you activate specific XEPs (XMPP Extension Protocols). Here are some that make XMPP even more robust and useful:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>OMEMO (XEP-0384)</strong>: provides end-to-end encryption that ensures messages can't be read by anyone except the intended recipient(s), offering privacy similar to Signal's protocol.</li>
<li><strong>MAM (Message Archive Management, XEP-0313)</strong>: allows message synchronization across devices by enabling server-side message archiving, making it possible to retain and access message history across different clients without sacrificing privacy.</li>
<li><strong>Message Carbons (XEP-0280)</strong>: enables message synchronization across multiple devices by copying outgoing and incoming messages, ensuring conversations are consistent across all connected clients.</li>
<li><strong>HTTP File Upload (XEP-0363)</strong>: enables file sharing over XMPP by allowing users to upload files to a server via HTTP, making them accessible through secure links. This XEP facilitates sharing images, documents, and other files easily and securely within chats.</li>
</ul>
<p>Together, these XEPs provide a way to make XMPP a secure, synchronized, and feature-rich messaging system across devices, rivaling what proprietary apps offer without requiring you to give up control or trust a third-party service.</p>
<h3>Why doesn't XMPP have more success?</h3>
<h4>1. <strong>Lack of awareness</strong></h4>
<p>XMPP doesn't have the marketing muscle that proprietary platforms enjoy. As a protocol, it doesn't have a single corporation pushing it forward. Instead, it relies on a community of developers and volunteers. This means the average person has likely never heard of XMPP, let alone considered using it.</p>
<h4>2. <strong>Fragmentation and inconsistency</strong></h4>
<p>With XMPP, the decentralized nature can be both a strength and a weakness. Unlike a centralized service, XMPP's decentralized model means that different clients and servers can have varying levels of compatibility depending on which XEPs are supported. For users, this can create friction and a sense of inconsistency, particularly when switching between clients or servers that may not fully implement the same extensions. However, <a href="https://wiki.xmpp.org/web/Conferences/Summit_24">XMPP Summits</a> help developers to improve compatibility between software.</p>
<h4>3. <strong>Complexity and user experience</strong></h4>
<p>While setting up and running an XMPP server can be straightforward for someone with technical skills, it's not as effortless as signing up for a mainstream app. For the non-tech-savvy user, terms like "XEP", "OMEMO", and even "server" may feel overwhelming. XMPP's vast configurability is appealing to those who enjoy flexibility, but it can be daunting for users accustomed to more user-friendly apps. If you don't want to install an XMPP server, <a href="https://providers.xmpp.net/">just join an existing one</a>!</p>
<h4>4. <strong>Network effect</strong></h4>
<p>Mainstream messaging apps benefit from the network effect: the more people who use them, the more useful they become. XMPP has struggled to build this critical mass. When users open an XMPP client and see an empty contact list, they're likely to revert to apps where their friends, family, and colleagues are already present. If you have an XMPP address, share it with your contacts (as you do with your email address).</p>
<h3>Why XMPP is still the right tool for many</h3>
<p>For privacy advocates, technologists, and those who value control over their data, XMPP remains a compelling choice. Its decentralized architecture prevents single points of failure and <strong>mitigates risks of censorship or data exploitation</strong>. The fact that it's open-source means that the community can continually audit, improve, and adapt XMPP to new security standards without relying on a corporation's goodwill.</p>
<p>Even more, XMPP has a place in niches where decentralized control and configurability are essential. Many organizations, communities, and even countries with stringent data privacy laws are looking to open protocols like XMPP for their communication needs. Developers working on SmolWeb, IndieWeb, and LowTech projects may find that XMPP aligns with their principles far better than any centralized, corporate-owned platform.</p>
<h3>The future of XMPP</h3>
<p>For XMPP to gain traction, it needs a stronger ecosystem of clients with user-friendly interfaces and seamless integration of essential XEPs like OMEMO and MAM. Additionally, a larger user base could help dispel the perception that XMPP is only for "techies". Projects and communities like <a href="https://conversations.im/">Conversations</a> (on Android), <a href="https://dino.im/">Dino</a>, <a href="https://gajim.org/">Gajim</a> or <a href="https://www.kaidan.im/">Kaidan</a> (for desktop), <a href="https://siskin.im/">Siskin</a> or <a href="https://monal-im.org/">Monal</a> (for iOS) and <a href="https://git.disroot.org/badrihippo/convo">Convo</a> (for KaiOS) are working to close the user experience gap, making it easier for people to join and use XMPP networks without a technical background.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as concerns about data privacy and digital sovereignty grow, XMPP's appeal could increase among users and developers looking for alternatives to surveillance-heavy platforms. If more users discover the freedom and flexibility of XMPP, we might see a resurgence in interest, with new communities forming around this open standard.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Whether you're looking to host your own server, control your data, or explore an alternative to centralized platforms, XMPP is worth a look. If you are aware of the benefits of federated networks such as Fediverse or Email, XMPP should become your instant messaging tool!</p>

				<h3>from the <i>if-you-build-it-they-will-come</i> dept</h3>
				


				<p>For years we’ve noted how U.S. broadband is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/09/20/as-net-neutrality-debate-reheats-remember-the-real-problem-is-telecom-monopoly-power/">expansive, patchy, and slow</a>&nbsp;thanks to mindless consolidation, regulatory capture, regional monopolization, and limited competition. That’s resulted in a growing number of pissed off towns, cities, cooperatives, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2021/02/18/chattanooga-built-own-broadband-network-now-top-ranked-work-home-city-us/">city-owned utilities</a>&nbsp;building their own, locally-owned broadband networks in a bid for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/05/31/community-owned-broadband-network-again-tops-list-of-most-popular-isps/">better, cheaper, faster broadband</a>.</p>
<p>Regional giants like Comcast, Charter, or AT&amp;T could have responded to this organic trend by offering better, cheaper, faster service. But ultimately they found it far cheaper to undermine these efforts via&nbsp;<a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/06/02/telecom-lobbyists-have-had-the-fcc-under-their-boot-heel-for-7-straight-years-and-nobody-much-seems-to-care/">regulatory capture</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2024/01/03/republicans-trying-to-kill-program-that-brings-affordable-broadband-to-the-poor/">congressional lobbying</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/04/comcast-brings-fiber-to-city-that-it-sued-7-years-ago-to-stop-fiber-rollout/">lawsuits</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/04/24/dumb-state-laws-blocking-community-broadband-could-mar-historic-subsidy-efforts/">protectionist state laws</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2014/08/04/minority-astroturf-group-gets-comcast-affiliated-news-site-to-remove-article-about-minority-astroturfing-net-neutrality/">misleading disinformation</a>.</p>
<p>Currently <a href="https://communitynets.org/content/state-state-preemption-stalled-moving-more-competitive-direction?mc_cid=229ee1be3f&amp;mc_eid=eb527a594e">sixteen states have laws</a> — usually ghost written by regional telecom monopolies — restrict or outright ban community broadband. Some of these laws are outright bans on community broadband, basically letting Comcast or AT&amp;T veto your local infrastructure voting rights. Others erect elaborate, cumbersome restrictions on the financing and expansion of such networks and <em>pretend that’s not a ban</em>. </p>
<p>The good news: The Institute For Local Self Reliance (where I study and write about broadband access) notes that these sixteen laws are a <a href="https://communitynets.org/content/state-state-preemption-stalled-moving-more-competitive-direction?mc_cid=229ee1be3f&amp;mc_eid=eb527a594e">notable reduction from the 21 state laws we had in 2020</a>. What caused the change? The pandemic home education and telecommuting boom highlighted the essential nature of broadband (or more accurately, the expensive, sluggish, terrible nature of monopoly options).</p>
<p>As a result, several states voted to roll back the efforts and <a href="https://communitynets.org/content/state-state-preemption-stalled-moving-more-competitive-direction?mc_cid=229ee1be3f&amp;mc_eid=eb527a594e">take a more serious look at community owned and operated broadband networks</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“In 2021,&nbsp;<a href="https://communitynets.org/content/arkansas-takes-huge-step-forward-removing-barriers-municipal-broadband">Arkansas</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://communitynets.org/content/washington-state-removes-all-barriers-municipal-broadband">Washington</a>&nbsp;passed legislation significantly rolling back legislative barriers on publicly owned broadband networks. In 2023,&nbsp;<a href="https://communitynets.org/content/colorado-repeal-community-broadband-ban-turning-point-decades-making">Colorado</a>&nbsp;rolled back a law that required communities to hold a referendum vote to opt out of a state ban on municipal broadband. That law was repealed after over 120 communities across the state overwhelmingly voted to opt out of the state preemption law, fueled no doubt by the&nbsp;<a href="https://communitynets.org/content/municipal-broadband-colorado-big-winners-latest-wave-state-grants">success</a>&nbsp;of the municipal networks in&nbsp;<a href="https://estespark.colorado.gov/utilities">Estes Park</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://communitynets.org/content/fort-collins-municipal-network-celebrates-20000-subscriber-milestone">Fort Collins</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://communitynets.org/content/loveland-colorados-municipal-fiber-network-crosses-finish-line">Loveland</a>. In May of 2024,&nbsp;<a href="https://communitynets.org/content/minnesota-strikes-down-preemption-laws-blocking-municipal-broadband">Minnesota</a>&nbsp;followed suit, rolling back its preemptions laws.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are numerous funding and deployment models when it comes to community broadband. Some municipalities build open access fiber networks themselves (see: <a href="https://www.utopiafiber.com/">Utah’s UTOPIA</a>), allowing for numerous competitors. Others are built off the back of city-owned electric utilities (see: <a href="https://epb.com/fi-speed-internet/?#choose-your-plan">Chattanooga’s EPB</a>). Some are fiber cooperatives (see the <a href="https://www.newamerica.org/weekly/how-did-north-dakota-become-crown-jewel-internet-midwest/">success had in North Dakota</a>). Some are public private partnerships.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/harvard-study-shows-why-big-telecom-is-terrified-of-community-run-broadband/">Data routinely shows</a> these networks provide faster, better, cheaper service than regional cable and phone giants. Staffed and backed by locals, they tend to be more in tune with the needs of locals. They’re extremely unlikely to engage in predatory pricing, privacy, or net neutrality violations. You’ll usually enjoy local customer service. They incentivize regional monopolies to actually try. </p>
<p>There’s $42.5 billion in infrastructure bill subsidies that should start reaching the states early next year. A lot of this money will land in the laps of the usual regional monopolies. But a lot of it is going to wind up in the hands of local community-owned networks, which is a dramatic policy shift from years past. As a result, companies like Charter, AT&amp;T, and Comcast have ramped up the <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2024/11/04/telecoms-bankroll-more-misleading-attacks-on-community-broadband-networks/">use of fake consumer groups built specifically to mislead locals</a>.</p>
<p>Community broadband isn’t some magic panacea. Like any other business model, it requires competent planning, intelligent financing, and stellar leadership. But it should be the democratic choice of a community whether to pursue such options. Not the decision of a Comcast executive living half a world away.</p>

<a href="https://github.com/alphapapa">Adam Porter</a> (alphapapa) reached out to <a href="https://github.com/jwiegley">John
Wiegley</a> (johnw) to ask about his current Org Mode
workflow. John figured he'd experiment with a
braindumping/brainstorming conversation about Org
Mode in the hopes of getting more thoughts out of
his head and into articles or blog posts. Instead
of waiting until someone finally gets the time to
polish it into something beautifully concise and
insightful, they decided to let me share snippets
of the transcript in case that sparks other ideas.
Enjoy!

<blockquote>
<p>
Today I was playing a lot with <a href="https://github.com/brabalan/org-review">org-review</a>. I'm
just trying to really incorporate a strong review
process because one of the things I started doing
recently is that this <a href="https://fireflies.ai/">[Fireflies AI]​</a> note taker
that's running in the background. Now, it produces
terrible transcripts, but it produces great
summaries. And at the bottom of every summary,
there's a list of all the action items that
everyone talked about associated with the names.
</p>

<p>
So I now have some automation, that will all I
have to do is download the word document and then
I have a whole process in the background that uses
Pandoc to convert it to Org Mode. Then I have
Elisp code that automatically will suck it into
the file that I dedicate to that particular
meeting.
</p>

<p>
It will auto-convert all of the action items into
Org-mode tasks where it's either a TODO if it's
for me, or if it's a task for somebody else,
tagged with their name.

Then, when I have a one-on-one with a person in
the future, I now have a one-on-one template that
populates that file, and part of the template is
under the agenda heading. It uses an a dynamic
block that I've written: a new type of dynamic
block that can pull from any agenda file. And what
it does is it [takes] from all of those meetings,
all of the action items that are still open that
are tagged with their name.
</p>

<p>
This has been actually really, really effective.
Now, I don't jump into a one-on-one being like,
"Well, I didn't prepare so I don't know what to
talk about." I've usually got like 10 to 30 items
to go through with them to just see. Did you
follow up? Did you complete this? Do we need to
talk about this more?
</p>

<p>
I want to incorporate org-review. Scheduling is
not sufficient for me to see my tasks. What I need
is something that is like scheduling, but isn't
scheduling. That's where org-review comes in. I
have a report that says: show me everything that
has never been reviewed or everything that is up
for review.
</p>

<p>
Then I have a whole Org key space within agenda
for pushing the next review date to a selected
date or a fixed quantity of time. So if I hit <code>r
r</code>, it'll prompt for the date that I want to see
that again. But if I hit <code>r w</code>, it'll just push it
out a week.
</p>

<p>
Every day I try to spend 15 minutes looking at the
review list of all the tasks that are subject for
review. I don't force myself to get through the
whole list. I count it as success if I get through
20 of the tasks. Because earlier I had 730 of
them, right? I was just chewing on them day by
day.
</p>

<p>
But now I'm building this into the Org agenda
population, because in the dynamic block match
query, I can actually say: only populate this
agenda with the tasks that are tagged for them
that are up for review. That way, if we're in the
one-on-one and they say, "Oh I'm working on that
but I won't get to it for a month," I'll say,
"Let's review that in a month." Then next week's
one-on-one won't show that tasks. I don't have to
do that mental filtering each time.
</p>

<p>
This is something I've been now using for a few
weeks. I have to say I'm still streamlining, I'm
still getting all the inertia out of the system by
automation as much as possible, but it's helping
me stay on top of a lot of tasks.
</p>

<p>
I'm surprised by how many action items every
single meeting generates. It's like, it's like
between 5 and 12 per meeting. And I have 3 to 7
meetings a day, so you can imagine that we're
generating up to a hundred action items a week.
</p>

<p>
In the past, I think a lot of it was just subject
to the whims of people's memory. They'll say, "I'm
going to do that," and then… Did they remember to
do that? Nobody's following up. Three months later, somewhere,
they'll go like, "Oh yeah we talked about that, didn't we?"
</p>

<p>
So I'm trying to now stem the the tide of lost
ideas. [My current approach] combines dynamic
blocks with <a href="https://www.orgroam.com/">org-roam</a> templates to make new files
for every meeting and it combines org-review to
narrow down the candidate agendas each time
appropriately, and it combines a custom command to
show me a list of all tasks that are currently
needing review.
</p>

<p>
Reviewing isn't just about, "Is the thing done?"
It's also, "Did I tag it with the right names? Did
I delegate? Did I associate an effort quantity to
it?" (I'm using efforts now as a way to quickly
flag whether a day has become unrealistically over-full.)
</p>

<p>
I only started using <a href="https://orgmode.org/manual/Column-View.html">column view</a> very, very
recently. I've never used it before. But now that
I'm using <a href="https://orgmode.org/manual/Effort-Estimates.html">effort strings</a>, it does have some nice
features to it: the ability to see your properties
laid out in a table.

<h2 id="distinctions">John on making meaningful distinctions (semantic or operational)</h2>
<div id="text-distinctions">
<blockquote>
<p>
Today's agenda has 133 items on it. I need
ways to narrow that agenda down.
</p>

<p>
I've used a lot of different tasks management
philosophies. We're always looking for more
efficiency, and we're looking for more personal
adaptation to what works for us. I've gone
from system to system. What I'm starting to realize is
that the real value in all of these
systems is that they're different
enough from whatever you're using
today, that they will force you to
think about the system you're making
for yourself, that is their value.
</p>

<p>
That's why I think there should always be a huge
variety of such systems and people should always
be exploring them. I don't believe any one one
system can work for everybody, but we all need to
be reflecting on the systems that we use. Somebody
else showing you, "Hey, I do it this way" is a
really nice way to juxtapose whatever system
you're using.
</p>

<p>
I discovered through reading Karl Voit's articles
that there are three
principal information activities: searching, filtering, and browsing.
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Hierarchies</b> assist with browsing.</li>
<li><b>Tagging</b> assist with filtering and keywords.</li>
<li><b>Metadata</b> assist with searching.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Those are the three general ways
that we approach our data.
</p>

<p>
We have to do work to draw distinctions between
that data. The whole reason that we're drawing
distinctions between that data is to narrow our
focus to what is important.
</p>

<p>
I have over 30,000 tasks in my Org Mode
overall. 23,000 of them are TODOs. Several
thousand of them are still currently open. I'm
never gonna see them all. Even if I wanted to, I'm
never gonna see them all. I don't know what to
search for. I don't know what the query should be.
I have to use tagging and scheduling and
categorization and everything.
I believe that that is the work
of a knowledge worker is to introduce
these distinctions. That takes
time and it takes effort.
</p>

<p>
What's really important is to draw meaningful
distinctions. Make distinctions that matter.
</p>

<p>
I could tag things with like the next time I go to
Walmart, so that I could do a filtered query to
show me all things that I might want to do at
Walmart, but is that worth the effort or is just
tagging it as an errand enough? Because that list
will get within the size range that I can now
eyeball them all and mentally filter out the
ones that I need for Walmart.
</p>

<p>
What makes a meaningful distinction? I
believe there are two things that make a
distinction meaningful. One is semantic, and one
is operational.
</p>

<p>
A <b>semantic distinction</b> is a distinction that
changes the meaning of the task. If I have a task
that says "Set up Zoom account", if that's in my
personal Org Mode, that has one level of priority
and one level of focused demand. If it's in my
work list, that has a totally different importance
and a totally different focused demand. It changes
the nature of the task from one that is low
urgency (maybe a curiosity) to high urgency that
might impact many people or affect how I can get
my work done. That distinction is meaningful or
semantic. It changes the meaning of the task.
</p>

<p>
An <b>operational distinction</b> changes how I
interact with the task. [For example, if I tag a
phone call, I can] group all of my phone calls
during a certain time of the day. That changes
my nature of interaction with the task. I'm doing
it at a different time of day or doing it in
conjunction with other tasks. That helps narrow my
focus during that section of time that I have
available for making calls. It's an operational
distinction. if it's changing how you interact
with the task.
</p>

<p>
You're succeeding at all of this if on any given
day and any given time, <b>what's in front of your
eyes is what should be in front of your eyes</b>.
That's what all of this is about. If an
operational distinction is not aiding you in that
effort, it's <b>not worth doing</b>. It's not
meaningful enough to go above the bar.

<h2 id="ex-distinctions">John on examples of distinctions that weren't personally worth it</h2>
<div id="text-ex-distinctions">
<blockquote>
<p>
I'm trying to narrow and optimize down to the
minimum distinctions necessary to remain
effective. If I can ever get rid of a distinction,
I'm happy to do it.
</p>

<p>
I used to have projects and have categories,
or what <a href="https://fortelabs.com/blog/para/">PARA</a> method calls areas.
Projects are different from areas and
that they have a definition of
completion and they have a deadline,
but that's the only distinction.
I realized that distinction
doesn't do me any good because
if it has a deadline, that's the distinction, right?
</p>

<p>
Calling it an area or calling it a project… I
can just have projects without deadlines and then
that's good enough. I have a query that shows me
all projects whose deadlines are coming up within
the next month, and then I'm aware of what I need
to be aware of. I don't need to make the
distinction between the ones that have and don't
have deadlines. I just need to assign a deadline
so the deadline was sufficient discrimination. I
didn't need the classification difference between
area and project.
</p>

<p>
And then [PARA's] distinction between projects,
areas, and archives. I realize that there's only
one operational benefit of an archive, and it's to
speed things up by excluding archives from the Org
ID database or from the org-roam-dbsync. That's
it. That's the only reason I would ever exclude
archives, because I want to search in archives.
org-agenda-custom-commands is already only looking
at open tasks. In a way, it's by implication
archiving anything that's done in terms of its
meaning.
</p>

<p>
This is all just an
example of me looking at the para
method and realizing that none of
their distinctions really meant something for me.
</p>

<p>
What was meaningful was:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Does it have a deadline?</li>
<li>Is it bounded or not bounded?</li>
<li>Do I want to included in the processing of items?</li>
<li>[Is it a habit?]</li>

<div id="outline-container-habits">
<h2 id="habits">John on habits</h2>
<div id="text-habits">
<blockquote>
<p>
I did decide to draw the distinction of habits. I
want them to look and feel different because I'm
trying to become more habit-heavy.
</p>

<p>
I read this really brilliant book called <a href="https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits">Atomic
Habits</a> that I think has changed my life more than
any other. I've read a lot of really good time
management books but this book far and away has
made the biggest impact on my life. One of its
philosophical points that it makes that is so
profound is that goal-oriented thinking is less
successful in the long run than behavior-oriented
thinking or habit- or system-oriented thinking.
Instead of having a goal to clean your office,
have a habit to remove some piece of clutter from
your office like each time you stand up to go get
a snack. You seek habits that in the aggregate
will achieve the goals you seek to do.
</p>

<p>
I'm trying now to shift a lot of things in my
to-do lists that were goals. I'm trying to
identify the habits that will create systems of
behavior that will naturally lead to those goals.
I want habits to be first
class citizens, and I want to be
aware of the habits I'm creating.
</p>

<p>
I think the other thing that Atomic Habits
did is it changed my conception of what a habit
is. Before, I thought of a habit as "using the
exercise bike" or something like that, which
always made it a big enough task that I would keep
pushing it off. Then I would realize I'd pushed it
off for six months and then I would unschedule it
and give up on it because it was just it would
just be glaring at me with a look of doom from my
agenda list.
</p>

<p>
What's important is the consistency,
not the impact of any one particular
accomplishing of that habit.
It's a habit.
If I do it daily, it's doesn't matter
how much of it I do.
So even if it just means I get on the
bike and I spin the pedals for three
minutes, literally, that's successful
completion.
</p>

<p>
Any time you have a new habit, one of the
activities in mastering that habit is to keep
contracting the difficulty of the habit down,
down. You've got to make it so stupidly small and
simple to do, that you do it just for the fun of
marking it done in the agenda, right?
</p>

<p>
I have a habit to review my vocabulary lists
for languages that I'm learning. I'm okay with one
word. As long as I ran the app and I studied
one word, that's success.
</p>

<p>
What you find happening is that you'll do the one
word, and now because you're there, because you're
in the flow of it, you're like, "I'll do two. You know, I'm already here.
What's the big difficulty in doing
two?"
</p>

<p>
So you make the success bar super
low. You're trying to almost
trick yourself into getting into the
flow of whatever that activity is.
</p>

<p>
[org-habit org-ql list] So I have all of these
habits here, and every single habit on this list
is super easy to do. Five minutes is all that it
would take, or even one minute for most of them. I
use different little icons to group them. It also
keeps the title of the habit really small. I found
that when the titles were really long. I didn't
like reading it all the time. It just was a wall
of text. When it's these one word plus an icon, it
just kind of jumps out.

being a hamster on a hamster wheel.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, one of the timers is called flywheel
mode. The idea is: just do a little bit. Like, if
I'm just having a mental block, I can't stand working
on that test today, I'm going to do five minutes.
I can spend five minutes doing whatever. Next
time, we do 10 minutes in 15. Pretty soon, I'm
doing 45 minutes at a stretch. Maybe when I sit
down to do 5, I'll actually do 15. I'm just slowly building up that
mental momentum. I'll allow myself to quit after
5 minutes, but I end up doing 20.

<p>
Momentum is key. There's a flip side to this whole
concept of the value of iterative improvement. The
opposite remains also true.
</p>

<p>
<b>Consistent good is your best ally, and inconsistent bad is also your ally.</b> It's when the
reverse is true that you have inconsistent good
and consistent bad, that's what leads you into
roads of doom.
</p>

<p>
That never occurred to me before. I would always
be one of those people who would set myself up
with a goal, like, I want to lose 20 pounds. I
would struggle to achieve it. I would be dismayed
because of how hard it was to get there, and then
you'd have a day when you're like, you get off the
wagon and you're like, The game is lost. And then
and then you can't get back on again. Whereas now
it's like that wagon, it's not so easy to get off
of. I have to really make a concerted effort to be
consistently bad in order to make things horrible
again.
</p>

<p>
I almost want to change org-habit to have a
different kind of visualization, because streaks
are not motivators for me. Streaks punish you for
losing one day out of 200, right? I don't want a
graph that shows me streaks. I want a graph that
shows me consistency. If I have 200 days and I've
missed five of them, I'm super consistent. Maybe I
could do this with colors. Just show a bar with
that color, and don't show individual asterisks to
show when I did it or when I didn't do it, because
I find streaks anti-motivating.

<p>
The whole principle around <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190218084858/http://llamagraphics.com/products/life-balance">Life Balance [by Llamagraphics]​</a> was: you take all of your tasks,
you categorize them, you associate difficulty
to them and priority and everything else. Then
it tries to use heuristics to determine if
your life is being balanced, [and it percolates certain tasks to the top of your list].
</p>

<p>
If the system's doing a
good job, then your agenda list
should always be A-Z pretty much
the best order in which you ought to
do things.
It didn't just do category-based
balance, it also did difficulty-based
balance. You should only be
doing super hard stuff once in a while. You do a hard
thing, then you do lots of easy
things, then you do a hard thing.
</p>

<p>
Now, I'm wondering… This idea of
momentum is very similar to the idea
of balance.
"Have established momentum
with a system of behavior" is similar
to "Have an established balance with
all of the tasks that I do related to
different activities."
Is there a data architecture that would allow me to do both of
these things.
</p>

<p>
The whole idea of making the habits be colors and
then sorting them according to the spectrum is
literally just to achieve balance among how much
attention I'm paying to different habits.

<p>
My fundamental system right now is
there's like two <a href="https://github.com/alphapapa/org-ql">org-ql</a> views.
There's the view of tasks that are
scheduled for today or have a
deadline of today,
and then there's a view of tasks that
I've decided that they
need to be done, but I haven't
decided when to do them yet.
</p>

<p>
[Top list]: I just pick the next task off the list
or reschedule if it's not important enough now.
But then when that's empty, if it ever gets that
way, it's the second view. I decide, okay, there's
something I need to do. I can do that on Tuesday.
Then it disappears until I need to think about it
again.
</p>

<p>
This separates deciding what to do from when to
do. Then I can just switch into my own manager
mode for a moment, and then switch into "just put
your head down and do the work mode."
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
[More details]
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The top view is basically tasks that have a
deadline, that are relevant to now (either
deadline today or in the past), or it's an item
that I've scheduled to work on today or in the
past.
</p>

<p>
The view below, that is items that have no
planning date. I need to give them one, or maybe
they can just sit in that list of projects that
have no next task. I use a project heading to
[note] something that needs to be subdivided if I
don't have a next task for it, then that'll show
up there to remind me to give it one. Once it has
a next task, [that] task would appear instead of
the project heading until I schedule it. Anything
I've forgotten to schedule yet will show up in
that list.
</p>

<p>
Below that I just have
a small window that shows me things.
I've completed or clocked in the past
week.
</p>

<p>
And then, another small window shows me anything
that's a project status so I can get an overview.
</p>

<p>
In the work file itself, I have a number of links
to org-ql views, like "Show me all my top level
projects," "Show me tasks I need to talk to my
boss about" or somebody else.

<blockquote>
<p>
Org Mode is really a database, right?
It's a database of of highly
structured data that has a lot of
associated metadata.
</p>

<p>
The value of that data requires a certain
level of consistency which is work that we have to
do. In the same way we do work drawing
distinctions, we need to do work to keep that data
consistent. Am I using this [property]? Am I using
this tag to mean the right thing or whatever? Karl
Voit says that one of the most valuable things if
you're going to use tagging to organize your data
is a constrained tag vocabulary. Make a fixed
list. Then it's an error if you tag something and
it's not in that list, because you either need to
expand the list or you need to choose a better
tag. That's really valuable.
</p>

<p>
Even though I use <a href="https://orgmode.org/manual/Org-Syntax.html">org-lint</a> on all my org files, I
found serious data errors. [The newline before an
initial star had been lost], and then Org wouldn't
see the entry. I never knew that it wasn't even
being a participant in any of my queries. I just didn't know stuff like that.
</p>

<p>
I created a whole bunch of Haskell libraries that
allow me to <a href="https://github.com/jwiegley/org-jw">parse Org Mode data</a>. It's a very
opinionated parser. It's a very strict parser. It
will not parse data files that do not have the
exact shape and text and taxonomy that I want.
</p>

<p>
I wrote a <a href="https://github.com/jwiegley/org-jw/blob/main/org-lint/src/Org/Lint.hs">linting module</a> that basically encodes
every single rule that I have ever wanted to apply
to my data. Like, in the title of an Org Mode
heading. I don't want two spaces. I don't want
extra excess white space. That should be a rule
right?
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
[Multiple examples, including when a file had TODO
entries but didn't have a TODO filetag.]
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
My linter makes sure that this rule is
consistently maintained. Being able to have an
aggressive, thorough, universal consistency
throughout all of my org data has really put my
mind at ease. I can't break my data because I just
won't be able to commit the broken data into git.
I find myself adding new linting rules on a weekly
basis. The more that I add, the more value my data
has, because the more regular it is, the more
normal, the more searchable.

Maybe I'll try <a href="https://github.com/iSoron/uhabits/discussions/689">Loop Habits</a>, which can export to CSV.</li>
<li>A custom consistency checker might be good to
make for things like tags, or at least an
interactive function that prompts me to choose
from a controlled vocabulary.</li>
