<p>Postgres continues to hold its position as one of the most popular developer databases ever created. While MySQL lost some of its luster after acquisition by Oracle, Postgres continues to win more developer trust. In 2023, it <a href="https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/#section-most-popular-technologies-databases">topped the poll</a> in the StackOverflow Developers Survey and in the same year, was voted the <a href="https://db-engines.com/en/blog_post/106">DBMS of the Year</a> by DBEngines. The current internet meme is “Just Use Postgres” for everything.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite popularity Postgres suffers from the two problems that beset nearly all relational databases. It is difficult to scale up and down without interruption. Worse, it takes a long time to restore production operations when software bugs affect the data.</p>



<p>This happens because with Postgres it’s hard to create a high-fidelity developer environment as it requires copying the full state of the database. With that, maintaining multiple copies of data and schema for every developer is a major pain in the neck. The database becomes the nexus of development for most teams and invariably is the bottleneck constricting developer velocity.</p>







<p>When the Neon engineering team approached these issues they knew they had to solve several problems with today’s database development lifecycle:</p>



<ol>
<li>They wanted Postgres cluster creation to be fast (sub-second)</li>



<li>They wanted Postgres clusters to be able to scale up and down automatically as the load changed. You don’t need to worry about over or under provisioning.</li>



<li>They wanted to be able to create branches with full data copied instantly so developers could work independently while still being able to collaborate effectively</li>



<li>They wanted to restore to a point in time in seconds instead of hours or days</li>
</ol>



<p>Almost every app needs a database, and while developer tools and workflows evolved with platforms like GitHub and Vercel, databases did not evolve to match the developer experience of these systems.&nbsp; Evolving developer experience around the database requires a fundamental rethinking of the database architecture. But this is not a “look at our cool new database” engine. We know developers love and want to use authentic open-source Postgres. So, at Neon, we looked at how we could change the experience of developing on Postgres without losing everything that makes Postgres great.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We borrowed an idea from <a href="https://www.amazon.science/publications/amazon-aurora-design-considerations-for-high-throughput-cloud-native-relational-databases">Amazon Aurora</a>, the separation of storage and compute; and we aren’t talking about simply using a network-attached disk like EBS. True separation of storage and compute opened up the possibility to scale both parts of the service independently. Unlike AWS Aurora we decided to open source all the changes in Postgres and also send them upstream as well as fully open source our cloud native storage.</p>



<p>We made <a href="https://neon.tech/blog/architecture-decisions-in-neon">architectural decisions</a> that ensured that our users have the complete Postgres experience, including Extensions, internals, command line and management tools. Everything that worked on-premise should work in our cloud service.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An additional benefit from separating storage and compute is – well we have a brand new cloud native storage implementation and we can “do things” in it. Controlling storage allows us to implement branching – a flagship feature that unlocks a better developer experience for building database apps.</p>







<p>This means we can create branches at any point in time and start a compute instance pointing to that database version. So, every developer can work on a different branch without colliding with their colleague’s work.&nbsp;</p>

Even large database loads have peaks and troughs. We wanted to avoid&nbsp; developers having to size for the largest expected load.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A database branch is copy-on-write, so it only points to a set of already created and stored pages. So, branches take less than a second to create. Because they are copied on write branches incur no space overhead until data is written to them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Suppose a developer fat fingers a table or a database out of existence? No problem, move the branch to the second before that event happened. Starting a new database or recovering from a production failure happens in seconds because the Neon architecture doesn’t require you to ship hundreds of gigabytes of data to create new instances of databases and servers.</p>



<p>Users don’t want databases, they want data. Neon is designed to take the overhead of starting, stopping, creating, and cloning databases from hours to seconds. The major velocity inhibitor of modern development is the relational database. Imagine if data was easy, what would it do to your developer productivity?&nbsp;</p>



<p>With Neon database branching is integrated directly into the developer workflow and without interruption. When database data and/or schema changes take hours to propagate across the development team everyone suffers.<br></p>



<p>Neon is the next big pivot for Postgres, and all of these changes have been offered upstream to the Postgres community. They are available in our <a href="https://github.com/neondatabase/neon">public repo</a> today. Our mission is to provide everything Postgres developers need and less. Less waiting for clusters to start, less waiting for databases to restore, less waiting for colleagues changes to deploy, less waiting for the DBA team to schedule their updates.</p>







<p>During our Preview we’ve been focused on building a solid technical foundation for Neon. Some of our favorite milestones:</p>



<ul>
<li>In December 2022, <a href="https://neon.tech/blog/neon-serverless-postgres-is-live"><strong>we removed the invite-only gate to Neon</strong></a><strong>. </strong>Today, thousands of new Neon databases are created weekly. Neon includes a generous free tier that is here to stay:<a href="https://twitter.com/nikitabase/status/1758639571414446415"> the Neon architecture makes it efficient for us to support it.</a>&nbsp;</li>



<li>We made <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1ZEY3W7sOI"><strong>database</strong> <strong>branching</strong></a> available to everyone. Today, tens of thousands of branches are created weekly by Neon users<strong>. </strong>Neon branches include data and schema, allowing developers to create isolated copies of their data in 1 second.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Neon also included <a href="https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api"><strong>API support</strong></a> right from the start. The Neon API has now matured into a robust tool that enables Neon partners to easily manage fleets of hundreds of thousands of databases. They automate all database operations via the API, removing the need for dedicated DevOps for managing Postgres fleets.&nbsp;</li>



<li>We also released a <a href="https://neon.tech/blog/serverless-driver-for-postgres"><strong>serverless driver</strong></a>. Today, the Neon serverless driver has +100,000 weekly downloads. Developers use it to speed up their JavaScript and Typescript deployments.&nbsp;</li>



<li>On the topic of speeding up deployments, we launched our <a href="https://neon.tech/docs/guides/vercel"><strong>Vercel integration</strong></a>, which creates one database branch for every preview. Today, thousands of Neon database branches have been created via the Vercel integration.&nbsp;</li>



<li>A few months into our Preview, we released the first version of <a href="https://neon.tech/blog/scaling-serverless-postgres"><strong>autoscaling</strong></a>, a foundational feature that expands the Neon serverless experience. Today, thousands of autoscaling events are happening every week, saving developers the work of resizing manually.<strong> </strong></li>



<li>We also made the <a href="https://neon.tech/blog/cli"><strong>Neon CLI</strong></a> available to all users, so developers could simplify their integrations and automations by managing Neon directly from their terminal. Today, our CLI has hundreds of weekly active users (and counting).&nbsp;</li>



<li>During the months of Preview, we put a special focus on improving our <a href="https://neon.tech/blog/why-you-want-a-database-that-scales-to-zero"><strong>scale to zero</strong> <strong>and cold start</strong></a><strong> </strong>behavior. Today, tens of thousands of Neon databases scale to zero every day, saving developers money. And we keep working hard on our cold start metrics: <a href="https://neon-cold-start-benchmarks.vercel.app/#benchmark-methodology"><strong>we are now at a P50 of 500 ms to start a database</strong></a>, and we’re working to reduce it further.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>







<p>Neon Postgres is Generally Available. Serverless autoscaling and instant branching are built for modern developers who have to iterate fast. Go faster with Neon, it’s ready, <a href="https://console.neon.tech/signup">give it a spin</a>.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
<!--X-Body-of-Message-->
<pre>Hello,

Given the recent spread of the "AI" bubble, I think we really need to
look into formally addressing the related concerns.  In my opinion,
at this point the only reasonable course of action would be to safely
ban "AI"-backed contribution entirely.  In other words, explicitly
forbid people from using ChatGPT, Bard, GitHub Copilot, and so on, to
create ebuilds, code, documentation, messages, bug reports and so on for
use in Gentoo.</pre><pre>
Just to be clear, I'm talking about our "original" content.  We can't do
much about upstream projects using it.


Rationale:

1. Copyright concerns.  At this point, the copyright situation around
generated content is still unclear.  What's pretty clear is that pretty
much all LLMs are trained on huge corpora of copyrighted material, and
all fancy "AI" companies don't give shit about copyright violations.
In particular, there's a good risk that these tools would yield stuff we
can't legally use.

2. Quality concerns.  LLMs are really great at generating plausibly
looking bullshit.  I suppose they can provide good assistance if you are
careful enough, but we can't really rely on all our contributors being
aware of the risks.

3. Ethical concerns.  As pointed out above, the "AI" corporations don't
give shit about copyright, and don't give shit about people.  The AI
bubble is causing huge energy waste.  It is giving a great excuse for
layoffs and increasing exploitation of IT workers.  It is driving
enshittification of the Internet, it is empowering all kinds of spam
and scam.


Gentoo has always stood out as something different, something that
worked for people for whom mainstream distros were lacking.  I think
adding "made by real people" to the list of our advantages would be
a good thing — but we need to have policies in place, to make sure shit
doesn't flow in.

Compare with the shitstorm at:

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>This 3-mm PCSEL is packaged and ready to fire.</p><div data-headline="The Tiny Ultrabright Laser that Can Melt Steel" data-elid="2667720149" data-post-url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/pcsel" data-authors="Susumu Noda, Masahiro Yoshida, Takuya Inoue" data-page-title="The Tiny Ultrabright Laser that Can Melt Steel - IEEE Spectrum"><p><strong>In 2016, the Japanese</strong> government announced a plan for the emergence of a new kind of society. Human civilization, the proposal explained, had begun with hunter-gatherers, passed through the agrarian and industrial stages, and was fast approaching the end of the information age. As then Prime Minister Shinzo Abe put it, “We are now witnessing the opening of the fifth chapter.”
</p><p>
	This chapter, called 
	<a href="https://www8.cao.go.jp/cstp/english/society5_0/index.html" target="_blank">Society 5.0</a>, would see made-on-demand goods and robot <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/stretch-assistive-robot" target="_self">caretakers</a>, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/autonomous-vehicles" target="_self">taxis</a>, and tractors. Many of the innovations that will enable it, like <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/topic/artificial-intelligence/" target="_self">artificial intelligence</a>, might be obvious. But there is one key technology that is easy to overlook: <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/lasers" target="_self">lasers</a>.
</p><p>
	The lasers of Society 5.0 will need to meet several criteria. They must be small enough to fit inside everyday devices. They must be low-cost so that the average metalworker or car buyer can afford them—which means they must also be simple to manufacture and use energy efficiently. And because this dawning era will be about mass customization (rather than mass production), they must be highly controllable and adaptive.
</p><p>
	Semiconductor lasers would seem the perfect candidates, except for one fatal flaw: They are much too dim. Laser brightness—defined as optical power per unit area per unit of solid angle—is a measure of how intensely light can be focused as it exits the laser and how narrowly it diverges as it moves away. The threshold for materials work—cutting, welding, drilling—is on the order of 1 gigawatt per square centimeter per steradian (GW/cm<sup>2</sup>/sr). However, the brightness of even the brightest commercial semiconductor lasers falls far below that.
</p><p>
	Brightness is also important for light detection and ranging (lidar) systems in autonomous robots and vehicles. These systems don’t require metal-melting power, but to make precise measurements from long distances or at high speeds, they do require tightly focused beams. Today’s top-line lidar systems employ more than 100 semiconductor lasers whose inherently divergent beams are collimated using a complicated setup of lenses installed by hand. This complexity drives up cost, putting lidar-navigated cars out of reach for most consumers.
</p><p><img alt="An image of circle and squares on a gold background. " data-rm-shortcode-id="9b3aa53d0e32071d5ad9ead0354eeaf7" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/an-image-of-circle-and-squares-on-a-gold-background.jpg?id=51959582&amp;width=980" height="1402" id="4d3c5" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/an-image-of-circle-and-squares-on-a-gold-background.jpg?id=51959582&amp;width=980" width="2000"><small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">Multiple 3-millimeter-wide photonic-crystal semiconductor lasers are built on a semiconductor wafer. </small><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Susumu Noda</small></p><p>
	Of course, other types of lasers can produce ultrabright beams. Carbon dioxide and 
	<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/laser-weapons" target="_self">fiber lasers</a>, for instance, dominate the market for industrial applications. But compared to speck-size semiconductor lasers, they are enormous. A high-power CO<sub>2</sub> laser can be as large as a refrigerator. They are also more expensive, less energy efficient, and harder to control.
</p><p>
	Over the past couple of decades, our team at Kyoto University has been developing a new type of semiconductor laser that blows through the brightness ceiling of its conventional cousins. We call it the 
	<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/photonic-crystals" target="_self">photonic-crystal</a> surface-emitting laser, or PCSEL (pronounced “pick-cell”). <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/photonic-crystal-lasers" target="_self">Most recently</a>, we fabricated a PCSEL that can be <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06059-8" target="_blank">as bright as gas and fiber lasers</a>—bright enough to quickly slice through steel—and proposed a design for one that is 10 to 100 times as bright. Such devices could revolutionize the manufacturing and automotive industries. If we, our collaborating companies, and research groups around the world—such as at National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, in Hsinchu, Taiwan; the University of Texas at Arlington; and the University of Glasgow—can push PCSEL brightness further still, it would even open the door to exotic applications like inertial-confinement nuclear fusion and light propulsion for spaceflight.
</p><h2>Hole-y Grail </h2><p>
	The magic of PCSELs arises from their unique construction. Like any semiconductor laser, a PCSEL consists of a thin layer of light-generating material, known as the active layer, sandwiched between cladding layers. In fact, for the sake of orientation, it’s helpful to picture the device as a literal sandwich—let’s say a slice of ham between two pieces of bread.
</p><p>
	Now imagine lifting the sandwich to your mouth, as if you are about to take a bite. If your sandwich were a conventional semiconductor laser, its beam would radiate from the far edge, away from you. This beam is created by passing a current through a stripe in the active “ham” layer. The excited ham atoms spontaneously release photons, which stimulate the release of identical photons, amplifying the light. Mirrors on each end of the stripe then repeatedly reflect these waves; because of interference and loss, only certain frequencies and spatial patterns—or modes—are sustained. When the gain of a mode exceeds losses, the light emerges in a coherent beam, and the laser is said to oscillate in that mode.
</p><p>
	The problem with this standard stripe approach is that it is very difficult to increase output power without sacrificing beam quality. The power of a semiconductor laser is limited by its emission area because extremely concentrated light can cause catastrophic damage to the semiconductor. You can deliver more power by widening the stripe, which is the strategy used for so-called broad-area lasers. But a wider stripe also gives room for the oscillating light to take zigzag sideways paths, forming what are called higher-order lateral modes.
</p><div id="rebelltitem2" data-id="2" data-reload-ads="false" data-is-image="False" data-href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/pcsel/particle-2" data-basename="particle-2" data-post-id="2667720149" data-published-at="1712754271" data-use-pagination="False"><p>You can visualize the intesity pattern of a lateral mode by imagining that you’ve placed a screen in the cross section of the output beam. Light bouncing back and forth perfectly along the length of the stripe forms the fundamental (zero-order) mode, which has a single peak of intensity in the center of the beam. The first-order mode, from light reflecting at an angle to the edge of the sandwich, has two peaks to the right and left; the second-order mode, from a smaller angle, has a row of three peaks, and so on. For each higher-order mode, the laser effectively operates as a combination of smaller emitters whose narrower apertures cause the beam to diverge rapidly. The resulting mixture of lateral modes therefore makes the laser light spotty and diffuse.</p><p>Those troublesome modes are why the brightness of conventional semiconductor lasers maxes out around 100 MW/cm<sup>2</sup>/sr. PCSELs deal with unwanted modes by adding another layer inside the sandwich: the “Swiss cheese” layer. This special extra layer is a semiconductor sheet stamped with a two-dimensional array of nanoscale holes. By tuning the spacing and shape of the holes, we can control the propagation of light inside the laser so that it oscillates in only the fundamental mode, even when the emission area is expanded. The result is a beam that can be <em>both</em> powerful and narrow—that is, bright.</p><p>Because of their internal physics, PCSELs operate in a completely different way from edge-emitting lasers. Instead of pointing away from you, for instance, the beam from your PCSEL sandwich would now radiate upward, through the top slice of bread. To explain this unusual emission, and why PCSELs can be orders of magnitude brighter than other semiconductor lasers, we must first describe the material properties of the Swiss cheese—in actuality, a fascinating structure called a photonic crystal.</p><h2>How Photonic Crystals Work</h2><p>Photonic crystals control the flow of light in a way that’s similar to how <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/topic/semiconductors/">semiconductors</a> control the flow of electrons. Instead of atoms, however, the lattice of a photonic crystal is sculpted out of larger entities—such as holes, cubes, or columns—arranged such that the refractive index changes periodically on the scale of a wavelength of light. Although the quest to artificially construct these marvelous materials began less than 40 years ago, scientists have since learned that they already exist in nature. Opals, peacock feathers, and some butterfly wings, for example, all owe their brilliant iridescence to the intricate play of light within naturally engineered photonic crystals.</p><p>Understanding how light moves in a photonic crystal is fundamental to PCSEL design. We can predict this behavior by studying the crystal’s photonic band structure, which is analogous to the electronic band structure of a semiconductor. One way to do that is to plot the relationship between frequency and wavenumber—the number of wave cycles that fit within one unit cell of the crystal’s lattice.</p></div><div id="rebelltitem5" data-id="5" data-reload-ads="false" data-is-image="False" data-href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/pcsel/particle-5" data-basename="particle-5" data-post-id="2667720149" data-published-at="1712778266" data-use-pagination="False"><p>Consider, for example, a simple one-dimensional photonic crystal formed by alternating ribbons of glass and air. Light entering the crystal will refract through and partially reflect off each interface, producing overlapping beams that reinforce or weaken one another according to the light’s wavelength and direction. Most waves will travel through the material. But at certain points, called singularity points, the reflections combine perfectly with the incident wave to form a standing wave, which does not propagate. In this case, a singularity occurs when a wave undergoes exactly half a cycle from one air ribbon to the next. There are other singularities wherever a unit cell is an integer multiple of half the wavelength.</p><p>One of us (Susumu Noda) began experimenting with lasers containing photonic crystal-like structures before these materials even had a name. In the mid 1980s, while at Mitsubishi Electric Corporation, he studied a semiconductor laser called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed-feedback_laser" target="_blank">distributed feedback (DFB) laser</a>. A DFB laser is a basic stripe laser with an extra internal layer containing regularly spaced grooves filled with matter of a slightly different refractive index. This periodic structure behaves somewhat like the 1D photonic crystal described above: It repeatedly reflects light at a single wavelength, as determined by the groove spacing, such that a standing wave emerges. Consequently, the laser oscillates at only that wavelength, which is critical for long-haul fiber-optic transmission and high-sensitivity optical sensing.</p></div><div id="rebelltitem7" data-id="7" data-reload-ads="false" data-is-image="False" data-href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/pcsel/particle-7" data-basename="particle-7" data-post-id="2667720149" data-published-at="1712932146" data-use-pagination="False"><p>As the Mitsubishi team demonstrated, a DFB laser can be enticed to perform other tricks. For instance, when the team set the groove spacing equal to the lasing wavelength in the device, some of the oscillating light diffracted upward, causing the laser to shine not only from the tiny front edge of its active stripe but also from the stripe’s top. However, this surface beam fanned wildly due to the narrow width of the stripe, which also made it difficult to increase the output power.</p><p>To Noda’s disappointment, his team’s attempts to widen the stripe—and therefore increase brightness—without causing other headaches were unsuccessful. Nevertheless, those early failures planted an intriguing idea: What if laser light could be controlled in <em>two</em> dimensions instead of one?</p><h2>Boosting Brightness</h2><p>Later, at Kyoto University, Noda led research into 2D and 3D photonic crystals just as the field was coming into being. In 1998, his team built the first PCSEL, and we have since honed the design for various functionalities, including high brightness.</p><p>In a basic PCSEL, the photonic-crystal layer is a 2D square lattice: Each unit cell is a square delineated by four holes. Although the band structure of a 2D photonic crystal is more complicated than that of a 1D crystal, it likewise reveals singularities where we expect standing waves to form. For our devices, we have made use of the singularity that occurs when the distance between neighboring holes is one wavelength. A gallium arsenide laser operating at 940 nanometers, for example, has an internal wavelength of around 280 nm (considering refractive index and temperature). So the holes in a basic gallium arsenide PCSEL would be set about 280 nm apart.</p><p>The operating principle is this: When waves of that length are generated in the active layer, the holes in the neighboring photonic-crystal layer act like tiny mirrors, bending the light both backward and sideways. The combined effect of multiple such diffractions creates a 2D standing wave, which is then amplified by the active layer. Some of this oscillating light also diffracts upward and downward and leaks out the laser’s top, producing a surface beam of a single wavelength.</p><p>A key reason this design works is the large refractive index contrast between the semiconductor and the air inside the holes. As Noda discovered while creating the first device, PCSELs with low refractive index contrasts, like those of DFB lasers, do not oscillate coherently. Also unlike a DFB laser, a PCSEL’s surface emission area is broad and usually round. It can therefore produce a higher quality beam with much lower divergence.</p></div><p>
	In 2014, our group reported that a PCSEL with a square lattice of triangular holes and an emission area of 200 by 200 μm could operate continuously at around 1 watt while maintaining a spotlike beam that diverged only about 2 degrees. Compared with conventional semiconductor lasers, whose beams typically diverge more than 30 degrees, this performance was remarkable. The next step was to boost optical power, for which we needed a larger device. But here we hit a snag.
	<br></p><p>
	According to our theoretical models, PCSELs using the single-lattice design could not grow larger than about 200 μm without inviting pesky higher-order lateral modes. In a PCSEL, multiple modes form when the intensity of a standing wave can be distributed in multiple ways due to the interference pattern created by repeated diffractions. In the fundamental (read: desirable) mode, the intensity distribution resembles Mount Fuji, with most of the oscillating light concentrated in the center of the lattice. Each higher-order mode, meanwhile, has two, three, four, or more Mount Fujis. So when the laser’s emission area is relatively small, the intensity peaks of the higher-order modes sit near the lattice’s periphery. Most of their light therefore leaks out of the sides of the device, preventing these modes from oscillating and contributing to the laser beam. But as with conventional lasers, enlarging the emission area makes space for more modes to oscillate.
</p><p>
	To solve that problem, we added another set of holes to the photonic-crystal layer, creating a double lattice. In our most successful version, a square lattice of circular holes is shifted a quarter wavelength from a second square lattice of elliptical holes. As a result, some of the diffracting light inside the crystal interferes destructively. These cancellations cause the intensity peaks of the lateral modes to weaken and spread. So when we expand the laser’s emission area, light from the higher-order modes still leaks heavily and does not oscillate.
</p><p>
	Using that approach, we fabricated a PCSEL with a round emission area 1 millimeter in diameter and showed it could produce a 10-W beam under continuous operation. Diverging just one-tenth of a degree, the beam was even slenderer and more collimated than its 200-μm predecessor and more than three times as bright as is possible with a conventional semiconductor laser. Our device also had the advantage of oscillating in a single mode, of course, which conventional lasers of comparable size cannot do.
</p><p>
	Pushing PCSEL brightness higher required further innovation. At larger diameters, the double-lattice approach alone does not sufficiently suppress higher-order modes, and so they oscillate yet again. We had observed, however, that these modes depart the laser slightly askew, which drew our attention to the backside reflector. (Picture a sheet of tinfoil lining the bottom of your ham and Swiss sandwich.)
</p><p><span data-rm-shortcode-id="41d28908a4e9c84be25c2d29f21a627f"><iframe frameborder="0" height="auto" type="lazy-iframe" scrolling="no" data-runner-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SFXmFNTviRI?rel=0" width="100%"></iframe></span><small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">This 50-watt PCSEL is bright enough to slice through steel.</small><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">
	Susumu Noda
	</small></p><p>
	In previous device generations, this reflector had served simply to bounce downward-diffracted light up and out from the laser’s emitting surface. By adjusting its position (as well as the spacing and shape of the photonic-crystal holes), we found we could control the reflections so that they interfere in a useful way with the 2D standing waves oscillating within the photonic-crystal layer. This interference, or coupling, essentially induces the departing waves to lose some of their energy. The more askew a departing wave, the more light is lost. And poof! No more higher-order modes.
</p><p>
	That is how, in 2023, we developed a PCSEL whose brightness of 1 GW/cm<sup>2</sup>/sr rivals that of gas and fiber lasers. With a 3-mm emission diameter, it could lase continuously at up to 50 W while sustaining a beam that diverged a minuscule one-twentieth of a degree. We even used it to cut through steel. As the bright, beautiful beam carved a disc out of a metal plate 100 μm thick, our entire lab huddled around, watching in amazement.
</p><h2>More Powerful PCSELs </h2><p>
	As impressive as the steel-slicing demonstration was, PCSELs must be even more powerful to compete in the industrial marketplace. Manufacturing automobile parts, for instance, requires optical powers on the order of kilowatts.
</p><p>
	It should be fairly straightforward to build a PCSEL that can handle that kind of power—either by assembling an array of nine 3-mm PCSELs or by expanding the emission area of our current device to 1 cm. At that size, higher-order modes would once again emerge, reducing the beam quality. But because they would still be as bright as high-power gas and fiber lasers, such kilowatt-class PCSELs could begin to usurp their bulkier competitors.
</p><p>
	To be truly game-changing, 1-cm PCSELs would need to level up by suppressing those higher-order modes. We have already devised a way to do that by fine-tuning the photonic-crystal structure and the position of the reflector. Although we have not yet tested this new recipe in the lab, our theoretical models suggest that it could raise PCSEL brightness as high as 10 to 100 GW/cm<sup>2</sup>/sr. Just imagine the variety of unique and intricate products that could be made when such concentrated light can be wielded from a tiny package.
</p><p>
	Especially for those high-power applications, we’ll need to improve the laser’s energy efficiency and thermal management. Even without any optimization, the “wall plug” efficiency of PCSELs is already at 30 to 40 percent, exceeding most carbon-dioxide and fiber lasers. What’s more, we’ve found a path we think could lead to 60 percent efficiency. And as for thermal management, the water-cooling technology we’re using in the lab today should be sufficient for a 1,000-W, 1-cm PCSEL.
</p><p>
	High-brightness PCSELs could also be used to make smaller and more affordable sensor systems for self-driving cars and robots. Recently, we built a lidar system using a 500-μm PCSEL. Under pulsed operation, we ran it at about 20 W and got a terrifically bright beam. Even at 30 meters, the spot size was only 5 cm. Such high resolution is unheard of for a compact lidar system without external lenses. We then mounted our prototypes—which are roughly the size of a webcam—on robotic carts and programmed them to follow us and one another around the engineering building.
</p><p>
	In a separate line of work, we have shown that PCSELs can emit multiple beams that can be controlled electronically to point in different directions. This on-chip beam steering is achieved by varying the position and size of the holes in the photonic-crystal layer. Ultimately, it could replace mechanical beam steering in lidar systems. If light detectors were also integrated on the same chip, these all-electronic navigation systems would be seriously miniature and low-cost.
</p><p>
	Although it will be challenging, we eventually hope to make 3-cm lasers with output powers exceeding 10 kilowatts and beams shining up to 1,000 GW/cm<sup>2</sup>/sr—brighter than any laser that exists today. At such extreme brightness, PCSELs could replace the huge, electricity-hungry CO<sub>2</sub> lasers used to generate plasma pulses for extreme ultraviolet lithography machines, making chip manufacturing much more efficient. They could similarly advance efforts to realize nuclear fusion, a process that involves firing trillions of watts of laser power at a pea-size fuel capsule. Exceptionally bright lasers also raise the possibility of light propulsion for spaceflight. Instead of taking thousands of years to reach faraway stars, a probe boosted by light could make the journey in only a few decades.
</p><p>
	It may be a cliché, but we cannot think of a more apt prediction for the next chapter of human ingenuity: The future, as they say, is bright.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
        <p>Over the last few months, I have used <a href="https://orgmode.org/">org-mode</a> more and more for writing and programming in Emacs. I love its flexibility and power, and it is the first <a href="http://www.howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/literate-programming-tutorial.html">literate programming</a> tool which “feels right”, and I have been able to stick with it for a longer period of time than in my previous attempts.</p>
<p>Recently I started thinking about how I could make my editing environment more visually appealing. I am in general very happy with my Emacs' appearance. I use the <del><a href="https://github.com/Greduan/emacs-theme-gruvbox">Gruvbox theme</a></del> (in the meantime I have switched to the light <a href="https://github.com/nashamri/spacemacs-theme">Spacemacs theme</a>) and org-mode has very decent syntax highlighting. But as I write more and more prose in Emacs these days, I started thinking it might be nice to edit text in more visually-appealing fonts, including using a proportional font, which makes regular prose much more readable. I would like to share with you what I learned and my current Emacs configuration.</p>
<p>In the end, you can have an Emacs setup for editing org documents which looks very nice, with proportional fonts for text and monospaced fonts for code blocks, examples and other elements. To wet your appetite, here is what a fragment of my <a href="https://github.com/zzamboni/dot-emacs/blob/master/init.org">init.org</a> file looked like with the Gruvbox theme:</p>
<figure><a href="https://zzamboni.org/post/beautifying-org-mode-in-emacs/images/emacs-init-propfonts.png"><img src="https://zzamboni.org/post/beautifying-org-mode-in-emacs/images/emacs-init-propfonts.png"></a>
</figure>

<p>And this is how it looks now with the light Spacemacs theme:</p>

<h2 id="step-1-configure-faces-for-org-headlines-and-lists">Step 1: Configure faces for Org headlines and lists</h2>
<p>My first step was to make  org-mode much more readable by using different fonts for headings, hiding some of the markup, and improving list bullets. I took these settings originally from Howard Abrams' excellent <a href="http://www.howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/orgmode-wordprocessor.html">Org as a Word Processor</a> article, although I have tweaked them a bit.</p>
<p>First, we ask org-mode to hide the emphasis markup (e.g. <code>/.../</code> for italics, <code>*...*</code> for bold, etc.):</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="emacs-lisp">  <span>(</span><span>setq</span> <span>org-hide-emphasis-markers</span> <span>t</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Then, we set up a font-lock substitution for list markers (I always use “<code>-</code>” for lists, but you can change this if you want) by replacing them with a centered-dot character:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="emacs-lisp">  <span>(</span><span>font-lock-add-keywords</span> <span>'org-mode</span>
                          <span>'</span><span>((</span><span>"^ *\\([-]\\) "</span>

</code></pre></div><p>The <code>org-bullets</code> package replaces all headline markers with different Unicode bullets:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="emacs-lisp">  <span>(</span><span>use-package</span> <span>org-bullets</span>
    <span>:config</span>
    <span>(</span><span>add-hook</span> <span>'org-mode-hook</span> <span>(</span><span>lambda</span> <span>()</span> <span>(</span><span>org-bullets-mode</span> <span>1</span><span>))))</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Finally, we set up a nice proportional font, in different sizes, for the headlines. The fonts listed will be tried in sequence, and the first one found will be used. My current favorite is <a href="https://edwardtufte.github.io/et-book/">ET Book</a>, feel free to add your own:</p>

</code></pre></div><h2 id="step-2-setting-up-variable-pitch-and-fixed-pitch-faces">Step 2: Setting up <code>variable-pitch</code> and <code>fixed-pitch</code> faces</h2>
<p>My next realization was that Emacs already includes support for displaying proportional fonts with the <code>variable-pitch-mode</code> command. You can try it right now: type <kbd>M-x</kbd> <code>variable-pitch-mode</code> and your current buffer will be shown in a proportional font (you can disable it by running <code>variable-pitch-mode</code> again). On my Mac the default variable-pitch font is Helvetica. You can change the font used by configuring the <code>variable-pitch</code> face. You can do this interactively through the customize interface by typing <kbd>M-x</kbd> <code>customize-face</code> <code>variable-pitch</code>. At the moment I like <del><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source%5FSans%5FPro">Source Sans Pro</a></del> <a href="https://edwardtufte.github.io/et-book/">ET Book</a>.</p>
<p>As a counterpart to <code>variable-pitch</code>, you need to configure the <code>fixed-pitch</code> face for the text that needs to be shown in a monospaced font. My first instinct was to inherit this from my <code>default</code> face (I use <del><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inconsolata">Inconsolata</a></del> <a href="https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode">Fira Code</a>), but it seems that this gets remapped when <code>variable-pitch-mode</code> is active, so I had to configure it by hand with the same font as my <code>default</code> face.</p>
<p>What I would suggest is that you customize the fonts interactively, as you can see live how it looks on your text. You can make the configuration permanent from the customize screen as well. If you want to explicitly set them in your configuration file, you can do it with the <code>custom-theme-set-faces</code> function, like this:</p>

</code></pre></div><p><strong>Tip #1:</strong> you can get the LISP expression for your chosen font (the part that looks like <code>((t (:family ... )))</code> from the <code>customize-face</code> screen - open the “State” button and choose the “Show Lisp Expression” menu item.</p>
<p><strong>Tip #2</strong>: if you use a Mac, you can get the value to use for the <code>:family</code> attribute by looking at the “Family” attribute in the Font Book application for the font you want to use.</p>
<p>You can enable <code>variable-pitch-mode</code> automatically for org buffers by setting up a hook like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="emacs-lisp">  <span>(</span><span>add-hook</span> <span>'org-mode-hook</span> <span>'variable-pitch-mode</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div><h2 id="step-3-use-long-lines-and-visual-line-mode">Step 3: Use long lines and <code>visual-line-mode</code></h2>
<p>One thing you will notice right away with proportional fonts is that filling paragraphs no longer makes sense. This is because <code>fill-paragraph</code> works based on the number of characters in a line, but with a proportional font, characters have different widths, so a filled paragraph looks strange:</p>
<figure><a href="https://zzamboni.org/post/beautifying-org-mode-in-emacs/images/emacs-filled-paragraph.png"><img src="https://zzamboni.org/post/beautifying-org-mode-in-emacs/images/emacs-filled-paragraph.png"></a>
</figure>

<p>Of course, you can still do it, but there’s a better way. With <code>visual-line-mode</code> enabled, long lines will flow and adjust to the width of the window. This is great for writing prose, because you can choose how wide your lines are by just resizing your window.</p>
<figure><a href="https://zzamboni.org/post/beautifying-org-mode-in-emacs/images/emacs-narrow-window.png"><img src="https://zzamboni.org/post/beautifying-org-mode-in-emacs/images/emacs-narrow-window.png"></a>

</figure>

<p>There is one habit you have to change for this to work: the instinct (at least for me) of pressing <kbd>M-q</kbd> every once in a while to readjust the current paragraph. I personally think it’s worth it.</p>
<p>You can enable <code>visual-line-mode</code> automatically for org buffers by setting up another hook:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="emacs-lisp">  <span>(</span><span>add-hook</span> <span>'org-mode-hook</span> <span>'visual-line-mode</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div><h2 id="step-4-configure-faces-for-specific-org-elements">Step 4: Configure faces for specific Org elements</h2>
<p>After all the changes above, you will have nice, proportional fonts in your Org buffers. However, there are some things for which you still want monospace fonts! Things like source blocks, examples, tags and some other markup elements still look better in a fixed-spacing font, in my opinion. Fortunately, org-mode has an extremely granular face selection, so you can easily customize them to have different elements shown in the correct font, color, and size.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> you can use <kbd>C-u</kbd> <kbd>C-x</kbd> <kbd>=</kbd> (which runs the command <code>what-cursor-position</code> with a prefix argument) to show information about the character under the cursor, including the face which is being used for it. If you find a markup element which is not correctly configured, you can use this to know which face you have to customize.</p>
<p>You can configure specific faces any way you want, but if you simply want them to be rendered in monospace font, you can set them to inherit from the <code>fixed-pitch</code> face we configured before. You can also inherit from multiple faces to combine their attributes.</p>
<p>Here are the faces I have configured so far (there are probably many more to do, but I don’t use org-mode to its full capacity yet). I’m showing here the LISP expressions, but you can just as well configure them using <code>customize-face</code>.</p>

</code></pre></div><p><strong>Update (2019/10/24):</strong> updated the settings above based on my latest config.
<strong>Update (2019/02/24):</strong> thanks to Ben for figuring out the fix to the vertical spacing issue noted below. The trick is to set the <code>org-indent</code> face (see above) to inherit from <code>fixed-pitch</code> as well.</p>
<p><del>One minor issue I have noticed is that, in <code>variable-pitch-mode</code>, the fixed-pitch blocks have a slight increase in inter-line spacing. This is not a deal breaker for me, but it is a noticeable difference. This can be observed in the following screenshot, which shows the block of code above embedded in the org-mode buffer and in the block-editing buffer, which uses the fixed-width font. If you know a way in which this could be fixed, please let me know!</del></p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The setup described above has considerably improved my enjoyment of writing in Emacs. I hope you find it useful. If you have any feedback, suggestions or questions, please let me know in the comments.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Obstructive sleep apnea can cause or contribute to high blood pressure, so a new study examined which sleep apnea treatments – a CPAP machine or a mouthguard that keeps the airways open – was more effective at lowering blood pressure.</p><p>Medications are the first-line treatment for high blood pressure, otherwise known as hypertension. However, <a href="https://newatlas.com/medical/nasal-spray-sleep-apnea/" data-cms-ai="0">obstructive sleep apnea</a> (OSA), which can cause and/or exacerbate <a href="https://newatlas.com/medical/new-drug-two-for-one-treatment-heart-failure-sleep-apnea/" data-cms-ai="0">hypertension</a>, is being recognized as an underdiagnosed and modifiable risk factor. The most common sleep-rated breathing disorder, OSA is caused by the collapse of the upper airway during sleep, which leads to frequent sleep interruptions, up to 30 times an hour, all night long.</p><p>Continuous positive airway pressure (<a href="https://newatlas.com/medical/health-benefits-cpap-acid-reflux/" data-cms-ai="0">CPAP</a>) delivered via a face or nasal mask is often used to treat OSA. An alternative treatment is a mandibular advancement device or MAD. Similar to a bite guard, a MAD holds the lower jaw (mandible) and tongue forward, keeping the airway open. There are pros and cons for both. CPAP, while effective, tends to be uncomfortable, so it’s poorly tolerated. MADs are less intrusive, but studies have shown they’re outperformed by CPAP when it comes to the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), the number of times airflow fully (apnea) or partially (hypopnea) stops per hour during sleep.</p><div data-align-center="">

            </div><p>Researchers from the National University of Singapore (NUS) and the University of Sydney conducted a randomized controlled trial to compare the effectiveness of MAD and CPAP in reducing hypertension in patients with moderate-to-severe OSA.</p><p>“Looking at the totality of evidence available in all the literature, it is still reasonable to say that CPAP is the first-line treatment until we have more data on the MAD,” said Ronald Lee Chi-Hang, professor of medicine at NUS’ Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine and corresponding author of the study. “However, for patients who cannot truly tolerate or accept using a CPAP, we should be more open-minded in looking for an alternative therapy such as a MAD, which, based on our study, numerically had a better blood pressure reduction in patients compared with a CPAP.”</p><p>Being a non-inferiority trial, the study tested whether a new treatment (MAD) is not worse than an established one (CPAP). The researchers recruited 220 participants with moderate-to-severe OSA and randomized them to either CPAP or MAD. Of the participants, 44.5% were overweight, and 49.5% were obese. The most prevalent high cardiovascular risk factors were coronary artery disease (60.9%) and diabetes (59.1%), with 44.1% of participants having had hypertension for more than 10 years.</p><p>At baseline and six-month follow-up, both groups underwent 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring, completed a questionnaire on sleepiness, and had blood tests for cardiovascular markers. Both devices tracked use. The primary outcome was the difference in 24-hour mean BP between baseline and follow-up.</p><p>MADs significantly reduced 24-hour mean BP from baseline to six-month follow-up, which was not significant in the CPAP group. The decrease in the MAD group was, on average, 1.64 mmHg larger than the CPAP group. Compared to the CPAP group, the MAD group also showed a larger between-group reduction in all ambulatory BP measures, especially nighttime BP, and more participants achieved a systolic BP (the top number) below 120 mmHg. None of the participants experienced symptomatic low BP or hypotension. From these data, the researchers ascertained that a MAD was non-inferior to CPAP.</p><div data-align-center="">

  <blockquote>
<p>I’m sharing this to give some background on my recent artworks exploring light, color, and perception through spectral ray tracing. This ray tracer that I’ve written has shown up in a few of my series, and I wanted to explain what “spectral ray tracing” even is. I have shared some outputs at the <a href="#spectral-ray-tracing-and-computer-art">end of this writeup</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In computer art, the artist builds both a scene and a camera to capture it out of code. The system being visualized, and process to render it into an array of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_spaces">RGB</a> values are both made of the same 1s and 0s, pure abstraction turned into light. In much the same way, our eyes and brains are made of the same <em>stuff</em> as the universe they exist within and observe. This self-referential perspective on our awareness is both eerie and profound, obvious yet unsettling.</p>
<p>For this reason, this idea of building cameras out of code has stuck with me. Now there are countless ways to do so, but one very literal and well-known process is “ray tracing”. In its essence, ray tracing models the path light travels between a simulated camera and light source, bouncing rays between virtual objects in to “illuminate” the scene.</p>
<h2 id="ray-tracing">Ray Tracing</h2>
<p>Ray tracing takes many shortcuts in the process to render an image in the name of performance. For example: ray tracing traverses the path from the light source to the camera in reverse (though there are exceptions), with the idea being that the vast majority of rays emitted from the light source never make it to the camera. By instead starting the ray at the camera’s perspective and traveling backwards, we know that the ray already “made it” to the camera. This is physically sound under our current model of the universe, as we assume the laws governing light transport are symmetric with respect to the direction of time (a.k.a. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-symmetry">T-symmetry</a>).</p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/83/Ray_trace_diagram.svg" alt="Diagram showing ray tracing on a simple scene">
  <figcaption>A simple scene being rendered via ray tracing. Each "pixel" on the left-hand grid has its color determined by the object it intersects in the scene, and how much light that object receives from the light source. Source: <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ray_trace_diagram.svg">wikimedia</a></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Another major shortcut that’s typically taken, but is far less physically sound, involves treating each light ray as a particle carrying the RGB vector corresponding to its “color”, ignoring any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave%E2%80%93particle_duality">wave-like properties light has</a>. Rather remarkably, this shortcut produces physically-realistic scenes in a wide range of scenarios. The reason why this works so well has quite a long explanation, but is in large part due to how our eyes work: simply put, we have three types of color-sensitive cells in our eyes, sensitive to short (blue), medium (green), and long (red) wavelengths of light.</p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1e/Cones_SMJ2_E.svg" alt="Diagram showing cone cell sensitivies">
  <figcaption>This diagram shows the sensitivity of the SML (short, medium, long) cone cells as a function of light's wavelength. The color we see is a result of how much the incoming light stimulates each of those cone cells. Source: <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Cones_SMJ2_E.svg">wikimedia</a></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>However, our eyes don’t just receive red, green, and blue light (unless they’re very close to a computer screen or wearing a VR headset); our eyes are receiving a continuous spectrum of light, and converting that into the perception of color.</p>
<h2 id="seeing-the-spectrum">Seeing the Spectrum</h2>
<figure>
  <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d9/Linear_visible_spectrum.svg" alt="Diagram showing the full spectrum of single-wavelength colors">
  <figcaption>The full visible spectrum of single-wavelength colors. Source: <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Linear_visible_spectrum.svg">wikimedia</a></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Color that we see in the physical world is rarely made of just a single wavelength, instead, it’s a collection of many wavelengths forming what we call an SPD (spectral power distribution). For every color we can see, there are countless spectral power distributions that could correspond to that color. The fact that a single color can have many different SPDs is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamerism_(color)">metamerism</a>, and is a fascinating concept in its own right. For example: yellow has a corresponding wavelength as seen in the above visible spectrum at around 580nm, but it can also be reproduced with a mix of red and green light (as it must be, given that the diagram itself is being rendered using only RGB values on a computer monitor).</p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/Solar_spectrum_en.svg" alt="The SPD corresponding to daylight. Wavelength is on the x-axis, and the normalized intensity is on the y-axis">
  <figcaption>The SPD for daylight, extending past the visible spectrum into ultraviolet and infrared. It's no coincidence that the intensity peaks around the part of the spectrum visible to us, as this is clearly an evolutionary adaptation to our environment. Source: <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Solar_spectrum_en.svg">wikimedia</a></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Another consequence of how our eyes see color from a distribution of wavelengths is the existence of non-spectral colors, like magenta. These colors can’t be reproduced by any single wavelength, and require multiple wavelengths of light to reproduce. Notice there is no magenta in that spectrum above, as it requires a mix of high and low-wavelength light (blue and red) to be seen.</p>
<p>What’s most remarkable about this conversion from SPD to color is that it is possible to do so purely mathematically. The fact that such a link exists, bridging physics, physiology, and our subjective experience is honestly surreal. What’s even more remarkable is that this quantitative link was made back in 1931 with the creation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIE_1931_color_space#">CIE 1931 color spaces</a>, at a time before the Turing machine (let alone a computer) was even invented, and access to electricity hadn’t even made it across America.</p>
<p>If you want to implement this conversion yourself, I recommend reading <a href="https://pbr-book.org/4ed/Radiometry,_Spectra,_and_Color/Color">this chapter of Physically Based Rendering</a>, which gives a very thorough treatment of the subject.</p>
<h2 id="when-wavelength-matters">When Wavelength Matters</h2>
<p>As mentioned above, when ray tracing it’s often unnecessary to account for the full spectrum of light, let alone each ray’s “wavelength”. However, there are cases where a ray’s wave-like properties directly influence its path through a scene, and as a result effects the colors we see. The classic example is dispersion, when the path light takes is “bent” according to its wavelength.</p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f5/Light_dispersion_conceptual_waves.gif" alt="An animation showing light being split by a triangular prism according to its wavelength">
  <figcaption>An optical prism showing white light being split into its component frequencies via dispersion. Source: <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Light_dispersion_conceptual_waves.gif">wikimedia</a></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Another fascinating example you’ve probably seen in person is called “thin film interference”, and it explains the rainbow-like patterns visible on soap bubbles. These patterns are formed by the constructive and destructive interference patterns generated by the reflections off of the upper and lower layers of the soap boundary. Since this doesn’t involve splitting the spectrum into single wavelengths, but rather increasing or decreasing the contribution of parts of the spectrum the colors generated are often non-spectral colors, like turquoises, teals, magentas, browns…</p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/55/Thin_film_interference_phase_2.svg" alt="An image showing destructive interference on a thin film boundary.">
  <figcaption>Destructive interference happening at a thin film boundary (in blue). The two incoming rays (labeled A and B) have the same wavelength, yet opposite phase after reflection due to traveling different distances before overlapping. The resulting ray (labeled C) is attenuated as a result. Source: <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Thin_film_interference_phase_2.svg">wikimedia</a></figcaption>
</figure>
<h2 id="spectral-ray-tracing-and-computer-art">Spectral Ray Tracing and Computer Art</h2>
<p>To summarize, spectral ray tracing is just ray tracing that takes into account the wave-like properties of light. Instead of viewing the world through the lens of RGB color, spectral ray tracing generates spectral power distributions for every pixel in the scene, leveraging the wavelength and phase of rays to better estimate color in scenarios where this extra information matters.</p>
<p>I’ve been curious what happens when some of the laws dictating how light moves are deliberately broken, building cameras out of code in a universe just a little unlike our own. Working with the richness of the full spectrum of light, spectral ray tracing has allowed me to break the rules governing light transport in otherworldly ways.</p>
<p>Here are a few selected outputs from the past year. All of these were generated using my hand-written, no-dependency JavaScript and GLSL spectral ray tracer.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>If you want to get to
space you climb on top of a giant fuel tank and light it on

The idea is simple. Use an airship to float on the top of the
airmosphere, then the craft slowly accelerates using electric/chemical
hybrid rocket engines over days until it reaches orbital velocity.</p><p>

The details are complicated. For one, for an airship to fly at the edge of
space it will need to be big. I mean really big, over a mile long. It
would also need to be very light, a gossomer hypersonic airship. Such a
vehicle is not suited for flight in the lower atmopshere. This and other
factors create the need to a three stage approach.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        

        

        <p>A few years ago, my cat gave me my most memorable middle of the night software
engineering incident. I was working at a startup, and we didn’t have a formal
on-call rotation yet. That was a deliberate decision, since being on-call is
painful, and the team was good about just collectively keeping an eye out for
urgent alerts. We eventually set up an on-call rotation, but before that
happened, I had a fun night.</p>
<p>Around 3 a.m., I woke up because my cat was grooming my hair. The grooming
itself wasn’t unusual. She did it occasionally, and I optimistically took it as
a sign that she actually liked me and didn’t just tolerate me. Here’s the <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Cat%20Tax">cat
tax</a>:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/DM89U2s.jpg" alt="my cat in a Fancy Feast box"></p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/jDwIABh.jpg" alt="my cat grooming my hair"></p>
<p>But in 9 years, that was the only time she did it while I was sleeping. I
checked my phone to see what time it was, and I noticed that an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/">AWS
CloudWatch</a> alert had gone off a couple
minutes ago because of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/identifying-unhealthy-targets-of-elastic-load-balancer/">unhealthy targets for our load
balancer</a>.</p>
<p>I tried to go to our website, but it didn’t load. I groaned and went to log onto
my work laptop. Our monitoring dashboard showed a massive number of requests
coming from many IP addresses that were associated with different countries. And
international traffic wasn’t typical for us anyway since our products were only
available to people in the United States. It was a <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-attack/">distributed
denial-of-service (DDoS)
attack</a>.</p>
<p>My first and not great thought was to block IP addresses at the server level,
which would have been tedious and possibly ineffective if the attacker had
significantly more source IP addresses to use. But then I remembered that we had
already set up <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/waf/">AWS Web Application Firewall</a>. To
deal with the immediate outage, I set up a rule to <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-type-geo-match.html">block requests from other
countries</a>.
It took effect and blocked hundreds of thousands of requests over the next hour
or so. Our website started working again, and the flood of requests stopped.</p>
<p>Later that morning, we noticed that we had received an email to our customer
support inbox around when the attack started. With horrible grammar, the sender
claimed to have found a vulnerability with our website that crashed
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_HTTP_Server">Apache</a>, which we didn’t even
use. They said they stopped all traffic to our website and could keep it that
way for months. They generously offered to give us a “solution file” if we sent
them $5,000 in Bitcoin. We didn’t reply, though in retrospect, it could have
been fun to try to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWzz3NeDz3E">troll them</a>.</p>
<p>I still find it hard to believe the perfect timing of my cat waking me up. You
might guess that the AWS alert caused my phone to vibrate or make a sound,
waking my cat up first. But I keep my phone in do not disturb mode during the
night. So I just like to think that somehow, she sensed something was wrong that
couldn’t wait until the morning. It was certainly a more pleasant way to be
woken up than by a blaring <a href="https://www.pagerduty.com/">PagerDuty</a> alarm.</p>

  <h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>
<p>Personal VPN services are a multi-million dollar business. But is it worth your money?</p>

<p><img src="https://httpscolonforwardslashforwardslashwwwdotzoltanbalazsdotcom.com/_img/VPN-1.png" alt="NordVPN"><br>
If they can <a href="https://www.thoughtleaders.io/blog/how-much-money-does-pewdiepie-make">afford to sponsor Pewdiepie</a>, they should do something right, right? Fifty million flies can’t be wrong!</p>

<p>This is going to be a complex topic, so bear with me.</p>

<p>The statement I would like to prove:<br>
There are only a few problems for a few people worldwide where the answer is using a personal VPN service. 
You don’t need a personal VPN service if you are an average Internet user. 
If you are a tech-savvy user, you can do much better than using a VPN.<br>
Personal VPNs are the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeopathy#Evidence_and_efficacy">homeopathic medicines</a> of the tech industry. Also known as a scam.</p>

<h2 id="glossary">Glossary</h2>
<p>By personal/commercial VPN service, I mean NordVPN, Tunnelbear, Mullvad VPN, etc. Company VPNs, or a VPN to phone into your home network, are out of the scope of this article.<br>
By public Wi-Fi, I mean Wi-Fi services where it is either open or the WPA key is shared with everyone. From a security point of view, there is not much difference between the two.</p>

<p>Let’s break down the problem of privacy and security. Let’s start with …</p>

<h2 id="security">Security</h2>
<p>Fifteen years ago, it was common malpractice that even though websites used HTTPS for the login page, the rest of the communication was over HTTP. One could steal the authentication cookie from the unencrypted Wi-Fi stream and use that to log in to that service. Tools like Surfjack and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etyCbkOKHsc">Firesheep</a> were popular tools for wannabe hackers. Back then, using a personal VPN service at public Wi-Fi made sense. Also, many email clients checked their email using unencrypted POP3 or IMAP protocols.</p>

<p>But nowadays, there <a href="https://transparencyreport.google.com/https/overview">is practically no vital service on the Internet</a>, which does not run on HTTPS.</p>

<p>OK, but what about tools like <a href="https://github.com/moxie0/sslstrip">SSLStrip?</a>
SSLStrip works like this:</p>
<ol>
  <li>User types www.mybanklogin.com</li>
  <li>The browser connects to clear-text, unprotected http://www.mybanklogin.com</li>
  <li>Attacker having active man-in-the-middle (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack">MiTM</a>) capability sees this traffic</li>
  <li>The web server notifies the user’s browser that it should use the secure https://www.mybanklogin.com site</li>
  <li>The attacker removes this notification</li>
  <li>The user continues the login process over the insecure, unencrypted http://www.mybanklogin.com</li>
</ol>

<p>So, can hackers steal my username and password? First, for accounts that matter, you should use 2FA (short for multi-factor authentication). It would be best to use unphisable 2FA like FIDO2/webauthn (e.g. Yubikey) for accounts that matter. 
Nowadays, most browsers implement <a href="https://therecord.media/eff-to-deprecate-https-everywhere-extension-as-https-is-becoming-ubiquitous">“HTTPS only mode”</a>. Next time, instead of turning on your VPN, you should check if your browser already uses HTTPS only mode, and if not, turn that on. For example, Safari does that by default.<br>
Ask your service provider to implement <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security">HSTS</a>.
It is excellent about HSTS that the user cannot bypass certificate errors. And the browser will auto-connect to HTTPS by default. 
The good news is that if you use mobile apps, almost all are secure already. Just keep your mobile OS and apps up-to-date. No one will spoil a precious <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-day_(computing)">0-day</a> to attack you. 
If you are worried about DNS MiTM, use <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/dns-over-https">DNS over HTTP</a> in your browser. 
OK, but what about tools like <a href="https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2015/07/15/the-new-metasploit-browser-autopwn-strikes-faster-and-smarter-part-1/">Metasploit browser autopwn</a>? 
Well, the good news is that it is much easier to keep your browser up-to-date compared to ~ ten years ago. Nowadays, however, it is rare that recent browser exploits are openly available for any hacker to use. If you are a target of a government, spy agency, or hacker-for-hire services, yes, they may have the resources to hack your browser, but chances are you are not that important. Sorry. And if you are that important, VPNs will not decrease your risks.</p>

<p>One massive problem with personal VPN services is that they are working to fail open. If the connection fails, your connection is not “protected” anymore. Some premium VPN providers sell “kill switch” functionality, but I am sure less than 1% of the users use this properly.</p>

<p>Looking at the practical side, how many legit stories do you know where someone lost money that could have been avoided just by using a VPN? I have never heard such a story. The “ Darkhotel “ attacker group could have been such an example, except that a VPN would not protect you against their attack, as they used fake Wi-Fi captive portals to deliver the exploit/malware. And before logging into a hotel Wi-Fi portal, you can’t start your VPN …</p>

<p>And before I forget, let’s quickly discuss free VPNs. Never, ever install a free VPN solution. They will abuse your network connectivity, and other malicious or non-malicious users will use it to do whatever they want. It is like inviting one thousand unknown people to your house to have a party and leave them unattended. You can find many stories where free VPNs are actually malware.</p>

<p>OK, but what about my DNS and TLS records being exposed to everyone so they can follow what I am doing? In a public place, anyone can look at your display already. Or, if you are worried about your ISP selling your traffic data, there are better options for you. 
Use <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/encryption/dns-over-https/encrypted-dns-browsers/">DNS over HTTPS</a>, for example. 
You have to use a VPN provider you trust better than your ISP/Wi-Fi provider.
Also, as <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/understand-encrypted-client-hello">Encrypted Client Hello</a> is about to start soon, it will be exponentially harder for eavesdroppers to figure out which sites you are trying to visit.</p>

<p>But if you care about privacy, the answer is always ToR, ToR browser or Tails, and never VPN. Except in cases where you first have to hide your ToR usage using a VPN, which is a rare exception among users. If you don’t understand why you would need that, you probably don’t need that complexity. 
Tor Browser uses uncountable techniques that prevent tracking your browser. And if your privacy is essential against local Wi-Fi attackers, your ISP, why is the ad industry not in scope? Adblockers are only half the solution against tracking.</p>

<h2 id="when-to-use-a-personal-vpn">When to use a personal VPN?</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Geofence bypass for region-locked content.</li>
  <li>Piracy. Not that you should not support your artists/musicians/content creators, filmmakers, actors, … but I agree that there are situations in life when piracy is the only ethical option.</li>
  <li>Soft network block/censorship. Do your own research. Don’t end up in jail.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Claims made by VPN companies:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>VPNs reduce the risk of “getting hacked,” whatever that means. 
This is not true. Additional services provided by VPNs, like URL filtering, can reduce your risk. However, it is more effective to use URL filtering on the endpoint level, not the network level, as most VPN companies do.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>VPNs protect your privacy<br>
Even though they increase your privacy, it is still far from what ToR can do for you.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Suppose you want to increase your privacy and security. Instead of watching VPN reviews on YouTube, I recommend that you patch your operating system and your browser and configure always HTTPS and DoH in your browser. Use an ad blocker or, even better, a <a href="https://www.privacytools.io/private-browser">browser built with privacy in mind</a>. If you frequently install new applications, use antivirus/endpoint protection on your non-mobile OS. For Windows, the built-in default Microsoft Defender is a good option. Congratulations, you are in a better position compared to using a VPN, and you don’t have to pay for it, and you don’t have to enable it all the time.</p>

<h2 id="ps">PS</h2>
<p>Yes, some of these VPN products provide extra services/functions/protections. And some of these extras make sense. But that does not mean that VPN is the answer to your problems overall.</p>

<p>WPA3 can support encryption and privacy on open, non-password-protected networks. I have not seen it anywhere in the wild, but the future is bright. If you operate open Wi-Fi networks, please, please, upgrade to WPA3.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.ralfj.de/blog/2024/04/14/bubblebox.html">https://www.ralfj.de/blog/2024/04/14/bubblebox.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40033497">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="-content">
      <header>
    
    
</header>

<p>A few years ago, I have <a href="https://www.ralfj.de/blog/2019/03/09/firejail.html">blogged</a> about my approach to sandboxing less-trusted applications that I have to or want to run on my main machine.
The approach has changed since then, so it is time for an update.</p>

<!-- MORE -->

<p>Over time I grew increasingly frustrated with Firejail: configurations would frequently break on updates,
and debugging Firejail profiles is extremely hard. When considering all the included files, we are talking
about many hundred lines of configuration with a subtle interplay of allowlists and blocklists.
Even when I knew which folder I wanted to give access to, it was often non-trivial to ensure that
this access would actually be possible.</p>

<p>Now I am instead using a combination of two different approaches: Flatpak and BubbleBox.</p>

<h2 id="flatpak">Flatpak</h2>

<p>The easiest sandbox to maintain is the sandbox maintained by someone else.
So when a Flatpak exists for software I want to or have to use, such as Signal or Zoom, that is generally my preferred approach.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Flatpaks can come with extremely liberal default profiles that make the sandbox mostly pointless.
The following global overrides help ensure that this does not happen:</p>
<div><pre><code>[Context]
sockets=!gpg-agent;!pcsc;!ssh-auth;!system-bus;!session-bus
filesystems=~/.XCompose:ro;xdg-config/fontconfig:ro;!~/.gnupg;!~/.ssh;!xdg-documents;!home;!host

[Session Bus Policy]
org.freedesktop.Flatpak=none
org.freedesktop.secrets=none
</code></pre></div>

<h2 id="bubblebox">BubbleBox</h2>

<p>However, not all software exists as Flatpak.
Also, sometimes I want software to run basically on my host system (i.e., to use the regular <code>/usr</code>), just without access to literally <em>everything</em> in my home directory.
Examples of this are Factorio and VSCodium.
The latter doesn’t work in Flatpak as I want to use it with LaTeX, and realistically this means it needs to run the LaTeX installed via <code>apt</code>.
The official recommendation is to effectively disable the Flatpak sandbox, but that entirely defeats the point, so I went looking for alternatives.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/containers/bubblewrap">bubblewrap</a> provides a very convenient solution: it can start an application in its own private filesystem namespace with full control over which part of the host file system is accessible from inside the sandbox.
I wrote a small wrapper around bubblewrap to make this configuration a bit more convenient to write and manage;
this project is called <a href="https://www.ralfj.de/projects/bubblebox">BubbleBox</a>.
This week-end I finally got around to adding support for <a href="https://github.com/flatpak/xdg-dbus-proxy">xdg-dbus-proxy</a> so that sandboxed applications can now access particular D-Bus functions without having access to the entire bus (which is in general not safe to expose to a sandboxed application).
That means it’s finally time to blog about this project, so here we go – if you are interested, check out <a href="https://www.ralfj.de/projects/bubblebox">BubbleBox</a>;
the project page explains how you can use it to set up your own sandboxing.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>I should also note that this is not the only bubblewrap-based sandboxing solution.
<a href="https://github.com/igo95862/bubblejail">bubblejail</a> is fairly similar but provides a configuration GUI and a good set of default provides;
it was a very useful resource when figuring out the right bubblewrap flags to make complex GUI applications work properly.
(Incidentally, “bubblejail” is also how I called my own script originally, but then I realized that the name is already taken.)
Joachim Breitner also recently <a href="https://www.joachim-breitner.de/blog/812-Convenient_sandboxed_development_environment">blogged</a> about his own bubblewrap-based sandboxing script.
There are many ways to do this, and it was fun to figure out my own solution.</p>

<p>Using bubblewrap and xdg-dbus-proxy for this was an absolute joy.
Both of these components came out of the Flatpak project, but the authors realized that they could be independently useful,
so in best Unix tradition they turned them into tools that provide all the required mechanism without hard-coding any sort of policy.
Despite doing highly non-trivial tasks, they are both pretty easy to use and compose and very well-documented.
Thanks a lot to everyone involved!</p>

Someone had tagged a recent photo of him grinning in a plaid shirt and had written: “Taken far too soon. RIP Paul.”</p><p id="a051">I froze. I hadn’t seen Paul in about two days. I had assumed he’d been with his friend. But not dead. Of course not dead.</p><p id="cb00">As similar messages began to flood my news feed, irrational thoughts wrestled for control of my confused brain.</p><p id="987e">I looked over at the Mexican ingredients he had stacked in our pantry. “No one buys that much salsa verde and then dies, right? Facebook is lying.”</p><p id="c9b7">Leaping up from the table, I ran through the living room and down the hallway to Paul’s bedroom door. I even knocked and called his name, half-expecting him to answer, and sheepishly apologized for that silliness about Facebook pronouncing him dead.</p><p id="68f7">Silence. I swung the door open. The room was quiet; the carpet still had the tracks of a vacuum from days earlier.</p><p id="2463">Denial turned to panic. Surely there is a series of very important things you’re supposed to do immediately when Facebook announces your roommate’s death. I couldn’t think of one.</p><p id="14ca">Several hours and a handful of frantic Facebook messages later, details emerged. Paul — a cheerful 35-year-old Irish guy who worked for a nonprofit and melted at the sight of a Dachshund — had been hit and killed by a car not far from our apartment two nights earlier. While I had assumed he was spending time with his friend, his body had been in the city morgue.</p><p id="4429">Paul had moved into our flat in San Francisco’s Cow Hollow neighborhood just a month earlier, and during most of that time, I had been overseas for work. We exchanged emails and talked on the phone a bit. The day after I came home, we sat in the window of a crowded Starbucks and laughed about how we would burn sage through the apartment — or whatever it is you’re supposed to do to expel the bad energy of departing roommates.</p><p id="4f8b">We talked about his upcoming trip to Ecuador and promised to speak only Spanish at home. I asked if he’d walked up to the marina to watch our stunning pink-sky sunsets, and his face lit up like I’d just cut his rent in half.</p><p id="41a1">“Oh my gosh, I have to do that!” he said.</p><p id="8ca7">Paul was an almost stranger who was becoming a friend. I was completely unprepared for how his sudden death would unravel and reshape my life.</p><p id="9ed9">For weeks following the crash, it felt like my world revolved around the dead roommate who no longer lived on the other side of my bedroom wall.</p><p id="e96c">I helped his friends sift through his things in search of a funeral suit. I walked up to his open casket and said goodbye to this wax-figure version of a guy whose face I’d last seen in my bathroom mirror a few days earlier. I sat wedged in the corner of a wooden pew as the chapel emptied and tried to compose myself before standing up to be introduced to Paul’s friend. How could I cry in front of someone who had lost so much more?</p><p id="dd4c">Exhausted from sleepless nights in an apartment that suddenly felt like a shrine to my dead roommate, I declined sincere invitations to join his friends at a pub after the funeral. Instead, I clicked down the street, left a message for a friend who didn’t pick up, and took the bus home to sit in Paul’s room and stare at a throw pillow with a Dachshund on it. The next day, his friend came over and tearfully asked if he could have the pillow, saying they had bought it at a flea market together.</p><p id="3cf1">I didn’t know what to do with the rest of Paul’s things, so for weeks I did nothing. His electric shaver stayed in the medicine cabinet, the cans of chipotle peppers on his shelf in the pantry. I watered the chiles he was growing in a green plastic container on a shelf in his room. On top of his dresser sat the tin of hair pomade he had been grabbing out of the medicine cabinet the last time I saw him.</p><p id="1e7f">Instead of working at the kitchen table, I went to coffee shops and generally stayed out of the house-slash-death-shrine as much as possible. But there was no escape. My heart pounded every time I waited to cross the street where he’d died. Our conversations played in my head like a movie — or perhaps a short film. An imaginary clock ticked down the remaining seconds of his life as we naively chatted about the best websites for plane tickets and how he was definitely going to start going to the gym again.</p><p id="5d15">If my reaction to the death of an almost stranger seems dramatic, perhaps it’s because Paul wasn’t supposed to be one more Craigslist roommate through the revolving door. He was a piece of a life that I was determined to deconstruct and rebuild from the ground up.</p><p id="427b">My rapidly approaching 30th birthday had prompted a determination to sculpt my existence into everything I wished my 20s had been. That meant reconnecting and disconnecting, thinking about the space between who I was and who I wanted to be. It meant surrounding myself with people who cared about the world, who woke up every day and did things that mattered. Whatever that meant.</p><p id="31af">A language interpreter supporting a nonprofit dedicated to empowering small business owners in developing nations, Paul relocated in pursuit of a new beginning following a breakup. Amidst mastering his fourth language, he shared aspirations of rekindling neglected friendships. Our lives, much alike, were undergoing reconstruction.</p><p id="c3cf">Until he died, of course.</p><p id="3fd8">Paul was 35, about five years older than me when he stepped off the curb at the wrong moment. Watching tearful friends approach his coffin one by one, I imagined myself lying in that varnished box with wax skin. Did I have five years? Two? A week? Was I living the way I would if I knew that the ticking clock was closer to zero than I wanted?</p><p id="c9ac">A few days after the funeral, I walked to the marina to watch that pink-sky sunset. As the sun bled fuchsia through the sky and the Golden Gate Bridge reflected in the tide, I thought about Paul’s body buried in the ground in Northern Ireland while his belongings were just as he had left them in our apartment a few blocks away. I imagined a parallel existence where he had never stepped off the curb that night, where I would come home and find him studying his Russian notes in a kitchen that smelled like chipotle.</p><p id="13da">Weeks later, I finally summoned the will to clear out Paul’s room. As I carefully packed away the roommate who was gone almost as soon as he arrived, I came across a dresser drawer stuffed with crumpled, recently worn clothes. I pulled out a T-shirt. It read: “All we have is now.”</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<article>
   
  <div><h2 id="unix-like-systems-with-x11-or-wayland">Unix like systems with X11 or Wayland</h2>
<p>All <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix">Unix like systems</a> with either <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System">X11</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayland_(protocol)">Wayland</a> are well supported since ever.</p>
<p>Linux with X11 and now Wayland is for a long time the primary system on that Kate work happens.</p>
<p>Over the years it was, like most of the <a href="https://apps.kde.org/">KDE applications</a>, ported to various <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Software_Distribution">BSD</a> variants.</p>
<p>Be it some mainstream Linux distribution like <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/">Fedora</a> or a niche one like <a href="http://nixos.org/">NixOS</a>, Kate is available as binary package.
You love BSD?
From <a href="https://freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a> to <a href="https://openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</a>, you can get a Kate package via your normal package system.</p>
<p>And in the normal case, you can just build it from source on your own, all needed patches should be in our repositories upstream.
If that is not the case for your system, please help to upstream them.</p>
<p>Below the current state of the master branch compiled on NixOS unstable with Wayland.</p>
<center><a href="https://cullmann.io/posts/kate-on-all-platforms-2024/images/2024-kate-linux-wayland.png" target="_blank"><img width="700" src="https://cullmann.io/posts/kate-on-all-platforms-2024/images/2024-kate-linux-wayland-small.png"></a></center>
<p>How to compile Kate on your own on a Unix like system and start to help to develop it can be found out <a href="https://kate-editor.org/build-it/">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="windows">Windows</h2>
<p>Since several years there are activities in the KDE community to provide our libraries and applications for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows">Windows</a>.</p>
<p>Even if that is a non-free platform, we can reach out to new users and developers that might later be then even interested to switch a full open platform.</p>
<p>Progress is slow, but steady.
We have Kate and some other applications in the official <a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/search/publisher?name=KDE+e.V.">Windows Store</a> and nightly build for more of them.
With reasonable effort you can develop Kate on Windows with <a href="https://community.kde.org/Get_Involved/development/Windows">Craft</a>.</p>
<p>Below the current state of the master branch running on Windows 11 inside VirtualBox.</p>
<center><a href="https://cullmann.io/posts/kate-on-all-platforms-2024/images/2024-kate-windows.png" target="_blank"><img width="700" src="https://cullmann.io/posts/kate-on-all-platforms-2024/images/2024-kate-windows-small.png"></a></center>
<p>If you like to try that, use the nighly installer linked on the <a href="https://kate-editor.org/get-it/">Kate website</a>.</p>
<h2 id="macos">macOS</h2>
<p>Beside Windows, the major other non-free platform Kate tries to support is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS">macOS</a>.</p>
<p>We have nighly build available for that and you can, like on Windows, develop Kate with the help of <a href="https://community.kde.org/Get_Involved/development/Mac">Craft</a>.</p>
<p>Below the current state of the master branch running native on my M2 ARM Mac Mini.</p>
<center><a href="https://cullmann.io/posts/kate-on-all-platforms-2024/images/2024-kate-macos.png" target="_blank"><img width="700" src="https://cullmann.io/posts/kate-on-all-platforms-2024/images/2024-kate-macos-small.png"></a></center>
<p>Same as for Windows, if you like to try that, use the nighly installer for either ARM or Intel Macs linked on the <a href="https://kate-editor.org/get-it/">Kate website</a>.</p>
<h2 id="other-platforms">Other Platforms</h2>
<p>Naturally there are more than the above mentioned operating systems around.</p>
<p>Beside the mobile ones like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)">Android</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS">iOS</a> that are not that interesting for Kate, many other desktop operating systems exist.</p>
<p>Even if the Kate team itself doesn’t put active work it them, that doesn’t mean Kate can’t run there.</p>
<p>Without any active work on our side, for example a Kate port for <a href="https://www.haiku-os.org/">Haiku</a> was done.
Some one-liner patches for that got even upstreamed.</p>
<p>If you work on some port of our stuff and need to upstream stuff, please contact us.
Even if you work on a non-mainstream system, as long as the patches are not too intrusive, we are interested to have them.</p>
<h2 id="help-us">Help us!</h2>
<p>Naturally the most of our developers are working on the Linux or some BSD.</p>
<p>That means the other systems are always in need of more people to help out, both on the programming and testing side.</p>
<p>For Kate, testing should be easy, grab a nighly build for Windows or macOS on the <a href="https://kate-editor.org/get-it/">Kate website</a>.
Or even better, get <a href="https://community.kde.org/Craft">Craft</a> running, that will make it easier to contribute, too.</p>
<p>One recent topic that needs love is the removal of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D-Bus">DBus</a> for Windows/macOS/Android and other systems that don’t use it normally.</p>
<p>If you are up to help with that, <a href="https://invent.kde.org/packaging/craft-blueprints-kde/-/issues/17">here</a> that is coordinated.
The current state is already sufficient that the nightly builds of Kate no longer hang on e.g. macOS, but still some frameworks like KIO will need more work.</p>
<p>Just don’t get that wrong, DBus is great on the Linux or BSD systems that use it natively, but it is a pain on systems that have no notion of DBus and leads there to hangs or the spawning of unwanted processes.
Beside that, the usefulness is low there, as there are no services on the bus to communicate with anyways.</p>

  I have recently released an open source tool called <a href="https://github.com/stolk/sotrace">sotrace</a>.
  It maps out the .so dependencies for a binary or library, and presents them in a nice graph.
</p>

<p>
  When I run it on my lean, mean, simple test program that runs a Vulkan Compute shader, I get this graph of dynamically linked libraries.
</p>

<p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiR9Q-0XTbsdCjFOxtrB_ls_eUT1EojYisOJyXmBBfj9DIHufcbkPuH12SVVORF3btQFOTYc5MUgLMgFtK860xwOCp63Xjb_b48DcUZ11UK340GEJgsYveD8bewIE276gvPTZyaH0zun2bMzCv3YRd68hha9ohGSknKCspmzx0_avNehLUruKrMJ_PAf-Ux/s1600/out-static.png"><img alt="" data-original-height="355" data-original-width="836" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiR9Q-0XTbsdCjFOxtrB_ls_eUT1EojYisOJyXmBBfj9DIHufcbkPuH12SVVORF3btQFOTYc5MUgLMgFtK860xwOCp63Xjb_b48DcUZ11UK340GEJgsYveD8bewIE276gvPTZyaH0zun2bMzCv3YRd68hha9ohGSknKCspmzx0_avNehLUruKrMJ_PAf-Ux/s1600/out-static.png"></a></p>

<p>
  So tidy!
</p>

<p>
  Because I also wanted run-time loaded dependencies, I added a mode where you can run sotool on a process-id instead.
  Running it on a process of the exact same binary, I gaze into the chasm of complexity with despair:

<p>
  Sweet Mother of Isaac Newton! What is this abomination?
</p>

<p>
  This runs a compute kernel on a GPU, with no graphics output at all.
  Why is X11 pulled in? And even some wayland stuff? Ugh.
  This is what I've come to see as hidden dependencies.
  My program depends on them, even though it does not link against them.
</p>

<p>
  Meanwhile, when I use CUDA instead of Vulkan, I get serenity back. CUDA FTW!
</p>

<p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg9dyXUDF9u4E2k4ebgxP-E34Oin035IOevzjmu1izVuuS2xsxPsNLlNb4AzXusBAVbemJLJ-aUyhM7nwqVbFzR_IrY_R1LXxqLacb7Cwfg7IjnBgltNm6It7PYvDJMX9J41oIhFLc5nMZk8Bk3FsMQSUR9Tzdwnc_bbE5ouPvYTtNSlgTRCgqmWUSy4RKz/s714/out-cuda.png"><img alt="" data-original-height="570" data-original-width="714" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg9dyXUDF9u4E2k4ebgxP-E34Oin035IOevzjmu1izVuuS2xsxPsNLlNb4AzXusBAVbemJLJ-aUyhM7nwqVbFzR_IrY_R1LXxqLacb7Cwfg7IjnBgltNm6It7PYvDJMX9J41oIhFLc5nMZk8Bk3FsMQSUR9Tzdwnc_bbE5ouPvYTtNSlgTRCgqmWUSy4RKz/s600/out-cuda.png" width="600"></a></p>

<p>
  And for completeness, when I run the OpenCL version of my compute kernel:

  So, if you are a developer on Linux, give it a try and be amazed at what you dredge up.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
	<p><span><span>A</span></span>s diligent taxpayers breathe a sigh of relief that the hassle of filing their tax forms is over for another year, the Internal Revenue Service continues to let most U.S. hospitals <a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/nonprofit-hospitals-tax-breaks-community-benefit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pay nothing</a> in federal taxes. It’s time for Congress to take a hard look at the IRS’s hand in health care.</p>
<p>The agency uses a vague “community benefit” standard to liberally grant tax-exempt status to so-called nonprofit hospitals even as many of them are financially taking advantage of sick Americans with inflated medical bills. Several of my Johns Hopkins colleagues and I <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2737183" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> a study in the Journal of the American Medical Association showing that some nonprofit hospitals sue and garnish the wages of low-income patients who can’t afford to pay their medical bills. Where’s the community benefit in that? Nonprofit hospitals are supposed to be compassionate and merciful, not predatory and ruthless.</p>
<p>Many hospitals force people who are suffering and seeking care in earnest to sign their financial life away as a condition of treatment. Some make <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/30/well/live/surprise-medical-bills.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contesting a bill</a> difficult and others <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/4107837-just-over-a-third-of-hospitals-are-complying-with-price-transparency-rules-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">do not comply</a> with the federal <a href="https://www.cms.gov/priorities/key-initiatives/hospital-price-transparency/hospitals" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hospital transparency rule</a> which requires hospitals to post prices for common shoppable services. The most recent money game that nonprofit hospitals are dialing up is adding billions of dollars in <a href="https://www.wsj.com/health/healthcare/hidden-hospital-fees-cost-patients-hundreds-of-dollars-0024cd95" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“facility fees”</a> for routine care. These billing tricks are fleecing everyday Americans. Congress could make them disappear overnight if it passed a law disqualifying hospitals that use them from getting the coveted tax-exempt benefit.</p>
<p>Many tax-exempt hospitals argue that they provide millions of dollars in free care. But here’s what’s really going on: Much of what they call free care is emergency care that hospitals are required to provide by law (the 1986 <a href="https://www.cms.gov/medicare/regulations-guidance/legislation/emergency-medical-treatment-labor-act" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act</a> requires hospitals to care for anyone who walks in with an emergent condition). But after the care has been provided, patients are often hounded for payment, often at an artificially inflated price. Hospitals then report the difference between their high sticker price and what they actually collect after shaking down a patient as charity care.</p>
<p>But that’s not charity. In a twist of irony, a 2021 study <a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/abs/10.1377/hlthaff.2020.01627" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published in Health Affairs</a> found that for-profit hospitals provided 65% <em>more</em> charity care than nonprofit ones.</p>
<p>The bar for receiving tax-exempt status should not be simply abiding by the law.</p>
		
		
<p>Hospitals leaders across the nation have told me that they need to avoid federal taxes in order to survive. But the way taxes work, businesses are taxed only on their profits. Some hospitals hide their profits in cost-shift accounting and loan refinancing, even engaging in aggressive real estate and venture capital investing. According to <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/951644600" target="_blank" rel="noopener">public tax records</a>, Cedars Sinai in Beverly Hills had an income surplus of $750 million in 2022 and paid no federal taxes. Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York had $400 million and also paid no federal taxes. The top three hospital administrators there made nearly $20 million in salaries.</p>
<p>Try booking an appointment at these or any nonprofit hospital and see if you can do it without insurance or cash up front. It’s nearly impossible. Most nonprofit hospitals will refuse to schedule appointments, even cancer care, unless you financially qualify by showing your ability to pay.</p>
<p>If hospitals schedule appointments and operations only for people who financially qualify, arguing that they are a business, they should pay their fair share of taxes like every other American business. A Kaiser Family Foundation <a href="https://www.kff.org/health-costs/issue-brief/the-estimated-value-of-tax-exemption-for-nonprofit-hospitals-was-about-28-billion-in-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study</a> estimated the total value of tax exemptions for nonprofit hospitals was $28 billion in 2020 alone. By my calculation, that’s equivalent to a $107 tax credit for every American who filed a return that year.</p>
<p>Momentum to stop this gaming of the system is growing. In August, a bipartisan group of U.S. senators including Bill Cassidy and Elizabeth Warren <a href="https://www.cassidy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cassidy-colleagues-probe-potential-abuse-of-tax-exempt-status-by-nonprofit-hospitals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">demanded more transparency</a> from the IRS on the issue after a <a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-23-106777.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">General Accountability Office report</a> found that the agency “did not have a well-documented process” to ensure that hospitals met tax-exempt criteria.</p>
			
		
<p>In October, Bernie Sanders, the chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions committee stressed the need to address the problem. “Many nonprofit hospital systems across the country are failing to provide low-income Americans with the affordable medical care required by their nonprofit status — despite receiving billions in tax benefits and providing exorbitant compensation packages to their senior executives,” he said in a <a href="https://www.help.senate.gov/chair/newsroom/press/news-chairman-sanders-releases-new-report-showing-major-nonprofit-hospital-systems-exploiting-tax-breaks-and-prioritizing-ceo-pay-over-helping-patients-afford-medical-care" target="_blank" rel="noopener">statement</a>.</p>
<p>In another sign that government officials are getting fed up with hospitals paying no taxes, in 2023 a Pennsylvania judge revoked a hospital’s property tax exemption. This action came after the Pottstown school district sued the hospital, arguing that its special tax treatment resulted in <a href="https://whyy.org/articles/pa-hospitals-revoked-property-tax-exemption/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$900,000 less revenue</a> for the school each year.</p>
<p>It’s not just the IRS’s lackadaisical approach to hospitals that’s mind-boggling. It’s also the agency’s hostility to direct primary care and other creative strategies developed by doctors to address chronic diseases. The IRS does not allow individuals or families who subscribe to direct primary care — a type of intensive primary care that takes extra time to focus on prevention — to include that cost as a tax-deductible health savings account expense. A <a href="https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-improving-price-quality-transparency-american-healthcare-put-patients-first/#:~:text=potentially%20including%20direct%20primary%20care%20arrangements%20and%20healthcare%20sharing%20ministries%2C%20as%20eligible%20medical%20expenses" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2019 White House executive order</a> challenged this position to no avail. Last month, the IRS sternly <a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-alert-beware-of-companies-misrepresenting-nutrition-wellness-and-general-health-expenses-as-medical-care-for-fsas-hsas-hras-and-msas" target="_blank" rel="noopener">warned</a> Americans that they cannot use their own health savings account to buy healthy foods as directed by their doctors.</p>
<p>The IRS continues to propagate a reactionary approach to sickness rather than a proactive approach to health. Chronic diseases are the leading cause of death in the U.S. and consume a majority of the $4.5 trillion Americans <a href="https://www.cms.gov/data-research/statistics-trends-and-reports/national-health-expenditure-data/nhe-fact-sheet" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spend on health care</a>. The current Whac-a-Mole system isn’t working. Most American adults take <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/prescription-drugs/too-many-meds-americas-love-affair-with-prescription-medication/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">4 or more prescription medications</a> regularly, making the U.S. the most medicated population in the world. The country needs to try <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7023959/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new approaches</a> to health.</p>
<p>Instead of scolding Americans who sign up for direct primary care or want to eat healthier foods, the IRS should hold hospitals accountable for the taxes they should be paying.</p>
