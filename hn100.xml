<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article data-comment-id="158-" id="158-"><span><span><a href="https://antirez.com/user/antirez">antirez</a></span> 1 hour ago. 11169 views.  </span><pre>I love writing software, line by line. It could be said that my career was a continuous effort to create software well written, minimal, where the human touch was the fundamental feature. I also hope for a society where the last are not forgotten. Moreover, I don't want AI to economically succeed, I don't care if the current economic system is subverted (I could be very happy, honestly, if it goes in the direction of a massive redistribution of wealth). But, I would not respect myself and my intelligence if my idea of software and society would impair my vision: facts are facts, and AI is going to change programming forever.

In 2020 I left my job in order to write a novel about AI, universal basic income, a society that adapted to the automation of work facing many challenges. At the very end of 2024 I opened a YouTube channel focused on AI, its use in coding tasks, its potential social and economical effects. But while I recognized what was going to happen very early, I thought that we had more time before programming would be completely reshaped, at least a few years. I no longer believe this is the case. Recently, state of the art LLMs are able to complete large subtasks or medium size projects alone, almost unassisted, given a good set of hints about what the end result should be. The degree of success you'll get is related to the kind of programming you do (the more isolated, and the more textually representable, the better: system programming is particularly apt), and to your ability to create a mental representation of the problem to communicate to the LLM. But, in general, it is now clear that for most projects, writing the code yourself is no longer sensible, if not to have fun.

In the past week, just prompting, and inspecting the code to provide guidance from time to time, in a few hours I did the following four tasks, in hours instead of weeks:

1. I modified my linenoise library to support UTF-8, and created a framework for line editing testing that uses an emulated terminal that is able to report what is getting displayed in each character cell. Something that I always wanted to do, but it was hard to justify the work needed just to test a side project of mine. But if you can just describe your idea, and it materializes in the code, things are very different.

2. I fixed transient failures in the Redis test. This is very annoying work, timing related issues, TCP deadlock conditions, and so forth. Claude Code iterated for all the time needed to reproduce it, inspected the state of the processes to understand what was happening, and fixed the bugs.

3. Yesterday I wanted a pure C library that would be able to do the inference of BERT like embedding models. Claude Code created it in 5 minutes. Same output and same speed (15% slower) than PyTorch. 700 lines of code. A Python tool to convert the GTE-small model.

4. In the past weeks I operated changes to Redis Streams internals. I had a design document for the work I did. I tried to give it to Claude Code and it reproduced my work in, like, 20 minutes or less (mostly because I'm slow at checking and authorizing to run the commands needed).

It is simply impossible not to see the reality of what is happening. Writing code is no longer needed for the most part. It is now a lot more interesting to understand what to do, and how to do it (and, about this second part, LLMs are great partners, too). It does not matter if AI companies will not be able to get their money back and the stock market will crash. All that is irrelevant, in the long run. It does not matter if this or the other CEO of some unicorn is telling you something that is off putting, or absurd. Programming changed forever, anyway.

How do I feel, about all the code I wrote that was ingested by LLMs? I feel great to be part of that, because I see this as a continuation of what I tried to do all my life: democratizing code, systems, knowledge. LLMs are going to help us to write better software, faster, and will allow small teams to have a chance to compete with bigger companies. The same thing open source software did in the 90s.

However, this technology is far too important to be in the hands of a few companies. For now, you can do the pre-training better or not, you can do reinforcement learning in a much more effective way than others, but the open models, especially the ones produced in China, continue to compete (even if they are behind) with frontier models of closed labs. There is a sufficient democratization of AI, so far, even if imperfect. But: it is absolutely not obvious that it will be like that forever. I'm scared about the centralization. At the same time, I believe neural networks, at scale, are simply able to do incredible things, and that there is not enough "magic" inside current frontier AI for the other labs and teams not to catch up (otherwise it would be very hard to explain, for instance, why OpenAI, Anthropic and Google are so near in their results, for years now).

As a programmer, I want to write more open source than ever, now. I want to improve certain repositories of mine abandoned for time concerns. I want to apply AI to my Redis workflow. Improve the Vector Sets implementation and then other data structures, like I'm doing with Streams now.

But I'm worried for the folks that will get fired. It is not clear what the dynamic at play will be: will companies try to have more people, and to build more? Or will they try to cut salary costs, having fewer programmers that are better at prompting? And, there are other sectors where humans will become completely replaceable, I fear.

What is the social solution, then? Innovation can't be taken back after all. I believe we should vote for governments that recognize what is happening, and are willing to support those who will remain jobless. And, the more people get fired, the more political pressure there will be to vote for those who will guarantee a certain degree of protection. But I also look forward to the good AI could bring: new progress in science, that could help lower the suffering of the human condition, which is not always happy.

Anyway, back to programming. I have a single suggestion for you, my friend. Whatever you believe about what the Right Thing should be, you can't control it by refusing what is happening right now. Skipping AI is not going to help you or your career. Think about it. Test these new tools, with care, with weeks of work, not in a five minutes test where you can just reinforce your own beliefs. Find a way to multiply yourself, and if it does not work for you, try again every few months.

Yes, maybe you think that you worked so hard to learn coding, and now machines are doing it for you. But what was the fire inside you, when you coded till night to see your project working? It was building. And now you can build more and better, if you find your way to use AI effectively. The fun is still there, untouched.</pre></article></div></div>]]></description>

But the story didn't end there. In fact, it was just beginning.</p><p>Among the experts was Alier Marrero, a soft-spoken, Cuban-born neurologist who had been working in the province for about six years. Marrero would share some worrying information with the other members of the group. He had been seeing patients with unexplained CJD-like symptoms for several years, he said, including young people who showed signs of a rapidly progressing dementia. The number of cases was already more than 20, Marrero said, and several patients had already died.</p><p>Because of the apparent similarity to CJD, Marrero had been reporting these cases to Canada's Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease Surveillance System, or CJDSS. But the results had been coming back negative. Marrero was stumped.</p><p>More worrying still, he was seeing a dizzying array of symptoms among the patients, according to his notes. There were cases of dementia, weight loss, unsteadiness, jerking movements and facial twitches. There were patients with spasms, visions, limb pain, muscle atrophy, dry skin and hair loss. Many said they were suffering with both insomnia and waking hallucinations. Patients reported excessive sweating and excessive drooling. Several exhibited Capgras Delusion, which causes someone to believe that a person close to them has been replaced by an identical-looking imposter. Others appeared to lose the ability to speak. One patient would report that she had forgotten how to write the letter Q.</p><p>Marrero ordered test after test. But he was at a loss. "I just kept seeing new patients, I kept documenting new cases, and I kept seeing new people dying," he recalled.

But there came no scientific breakthrough, no new understanding of neurology, no expensive new treatments. Instead, last year, a bombshell research paper authored by several Canadian neurologists and neuroscientists concluded that there was in fact no mystery disease, and that the patients had all likely suffered from previously known neurological, medical, or psychiatric conditions. The New Brunswick cluster was, one of the paper's authors told the BBC, a "house of cards".</p><p>To report this story, the BBC spent time with Marrero and spoke to a dozen of his patients or their relatives — some of whom are telling their story for the first time — as well as key scientists, experts, and government officials, and reviewed hundreds of pages of internal emails and documents obtained by freedom of information requests.</p><p>We can reveal that at least one cluster patient has now opted for death via medical assistance in dying — legal in Canada since 2016. The diagnosis on the death certificate, according to the doctor who signed it off, was "degenerative neurological condition of unknown cause". At least one other cluster patient is currently considering assisted dying.</p><p>The research paper published last year could have marked the end of a strange chapter in Canadian science. Except, hundreds of the patients disagree. Defiant, fiercely loyal to Marrero, and backed by passionate patient advocates, they argue that the paper is flawed and reject any notion that the cluster might not be real.</p><p>Many believe instead that they have been poisoned by an industrial environmental toxin, and that the government of New Brunswick has conspired against them to cover it up.</p><p>"I'm not a conspiracy theorist type person, at all, but I honestly think it's financially motivated," said Jillian Lucas, one of the patients.

All agreed that Marrero needed considerable support. Strong said he could arrange additional staff and offered himself up as a consultant. The CIHR offered the province of New Brunswick C$5 million ($3.6m; £2.7m) to investigate.</p><p>And the mystery disease got a name: the "New Brunswick Neurological Syndrome of Unknown Cause". In an email to Marrero in April 2021, Strong called it "one of the most unusual constellations of findings I have ever seen".</p><p>"We all owe you a debt of gratitude," he wrote.</p><p>But not everyone was on board. Dr Gerard Jansen, a neuropathologist who was attached to the CJD Surveillance System, had noticed something unusual when referrals from Marrero's office started piling up. Jansen recalled feeling "flabbergasted" at Marrero's notes, which he said featured an array of broad and unrelated clinical observations — a "diarrhea of symptoms".</p><p>Jansen saw clues in the patients' files that he said pointed to already defined neurological diseases. When he examined brain tissue samples of a few cluster patients who had died, he found signs of Alzheimer's disease and Lewy body dementia.</p><p>He was alarmed. His superior, Coulthart, appeared to believe something unexplained was happening in New Brunswick, Jansen said. Keen to get his concerns down in writing, he sent Coulthart a long and detailed email.</p><p>"All available evidence and logic" pointed to a collection of different diseases, Jansen wrote.</p><p>"The patients are real, but the clustering as a mystery disease is not."</p></div><figure><div data-component="image-block"><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" aria-label="image unavailable"><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/e0f6/live/cf6fbd50-ec79-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.png.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/e0f6/live/cf6fbd50-ec79-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.png.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e0f6/live/cf6fbd50-ec79-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.png.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/e0f6/live/cf6fbd50-ec79-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.png.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/e0f6/live/cf6fbd50-ec79-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.png.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/e0f6/live/cf6fbd50-ec79-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.png.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/e0f6/live/cf6fbd50-ec79-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.png.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e0f6/live/cf6fbd50-ec79-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.png.webp" loading="lazy" alt="grey line"></p></div></figure><div data-component="text-block"><p>The early cases seemed to be grouped around two locations: Moncton and the Acadian Peninsula. Suspecting an environmental link, the scientists and officials considered various possible culprits, from a rare moose-borne parasite to blue-green algae blooms to Agent Orange sprayed on the province in the 1970s. Nothing bore fruit.</p><p>Marrero said he had observed an uptick in cases in late summer and early autumn — forestry spraying season — and he zeroed in on a controversial herbicide called glyphosate. Chronic exposure to glyphosate, which is used extensively by New Brunswick's forestry industry, has been linked by some studies to neuroinflammation and Parkinson's disease. (Forest NB, an industry body, told the BBC that glyphosate was used in compliance with regulations and was "not expected to pose risks" to human health or the environment.)</p><p>According to Marrero, many of his patients were showing highly elevated levels of both glyphosate and various heavy metals. Though when asked by the BBC what proportion of his 500 or so patients had concerning results, he refused to say. "I don't want to provide exact numbers of anything, but let's say it's an unusual number.

Strong, the CIHR director, said he thought a full "boots-on-the-ground" investigation was needed. The same month, a specialist clinic — the Mind Clinic — was set up in New Brunswick with Marrero at the helm to treat the cluster patients. With the $5m on offer from the CIHR, and the backing of Strong and other top federal scientists, all the conditions appeared set to get to the bottom of the mystery.</p><p>But then, everything changed. In May, New Brunswick effectively suspended the collaboration with the federal scientists. The province also decided not to take up the $5m on offer from the CIHR. According to Marrero, the decision killed off any prospect of finding an answer. "Everybody received that email like a cold shower," he said.</p><p>None of the provincial officials involved agreed to talk to the BBC on the record. But it is clear there was concern about Marrero's methods and about the nature of his contact with Coulthart, Strong and the other federal scientists. The view of some at senior levels of the New Brunswick government was that the informal working group, seduced by the possibility of a scientific mystery, was circumventing the province.</p><p>But the decision to leave the money on the table, rather than spend it investigating, fuelled suspicions that New Brunswick wanted to avoid scrutiny of its environment. According to Kat Lanteigne, the executive director of Canadian health non-profit Bloodwatch and a tireless supporter of Marrero, the actions of the province amounted to a full-blown cover up.</p><p>"They pulled the plug because they just don't want anybody looking," Lanteigne said.

The patients — now 105 in number — were attending sporadic appointments with Marrero at the Mind Clinic but seeing little progress. Jillian Lucas's symptoms were worsening at such a rate that she had begun to weigh something once unthinkable to her: medically assisted dying.</p><p>At the clinic, appointments with Marrero could be strangely conspiratorial, patients said. During one appointment, Lucas's stepmother Susan recalled, Marrero put his hand up, told them to stop talking, and went to the door to listen. "He said, 'I believe we are being recorded'."</p><p>Stacie Quigley-Cormier, whose stepdaughter Gabrielle was the youngest member of the cluster, said Marrero always spoke in a hushed tone.</p><p>"The experience with Dr Marrero — and other patients talk about this too — is you make sure you start talking after the door is closed, and there's a quiet tone to his voice, and you make sure you're not talking in the hallways and things like that."</p><p>Marrero declined to discuss it.

Soon Strickland could no longer manage her care. But to get her a place in assisted living he needed a letter of support from Marrero. "I think I waited four months for that letter," Strickland recalled. "I kept phoning and asking."</p><p>Eventually he gave up and turned to the Mind Clinic, he said, and got the letter. And the Mind Clinic neurologists gave April something else she needed — a firm diagnosis. She was suffering from a form of frontotemporal dementia. In the end, Marrero "did nothing for April," Strickland said. "I guess he was more interested in proving the mystery illness than he was helping his patients," he said.</p><p>Sandi Partridge also chose to remain with the Mind Clinic. She felt a deep sense of loyalty to Marrero, but she also saw simple common sense in getting a second opinion.</p><p>Partridge had first seen Marrero in 2020, after suffering headaches and balance issues. He ordered a barrage of tests — according to Partridge she had two MRIs, two EEGs, a SPECT, a CAT scan and a spinal tap, as well as more than a dozen different antibody tests. "It was mostly a lot of testing with Dr Marrero," she recalled. "Every time he would see me, it would be an hour and a half, sometimes two hours, and he would retest me every single time."</p><p>But every test came back negative. Partridge had also provided Marrero with a video of her having a seizure at home, which he studied. He diagnosed her with the mystery illness.

When nothing showed up, he diagnosed her with the mystery illness. Canada was deep in the isolation of the Covid lockdown, but Marrero reassured them.</p><p>"He said, there's a dozen other people at least that are experiencing similar things to what you're experiencing, and I don't have answers for it yet," stepmother Stacie Quigley-Cormier recalled. "He told her that she wasn't alone."</p><p>There was one test Marrero couldn't secure: a PET scan, because the hard-up province was largely reserving them for cancer patients. So Cormier's parents took her to Toronto for the scan and a second opinion by a leading neurologist there, Dr Anthony Lang.</p><p>After a multi-day evaluation at a specialist neurology centre, Lang diagnosed Cormier with FND. Her tests showed that conscious movements were weak but forced reflex or automotive movements were normal and healthy. It pointed to psychology.</p><p>The Quigley-Cormiers were initially prepared to accept the FND diagnosis, they said. But they left Toronto unhappy after Lang told them to stop treating Cormier as though she had a terminal illness because it was reinforcing her condition.</p><p>A few weeks later, Lang called Cormier to inform her that a delayed test result had shown some reduced blood flow in her brain — something Marrero had also observed — and which can be caused by various medical or psychological issues including depression. Lang told Cormier the abnormality was slight and bore no relation to her symptoms, so she shouldn't worry about it.</p><p>The call didn't sit well with the Quigley-Cormiers.</p><p>"There was no reason to call her personal phone when he knew she had memory problems," said her father Andre, angrily.</p></div><figure><div data-component="image-block"><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" aria-label="image unavailable"><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/bc5c/live/9cdddc70-ed44-11f0-8cc8-8329494b82ad.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/bc5c/live/9cdddc70-ed44-11f0-8cc8-8329494b82ad.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/bc5c/live/9cdddc70-ed44-11f0-8cc8-8329494b82ad.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/bc5c/live/9cdddc70-ed44-11f0-8cc8-8329494b82ad.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/bc5c/live/9cdddc70-ed44-11f0-8cc8-8329494b82ad.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/bc5c/live/9cdddc70-ed44-11f0-8cc8-8329494b82ad.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/bc5c/live/9cdddc70-ed44-11f0-8cc8-8329494b82ad.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/bc5c/live/9cdddc70-ed44-11f0-8cc8-8329494b82ad.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Global News Jillian Lucas and other patients stand in front of a government building holding signs saying 'We are not a mystery, 'We stand by Doctor Marrero' and other slogans.

The real cause of the cluster, they concluded, was serial misdiagnosis by Marrero, compounded by credulous media reporting, the limitations of New Brunswick's public health system, institutional distrust sown by the pandemic and the actions of a small group of people "co-opting the crisis to suit their agenda".</p></div><figure><div data-component="image-block"><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" aria-label="image unavailable"><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/96aa/live/bcdfb3f0-e44c-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/96aa/live/bcdfb3f0-e44c-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/96aa/live/bcdfb3f0-e44c-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/96aa/live/bcdfb3f0-e44c-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/96aa/live/bcdfb3f0-e44c-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/96aa/live/bcdfb3f0-e44c-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/96aa/live/bcdfb3f0-e44c-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/96aa/live/bcdfb3f0-e44c-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Dr Lang stands outside the neurology centre where he works, in Toronto, looking down at the camera in a white lab coat.

The Quigley-Cormiers are furious that Gabrielle's data was used for the study, and their lawyers have sent letters to Lang and to the journal alleging the paper was a violation of her privacy. JAMA declined to comment on the dispute. Lang said that the research was legal, ethical and appropriately anonymised. As for the alleged violation of privacy, he pointed out that the only reason anyone knew Cormier's data was used was because her father and stepmother had told the media, along with many other details about her life.</p></div><figure><div data-component="image-block"><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" aria-label="image unavailable"><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/3402/live/f9f81b30-ec79-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.png.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/3402/live/f9f81b30-ec79-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.png.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/3402/live/f9f81b30-ec79-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.png.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/3402/live/f9f81b30-ec79-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.png.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/3402/live/f9f81b30-ec79-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.png.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/3402/live/f9f81b30-ec79-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.png.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/3402/live/f9f81b30-ec79-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.png.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/3402/live/f9f81b30-ec79-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.png.webp" loading="lazy" alt="grey line"></p></div></figure><div data-component="text-block"><p>On a bright morning this past September, Marrero was sitting in his home office in a large cottage-style house on a plot of land just outside of Moncton. A stone fountain burbled softly in his Japanese-inspired peace garden. Birds sang in his own patch of forest — untouched by herbicides or pesticides, he said.</p><p>Marrero is undeniably charismatic. He has a warm smile and demeanour. He speaks gently, but with authority. He remembers small details about people he barely knows and asks about their wellbeing in a manner that conveys genuine care.</p><p>Settled in his office chair, he recalled with obvious pleasure that not so long ago, some of Canada's top scientists had sat with him around that very desk, ready to take on a scientific mystery. But now, Marrero seemed increasingly isolated.</p><p>"They are trying to present me as it," he said, dejectedly. "I was part of it, but I was not it. The only difference is, when the table was empty, I stayed."</p><p>Of Marrero's early federal collaborators — Drs Coulthart, Cashman, Strong, and Weiss — only Coulthart agreed to speak to the BBC about the cluster. He denied ever having been convinced by the idea of a unified, mystery syndrome. "As a scientist, I use the word convinced very, very sparingly," he said. "But don't let anybody kid you — if anyone says they know what's going on or isn't going on in New Brunswick, they're either lying or grossly mistaken. Because nobody has the facts."</p></div><figure><div data-component="image-block"><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" aria-label="image unavailable"><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/4310/live/44874040-e44b-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/4310/live/44874040-e44b-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4310/live/44874040-e44b-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/4310/live/44874040-e44b-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/4310/live/44874040-e44b-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/4310/live/44874040-e44b-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/4310/live/44874040-e44b-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4310/live/44874040-e44b-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Dr Marrero, in a navy suit and red tie, sits in a wooden chair in his home office, in the light coming in from the door windows.

Unlike the previous studies, it will examine the claims of elevated glyphosate and heavy metals in the patients. At times, the stakes seem impossibly high. "Lives hang in the balance," read a recent letter to Premier Susan Holt, signed by 72 of the patients. "It is within your power to honour them, cherish them, and care for them," the letter said. "Or you can abandon them and let them wither, fade, and ultimately die. Please join us on the right side of history."</p><p>The patient advocates, led by Bloodwatch director Kat Lanteigne, have arguably done more than anyone to keep the story of the cluster going, with an operation that includes lobbying the government, briefing the press and sending legal letters to scientists.</p><p>Lanteigne has publicly attacked both Jansen and Lang over the JAMA study, branding their work inaccurate and unethical. She denied harassing Jansen, saying she had never spoken to him directly and emailed him only once. "I have a record of speaking truth to power and I have always worked with integrity and honesty," she said.</p><p>Both Lang and Jansen are standing their ground.</p><p>"What we have here is a case of misdiagnosis, evolving to misinformation, and sadly resulting in suffering for patients and families," Lang said.</p><p>"I would even go further," Jansen said, regarding the alleged misdiagnosis of the patients. "I would say they are being abused."</p><p>Few others are willing to criticise Marrero so openly. Privately, former senior government officials and colleagues of Marrero have questioned whether he should have been investigated. The Royal College of Physicians told the BBC it could not comment on whether there had been complaints against any individual physician, and none have been made public in relation to Marrero. Any sanction process would typically begin with a complaint.</p><p>And that was the issue, one former senior health official said.</p><p>"It has to be a patient complaint," they said. "And all his patients love him."</p></div><figure><div data-component="image-block"><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" aria-label="image unavailable"><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/0f5d/live/040c5e10-ec7a-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.png.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0f5d/live/040c5e10-ec7a-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.png.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0f5d/live/040c5e10-ec7a-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.png.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/0f5d/live/040c5e10-ec7a-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.png.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/0f5d/live/040c5e10-ec7a-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.png.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0f5d/live/040c5e10-ec7a-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.png.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/0f5d/live/040c5e10-ec7a-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.png.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0f5d/live/040c5e10-ec7a-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.png.webp" loading="lazy" alt="grey line "></p></div></figure><div data-component="text-block"><p>The last time Jillian Lucas saw Marrero was more than a year ago.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p>This morning I woke up and headed to my bomb shelter to grab the bike pump to inflate the tyres on my children’s bikes. The handle got slightly tangled up in the fibre optic cables so I lifted up the cables to free the pump.</p><p>Like cookie crumbs the fibre cable’s sleeve jackets crumbled in my hands.</p><hr><p><img src="https://alienchow.dev/images/fibre_disintegration/fibre_jacket_crumbling.jpg" width="" height="" alt="fibre no more"></p><hr><p>Before I could even utter “Oh fuck no”, another section of the cable exploded outwards with thin metal wires jutting out from what seems to be like strands of white plastic threads, which I assume is the Kevlar sheath. I think I must have stood in my pseudo server room in shock for a whole minute, unable to move or process what had happened. A main component of why I was in sheer horror was the fact that I had stupidly buried all of these cables under my cement flooring in PVC trunking from my shelter to all of the rooms in the flat. If this cable fails, the connection from the server room to a specific room would be permanently severed. The room for this particular cable turned out to be my home office where my homelab MS-A2 resided.</p><p>I had purchased these cables from <a href="https://www.fs.com/sg/products/70220.html">FS.com</a> roughly 3.5 years ago in 2022. Because I was burying the cables underground permanently, I opted to get the <strong>MiLiTaRy GrAdE</strong> armoured fibre cables for this purpose.</p><hr><p><img src="https://alienchow.dev/images/fibre_disintegration/original_order.png" width="" height="" alt="MILITARY GRADE"></p><hr><p>The cables had been kept spooled up with a radius of around 5cm for 3 whole years, lightly tied together with hook and loop cable fasteners and hung on laundry hooks in the shelter all this time.</p><hr><p><img src="https://alienchow.dev/images/fibre_disintegration/organisation.jpg" width="" height="" alt="How cables were stored"></p><hr><p>The destroyed cable is the only one that I had unravelled recently to patch into my UDM to enable SFP+ connection to my office space. As it turns out, armoured cables in this specific instance aren’t really meant for movement, it’s likely more of a bury and forget purpose. In hindsight I should’ve connected all of the cables to a fibre patch panel on the wall so that they would never move, then connect the patch panel to my UDM with easily replaceable LSZH cables.</p><p>But it’s too late now, all I can do is to salvage the situation. I headed out and purchased 3M self-bonding rubber electrical tape 23, and Temflex 160 vinyl electrical tape. The idea I had was to use the compression properties of the stretched rubber tape to hold the corrugated metal sheath and wire mesh in place, before wrapping a second vinyl protection layer outside with the 160.</p><hr><p><img src="https://alienchow.dev/images/fibre_disintegration/wrap.jpg" width="" height="" alt="wrapping away"></p><hr><p>However, the wrapping process itself requires me to slowly shift the cable around to hook onto higher ground to prevent kinks. The action itself triggered more jacket failures. Some of the failures actually forced the cable in a sharp right angle, which I am almost certain has caused kinks and cracks in the inner fibre strand. RIP.</p><hr><p><img src="https://alienchow.dev/images/fibre_disintegration/shit.jpg" width="" height="" alt="shit">

<img src="https://alienchow.dev/images/fibre_disintegration/shit_shit_shit.jpg" width="" height="" alt="shit shit shit"></p><hr><p>At this point, I’m looking at rebuilding the entire sleeve jacket of anything that’s exposed and movable with electrical tape. What I had previously thought was a good idea to keep about 5-10m of slack to allow me to easily move my server rack around is now causing me more problems as good electrical tape ain’t cheap. I have to essentially repair around 10 metres of jacket without accidentally destroying parts inside trunking that I am unable to reach. This is assuming that the 4 other untouched cables wouldn’t spontaneously crumble as well. Based on how they felt in my hand, I think it is an inevitable outcome.</p><p>I’m pretty certain that datacentre technicians reading this by chance would mock my idiotic setup and I would be inclined to join in. This is not a good day.</p><p>On the dim side of things, at least it seems like fibre optic cables are pretty hardy. My MS-A2 SFP+ connection is still working and <code>speedtest-cli</code> is reporting around 4000/3000 Mbps up/down speeds to my ISP (10G fibre internet plan). UDM is seeing 6000/7000, so the fibre cable is definitely compromised. :(</p></div></article></div>]]></description>

<p>"Bobby will forever be a guiding force whose unique artistry reshaped American music," family says announcing musician's death</p>
	</div><div><div>
	<p><a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/bob-weir/" id="auto-tag_bob-weir" data-tag="bob-weir">Bob Weir</a>, the singer, songwriter, guitarist, and co-founder of the <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/grateful-dead/" id="auto-tag_grateful-dead" data-tag="grateful-dead">Grateful Dead</a>, whose songs about sunshine daydreams and truckin’ helped turn the jam band into a 60-year musical empire, has died at age 78.</p><p>“It is with profound sadness that we share the passing of Bobby Weir,” Weir’s family wrote in a statement. A date of death was not immediately available. “He transitioned peacefully, surrounded by loved ones, after courageously beating cancer as only Bobby could. Unfortunately, he succumbed to underlying lung issues.”</p></div>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-instgrm-captioned="" data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/p/DTWTKqKgKeP/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" data-instgrm-version="14"></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>
	“Bobby will forever be a guiding force whose unique artistry reshaped American music,” the statement added. “His work did more than fill rooms with music; it was warm sunlight that filled the soul, building a community, a language, and a feeling&nbsp;of family that generations of fans carry with them.&nbsp;Every chord he played, every word he sang was an integral part of the stories he wove. There was an invitation: to feel, to question, to wander, and to belong.”</p>



<p>
	As the band’s co-lead singer, writer, and guitarist beside Jerry Garcia, his elliptical riffs, eccentric song structures, and slightly off-kilter stage presence made him an intrinsic ingredient to the Dead, up to and beyond its demise following Garcia’s death in 1995. Weir often went under-recognized compared to the larger-than-life Garcia (one of the first songs he wrote in the Dead was called “The Other One”). Yet, the band’s bassist Phil Lesh characterized Weir’s contribution as that of “a stealth machine.”

	</p>




<p>
	Robert Hall Weir was born in San Francisco on October 16, 1947, to a college student who gave him up for adoption. He was raised in an affluent Bay Area suburb, where he managed to get kicked out of both preschool and the Cub Scouts, and suffered from undiagnosed dyslexia. At Fountain Valley, a Colorado school for boys with behavioral problems, he met<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Perry_Barlow" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"> John Perry Barlow</a>, who would become his most frequent lyricist.

	</p>




<p>
	Weir began playing guitar at 13 and was soon hanging out at the Tangent, a Palo Alto folk club, where he performed bluegrass numbers with the Uncalled Four and first saw Garcia playing banjo during a “hoot” night. Weir picked up his first guitar licks from David Nelson and future Jefferson Airplane member Jorma Kaukonen.</p>

	On New Year’s Eve, 1965, Weir and his friends heard banjo music emerging from Dana Morgan’s Music Store. He went in and found Garcia, and the two decided to form a band. The acoustic Mother McCree’s Uptown Jug Champions evolved into the electric Warlocks, who changed their name to the Grateful Dead.

<p>
	As the youngest and best-looking member of the Dead, Weir had to pay some dues. Weir admitted that too much LSD during the group’s stint as house band for Ken Kesey’s Acid Tests made him withdrawn, especially as Garcia and bassist Phil Lesh were uniting more musically. “I was definitely low man on the totem pole,” he told <em>Rolling Stone</em> in 1989, “especially at the beginning. And for a long time I had to just shut up and take it.”</p>

<p>
	The lyrics to “The Other One” described Weir’s introduction to both LSD and Neal Cassady, the trickster hero of Jack Kerouac’s beat-generation masterpiece <em>On the Road</em>, with whom Weir shared a room in the Dead’s infamous 710 Ashbury Street house. In 1968, Weir and fellow founding member Ron “Pigpen” McKernan were booted from the band for their musical deficiencies, though both returned within months.</p>



<p>
	Throughout the Seventies, Weir thrived as a member of a band that could deliver music of nearly ineffable warmth and country-rock majesty – as on their pair of 1970 masterpieces, <em>Workingman’s Dead</em> and <em>American Beauty</em> – while also playing more freely improvised music to countless listeners. Weir sang the band’s country covers and his own material, and played rhythm guitar in a brilliantly eccentric manner that belied the job’s second-string implications – even while soundman Dan Healy was turning him down in the mix. Lesh described Weir’s technique as “quirky, whimsical and goofy,” while Weir claimed jazz pianist McCoy Tyner’s left hand as his greatest influence.

<p>
	With Pigpen’s death in 1972, Weir stepped into the second-vocalist role smoothly. <em>Ace</em>, his first solo album, established him as the band’s second most fruitful songwriting source with solo songs-turned-Dead standards like “Playing in the Band,” “One More Saturday Night,” and “Cassidy.”

	</p>

</div></figure>



<p>
	Usually alternating lead vocals with Garcia, he developed a repertoire that ranged from country-rock originals and rhythmically unorthodox tunes to his ambitious and gorgeous “Weather Report Suite.” He also began gigging outside the Dead with a vatiety of acts: First with Kingfish in 1974, then forming the Bob Weir Band with keyboardist Brent Mydland – who later joined the Dead – in the late Seventies. (They’d go on to release two albums with Bobby and the Midnites in the Eighties.) His second solo album, 1978’s <em>Heaven Help the Fool</em>, proved he could sound as slick as any other California rocker.</p>



<p>
	Over the course of the Eighties, Weir would have to compensate onstage as Garcia sank into drug addiction – and later admitted that he also sometimes served as “bag man” for the guitarist’s drugs. Garcia temporarily recovered toward the end of the decade, an era Weir lauded as the Dead’s finest. “For me, that was our peak,” he told <em>Rolling Stone</em> in 2013. “We could hear and feel each other thinking, and we could intuit each other’s moves. Jerry, Brent, and I reached new plateaus as singers. We packed a punch.”</p>

</div></figure>



<p>
	Though hit hard by Garcia’s August 1995 death, Weir continued to perform; as he famously sang in one Dead classic, “The Music Never Stopped.” His band RatDog played his Dead material and originals, and Weir eventually began singing Garcia’s own material in various 21st-century configurations of former Grateful Dead members, including the Other Ones, the Dead, and Furthur. After collapsing onstage with Furthur in 2013 and canceling RatDog performances in 2014, Weir admitted that he struggled with his own addiction to painkillers.</p>



<p>
	As the remaining Grateful Dead members approached their golden anniversary in 2015, Weir was the first to support a reunion, telling <em>Rolling Stone</em>, “If there are issues we have to get past, I think that we owe it to ourselves to man up and get past them. If there are hatchets to be buried, then let’s get to work. Let’s start digging.”</p>



<p>
	Following the surviving members’ Fare Thee Well concerts celebrating the Grateful Dead’s 50th anniversary in 2015, Weir enlisted one of the gig’s guests, John Mayer, to join him, Mickey Hart, Bill Kreutzmann and other Dead associates in the new offshoot Dead &amp; Company. That group would keep the spirit of the Dead alive for another decade, culminating in a 2023 “Final Tour” and two stints at Las Vegas’ Sphere.

	</p>




<p>
	“We speak a language that nobody else speaks,” Weir <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/bobby-weir-grateful-dead-company-interview-1235290296/">told <em>Rolling Stone</em></a> last March. “We communicate, we kick stuff back and forth, and then make our little statement in a more universal language. For us, it’s a look or a motion with one shoulder, or the way you reflect a phrase or something that tips off the other guys where you’re going with this. And then they work on being where you’re headed, getting there with a little surprise for you. That’s a formula that’s worked real well for us over the years, and there just aren’t enough of us left now to do that anymore.”</p>



<p>
	Weir’s third and final solo studio album, <em>Blue Mountain</em>, arrived in 2016. Two years later, the guitarist embarked on yet another musical project as Bobby Weir and Wolf Bros, alongside bassist/producer Don Was and drummer Jay Lane.</p>



<p>
	In December 2024, shortly after the <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/phil-lesh-grateful-dead-dead-1234809976/">death of Dead bassist Phil Lesh</a>, the Grateful Dead’s surviving members were recipients of the Kennedy Center honors. Dead &amp; Company marked the Grateful Dead’s 60th anniversary with a three-night stand at San Francisco’s Golden Gate Park in August. Those concerts marked Weir’s final performances, ending his “long strange trip” onstage.

	“Bobby’s final months reflected the same spirit that defined his life. Diagnosed in July, he began treatment only weeks before returning to his hometown stage for a three-night celebration of 60 years of music at Golden Gate Park. Those performances, emotional, soulful, and full of light, were not farewells, but gifts. Another act of resilience,” Weir’s family added in their statement. </p>

	“There is no final curtain here, not really. Only the sense of someone setting off again. He often spoke of a 300-year legacy, determined to ensure the songbook would endure long after him. May that dream live on through future generations of Dead Heads<strong>.</strong>&nbsp;And so we send him off the way he sent so many of us on our way: with a farewell that isn’t an ending, but a blessing. A reward for a life worth livin’.”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td><div><p><i>TLDR:</i> Librario is a book metadata API that aggregates data from Google Books, ISBNDB, and Hardcover into a single response, solving the problem of no single source having complete book information. It's currently pre-alpha, AGPL-licensed, and available to try now[0].</p><p>My wife and I have a personal library with around 1,800 books. I started working on a library management tool for us, but I quickly realized I needed a source of data for book information, and none of the solutions available provided all the data I needed. One might provide the series, the other might provide genres, and another might provide a good cover, but none provided everything.</p><p>So I started working on Librario, a book metadata aggregation API written in Go. It fetches information about books from multiple sources (Google Books, ISBNDB, Hardcover. Working on Goodreads and Anna's Archive next.), merges everything, and saves it all to a PostgreSQL database for future lookups. The idea is that the database gets stronger over time as more books are queried.</p><p>You can see an example response here[1], or try it yourself:</p><pre><code>  curl -s -H 'Authorization: Bearer librario_ARbmrp1fjBpDywzhvrQcByA4sZ9pn7D5HEk0kmS34eqRcaujyt0enCZ' \
  'https://api.librario.dev/v1/book/9781328879943' | jq .
  </code></pre><p>
This is pre-alpha and runs on a small VPS, so keep that in mind. I never hit the limits in the third-party services, so depending on how this post goes, I’ll or will not find out if the code handles that well.</p><p>The merger is the heart of the service, and figuring out how to combine conflicting data from different sources was the hardest part. In the end I decided to use field-specific strategies which are quite naive, but work for now.</p><p>Each extractor has a priority, and results are sorted by that priority before merging. But priority alone isn't enough, so different fields need different treatment.</p><p>For example:</p><p>- Titles use a scoring system. I penalize titles containing parentheses or brackets because sources sometimes shove subtitles into the main title field. Overly long titles (80+ chars) also get penalized since they often contain edition information or other metadata that belongs elsewhere.</p><p>- Covers collect all candidate URLs, then a separate fetcher downloads and scores them by dimensions and quality. The best one gets stored locally and served from the server.</p><p>For most other fields (publisher, language, page count), I just take the first non-empty value by priority. Simple, but it works.</p><p>Recently added a caching layer[2] which sped things up nicely. I considered migrating from <i>net/http</i> to <i>fiber</i> at some point[3], but decided against it. Going outside the standard library felt wrong, and the migration didn't provide much in the end.</p><p>The database layer is being rewritten before v1.0[4]. I'll be honest: the original schema was written by AI, and while I tried to guide it in the right direction with SQLC[5] and good documentation, database design isn't my strong suit and I couldn't confidently vouch for the code. Rather than ship something I don't fully understand, I hired the developers from SourceHut[6] to rewrite it properly.</p><p>I've got a 5-month-old and we're still adjusting to their schedule, so development is slow. I've mentioned this project in a few HN threads before[7], so I’m pretty happy to finally have something people can try.</p><p>Code is AGPL and on SourceHut[8].</p><p>Feedback and patches[9] are very welcome :)</p><p>[0]: <a href="https://sr.ht/~pagina394/librario/" rel="nofollow">https://sr.ht/~pagina394/librario/</a></p><p>[1]: <a href="https://paste.sr.ht/~jamesponddotco/a6c3b1130133f384cffd25b33a8ab1bc3392093c" rel="nofollow">https://paste.sr.ht/~jamesponddotco/a6c3b1130133f384cffd25b3...</a></p><p>[2]: <a href="https://todo.sr.ht/~pagina394/librario/16" rel="nofollow">https://todo.sr.ht/~pagina394/librario/16</a></p><p>[3]: <a href="https://todo.sr.ht/~pagina394/librario/13" rel="nofollow">https://todo.sr.ht/~pagina394/librario/13</a></p><p>[4]: <a href="https://todo.sr.ht/~pagina394/librario/14" rel="nofollow">https://todo.sr.ht/~pagina394/librario/14</a></p><p>[5]: <a href="https://sqlc.dev/" rel="nofollow">https://sqlc.dev</a></p><p>[6]: <a href="https://sourcehut.org/consultancy/" rel="nofollow">https://sourcehut.org/consultancy/</a></p><p>[7]: <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45419234">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45419234</a></p><p>[8]: <a href="https://sr.ht/~pagina394/librario/" rel="nofollow">https://sr.ht/~pagina394/librario/</a></p><p>[9]: <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~pagina394/librario/tree/trunk/item/CONTRIBUTING.md" rel="nofollow">https://git.sr.ht/~pagina394/librario/tree/trunk/item/CONTRI...</a></p></div></td></div></div>]]></description>

      <p><strong>PROVIDENCE, R.I.</strong> [Brown University] — Private equity firms acquired more than 500 autism therapy centers across the U.S. over the past decade, with nearly 80% of acquisitions occurring over a four-year span.</p><p>That’s according to a new study from researchers at Brown University’s <a href="https://cahpr.sph.brown.edu/">Center for Advancing Health Policy through Research</a>.</p><p>Study author Yashaswini Singh, a health economist at Brown’s School of Public Health, said the work highlights how financial firms are rapidly moving into a sensitive area of health care with little public scrutiny or data on where this is happening or why.</p><p>“The big takeaway is that there is yet another segment of health care that has emerged as potentially profitable to private equity investors, and it is very distinct from where we have traditionally known investors to go, so the potential for harm can be a lot more serious,” Singh said. “We're also dealing with children who are largely insured by Medicaid programs, so if private equity increases the intensity of care, what we're looking at are impacts to state Medicaid budgets down the road.”</p><p>The findings were <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/article-abstract/2843100?resultClick=1" data-entity-type="external">published</a> in JAMA Pediatrics and offer one of the first national assessments of private equity’s growing role in autism therapies and services. Autism diagnoses among U.S. children have risen sharply in recent years, nearly tripling between 2011 and 2022, and autism has been in the national spotlight amid political debate claiming links between autism and childhood vaccines.</p><p>The findings suggest that investment has been concentrated in states with higher rates of autism diagnoses among children and states that have fewer limits on insurance coverage.</p><p>The researchers identified a total of 574 autism therapy centers owned by private equity firms as of 2024, spanning 42 states. Most of those centers were acquired between 2018 and 2022, the result of 142 separate deals. The largest concentrations of centers were in California (97), Texas (81), Colorado (38), Illinois (36) and Florida (36). Sixteen states had one or no private equity-owned clinics at the end of 2024.</p><p>States in the top third for childhood autism prevalence were 24% more likely to have private equity–owned clinics than others, according to the study.</p><p>The scale and speed of acquisitions underscore the growing trend of private equity’s entry into the market, the researchers say. According to Singh, the team was prompted to investigate that trend after hearing anecdotal reports from families and health providers about changes following private equity takeovers.</p><p>The primary concern is that private equity firms may prioritize financial gains over families, said Daniel Arnold, a senior research scientist at the School of Public Health.</p><p>“It's all about the financial incentives,” Arnold said. “I worry about the same types of revenue-generating strategies seen in other private equity-backed settings. I worry about children receiving more than the clinically appropriate amount of services and worsening disparities in terms of which children have access to services.”</p><p>To establish a baseline of where private equity firms are investing and why, the team used a mix of proprietary databases, public press releases and manual verification of archived websites to track changes in ownership. Unlike public companies, private equity firms and private practices are not required to disclose acquisitions, making data collection challenging and labor-intensive.</p><p>The team is now seeking federal funding to examine how private equity ownership affects outcomes, including changes in therapy intensity, medication use, diagnosis age or how long children stay in treatment. They seek to determine whether these investments are helping to meet real needs or are primarily a way to make money.</p><p>“Private investors making a little bit of money while expanding access is not a bad thing, per se,” Singh said. “But we need to understand how much of a bad thing this is and how much of a good thing this is. This is a first step in that direction.”</p><p>This study received funding from the National Institute on Aging (R01AG073286) and the National Institute on Mental Health (R01MH132128).</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-id="4189490c" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="theme-post-content.default">
					<p>By now, we’ve all heard the familiar refrain: “It’s for your safety.” It’s the soothing mantra of every government official who’s ever wanted a peek behind your digital curtains.</p>
<p>This week, with a move that would make East Germany blush, the UK government officially confirmed its intention to hand Ofcom&nbsp; (yes, that Ofcom, the regulator that once investigated whether Love Island was too spicy) the keys to your private messages.</p>
<p>The country, already experiencing rapidly declining civil liberties, is now planning to scan encrypted chats for “bad stuff.”</p>
<p>Now, for those unfamiliar, Ofcom is the UK’s communications regulator that has recently been given <a href="https://reclaimthenet.org/uk-tech-secretary-presses-ofcom-fast-track-online-safety-act">censorship pressure powers for online speech</a>.</p>
<p>It’s become the government’s Swiss Army knife for everything from internet censorship to now, apparently, full-blown surveillance.</p>
<p>Under the <a href="https://reclaimthenet.org/uk-online-safety-act-strategic-priorities-ofcom-censorship-surveillance-age-verification">Online Safety Act</a>, Ofcom has been handed something called Section 121, which sounds like a tax loophole but is actually a legal crowbar for prying open encrypted messages.</p>
<p>It allows the regulator to compel any online service that lets people talk to each other, Facebook Messenger, Signal, iMessage, etc to install “accredited technology” to scan for terrorism or child abuse material.</p>
<p><strong>More:&nbsp;<a href="https://reclaimthenet.org/uk-government-encrypted-icloud-access-order-apple-privacy-surveillance">Starmer Adds To UK Civil Liberties Decline With Reckless iCloud Backdoor Demand</a></strong></p>
<p>The way this works is by scanning all your messages. Not just the suspicious ones. Not just the flagged ones. Every single message. On your device. Before they’re encrypted.</p>
<p>This is “client-side scanning,” which is a clever euphemism for “we’re turning your phone into a government informant.”</p>
<p>Let’s be clear about what’s at stake. End-to-end encryption is what keeps your private messages private.</p>
<p>But the UK’s plan effectively makes that encryption irrelevant. If the message gets scanned before it’s encrypted, the whole thing is about as useful as putting a padlock on a door that’s already wide open.</p>
<p>This isn’t some consequence. This is the point.</p>
<p>Lord Hanson of Flint, the man chosen to deliver this particularly Orwellian update in the House of Lords, confirmed that Ofcom is expected to start using these powers just as soon as it finishes its report.</p>
<p>“We have set a date of April 2026,” he said, presumably while polishing his best ‘nothing to see here’ smile, “and we expect to act extremely speedily once we have had the report back.”</p>
<p>Baroness Butler-Sloss, clearly tired of waiting for this dystopia to arrive on schedule, pushed for Ofcom to get on with it. “Work to do this now,” she said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Baroness Berger popped up to promote something called “upload prevention technology.” It sounds like an antivirus program crossed with a puritanical school principal, and she claimed it can stop harmful content before it spreads. Lovely idea. Also, exactly how Chinese censorship works.</p>
<p>She also accused tech companies of lying when they say scanning encrypted messages isn’t possible. And maybe they are. But when your answer to that is “Well, we’ll just force them to comply by law,” you’re not solving the problem. You’re building a digital panopticon with the grace of a sledgehammer.</p>
<p>Here’s the problem. Once you install the infrastructure to scan for one kind of content, however vile, it’s there forever. And that tool, like every government tool, will be “repurposed.”</p>
<p>It starts with child abuse material, because who’s going to defend not catching that? Then maybe a few terrorist memes. Then maybe “hate speech.” Then “misinformation.” Then a joke about the</p>
<p>Prime Minister’s haircut. And suddenly, you’re far from a democracy.</p>
<p>You’re just renting space in an open-air digital prison where your every word is silently filed away in a database next to your Amazon shopping history and that one embarrassing search from 2013.</p>
<p>We’ve been yelling about this for years. You cannot build a scanning system that only finds “the bad stuff.”</p>
<p>The government is playing the long game. Ofcom will issue its report by April 2026, followed by a “consultation,” which, let’s be honest, only ever goes one way, and then the Home Office will act “extremely speedily,” whatever that means in bureaucratic time.</p>
<p>What’s certain is this: if they get their way, private messaging in the UK will be gone.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A few months ago, users started reporting that Ghostty was consuming absurd
amounts of memory, with one user reporting <strong>37 GB</strong> after 10 days of uptime.
Today, I'm happy to say <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/10251">the fix has been found and merged</a>.
This post is an overview of what caused the leak, a look at some of
Ghostty's internals, and some brief descriptions of how we tracked it down.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-2" id="user-content-fnref-2" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup></p>
<p>The leak was present since at least Ghostty 1.0, but it is only recently
that popular CLI applications (particularly Claude Code) started producing
the correct conditions to trigger it at scale. The limited conditions that
triggered the leak are what made it particularly tricky to diagnose.</p>
<p>The fix is merged and is available in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ghostty.org/docs/install/pre">tip/nightly releases</a>,
and will be part of the tagged 1.3 release in March.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-pagelist">The PageList</h2>
<p>To understand the bug, we first need to understand how Ghostty manages
terminal memory. Ghostty uses a data structure called the
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/blob/main/src/terminal/PageList.zig"><code>PageList</code></a>
to store terminal content. PageList is a doubly-linked list of
memory pages that store the terminal content (characters, styles, hyperlinks,
etc.).</p>
<div><p>PageList: A doubly-linked list of memory pages</p><div><p><span>Page 1</span><span>oldest</span><span>scrollback</span></p><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none"><path d="M1 8h20m0 0l-4-4m4 4l-4 4" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"></path><path d="M23 16H3m0 0l4-4m-4 4l4 4" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"></path></svg><p><span>Page 2</span></p><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none"><path d="M1 8h20m0 0l-4-4m4 4l-4 4" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"></path><path d="M23 16H3m0 0l4-4m-4 4l4 4" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"></path></svg><p><span>Page 3</span></p><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none"><path d="M1 8h20m0 0l-4-4m4 4l-4 4" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"></path><path d="M23 16H3m0 0l4-4m-4 4l4 4" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"></path></svg><p><span>Page 4</span><span>newest</span><span>active screen</span></p></div></div>
<p>The underlying "pages" are not single <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_(computer_memory)">virtual memory pages</a>
but they are a contiguous block of memory aligned to page boundaries
and composed of an even multiple of system pages.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-1" id="user-content-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup></p>
<p>These pages are allocated using <code>mmap</code>. <code>mmap</code> isn't particularly fast,
so to avoid constant syscalls, we use a <strong>memory pool</strong>. When we need
a new page, we pull from the pool. When we're done with a page, we return
it to the pool for reuse.</p>
<p>The pool uses a <strong>standard size</strong> for pages. Think of it like buying
standard-sized shipping boxes: most things people ship fit in a standard box,
and having a standard box comes with various efficiencies.</p>
<p>But sometimes terminals need more memory than a standard page provides.
If a set of lines has many emoji, styles, or hyperlinks, we need
a larger page. In these cases, we allocate a <strong>non-standard page</strong>
directly with <code>mmap</code>, bypassing the pool entirely. This is typically a
rare scenario.</p>
<div><p>Two types of page allocations</p><div><div><p>Standard Pages (from pool)</p><div><p>• Fixed size</p><p>• Returned to pool when freed</p><p>• Reusable for future allocations</p></div></div><div><p>Non-Standard Pages (direct mmap)</p><div><p>• Variable size (larger than standard)</p><p>• Must call munmap to free</p><p>• Cannot be reused</p></div></div></div></div>
<p>When we "free" a page, we apply some simple logic:</p>
<ol>
<li>If the page is <code>&lt;= standard size</code>: return it to the pool</li>
<li>If the page is <code>&gt; standard size</code>: call <code>munmap</code> to free it</li>
</ol>
<p>This is the core background for terminal memory management in Ghostty,
and the idea itself is sound. A logic bug around an optimization is
what produced the leak, as we'll see next.</p>
<hr>

<p>There's one more background detail we need to cover to
understand the bug: scrollback pruning.</p>
<p>Ghostty has a <code>scrollback-limit</code> configuration that caps how much history
is retained. When you hit this limit, we delete the oldest pages in
the scrollback buffer to free up memory.</p>
<p>But this often happens in a super hot path (e.g. when outputting large
amounts of data quickly), and allocating and freeing memory pages is
expensive, even with the pool. Therefore, we have an optimization:
<strong>reuse the oldest page as the newest page</strong> when we reach the limit.</p>
<div><p>Scrollback pruning: reusing the oldest page</p><div><div><p>Before: at scrollback limit</p></div><div><svg fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M19 14l-7 7m0 0l-7-7m7 7V3"></path></svg><p><span>Remove from front, reuse at back</span></p></div><div><p>After: page reused at end</p><div><p><span>Page 2</span><span>now oldest</span></p><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none"><path d="M1 8h20m0 0l-4-4m4 4l-4 4" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"></path><path d="M23 16H3m0 0l4-4m-4 4l4 4" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"></path></svg><p><span>Page 3</span></p><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none"><path d="M1 8h20m0 0l-4-4m4 4l-4 4" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"></path><path d="M23 16H3m0 0l4-4m-4 4l4 4" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"></path></svg><p><span>Page 4</span></p><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none"><path d="M1 8h20m0 0l-4-4m4 4l-4 4" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"></path><path d="M23 16H3m0 0l4-4m-4 4l4 4" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"></path></svg></div></div></div></div>
<p>This optimization works great. It requires zero allocations and uses
only some quick pointer manipulations to move the page from the
front to the back of the list. We do some metadata cleanup to "clear" the
page but otherwise leave the previous memory intact.</p>
<p>It's fast and empirically speeds up scrollback-heavy workloads significantly.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-bug">The Bug</h2>
<p>During the scrollback pruning optimization, we always
<strong>resized our page back to standard size</strong>. But we didn't resize the
underlying memory allocation itself, we only noted the resize in the
metadata. The underlying memory was still the large
non-standard <code>mmap</code> allocation, but now the PageList <em>thought</em> it was standard
sized.</p>
<div><p>How metadata desync causes the leak</p><div><div><p>1</p><div><p>Allocate non-standard page</p></div></div><div><p>2</p><div><p>Scrollback prunes &amp; reuses</p><p><strong>BUG:</strong> metadata reset to std_size, but mmap unchanged!</p></div></div><div><p>3</p><div><p>Free the page</p><p>std_size, assume pooled. <strong>munmap never called!</strong></p></div></div><div><p><span><span></span>Standard</span><span><span></span>Non-standard</span><span><span></span>Leaked</span></p></div></div></div>
<p>Eventually, we'd free the page under various circumstances (e.g. when
the user closes the terminal, but also other times). At that point,
we'd see the page memory was within the standard size, assume it
was part of the pool, and we would <em>never call <code>munmap</code></em> on it.
A classic leak.</p>
<p>This all seems pretty obvious, but the issue is that non-standard
pages are rare by design. The goal of our design and optimizations is
that standard pages are the common case and provide a fast-path. Only
very specific scenarios produce non-standard pages and they're usually
not produced in large quantities.</p>
<p>But the rise of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://claude.com/product/claude-code">Claude Code</a>
changed this. For some reason, Claude Code's CLI produces a lot of
multi-codepoint grapheme outputs which force Ghostty to regularly
use non-standard pages. Additionally, Claude Code uses the primary screen
and produces a significant amount of scrollback output. These things
combined together created the perfect storm to trigger the leak
in huge quantities.</p>
<div><p>I want to be explicit that this bug is not Claude Code's fault. Claude Code is simply exercising
Ghostty in a way that exposes this long-standing bug.</p></div>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-fix">The Fix</h2>
<p>The fix is conceptually simple: <strong>never reuse non-standard pages</strong>.
If we encounter a non-standard page during scrollback pruning, we
destroy it properly (calling <code>munmap</code>) and allocate a fresh
standard-sized page from the pool.</p>
<p>The core of the fix is in the snippet below, but some extra
work was needed to fix up some other bits of accounting we have:</p>
<div><pre><code><span><span>if</span> <span>(</span>first<span>.</span>data<span>.</span>memory<span>.</span>len <span>&gt;</span> std_size<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
</span><span>    self<span>.</span><span>destroyNode</span><span>(</span>first<span>)</span><span>;</span>
</span><span>    <span>break</span> <span>:</span><span>prune</span><span>;</span>
</span><span><span>}</span>
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We could've also reused the non-standard page and just retained the
large memory size, but until we have data that shows otherwise, we're
still operating under the assumption that standard pages are the common case
and it makes sense to reset back to a standard pooled page.</p>
<p>Other users have recommended more complex strategies (e.g. maintaining
some metrics on how often non-standard pages are used and adjusting
our assumptions accordingly), but more research is needed before
making those changes. This change is simple, fixes the bug, and aligns
with our current assumptions.</p>
<hr>

<p>As part of the fix, I added support for virtual memory tags on macOS
provided by the Mach kernel. This lets us tag our PageList memory allocations
with a specific identifier that shows up in various tooling.</p>
<div><pre><code><span><span>inline</span> <span>fn</span> <span>pageAllocator</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>Allocator</span> <span>{</span>
</span><span>    <span>// In tests we use our testing allocator so we can detect leaks.</span>
</span><span>    <span>if</span> <span>(</span>builtin<span>.</span>is_test<span>)</span> <span>return</span> std<span>.</span>testing<span>.</span>allocator<span>;</span>
</span><span>
</span><span>    <span>// On non-macOS we use our standard Zig page allocator.</span>
</span><span>    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span>builtin<span>.</span>target<span>.</span>os<span>.</span>tag<span>.</span><span>isDarwin</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span> <span>return</span> std<span>.</span>heap<span>.</span>page_allocator<span>;</span>
</span><span>
</span><span>    <span>// On macOS we want to tag our memory so we can assign it to our</span>
</span><span>    <span>// core terminal usage.</span>
</span><span>    <span>const</span> mach <span>=</span> <span>@import</span><span>(</span><span>"../os/mach.zig"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</span><span>    <span>return</span> mach<span>.</span><span>taggedPageAllocator</span><span>(</span><span>.</span>application_specific_1<span>)</span><span>;</span>
</span><span><span>}</span>
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now when debugging memory on macOS, Ghostty's PageList memory shows up
with a specific tag instead of being lumped in with everything else.
This made it trivial to identify the leak, associate it with the PageList,
and also verify that the fix worked by observing the tagged memory
being properly freed.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="preventing-leaks-in-ghostty">Preventing Leaks in Ghostty</h2>
<p>We do a lot of work in the Ghostty project to find and prevent memory leaks:</p>
<ul>
<li>In debug builds and unit tests, we use leak-detecting Zig allocators.</li>
<li>The CI runs <code>valgrind</code> on our full unit test suite on every commit
to find more than just leaks, such as undefined memory usage.</li>
<li>We regularly run the macOS GUI via macOS Instruments to look for
leaks particularly in the Swift codebase.</li>
<li>We run every GTK-related PR using Valgrind (the full GUI) to look
for leaks in the GTK codepath that isn't unit tested.</li>
</ul>
<p>This has worked really well to date, but unfortunately it didn't catch
this particular leak because it only triggers under very specific
conditions that our tests didn't reproduce. The merged PR includes a
test that does reproduce the leak to prevent regressions in the future.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This was the largest known memory leak in Ghostty to date, and the only
reported leak that has been confirmed by more than a single user.
We'll continue to monitor and address memory reports as they come in,
but remember that reproduction is the key to diagnosing and fixing memory leaks!</p>
<p>Big thanks to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/grishy">@grishy</a> who finally
got me a reliable reproduction so I could analyze the issue myself. Their
own analysis reached the same conclusion as mine, and the reproduction
let me verify both our understandings independently.</p>
<p>Thanks also to everyone who reported this issue with detailed diagnostics.
The community's analysis, especially around the <code>footprint</code> output and
VM region counting, gave me important clues that pointed toward the PageList
as the culprit.</p>

<p><a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind Labs</a> laid off 75% of its engineering team last week.</p>
<p>Adam Wathan, CEO of Tailwind Labs, spent the holidays running revenue forecasts. In a <a href="https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss.com/pull/2388#issuecomment-3717222957">GitHub comment</a>, he explained what happened:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The reality is that 75% of the people on our engineering team lost their jobs here yesterday because of the brutal impact AI has had on our business. Traffic to our docs is down about 40% from early 2023 despite Tailwind being more popular than ever.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The story circulating is that AI is killing Open Source businesses. I don't think that is quite right.</p>
<p>AI didn't kill Tailwind's business. It stress tested it. Their business model failed the test, but that is not an indictment of all Open Source business models.</p>
<p>Tailwind's business model worked for years. It relied on developers visiting their documentation, discovering Tailwind Plus while browsing, and buying it. Tailwind Plus is a $299 collection of pre-built UI components. Traffic led to discovery, and discovery drove sales. It was a reasonable business model, but always fragile.</p>
<p>In the last year, more and more developers started asking AI for code instead of reading documentation, and their sales and marketing funnel broke.</p>
<p>There is a fairness issue here that I don't want to skip past. AI companies trained their models on Tailwind's documentation and everything the community wrote about it. And now those models generate Tailwind code and answer Tailwind questions without sending anyone to Tailwind's website. The value got extracted, but <a href="https://dri.es/the-webs-broken-deal-with-ai-companies">compensation isn't flowing back</a>. That bothers me, and it deserves a broader policy conversation.</p>
<p>What I keep coming back to is this: AI commoditizes anything you can fully <em>specify</em>. Documentation, pre-built card components, a CSS library, Open Source plugins. Tailwind's commercial offering was built on "specifications". AI made those things trivial to generate. AI can ship a specification but it can't run a business.</p>
<p>So where does value live now? In what requires showing up, not just specifying. Not what you can specify once, but what requires showing up again and again.</p>
<p>Value is shifting to operations: deployment, testing, rollbacks, observability. You can't prompt 99.95% uptime on Black Friday. Neither can you prompt your way to keeping a site secure, updated, and running.</p>
<p>That is why <a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a> created <a href="https://nextjs.org/">Next.js</a> and gives it away for free. The Open Source framework is the conduit; the hosting is the product. Same with <a href="https://www.acquia.com/">Acquia</a>, my own company. A big part of Acquia's business model is selling products around <a href="https://www.drupal.org/">Drupal</a>: hosting, search, CI/CD pipelines, digital asset management, and more. We don't sell describable things; we sell operations.</p>
<p>Open Source was never the commercial product. It's the conduit to something else.</p>
<p>When asked what to pivot to, Wathan was candid: "Still to this day, I don't know what we should be pivoting to". I've written about <a href="https://dri.es/ai-and-the-great-digital-agency-unbundling">how digital agencies might evolve</a>, but CSS frameworks and component libraries are a harder case. Some Open Source projects make for great features, but not great businesses.</p>
<p>Tailwind CSS powers millions of sites. The framework will survive. Whether the company does is a different question. I'm rooting for them. The world needs more successful Open Source businesses.</p>

For this first time, this allows for drones with infinite range. Removing battery swaps is the last step to deploy UAVs autonomously at scale. After building drones for the Air Force and DARPA, Ronan realized this was both practical and technically feasible.

Power utilities are the perfect first customer. Drone inspections identify maintenance concerns before they cause faults. Faults cause power outages, and spark wildfires - like the Eaton Fire in early 2025 where 19 people lost their lives and nearly 10,000 structures were destroyed. Fires bankrupt utilities and make them uninsurable. Autonomous drones can deliver over 20x the inspection coverage for the same cost.

Since June, we’ve validated our core charging tech on a power line, built 5x flying prototypes, and inspected ~2000 poles.

After power companies, we will service rail, road, telecom, real estate and other inspection markets. Insurance and grid traders also want our data product. At scale we are a new infrastructure layer for data on the physical world.</p></div><section><p>YC Photos</p></section><div><div><p>San Francisco, CA, US</p><p>$3.5K - $8.5K / monthly</p><p>Sophomore and above</p></div><div><p>San Francisco, CA, US</p><p>$100K - $180K</p><p>0.50% - 2.00%</p><p>1+ years</p></div><div><p>San Francisco, CA, US</p><p>$4K - $6K / monthly</p><p>Junior and above</p></div><div><p>San Francisco, CA, US</p><p>$100K - $200K</p><p>0.50% - 2.00%</p><p>1+ years</p></div><div><p>San Francisco, CA, US / Boise, ID, US</p><p>$100K - $180K</p><p>0.50% - 2.00%</p><p>1+ years</p></div></div></div><div><p><a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/voltair" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://bookface-images.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/logos/e97e6efd2a97cc7953ba73292bdc2316db9c078e.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQC4NIECANBGSGFLB%2F20260110%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Date=20260110T213001Z&amp;X-Amz-Expires=3600&amp;X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEP3%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJIMEYCIQDSbQaZPApMd7QNbpmzkBXelWwg1mCMU91PlmbKS8x%2FUAIhANSb60li4RuZpTW0AqR3xP09Y34nZ9qsQFv%2BeAFakkaYKu4DCMb%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEQABoMMDA2MjAxODExMDcyIgwgPS%2BY8PSwe8Vp82UqwgO7P0chTBx59ZZL9N%2BSCL7d7tCc%2F69NBf3QVpshxp4inz%2F3Tul8fKQ5a7BoCqiEDJ6SeGzZkAAUxAQjq2AJPDsqxHeLsjN8MBE9zOesxxs%2BQC3zpkljaPQ1OrGAuXUotz0UtKpCJ3Ezyba5wWwQvSUJm1RLesQ9z2342V1NFSBw6XVKkCLJwOXPmxL5kIp8Z0moqjoYQEXX96l3LLvzTisxAqYvkGhd23k%2BjnpXCVo8%2FgFAnlNiYrVlB4i%2BaEWiE0%2BoxR0PTtxM%2Fs9E6Kcfjh14IXpz7GpXf383mJNRt4FCRixmwjbhVAcEnteC4M18k8bFyQyCcBLhlXaq3KdCNRRTBI3VyVqHQ1htvPwUFoUBsVLEU5hWgpEkv7LYXZZCC5wbnzgEDWAJy4zNI%2B8GmdmLfmu5Dr1m9mucYbCdmRzLWa%2B8jylW7Zfh82vTfvFFkIjOOO3tULs5vk6uunIju7H2U4XviUQPmfq7xNIGFOnb7JzCYCYidDgYcAMyWP1gJiEKawZEfY8pAl0fua%2FEqOzSUGd%2BZYZfEihq0ozc6Jm%2Bl6Q1zJf0kmFl%2BZoPUjrCGE86xqq1w%2FvewuDGkn5keT9x9Qgwg4KLywY6pAGcC2p6PCIL8jti0xi1yT5XK0jKyJR752tbETxYZtPxx7vYeaDUl1prSB4vtDnhSdxUpUGe3fr6mVZrcKqZyHrAKs9fA%2B9VJDt4fduHtgk%2FII3TqOkxhifug5TDHSPADPz98lyBUMLVr30nQbihQbQ%2B%2FGDpUDhqjJz6IX5qi5Jzy7i0Ue0GTXnKi0ZrYozMW51XvfZ49bzsiHMyinrp4kGWX1rPEw%3D%3D&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;X-Amz-Signature=ecf857612c711497d0de1c614cb1777d97a4a6cb2f52bdb753d1fcae65d0bdc8" alt="Voltair"></a></p><div><p><span>Founded:</span><span>2025</span></p><p><span>Batch:</span><span>Winter 2026</span></p><p><span>Team Size:</span><span>5</span></p><p><span>Status:</span><span>Active</span></p><p><span>Location:</span><span>San Francisco</span></p></div></div></div></div>]]></description>

Many believe it’s filled with unnecessary features that are difficult to disable. </p> <p>According to a recent test by YouTuber TrigzZolt, Windows 11 might actually be the slowest version of Windows released in the past 25 years — yes, even slower than the often-criticized Windows Vista.</p> <h2>A Slow Experience Despite Promises</h2> <figure><p> <iframe loading="lazy" title="Windows XP vs Vista vs 7 vs 8.1 vs 10 vs 11 | Speed Test" width="780" height="439" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/7VZJO-hOT4c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p><a href="https://www.eteknix.com/category/microsoft">Microsoft</a> promotes Windows 11 as its fastest operating system ever, but real-world tests tell a different story. In a detailed comparison, TrigzZolt benchmarked several Windows versions: XP, Vista, 7, 8.1, 10, and 11. The results showed that the newest version, Windows 11, performed the worst overall.</p> <p>The tests covered system boot time, laptop battery performance, application launch speed, memory management, and video editing capabilities. The benchmarks were run on a <a href="https://www.eteknix.com/category/lenovo">Lenovo</a> ThinkPad X220 — a model not officially compatible with Windows 11 — which could have affected some results. However, since the incompatibility mainly relates to hardware security rather than performance, the impact was likely minor.</p> <p>Among all the tested systems, Windows 11 was the slowest to start up, took the longest to open simple applications like Paint and File Explorer, and performed poorly when handling video editing in OpenShot. It also showed the highest <a href="https://www.eteknix.com/category/ram">RAM</a> usage when idle. Even without active applications, Windows 11 consumes significantly more memory due to its many background services and always-on features. Recently added AI functions have also contributed to slowing it down.</p> <p>The only areas where Windows 11 performed better were file transfer speed and storage space management for system applications. Overall, the conclusion was clear — Microsoft needs to lighten Windows 11, instead of filling it with more and more features that few users actually use.</p>  </div>     </article>  <div id="read-next-block"> <h2>Read Next</h2> <div id="tie-read-next"> <ul></ul> <div> <div> <p><span>1 hour ago</span></p> <h3>SanDisk Will Double the Price of Its Enterprise SSDs in 2026</h3> </div> <div> <p><span>1 hour ago</span></p> <h3>Epic Games Store Users Have Grown by 173% in Six Years, But Revenue Only by 1.6%</h3> </div> <div> <p><span>1 hour ago</span></p> <h3>Forza Horizon 5 Sells Over Five Million Copies on PS5</h3> </div> <div> <p><span>2 hours ago</span></p> <h3>Nintendo Switch Is About to Become the Second Best-Selling Console of All Time</h3> </div> <div> <p><span>8 hours ago</span></p> <h3>Steam Machine Appears on European Retail Listings Starting at $950</h3> </div> <div> <p><span>11 hours ago</span></p> <h3>DLSS 4.5 Boosts Visuals But Hurts Performance on RTX 30 and 20 GPUs</h3> </div> <div> <p><span>11 hours ago</span></p> <h3>Larian Studios Comments on Baldur’s Gate 3 Coming to Nintendo Switch 2</h3> </div> <div> <p><span>23 hours ago</span></p> <h3>Dawn of War Returns to Its Roots</h3> </div> <div> <p><span>23 hours ago</span></p> <h3>Gigabyte Breaks Records with World-First CQDIMM Technology</h3> </div> <div> <p><span>1 day ago</span></p> <h3>Intel Unveils Panther Lake for Handheld Gaming, Calls AMD Chips “Ancient Silicon”</h3> </div> <div> <p><span>1 day ago</span></p> <h3>Report: NVIDIA Delays RTX 50 SUPER Series Indefinitely Amid GDDR7 Memory Shortage</h3> </div> <div> <p><span>1 day ago</span></p> <h3>FromSoftware Acknowledges Online Issues in Elden Ring and Dark Souls on PC, Promises a Fix Soon</h3> </div> <div> <p><span>1 day ago</span></p> <h3>No Generative AI Will Be Used in the Development of Divinity, Larian Confirms</h3> </div> <div> <p><span>1 day ago</span></p> <h3>TSMC Beats Market Expectations with 20% Revenue Growth in Q4 2025, Driven by AI</h3> </div> <div> <p><span>1 day ago</span></p> <h3>Manor Lords Publisher Calls AI a “Cancer” and Refuses to Use It in His Games</h3> </div> <div> <p><span>1 day ago</span></p> <h3>Avowed Officially Coming to PlayStation 5, Release Date Confirmed</h3> </div> <div> <p><span>1 day ago</span></p> <h3>Sony Reveal Hyperpop DualSense Conntrollers and Console Covers</h3> </div> <div> <p><span>1 day ago</span></p> <h3>ASRock NUC Ultra 300 BOX Series Revealed</h3> </div> <div> <p><span>2 days ago</span></p> <h3>Detroit: Become Human Surpasses Another Major Sales Milestone</h3> </div> <div> <p><span>2 days ago</span></p> <h3>The PS2 Processor Once Raised Military Concerns, Says Final Fantasy IX Developer</h3> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Greetings from the year of Linux on my desktop.</p><p>In November, I got fed up and said <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/823337/switching-linux-gaming-desktop-cachyos">screw it, I’m installing Linux</a>. Since that article was published, I have dealt with one minor catastrophe after another. None of that has anything to do with Linux, mind you. It just meant I didn’t install it on my desktop until Sunday evening.</p><p>My goal here is to see how far I can get using Linux as my main OS <em>without</em> spending a ton of time futzing with it — or even much time researching beforehand. I am not looking for more high-maintenance hobbies at this stage. I want to see if Linux is a wingable alternative to Microsoft’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/821948/microsoft-windows-11-ai-agents-taskbar-integration">increasingly annoying OS</a>.</p><p>Honestly? So far it’s been fine. Many things I expected to be difficult — like getting my Nvidia graphics card working properly — were perfectly straightforward. A few things I thought would be simple weren’t. And I’ve run into one very funny issue with a gaming mouse that <em>only</em> works in games. But I’ve been able to use my Linux setup for work this week, I played exactly one video game, and I even printed something from my accursed printer.</p><div><p id="day-one"><h2>Day one</h2></p></div><div><p><a href="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/itworked.png?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0,0,100,100" data-pswp-height="1440" data-pswp-width="2560" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><img alt="Cachy splash screen showing the Hello window and a terminal" data-chromatic="ignore" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" sizes="(max-width: 639px) 100vw, (max-width: 1023px) 50vw, 700px" srcset="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/itworked.png?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=256 256w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/itworked.png?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=376 376w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/itworked.png?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=384 384w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/itworked.png?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=415 415w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/itworked.png?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=480 480w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/itworked.png?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=540 540w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/itworked.png?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=640 640w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/itworked.png?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=750 750w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/itworked.png?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=828 828w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/itworked.png?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=1080 1080w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/itworked.png?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=1200 1200w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/itworked.png?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=1440 1440w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/itworked.png?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=1920 1920w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/itworked.png?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=2048 2048w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/itworked.png?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=2400 2400w" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/itworked.png?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=2400"></a></p></div><p>I picked <a href="https://cachyos.org/">CachyOS</a> rather than a better-known distro like Ubuntu because it’s optimized for modern hardware, and I had heard that it’s easy to install and set up for gaming, which is one of the reasons I’d stuck with Windows for this long. After backing up my Windows image sometime in December (close enough), I follow the <a href="https://wiki.cachyos.org/installation/installation_on_root/">installation instructions in the Cachy wiki</a> and download the <a href="https://cachyos.org/">CachyOS</a> live image to a <a href="https://www.ventoy.net/en/index.html">Ventoy</a> USB drive, plug it into my PC, reboot into the BIOS to disable Secure Boot, reboot again into the Ventoy bootloader, and launch the CachyOS disk image.</p><p>First challenge: My mouse buttons don’t work. I can move the cursor, but can’t click on anything. I try plugging in a mouse (without unplugging the first one), same deal. Not a major issue; I can get around fine with just the keyboard. Maybe this is just an issue with the live image.</p><p>I launch the installer and am thrust into analysis paralysis. An operating system needs lots of little pieces to work — stuff you don’t even think of as individual components if you use Mac or Windows. How do you boot into the OS? What runs the desktop environment? How are windows drawn? What’s the file system? Where do you get software updates? In Mac and Windows, all those decisions are made for you. But Linux is fundamentally different: The core of the OS is the kernel, and everything else is kind of up to you. A distro is just somebody’s idea of what pieces to use. Some, like <a href="https://system76.com/pop/?srsltid=AfmBOoqaheiCcxLI9c_91oVN7uwiR6EIckpvCR9HWEN3781ua9N_u3E3">Pop_OS!</a> and <a href="https://linuxmint.com/">Mint</a>, aim for simplicity and make all those choices for you (though you can still change them if you want). But Cachy is based on <a href="https://archlinux.org/">Arch</a>, a notoriously DIY distro, and before I do anything else, I have to pick one of four bootloaders.

Sometimes you can just download them from a company’s website, or you get them from your distro’s official repositories, or GitHub, or wherever. There’s no official app store for Linux, but there are at least three projects aiming to provide universal Linux apps: Flatpak, AppImage, and Snap. Neat!

I reboot back into the Cachy live image and use the Parted utility to increase it to 1TB, then make a second btrfs partition in the remaining space. I reboot, log into Epic and GOG, and start downloading <em>The Outer Worlds</em>, a game from 2019 I’ve been playing a bit lately. It runs fine with Proton, and I can even sync my saves from the cloud. I play it for a few minutes with my trackball, remember I hate gaming on a trackball, and plug my gaming mouse back in. It works fine as long as I’m in the game, but outside the game, mouse clicks stop working again.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p><span>ANALYSIS</span> From May's <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/05/19/legal_aid_agency_data_theft/">cyberattack on the Legal Aid Agency</a> to the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/12/19/uk_foreign_office_hack/">Foreign Office breach</a> months later, cyber incidents have become increasingly common in UK government.</p>
<p>The scale extends far beyond these high-profile cases: the NCSC reports that 40 percent of attacks it managed between September 2020 and August 2021 targeted the public sector, a figure expected to grow.</p>
<p>Given this threat landscape, why does the UK's flagship Cyber Security and Resilience (CSR) Bill exclude both central and local government?</p>

    

<p>Sir Oliver Dowden, former digital secretary and current shadow deputy PM, led calls in the House of Commons this week urging Labour to rethink its stance on excluding central government from the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/11/12/uk_cyber_security_and_resilience/">Cyber Security and Resilience (CSR) Bill</a>.</p>

        


        

<p>"I would just urge the minister, as this bill passes through Parliament, to look again at that point, and I think there is a case for putting more stringent requirements on the public sector in order to force ministers' minds on that point."</p>
<p>The CSR bill was announced days into Sir Keir Starmer's tenure as Prime Minister, aiming to provide an essential refresh of the country's heavily outdated NIS 2018 regulations.</p>

        

<p>It proposed to bring managed service providers into scope, as was scheduled in 2022 before those plans fell by the wayside, and datacenters, among many other aspects.</p>
<p>Parallels can be drawn with the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/10/24/nis2_compliance_checklist/">EU's NIS2</a>. However, the CSR bill's scope is narrower, excluding public authorities, unlike the EU's equivalent regulatory refresh.</p>
<p>Ian Murray, minister of state across two government departments and responsible, in part, for data policy and public sector reform, thanked Dowden for his suggestions and promised to take them on board.</p>

        

<p>In responding to the shadow deputy PM, Murray also pointed to the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2026/01/06/government_cyber_action_plan/">Government Cyber Action Plan</a>, which it launched hours before the CSR bill was set for a second reading in the Commons.</p>
<p>This plan will ostensibly hold government departments to equal security standards as the CSR bill... just without any of the legal obligations.</p>
<p>Cynics may see it as a tool to quell any criticisms of the bill's scope not extending to central government, all without making any hard security commitments.</p>
<p>As Dowden noted in the Commons on Tuesday, cybersecurity is a matter that is often deprioritized quickly in government. "I welcome the minister's comments about the obligation on the public sector. However, I would caution him that, in my experience, cybersecurity is one of those things that ministers talk about but then other priorities overtake it. And the advantage of legislative requirements is that it forces ministers to think about it."</p>
<p>"I do think that more pressure needs to be brought to bear on ministers in terms of their accountability for cybersecurity. I fear that if we don't put this into primary legislation, it's something that can slip further and further down ministers' in-trays. Whilst [some] ministers may have a desire to address it, other, more pressing, immediate problems distract their attention."</p>
<p>One could argue that if the government is serious about holding itself to the same standards as the critical service providers in scope of the CSR bill, it would just bring itself and local authorities also into scope.</p>
<p>Neil Brown, director at British law firm decoded.legal, told <em>The Register</em>: "The argument is that government departments will be held to standards equivalent to those set out in the bill, and so do not need to be included. This does not fill me with confidence.</p>
<p>"If the government is going to hold itself to standards equivalent to those set out in the bill, then it has nothing to fear from being included in the bill since, by definition, it will be compliant."</p>
<p>Labour MP Matt Western, who also chairs the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/09/29/submarine_cable_security_report_uk/">National Security Strategy joint committee</a>, suggested that the CSR bill would not be a cure-all, but the first of many pieces of bespoke legislation the government will pass to improve national security.</p>
<p>This suggests the government is considering specific legislation to shore up public sector security further down the line. Perhaps this is wishful thinking.</p>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/07/30/uk_csr_bill_analysis/">Revamped UK cybersecurity bill couldn't come soon enough, but details are patchy</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Brown told us "separate legislation does not sound like a terrible idea," and notes that existing UK telecoms law is separated for effect.</p>
<p>The Telecommunications (Security) Act 2021 and the Product Security and Telecommunications Infrastructure Act 2022, for example, both seek to improve security in the telco space, but target different organizations. Security requirements often differ between types of organization, so potentially reserving a public sector-specific cybersecurity bill could be the way to go.</p>
<p>Ministers' plans also include a provision in the bill to introduce new legislative amendments as needed, to meet the demands of a rapidly shifting cybersecurity landscape, leaving behind the Brexit-related hindrances that delayed the previous NIS updates in the first place.</p>
<p>However, the likelihood of being able to deliver on effective legislative amendments at pace is uncertain.</p>
<p>Arguably, if the government wanted to do it correctly, it would carry out a comprehensive (and lengthy) industry consultation before pushing any amendments through the two Houses, another typically arduous process.</p>
<p>Whether this way of iterating on existing law could balance speed with comprehensiveness in unanswered.</p>
<p>For Brown, the approach taken by Labour – to legislate in smaller steps – seems like the smarter choice.</p>
<p>"My preference is to legislate little and often, iterating as needed, rather than trying to create one piece of legislation which is all things to all people," he says. "Legislation inevitably entails compromise, and often reflects the divergent interests of numerous interested parties (including lobbying groups) – I look, for instance, at the Online Safety Act 2023. Smaller bills/acts, more targeted in scope, responding to a clearly-articulated problem statement, seems more sensible to me.</p>
<p>"As to whether the CSR would result in a better outcome than NIS2, I'm afraid I do not know."</p>
<p>Given the scale of the cyber threat facing the UK's public sector, failing to account for this in the CSR bill could open the government up to intense scrutiny.</p>
<p>The National Audit Office's <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/01/29/nao_blasts_uk_gov_cyber/">report</a> into UK government security improvements in January 2025 laid bare the sorry state of its systems. Of the 72 most critical systems run by various departments, 58 were reviewed; auditors found a litany of security flaws across them and noted a staggeringly slow pace at which the issues were being addressed.</p>
<p>That is not an assessment which goes hand-in-hand with a public sector free from regular cyberattacks.</p>
<p>Each time a central authority, arm's-length body, local council, or NHS trust is compromised, the government's decision not to include the public sector within the scope of the CSR bill hands the opposition another opportunity to question its commitment to cybersecurity.</p>
<p>Labour does, at least, have some ammo to fire back if this scenario were to ever become reality, with the Conservatives having failed to enact the cybersecurity recommendations from its <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/05/30/uk_government_security_consultation/">2022 consultation</a>, despite having had more than two years to do so.</p>
<p>Even with the government's Cyber Action Plan, its reluctance to bring the public sector into the scope of its flagship cyber legislation fails to inspire any confidence that it has serious ambitions to improve security in this problem area. ®</p>

Photo from the town of Qaqortoq (then Julianehaab) between 1889 and 1910. Julianehaab (Qaqortoq) was founded in 1775 by the Norwegian farmer Anders Olesen and soon became an important center for trade. Today Qaqortoq is the central town in south Greenland.



  </p><div>
    
            <p><span>The first Nordic presence in Greenland dates back to Erik the Red, a Norse Viking banished from Iceland for manslaughter, who sought a new future in Greenland around the end of the 10</span><sup>th</sup><span> century. The name “Greenland” referred to the vegetation around Southern Greenland’s fjords, but the name was likely also given in an attempt to lure more Norse settlers to Erik’s settlement in Southeast Greenland. The Norse settlements in Greenland became part of a North Atlantic empire ruled from Norway.</span></p><p><span>The Norse stayed in Greenland for centuries. At the start of the 15</span><sup>th</sup><span> century, they disappeared with little trace. There are numerous possible reasons, including: a colder climate that made the island less habitable and conflict with the Inuit, who began to arrive in the areas that were populated by the Norse.</span></p><p>In 1721, Hans Egede, a Norwegian priest and missionary with support from the united Dano-Norwegian crown, reestablished contact with Greenland. A concern at the time was that the Norse settlers had missed the Reformation and were still Catholics. When Hans Egede arrived, however, he found only the Inuit, by then firmly established in most of Greenland, and he decided to focus his efforts on converting them to Christianity.</p><p>That marked the beginning of the colonial period. It was a slow start, and Norwegian-Danish influence in Greenland had to compete with other foreign powers, notably the Dutch. In a process that spanned generations, the Inuit were converted to Christianity, and Greenland was both politically and economically tied to Denmark-Norway in a colonial relationship.</p><p><span>When the monarchy of Denmark and Norway broke apart in 1814, Denmark kept Greenland. Danish-Greenlandic colonial relations in the 19</span><sup>th</sup><span> and early 20</span><sup>th</sup><span> centuries were characterized by a Danish paternalistic policy for cautious development, ensuring that Greenland would be a profitable colony. In 1916, Denmark’s rights to Greenland were confirmed by the United States, as part of a deal that facilitated the American purchase of the Danish West Indies. A controversy concerning a Norwegian claim to parts of Greenland ended in 1933, when the Permanent Court of International Justice, founded by the League of Nations, ruled against Norway.</span></p><p>After the Second World War, the United Nations pushed for decolonization in Greenland. In 1953, the former colony was incorporated into Denmark and granted two seats in the Danish Parliament. In 1979, Greenland achieved Home Rule, which included the formation of the Greenlandic Parliament, and it gained self-rule in 2009 through the passage of a law that included a ‘blueprint’ for seeking independence. The 2009 law firmly established that the decision to go for independence from Denmark would now rest with the Greenlandic people.</p><p><span>There is no doubt that the majority of Greenlanders want to use this option eventually. </span><a href="https://www.veriangroup.com/news-and-insights/opinion-poll-greenland-2025" rel=""><u>Polls</u></a><span> show this. Independence has been accepted in Denmark as well. However, polls also consistently show that Greenlanders do not want independence if the price is the collapse of the Greenlandic welfare state. Herein lies the challenge. Greenland is vast, stretching over more than 800,000 square miles, but its population is tiny, consisting of only 56,000 people. Furthermore, the climate remains harsh for most of the year, especially in the North. For these reasons, among others, the Greenlandic government remains dependent on a yearly block grant from Denmark of roughly $600 million, as well as on the Danish state supporting services in areas such as defense, coast guard, and law enforcement. Greenlandic independence, therefore, depends on substantial continued Danish assistance after independence, something the Greenlandic government has yet to convince Denmark to accept.</span></p><p><span>It is in this context that President Donald Trump saw an opening to acquire Greenland. American strategic interests in Greenland are not new, but stretch back into the 19</span><sup>th</sup><span> century. Extensive U.S. involvement in Greenland, however, did not materialize until the Second World War, triggered by the German invasion of Denmark on April 9, 1940. As such, the German occupation of Denmark put Greenland in a peculiar position and caused worry in the United States that Greenland’s geography could eventually be used against it. For that reason, Washington reacted favorably when the Danish ambassador to the U.S., Henrik Kauffmann, took the rather unusual step of proposing </span><em>himself</em><span> as the true representative of free Denmark, cutting bonds with the occupied country. Kauffmann offered the United States base rights in Greenland for the duration of the war.</span></p><p>This was the start of the U.S. presence in Greenland. After the Second World War, a liberated Denmark honored Kauffmann’s commitments, and from 1949, the United States and Denmark became allies through NATO. During the Cold War and the decades after, the U.S. safeguarded its security interests in Greenland: tracking Russian missiles, bomber planes, and nuclear-armed submarines from that location. This became the basis for the “Greenland card” in U.S.-Danish relations: the idea that base rights in Greenland constituted an important contribution from Denmark and Greenland to the U.S. and NATO.</p><p>This state of affairs changed with Donald Trump. In the broader context of U.S.-European relations in the age of “America First,” the U.S. had to push its ‘free-riding’ European allies to do more on every front. No longer would Washington be satisfied with having a free hand in Greenland. Instead, Denmark was now a bad ally for not taking responsibility for U.S. security concerning Greenland. In Trump’s narrative, this perceived Danish lapse justified an American takeover of Greenland in its entirety. Trump even went so far as to refuse to rule out the use of military force. Other reasons, voiced by Trump, included securing mineral wealth, especially rare earth minerals, as well as a more general ambition to make the U.S. greater through territorial expansion.</p><p><span>The Greenlandic right to self-determination should form the bedrock for any future developments. For that reason, as well as for many other reasons, the U.S. military conquest of Greenland is beyond unacceptable. The American public agrees: in a February 2025 </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/34173/us-views-on-the-us-taking-control-of-greenland/?srsltid=AfmBOopQzG4-1XhXtMIlwNLb9XLCdw6RgX5W67YpqRHrYFEhkLODPoF3" rel=""><u>poll</u></a><span>, only 11% expressed support for using military force to take control of Greenland, while 69% opposed it. This may be why the Trump administration has not mentioned the military ‘option’ recently. Instead, the Trump administration now seems focused on winning over the ‘hearts and minds’ of the Greenlanders. At the same time, </span><a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/08/27/europe/denmark-summons-us-envoy-greenland-intl" rel=""><u>stories</u></a><span> about US influence agents compiling lists of pro-American and anti-American individuals caused understandable worry in Nuuk and Copenhagen – a behavior that few countries would expect from their allies.</span></p><p><span>So far, the Trump administration has not been particularly successful. A </span><a href="https://www.veriangroup.com/news-and-insights/opinion-poll-greenland-2025" rel=""><u>poll</u></a><span> from January shows that only 6% of Greenlanders are in favor of joining the U.S., with 85% against it. Greenlandic politicians have rejected the idea on numerous occasions, and in March, the party leaders of all Greenlandic parties issued a joint rejection of American attempts to annex Greenland. Most telling, the Trump team had to give up on finding Greenlandic hosts willing to meet the Second Lady Usha Vance during her planned trip to Nuuk that month.</span></p><p>Where do we go from here? The United States should cease its ill-fated adventurism and work with Greenland and Denmark to secure its legitimate security interests. This would be nothing new, but a return to policies that served the United States well for the last 75 years.</p>
