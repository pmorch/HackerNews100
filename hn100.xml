            <guid>43558182</guid>
            <pubDate>Wed, 02 Apr 2025 16:03:12 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/digital-archive">https://spectrum.ieee.org/digital-archive</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43558182">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-headline="How Digital Archivists Are Saving Public Information from the Memory Hole"><p>In the three decades since <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/brewster-kahle-on-whats-next-for-the-decentralized-web-movement" target="_self">Brewster Kahle</a> spun up the nonprofit <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/internet">Internet</a> Archive’s <a href="https://web.archive.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Wayback Machine</a>, it has scaled up to include government websites and datasets—many of which are essential to the engineering and scientific communities. U.S. government agencies like the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/national-science-foundation">National Science Foundation</a>, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/department-of-energy">Department of Energy</a>, and <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/nasa">NASA</a> are critical sources of research data, technical specifications, and standards documentation in pretty much every area where <em><em><a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/">IEEE Spectrum</a></em></em>’s audience works—AI &amp; computer science, biomedical devices, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/power-and-energy">power and energy</a>, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/topic/semiconductors/">semiconductors</a>, telecommunications…the list goes on.</p><p>Access to that governmental data directly affects the reproducibility of experiments, the validation of models, and the integrity of the scholarly record. </p><p>So what happens if an entire dataset vanishes? Among other things, it can invalidate years of research built upon that foundation. </p><p>Until recently, wholesale deletion of data has been rare. In the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/united-states">United States</a>, presidential transitions typically involve some changes to government websites to reflect new policy priorities. And after 9/11, the George W. Bush administration removed “<a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/story?id=7496067&amp;page=1#:~:text=Unclassified%20military%20after%2Daction%20reports%2C%20an%20FAA%20database,amid%20fears%20that%20terrorists%20might%20find%20information" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">millions of bytes</a>” of information from government sites for security reasons as well as hundreds of <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/department-of-defense">Department of Defense</a> documents and “tens of thousands” of <a href="https://www.ferc.gov/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Federal Energy Regulation Commission</a> files. </p><p>The <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/obama">Obama</a> and Biden administrations likewise made changes to government websites but didn’t engage in large-scale removal of Web pages or datasets. Obama, in fact, expanded public access to government data in 2009 by launching <a href="http://data.gov/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Data.gov</a>, whose stated mission is in part “to unleash the power of government open data to inform decisions by the public and policymakers.”</p><p> During President Donald J. Trump’s first term, researchers at the Environmental Data &amp; Governance Initiative <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0246450" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">found</a> that some government sites became inaccessible, and the phrase “climate change” was purged from several government Web pages.</p><p>Access to governmental data directly affects the reproducibility of experiments, the validation of models, and the integrity of the scholarly record.</p><p>The second term has been different. In February, a few weeks after Trump was sworn in for his second term, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/02/upshot/trump-government-websites-missing-pages.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em><em>The New York Times</em></em> reported</a> that his administration took down more than 8,000 Web pages and <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/databases">databases</a>. Many of those pages have since reappeared, but some of the restored pages and files have had changes, including the erasure of <a href="https://grist.org/language/trump-delete-climate-change-words-resilience-order/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">terms like “climate change” (again) and “clean energy,”</a><em><em>Grist</em></em> reports. These moves have faced multiple court challenges; on 11 February, for instance, a federal judge ordered that public access to Web pages and datasets belonging to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration be restored. </p><p>In our April <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/internet-archive-saving-us-data" target="_blank">issue</a>, <em><em>Spectrum</em></em> Assistant Editor Gwendolyn Rak <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/internet-archive-saving-us-data" target="_self">reports</a> on efforts to preserve public access to information. In addition to the ongoing work at the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/internet-archive">Internet Archive</a>, she describes how archivists at the <a href="https://lil.law.harvard.edu/our-work/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Library Innovation Lab at Harvard Law School</a> amassed a copy of the 16-terabyte <a href="https://lil.law.harvard.edu/blog/2025/02/06/announcing-data-gov-archive/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">archive of Data.gov,</a> which includes more than 311,000 public datasets. That copied archive is being updated daily with new data hoovered up via automated queries to application <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/programming">programming</a> interfaces (APIs). </p><p>Archivists are the guardians of memory. We depend on them to help us stay in touch with our history, maintain our knowledge base, and provide context, allowing us to understand how we came to be where we are and to light the way forward. In the fields of science, engineering, and medicine, where today’s innovations stand on the shoulders of yesterday’s discoveries, these digital preservationists ensure that the circuit of human knowledge remains unbroken.</p><p><em>This article appears in the April 2025 print issue as “Lots of Copies Keep Stuff Safe.”</em></p><p><em>Editor’s note: This post was revised to match the print version.</em></p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>As seen previously, the Joy-Cons will be bigger than on the original Switch and will feature larger shoulder buttons on the inside edges. The system itself has a larger, "more sturdy" stand that can be adjusted to sit at multiple angles. A second USB-C outlet on the top of the system will allow for easier charging and connections.</p>
<p>Third-party publishers announced a number of ports for the Switch 2, including <em>Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition, Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</em>, <em>Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition, Hades II, Street Fighter VI, Split Fiction, EA Sports FC, Madden NFL, Hogwarts Legacy </em>(with new Mouse Controls)<em>, Yakuza 0 Director's Cut, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4, and Hitman: World of Assassination</em>.</p>

<p>FromSoftware also offered an extended preview of a new vampire-themed, <em>Bloodborne</em>-inspired action RPG game called <em>The Duskbloods</em>. The Switch 2 exclusive, planned for 2026, showed off a wide range of metaphyiscal imagery and both melee and gun-based combat, including a character that flies around in a metal suit with a jetpack.</p>

<p>Nintendo Switch Online memberships will carry over to Switch 2. And Switch 2 owners who subscribe to the Expansion Pack will get access to a library of Nintendo GameCube games, including <em>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</em>,&nbsp;<em>Soulcalibur II, and F-Zero GX </em>at launch, with more to be added in the future. These games will feature "sharper graphics and higher resolution" than the original releases, Nintendo said. A replica wireless GameCube controller will also be available for purchase by Nintendo Switch Online members.</p>
<p>Nintendo also showed a small preview of a new, open-world <i>Kirby Air Riders </i>game. The follow-up to GameCube's <em>Kirby's Air Ride</em> showed the pink puffball grabbing a jetpack-propelled star across verdant, grassy fields.</p>

<p>The presentation concluded with a new 3D <em>Donkey Kong</em> game called <em>Donkey Kong Bonanza</em>, planned for July 17<em>.</em> The trailer showed a redesigned, cuter version of the big ape climbing cliffs, digging through highly destructible ground, and bashing enemies into one another with massive punches, alongside classic 2D and mine cart sections.</p>
<p>Nintendo will send out invitations for "priority" purchasing of the Switch 2, direct from the company, starting on May 8. Those who have purchased a Switch Online membership as of April 2, have had it for a minimum of 12 months, have opted to share gameplay data, and have logged at least 50 hours get priority. There will be a 72-hour window in which to use priority purchasing invitations.</p>

    </div><p>One of the first verified predictions of general relativity is the gravitational deflection of starlight. The effect was <a href="https://briankoberlein.com/post/einstein-and-eddington/" target="_blank">first observed in 1919</a> during a total solar eclipse. Since stars appear as points of light, the effect is seen as an apparent shift in the position of stars near the eclipse. But the effect happens more generally.</p>


										    
																					<p>If a distant galaxy is obscured by a closer one, some of the distant light is gravitationally lensed around the closer galaxy, giving us a warped and distorted view of the faraway stars. This effect can also magnify the distant galaxy, making its light appear brighter, and we have used this effect to observe some of the most distant stars in the universe.</p>
<p>But perhaps the most beautiful effect of gravitational lensing is what's known as an Einstein Ring. This is where the <a href="https://phys.org/tags/distant+galaxy/" rel="tag">distant galaxy</a> is so perfectly centered behind the closer galaxy that its light is distorted into a circle of light. Einstein was aware of the effect but said in 1936 that "there is no hope of observing this phenomenon directly." But as brilliant as Einstein was, he couldn't imagine the power of modern telescopes.</p>
<p>We have now found dozens of Einstein rings, and one of the more beautiful examples was recently found by JWST, as seen in the image above. The close galaxy in the foreground is an <a href="https://phys.org/tags/elliptical+galaxy/" rel="tag">elliptical galaxy</a> that's part of a large cluster known as SMACS J0028.2-7537. The more colorful galaxy warped around it is a <a href="https://phys.org/tags/spiral+galaxy/" rel="tag">spiral galaxy</a> similar to the Milky Way. It is billions of years more distant, but perfectly aligned to create the almost perfect ring.</p>
<p>Of course, this image is only possible because of our vantage point. Astronomers in other galaxies wouldn't catch such a wondrous image. Yet another astronomical example of how beauty is not only in the eye of the beholder, but also where that beholder is.</p>

<div>
    <p><span><strong>People hoping to build muscle with the support of a creatine supplement might be disappointed by new research which shows it has little to no effect when taken at the recommended level.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p>People who take the popular sports supplement creatine and lift weights do not build muscle any faster than those who do resistance training without the supplement, new research shows. &nbsp;</p>
<p>A UNSW-led clinical trial that put 54 people through a 12-week resistance training program found no difference between those who took the supplement at the recommended dose and those who did not, the research published in <i><a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/17/6/1081" target="_blank" data-click_category="TextComponentRichText" data-click_id="text_Nutrients" data-click_title="RichText" data-click_name="Nutrients">Nutrients</a></i> shows.</p>
<p>Both groups in the randomised control trial put on an average of two kilograms of lean body mass during the program, which involved three supervised resistance training sessions per week.</p>
<p>“We’ve shown that taking five grams of creatine supplement per day does not make any difference to the amount of lean muscle mass people put on while resistance training,” said senior author <a href="https://www.unsw.edu.au/staff/mandy-hagstrom" target="_self" data-click_category="TextComponentRichText" data-click_id="text_Dr Mandy Hagstrom" data-click_title="RichText" data-click_name="Dr Mandy Hagstrom">Dr Mandy Hagstrom</a>, from UNSW’s <a href="https://www.unsw.edu.au/medicine-health/our-schools/health-sciences" target="_self" data-click_category="TextComponentRichText" data-click_id="text_School of Health Sciences" data-click_title="RichText" data-click_name="School of Health Sciences">School of Health Sciences</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The benefits of creatine may have been overestimated in the past, due to methodological problems with previous studies,” she added.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Creatine is a naturally occurring compound which supplies energy to muscles. It is produced by the liver, pancreas and kidneys, and found in protein-rich foods. Previous research shows creatine supplements help build muscles, enhance athletic performance, and may even have cognitive benefits.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, previous trials have started supplementation and exercise programs on the same day, making it difficult to separate the effect of each on muscle gains, Dr Hagstrom said. They’ve also overlooked the potential for creatine to cause water retention, though more research was needed to confirm this.</p>
<p>So, in this trial, those in the supplement group started on creatine one week before the exercise program began, taking five grams per day, which is at the upper end of the recommended maintenance dose of three to five grams.</p>
<p>“We had what we call a wash-in phase, where half of the participants started taking the supplement, without changing anything else in their daily life, to give their body a chance to stabilise in terms of its response to the supplement,” Dr Hagstrom said.&nbsp;</p>

    <h2>The effect of creatine with and without resistance training</h2>
<p>During that first week people taking creatine gained more lean body mass, particularly women, gaining an average of 0.5 kilograms more than the control group. However, the extra gains they made varied greatly, and soon dropped back to match those of the control group.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The people taking the creatine supplement saw changes before they even started exercising, which leads us to believe that it wasn’t actual real muscle growth, but potentially fluid retention,” Dr Hagstrom said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Then once they started exercising, they saw no additional benefit from creatine which suggests that five grams per day is not enough if you’re taking it for the purposes of building muscle.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>By comparison, previous trials with no wash-in period found those on creatine gained one kilogram more muscle, than those not taking the supplement, during trials spanning four to 12 weeks.</p>
<p>“In theory then you would have expected our creatine group to put on three kilograms of muscle over the 12-week program, but they didn’t,” said first author <a href="https://www.unsw.edu.au/staff/imtiaz-desai">Dr Imtiaz Desai</a>, from UNSW’s School of Health Sciences and <a href="https://neura.edu.au/" target="_blank" data-click_category="TextComponentRichText" data-click_id="text_Neuroscience Research Australia (NeuRA)" data-click_title="RichText" data-click_name="Neuroscience Research Australia (NeuRA)">Neuroscience Research Australia (NeuRA)</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<div>
    <p>The participants, aged 18 to 50, were all relatively healthy people doing less than the recommended minimum of 150 minutes of moderate intensity exercise per week.</p>
<div><p>They were put through the same training program and had their measurements taken at multiple stages using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, a non-invasive imaging technique that measures bone mineral density (BMD) and body composition. They were also required to keep a food log three days prior to each assessment, which showed no significant differences in their diets.&nbsp;</p><p>
&nbsp;
Those on creatine did bypass a loading phase, which includes taking 20 to 25 grams daily for up to one week. While it is common to start with a loading phase, it can cause gastrointestinal issues and is not necessary to reach saturation levels – the maximum that the body can store at any one time.&nbsp;</p></div>

    <h2><strong>More research needed on creatine doses</strong></h2>
<p>The trial suggests people need to take more creatine than is commonly thought to get the desired benefit of additional muscle gains, the experts say.</p>
<div><p>Just how much more will need to be the subject of further research, but 10 grams could be the dose to test first, given it's already shown to be safe and promising for both brain and bone health, Dr Hagstrom said.&nbsp;</p><p>
&nbsp;
A longer study would also be beneficial, added Dr Desai, as would measuring body water content, tracking the menstrual cycle – which can affect fluid retention – and creatine absorption, which was not feasible for this trial.&nbsp;</p></div>
<div><p>“It would be really interesting to see if creatine has more of a long-term benefit,” said Dr Desai. “When you start weight training, you have those beginner gains in strength and those start tapering off around the 12-week mark and become slower, so it’s possible the support from creatine might come at a later stage.”&nbsp;</p><p>
&nbsp;
In the meantime, the researchers hope it will give people more realistic expectations on creatine use, and prompt them to question claims made in the marketing of some supplements. &nbsp;</p><p>
&nbsp;
“For your average person taking creatine to boost their gains in the gym, this will hopefully change their perception about what it can help them achieve,” Dr Desai said. “For professional athletes, particularly those who must be at a particular weight for their sport, the findings may inform how and when they take the supplement.”&nbsp;</p><p>
&nbsp;
As for researchers, it’s hoped the study may encourage others to start to use a wash-in phase, to better understand the impact of supplements with and without exercise.&nbsp;</p></div>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <p>It’s&nbsp;interesting to me that <em>Revenge of the Nerds</em>, while still full up of the nostalgia that the 80s lends us, is lately being <a href="http://the-toast.net/2014/09/30/sexual-racial-politics-nerd-culture-dialogue/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">repositioned in the zeitgeist</a>. What was viewed for many years as a bit of harmless fun that waved the banner for nerds everywhere is finally being called out for exactly what it is; an Us vs Them revenge fest that never lets go of racism or misogyny, and damages the image of geek culture more than it applauds for it. That shouldn’t be surprising—<em>RotN</em> was always just a frat house comedy with a thin nerdy gloss applied to it. And that’s fine with me, because that was never my go-to movie for feeling the geeky solidarity.</p>
<p>No, my friends. That movie was <em>Real Genius</em>.</p>

<p><em>Real Genius</em> was loosely (very very <em>very</em> loosely) inspired by actual events that took place when university students were working to&nbsp;crack laser technology. But in <em>Real Genius</em>, this is being done on the fictional Pacific Tech campus, where the students are unknowingly creating that laser for the CIA to use in government sanctioned hits from space. They don’t know this because their odious professor, Dr. Hathaway (played to a tee by William Atherton), obviously isn’t letting them in on the secret. He’s too busy skimming off the funds that the government is providing to the project, so he can renovate his house.</p>
<p><a href="https://reactormag.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/real-genius3.jpg"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://reactormag.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/real-genius3.jpg" alt="Real Genius, Mitch Taylor" width="740" height="314"></a></p>
<p>Our protagonist is fifteen-year-old Mitch Taylor (Gabriel Jarrett), who is accepted early to Pacific Tech because, well, he’s a genius. He’s assigned to the laser project, working with his new roommate Chris Knight (Val Kilmer), a senior at the school who appears to have given up on taking college all that seriously. So… burnt out upper classman plus eager-to-please, impressionable freshman? We’re already set up for some prime Odd Couple shenanigans. We’re introduced to a guy named Kent and his cronies, who are also working on the laser project. Unlike Chris, Kent is the ultimate sycophant and only too happy to throw other students under the bus provided he gets to be top dog. So now we have a rivalry. Mitch meets a lot of strange people at Pacific Tech, one of them being Jordan, one of the campus’ few women who happens to size Mitch up and make him a sweater the day after meeting him, which she excitedly presents to him in men’s room while he’s peeing. So now we have a love story.</p>
<p>And… that’s pretty much where the comparisons to most college flicks and <em>Real Genius</em> ends. Because the film is about a lot more than that, for all it is a very 80s campus comedy. For one, the movie is better at portraying geeks in ways that don’t just melt down to old tropes of pocket protectors and bow ties and awkwardness. It communicates that having an outrageous IQ can be isolating, but doesn’t make all smart people out to be socially undeveloped shut-ins. It also shows us how being driven toward answers can blind even the most optimistic, well-meaning folks into making terrible mistakes. And it communicates what it’s like to study for finals more realistically than any film I’ve ever seen, which is an accomplishment and a half.</p>
<p><a href="https://reactormag.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/real-genius4.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="https://reactormag.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/real-genius4.jpg" alt="Real Genius, Chris Knight, Val Kilmer" width="740" height="355"></a></p>
<p>No really, there’s a scene where everyone is gathered around a communal table to cram for the exam, and one guy just gets up and starts <em>screaming</em> at everyone before running from the building. Everyone else is unresponsive and some other dude sitting on the room’s perimeter moves into his vacated seat without comment. That’s basically the experience distilled into its purest form.</p>
<p>Also, did I mention that it ends on a Tears For Fears song? Because that should be enough to recommend it right there.</p>
<p><a href="https://reactormag.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/real-genius9.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="https://reactormag.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/real-genius9.jpg" alt="Real Genius, 1985" width="740" height="416"></a></p>
<p>Another great thing about this film is how it <em>doesn’t</em> couch itself in the “nerd versus jock” dynamic. It’s a boring cliche that rarely bothers to examine the realities of persecution due to differences. Instead, it herds people into group stereotypes and activity negates character complexity. <em>Real Genius</em> knows this, and most of the rivalry here is geek-on-geek. We watch the very real dynamic of people in the same social circle trying to one-up each other to gain status, stroke their own egos, or flat out cause trouble for fun. When we reach the “party with hot girls” part of the film that so many college movies unthinkingly provide, the narrative beelines away from any form of non-consensual action; the party is full of student beauticians who are keen to meet some boys, and when the guys from Pacific Tech balk at having to talk to them, Chris Knight points out that they might try using their brains to impress them. The most uncomfortable person at the party is not any of the female attendants, but Mitch… understandable because he’s fifteen and this is probably the highest concentration of bikinis he’s ever witnessed. He finally starts having fun when he realizes that Jordan is there, testing scuba equipment in the pool.</p>
<p>The virtually opposing approaches to life that Mitch and Chris represent is the focal point of the tale, the paragon of straight-laced nerd-dom juxtaposed with the free-wheeling, frenetic creativity that Knight gears his mind toward. Mitch is distraught by the fact that a student he’d previously idolized appears to be nothing more than another party-hard slacker who doesn’t seem to care one bit about their work they’re doing. It’s not until later that he finds out this attitude is new; Chris was once just like Mitch, but he relaxed into this new mindset when he followed a man into their dorm room closet. (I swear that’s not a metaphor.) That man—Lazlo Hollyfeld—was a big shot student at Pacific Tech in the decade previous, who went a little out of his mind when he found out that his inventions were being used to harm others. Seeing this, Chris realized that spending his life focused on work for work’s sake was a mistake.</p>
<p><a href="https://reactormag.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/real-genius6.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://reactormag.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/real-genius6.jpg" alt="Real Genius, Dr. Hathaway, William Atherton" width="740" height="359"></a></p>
<p>Unfortunately, Knight’s new groove is making it harder for Dr. Hathaway to meet his laser deadline, so the professor decides to spitefully ruin Chris’ life—giving Kent the post-school job he was already promised and flunking him out of the Pacific Tech program, preventing him from graduating. With a little pep talk from Mitch, Chris throws himself back into their project and makes real headway on the laser just to prove Hathaway wrong. It’s only after they deliver it to Hathaway that Lazlo leaves the steam tunnels below their closet and points out that what they created was likely intended for a very specific purpose—to kill people. From space. From that point on, the crew is on the clock to ruin the laser’s presentation for the military and CIA and to get even with Dr. Hathaway for using them. (Also to prank Kent because he kind of deserves it for being a lapdog and generally horrible to Mitch just because the kid is younger and smarter than he is.)</p>
<p>The film makes it a mission to prove that what geeks and geniuses are best at isn’t memorizing math formulas and elements off the periodic table; it’s their ability to be creative and in doing so, change the world around us. The students do get even with Dr. Hathaway, but they do it in an inspired way that essentially harms no one except him—they redirect the laser so it goes off at his home, where they’ve situated a giant ball of unpopped popcorn. <em>Ka-blooey.</em> Essentially, they destroy the thing that Hathaway was siphoning money off of the laser program to gain, his fancy house. It makes the project seem like a bust, effectively ruins Hathaway, and punishes him for being dishonest. As revenge schemes go, it’s a remarkably fair-minded one that’s fun to boot. And it’s not about proving their superiority over another group, but instead about taking back control over what they’ve created.</p>
<p><a href="https://reactormag.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/real-genius5.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://reactormag.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/real-genius5.jpg" alt="Real Genius, popcorn house" width="740" height="356"></a></p>
<p>The film doesn’t showcase as many women as we might hope for (and the Pacific Tech campus is also blindingly white overall, though Chris’ friend Ikagami is present and happily avoids most of your average Asian stereotypes aside from smartness), but the way it treats the majority of those women is impressive, particularly for this era in filmmaking… no doubt largely due to the movie’s female director, Martha Coolidge. There are few instances of pure objectification just for the sake of it in <em>Real Genius</em>; even though the co-ed party shows plenty of girls in swimsuits, the shots that reveal them are often at a distance, never lingering. While Knight is blunt in his sexual overtures to women, the ones he encounters are more than capable of tackling his advances and throwing them back in his face when he’s not up to snuff. His directness gives him no power, which is extremely important because it indicates that not every woman is automatically going to swoon over that kind of come-on. (Which, in turn, suggests that women are real, unique individuals with different preferences.) And when they aren’t interested, Chris is never entitled or angry about it—he simply moves on.</p>
<p>I really can’t talk about women in this film without focusing up on Jordan Cochran. While she does occupy a typically female place in the plot (Mitch’s love interest), her portrayal by Michelle Meyrink is nothing short of revelatory when it comes to broadening the variety of women that we should expect in fiction. To start, Jordan is not a conventionally attractive girl, certainly not in a California/feature film sense. She has a weird haircut and a child-like cadence to her voice, and she’s not particularly fashionable. It’s also entirely possible for this character to read somewhere on the autistic spectrum, though by way of a Hollywoodified lens; she is uncertain of common boundaries (visiting Mitch in the bathroom and being perturbed by his inability to pee in front of her), she has severe insomnia (it’s suggested that she drove her roommate to a nervous breakdown by never ever sleeping), she misunderstands the social cues of others (she frequently assumes the ends of Mitch’s sentences incorrectly), and her idea of what constitutes an everyday activity would hardly pass for your average citizen (Mitch finds her sanding her dorm room floor late one night and she uses the beautician party as an excuse to test a rebreather she designed herself). It’s not the fact that she might be on the spectrum itself that’s remarkable, but the fact that the film never suggests that Jordan should be viewed differently because of it. It doesn’t make her “special” in a manic pixie dream way, but it doesn’t make her pitiable either. She’s simply who she is, and that person is still portrayed as desirable and engaging and brilliant.</p>
<p><a href="https://reactormag.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/real-genius8.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://reactormag.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/real-genius8.jpg" alt="Real Genius, Jordan Cochran" width="740" height="357"></a></p>
<p>It helps that she’s very much her own kind of genius. Jordan makes most of her own equipment, clearly comfortable with a variety of tools and practical materials. She isn’t involved in the laser project whatsoever—in fact, we’re never told what Jordan is at Pacific Tech to do aside from being some sort of eclectic savant who cares about sled velocity on ice and the smoothness of her floors. She comes off as a kind of mad scientist, probably the sort of person to invent a few hundred incredibly useful patents throughout the course of her life and hopefully retire rich with a giant lab/workshop in her basement where she can create gorgeous metalwork in peace. Prior to <em>Real Genius</em>, Meyrink appeared in <em>Revenge of the Nerds</em> as one of the members of Omega Mu, the nerd girl sorority. In that movie, she and her Greek sisters were figures to be laughed at. Here, she is an odd force to be reckoned with. There is simply no comparison; one of these characters is inspirational to young women, and the other is decidedly not. In the end, Jordan’s status as Mitch’s girlfriend has very little to do with her place in the story (outside of letting her meet these characters and form friendships with them), an effective 180 from her position as&nbsp;Gilbert’s&nbsp;love interest&nbsp;in <em>Revenge of the Nerds</em>. Jordan is a heroic character in <em>Real Genius</em>, whereas Judy is largely a trophy for the (male) hero in <em>RotN</em>.</p>
<p>What’s also impressive about <em>Real Genius</em> is that it allows its focal character, Mitch Taylor, to be as young as he is, with all the embarrassment and strangeness that being fifteen entails. Mitch calls his parents crying because college isn’t working out the way he’d prefer, and he begs to come home. Mitch is cornered alone by an older, more experienced woman who clearly wants to teach him “the ways of the world,” but he runs from the scenario, owning up to his discomfort and knowing that he’d rather be with Jordan.<span>&nbsp; </span>The film never makes fun of Mitch for being less advanced than his peers or a perceived “square,” never sniggers at him for being the straight-laced one who cares about his work. It’s never suggested that he should simply play along, act older, learn to enjoy things that don’t interest him. Chris Knight has to convince him to loosen up by presenting real, hard data on why sticking too hard to the work might hurt him in the long run. And even then, Mitch doesn’t become a mini version of his mentor—he simply takes Knight’s advice to heart and figures out what his own version of relaxed is.</p>
<p><a href="https://reactormag.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/real-genius2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://reactormag.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/real-genius2.jpg" alt="Real Genius, Mitch Taylor, Chris Knight" width="740" height="317"></a></p>
<p>Rather than placing geeks on someone else’s playground, forcing them into an opposing socially-constructed box and proving that they can “play the game” better than everyone else by virtue of being smarter, <em>Real Genius</em> shows that nerds have their own games. They don’t need to run faster or get more pledges or give themselves makeovers to have fun and prove their worth. Mitch wakes up to a hall full of ice one morning; Ikagami has somehow created a gas that turns into the slippery stuff, and then back into a gas after a few hours. Chris hails the accomplishment as “Pacific Tech’s: Smart People on Ice!” The walls of the dorms are covered in strange graffiti, people shuffle back and forth between common areas and rooms in their weird-looking pajamas and towels. Knight has appointed himself as the dorm resident in charge of fun, trying to get people away from their books with “Mutant Hamster Races” and “Madame Curie Lookalike Contests.” In short, it’s like any other college campus, complete with overworked students. Nerds are not a rare and exotic breed of people, but they do make some awesome stuff, and that’s why they make for good movie plots.</p>
<p>It also helps that <em>Real Genius</em> might be one of the most quotable films on the planet. Even Joss Whedon would cry at how snappy the dialogue is, which is recommendation enough over most college movies where dialogue can be horrifically contrived. Chris Knight is the primary conduit of said snappiness, and you have to wonder how many of Kilmer’s lines are ad-libbed, because it seems like it might be a lot of them. It’s encouraging to have a character who at the start appears to be such a parody of himself—the super-smart-guy-who-can-also-be-a-jerk-because-he’s-good-looking-and-snarky—turn out to be a genuinely decent person who cares about people. And he proves that by changing his tactics with others; when he realizes that Mitch is not responding to devil-may-care antics, he quits the act and explains his reasons for exhibiting rather extreme senioritis. It comes clear very quickly that his primary reason for asking Dr. Hathaway to make Mitch his roommate is to make certain that Mitch doesn’t make his (or Lazlo’s) mistakes. Without realizing that they’re already being lured into the same gambit that snagged Lazlo years ago, Chris is already trying to provide Mitch with the tools he needs to avoid the scenario. He may be a cynic, as he says, but he’s inciting campus rowdiness to protect everyone’s health and expand their horizons, not to encourage them to blow their educations.</p>

<p>In that way, <em>Real Genius</em> occupies an interesting middle ground in how it portrays education for a film that’s all about brainy, bookish people. It’s not suggesting that going to college should be one long non-stop alcohol-fueled party haze, but it’s also not suggesting that what you learn at a higher education facility is the only valuable knowledge you will ever absorb. Life experience is shown to be equally (or even more) valuable. And while it can be easier to retreat into books when you’re a certain kind of person, the tale&nbsp;cautions that it’s important to&nbsp;stay aware of the world around you–otherwise you might miss when you’re being taken advantage of. For a film that’s already 30 years old, the wisdom it displays is universal; value your emotional development as much as your intellectual development; use your abilities to improve the world; question authority; definitely don’t make dangerous weapons for your college professors.</p>
<p>So you can keep <em>Revenge of the Nerds</em>, if that’s your thing, and all the other films of its ilk. They do a fairly poor job of committing the experience of social outsiders to memory. For a film that offers a chance to laugh with people rather than at them, to appreciate what college truly&nbsp;teaches most of us, to embrace what’s really fun about being an unabashed geek, I’d recommend <em>Real Genius</em> every single time.</p>

These acute impacts are more common for people with existing respiratory conditions such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This direct exposure does cost lives, but the total number is relatively small compared to the millions that die from chronic exposure to air pollution.</span></li><li><strong><span>Formation of particulate matter: </span></strong><span>Many of the pollutants we’ll look at contribute to health impacts </span><em><span>indirectly</span></em><span> by breaking down to form secondary smaller particles. These particles are called “particulate matter”. Typically, the smaller the particles are, the worse they can be for human health because they can enter our lungs and airways — and, in some cases, the bloodstream. Particulate matter can cause respiratory and cardiovascular problems, including cancer, strokes, and heart attacks.</span></li><li><strong><span>Formation of ozone: </span></strong><span>Another </span><em><span>indirect</span></em><span> way these pollutants can affect our health is by forming a gas called ozone (O</span><sub><span>3</span></sub><span>). Ozone can cause breathing problems and worsen acute conditions like asthma and COPD</span><a href="#note-4"><sup><span>4</span></sup></a><span>. However, it also affects our health through chronic exposure by causing inflammation of the lungs, increasing the risk of respiratory diseases, and reducing our cardiovascular health.</span></li></ul><p><span>As we discuss each pollutant, we’ll briefly explain how it affects health through one or several pathways. While it’s difficult to pinpoint exactly how many deaths each pollutant causes, wherever possible, we’ll also try to give a rough order of magnitude estimate.</span></p><p><span>To give some sense of scale, </span><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/global-health?tab=chart&amp;Health+Area=Risk+factors&amp;Indicator=Air+pollution&amp;Metric=Number+of+deaths&amp;Source=IHME&amp;country=OWID_WRL~CHN~ZAF~BRA~USA~GBR~IND~RWA"><span>here</span></a><span> is the Global Burden of Disease’s breakdown of global deaths from air pollution.</span><a href="#note-5"><sup><span>5</span></sup></a></p><p><span>In 2021, this totaled around</span><strong><span> 8 million deaths.</span></strong><span> Note that there are also natural sources of particulate matter, so not </span><em><span>all</span></em><span> of these pollution deaths resulted from human emissions. But most did. For more on this, see our colleague Max Roser’s </span><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/data-review-air-pollution-deaths" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>article</span></a><span>, which looks at estimates from various sources.</span></p><p><strong><span>3.1 million</span></strong><span> came from </span><em><span>household</span></em><span> air pollution, a combination of direct toxicity and particulate matter. </span><strong><span>4.7 million</span></strong><span> came from outdoor particulate matter, and another </span><strong><span>half a million</span></strong><span> from outdoor ozone pollution.</span><a href="#note-6"><sup><span>6</span></sup></a></p><div><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/deaths-from-household-and-outdoor-air-pollution"><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/deaths-from-household-and-outdoor-air-pollution" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><picture><source id="grapher-preview-source" srcset="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/deaths-from-household-and-outdoor-air-pollution.png?imWidth=850 850w, https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/deaths-from-household-and-outdoor-air-pollution.png?imWidth=1700 1700w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px"><img src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/deaths-from-household-and-outdoor-air-pollution.png" width="850" height="600" loading="lazy" data-no-lightbox="true"></picture></a></figure></div><h2 id="breaking-down-the-sources-of-different-air-pollutants"><span>Breaking down the sources of different air pollutants</span><a href="#breaking-down-the-sources-of-different-air-pollutants"></a></h2><h2 id="sulfur-dioxide-the-source-of-acid-rain"><span>Sulfur dioxide: the source of acid rain</span><a href="#sulfur-dioxide-the-source-of-acid-rain"></a></h2><p><span>Sulfur dioxide (SO</span><sub><span>2</span></sub><span>) is the main pollutant that causes </span><a href="https://worksinprogress.co/issue/the-end-of-acid-rain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>acid rain</span></a><span>. This has been a major environmental problem because acid rain can change the chemistry of rivers and lakes, affecting fish populations, soils, and the extent and quality of forests. You can also see the effects of acid rain on older limestone and marble buildings and statues, where the acidity dissolves parts of the structure.</span></p><p><span>There are two ways that SO</span><sub><span>2</span></sub><span> </span><a href="https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/topics/in-depth/air-pollution/eow-it-affects-our-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>can threaten</span></a><span> human health. First, direct inhalation of SO</span><sub><span>2</span></sub><span> can exacerbate respiratory problems such as asthma and bronchitis. But its main contribution is by breaking down to form small particulate matter. While an exact figure is hard to pin down, given that sulfur dioxide is a substantial contributor to particulate matter and that at least 4 million deaths are linked to these small particles yearly, we would estimate that </span><strong><span>hundreds of thousands</span></strong><span> of deaths per year are linked to SO</span><sub><span>2</span></sub><span>.</span></p><p><span>SO</span><sub><span>2</span></sub><span> is formed when we burn fuels that contain sulfur.</span></p><p><span>The charts below show where global emissions come from and how these sectors have changed over time. In 2022, energy production was the biggest contributor by far. This is predominantly due to power from coal, which has sulfur impurities that are released when it’s burned.</span></p><p><span>The main contribution of the industry is the metal smelting process.</span><a href="#note-7"><sup><span>7</span></sup></a><span> This is because many of the ores that are used to produce metals – such as pyrite – contain large amounts of sulfur, which is released when they are roasted at high temperatures.</span></p><p><span>Oil also contains sulfur, which is why road transport, shipping, and aviation all contribute. Shipping emissions have received a lot of attention in the last few years because they </span><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/air-pollution?country=~OWID_WRL&amp;Pollutant=Sulfur+dioxide&amp;Sector=International+shipping&amp;Per+capita=false"><span>dropped by more than 70%</span></a><span> in 2020 after the introduction of tight regulations on maritime fuels.</span></p><p><span>You’ll notice that global emissions of SO</span><sub><span>2</span></sub><span> peaked in 1979 and have almost halved since then, thanks to the introduction of pollution controls, particularly in Europe, North America, and China. SO</span><sub><span>2 </span></sub><span>can be removed from smokestacks in coal plants using technologies that filter or “scrub” the sulfur away before it’s emitted into the atmosphere. This, combined with a </span><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/energy?tab=chart&amp;country=USA~GBR~OWID_EU27&amp;Total+or+Breakdown=Select+a+source&amp;Energy+or+Electricity=Electricity+only&amp;Metric=Share+of+total&amp;Select+a+source=Coal"><span>move away from coal</span></a><span> in Europe and North America, has led to a rapid reduction in emissions.</span><sub><span> </span></sub></p><h2 id="nitrogen-oxides-n-ox-the-reason-car-exhaust-fumes-are-so-damaging"><span>Nitrogen oxides (NOₓ): the reason car exhaust fumes are so damaging</span><a href="#nitrogen-oxides-n-ox-the-reason-car-exhaust-fumes-are-so-damaging"></a></h2><p><span>Nitrogen oxides (NOₓ) are a group of gases, mostly made up of nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO</span><sub><span>2</span></sub><span>). They are formed when fuels containing nitrogen (again, mostly fossil fuels) are burned, causing them to react with oxygen.</span></p><p><span>Like sulfur dioxide, which we just looked at, NOₓ can cause acid rain, threatening wildlife and ecosystems. NOₓ has a particularly large impact on human health because it acts through all three mechanisms we looked at earlier. It can be acutely toxic, inflaming the lungs. It reacts with other gases to form particulate matter, and it also forms ozone. NOₓ, therefore, causes smog and the thick haze you often see in highly polluted cities.</span></p><p><span>Again, we don’t have exact estimates for how many deaths it contributes to. But, given that it’s a main source of ozone (which kills around half a million) and a substantial fraction of particulate matter (which kills several million), it’s reasonable to expect that NOₓ is linked to </span><strong><span>over a million deaths yearly</span></strong><span>.</span></p><p><span>Since coal, oil, and gas all contain nitrogen, NOₓ is produced in various sectors, as the chart below shows. The biggest source is transport — mostly from road vehicles — where NOₓ is emitted from the exhaust of cars and trucks. This is almost matched by the burning of coal and gas for electricity production, shown as “energy” in the chart. Like road transport, burning fuel for shipping emits significant amounts of NOₓ, making it a leading source, too.</span></p><p><span>And industrial processes such as metal smelting, cement production, and petroleum refining contribute a lot.</span></p><p><span>A smaller but still important source is agriculture. When nitrogen is applied to crops as synthetic fertilizer or manure, some of this nitrogen is converted to nitrogen oxides (and ammonia, which we’ll come on to later) in the soil.</span><a href="#note-8"><sup><span>8</span></sup></a><span> While emissions of NOₓ from processes such as transport and electricity production have declined a lot globally, progress on agriculture has been much slower: emissions have flatlined but have not fallen much.</span></p><p><span>Some countries have been successful in drastically reducing emissions of NOₓ – with huge benefits for human health. Moving away from fossil fuels – particularly coal in electricity production – has led to a large decline in “energy” emissions (have a look at </span><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/air-pollution?time=1950..2022&amp;Pollutant=Nitrogen+oxides&amp;Sector=All+sectors+%28total%29&amp;Per+capita=false&amp;country=~GBR"><span>the United Kingdom</span></a><span> as an example). Setting pollution control standards for automakers has also played a crucial role in reducing emissions from road transport. NOₓ emissions from exhausts can be dramatically reduced through the use of </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalytic_converter" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>catalytic converters</span></a><span>, which are devices that split the NOₓ compounds into nitrogen and oxygen before they are released into the atmosphere.</span></p><h2 id="black-carbon-the-soot-that-fills-our-skies-and-lungs"><span>Black carbon: the soot that fills our skies and lungs</span><a href="#black-carbon-the-soot-that-fills-our-skies-and-lungs"></a></h2><p><span>Black carbon (BC) are the small particles that many of us know as “soot”.</span></p><p><span>As most of us know from experience — such as lighting a bonfire — soot is formed when we burn materials such as wood and biomass or fossil fuels like coal. It’s the </span><em><span>incomplete</span></em><span> combustion of these materials that leads to the formation of these BC particles.</span></p><p><span>These particles are black because they absorb light, and this absorption of sunlight contributes to climate change. However, when it comes to health, it contributes through its direct toxicity and the formation of small particulates.</span></p><p><span>Black carbon can be a major issue for household and outdoor particulate matter and </span><a href="https://drawdown.org/publications/reducing-black-carbon" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>probably contributes to</span></a><span> </span><strong><span>several million deaths per year</span></strong><span>.</span></p><p><span>In the charts below, you can see the sources of black carbon globally.</span></p><p><span>Unsurprisingly, the biggest contributor to BC is energy production, mostly coal and biomass burning for electricity and heat. Black carbon is a big problem in industrialized countries with large-scale electricity production, but also in lower-income countries where people rely on burning biomass and charcoal for cooking and heating.</span></p><p><span>Road transport is another major contributor since black carbon is also formed from diesel engines and exhausts. The open burning of waste also plays a surprisingly large role, particularly in low-to-middle-income countries, where this is often used for waste disposal.</span></p><p><span>Some countries — particularly richer ones — have seen </span><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/air-pollution?time=1950..2022&amp;Pollutant=Black+carbon&amp;Sector=All+sectors+%28total%29&amp;Per+capita=false&amp;country=GBR~FRA~DEU~USA"><span>a huge drop</span></a><span> in black carbon emissions over the last 50 years due to moving away from biomass and coal burning and introducing cleaner cars.</span></p><h2 id="methane-burping-cows-rice-paddies-and-gas-leaks"><span>Methane: burping cows, rice paddies, and gas leaks</span><a href="#methane-burping-cows-rice-paddies-and-gas-leaks"></a></h2><p><span>Methane (CH</span><sub><span>4</span></sub><span>) is a greenhouse gas, so it’s </span><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-greenhouse-gas-emissions" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>mostly discussed</span></a><span> regarding contributions to climate change.

Finding innovative ways to reduce the amount of methane produced per cow by changing their diets could also help.</span></p><p><span>Energy generation is another large source of methane. Most of it comes from leaks — which we call “fugitive emissions” — from oil and gas wells. If these are not properly managed, some methane escapes into the atmosphere. Another key source is coal mining. Monitoring oil and gas wells for methane leaks and enforcing regulations to ensure that limits are not breached can reduce these emissions. New drone and satellite technologies are </span><a href="https://www.catf.us/2023/02/guide-monitoring-quantifying-methane-emissions-oil-gas-sector/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>already being developed</span></a><span> to provide a global map of where these leaks are coming from.</span></p><p><span>The third sector that contributes a lot is waste. Methane is produced when organic material — like food waste or paper — rots in conditions without much oxygen (like in a landfill). Securely sealing landfills or capturing this methane for energy can effectively reduce these emissions. Methane from waste has been falling in many richer countries — like </span><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/air-pollution?time=1990..2022&amp;country=~GBR&amp;Pollutant=Methane&amp;Sector=Waste&amp;Per+capita=false"><span>the United Kingdom</span></a><span> — that have implemented these strategies.</span></p><h2 id="ammonia-nh3-it-s-all-about-farming"><span>Ammonia (NH</span><sub><span>3</span></sub><span>): it’s all about farming</span><a href="#ammonia-nh3-it-s-all-about-farming"></a></h2><p><span>As the chart below shows, nearly all human emissions of ammonia (NH</span><sub><span>3</span></sub><span>) come from agriculture.

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>At JangaFX, we make several products that run natively on Linux. We love the flexibility and power that Linux offers our developers, but shipping software on it is a whole different challenge.</p>
<p>Linux is an incredibly powerful platform, but when it comes to shipping software, it can feel like a minefield. Unlike other operating systems, Linux isn’t just one system—it’s a chaotic mix of different services, libraries, and even philosophies. Every distribution does things a little differently, and that means the same executable that works flawlessly on one system might completely break on another.</p>
<p>This shouldn’t even be a problem. The Linux kernel itself has maintained relatively stable system calls. But everything built on top of it changes constantly in ways that break compatibility, making it incredibly frustrating to ship software that "just works." If you’re developing for Linux, you’re not targeting a single platform—you’re navigating an ecosystem that has evolved without much concern for binary compatibility.</p>
<p>Some of us, coming from the game industry before moving into VFX have dealt with this problem before. Shipping games on Linux has always been a nightmare, and the same issues persists regardless of industry. In this article, We're going to explain why we think containers are <strong>the wrong approach</strong>, how we build and ship Linux software in a way that actually works, what we think is responsible for Linux's binary compatibility problem and what needs to change to fix it.</p>
<h4>The latter part of this article will get deeply technical about what exactly the problem is and how it can be fixed.</h4>
<h2>Containers</h2>
<p>Tools like <a href="https://flatpak.org/">Flatpak</a>, <a href="https://appimage.org/">AppImage</a>, and similar solutions attempt to simplify shipping executables by creating "containers"—or as as we've recently taken to calling them, <strong>"a Linux Environment inside a Linux"</strong> Using Linux features like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_namespaces">namespaces</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroot">chroots</a>, these solutions package an entire Linux environment, complete with all required dependencies, into a single self-contained bundle. In extreme cases, this means shipping an entire Linux user-space just for one application.</p>
<p>One of the major challenges with these containerized solutions is that they
often don’t work well with applications that need to interact with the rest of
the system. To access hardware-accelerated APIs like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL">OpenGL</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulkan_(API)">Vulkan</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VDPAU">VDPAU</a> or
<a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone">CUDA</a>, an application must dynamically
link against the system's graphics driver libraries. Since these libraries exist
outside the container and cannot be shipped with the application, various
"pass-through" techniques have been developed to work around this, some of which
introduce runtime overhead (e.g., shimming libraries). Because containerized applications are isolated from the system, they often <strong>feel</strong> isolated too. This creates consistency issues, where the application may not recognize the user’s name, home directory, system settings, desktop environment preferences, or even have proper access to the filesystem.</p>
<p>To work around these limitations, many containerized environments rely on the
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/XDG_Desktop_Portal"><strong>XDG Desktop Portal</strong></a>
protocol, which introduces yet another layer of complexity. This system requires
IPC (inter-process communication) through
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D-Bus"><strong>DBus</strong></a> just to grant applications
access to basic system features like file selection, opening URLs, or reading
system settings—problems that wouldn’t exist if the application weren’t
artificially sandboxed in the first place.</p>
<p>We don’t believe that piling on more layers is an acceptable solution. As engineers, we need to stop and ask ourselves: "should we keep adding to this tower of Babel?", or is it time to peel back some of these abstractions and reevaluate them? At some point, the right solution isn’t more complexity—it’s less.</p>
<p>While containerized solutions can work under certain conditions, we believe that shipping lean, native executables—without containers—provides a more seamless and integrated experience that better aligns with user expectations.</p>
<h2>Versioning</h2>
<p>When you compile your application, it links against the specific library versions present on the build machine. This means that by default, the versions on a user's system may not match, causing compatibility issues. Let’s assume the user has all the necessary libraries installed, but the versions don’t match what your application was built against. This is where the real problem begins.
Short of shipping the exact machine used to deploy your application, how do you ensure compatibility with the versions installed on a user’s system?</p>
<p>We believe there are two ways to solve this problem, and we've given them our own names:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Replication Approach</strong> – This means bundling all the libraries from the build machine and shipping them with your application. This is the philosophy behind Flatpak and AppImage. We do <strong>not</strong> use this approach at JangaFX.</li>
<li><strong>Relaxation Approach</strong> – Instead of relying on specific or newer library versions, you link against versions that are so old they’re almost guaranteed to be compatible everywhere. This minimizes the risk of incompatibility on a user’s system.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first approach works well in cases where the necessary libraries may not exist on a user’s machine, but it fails for libraries that cannot be shipped (we call these "system libraries") The second approach is particularly effective for system libraries and is the approach we use at JangaFX.</p>
<h2>System Libraries</h2>
<p>There are various libraries present on a Linux machine that cannot be shipped because they are system libraries. These are libraries tied to the system itself and cannot be provided in a container. Typically these include things like user-space drivers for the GPU, enterprise installed components for security, and of course, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_standard_library">libc</a> itself.</p>
<p>If you’ve ever tried to distribute Linux binaries, you may have encountered an error message like this:</p>
<pre><code>/lib64/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.18' not found
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>For those unaware, <strong>glibc</strong> (GNU C Library) provides the C standard library, POSIX APIs, and the dynamic linker responsible for loading shared libraries, and itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>GLIBC is an example of a "system library" that cannot be bundled with your
application because it includes the dynamic linker itself. This linker is
responsible for loading other libraries, some of which may also depend on
GLIBC—but not always. Complicating matters further, since GLIBC is a dynamic
library, it must also load itself. This self-referential, chicken-and-egg
problem highlights GLIBC’s complexity and monolithic design, as it attempts to
fulfill multiple roles simultaneously. A large downside to this monolithic
design is that upgrading GLIBC often requires upgrading the entire system. Later in this article, we will
explain why this structure needs to change to truly solve Linux’s binary
compatibility problem.</p>
<p>Before you suggest statically linking GLIBC—<strong>that’s not an option.</strong> GLIBC relies on dynamic linking for features like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_Service_Switch">NSS</a> modules, which handle hostname resolution, user authentication, and network configuration, among other dynamically loaded components. Static linking breaks this because it does not include the dynamic linker, which is why GLIBC does not officially support it. Even if you managed to statically link GLIBC—or used an alternative like <a href="https://musl.libc.org/">musl</a>—your application would be unable to load any dynamic libraries at runtime. Static linking the dynamic linker itself is not possible, for reasons that will be explained later. In short, this would prevent your application from dynamically linking against any system libraries at all.</p>
<h2>Our Approach</h2>
<p>Since our application relies on many non-system libraries that may not be installed on the user’s system, we need a way to include them. The most straightforward approach is the <strong>Replication Approach</strong>, where we ship these libraries alongside our application. However, this negates the benefits of dynamic linking, such as shared memory usage and system-wide updates. In such cases, statically linking these libraries into the application is a better choice, as it eliminates dependency issues entirely. It also enables additional optimizations, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interprocedural_optimization">LTO</a>, and results in a smaller package by stripping unused components from the included libraries.</p>
<p>Instead, we take a different approach: <strong>statically linking everything we can</strong>. When doing so, special care is needed if a dependency embeds another dependency within its static library. We've encountered static libraries that include object files from other static libraries (e.g., libcurl), but we still need to link them separately. This duplication is conveniently avoided with dynamic libraries, but with static libraries, you may need to extract all object files from the archive and remove the embedded ones manually. Similarly, compiler runtimes like <code>libgcc</code> default to dynamic linking. We recommend using <code>-static-libgcc</code>.</p>
<p>Finally, when it comes to dealing with system libraries, we use the <strong>Relaxation Approach</strong>. Rather than requiring exact or newer versions of system libraries, we link against versions that are old enough to be nearly universally compatible. This increases the likelihood that the user’s system libraries will work with our application, reducing dependency issues without the need for containerization or bundling system components and shims.</p>
<p>The method we suggest when linking against older system libraries is to obtain a corresponding older Linux environment. You don’t need to install an old Linux version on physical hardware or even set up a full virtual machine. Instead, a <strong>chroot</strong> provides a lightweight, isolated environment within an existing Linux installation, allowing you to build against an older system without the overhead of full virtualization. Ironically, this suggests that containers were the right solution all along—just not at runtime, but at build time.</p>
<p>To achieve this, we use <a href="https://salsa.debian.org/installer-team/debootstrap">debootstrap</a>, an excellent script that creates a minimal Debian installation from scratch. Debian is particularly suited for this approach due to its stability and long-term support for older releases, making it a great choice for ensuring compatibility with older system libraries.</p>
<p>Of course, once you have an older Linux setup, you may find that its binary package toolchains are too outdated to build your software. To address this, we compile a modern LLVM toolchain from source and use it to build both our dependencies and our software. The details of this process are beyond the scope of this article.</p>
<p>Finally, we automate the entire debootstrap process with a Python script, which we've included here for reference.</p>

<h2>Fixing it</h2>
<p>Generally, most applications do not link directly against system libraries, and instead load which ever is present on the user's machine already at runtime. So while these libraries are considered system components, they typically have few system dependencies beyond libc itself. This is what makes libc—specifically <strong>GLIBC</strong>—the real source of compatibility issues, it's essentially the only system component directly linked against.</p>
<p>In just the past two years, our team has encountered three separate <strong>GLIBC-specific</strong> compatibility issues, each directly impacting our products:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=29456">https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=29456</a></li>
<li><a href="https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=32653">https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=32653</a></li>
<li><a href="https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=32786">https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=32786</a></li>
</ol>
<p>From our perspective, the core issue with <strong>GLIBC</strong> is that it tries to do far too much. It’s a massive, monolithic system that handles everything—from system calls and memory management to threading and even the dynamic linker. This tight coupling is why upgrading <strong>GLIBC</strong> often means upgrading the entire system; everything is intertwined. If it were broken into smaller, more focused components, users could update only the parts that change, rather than dragging their whole system along with it.</p>
<p>More importantly, separating the dynamic linker from the <strong>C library</strong> itself would allow multiple versions of <strong>libc</strong> to coexist, eliminating a major source of compatibility issues. This is exactly how <strong>Windows</strong> handles it, which is one of the reasons Windows maintains such strong binary compatibility. You can still run decades-old Windows software today because Microsoft doesn’t force everything to be tied to a single, ever-changing libc.</p>
<p>Of course, this isn’t as simple as just splitting things apart. GLIBC has deep cross-cutting concerns, particularly with threading, TLS (Thread-Local Storage), and global memory management.</p>
<p>For example, even if you managed to get two versions of GLIBC to coexist, returning allocated memory from one and attempting to free it in another would likely lead to serious issues. Their heaps would be unaware of each other, potentially using different allocation strategies, causing unpredictable failures. To avoid this, even the heap would likely need to be separated into its own dedicated <strong>libheap</strong>.</p>
<p>We think a better approach would be breaking GLIBC into distinct libraries, something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>libsyscall</strong> – Handles making system calls and nothing else. This is
provided as a static library only. Used by <code>libheap</code>, <code>libthread</code> and <code>libc</code> to gain access to shared system call code. Since it's static it's embedded in all three. You can pretend this library otherwise does not exist.</li>
<li><strong>libdl (Dynamic Linker)</strong> – A standalone linker that loads shared libraries.
Links only against <code>libsyscall</code> statically. Is a true, free-standing library, depending on nothing. Provided as both a static and dynamic library. When you link against it statically you can still load things with it dynamically. You just end up with a dynamic linker inside your executable.</li>
<li><strong>libheap</strong> - The single heap shared by all below. Links against <code>libsyscall</code>
statically. Provided only as a dynamic library. Cannot ever be linked against statically.</li>
<li><strong>libthread</strong> – Deals with threading and TLS, links against
<code>libheap</code>. Provided only as a dynamic library. Cannot ever be linked against statically.</li>
<li><strong>libc</strong> – Links against <code>libthread</code>, and thus <code>libheap</code>, and <code>libdl</code> transitively. Provided as both a static and dynamic library. When linking statically it links <code>libdl</code> statically. The linking of <code>libthread</code> and <code>libheap</code> is always done dynamically though through the included <code>libdl</code> if linked statically or through <code>libdl</code> program loader if linked dynamically.</li>
</ul>
<p>These libraries would be aware of each other and allow multiple versions to
coexist in the same address space. That way, we don’t end up with this brittle
mess where upgrading GLIBC can break everything. The actual structure would look
something like</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This architecture is quite similar to Windows, where the equivalents of
<code>libsyscall</code>, <code>libdl</code>, <code>libheap</code>, and <code>libthread</code> are all bundled within a single
<code>kernel32.dll</code>. This DLL is pre-mapped and automatically loaded into the
address space of every executable on Windows.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><strong>Statically Linked <code>libc</code></strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Application statically links <code>libc</code> and <code>libdl</code> (it is not the program loader).</li>
<li>Application starts execution and dynamically loads <code>libheap</code> and <code>libthread</code> using embedded <code>libdl</code>.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>[Application]

<li><code>libc</code> and <code>libdl</code> are embedded in the executable, meaning the application itself starts execution.</li>

<hr>
<h3><strong>Dynamically Linked <code>libc</code></strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Application starts execution via the program interpreter (<code>libdl</code>).</li>
<li><code>libdl</code> (program loader) loads the application and resolves dependencies.</li>
<li>Application dynamically links <code>libc</code>, <code>libheap</code>, and <code>libthread</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>Comparison Table</strong></h3>
<table><thead><tr><th>Scenario</th><th><code>libdl</code> (included by)</th><th><code>libc</code> (how it loads)</th><th><code>libthread</code> (via <code>libdl</code>)</th><th><code>libheap</code> (via <code>libdl</code>)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Static <code>libc</code></strong></td><td>Static linking</td><td>Static linking</td><td><strong>Linked by <code>libdl</code></strong></td><td><strong>Linked by <code>libdl</code></strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Dynamic <code>libc</code></strong></td><td>Program interpreter</td><td><strong>Linked by <code>libdl</code></strong></td><td><strong>Linked by <code>libdl</code></strong></td><td><strong>Linked by <code>libdl</code></strong></td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>This architecture effectively reduces the binary compatibility problem to two key <strong>system libraries</strong>: <code>libheap</code> and <code>libthread</code>. These cannot be statically linked because they manage shared resources critical to the entire system.</p>
<p>The reason is straightforward—heap memory must be shared across all components, ensuring compatibility between allocations and deallocations. Similarly, TLS and threading require a unified system-wide approach, as they involve complex initialization and finalization logic, particularly for global constructors and destructors. However, these components are relatively small and stable, meaning they undergo fewer changes that would necessitate version updates.</p>
<h2>Questioning it</h2>
<p>This is, of course, a non-trivial amount of rearchitecting, which naturally raises the question: why is libc implemented the way it is instead of this alternative approach?</p>
<p>Setting historical reasons aside, attempting to solve this problem quickly
becomes difficult the moment you start writing any code using libc. Here is a trivial example of the issues that arise when trying to support multiple
versions of libc.</p>
<p>Suppose you have a dynamic library that contains the following C code.</p>
<pre><p><code><span>#</span><span>include</span><span> </span><span>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span>FILE</span><span>*</span><span> </span><span>open_thing</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>fopen</span><span>(</span><span>"thing.bin"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>"r"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>}</span></code></p></pre>
<p>And your application links against this library and calls <code>open_thing</code>. Your application would be responsible for calling <code>fclose</code> on the returned <code>FILE*</code>. If your code links against a different version of libc from the version the library links against, then it would be calling the wrong implementation of <code>fclose</code>!</p>
<p>Suppose though, that libc was written in such a way that the <code>FILE*</code> returned always required a version field or a pointer to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_method_table">vtable</a> containing the implementation of <code>fclose</code> (and other functions) and every version of libc agreed on this so that it could always call the correct one across this ABI boundary. This would solve this compatibility issue, but now lets say your code calls <code>fflush</code>.</p>
<pre><p><code><span>// Defined in header &lt;stdio.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>int</span><span> </span><span>fflush</span><span>(</span><span>FILE </span><span>*</span><span>fp</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></p></pre>
<p>Except it doesn't flush the file, and instead passes <code>NULL</code>.</p>
<pre><p><code><span>fflush</span><span>(</span><span>NULL</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></p></pre>
<p>If you're not familiar with C's <code>fflush</code> function, passing <code>NULL</code> to it requires flushing all open files (every <code>FILE*</code>). However, in this scenario, it would only flush files seen by the libc version your application is linked against, not those opened by other libc versions (such as the one used by <code>open_thing</code>).</p>
<p>To handle this correctly, each libc version would need a way to enumerate files across all other libc instances, including dynamically loaded ones, ensuring that every file is visited exactly once without forming cycles. This enumeration must also be thread-safe. Additionally, while enumeration is in progress, another libc could be dynamically loaded (e.g., via <code>dlopen</code>) on a separate thread, or a new file could be opened (e.g., a global constructor in a dynamically loaded library calling <code>fopen</code>).</p>
<p>This global list of things owned by libc shows up in multiple places. Take for instance:</p>
<pre><p><code><span>// Defined in header &lt;stdlib.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>int</span><span> </span><span>atexit</span><span>(</span><span>void</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>func</span><span>)</span><span>(</span><span>void</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></p></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Registers the function pointed to by <em>func</em> to be called on normal program termination (via <code>exit()</code> or returning from <code>main()</code>). The functions will be called in reverse order they were registered, i.e. the function registered last will be executed first.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There is also another variant of this called <code>at_quick_exit</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This implies that somewhere within libc, there must be a list of functions registered via <code>atexit</code> that need to be executed in reverse order. For multiple libc implementations to coexist, any system handling <code>atexit</code> must not only enumerate and call all registered functions, but also establish a total order for how they were inserted across all instances of libc.</p>
<p>Essentially, any resource owned by one libc would need to be sharable and accessible from any other version of libc. This turns out to be quite a lot of things. For the sake of our argument we've actually gone through all of the standard C (not POSIX) functions which produce or operate on a resource which has an opaque implementation where careful considerations would need to be made.</p>

<p>Most defines (of constants), ABI-exposed types (and typedefs) should just be stable across libc implementations for this to work reliably. Since these are baked into executables there's no real way to modify or change them without breaking stuff anyways. When discussing stuff that is opaque (listed as <code>Any opaque method</code>) we propose affixing a pointer to a vtable containing the implementation as the first value in the type, this way functions operating on it can always recover the correct implementation and dispatch it indirectly through the vtable. Other methods like using a version field can also work here too.</p>
<p>Regardless, certain aspects of libc introduce complexity, particularly global and thread-local elements like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Errno.h">errno</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locale_(computer_software)">locale</a>. However, with a well-designed architecture, these challenges can be effectively addressed.</p>
<p>Memory allocation functions—<code>calloc</code>, <code>malloc</code>, <code>aligned_alloc</code>, <code>realloc</code>, and <code>free</code>—from <code>&lt;stdlib.h&gt;</code> pose another difficulty. Since they can return any pointer, tracking them is non-trivial. One possible approach is to store a pointer to a vtable in the allocation header, allowing each allocation to reference its implementation. However, this method incurs significant performance and memory overhead. Instead, we propose centralizing heap management in a dedicated <code>libheap</code>. This would also contain implementation of the POSIX extensions like <code>posix_memalign</code>.</p>
<p>Things get even more interesting when moving from standard C to POSIX, which introduces unique challenges that require libc support. Some of these functionalities might be better split into separate libraries (for example, why is the DNS resolver in libc?). Among these challenges though, <code>setxid</code> stands out.</p>
<p>For those unfamiliar, permissions in POSIX—such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_identifier">real, effective, and saved user/group IDs</a>—apply at the process level. However, Linux treats threads as independent processes that share memory, meaning these permissions are managed per thread rather than per process. To comply with POSIX semantics, libc must interrupt every thread, forcing them to execute code that invokes the system call to modify their thread-local permissions. This must be done atomically, without failure, and while remaining <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/signal-safety.7.html">async-signal safe</a>. This is a nightmare to implement and has proven to be <a href="https://ewontfix.com/17/">a major challenge</a>. More importantly, getting it right is crucial for security.</p>
<p>Ultimately, this means libc must track every thread and provide a way to synchronously execute code across all threads. To address this, we propose consolidating threading, TLS, and the necessary POSIX compliance mechanisms within a single <code>libthread</code>.</p>
<p>There are many additional complexities we’ve glossed over and many alternative ways this can be implemented. The key takeaway is that these issues are solvable—they just require significant architectural changes. This necessitates reevaluating this aspect of the Linux userspace from the ground up with binary compatibility as a core design principle. GLIBC has never seriously attempted this. Until someone decides, "enough is enough, let’s fix this," binary compatibility on Linux will remain an unsolved problem; we strongly believe this is a problem worth solving.</p></div></div>]]></description>
