<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div role="main" id="maincontent"><article expanded="true"><div data-io-article-url="/2025/02/21/apple-pulls-encrypted-icloud-security-feature-uk/"><p>Apple has withdrawn its Advanced Data Protection iCloud feature from the United Kingdom following government demands for backdoor access to encrypted user data, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-21/apple-removes-end-to-end-encryption-feature-from-uk-after-backdoor-order"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>. The move comes after UK officials secretly ordered Apple to provide unrestricted access to encrypted iCloud content worldwide.</p>
<p><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/t/DJt4yhlUGQL70lVg5j2lXcCiu10=/400x0/article-new/2025/02/iCloud-Versus-UK-Key-Feature.jpg?lossy" srcset="https://images.macrumors.com/t/DJt4yhlUGQL70lVg5j2lXcCiu10=/400x0/article-new/2025/02/iCloud-Versus-UK-Key-Feature.jpg?lossy 400w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/wvBp_HGYzUZeneatDI1358r-HVg=/800x0/article-new/2025/02/iCloud-Versus-UK-Key-Feature.jpg?lossy 800w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/a9cMrXLU2fJN_7zb0__5cvQFIeo=/1600x0/article-new/2025/02/iCloud-Versus-UK-Key-Feature.jpg 1600w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/0TD9k13MPLmH0gwTFeVngM_zIs4=/2500x0/filters:no_upscale()/article-new/2025/02/iCloud-Versus-UK-Key-Feature.jpg 2500w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 697px" alt="iCloud Versus UK Key Feature" width="2500" height="1406"><br>Customers who are already using Advanced Data Protection, or ADP, will need to manually disable it during an unspecified grace period to keep their iCloud accounts, according to the report. Apple said it will issue additional guidance in the future to affected users and that it "does not have the ability to automatically disable it on their behalf."</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/07/uk-government-orders-access-icloud/">UK government's demand</a> came through a "technical capability notice" under the Investigatory Powers Act (IPA), requiring Apple to create a backdoor that would allow British security officials to access encrypted user data globally. The order would have compromised Apple's Advanced Data Protection feature, which provides end-to-end encryption for iCloud data including Photos, Notes, Messages backups, and device backups.<br>
</p>
<blockquote><p>"We are gravely disappointed that the protections provided by ADP will not be available to our customers in the UK given the continuing rise of data breaches and other threats to customer privacy," Apple said in a statement. "ADP protects iCloud data with end-to-end encryption, which means the data can only be decrypted by the user who owns it, and only on their trusted devices."</p></blockquote>
<p>Apple's decision to pull the feature rather than comply with the UK's demands is consistent with the company's previous statements that it would consider withdrawing encrypted services from the UK rather than compromise security. Apple has long opposed creating backdoors in its products, maintaining that such access points would inevitably be discovered by malicious actors.</p>

Additionally, the IPA makes it illegal for companies to disclose the existence of such government demands.</p>
<p>US security agencies, including the FBI and NSA, have been advocating for increased use of encryption to protect against Chinese cyber threats, creating potential conflicts between UK and US security interests.</p>
<p>"Enhancing the security of cloud storage with end-to-end encryption is more urgent than ever before,” said Apple on Friday, per <em>Bloomberg</em>. The company added that it "remains committed to offering our users the highest level of security for their personal data and are hopeful that we will be able to do so in the future in the United Kingdom."</p>
<p>Note that the loss of Advanced Data Protection in the UK does not affect the existing end-to-end encryption of several other Apple features available in the country, including iMessage, FaceTime, password management and health data.</p>

<p>These IDs help you stay organised. They impose constraints that make it harder to get lost. And you create your own index to link everything in your life together.</p>
<p>The system is free to use and the concepts are the same at home, work, or that club you manage.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem">The problem</h2>
<p>In real life, if you stored your stuff in piles of badly-labelled boxes you'd never find anything again.</p>
<p>If you put <em>those</em> boxes in boxes, in boxes, you'd never know which box to open to find the next box. It would be chaos. But this is how you save your computer files.</p>

<h2 id="the-solution">The solution</h2>
<p>Here's one way to think about how a Johnny.Decimal system works. In this simple analogy, an area is a shelf, a category is a box, and an ID is a manila folder.</p>
<h3 id="step-1-buy-ten-shelves">Step 1: Buy ten shelves</h3>
<p>Imagine a computer is a garage. We can't put everything on the floor, so we buy ten shelves. Then we dedicate each one to an area of our life -- <code>life admin</code>, <code>home business</code>, and <code>tennis club</code>.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-room-to-grow" id="user-content-fnref-room-to-grow" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup></p>

A SHELF FOR EACH MAJOR AREA OF OUR LIFE.</figcaption> </picture> 
<h3 id="step-2-add-some-boxes">Step 2: Add some boxes</h3>
<p>Each shelf has space for ten boxes, so we categorise what we want to store. In life admin we decide on five and label them: <code>me</code>, <code>house</code>, <code>money</code>, <code>online</code>, and <code>travel</code>. Our boxes have space for a number, so we add that too.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-startat11" id="user-content-fnref-startat11" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup></p>

<h3 id="step-3-file-your-stuff-in-folders">Step 3: File your stuff in folders</h3>
<p>We put our documents in manila folders. Each folder gets a number starting at <code>.11</code> so we can track them. In this case, we've put some insurance policies in <code>15.23 Travel insurance</code>. Then put the folder in a box.</p>

<h3 id="this-is-how-we-structure-our-file-system">This is how we structure our file system</h3>
<p>Let's return to our computer. The shelves have become our area folders. The boxes are category folders. And the manila folders are the IDs where we save our files.</p>

A NEAT FILE STRUCTURE WITH AREAS, CATEGORIES, AND IDS.</figcaption> </picture> 
<h2 id="benefits-of-the-johnnydecimal-id">Benefits of the Johnny.Decimal ID</h2>
<p>Each of our storage folders now has a number, the ID. It always has two digits, a decimal, and two digits. For example, <code>15.23</code> <code>22.11</code> <code>31.17</code>. This number is really useful.</p>
<h3 id="it-provides-structure">It provides structure</h3>
<p>The ID tells us exactly where a thing is. The numbers before the decimal are the item's category, and they define the structure of your system.</p>
<p>At a glance, you know what sort of thing the item contains. You'll be astonished at how many of your category numbers you remember.</p>
<h3 id="theyre-easy-to-communicate">They're easy to communicate</h3>
<p>They're short, memorable, and can be spoken out loud. Say it like "sixteen oh-two" or "thirty-one dot seventeen".</p>
<p>This is really handy when you want to tell someone (including your future self) where a thing is.</p>
<h3 id="things-stay-where-they-are">Things stay where they are</h3>
<p>If you use the alphabet to name folders, they move when a new one is created. So you never get a chance to develop muscle memory.</p>
<p>Numbers solve this problem. In the example above, <code>11 Me</code> comes before <code>12 House</code> because the folders sort by number. If we made a new folder, <code>16 Aardvark collection</code>, nothing would move.</p>
<h3 id="it-imposes-limits">It imposes limits</h3>
<p>The 'no more than ten' concept is at the heart of Johnny.Decimal.</p>
<p>When you start looking for something, you have no more than ten area folders to choose from. Select one and ignore the rest. Now you have no more than ten category folders to choose from. Repeat the process.</p>
<p>You then arrive in a folder with no more than one hundred IDs. If the ID was created recently it will have a higher number. If not, lower. And things created together, stick together. The alphabet isn't around to ruin the party.</p>

In the months between November 5 and January 20, members of DOGE including Steve Davis (president of Musk’s Boring Company) and the young engineer Luke Farritor were operating out of the company’s DC office, according to a source with knowledge.</p><p>The company did not respond to questions about whether these employees will retain their salaries and positions at the company during their time with DOGE. Many of the so-called department’s operatives have joined as “special government employees,” who are limited to working 130 days in a year. Last week <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/musk-krause-treasury-bfs-conflict-of-interest/">WIRED reported</a> that Tom Krause, a DOGE operative at the Treasury Department, would continue to maintain his position as CEO of the Cloud Software Group while also performing the duties of fiscal assistant secretary.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I still often find myself in discussions where the main focus is the choice of technologies. Questions like <em>“Is this language better than that one?”</em> or <em>“Is this framework more performant than the other?”</em> keep coming up.

They won’t notice those extra 10 milliseconds you saved, nor will their experience magically improve just because you’re using the latest JavaScript framework.</p>
<p>What truly makes a difference for users is your attention to the <strong>product</strong> and their <strong>needs</strong>.</p>
<p>Every programming language shines in specific contexts. Every framework is born to solve certain problems. But none of these technical decisions, in isolation, will define the success of your product from a user’s perspective.</p>

<p>Don’t get swept up by the hype. Sure, set aside time to explore new technologies that catch your interest, but don’t fall into the trap of thinking that building a great product requires the same stack featured in the latest YouTube tutorial from your favorite tech influencer.</p>

      A peer who downloads more data than they upload on torrenting networks is known as a "leech"  sucking up data without contributing to the swarm.

          <p>Just because Meta admitted to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/02/meta-torrented-over-81-7tb-of-pirated-books-to-train-ai-authors-say/">torrenting a dataset of pirated books for AI training</a> purposes, that doesn't necessarily mean that Meta seeded the file after downloading it, the social media company claimed in a <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Kadrey-v-Meta-Reply-In-Support-of-Motion-to-Dismiss-2-20-25.pdf">court filing</a> this week.</p>
<p>Evidence instead shows that Meta "took precautions not to 'seed' any downloaded files," Meta's filing said. Seeding refers to sharing a torrented file after the download completes, and because there's allegedly no proof of such "seeding," Meta insisted that authors cannot prove Meta shared the pirated books with anyone during the torrenting process.</p>
<p>Whether or not Meta actually seeded the pirated books could make a difference in a copyright lawsuit from book authors including Richard Kadrey, Sarah Silverman, and Ta-Nehisi Coates. Authors had previously alleged that Meta unlawfully copied and distributed their works through AI outputs—an increasingly common complaint that so far has barely been litigated. But Meta's admission to torrenting appears to add a more straightforward claim of unlawful distribution of copyrighted works through illegal torrenting, which has long been considered established case-law.</p>
<p>Authors have <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.415175/gov.uscourts.cand.415175.426.0.pdf">alleged</a> that "Meta deliberately engaged in one of the largest data piracy campaigns in history to acquire text data for its LLM training datasets, torrenting and sharing dozens of terabytes of pirated data that altogether contain many millions of copyrighted works." Separate from their copyright infringement claims opposing Meta's AI training on pirated copies of their books, authors alleged that Meta torrenting the dataset was "independently illegal" under California's Computer Data Access and Fraud Act (CDAFA), which allegedly "prevents the unauthorized taking of data, including copyrighted works."</p>
<p>Meta, however, is hoping to convince the court that torrenting is not in and of itself illegal, but is, rather, a "widely-used protocol to download large files." According to Meta, the decision to download the pirated books dataset from pirate libraries like LibGen and Z-Library was simply a move to access "data from a 'well-known online repository' that was publicly available via torrents."</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>To defend its torrenting, Meta has basically scrubbed the word "pirate" from the characterization of its activity. The company alleges that authors can't claim that Meta gained unauthorized access to their data under CDAFA. Instead, all they can claim is that "Meta allegedly accessed and downloaded datasets that Plaintiffs did not create, containing the text of published books that anyone can read in a public library, from public websites Plaintiffs do not operate or own."</p>
<p>While Meta may claim there's no evidence of seeding, there is some testimony that might be compelling to the court. Previously, a Meta executive in charge of project management, Michael Clark, had <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.415175/gov.uscourts.cand.415175.417.8.pdf">testified</a> that Meta allegedly modified torrenting settings "so that the smallest amount of seeding possible could occur," which seems to support authors' claims that some seeding occurred. And an internal <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.415175/gov.uscourts.cand.415175.417.9.pdf">message</a> from Meta researcher Frank Zhang appeared to show that Meta allegedly tried to conceal the seeding by not using Facebook servers while downloading the dataset to "avoid" the "risk" of anyone "tracing back the seeder/downloader" from Facebook servers. Once this information came to light, authors asked the court for a chance to depose Meta executives again, alleging that new facts "contradict prior deposition testimony."</p>
<h2>Torrenting terminology may confuse court</h2>
<p>How successful Meta's torrenting defense will be is still up in the air, but authors pointed out that even if Meta somehow managed to avoid seeding any of the torrented books, the social media giant still participated in an "online piracy ring." Further, in a footnote, the authors told the court that "IP pirates like Meta also upload or share files with others during (leeching) and after (seeding) downloading." Additionally, TorrentFreak <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/meta-says-it-made-sure-not-to-seed-any-pirated-books/">noted</a> that Meta "taking precautions is not the same as preventing" seeding.</p>

        <div>
          
          
<p>Authors will likely push to persuade the court that merely by torrenting the file, Meta made "pirated works available to other users worldwide" while making it clear that even Meta can't claim to have prevented all seeding. A lawyer representing the authors declined to comment on whether ongoing discovery may surface more evidence to help prove the seeding claims. Lack of evidence could be a problem since TorrentFreak suggested the torrenting terminology may be foreign to the court, potentially muddying what authors feel otherwise is a straightforward claim that Meta allegedly knew it was violating laws by torrenting the pirated books.</p>
<p>Meta has been silent so far on claims about sharing data while "leeching" (downloading) but told the court it plans to fight the seeding claims at summary judgment.</p>
<p>At this time, Meta has moved to dismiss the authors' CDAFA claim as being preempted by copyright law, but unsurprisingly, the authors told the court that they strongly disagree.</p>
<p>"Had Meta bought Plaintiffs’ works in a bookstore or borrowed them from a library and then trained its LLMs on them without a license, it would have committed copyright infringement, but no CDAFA violation," the authors alleged. "Meta’s decision to bypass lawful acquisition methods and become a knowing participant in an illegal peer-to-peer piracy network provides the 'extra element' and is 'qualitatively different' to establish an independent CDAFA violation."</p>
<p>Authors further linked the CDAFA claim to their copyright infringement claim opposing Meta's AI training. They alleged that by torrenting their works "from pirated databases in lieu of executing lawful licensing arrangements, Meta not only deprived Plaintiffs of that licensing revenue, but it also deprived Plaintiffs of additional revenue they could have generated from 'other users worldwide' because Meta simultaneously made the copyrighted works available to download by any interested Internet user in the process of acquiring Plaintiffs’ data" to train AI.</p>
<p>Meta did not immediately respond to Ars' request for comment.</p>

infrastructure. This limit applies to all requests to Hub properties including
web pages, APIs, and image pulls. The limit is applied per IPv4 address or per
IPv6 /64 subnet, and while the limit changes over time depending on load and
other factors, it's in the order of thousands of requests per minute. The abuse
limit applies to all users equally regardless of account level.</p><p>You can differentiate between the pull rate limit and abuse rate limit by
looking at the error code. The abuse limit returns a simple <code>429 Too Many Requests</code> response. The pull limit returns a longer error message that includes

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article role="main">
        <p>This week, I was thrilled to read about <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2021/6/252840-collusion-rings-threaten-the-integrity-of-computer-science-research/fulltext#FNA">the first well-documented case of explicit academic fraud in the artificial intelligence community</a>.
I hope that this is the beginning of a trend, and that other researchers will be inspired by their example and follow up by engaging in even more blatant forms of fraud in the future.</p>

<p>Explicit academic fraud is, of course, the natural extension of the sort of mundane, day-to-day fraud that most academics in our community commit on a regular basis.
Trying that shiny new algorithm out on a couple dozen seeds, and then only reporting the best few.
Running a big hyperparameter sweep on your proposed approach but using the defaults for the baseline.
Cherry-picking examples where your model looks good, or cherry-picking whole datasets to test on, where you’ve confirmed your model’s advantage.
Making up new problem settings, new datasets, new objectives in order to claim victory on an empty playing field.
Proclaiming that your work is a “promising first step” in your introduction, despite being fully aware that nobody will ever build on it.
Submitting a paper to a conference because it’s got a decent shot at acceptance and you don’t want the time you spent on it go to waste, even though you’ve since realized that the core ideas aren’t quite correct.</p>

<p>The problem with this sort of low-key fraud is that it’s insidious, it’s subtle.
In many ways, a fraudulent action is indistinguishable from a simple mistake.
There is plausible deniability – oh, I simply forgot to include those seeds, I didn’t have enough compute for those other ablations, I didn’t manage to catch that bug.
It’s difficult to bring ourselves to punish a well-meaning grad student for something that could plausibly have been a simple mistake, so we let these things slide, and slide and slide until they have become normalized.
When standards are low, it’s to no individual’s advantage to hold themselves to a higher bar.
Newcomers to the field see these things, they learn, and they imitate.
Often, they are directly encouraged by mentors.
A graduate student who publishes three papers a year is every professor’s dream, so strategies for maximal paper output become lab culture.
And when virtually every lab endorses certain behaviors, they become integral to the research standards of the field.</p>

<p>But worst of all: because everybody is complicit in this subtle fraud, nobody is willing to acknowledge its existence.
Who would be such a hypocrite as to condemn in others, behaviors they can see clearly in themselves?
And yet, who is willing to undermine their own achievements by admitting that their own work does not have scientific value?<sup id="fnref:0" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:0" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>
The sad result is that, as a community, we have developed a collective blind-spot around a depressing reality: even at top conferences, the median published paper contains no truth or insight.
Any attempts to highlight or remedy the situation are met with harsh resistance from those who benefit from the current state of affairs.
The devil himself could not have designed a better impediment to humanity’s progression.</p>

<p>But now that blatant academic fraud is in the mix, the AI community has a fighting chance.
By partaking in a form of fraud that has left the Overton window of acceptability, the researchers in the collusion ring have finally succeeded in forcing the community to acknowledge its blind spot.
For the first time, researchers reading conference proceedings will be forced to wonder: does this work truly merit my attention?
Or is its publication simply the result of fraud?</p>

<p>It would, of course, be quite difficult to actually distinguish the papers published fraudlently from the those published “legitimately”.
(That fact alone tells you all you really need to know about the current state of AI research.)
But the mere <em>possibility</em> that any given paper was published through fraud forces people to engage more skeptically with <em>all</em> published work.
Readers are forced to act more like reviewers, weighing the evidence presented against their priors, attempting to identify ways in which surprising conclusions could be the result of fraud – explicit or subtle – rather than fact.
People will apply additional scrutiny to deal with explicit forms of fraud like collusion rings, but in doing so will also develop a sensitivity to the more subtle forms of fraud that are already endemic to the community.
This will, in turn, put pressure on authors to produce work which can withstand such scrutiny; results obtained without any fraud at all, leading to publications with genuine scientific merit.</p>

<p>That same harsh light is also cast on ourselves, on our motivations.
This situation seems to have evoked in many researchers feelings of empathy.
These actions are understandable; such an occurrence was inevitable; everyone does this, just more discreetly.
We are not surprised that people behave unscientifically in order to get their papers published; we are surprised that someone was willing to take it this far.
The most notable thing about the collusion ring is not that it was more fraudulent than is typical, but that the fraud was more <em>intentional</em>.</p>

<p>This surfaces the fundamental tension between good science and career progression buried deep at the heart of academia.
Most researchers are to some extent “career researchers”, motivated by the power and prestige that rewards those who excel in the academic system, rather than idealistic pursuit of scientific truth.
Well-respected senior figures are no exception to this. (In fact, due to selection effects, I suspect most are actually <em>more</em> career-motivated than is typical.)
We must come to terms with the fact that, since the incentives for career progression are not perfectly aligned with good science, almost any action motivated by career progression will interfere with one’s ability to do good science.
We must encourage a norm of introspection, of probing one’s own motivations, where any decisions made to obtain science-adjacent benefits are viewed with the deepest suspicion.
And we must ensure that explicit suggestions to modify one’s science in the service of one’s career – “you need to do X to be published”, “you need to publish Y to graduate”, “you need to avoid criticizing Z to get hired” – carry social penalties as severe as a suggestion of plagiarism or fraud.</p>

<hr>

<p>Prof. Littman says that collusion rings threaten the integrity of computer science research.
I agree with him.
<em>And I am looking forward to the day they make good on that threat.</em>
Undermining the credibility of computer science research is the best possible outcome for the field, since the institution in its current form does not deserve the credibility that it has.
Widespread fraud would force us to re-strengthen our community’s academic norms, transforming the way we do research, and improving our collective ability to progress humanity’s knowledge.</p>

<p>So this is a call to action: <strong>please commit more academic fraud</strong>.</p>

<p><em>Blatant</em> fraud.
<em>Aggressive</em> fraud.
Form more collusion rings!
Blackmail your reviewers, bribe your ACs!
Fudge your results – or fabricate them entirely!
(But don’t skimp on the writing: your paper needs to be written in perfect academic English, formatted nicely, and tell an intuitive, plausible-sounding story.)
Let’s make explicit academic fraud commonplace enough to cast doubt into the minds of every scientist reading an AI paper.
Overall, science will benefit.</p>

<hr>

<p>Together, we can force the community to reckon with its own shortcomings, and develop stronger, better, and more scientific norms.
It is a harsh treatment, to be sure – a chemotherapy regimen that risks destroying us entirely.
But this is our best shot at destroying the cancer that has infected our community.
I believe with all my heart that we can make it through this challenge and emerge stronger than ever.
And when we do, the secrets to artificial intelligence will be waiting.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
    
<p><a id="_msocom_1"></a><span>The “Department of</span> Government Efficiency” claimed to have saved the American taxpayer nearly $232 million by canceling an IT contract for the Social Security Administration.</p>



<p>They were only off by about $231 million.</p>



<p>In fact, the government cut only $560,000, a paltry savings generated by yet another Trump administration anti-trans attack: the elimination of a project to develop an&nbsp;“X” gender marker for the agency’s internal databases. The Social Security Administration Wednesday confirmed the discrepancy between the DOGE claims and the actual total, which was first uncovered by The Intercept.&nbsp;</p>



<p>DOGE’s mixed-up math came as no surprise to Dylan Hedtler-Gaudette, the director of government affairs at the Project on Government Oversight, who <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/02/17/elon-musk-x-target-critics-federal-employees/">testified before the House DOGE subcommittee last week</a> about the shortcomings of the Elon Musk effort.</p>



<p>“This, to me, is just part and parcel of the amateur-hour nature of what DOGE is doing,” he told The Intercept. “They’re going to destroy more than they help. It’s absolutely counterproductive.”</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>“They’re going to destroy more than they help.”</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>When Musk’s “Department of Governmental Efficiency” — officially the<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/establishing-and-implementing-the-presidents-department-of-government-efficiency/"> U.S. DOGE Service Temporary Organization</a> —&nbsp;was first announced in November, it seemed like little more than a stunt. Immediately following Trump’s inauguration, however, the initiative sprang into action with murky processes and unclear outcomes. The Social Security contract snafu is just the latest example of confusion spread by Musk and DOGE as they boast of big cuts that vanish upon closer inspection.</p>



<p>On Monday, in response to criticisms from Democrats that the entity was not producing evidence to back up Musk’s extravagant claims of success, DOGE first posted its “wall of receipts,” an effort billed as follow-through on promises of transparency.</p>



<p>The rollout since then has been anything but smooth. On Tuesday, the New York Times reported that one claim of having saved $8 billion by axing a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement contract was wildly incorrect, since the underlying contract<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/18/upshot/doge-contracts-musk-trump.html?unlocked_article_code=1.yE4.tMCF.sFNRSzBm1a3M&amp;smid=nytcore-ios-share&amp;referringSource=articleShare"> only amounted to $8 million.</a></p>



<p>On Wednesday, other media outlets such as CNN <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/19/politics/doge-canceled-contracts-8-billion-invs/index.html">picked apart</a> DOGE’s claim to have saved $1.9 billion from USAID contracts — the hypothetical maximum of contracts that have so far only cost the government $55 million over several years.</p>



<!-- BLOCK(cta)[0](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22CTA%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) -->

<!-- END-BLOCK(cta)[0] -->



<h2 id="h-the-cut-that-wasn-t"><strong>The Cut That Wasn’t</strong></h2>



<p>The mislabeling of savings from cuts to the Social Security Administration stem from apparent confusion — or misdirection by DOGE — around a massive IT contract with Leidos, a Fortune 500 company that also contracts for <a href="https://theintercept.com/2016/12/06/defense-companies-trump/">defense</a> and intelligence agencies.</p>



<p>Since 2018, Leidos has billed $1.5 billion to the Social Security Administration through an overarching contract that currently has a ceiling of $1.9 billion.</p>



<p>On the surface, the contract’s goals of <a href="https://www.washingtontechnology.com/companies/2023/01/leidos-secures-15b-social-security-it-work/382077/">upgrading Social Security software systems</a> seem to align with Musk’s stated concerns about outdated technology.</p>



<p>Still, DOGE claimed that it had taken a hatchet to the contract, in the process slashing $231,864,794 in government spending.</p>



<!-- BLOCK(newsletter)[1](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22NEWSLETTER%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) -->

<!-- END-BLOCK(newsletter)[1] -->



<p>The actual savings were limited to the funds allocated to the Gender X Marker project, and were orders of magnitude smaller: According to a Social Security spokesperson, DOGE snipped a grand total of $560,000. Somehow, by the time that cut appeared on the “wall of receipts,” the amount it purported to save the government had ballooned by hundreds of millions.</p>



<p>“The task order referenced on the DOGE receipt website includes numerous IT development efforts, one of which was Social Security’s former Gender X Marker project,” said the spokesperson, Darren Lutz. “While the overarching task order was not terminated, we continue to assess and identify other projects under this task order that may be cancelled or streamlined to create further cost savings.”</p>



  



<p>The cancellation of the Gender X Marker project was first reported earlier this month, when DOGE <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/social-security-terminates-gender-x-marker-saving-taxpayers-over-1m-doge">claimed that it would save over $1 million</a>. DOGE said at the time that the project was eliminated in line with Trump’s executive order stating the government would only recognize “two sexes, male and female” — a frequent right-wing anti-trans talking point that has <a href="https://theintercept.com/2025/01/22/trump-anti-trans-gender-executive-order/">no grounding in biological science.</a></p>



<p>In response to questions about the Social Security contract from The Intercept, a White House spokesperson gave a general defense of Musk’s work.</p>



<p>“DOGE has already identified billions of dollars in savings for American taxpayers,” said press secretary Karoline Leavitt, “and President Trump will continue to direct this effort until our government is truly for the people, and by the people.”</p>







<p>DOGE’s “receipts” about the Social Security Administration contract came as its co-creator, Musk, began <a href="https://apnews.com/article/social-security-payments-deceased-false-claims-doge-ed2885f5769f368853ac3615b4852cf7">spreading false claims about the crucial old-age program</a>, alarming Democrats who saw his jawboning as a prelude to benefit cuts.</p>



<p>Congressional Democrats say they are alarmed in particular by DOGE’s attempts to access recipient data, which <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/17/doge-social-security-musk/">prompted the agency’s acting administrator to leave her job </a>over the weekend.</p>



<p>Rep. John Larson, D-Conn., said he had yet to see meaningful information about what DOGE has been up to.</p>



<p>“They seem to be operating with impunity under the leadership of an unelected, unaccountable billionaire,” he said. “Elon Musk’s companies are supported by $15 billion in government contracts, yet he is looking at slashing Americans’ hard-earned benefits to pay for trillions in new tax cuts for the wealthy.”</p>



<p>For Hedtler-Gaudette, of the Project on Government Oversight, the list of supposed savings on the DOGE “wall of receipts” had created more questions than answers. The list contains little more than a bare-bones contract description, a savings figure, and a link to a federal procurement website.</p>



<p>“We don’t have any of that additional context or analysis,” he said. “We just have to take their word for it.”</p>



<p>“I don’t think they’ve earned the benefit of the doubt.”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Apache Iceberg community has raised a PR <a href="https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/12264">S3: Disable strong integrity checksums</a> to disable the newly introduced integrity checksums in AWS S3 SDKs.</p><p>AWS has <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/introducing-default-data-integrity-protections-for-new-objects-in-amazon-s3/">introduced default data integrity protections for new objects in Amazon S3</a>, which is a positive development. However, they have also chosen to update the default settings in all SDKs, breaking compatibility with nearly all S3-compatible services.</p><hr><p>First of all, this is a good thing for me because checksums like <code>crc64-nvme</code> looks great—it's fast, secure, and has excellent SIMD support. As a user and developer, I'm excited to use it and integrate it into my projects. However, the S3 API is more than that. Many S3-compatible services are recommending that their users use the S3 SDK directly, and changing the default settings in this way can have a direct impact on their users.</p><p>For examples:</p><ul><li>Cloudlare R2: <a href="https://community.cloudflare.com/t/an-error-occurred-internalerror-when-calling-the-putobject-operation/764905/1">An error occurred (InternalError) when calling the PutObject operation</a></li><li>Tigris: <a href="https://www.tigrisdata.com/blog/downgrade-py-js/">If you’ve upgraded boto3 or the JavaScript S3 client in the last week, uploading files won’t work. Here’s how to fix it.</a></li></ul><blockquote><p>The recent AWS SDK bump introduced strong integrity checksums, and broke compatibility with many S3-compatible object storages (pre-2025 Minio, Vast, Dell EC etc).</p><p>In Trino project, we received the error report (Missing required header for this request: Content-Md5) from several users and had to disable the check temporarily. We recommend disabling it in Iceberg as well. I faced this issue when I tried upgrading Iceberg library to 1.8.0 in Trino.</p></blockquote><p>Although this feature is good, the AWS team has implemented it poorly by enforcing it, causing issues for many users of related services. This reminds me of the position where <a href="https://github.com/apache/opendal">Apache OpenDAL</a> should stand.</p><p>OpenDAL integrates all services by directly communicating with APIs instead of relying on SDKs, protecting users from potential disruptions like this one. OpenDAL's community also takes checksum support into deep consideration and is working to find a solution that benefits users while ensuring compatibility with unsupported services.</p><p>Maybe it's time to move away from using S3 SDKs and switch to OpenDAL if you just want to access compatible services for data:</p><ul><li>OpenDAL has a wide range of integrations tests for s3 compatible services from minio to ceph.</li><li>OpenDAL is governed by <a href="https://people.apache.org/phonebook.html?project=opendal">the Apache OpenDAL PMC</a> under <a href="https://www.apache.org/theapacheway/">the Apache Way</a> and not controlled by any business entity.</li></ul></div></div>]]></description>

That post argued that prompt engineering, while important, would be difficult to defend over time given how easy it is to experiment with LLMs. As a result, you have to focus on the quality of data your application has access to and your use of that data to differentiate yourself.</span></p><p>Everything we said in that post has held true, but the release of models like DeepSeek R1 and o3-mini have brought the concerns about AI applications’ moats back to the forefront. In the last few weeks, we’ve heard many forms of the question, “If LLMs keep getting cheaper and better, won’t everyone’s application get better? If so, how do you differentiate?” It’s worth it for every application builder to think through this in the more detail.</p><p>In short, unless you’re building or hosting foundation models, saying that AI is a differentiating factor is sort of like saying that your choice of database is what differentiated your SaaS product: No one cares.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff9e64e92-3d60-4b43-bb64-ddf89f442ef5_1792x1024.webp" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff9e64e92-3d60-4b43-bb64-ddf89f442ef5_1792x1024.webp 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff9e64e92-3d60-4b43-bb64-ddf89f442ef5_1792x1024.webp 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff9e64e92-3d60-4b43-bb64-ddf89f442ef5_1792x1024.webp 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff9e64e92-3d60-4b43-bb64-ddf89f442ef5_1792x1024.webp 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff9e64e92-3d60-4b43-bb64-ddf89f442ef5_1792x1024.webp" width="1456" height="832" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f9e64e92-3d60-4b43-bb64-ddf89f442ef5_1792x1024.webp&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:832,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:633206,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://frontierai.substack.com/i/157554740?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff9e64e92-3d60-4b43-bb64-ddf89f442ef5_1792x1024.webp&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff9e64e92-3d60-4b43-bb64-ddf89f442ef5_1792x1024.webp 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff9e64e92-3d60-4b43-bb64-ddf89f442ef5_1792x1024.webp 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff9e64e92-3d60-4b43-bb64-ddf89f442ef5_1792x1024.webp 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff9e64e92-3d60-4b43-bb64-ddf89f442ef5_1792x1024.webp 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Source: DALL-E 3.</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>As a baseline assumption, better models are a rising tide that lifts all boats. It’s generally a good thing for AI applications </span><a href="https://frontierai.substack.com/p/deepseek-o3-and-ai-applications" rel="">when more powerful models come out</a><span> because it gives you a more powerful engine to build on, but this isn’t the basis on which you’re going to build a moat. In the immediate frenzy after a new model is released, one team or another might figure out a better way to use that model, but that advantage is going to evaporate extremely quickly. There’s far too much useful content out on the internet for those advantages to last. This is basically the same as the prompt engineering moat we discussed above. In other words, if you’re relying on that as your differentiation, you’re going to get quickly steamrolled by the competition.</span></p><p>Of course, the existence of a good tool isn’t sufficient — how you use the tool matters just as much. Again, you can’t credibly claim that your application is “smarter” than the competition’s, so you’re going to have to look elsewhere for your differentiation. We’ll refer you back to last year’s post for a walkthrough of how you can build a technical moat, but in light of recent model advancements, we’re thinking about this from a product and market perspective.</p><p>We think defensibility comes down to three things.</p><p><strong>User experience.</strong><span> Sprinkling AI on your application for the sake having AI is something that we’ve railed against many times, so we’ll spare you the sanctimony. As we’ve talked about a couple times recently, we believe that most user experiences should be rethought for AI applications. There are many scenarios in which we’ve had to rely on user input previously that we can now infer. In many ways, the whole point of AI applications is that it should feel like magic because something that you previously had to do by hand is now fully automated with believable intelligence. If you’re thinking about taking traditional forms of UX and adding AI to them, that’s an okay starting point but not a defensible moat. On the other hand, if you’re thinking about how you can meet the user where they are, integrate into their workflow, and get tedious busy work out of their hair seamlessly, you’ll find a way to change the UX. Good UX, of course can be copied, but the teams that are capable of innovating once will do it again (see: Snap). In the context of enterprise products, </span><a href="https://frontierai.substack.com/p/the-rise-of-ai-work" rel="">the focus should be on delivering useful work</a><span>.</span></p><p><strong>Integration and workflows.</strong><span> We’re in the business of selling enterprise products, and many of you probably are too. We like to joke that every enterprise company either becomes a database company or an integrations company, and it’s clear that most AI applications companies are going to be integrations-heavy. In the previous paragraph, we touched on the importance of delivering work and snapping into the user’s works — that means that you’ll need to integrate with the customer’s messaging tool, document system, task tracker, and so on. This might sound tedious (and it can be!), but it’s also critical. Products that are able to integrate deeply into a customer’s workflow are incredibly sticky. You’re providing them so much value that they want you to be a part of everything they do — if they’re ever considering replacing you with something else, that product will have to be at least as valuable and justify the cost of re-integrating with everything you work with.</span></p><p><strong>Data in, data out.</strong><span> Everything in AI always comes back to data. We talked about the use of data extensively in our previous post. To summarize briefly, simply having data is not enough. The hard part is using the right data at the right time (hint: vector search is not enough). From a business perspective, data </span><em>out</em><span> is just as important as data in. At RunLLM, we’re now answering over 100K questions per-month. We can use that data to help our customers in many ways: understanding what features their customers are using, tracking the popularity of different workloads, identifying bugs, and so on. With some labeling, we can also use that content to help ourselves understand what kinds of questions we could do a better job of answering. Not every application is going to do all of those things on day one, but gathering the data over time builds an asset that you will benefit from tremendously in the long run. How you gather that data and how you use it over time will make a huge difference.</span></p><p>Ultimately, our opinion is that AI is no longer an interesting thing to talk about in terms of differentiation. At best, it’s a diminishing advantage, and its worst, it means you’re not planning for the future. Every application should probably be using AI in some form or the other, and the question is how effectively you understand your user’s needs and how effectively you’re able to shape your application to meet those needs. AI has so quickly become mainstream that it should now be considered a standard tool — a carpenter doesn’t brag about their hammer, and you shouldn’t brag about your use of GPT.</p></div></article></div><div id="discussion"><h4>Discussion about this post</h4></div></div>]]></description>
