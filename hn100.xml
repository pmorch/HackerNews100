</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>The homebrew/Homebrew case divergence is explained by Go’s <a href="https://go.dev/ref/mod#checksum-database">documentation</a> (thanks to Filippo Valsorda!):</p><blockquote><p>To avoid ambiguity when serving from case-insensitive file systems, the $module and $version elements are case-encoded by replacing every uppercase letter with an exclamation mark followed by the corresponding lower-case letter. This allows modules example.com/M and example.com/m to both be stored on disk, since the former is encoded as example.com/!m.</p></blockquote><p>Anyway, this caught my attention because Homebrew is known to use Ruby, and so I went to check the <a href="https://github.com/homebrew/homebrew-core">repository</a> contents.</p><p>GitHub language stats confirm it:</p><div><figure><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://reverse.put.as/2024/05/24/abusing-go-infrastructure/images/language_hu267d31ab4b55e7f16429a4d30873c6f5_16260_295x0_resize_q80_h2_box_3.webp"><source type="image/png" srcset="https://reverse.put.as/2024/05/24/abusing-go-infrastructure/images/language.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://reverse.put.as/2024/05/24/abusing-go-infrastructure/images/language.png" alt="language stats"></picture></figure></div><p>This result seems unexpected, since there are no traces of Go and there are more than 70,000 entries in Go’s checksum database. To be sure, I cloned the repository and tried to find any Go-related files such as <code>go.mod</code> or Go source files; however, nothing exists.</p><p>So I posted a tweet (technically a toot on Mastodon), got no replied and moved on.</p><p>While continuing to explore the database, I noticed another unusual case in <code>github.com/Edu4rdSHL/rust-headless-chrome</code>. It’s just a fork of <a href="https://github.com/rust-headless-chrome/rust-headless-chrome">rust-headless-chrome</a>, and there is nothing remarkable about the fork or the original except that they are both Rust repositories, and once again, no connection to Go.</p><p>Now my curiosity is piqued and the evil mode kicks in. It feels like arbitrary data can be pushed to the checksum database without a connection to Go. Why is the data being pushed? And how is it being pushed? I go to bed thinking about this, which is the most dangerous moment for security research. As I try to fall asleep, I come up with tons of ideas, but I’m usually too tired or lazy to take notes, and so, quite frequently, I can’t remember them in the morning. But this one wasn’t forgotten!</p><h3 id="research">Research</h3><p>A new day and a curious mind demands answers. Why, how and, what if are the most dangerous questions in this field. If a Git repository has nothing to do with Go code, how does it appear in the Go checksum database?</p><p>From previous documentation readings, I knew that <code>proxy.golang.org</code> was the default modules proxy, and <code>sum.golang.org</code> for the checksum database. A couple of <code>ripgrep</code> searches in Go source code return nothing interesting, so it was time to read Go’s documentation, which is usually quite good.</p><p>Where to start? <a href="https://go.dev/ref/mod">Go Modules Reference</a> was a great candidate and I finally found the answer to my question:</p><blockquote><p>If the go command consults the checksum database, then the first step is to retrieve the record data through the /lookup endpoint. If the module version is not yet recorded in the log, the checksum database will try to fetch it from the origin server before replying.</p></blockquote><p>Okay, this was easy! If the module doesn’t exist in the checksum database (and proxy), it will be downloaded by the checksum and proxy infrastructure. One of my questions was: how did the checksum database retrieve the modules since they can be anywhere? I couldn’t find anything in the Go code that was responsible for that (which wouldn’t explain at all how Ruby and Rust code ended up in the database).</p><p>So, the next logical step is easy. Can I get the Go checksum server to download arbitrary data?</p><p>According to the <a href="https://go.dev/ref/mod#checksum-database">documentation</a>, the endpoint to try this is <code>$base/lookup/$module@$version</code>:</p><blockquote><p>Returns the log record number for the entry about $module at $version, followed by the data for the record (that is, the go.sum lines for $module at $version) and a signed, encoded tree description that contains the record.</p></blockquote><p>First, let’s test it with a known record to see if and how it works:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span>$ curl https://sum.golang.org/lookup/github.com/homebrew/homebrew-core@v0.0.0-20240524162643-646fe2715a1c

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Since the repository doesn’t seem to have any version tag the pseudo-version is used instead. Go <a href="https://go.dev/ref/mod#pseudo-versions">documentation</a> explains the logic behind pseudo-versions.</p><p>The next step is to verify wheter a new Go module repository will be added to the checksum database and proxy if we call the <code>lookup</code> endpoint, as described.</p><p>After creating a simple new Go module and uploading to my GitHub account I have tried to issue the <code>lookup</code> command in two different forms, one not totally according to documentation, the other one also incorrect but trying to follow documentation. Both return errors, although different.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span>$ curl https://sum.golang.org/lookup/github.com/gdbinit/fluxmatter@latest

</span></span><span><span>not found: github.com/gdbinit/fluxmatter@v0.0.0: invalid version: unknown revision v0.0.0
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The errors are kind of expected since I haven’t versioned the module and wasn’t using the correct pseudo-version. But we can verify if the new module was fetched as described by the documentation. The easiest way would be to generate the correct pseudo-version and make another query to the checksum database. If the module was indeed downloaded, then the entry would exist and returned as in the <code>homebrew-core</code> test.</p><p>Another way would be to resync my copy of the checksum database and query it for my module:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sql"><span><span><span>sqlite</span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span><span>select</span><span> </span><span>*</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>modules</span><span> </span><span>where</span><span> </span><span>path</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>'github.com/gdbinit/fluxmatter'</span><span>;</span><span>

</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>Finally we can query the proxy and use the <code>latest</code> query to return the latest known version of a module.

</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>Around 95% of the unique paths present in <code>sum.golang.org</code> are hosted at GitHub. This is a raw statistic, without removing bogus data such as forks and targets that aren’t really Go code. But it still shows the magnitude of GitHub dependency in the Go ecosystem.</p><p>Go authors don’t seem to be completely unaware of this kind of scenario and implemented some restrictions, which are described in <a href="https://go.dev/ref/mod#zip-path-size-constraints">File path and size constraints</a> section. The most relevant one is:</p><blockquote><p>A module zip file may be at most 500 MiB in size. The total uncompressed size of its files is also limited to 500 MiB. go.mod files are limited to 16 MiB. LICENSE files are also limited to 16 MiB. These limits exist to mitigate denial of service attacks on users, proxies, and other parts of the module ecosystem. Repositories that contain more than 500 MiB of files in a module directory tree should tag module versions at commits that only include files needed to build the module’s packages; videos, models, and other large assets are usually not needed for builds.</p></blockquote><p>500MiB is more than enough for considerable abuse and all the others aren’t really a problem.</p><h3 id="abuse-what">Abuse what?</h3><p>For example, it can be used to bypass destination download restrictions on developer machines and in CI/CD servers (assuming that there isn’t a private GOPROXY). Malware can simply store payloads and retrieve them from the proxy when needed. And because we don’t have restrictions regarding the source domain (as long it’s a working VCS), we can load up the payloads from anywhere and make those sources disappear, leaving only a small trace in the checksum database entry.</p><p>A Denial of Service (DoS) attack on <code>proxy.golang.org</code> might be challenging to execute. I have shown that we can request any random Git repository (and probably any of the other supported VCS) to be downloaded by the proxy. For a possible attack, we would need to first gather as many GitHub URLs as possible and then issue as many requests as possible to the <code>lookup</code> API. I have no idea about the server implementation, but I would assume that something similar to a work queue is implemented, so there is a limit to the amount of parallel requests that will be processed. Bandwidth protections could also possibly be triggered from GitHub’s side. There is also a possibility of DoS-ing the storage space. I’m just guessing here :-).</p><p>A command and control (C2) can also be easily implemented on top of this. It’s very easy to find the latest version of any module using the <code>latest</code> query, so there isn’t need to query the checksum database and find all the available versions of our payload. The payload can be a simple file or can be disguised inside the <code>go.mod</code> or any other Go source file for extra stealthiness. A module DGA (Domain Generation Algorithm) can be used to avoid using a single repository for the C2. My original goal was to write a sample C2 to demonstrate this, but there isn’t really much to be done here.</p><p>To download commands from the C2, the implant just needs the following steps:</p><ul><li><p>Make a request to <code>https://proxy.golang.org/module_path/@latest</code>.</p></li><li><p>Parse the JSON result and extract the pseudo-version (or version if used).</p></li><li><p>Make another request to <code>https://proxy.golang.org/module_path/@v/version.zip</code> to download the zip file.</p></li><li><p>Extract the zip contents and parse the commands.</p></li></ul><p>Quite easy in some 300 or less lines of Go code.</p><h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3><p>My questions have been answered, and now I understand how the checksum database process works. So far, it’s not a severe issue in Go infrastructure. It’s something that can be easily abused but also improved. Maybe there are (documented or not) reasons to let non-Go code be uploaded to the proxy and checksum database. Or maybe there is already someone abusing this, and we can go on a treasure hunt through the almost 1.6 million unique repositories (my up-to-date database copy contains almost 22 million entries).</p><p>I still have questions why certain valid non-Go projects are in the database. Are they doing it on purpose? Why? Using Go’s transparent log as safety backup? Any hints about this?</p><p>I had fun with this, and I have a bunch of ideas to further explore. I have a feeling… ;-).</p><p>Have fun,<br>fG!</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

<dd>
<p>From a New York Times story by Nico Grant, under the headline “Google’s A.I. Search Errors Cause a Furor Online”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With each mishap, tech industry insiders have criticized the
company for dropping the ball. But in interviews, financial
analysts said Google needed to move quickly to keep up with its
rivals, even if it meant growing pains.</p>

<p>Google “doesn’t have a choice right now,” Thomas Monteiro, a
Google analyst at Investing.com, said in an interview.
“Companies need to move really fast, even if that includes
skipping a few steps along the way. The user experience will
just have to catch up.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That quote is insane. There’s no reason Google had to enable this feature now. None. If their search monopoly <a href="https://searchengineland.com/did-google-really-lose-search-market-share-to-microsoft-bing-in-april-440098">has been losing share recently</a>, it’s not because of rivals who are serving up AI-generated slop. It’s because even before this, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/04/24/zitron-google-search">Google’s search results quality was slipping in obvious ways</a>. This is just making it worse. They’ve turned Google Search — the crown jewel of the company, arguably the greatest consumer product ever made — into the butt of jokes.</p>

<p>LLM-powered search results are a bauble. The trust Google has built with users over the last 25 years is the most valuable asset the company owns. Google most certainly does have a choice, and they’ve chosen to erode that trust just so they can avoid accusations that they’re “behind”.</p>

<p>Behind is where you want to be when those who are ahead are publishing nonsense.</p>

Will Google save the web, or destroy it?<!-- --></b></p><p>If you've ever typed "air purifier reviews" into Google, you were probably looking for the kind of content you'll find on <!-- --><a target="_blank" href="http://housefresh.com/">HouseFresh.com<!-- --></a>. The site was started in 2020 by Gisele Navarro and her husband, based on a decade of experience writing about indoor air quality products. They filled their basement with purifiers, running rigorous science-based tests and writing articles to help consumers sort through marketing hype.<!-- --></p><p>House Fresh is an example of what has been a flourishing industry of independent publishers producing exactly the sort of original content Google <!-- --><a target="_blank" href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/fundamentals/creating-helpful-content">says it wants to promote<!-- --></a>. And indeed, soon after the website's launch, the tech giant started showing House Fresh at the top of search results. The website grew into a thriving business with 15 full-time employees. Navarro had big plans for the future.<!-- --></p><p>Then, in September 2023, Google made one in a series of major updates to the algorithm that runs its search engine.<!-- --></p><p>"It decimated us," Navarro says. "Suddenly the search terms that used to bring up House Fresh were sending people to big lifestyle magazines that clearly don't even test the products. The articles are full of information that I know is wrong."<!-- --></p><p>The second Google algorithm update came in March, and it was even more punishing. House Fresh's thousands of daily visitors dwindled to just hundreds. "We just got absolutely crushed," Navarro says. Over the last few weeks, <!-- --><a target="_blank" href="https://housefresh.com/how-google-decimated-housefresh/">House Fresh had to lay off most of its team<!-- --></a>. If nothing changes, she says, the website is doomed.<!-- --></p><p>A spokesperson for Google tells the BBC that the company only launches changes to Search after rigorous testing confirms that the shift will be helpful for users, and that the company gives website owners help, resources and opportunities for feedback on their Search rankings.<!-- --></p><p>Google stands firm in its position that the changes will be a benefit to the web, and changes to the Search algorithm are just the start. Last week, Google CEO Sundar Pichai stood in front of a crowd at the company's annual developer conference and announced one of the most significant moves in the search engine's history. Going forward, Pichai said, Google Search would provide its own <!-- --><a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq5nnlrwn9do">AI-generated answers<!-- --></a> to many of your questions, a feature called "AI Overviews" that's already rolled out to users in the United States. "The result is a product that does the work for you," Pichai said. "Google Search is generative AI at the scale of human curiosity."<!-- --></p><div data-component="quote-block"><p><span>Google's work is about to have a profound impact on what many of us see when we go online</span></p></div><p>AI Overviews are just one of a slew of dramatic changes Google has made to its core product over the past two years. The company says its recent effort to revamp Search will usher in an exciting new era of technology and help solve many of the issues plaguing the web. But critics say the opposite may be true. As Google retools its algorithms and uses AI to transition from a search engine to a search <!-- --><i id="and">and<!-- --></i> answer engine, some worry the result could be no less than an <!-- --><a target="_blank" href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/publishers-google-ai-feature-website-traffic">extinction-level event<!-- --></a> for the businesses that make much of your favourite content.<!-- --></p><p>One thing is certain: Google's work is about to have a profound impact on what many of us see when we go online.<!-- --></p><figure><div data-component="image-block"><p><img src="https://www.bbc.com/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png"><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0j04dwc.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0j04dwc.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0j04dwc.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0j04dwc.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0j04dwc.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0j04dwc.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0j04dwc.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0j04dwc.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0j04dwc.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0j04dwc.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Over the last two years, updates meant to make Search more “helpful” devasted many website owners who say they follow Google’s best practices.

(Source: SEMrush) (Credit: BBC)<!-- --></figcaption></p></figure><p>The changes came about because Google recognises the web has a problem. You've seen it yourself, if you've ever used a search engine. The Internet is dominated by a school of website building known as "search engine optimisation", or SEO, techniques that are meant to tune articles and web pages for better recognition from Google Search. Google even provides SEO tips, tools and advice for website owners. For millions of businesses that rely on the mechanisations of the Search machine, <!-- --><a target="_blank" href="https://www.theverge.com/c/23998379/google-search-seo-algorithm-webpage-optimization">SEO can be an unavoidable game<!-- --></a>.<!-- --></p><p>The trouble is SEO can be abused. Enterprising website owners realised you can sometimes make more money by <!-- --><a target="_blank" href="https://downloads.webis.de/publications/papers/bevendorff_2024a.pdf">making content designed to please Google's algorithms<!-- --></a>, rather than the human beings it's ostensibly designed to serve.<!-- --></p><p>Google's efforts to address this issue aren't always successful. If you've ever been frustrated by what comes up when you search for something like "Best Sneakers for Women", you know the issue. Often, the results for popular search terms are crowded with websites that contain very little useful information, but tonnes of ads and links to retailers that earn publishers a share of profits. What's often lost is what you're probably looking for when you open up Google: information from people who are knowledgeable and passionate about their topic.<!-- --></p><p>Google's war on spammy Search results has ramped up. In 2022, the company issued a "<!-- --><a target="_blank" href="https://blog.google/products/search/more-content-by-people-for-people-in-search/">Helpful Content Update<!-- --></a>" to its algorithm meant to weed out content created solely for the purpose of ranking higher on Search. Google issued a subsequent update in September, 2023, and <!-- --><a target="_blank" href="https://blog.google/products/search/google-search-update-march-2024/">a third algorithm tweak in March of this year<!-- --></a>. Google says the result is "45% less low-quality, unoriginal content in search results". It could be viewed as a wild success.<!-- --></p><p>"Our recent updates aim to connect people with content that is helpful, satisfying and original, from a diverse range of sites across the web," a Google spokesperson tells the BBC. "As we work to improve Search, we're continuing to focus on sending valuable traffic to sites and supporting a healthy, open web."<!-- --></p><figure><div data-component="image-block"><p><img src="https://www.bbc.com/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png"><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0j04dck.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0j04dck.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0j04dck.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0j04dck.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0j04dck.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0j04dck.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0j04dck.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0j04dck.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0j04dck.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0j04dck.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Serenity Strull/BBC/Getty Images For better or worse, Google Search dictates the shape of the web.

Some online publishers say the company wields that power irresponsibly (Credit: Serenity Strull/BBC/Getty Images)<!-- --></figcaption></p></figure><p>But the updates had some surprising consequences as well. For example, data from the analytics tool <!-- --><a target="_blank" href="http://semrush/">SEMrush<!-- --></a> suggests that the website for New York Magazine lost 32% of its Google Search traffic in the past six months, while GQ.com shrank 26%. The data indicates <!-- --><a target="_blank" href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/">Urban Dictionary<!-- --></a>, a wildly popular crowdsourced dictionary of English language slang, dropped some 18 million page views, amounting to more than half its Search traffic. OprahDaily.com was down nearly 58%. (SEMrush is an industry-standard tool, but its numbers are estimates and this data only measures traffic coming from Google Search, specifically.)<!-- --></p><p>A New York Magazine spokesperson said these findings were incomplete and didn't reflect the company's internal analysis. Representatives for GQ, Oprah Daily and Urban Dictionary did not respond to requests for comment by the time this article was published. However, experts and more than half a dozen media executives and websites owners told the BBC the broad trends in the data are all too real.<!-- --></p><div data-component="quote-block"><p><span>The increase in traffic Reddit is seeing is unprecedented on the Internet – Lily Ray</span></p></div><p>In place of these sites, there's one platform you'll be seeing much, much more of: Reddit. According to SEMrush, Reddit saw a surge that amounted to a 126% growth in traffic from Google Search. The company is already feeling the benefit. Reddit just announced its first quarterly earnings since becoming a publicly traded company in March 2024. Its <!-- --><a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68610711">revenue totals $243m (£191m)<!-- --></a>, up an eye-watering 48% from the year prior.<!-- --></p><p>"The increase in traffic Reddit is seeing is unprecedented on the Internet," says Lily Ray, vice president of SEO strategy and research at the marketing agency <!-- --><a target="_blank" href="https://www.amsive.com/">Amsive<!-- --></a>, and a celebrity in the world of SEO. "Cooking content, adult content, video games, gardening, fashion, everything is all just Reddit."<!-- --></p><p>A representative for Reddit declined to comment.<!-- --></p><p>Reddit isn't the only winner after Google's recent algorithm updates. SEMrush data shows that other user-generated sites such as Quora and Instagram saw similarly astronomical rises, and there were impressive spikes at LinkedIn and Wikipedia as well. In one sense, Google was just following a trend. Over the past few years, swaths of savvy internet users started <!-- --><a target="_blank" href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90722739/is-reddit-a-better-search-engine-than-google">adding the word "Reddit" to the end of their web searches<!-- --></a> in the hopes it would bring up people sharing their honest opinions, as opposed to websites trying to game Google's system. It's something Google's public liaison for search, Danny Sullivan, <!-- --><a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/1bne9i3/comment/kxqaqmp/">has noted<!-- --></a>.<!-- --></p><p>"We've found that people often want to learn from others' experiences, and so we surface content from hundreds of forums and other communities across the web," a Google spokesperson says. "Our agreement with Reddit absolutely did not include ranking its content higher on Search."<!-- --></p><p>But Google results are a zero-sum game. If the search engine sends traffic to one site, it has to take it from another, and the effects on the losers in this Reddit equation are just as dramatic. "Google's just committing war on publisher websites," Ray says. "It's almost as if Google designed an algorithm update to specifically go after small bloggers. I've talked to so many people who've just had everything wiped out," she says.<!-- --></p><p>A number of website owners and search experts who spoke to the BBC said there's been a general shift in Google results towards websites with big established brands, and away from small and independent sites, that seems totally disconnected from the quality of the content.<!-- --></p><p>The change was instant for Daniel Hart, editor-in-chief of the UK-based entertainment news site <!-- --><a target="_blank" href="https://readysteadycut.com/">Ready Steady Cut<!-- --></a>. "After Google's September update, our traffic halved immediately, and it's only gotten worse. We've just been blitzed by the Reddit stuff in particular, but we're also being replaced by spam websites that are stealing our content. It makes no sense," Hart says. In the months following, the lost income forced Ready Steady Cut to reduce its team of 20 writers and editors down to just four, Hart says.<!-- --></p><p>A Google spokesperson said the company's recent updates have dealt a major blow to spammy, unoriginal content, and Google keeps a close watch on evolving abusive practices that lead to low-quality information in Search.<!-- --></p><p>After Google's updates, the company provided tips to website owners and said there was a path to recovery. Hart says the site hired consultants and pivoted to focus on Google's recommendations, spending sleepless nights working to update the site. After almost a year, none of it helped. "I wasted the last eight months of my life trying to follow Google's advice." he says. "Google claims they want content from people with first-hand experience and helpful context, and we're a massive example of that. It's just heartbreaking."<!-- --></p><figure><div data-component="image-block"><p><img src="https://www.bbc.com/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png"><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0j04fnt.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0j04fnt.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0j04fnt.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0j04fnt.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0j04fnt.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0j04fnt.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0j04fnt.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0j04fnt.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0j04fnt.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0j04fnt.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="A few examples show how recent changes to Google Search had startling effects on a wide variety of websites.

(Source: SEMrush) (Credit: BBC)<!-- --></figcaption></p></figure><p>But the biggest offence, according to the website owners and content creators who spoke to the BBC, is the AI generated responses.<!-- --></p><p>Google argues its AI overviews in search results will be a boon to websites. Liz Reid, Google's head of search, wrote in a <!-- --><a target="_blank" href="https://blog.google/products/search/generative-ai-google-search-may-2024/">blog post<!-- --></a> that the company's AI search results actually increase traffic that Google sends to websites. "AI Overviews get more clicks than if the page had appeared as a traditional web listing for that query," Reid wrote. "As we expand this experience, we’ll continue to focus on sending valuable traffic to publishers and creators." However, the company hasn't shared any of the data backing up that claim, and many website owners and industry experts worry the opposite effect is just as likely.<!-- --></p><p>Katie Berry, owner of the cleaning advice website <!-- --><a target="_blank" href="https://housewifehowtos.com/">Housewife How-Tos<!-- --></a>, assumes users will just end their searches if Google's AI answers questions for them. The AI search results "<!-- --><a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/thatkatieberry/status/1790726312820171104">answer questions superficially<!-- --></a>, and often incorrectly, so people don't visit my site," Berry says. According to Berry, her site's traffic fell 70% after the 2022 Google update and dropped even further after Google started testing its new AI. "My site had more traffic in its first months of existence than it gets now, even though my rankings have not changed all that much," she says.<!-- --></p><p>Others, such as travel writer David Leiter, say the potential consequences are especially problematic because they feel Google's AI is outright stealing their content.<!-- --></p><p>For example, Leiter says a search for "Best Slot Canyons Near Las Vegas" used to bring up an article on his website, <!-- --><a target="_blank" href="https://theworldtravelguy.com/slot-canyons-las-vegas-nevada/">World Travel Guy<!-- --></a>. However, a search earlier this week brought up an AI-generated response at the top of the page instead.<!-- --></p><p>"Google has replaced my article with the giant AI Overview box, and it spits out an answer that is mostly wrong," Leiter says. "The first four places it lists are not even slot canyons. A slot canyon is a specific type of canyon with a narrow passageway, but the AI doesn't understand that. It's just listing random canyons and even a walking trail instead." The AI Overview did include a link to Leiter's article, but only if you took the time to click a tiny arrow at the bottom of the result. Leiter says he doesn't believe he'll get more traffic than he used to as the top search result. In either case, it's a small consolation. Leiter says Google's recent algorithm updates erased 95% of his traffic.<!-- --></p><p>Google acknowledges that AI tools may provide inaccurate information, but says it's constantly working to improve results. A Google spokesperson says AI Overviews are generally taken from multiple webpages, not single sources, and the responses are designed to highlight relevant links. The spokesperson says publishers can use a <!-- --><a target="_blank" href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/robots-meta-tag">special tag<!-- --></a> on their webpages to control whether or not AI Overviews includes a link to their sites. However, once an AI model scrapes your content, it may be impossible to remove that data.<!-- --></p><p>Media executives aren't the only ones questioning Google's control of the internet. Google is simultaneously battling numerous antitrust lawsuits against different parts of the company's sprawling £1.7tn ($2.2tn) business. The company is currently awaiting a decision in a lawsuit brought by the US Department of Justice <!-- --><a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-66755272">accusing Google of running an illegal monopoly<!-- --></a> in the search engine industry. If the tech giant loses the case, the penalties could range from massive fines to a forced break-up of the company.<!-- --></p><p>Google, which controls more than 90% of the worldwide search business, argues that the company's success stems solely from the fact that it makes superior products. A Google spokesperson says the company faces "immense competition" and people have many choices about how they search for information online.<!-- --></p><p>"I understand that Google doesn't owe us or anyone else traffic," says Navarro, of House Fresh. "But Google controls the roads. If tomorrow they decide the roads won't go to an entire town, that down dies. It's too much power to just shrug and say, 'Oh well, it's just the free market,'" she says.<!-- --></p><p>"I might just try working in the offline world, just pack it all up and tend a shop somewhere," says Navarro. "Maybe it was naive to think we could succeed just by making great original content that people want to read."<!-- --></p><p>--<!-- --></p><p><i id="For timely, trusted tech news from global correspondents to your inbox, sign up to the ">For timely, trusted tech news from global correspondents to your inbox, sign up to the <!-- --></i><a target="_self" href="https://cloud.email.bbc.com/techdecoded-newsletter-signup?&amp;at_bbc_team=studios&amp;at_medium=Onsite&amp;at_objective=acquisition&amp;at_ptr_type=&amp;at_ptr_name=bbc.com&amp;at_format=&amp;at_link_origin=&amp;at_campaign=techdecoded&amp;at_campaign_id=&amp;at_adset_name=&amp;at_adset_id=&amp;at_creation=&amp;at_creative_id=&amp;at_campaign_type=owned"><b id="Tech Decoded newsletter"><i id="Tech Decoded newsletter">Tech Decoded newsletter<!-- --></i></b></a><i id=", while ">, while <!-- --></i><a target="_self" href="https://cloud.email.bbc.com/SignUp10_08?&amp;at_bbc_team=studios&amp;at_medium=Onsite&amp;at_objective=acquisition&amp;at_ptr_name=bbc.com&amp;at_link_origin=featuresarticle&amp;at_campaign=essentiallist&amp;at_campaign_type=owned"><b id="The Essential List"><i id="The Essential List">The Essential List<!-- --></i></b></a><i id=" delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week."> delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.<!-- --></i>&nbsp;<!-- --></p></article></div></div>]]></description>

<p>Lapis is a framework for building web applications in <a href="https://lua.org/">Lua</a> (or <a href="https://moonscript.org/">MoonScript</a>) that primarily targets <a href="https://openresty.org/">OpenResty</a>, a high performance web platform that runs on a customized version of <a href="https://nginx.org/">Nginx</a>. Lapis can also be used in other server environments, being compatible with any modern version of Lua.</p>

<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<p>With OpenResty, Lua is run directly inside of the Nginx worker using LuaJIT, giving you the
smallest barrier between the webserver and your code. Have a look at <a href="http://www.techempower.com/benchmarks">Web Framework
Benchmarks</a> just to see how OpenResty
stacks up against other platforms.</p>

<p>Utilizing the power of <a href="https://leafo.net/posts/itchio-and-coroutines.html">Lua
coroutines</a>, you can write
clean code that looks synchronous but can achieve high throughput by
automatically running asynchronously without blocking. Networking operations
like database queries and HTTP requests will automatically yield to allow for
handling concurrent requests, all without all that callback spaghetti seen in
other asynchronous platforms. It’s fast, easy to read, and easy to write.</p>

<h2>Templates</h2>

<p>Write your templates either in <a href="https://github.com/leafo/etlua">etlua</a> or in
pure Lua/MoonScript.</p>

<p>The <code>Widget</code> base class allows you to organize your templates as modules,
enabling you to use inheritance and mixins to mix and match methods combined
with the HTML builder syntax that lets you express HTML with the full power of
the language you're already using.</p>

<p>The HTML builder syntax makes you immune to cross site scripting attacks from
user-provided input by ensuring all written content is escaped correctly.</p>

<p dir="auto"><code>mistral-finetune</code> is a light-weight codebase that enables memory-efficient and performant finetuning of Mistral's models.
It is based on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685" rel="nofollow">LoRA</a>, a training paradigm where most weights are frozen and only 1-2% additional weights in the form of low-rank matrix perturbations are trained.</p>
<p dir="auto">For maximum efficiency it is recommended to use a A100 or H100 GPU. The codebase is optimized
for multi-GPU-single-node training setups, but for smaller models, such as the 7B a single GPU suffices.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note</strong></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>The goal of this repository is to provide a simple, guided entrypoint to finetune Mistral models.
As such, it is fairly opinionated (especially around data formatting) and does not aim at being exhaustive
across multiple model architecture or hardware types.
For more generic approaches, you can check out some other great projects like
<a href="https://pytorch.org/torchtune/stable/overview.html" rel="nofollow">torchtune</a>.</li>

<p dir="auto"><strong>Important Notice</strong>: For 8x7B Base V1 and 8x7B Instruct V1, it is necessary to use our v3 tokenizer and extend the vocabulary size to 32768 prior to fine-tuning.

<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto"><em>Pretrain</em>:</h3><a id="user-content-pretrain" aria-label="Permalink: Pretrain:" href="#pretrain"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Pretrain data corresponds to plain text data stored in the <code>"text"</code> key. E.g:</p>

<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<ol start="5" dir="auto">

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Customizing training configuration</h2><a id="user-content-customizing-training-configuration" aria-label="Permalink: Customizing training configuration" href="#customizing-training-configuration"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The example <code>mistral-finetune/examples/7B</code> defines reasonable parameters for learning rate, weight decay, etc... but you are advised to
customize these settings for your use case.</p>
<p dir="auto">Generally, a training configuration should fill the following parameters:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>model_id_or_path</code> defines the model to start training from. This can be a path to a pre-trained model or a local model directory.</li>
<li><code>run_dir</code> defines the directory where training checkpoints and metrics are stored.</li>
<li><code>seq_len</code> defines the sequence length for training. This is the maximum length of input sequences the model will process. Samples are packed to reach a length of <code>seq_len</code> for maximum training efficiency.</li>
<li><code>batch_size</code> defines the number of training examples used per GPU. <strong>Note</strong>: The overall effective batch_size (in tokens) across all GPUs equals <code>num_gpus</code> x <code>batch_size</code> x <code>seq_len</code>.</li>
<li><code>max_steps</code> defines the maximum number of training steps. This is the total number of iterations the training process will run. It can be adjusted based on the specific needs of your training scenario. Total number of tokens seen during training is <code>max_steps</code> x <code>num_gpus</code> x <code>batch_size</code> x <code>seq_len</code>.</li>
<li><code>optim.lr</code> defines the learning rate. This is the initial learning rate for the optimizer.</li>
<li><code>optim.weight_decay</code> defines weight decay. Weight decay is a regularization technique used to prevent overfitting by penalizing large weights. We recommend leaving it at 0.1.</li>
<li><code>optim.pct_start</code> defines the percentage of the total training steps used for the learning rate warm-up phase before it starts to decrease. It corresponds to pct_start of PyTorch's OneCycleLR.</li>
<li><code>lora.rank</code> defines the size of the LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) adapters. We recommend 64 or less, which adjusts the rank of the low-rank decomposition used in LoRA.</li>
<li><code>seed</code> defines the random seed for initialization and data shuffling/sampling. Setting a seed ensures reproducibility of results.</li>
<li><code>log_freq</code> defines the logging frequency. This specifies how often (in steps) to log training metrics.</li>
<li><code>data.instruct_data</code> is the path to the instruction data used for training. This field has to be filled with one or multiple data sources in the format as explained above. Each data source should either be a path to jsonl file of a path to a directory containing jsonl files followed by a weighting to define the importance of this dataset: <code>&lt;path/to/data_source&gt;:&lt;weight&gt;</code>. E.g.: <code>data.instruct_data: "/path/to/data1.jsonl:5.,/path/to/data2.jsonl:1.,/path/to/dir_of_jsonls:1."</code></li>
<li><code>data.data</code> is an optional path to additional pretraining data in the format as explained above. Note that this field can be left blank.</li>
<li><code>data.eval_instruct_data</code> is an optional path to evaluation instruction data to run cross-validation at every <code>eval_freq</code> steps. Cross-validation metrics are displayed as <code>loss</code> and <code>perplexity</code>.</li>
<li><code>eval_freq</code> defines how often (in steps) to evaluate the model. This specifies the interval at which the model is evaluated on the validation set.</li>
<li><code>no_eval</code> is a flag to enable or disable intermediate evaluation. Setting it to False enables periodic evaluation during training.</li>
<li><code>ckpt_freq</code> defines how often (in steps) to save checkpoints. This specifies the interval at which the model's state is saved.</li>
<li><code>ckpt_only_lora</code> defines whether to only save the trained LoRA checkpoints or whether the trained LoRA should directly be merged into the base model and saved. <strong>Note</strong>: When setting <code>ckpt_only_lora=False</code> make sure that you have enough CPU and GPU memory to save the full model on a single process (this is usually only possible for the 7B model).</li>
<li><code>wandb.key</code> is used to pass your Weights &amp; Biases (wandb) API key for logging. This allows you to log training metrics to the wandb dashboard.</li>
<li><code>wandb.project</code> defines the wandb project name. This is where the training run will be logged in the wandb interface.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Inference</h2><a id="user-content-inference" aria-label="Permalink: Inference" href="#inference"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Once your model is trained, you should try it out in inference. We recommend using <a href="https://github.com/mistralai/mistral-inference">mistral-inference</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Make sure to have <code>mistral_inference</code> correctly installed:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="pip install mistral_inference"><pre><code>pip install mistral_inference
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Assuming your <code>lora.safetensors</code> is saved under <code>$HOME/ultra_chat_test/checkpoints/checkpoint_000300/consolidated/lora.safetensors</code>, you can chat with the model using <code>mistral_inference</code>, <em>e.g.</em>:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="mistral-chat /mnt/slow/runs/patrick/mistral-finetune/7B/ --max_tokens 256 --temperature 1.0 --instruct --lora_path $HOME/ultra_chat_test/checkpoints/checkpoint_000300/consolidated/lora.safetensors"><pre>mistral-chat /mnt/slow/runs/patrick/mistral-finetune/7B/ --max_tokens 256 --temperature 1.0 --instruct --lora_path <span>$HOME</span>/ultra_chat_test/checkpoints/checkpoint_000300/consolidated/lora.safetensors</pre></div>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Model extension</h2><a id="user-content-model-extension" aria-label="Permalink: Model extension" href="#model-extension"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Important</strong>: Note that one can only fine-tune mistral models that are compatible with the v3 tokenizer which entails that the models have a vocabulary size of 32768 - not 32000. One can however easily extend older version of vocabulary size 32000 to have a vocabulary size of 32768 by using:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="python -m utils.extend_model_vocab --original_model_ckpt /folder/to/old/model --extended_model_ckpt /folder/to/extended/model"><pre><code>python -m utils.extend_model_vocab --original_model_ckpt /folder/to/old/model --extended_model_ckpt /folder/to/extended/model
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Once the extension has worked, one can fine-tune using the newly created model checkpoint in <code>/folder/to/extended/model</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">FAQ:</h2><a id="user-content-faq" aria-label="Permalink: FAQ:" href="#faq"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>What's the best practice of fine-tuning MoEs?</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">We see a higher degree of performance variance in when fine-tuning MoE models. It's not unusual to find that fine-tuning MoEs models with different seeds can lead to a high variance in performance. We did not observe such a high variance with dense models. Therefore, we suggest running multiple instances of the same fine-tuning process on MoEs models and selecting the one that performs best.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>How can I determine the number of tokens used during the model training process?</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">You can use the following script to find out: <a href="https://github.com/mistralai/mistral-finetune/blob/main/utils/validate_data.py">https://github.com/mistralai/mistral-finetune/blob/main/utils/validate_data.py</a>. This script accepts a .yaml training file as input and returns the number of tokens the model is being trained on.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>What should I do if I encounter a CUDA out-of-memory error?</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">One possible solution is to reduce the batch size per GPU. The batch size is equal to <code>seq_len</code> x <code>batch_size</code>. Try setting <code>batch_size</code> to 1 and reduce <code>seq_len</code>. You can define the <code>batch_size</code> and <code>seq_len</code> in the .yaml file.</p>

				<p>JetBrains has released RustRover, a dedicated IDE for the <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3218074/what-is-rust-safe-fast-and-easy-software-development.html">Rust programming language</a> that combines an integrated Rust toolchain with support for AI assistance through an optional plugin and subscription.</p><p><a href="https://blog.jetbrains.com/rust/2024/05/21/rustrover-is-released-and-includes-a-free-non-commercial-option/" rel="nofollow">Announced May 21</a>, <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/rust/" rel="nofollow">RustRover</a> is positioned to simplify the Rust coding experience while “unlocking the language’s full potential,” JetBrains said. Capabilities include real-time feedback, code suggestions, simplified toolchain management, and team collaboration.</p><p>JetBrains also rolled out a new licensing model. RustRover is available through a paid commercial license or a free non-commercial license, the latter for individuals using RustRover for non-commercial purposes.</p><p>Previously, JetBrains offered <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/rust/" rel="nofollow">IntelliJ Rust</a>, an open-source Rust plugin for IntelliJ IDEs. With RustRover the company aims to provide a dedicated product with enhanced functionality for the growing Rust developer community. JetBrains also has been previewing a multi-language editor and IDE, called <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3664112/jetbrains-fleet-the-future-of-ides.html">JetBrains Fleet</a>, that supports Rust development.</p><p>Key features of RustRover include:</p><ul>
<li>Rust toolchain support including support for the Rust compiler.</li>
<li>Version control system integration, with <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3267565/what-is-github-more-than-git-version-control-in-the-cloud.html">GitHub</a> and <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3654955/what-is-git-version-control-for-collaborative-programming.html">Git</a> support. Users are able to streamline collaboration and control for teams.</li>
<li>Error detection and real-time feedback for debugging.</li>
<li>Support for front-end technologies and databases.</li>
<li>Permissive completion and parsing including smart code suggestions even in unconventional contexts.</li>
<li>Unit testing integration for testing, rerunning failed tests, and resolving errors.</li>
</ul><p>RustRover has natural similarities to JetBrains’ other language-specific IDEs including <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3602670/pycharm-python-ide-backs-apple-silicon.html">PyCharm</a> for <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3204016/what-is-python-powerful-intuitive-programming.html">Python</a>, <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3630389/jetbrains-go-language-ide-prepares-for-generics.html">GoLand</a> for <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3198928/whats-the-go-language-really-good-for.html">Go</a>, and <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3692291/jetbrains-updates-ides-for-java-javascript-ruby.html">RubyMine</a> for <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3687219/whatever-happened-to-ruby.html">Ruby</a>. All support the <a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/22282-jetbrains-ai-assistant" rel="nofollow">JetBrains AI Assistant plugin</a>, which provides AI-powered code suggestions, code explanations, and code chat through a JetBrains AI subscription.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>Many beginnings imply a contemporaneous ending. This is often bittersweet. <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2018/08/206811/some-personal-news-twitter">Some personal news</a> implies a tearful goodbye to soon-to-be-former coworkers. A new adventure of scholasticism and self-discovery means saying goodbye to your high-school friends. And a new brokerage account often implies leaving a years- (or decades-!) long relationship with a firm that stuck with you, feels a bit like a jilted lover, and by the way happens to constructively control most of your net worth.</p><p>This particular beginning and ending is mediated by a complex techno-legal system called ACATS: the Automated Customer Assets Transfer System. ACATS is quite impressive, underpins a very important part of the financial system, and some of the quirks of how it operates will probably surprise you.</p><p>The title of this issue is a play on an AI-generated song. <strong>Infohazard warning about which I am being absolutely serious</strong>: you probably have the experience of a song being an “earworm” that you cannot get out of your head. This song is not simply an earworm. It is auditory superstimulus, like the Dorito, carefully designed to taste like nothing in nature. Unlike the Dorito, which someone is guilty of, this song either has no author or has <em>all</em> the authors. I think if you say the words “my cat” to me when I am on my deathbed I will immediately hum three notes. With that very important caveat out of the way, if you want to be mimetically infected as the price of getting this reference, take a listen at Sono <a href="https://suno.com/song/30a612d0-1c1c-406e-a95b-1c6d6b486cf5">here</a>.</p><h2 id="a-brief-digression-into-self-regulatory-organizations">A brief digression into self-regulatory organizations</h2><p>Brokerages are regulated by FINRA. FINRA stands for many things, though these days FINRA <em>might</em> deny that it is an acronym. In previous years, though, it was definitely the <strong>F</strong>inancial <strong>In</strong>dustry <strong>R</strong>egulatory <strong>A</strong>uthority. One reason FINRA is not an acronym, to the extent it is not an acronym, is that an unsophisticated investor might hear that and assume “Ah yes, FINRA is clearly part of the government” and FINRA will immediately swear up, down, and sideways they are not. They are just a financial regulator overseeing trillions of dollars.</p><p>Self-regulatory organizations (SROs) are industry associations. There are many industry associations in the world.</p><p>Some pool money to pay for a-rising-tide-lifts-all-bovines <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gkqzxss8Ss">advertising</a>. Some exist to get peers together for merriment, diversion, and some conspiracy against the public. (This is a joking reference to a <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/3300/3300-h/3300-h.htm#chap12">famous passage</a> from Adam Smith. On a completely unrelated note, please feel free to introduce yourself if you see me at a software conference. I’ll be doing a talk about raising prices.)</p><p>SROs are the type of industry associations that partially exist as a blocking play. If we don’t get our house in order, Dangerous Professionals from the government are going to barge into our house to order it for us. That will be disruptive to providing valuable services to customers at a price they are willing to pay.</p><h2 id="finra-regulates-asset-transfers-between-brokerages">FINRA regulates asset transfers between brokerages</h2><p><a href="https://www.kalzumeus.com/2019/6/26/how-brokerages-make-money/">Discount brokerages</a> are large, trustworthy, competent institutions. But there are some brokerages which are not. There are wirehouses attached to large investment banks like e.g. JP Morgan (large, trustworthy, and competent, but not a discount brokerage), there is Robinhood (a large discount brokerage), but by far the most numerous are small boutiques which keep on keeping on.</p><p>Some of those boutiques have been known to be a bit grasping when assets under management attempt to walk out the door. They would refuse to let their customer leave. When told this was extremely improper, they whined and said it was really difficult to facilitate their customer leaving, and wouldn’t the customer prefer staying, and Cindy who can actually take care of this will be back in the office the first Tuesday after the waxing moon.</p><p>And so FINRA listened to its members (brokerages), customers, advocates, and counterparts in government, and passed a rule. Cindy can go on vacation any time she wants, but it is the brokerage and not Cindy who is responsible for outcomes, and only one outcome is acceptable: <em>if a customer wants to move their assets out, you must let them</em>.</p><p>The full rule is necessarily more complicated than that gloss of the <em>intent</em> of the rule. It’s not unknowable inside baseball; see <a href="https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/rulebooks/finra-rules/11870">FINRA Rule 11870</a>. It is <em>somewhat</em> somnambulance inducing:</p><blockquote>
<p>When a customer whose securities account is carried by a member (the "carrying member") wishes to transfer securities account assets, in whole or in specifically designated part, to another member (the "receiving member") and gives authorized instructions to the receiving member, both members must expedite and coordinate activities with respect to the transfer..</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But, by the standards of many regulations, it is short and actionable.</p><p>Rule 11870 doesn’t itself establish a technical artifact but exists in tandem with one: ACATS.</p><h2 id="how-does-one-transfer-securities-account-assets">How does one transfer securities account assets?</h2><p>What is a share of stock, really? An abstracted right to ownership of a corporation? A legal contract promising the same? Some complex sociopolitical edifice where judges who are not yet born will of course automatically award surplus returns of an enterprise to an equity holder even when told not to by a nuclear-armed government? A share is all of these things.</p><p>But also, in a really important way, a share is an entry in a spreadsheet.</p><p>Whose spreadsheet? <em>Everyones’ spreadsheets</em>. Stock that you own, and you really do own it, exists as the superposition of several spreadsheets. Your spreadsheets, for example. Those matter. Spreadsheets (or databases, or blockchains, or… actually no probably not blockchains even cryptoenthusiast technologists don’t believe that will happen anymore) at your brokerage. And then, in a fascinating wrinkle that Matt Levine has covered <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/mergers-and-acquisitions/matt-levines-money-stuff-the-sec-comes-for-crypto-custody">many</a> times, a spreadsheet at the Depository Trust Company, which keeps almost all the stocks and simultaneously has very probably never heard of you.</p><p>So when you move stock between brokerages, nobody needs to print out a stock certificate and courier it across Chicago, New York, or the Pacific Ocean anymore. Thank goodness. (I have no stories, but I have friends who have stories, and the Die Hard steal-the-bearer-bonds plot <em>didn’t come from nowhere</em>.) You just have to coordinate updating the spreadsheets. How hard could that possibly be.</p><p>ACATS is a system with technical and legal elements to it. It greatly decreases the number of moving parts required to coordinate updating spreadsheets. The pre-ACATS era meant needing to interface directly with the thousands of other brokerages in the United States. You had to care deeply about the operational differences at their firms. Sometimes your Ops and their Ops didn’t use the same version of Excel. It was anarchy. ACATS puts very diverse firms between a relatively consistent experience, while simultaneously codifying operations and reducing various forms of risk to the process. This is a very common way to create value in financial technology.</p><h2 id="what-does-an-acats-request-actually-entail">What does an ACATS request actually entail?</h2><p>A customer selects a new brokerage and tells that brokerage they intend to move in assets. That brokerage, which very much wants to get those assets onto their own books (and spreadsheets, etc etc, as a necessary consequence), will assist them in operating ACATS on their behalf. The customer will very likely never care about nor understand a complex operational symphony happening in the background.</p><p>The brokerage will likely kick off a few processes which don’t necessarily happen in Internet time and aren’t strictly coupled but might feel like they are to the customer. They will ask the customer to create a new account, which (<em>extremely</em> relevantly) will require the brokerage running their <a href="https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/kyc-and-aml-beyond-the-acronyms/">KYC</a> process on the customer. They will <em>very likely</em> ask the customer for their last brokerage statement. And they will ask the customer to authorize them moving over the previous assets.</p><p>That authorization is customarily on a very templated rather short contract / form, and the template is almost inevitably going to rhyme heavily with the template in FINRA Rule 11870. But, in one of those fascinating rabbit holes about how the world actually works, authorization does not mean performing a particular ritual on a particular written instrument. Authorization means permitting something. You can permit something with words, most typically, or even a gesture.</p><p>As a very concrete consequence of this, many of those forms will be filled out not by the customer, but by the brokerage employee working on onboarding them. This is not bad and is not fraud. That feels weird to say out loud but it is extremely important: they <em>have</em> authorization. They are doing <em>the thing brokerages do</em>, taking specific authorization for a specific action from a customer and translating it into a complex series of technical and legal processes to cause the physical result in the world that the customer wants to happen.</p><p>And so, the form that authorizes an ACATS request might have a signature blank at the bottom. Some of them are signed by the customer, in that the customer had that form physically presented to them and they affixed their signature with a pen. Some are signed by the customer via a solution like Docusign, which might <em>or might not</em> imply that they actually saw an image which physically resembles the form that gets signed.</p><p>And some of them are signed on the customer’s behalf. The exact form of that might look like the ASCII characters /s/ John Q. Public. Skeptical? Those are, and these words are carefully chosen to sound very rigorous, “an electronic signature in a format recognized as valid under federal law to conduct interstate commerce.” You probably assumed there would be public key encryption involved in an electronic signature and this is <em>allowed</em> but <a href="https://www.fdic.gov/resources/supervision-and-examinations/consumer-compliance-examination-manual/documents/10/x-3-1.pdf">not <em>required</em></a>.</p><p>All of this is <em>actually normal</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>And, combined with the next bit, it will give many security-minded people an aneurysm.</p><h2 id="brokerages-frequently-do-not-verify-incoming-acats-requests">Brokerages frequently do not verify incoming ACATS requests</h2><p>ACATS is a network of trusted peers who have contractual (and other) relationships with a central organizing entity. One thing peers agree to do is to act upon incoming requests <em>very, very quickly</em> by the standards of financial institutions. One thing they do to accomplish this is very surprising: most ACATS requests will cause the brokerage losing the assets to not verify with their customer that the request is authorized.</p><p>“What.”, I hear you ask. No, this is true, and this is designed, and this is normal. It only <em>sounds</em> batshit insane.</p><p>Let’s start with the timeline: a brokerage receiving an ACATS request must complete any investigation within three business days. FINRA doesn’t get hyperspecific on any particular thing you must or mustn’t do within those three business days, but that shot clock starts running instantly once your computer gets the message from the other computer.</p><p>“Cindy didn’t check her mail because she was on vacation” is not a valid excuse. The brokerage gets only two options: validate (agree to) the request, or take exception to the request. Validation starts a second shot clock to actually complete the spreadsheet updates. It is not quite a no-takesies-backsies decision. True trapdoors are rare in finance. But reversing it is uncommon and unfun for all parties.</p><p>You cannot take exception simply because you feel like it. You must communicate one of twelve enumerated reasons. The general flavor of them is “that account has no assets in it”, “that account number doesn’t correspond to an account that exists in this universe”, “the person who you claim has authorized this transfer doesn’t own that account”, etc.</p><p>Questions about title, about who really owns the assets in an account, sound really simple to non-specialists who are mostly familiar with individual accounts. John owns the money in John’s accounts, right?</p><p>Hah, hah, hah.</p><p>The “edge cases” cover <em>trillions of dollars</em>.</p><p>John and Mary just divorced and while the account records reflect John as sole owner, the divorce decree says Mary owns half of the account. Your blockchain disagrees with an Article III judge? Then your blockchain is wrong. Fix your blockchain.</p><p>These determinations are <em>fact-intensive</em> and, again, are not necessarily obvious to either brokerage or even to the account owner themselves. John very likely thinks he owns his own money and <em>may</em> even think that in a sincere and innocent fashion. The brokerage doesn’t have actual possession of a divorce decree and very likely has no actual knowledge of a contemplated divorce. It <em>doesn’t matter</em>.</p><p>Tick tock tick tock. FINRA doesn’t care. The orderly operation of capitalism must go on, private tragedies notwithstanding, and your brokerage must make a determination before three business days are up. Validate or take exception. Those are <em>your only two options</em>.</p><p>Now let’s superimpose another difficult reality on this one: brokerages will, in the ordinary course of business, spend long periods of time happily having no <em>real</em> communication with their customers. Oh sure, their customer will receive account statements, and they might even place trades, but the last time a human talked to another human was… early in the 2010s?</p><p>Ping, ping, incoming message from ACATS. John <em>purportedly</em> wants to move his assets. The shot clock has begun. You have three business days.</p><p>Does the phone number on file from 2004 still work for John? FINRA doesn’t care. Does John still use AOL? FINRA doesn’t care. Can the United States Postal Service successfully put a piece of paper in John’s hand within three business days? FINRA doesn’t care. Will John pick up the phone for an unknown caller attempting to reach him on a matter of urgency? FINRA doesn’t care. Is John in the hospital on his deathbed? FINRA doesn’t care.</p><p>Brokerages are broadly competent and they know all of this. They know they cannot, at scale, successfully verify all of the transfers for all of the customers. And so they make a business decision to not contact customers for most transfers <em>by count</em> and reserve extraordinary efforts for contacting only very important customers, who might be most transfers <em>by volume of assets.</em></p><p>The brokerage will absolutely not phrase this as “We don’t verify outgoing transfers.” They will check, and check most diligently, that the account number claimed is the account number, that the name matches the name on file, etc. And their Operations team understands that <a href="https://www.kalzumeus.com/2010/06/17/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-names/">sometimes names do not match</a> and that is OK, and sometimes it means Nope That’s A Specially Enumerated Exception Right There.</p><p>Sometimes they will look at the signature card, because everyone enjoys live action roleplaying occasionally. If John cannot in 2024 reproduce his signature from 2004, I have an epic non-surprise for you: FINRA doesn’t care. But, hey, it is the culture of the United States that financial institutions and expert witnesses in court sometimes do forensic analysis. Do we believe it is possible to compare signatures and gain useful information? Do we believe in the tooth fairy? Yes in some ways and no in others. We take no important decisions premised mostly on belief in the tooth fairy. And, again, “/s/ John Q. Public” is a <em>normal and accepted</em> way to represent John’s consent to move assets.</p><p>Small account transfers with paperwork that has no glaring errors will be approved in the ordinary course. Sometimes those transfers will be fraudulent. Brokerages defrauded in this fashion will be annoyed, but not surprised, because they are competent financial institutions. They understand that the <a href="https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/optimal-amount-of-fraud/">optimal amount of fraud</a> is not zero.</p><p>So what, ultimately, is a brokerage <em>relying upon</em> when it sends money to /s/ John Q. Public? It is relying on chained trust in a community of practice, and on a web of contracts, and on a business decision, all at once.</p><p>And that means that if a bad guy can convince any brokerage in the U.S. that it is John, the bad guy can fairly reliably cause movement of all of John’s financial assets.</p><h2 id="recent-developments-in-acats-fraud">Recent developments in ACATS fraud</h2><p>You can probably guess the shape of the attack. </p><p>Get a copy of John’s ID from, perhaps, <a href="https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/the-fraud-supply-chain/" rel="noreferrer">a vendor specializing in “fullz”</a> on the Dark Web. Figure out where John keeps his accounts by e.g. just guessing that it might be one of the places where 80% of Americans with assets keep their retirement accounts. Open up an app, tap tap tap, request to move “your” assets to “your” new account. And then lie about <em>being</em> John while telling some truths you know <em>about</em> John.</p><p>Now, wait five to seven business days.</p><p>Congrats, John’s assets now appear to be in “your” brokerage account. Your brokerage is in the business of giving you access to “your” money swiftly when you want it. Now would be a great time to wire it out, take it out on that debit card connected to the account, place a trade which successfully transfers value to a confederate’s account, etc etc.</p><p>Five to seven business days is much more frequent than many Americans, even many wealthy Americans, check their brokerage accounts, and so the money may be spendable before any involved human realizes it has been taken improperly.</p><p>This is, obviously, super duper illegal. But in another sense it is just business. For you, as a criminal, this is Tuesday. And for brokerages, well, capitalism hopes they catch <em>most</em> people trying this.</p><p>Some brokerages have not successfully caught some people trying this. That is normal and expected. Some brokerages have not successfully caught a rather large number of people trying this.</p><p>That was a bit concerning. To FINRA, for example, which has <a href="https://www.finra.org/media-center/finra-unscripted/new-account-fraud-preventing-acats">a podcast episode</a> about how it coordinated an industry-wide fact finding process to issue a pair of <a href="https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/notices/22-21">Reg</a> <a href="https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/notices/23-06">Notices</a> to let the industry know about this new Wild West of criminality and how to deal with it.</p><p>Now, the most sophisticated and competent brokerages already had large security teams working on this problem. But again, some brokerages aren’t nearly as large and well-resourced as a non-specialist might suspect.</p><p>Also, how to say this delicately: competence is unevenly distributed in the world. Sometimes this is wonderful; you can pick diamonds in the rough out on the Internet, who have no institutional backing but nonetheless achieve incredible results in deep areas of human endeavor. And sometimes the odd spike is in the other direction: a regulated institution has an important function headed up by a well-credentialed, impeccably pedigreed, speaks-at-conferences, well-liked-by-colleagues-and-friends individual who capitalism should not want in the chair they currently occupy.</p><p>A digression: It is considered very impolite in the U.S. professional managerial class to observe that a particular, named professional manager is incompetent at their job. An individual who makes a habit of it will be optimized out of decisionmaking processes featuring PMC members, which is… all decisionmaking processes, effectively. That deviant is ipso facto disruptive to orderly operations and also a bit of a career risk to be in the same room with. And so, even if you know someone to be incompetent, part of being an effective PMC class member in an executive position is to learn the approved euphemisms and rituals.</p><p>Anyhow, FINRA issued Reg Notices after a drawn out and somewhat ponderous process, for institutional reasons. They contain some mitigation recommendations that rhyme with “If a customer signs up for an account with you and doesn’t know where their brokerage account currently is, and sequentially asks you to transfer accounts at each of the top 10 brokerages in the U.S., perhaps you might want to look into that.”</p><p>When you phrase it like that, it might sound obvious. But for <a href="https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/seeing-like-a-bank/">Seeing Like A Bank</a> reasons, the actual screen in front of the actual operations professional who is actually making a the-shot-clock-is-ticking decision on John’s accounts might not display that “John” has recently made four ACATS requests that were each rejected for non-existence. One objective of the Reg Notices is activating a ponderous machine that will eventually get a technologist deep in the bowels in the least sexy part of a brokerage to <em>fix that screen</em>.</p><h2 id="should-i-be-terrified-patrick">Should I be terrified, Patrick?</h2><p>This is all normal and working as designed! Capitalism will function on Monday pretty much like it did on Friday! Your assets are safe in an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eventual_consistency">eventually consistent</a> sort of way; your brokerage will eventually come around to agreeing with your view on the matter, regardless of what their first communication says.</p><p>If you get mugged in San Francisco, society expresses sympathy, kinda, but you are never going to see your wallet again.</p><p>Finance. Does. Not. Work. This. Way.</p><p>If your brokerage makes a mistake with your assets, and they have before and will again make many mistakes, then <em>they will make you whole</em>. Financial institutions have capital <em>for a reason</em>. There is a budget for operating losses. There is a budget for fraud losses. The aggregate expenditure of effort by society in solving this problem greatly exceeds the aggregate expenditure of effort by society in solving muggings.</p><p>If your balance suddenly goes to zero in a surprising fashion, that will be very stressful for you but they <em>are</em> eventually good for it, with <em>very</em> high probability.</p><p>Some people hire a lawyer to resolve this and it’s just about the easiest letter for a lawyer to write: Here’s my best understanding of what my client owns. You think they own nothing. Fix this immediately or tell me in writing why you have decided not to. Lawsuits subsequent to fraudulent transfers and the brokerage deciding that, on reflection, no, they did the right thing are <em>extremely uncommon</em>, both in absolute numbers and as a percentage of all fraudulent transfers. But the nuclear option exists for those very, very, very few customers who need it to compel action.</p><p>Should we be <em>satisfied</em> with this? Probably not at the current margin.</p><p>Many people who own, and depend upon, assets are not competent enough to project manage the resolution pathway here, and may (<em>largely wrongly</em>) assume that they have been stolen from in a durable fashion. Some might come to this (<em>mistaken</em>) point of view because they talked to a front line customer service representative of the brokerage who, and this is aggravating but it will happen at least once today even in a regulated institution, just makes shit up rather than reading the Emergency Escalations list printed in their cubicle. Some might come to this (<em>mistaken</em>) point of view because their brokerage of choice is other-than-competent at answering utterly routine inquiries and instead they get their information about capitalism from the first person who replies on Reddit, who is not necessarily the custodian of Reddit’s best answer to the question.</p><h2 id="another-fun-wonky-control">Another fun wonky control</h2><p>Brokerages control many accounts worth $20,000 and some accounts worth millions or much more. Frequently, the formal text of the rules will treat those accounts equivalently. Go read the rule if you have any doubt; there is no This User Is Rich exception anywhere in it. Three business days, FINRA doesn’t care.</p><p>One (optional!) control that some institutions use is called a “medallion guarantee”, and it’s a fascinating combination of a physical artifact and a contractual risk transfer.</p><p>The receiving institution, who may be ultimately liable (to an action from the transferring institution, to recover the assets they already re-bought for the customer out of their risk budget) for a fraudulent transfer, can optionally require a customer to get a “medallion” issued to move the risk to another institution. Hilariously, that institution can in principle be totally uninvolved.</p><p>What is a medallion? A piece of paper that has a number on it and represents a promise. In brief form, that promise is “I, a financial institution who is <em>absolutely</em> good for this guarantee, warrant that <em>I know this to be John</em>. The paper attached to this medallion is authorized by John; <em>he told me so</em>. And if I was wrong, and <em>I am not wrong</em>, I will no-muss no-fuss reimburse you up to $_______.”</p><p>So John, when he tells a new company that he would like to move in about $1 million, might get asked to go get a $1 million medallion.</p><p>You might think this rhymes with notary services and it rhymes with insurance. All institutions involved will claim it is absolutely not notarization (a state function delegated to private individuals, who are almost universally not good for a million dollars if they screw up) and it is absolutely not insurance (a regulated industry).</p><p>Also, medallions are generally free. That surprises people, particularly people who model them as specialized insurance contracts.</p><p>The thresholds at which institutions request a medallion vary based on their own policies, but you might reasonably expect $500,000 or $1 million to be important thresholds. If you have an account with a million dollars in it, <em>anywhere</em>, your bank very probably loves you and wants you to be happy. Want a coffee? Stop by any time, they will happily give you a coffee. Charge for the coffee? <em>Laughable</em>. Oh you need an admissible proof of identity for a very wonky financial industry operations issue? Happy to oblige, sir, we are here for any of your diverse financial needs. Can I get you a coffee while you wait.</p><p>Yes, the bank is taking risk when issuing a medallion. But it’s a tiny, tiny, tiny risk from their perspective, which insulates the receiving company from a huge risk. The bank has many years of history over which they’ve become thoroughly convinced that John is John. The receiving institution has somebody claiming to be John who spent six minutes filling out an onboarding form in a mobile app. And so the largest firms in capitalism somewhere have a spreadsheet for how much they spent on medallions, much like they can (with difficulty) come up with a pretty exact number for how much they spent on toilet paper.</p><p>Toilet paper is substantially more expensive in aggregate even though no individual square of toilet paper has ever caused a $1 million wire.</p><p>And, thus, medallions. Most Americans will never see one in their lives. The typical mass affluent user is most likely to see one precisely once, right around retirement age, when e.g. moving their 401k to a new custodian.</p><p>But if you’re reading Bits about Money, you are much more likely to get asked for this quaint ritual than the population is at large, and now you know why. And perhaps you won’t be as frustrated as the typical person asked for a medallion, who fumes “Why do I have to walk into a bank just to get them to write ‘Yeah that’s John’ on a piece of paper? Everyone knows I’m John. My drivers license says I’m John. I already gave that to the brokerage. I swear, the entire financial industry is staffed by incompetents.”</p><h2 id="a-final-acats-story">A final ACATS story</h2><p>Once upon a time there was a financial technologist.</p><p>He made it his routine practice to buy just a few shares of every bank he worked with. This was not to make money, it was so that he could write a letter to Investor Relations if there was ever an issue he needed to <a href="https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/seeing-like-a-bank/" rel="noreferrer">escalate</a> out of Customer Service purgatory. Investor Relations is highly placed in the org chart of banks and does not relish telling Investors they Relate to that their princess is in another castle.</p><p>Some time later, that customer caused another financial institution to ACATS out some assets, including the shares of that bank. Unfortunately, that bank had in the interim had a <a href="https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/requiem-for-a-bank-loan/" rel="noreferrer">spot of trouble</a>, and their stock had ended up on a "penny stock" list.</p><p>Many large, competent financial institutions have a rule about penny stocks, and it rounds to "absolutely not." And so the financial institution objected to its customer, claiming that it could not process the ACATS request, because it contained a trivial amount of equity in a bank.</p><p>In a bit of potent irony, the objecting financial institution owned the bank it objected to holding equity in.</p><p>Sometimes, the behavior of a financial institution in the moment looks insane. Often, if you play back history, the insanity is explicable as emerging from individually reasonable actions by several separate parties with only a partial view of the facts.</p><p>And, of course, playing history forward, this was trivially resolved. Just another day at the office.</p>

<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Simple</strong>: You can add Spot as a simple dependency to your project and start
building your UI right away. No need to use additional tools or code
generation steps. Just write Go code and get a native GUI application as a
self-contained binary.</li>
<li><strong>Cross-platform</strong>: Spot uses native widgets where available and
automatically selects the best backend for the platform you are running on
at compile time. Currently, two backend implementations are provided: one
based on <a href="https://fltk.org/" rel="nofollow">FLTK</a> using
<a href="https://github.com/pwiecz/go-fltk">go-fltk</a> and one based on Cocoa using
(<a href="https://github.com/roblillack/gocoa">a modified version of</a>)
<a href="https://github.com/mojbro/gocoa">gocoa</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Reactive</strong>: Spot automatically updates the UI when the state of the
application changes. You just provide side-effect free rendering functions
and manage the state of your application using the <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/roblillack/spot#UseState" rel="nofollow"><code>UseState</code></a> hook.</li>
<li><strong>Broad widget support</strong>: Spot provides a wide range of UI controls out of
the box, including buttons, labels, text inputs, sliders, dropdowns, and
more. See the full list:
<a href="#list-of-supported-ui-controls">List of supported UI controls</a>.</li>

<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">What does "reactive" mean?</h4><a id="user-content-what-does-reactive-mean" aria-label="Permalink: What does &quot;reactive&quot; mean?" href="#what-does-reactive-mean"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">In the context of Spot, <em>reactive</em> means that the UI is automatically updated
when the state of the application changes. This is achieved by re-building an
immutable component tree upon state changes which can quickly be compared to
the previous state in order to determine what UI controls need to be updated.
In the web world, this idea is often called a "virtual DOM" and Spot actually
started as an experiment to bring this concept to Go by implementing a
React-like GUI library for the desktop.</p>
<p dir="auto">By using a reactive model, the developer does not need to worry about updating
the UI manually. Instead, the developer can focus on the application logic and
let Spot take care of updating the UI.</p>

<p dir="auto">Currently, Spot uses a Cocoa backend on macOS and a FLTK-based one on all other
platforms. Optionally, FLTK can be used on the Mac, too. Better support for
Windows is planned for the future.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Can I implement my own hooks?</h4><a id="user-content-can-i-implement-my-own-hooks" aria-label="Permalink: Can I implement my own hooks?" href="#can-i-implement-my-own-hooks"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Yes, just like in React, you can implement your own hooks. Just create a
function which takes a <code>*spot.RenderContext</code> as first argument and use this to
"hook" into the Spot lifecycle by calling <code>spot.UseState</code>, <code>spot.UseEffect</code>,
etc. Convention here is to prefix the function with <code>Use…</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How do I write custom components?</h4><a id="user-content-how-do-i-write-custom-components" aria-label="Permalink: How do I write custom components?" href="#how-do-i-write-custom-components"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">There are a few different ways to separate your UI into components in Spot;
for some ideas, check out the <code>custom-components</code> example. The main way to
write custom components is to create a struct that implements the
<code>spot.Component</code> interface. This interface has a single method,
<code>Render(ctx *spot.RenderContext) spot.Component</code>, which is called to render
the component. Components created like this can be used in the same way as
the built-in ones.</p>
<p dir="auto">Look at the <code>BlinkingButton</code> component in the example to see how this is done.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Can I use Spot with a completely different widget library than the provided one?</h4><a id="user-content-can-i-use-spot-with-a-completely-different-widget-library-than-the-provided-one" aria-label="Permalink: Can I use Spot with a completely different widget library than the provided one?" href="#can-i-use-spot-with-a-completely-different-widget-library-than-the-provided-one"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Yes, you can. You just need to create some structs that implement the
<code>spot.Component</code> interface and which take care of managing the native widgets.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Can I use <code>spot/ui</code>, but with a different backend than Cocoa or FLTK?</h4><a id="user-content-can-i-use-spotui-but-with-a-different-backend-than-cocoa-or-fltk" aria-label="Permalink: Can I use spot/ui, but with a different backend than Cocoa or FLTK?" href="#can-i-use-spotui-but-with-a-different-backend-than-cocoa-or-fltk"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Currently, these are the only backends that are supported. But feel free to
create a PR if you want to add support for another backend. <em>*hint hint*</em></p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">What's the difference between <code>spot/ui</code> and <code>spot</code>?</h4><a id="user-content-whats-the-difference-between-spotui-and-spot" aria-label="Permalink: What's the difference between spot/ui and spot?" href="#whats-the-difference-between-spotui-and-spot"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><code>spot</code> is the core package that provides the reactive model and the rendering
functionality. It is backend-agnostic and can be used with any set of controls
which implement the <code>spot.Control</code> interface.</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>spot/ui</code> is a package that provides a set of pre-built cross-platform GUI
controls that which can be used with <code>spot</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">What's the difference between a “component” and a “control”?</h4><a id="user-content-whats-the-difference-between-a-component-and-a-control" aria-label="Permalink: What's the difference between a “component” and a “control”?" href="#whats-the-difference-between-a-component-and-a-control"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">In Spot, a <em>component</em> is a logical unit of the application that contains
business logic and state. Any component is made out of other componens and
can ultimately be rendered down to a single or multiple "controls".</p>
<p dir="auto">A <em>control</em> is special kind component is mounted to the UI tree and represents
a visual element on the screen. Usually a control is backed by a native
implementation of the GUI backend, like a button, a label, or a text input.</p>

<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><em>Make</em>: The process of creating a new component instance. This is done by
creating a reference to an instance of a struct that implements the
<code>spot.Component</code> interface or by calling <code>spot.Make</code> with a render function.</p>

<li>
<p dir="auto"><em>Render</em>: The process of applying a component's state to its building blocks
and hereby returning another component instance. This is done by calling the
<code>Render</code> method on a component instance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><em>Build</em>: The process of creating a new UI tree from a component instance.
This is done by <em>recursively</em> rendering a component to create a tree of

or <code>spot.BuildFn</code> with a render function.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><em>Mount</em>: The process of creating real UI controls from a (virtual) tree of

		<h3>Abstract</h3>
		<p>We investigate whether an LLM can successfully perform financial statement analysis in a way similar to a professional human analyst. We provide standardized and anonymous financial statements to GPT4 and instruct the model to analyze them to determine the direction of future earnings. Even without any narrative or industry-specific information, the LLM outperforms financial analysts in its ability to predict earnings changes. The LLM exhibits a relative advantage over human analysts in situations when the analysts tend to struggle. Furthermore, we find that the prediction accuracy of the LLM is on par with the performance of a narrowly trained state-of-the-art ML model. LLM prediction does not stem from its training memory. Instead, we find that the LLM generates useful narrative insights about a company's future performance. Lastly, our trading strategies based on GPT's predictions yield a higher Sharpe ratio and alphas than strategies based on other models. Taken together, our results suggest that LLMs may take a central role in decision-making. </p>

The <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://gizmodo.com/google-shopping-ai-search-generative-experience-1851028975&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://gizmodo.com/google-shopping-ai-search-generative-experience-1851028975">AI is hallucinating</a></span> answers to several user queries, creating a less-than-trustworthy experience across Google’s flagship product. In the last week, Gizmodo received AI overviews from Google that reference <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://gizmodo.com/worst-google-ai-answers-glue-pizza-dogs-playing-sports-1851495298&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://gizmodo.com/worst-google-ai-answers-glue-pizza-dogs-playing-sports-1851495298">glue-topped pizza</a></span> and suggest Barack Obama was Muslim.<br></p><p>The hallucinations are concerning, but not entirely surprising. Like we’ve seen before with AI chatbots, this technology seems to confuse satire with journalism – several of the incorrect AI overviews we found seem to reference <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theonion.com/geologists-recommend-eating-at-least-one-small-rock-per-1846655112&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theonion.com/geologists-recommend-eating-at-least-one-small-rock-per-1846655112">The Onion</a></span>. The problem is that this AI offers an authoritative answer to millions of people who turn to Google Search daily to just look something up. Now, at least some of these people will be presented with hallucinated answers.</p><p>“The vast majority of AI Overviews provide high quality information, with links to dig deeper on the web,” said a Google spokesperson in an emailed statement to Gizmodo, noting many of the examples the company has seen have been from uncommon queries. “We’re taking swift action where appropriate under our content policies, and using these examples to develop broader improvements to our systems, some of which have already started to roll out.<strong>”</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>In my experience, AI overviews are more often right than wrong.  However, every wrong answer I get makes me question my entire experience on Google Search even more – I have to asses each answer carefully. Google notes that AI is “experimental” but they’ve opted everyone into this experiment by default.</p><p>“The thing with Search — we handle billions of queries,” Google CEO Sundar Pichai told <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theverge.com/24158374/google-ceo-sundar-pichai-ai-search-gemini-future-of-the-internet-web-openai-decoder-interview&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theverge.com/24158374/google-ceo-sundar-pichai-ai-search-gemini-future-of-the-internet-web-openai-decoder-interview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Verge</a></span> on Monday when asked about the AI overview rollout. “You can absolutely find a query and hand it to me and say, ‘Could we have done better on that query?’ Yes, for sure. But in many cases, part of what is making people respond positively to AI Overviews is that the summary we are providing clearly adds value and helps them look at things they may not have otherwise thought about.”</p><p>Strangely, Google Search occasionally responds to a query with “An AI overview is not available for this search,” while other times, Google will just not say anything and show traditional search results. I got this answer when I searched “what ethnicity are most US presidents” and when I searched “what fruits end in me.”</p><figure id="" data-id="f70bb6ae125cd44692ce2178afc54c5e" data-recommend-id="image://f70bb6ae125cd44692ce2178afc54c5e" data-format="png" data-width="746" data-height="218" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><div><picture><source media="(max-width: 37.31em)" type="image/jpeg" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-srcset="https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/f70bb6ae125cd44692ce2178afc54c5e.jpg"><source media="(min-width: 37.37em)" type="image/jpeg" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-srcset="https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/f70bb6ae125cd44692ce2178afc54c5e.jpg"><img alt="Image for article titled Google Search Is Now a Giant Hallucination" data-chomp-id="f70bb6ae125cd44692ce2178afc54c5e" data-format="png" data-height="218" data-alt="Image for article titled Google Search Is Now a Giant Hallucination" data-anim-src="" data-src="https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/f70bb6ae125cd44692ce2178afc54c5e.jpg" src="https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/f70bb6ae125cd44692ce2178afc54c5e.jpg"></picture></div><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Google Search</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f70bb6ae125cd44692ce2178afc54c5e" data-recommend-id="image://f70bb6ae125cd44692ce2178afc54c5e" data-format="png" data-width="746" data-height="218" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>A Google spokesperson says its systems occasionally start generating an AI overview, but stop it from appearing when it doesn’t meet its quality threshold.

It’s unclear if this “stop and start” AI overview generation is related.</p><p>What is clear is that Google felt pressured to put its money where its mouth is, and that means putting AI into Search. People are increasingly choosing ChatGPT, Perplexity, or other AI offerings as their main way to find information on the internet. Google views this race existentially, but it may have just jeopardized the Search experience by trying to catch up.</p><p>This week, Google Search has told people a lot of strange things through AI overviews.
