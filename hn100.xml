     NAME
          gb, gba, nes, snes - emulators

     SYNOPSIS
          games/gb [ -acd ] [ -C ... ] [ -x scale ] [ -li addr ]
          romfile
          games/gba [ -a ] [ -b biosfile ] [ -s savetype ] [ -g
          gpiotype ] [ -x scale ] romfile
          games/nes [ -aos ] [ -x scale ] romfile
          games/snes [ -ahms ] [ -x scale ] romfile

     DESCRIPTION
          Gb, gba, nes and snes are emulators for the Nintendo Game
          Boy and Game Boy Color (GB and GBC), Nintendo Game Boy
          Advance (GBA), Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), and
          Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES).  They execute
          the romfile given as an argument.  The z, x, a, s, q, w,
          return and shift keys correspond to B, A, Y, X, L1, L2,
          Start and Select, respectively.  Other keys:

          F1   Pause the emulator. If already paused it will step one
               video frame.

          F5   Save the current state in gb.save / gba.save / nes.save
               / snes.save.

          F6   Load the current state from gb.save / gba.save /
               nes.save / snes.save.

          F12  Toggle the emulator's speedometer.  It shows in the
               upper left, off-viewport corner, the ratio between the
               expected and observed time it took to draw 60 frames.

          t    Toggle tracing of the emulator.

          `    It uncaps the 60fps frame rate and lets emulation go as
               fast as possible.

          Esc  Pause the emulator.

          Del  Exit the emulator.

          Command line options:

          -a   Enable audio output.

          -x   Scale the screen to a given factor regardless of the

          -c   Run GBC roms in GBC mode and DMG (GB) roms in GBC's DMG
               compatibility mode.

          -d   Run GB roms in DMG mode. GBC-only roms will not run in
               this mode; others will run only in black &amp; white.

          -Cnnnnnn,nnnnnn,nnnnnn,nnnnnn
               Select a color palette. Has no effect on roms in color
               mode. The syntax is of the form -C
               ffffff,aaaaaa,555555,000000 (using HTML style rrggbb
               notation).

          -liaddr
               These enable serial port connectivity emulation using
               the network. The -l flag configures the listening part-
               ner, whereas -i configures the dialing partner. The
               connection is established before the rom starts.  Com-
               munication is synchronous, emulation will stall while
               waiting for the other partner.

          gba options:

          -b   Location of the GBA BIOS file (required to operate the
               emulator). Default is /sys/games/lib/gbabios.bin.

          -s   Save format used by the original game. Valid formats
               are: eeprom4, eeprom64, sram256, flash512, flash1024.
               The number corresponds to the size, in kilobits, of the
               save file. By default, the emulator attempts to auto-
               matically detect the save format, but does not always
               succeed.  Some roms require a specific flash device id
               which may need to be set manually for them to work.
               Valid formats and corresponding ids are: flash512
               (SST), flash512mx (Macronix 64K), flash512pan (Pana-
               sonic), flash512atm (Atmel), flash1024 (Macronix 128K),
               flash1024san (Sanyo).

          -g   GPIO hardware used by the original game. The only valid
               type currently is rtc (real time clock).  By default,
               the emulator attempts to automatically detect the GPIO
               hardware using the game code found in the rom header.

          nes options:

          -o   Hide the top and bottom eight pixels (overscan area),
               like a real television would.

          -s   Save contents of battery backed SRAM (used by some
               games for savegames) as a file (gb and snes automati-
               cally detect if this is needed).

          snes options:

     <a href="http://man.9front.org/1/NINTENDO">NINTENDO(1)</a>                                           <a href="http://man.9front.org/1/NINTENDO">NINTENDO(1)</a>

          -h   Override HiROM/LoROM detection: -h sets LoROM, -hh sets
               HiROM.

          -m   Enable mouse emulation using system mouse. Mouse button
               1 (left button) engages the SNES left mouse button.
               Mouse button 3 (right button) engages the SNES right
               mouse button. Holding down mouse button 2 (middle but-
               ton) disengages the SNES mouse entirely so that the
               Plan 9 cursor offset can be adjusted to align with the
               SNES cursor.

          Each of these emulators support the use of joysticks via
          <a href="http://man.9front.org/1/joy">joy(1)</a>. Nes also supports selecting the joystick for either
          player 1 or 2.

     BUGS
          You bet!
          SRAM saving on the NES only functions when the -s option is
          used.
          The SNES horizontal hires mode is supported only with -2
          scaling.
          All emulators assume a North American (i.e. NTSC) system.
          PAL games (and in some cases Japanese games) are not sup-
          ported.
          The serial link emulation has issues with desynchronization
          in timing dependent scenarios.

<!-- cache hit 492:single/related:76687c0f5dc9de270e9d2617cc213305 --><!-- empty -->
<p>Starting in March with the release of iOS 17.4, iPhones in the European Union have been subject to the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA), a batch of regulations that (among other things) forced Apple to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/apple-announces-sweeping-eu-app-store-policy-changes-including-sideloading/">support alternate app stores</a>, app sideloading, and third-party browser engines in iOS for the first time. Today, EU regulators announced that they are also categorizing Apple's iPadOS as a "gatekeeper," meaning that the iPad will soon be subject to the same regulations as the iPhone.</p>

<p>The EU began investigating whether iPadOS would qualify as a gatekeeper in September 2023, the same day it decided that iOS, the Safari browser, and the App Store were all gatekeepers.</p>
<p>"Apple now has six months to ensure full compliance of iPadOS with the DMA obligations," <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_24_2363">reads</a> the EU's blog post about the change.</p>
<p>Apple technically split the iPad's operating system from the iPhone's in 2019 when it began calling its tablet operating system "iPadOS" instead of iOS. But practically speaking, little separates the two operating systems under the hood. Both iOS and iPadOS share the same software build numbers, they're updated in lockstep (<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/08/facing-quality-and-pacing-issues-apple-reportedly-delays-ipados-16/#:~:text=Apple%20will%20delay%20the%20release,with%20knowledge%20of%20the%20matter.">with rare exceptions</a>), and most importantly for DMA compliance purposes, they pull software from the same locked-down App Store with the same Apple-imposed restrictions in place.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>Apps distributed through alternate app stores or third-party websites will have to abide by many of Apple's rules and will still generally be limited to using Apple's public APIs. However, the ability to use alternate app stores and browser engines on the iPad's large screen (and the desktop-class M-series chips) could make the tablets better laptop replacements by allowing them to do more of the things that Mac users can do on their systems.</p>
<p>Though Apple has made multiple changes to iOS in the EU to comply with the DMA, EU regulators <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/03/apple-google-and-meta-are-failing-dma-compliance-eu-suspects/">are already investigating Apple</a> (as well as Google and Meta) for "non-compliance." Depending on the results of that investigation, the EU may require Apple to make more changes to the way it allows third-party apps to be installed in iOS and to the way that third-party developers are allowed to advertise non-Apple app store and payment options. Any changes that Apple makes to iOS to comply with the investigation's findings will presumably trickle down to the iPad as well.</p>
<p>Of course, none of this directly affects US-based iPhone or iPad users, whose devices remain restricted to Apple's app stores and the WebKit browsing engine. That said, we have seen some recent App Store rule changes that have arguably trickled down from Apple's attempts to comply with the DMA, most notably <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/04/apple-now-allows-retro-game-emulators-on-its-app-store-but-with-big-caveats/">policy changes</a> that have allowed (<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/04/why-a-gamecube-wii-emulator-may-not-be-possible-on-the-ios-app-store/">some, not all</a>) retro game console emulators <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/04/a-touchscreen-of-nostalgia-delta-brings-classic-nintendo-consoles-to-ios/">into the App Store for the first time</a>.</p>

<h2 id="introduction"><span>1. </span>Introduction</h2>

<p>Every SQL database engine works in roughly the same way:  It first 
translates the input SQL text into a "prepared statement".  Then it "executes"
the prepared statement to generate a result.

</p><p>A prepared statement is an object that represents the steps needed
accomplish the input SQL.  Or, to think of it in another way,
the prepared statement is the SQL statement translated into a form that is
more easily understood by the computer.

</p><p>In SQLite, a prepared statement is an instance of the
<a href="https://sqlite.org/draft/c3ref/stmt.html">sqlite3_stmt object</a>.  In other systems, the prepared
statement is usually an internal data structure that is not directly visible to
the application programmer.  Developers of other SQL database engines
do not necessary call these objects "prepared statements".
But such objects exists, whatever they might be called.
This paper will use the term "prepared statement".

</p><p>There are countless ways of implementing a prepared statement.  This
paper will look at the two most common methods:

</p><ol>
<li><p>
<b>Bytecode</b> →  The input SQL is translated into a virtual machine language
that is then run by a virtual machine interpreter.  This is the technique
used by SQLite.

</p></li><li><p>
<b>Tree-Of-Objects</b> → The input SQL is translated in a tree of objects
that represent the processing to be done.  The SQL is executed by walking this
tree.  This is the technique used by MySQL and PostgreSQL.
</p></li></ol>

<p>
There are advantages and disadvantages to each of these representations of
a prepared statement.  The purpose of this paper is to articulate some of those
advantages and disadvantages.

</p><h2 id="how_to_provide_feedback"><span>1.1. </span>How To Provide Feedback</h2>

<p>
This document is written from the perspective of the original author of SQLite.
If you disagree with any of the opinions offered in this document, you are
welcomed to offer corrections and/or contrary views on the
<a href="https://sqlite.org/forum">SQLite Forum</a>.  Or you can email the author
directly.

</p><h2 id="definition_of_bytecode_"><span>1.2. </span>Definition Of "Bytecode"</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://sqlite.org/draft/opcode.html">bytecode generated by SQLite</a> might be a little different from what
many readers think of as bytecode.  The bytecode used (for example) by the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine">Java virtual machine</a> or
by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAssembly">WebAssembly</a> consists almost
entirely of low-level operations, similar to what physical CPUs implement:
basic math operators, comparisons, conditional jumps, and
instructions to move content between different memory locations.  SQLite bytecode
has these kinds of low-level instructions, too.  But SQLite bytecode also contains
some high-level operations that are specific to the needs of a database engine.
Here are just a few examples:

</p><ul>
<li><p><b>OP_Column</b> → Extract the value from the N-th column of the
database row that a particular cursor is currently pointing at.
</p></li><li><p><b>OP_CreateBtree</b> → Allocate space for a new B-Tree in the
database file.
</p></li><li><p><b>OP_ParseSchema</b> → Reread and reparse all or part of the the 
<a href="https://sqlite.org/draft/schematab.html">sqlite_schema table</a> and refresh internal symbol tables accordingly.
</p></li><li><p><b>OP_SeekGE</b> → Move a cursor on a particular B-Tree to the first
entry that is greater than or equal to a given key.
</p></li><li><p><b>OP_Next</b> → Advance a cursor on a particular B-Tree to the next
entry in the B-Tree and jump, or fall through if there are no more entries in that
B-Tree.
</p></li></ul>

<p>In other words, the "bytecode" used by SQLite is not so much a set of CPU
instructions as it is a list of database primitives that are to be run
in a particular order.

</p><h2 id="definition_of_abstract_syntax_tree_or_ast_"><span>1.3. </span>Definition Of "Abstract Syntax Tree" or "AST"</h2>

<p>
An "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree">Abstract Syntax Tree</a>" or AST
is a data structure that describes a program or statement in some kind of formal
language.  In our context, the formal language is SQL.  An AST is typically
implemented as a tree of objects where each object represents one small part of
the overall SQL statement.  ASTs emerge naturally from parsers for formal languages.
The usual technique is to use an 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LALR_parser">LALR(1) parser</a>.
With such a parser, each terminal
symbol holds metadata that will become a leaf of the AST, and each non-terminal 
symbol holds metadata that will become a sub-branch of the overall AST.
As rules of the grammar are "reduced" by the parser, new nodes of the AST are
allocated and connected to subnodes.
After the parse completes, the start-symbol of the grammar is left holding the
root of the AST.

</p><p>An AST is a tree of objects.  But an AST is not a suitable form for
a prepared statement.  After being generated, an AST first needs to be
transformed in various ways before it can executed.  Symbols need to be
resolved.  Semantic rules need to be checked.  Optimizations need to be
applied that transform input SQL statement into different forms that
execute more quickly.  Finally, the AST needs to be translated into an
alternative representation that is more amenable to execution.

</p><p>Some people refer to the tree of objects that is used as the
executable form for MySQL and PostgreSQL as an AST.  The is probably a
misuse of the term "AST", because by the time the tree of objects is
ready to be executed, it has been changed so much that it has little
resemblance to the original SQL text.  The confusion arises in part because
both the final prepared statement object and the original AST are both
trees of objects.  The usual technique is for the original AST that comes
directly out of the parser to be transformed little by little, in multiple
passes, until at the end it is fully converted into an tree of objects
that is no longer strictly an AST but that can be evaluated to
generate a result.  There is not necessarily a clear point during this
process when the tree-of-objects ceases to be an AST and becomes a
prepared statement instead.  And because there is no clear boundary between an
AST and a prepared statement, people often refer to a prepared statement
that is represented as a tree of objects as an "AST", even though that
description is not precise.

</p><h2 id="dataflow_programming"><span>1.4. </span>Dataflow Programming</h2>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dataflow_programming">Dataflow programming</a>
is a style of programming in which individual nodes specialize in doing
one small part of the overall computation.  Each node receives inputs from 
other nodes and sends its output to other nodes.  Thus the nodes form a
directed graph that carry inputs into outputs.

</p><p>
A "dataflow program" is perhaps a better description than "AST" for
the tree of objects that an SQL database engine uses as a prepared statement.

</p><h2 id="advantages_to_compiling_into_bytecode"><span>2. </span>Advantages To Compiling Into Bytecode</h2>

<p>SQLite compiles to bytecode, and the SQLite developers are very happy
with this approach.  Here is why:

</p><h2 id="bytecode_is_easier_to_understand"><span>2.1. </span>Bytecode Is Easier To Understand</h2>

<p>A flat list of opcodes can be easily printed to see exactly
how an SQL statement is being implemented.  This is what happens in SQLite
when you preface an SQL statement with the "EXPLAIN" keyword:  Instead of
actually running the SQL, the result is a listing of the bytecode
that would have been used to implement that SQL.

</p><p>Bytecode lends itself to this because a bytecode program is easily
represented as a table.  In SQLite bytecode, each instruction
has one opcode and five operands.  Thus a prepared statement can be
rendered as if it were a query against a six-column table.

</p><p>A tree-of-objects representation is more difficult to publish in
a human-readable form.  The objects that comprise the tree tend to
all be very different, and thus it is tricky to come up with a 
consistent and simple table representation with which to display
the objects.  Any any such table representation that you do come up
with would almost certainly have more than six column, probably many more.
The problem of rendering a tree-of-objects as a table is sufficiently
difficult that nobody does it, as far as I know.  Hence, no
tree-of-objects database engine provides the level
of detail in their "EXPLAIN" output that SQLite provides.

</p><h2 id="bytecode_is_easier_to_debug"><span>2.2. </span>Bytecode Is Easier To Debug</h2>

<p>Bytecode represents a clear separation between front-end parsing and
analyze and back-end evaluation of an SQL statement.  When problems arise
(incorrect answers and/or poor performance), the developers can examine
the bytecode to quickly isolate the source of the trouble to either the
front-end analysis or the back-end data storage sections of the product.

</p><p>In debugging builds of SQLite, the <a href="https://sqlite.org/draft/pragma.html#pragma_vdbe_trace">PRAGMA vdbe_trace=ON;</a> command will
cause a trace of the bytecode execution to appear on the console.

</p><h2 id="bytecode_can_be_run_incrementally"><span>2.3. </span>Bytecode Can Be Run Incrementally</h2>

<p>
SQL statements written in bytecode can be evaluated incrementally.
For example, a statement can be run until it generates just its first
row of output.  The statement then pauses until it is stepped again.
It is not necessary to run the statement to completion before examining
the first row of output.

</p><p>
This is more difficult to achieve in a tree-of-objects design.  When
the prepared statement is a tree-of-objects, execution is normally
accomplished by walking the tree.  To pause the statement in the middle
of a computation means unwinding the stack back up to the caller, all
the while saving enough state to resume evaluation where it last left
off.  This is not impossible to do, but it is sufficiently difficult that
I have never seen it actually done.

</p><p>
Most SQL database engines do not really need to do incremental
execution of prepared statements because most SQL database engines
are client/server.  In a client/server engines, a single SQL statement is sent
to the server, then the complete reply comes back over the wire
all at once.  Thus each statement runs to completion in a single go.
But SQLite is not client/server.  SQLite is a library
that runs in the same address space and using the same stack as the
application.  Being able to easily and reliably perform incremental
execution of an SQL statement is important to SQLite.

</p><h2 id="bytecode_is_smaller"><span>2.4. </span>Bytecode Is Smaller</h2>

<p>
The bytecode generated by SQLite is usually smaller than the corresponding
AST coming out of the parser.  During initial processing of SQL text
(during the call to <a href="https://sqlite.org/draft/c3ref/prepare.html">sqlite3_prepare()</a> and similar) both the AST and the
bytecode exist in memory at the same time and so more memory is used then.
But that is a transient state.  The AST
is quickly discarded and its memory recycled, even before the call to
<a href="https://sqlite.org/draft/c3ref/prepare.html">sqlite3_prepare()</a> returns, so that the resulting <a href="https://sqlite.org/draft/c3ref/stmt.html">prepared statement</a> ends
up consuming less memory in its bytecode representation than it did as an AST.
This is important because calls to <a href="https://sqlite.org/draft/c3ref/prepare.html">sqlite3_prepare()</a> are transient, but
prepared statements are often cached for possible reuse and persist in memory
for a long time.

</p><h2 id="bytecode_is_faster"><span>2.5. </span>Bytecode Is Faster</h2>

<p>
I <i>believe</i> that a bytecode representation of a prepared statement
runs faster, because fewer decisions need to be made for each step of
the computation.  Emphasis on "believe" in the previous sentence
→ it is difficult to verify
this claim experimentally since nobody has ever put in the multiple years
of effort necessary to generate equivalent bytecode and tree-of-object
representations of a prepared statement to see which one really does run faster.
We do know that <a href="https://sqlite.org/draft/fasterthanfs.html">SQLite is very fast</a>, but we
do not have good side-by-side comparisons with other SQL databases since
the other databases spend a lot of time doing client/server message processing,
and it is difficult to untangle the message round-trip overhead from the
actual processing time.

</p><h2 id="advantages_of_compiling_into_a_tree_of_objects"><span>3. </span>Advantages Of Compiling Into A Tree Of Objects</h2>

<p>Even though the SQLite developers think that the bytecode approach is
best, at least for the use cases the SQLite tries to fill, the
tree-of-objects approach to processing SQL does have some advantages over 
bytecode. There are always tradeoffs.

</p><h2 id="query_planning_decisions_can_be_deferred_until_runtime"><span>3.1. </span>Query Planning Decisions Can Be Deferred Until Runtime</h2>

<p>
When a prepared statement is bytecode, once the bytecode has been generated,
the algorithm is fixed - it is "baked in" - and becomes difficult to modify
as new information about the shape of the information being retrieved
becomes available.  This is not the case with a tree-of-objects prepared
statement.  A tree-of-objects is easier to modify on-the-fly.  The query
plan is mutable and can be tweaked as it is running, based on the progress
of the query.  Thus a query can be dynamically self-tuning.

</p><h2 id="dataflow_programs_are_easy_to_parallelize"><span>3.2. </span>Dataflow Programs Are Easy To Parallelize</h2>

<p>In a dataflow program, each processing node can be assigned to a
different thread.  There needs to be some kind of threadsafe queuing
mechanism for transferring intermediate results from one node to the
next.  But no synchronization primitives are typically needed within
each node of the program.  Node schedule is trivial:  A node becomes
eligible to run when it has data available and there is space in its
output queue.

</p><p>This is an important consideration for database engines that are
designed to run large analytic queries 
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_analytical_processing">OLAP</a>)
on large multi-core servers.
The primary focus of SQLite is transaction processing 
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_transaction_processing">OLTP</a>) 
on the internet-of-things, so there is less need to
represent prepared statements as dataflow programs in SQLite.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://typespec.io/blog/2024-04-25-introducing">https://typespec.io/blog/2024-04-25-introducing</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40206124">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="__blog-post-container"><p>Over last few years, we've been hard at work on <a href="https://typespec.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://typespec.io/</a>, a modern API definition language. This language is designed to meet the evolving needs of API developers, architects, and managers in an environment where the delivery of consistently high-quality APIs and related experiences is becoming increasingly complex and critical.</p>
<p>TypeSpec is more than just a new language; it's a platform that enables abstraction, encourages code reuse, and leverages modern tooling for rapid development. Meeting these needs requires a blend of innovative technology and fresh processes that place the API as the fundamental truth on which we build our sophisticated abstractions.</p>
<p>TypeSpec describes APIs using any protocol or serialization format with concise, familiar syntax and great editor tooling for Visual Studio and VS Code. It can encapsulate common data types, API patterns, and API guidelines into high level, reusable components that can be shared across teams or ecosystems. It can compile to standards compliant OpenAPI, JSON Schema, or Protobuf (or even all three at the same time).</p>
<p>We believe this new technology unlocks new ways for developers to build APIs and the applications around them in a more productive and higher quality way than in the past.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="hero" src="https://typespec.io/assets/images/hero-aa395aabbeb145076703d7bed45c8699.png" width="1205" height="643"></p>

<h3 id="interoperability">Interoperability<a href="#interoperability" aria-label="Direct link to Interoperability" title="Direct link to Interoperability">​</a></h3>
<p>TypeSpec is not just another API description language; it's a higher-level definition language capable of defining your API and then outputting many different protocols, clients, servers, documentation and more, even simultaneously. This makes it a versatile tool that can adapt to a variety of development scenarios.
Furthermore, TypeSpec is committed to being interoperable with industry standard API definition languages, bridging the gap between different choices.</p>
<h3 id="productivity">Productivity<a href="#productivity" aria-label="Direct link to Productivity" title="Direct link to Productivity">​</a></h3>
<p>TypeSpec provides a superior developer experience, making the process of defining data and APIs both enjoyable and productive. The language is concise and able to define complex data and API shapes with minimal typing.
Its tooling makes development and maintenance a breeze, surfacing errors and guideline violations at development time, long before any human review process gets involved.</p>
<h3 id="api-patterns">API Patterns<a href="#api-patterns" aria-label="Direct link to API Patterns" title="Direct link to API Patterns">​</a></h3>
<p>TypeSpec improves API quality by encapsulating common data types, API patterns, and API guidelines into high-level, reusable components that can be shared across teams or ecosystems.
This alignment of components with domain and business-specific concepts ensures that specs are written in a language everyone understands, rather than low-level protocol details.</p>
<h3 id="familiarity">Familiarity<a href="#familiarity" aria-label="Direct link to Familiarity" title="Direct link to Familiarity">​</a></h3>
<p>Inspired by TypeScript and C#, TypeSpec is easy to learn and feels familiar to many developers, reducing the learning curve.</p>
<h3 id="extensibility">Extensibility<a href="#extensibility" aria-label="Direct link to Extensibility" title="Direct link to Extensibility">​</a></h3>
<p>TypeSpec can be extended with custom decorator vocabularies and type templates, allowing you to model APIs in your business or application logic domain.
Its extensibility allows it to describe many different protocols, serialization formats, or domain-specific metadata, serving as a source-of-truth for anything API-related.</p>
<h3 id="ecosystem">Ecosystem<a href="#ecosystem" aria-label="Direct link to Ecosystem" title="Direct link to Ecosystem">​</a></h3>
<p>TypeSpec allows packaging of common types, language extensions, linters, and emitters into packages, which can be distributed on NPM within your organization or across the ecosystem.</p>
<h2 id="community-and-collaboration">Community and Collaboration<a href="#community-and-collaboration" aria-label="Direct link to Community and Collaboration" title="Direct link to Community and Collaboration">​</a></h2>
<h3 id="used-at-microsoft">Used at Microsoft<a href="#used-at-microsoft" aria-label="Direct link to Used at Microsoft" title="Direct link to Used at Microsoft">​</a></h3>
<p>At Microsoft, we believe in the value of using our own products, a practice often referred to as "dogfooding". This approach allows us to test and understand our products firsthand.
Many Azure services within Microsoft have already adopted TypeSpec, and the number is growing daily. This internal use of TypeSpec not only demonstrates its effectiveness but also provides us with valuable feedback for continuous improvement. By using TypeSpec in our own development processes, we ensure its reliability and efficiency for API development.
Harnessing the power of TypeSpec, the Microsoft Graph team has revolutionized API development within Microsoft. This collaboration has enhanced productivity and simplified customization, underscoring TypeSpec's potential.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In the Microsoft Graph team, we've been excited to partner with our colleagues building TypeSpec to create a productive and innovative environment for the engineers creating all the varied and rich APIs accessible through Microsoft Graph.
TypeSpec has provided us with an amazing platform to build terse and expressive API descriptions, and customizing the language to match Microsoft Graph's domain has been easy and fun."</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="join-us">Join Us<a href="#join-us" aria-label="Direct link to Join Us" title="Direct link to Join Us">​</a></h3>
<p>TypeSpec is more than just a language; it's a community. We believe in the power of collaboration, and that's why TypeSpec is open source. We invite developers from all backgrounds to join the public beta and experience the power of TypeSpec firsthand. Your feedback is invaluable in shaping the future of TypeSpec, and we encourage you to share your thoughts, suggestions, and bug reports on our community forums.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.fromjason.xyz/p/notebook/firechat-was-a-tool-for-revolution-then-it-disappeared/">https://www.fromjason.xyz/p/notebook/firechat-was-a-tool-for-revolution-then-it-disappeared/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40204516">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>   

<p>For years, FireChat helped people circumvent their internet gatekeepers— the authoritarian governments and spineless corporations that control our every move through a network of proprietary data centers and deep-sea cables.</p>
<p>In Iran, forty thousand people downloaded the app when their government blocked internet access. Over one hundred thousand protesters in Hong Kong used the app to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/29/firechat-messaging-app-powering-hong-kong-protests">coordinate their resistance</a> against Chinese authority. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbrella_Movement">Singaporeans</a>, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/firechat-comes-to-uoh-students-rescue/articleshow/50691376.cms">Indians</a>, <a href="https://globalvoices.org/2015/06/28/the-internet-a-staging-post-for-protests-in-ecuador-is-under-threat/">Ecuadorians</a>, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-12-30/russians-are-organizing-against-putin-using-firechat-messaging-app">Russians</a>, and seemingly every pro-democracy movement globally took advantage of the off-grid messaging app.</p>
<p>What made FireChat an effective tool for revolution was its ability to bypass the centralized and often monopolized Internet Service Providers. Launched in 2011 by Open Garden, FireChat allowed people to communicate without an Internet connection. The mobile app cleverly leveraged Bluetooth and WiFi signals already emitting from our phones to create peer-to-peer connections known as a mesh network.</p>
<p>In 2014, after Hong Kong protesters demonstrated to the world how effective a tool it was, news blogs quickly pointed out that FireChat messages were not secure. By 2015, Open Garden updated the app to include end-to-end encryption, a feature that many modern messaging apps still lack today.</p>
<p>In 2015, Wired <a href="https://archive.ph/sUPif">called FireChat</a> a "Giant Network of Free Messaging.” Indeed, but it was so much more. The mesh network enabled by FireChat was a new internet by the people, literally. The larger the crowd, the better the technology worked, as messages would "bounce” from phone to phone until they reached their recipient.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jun/24/firechat-updates-as-40000-iraqis-download-mesh-chat-app-to-get-online-in-censored-baghdad">Firechat updates as 40,000 Iraqis download 'mesh' chat app in censored Baghdad</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Your phone today, your smartphone, not only has a radio to connect to a cell tower, but it also has other radios, like WiFi or Bluetooth, to connect to other devices around," explains OpenGarden co-founder Micha Benoliel. "And when smartphones are next to each other with Firechat, they directly interconnect."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The technology worked so well that Open Garden then released <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/5/19/11711686/firechat-alerts-app-natural-disaster-mesh-network">FireChat Alerts</a>, allowing rescue workers to send offline messages during emergencies.</p>
<p>Mind you, all of this was happening off-grid, without mega corporations mining our data or governments spying through corporate-sanctioned back doors.</p>
<p>Then, one day in February 2020, as COVID-19 swept the globe, access to FireChat was completely cut off without explanation. Four months later, a police officer murdered a Black man in Minnesota, resulting in protests across the United States.</p>
<p>Those protests sparked a roaring fire of consciousness over ￼this country's injustices. But no one on the ground fighting for our rights has been able to use the people's internet that never was.</p>
<p>Today, if you go to the official FireChat website, you're greeted hostilely with a message that your IP address has been blocked for suspicious activity. The Internet Archive view of the site shows the same message, so don't feel too bad. The Open Garden website shows a similar, though admittedly less hostile-feeling 403 Forbidden error.</p>
<p>No acquisition announcement for FireChat can be found. No teary-eyed "it's been an incredible journey” open letter by its founders was ever published. FireChat, and then later its parent company Open Garden, closed for business without any acknowledgment.</p>
<p>Without any information, it's hard to say why FireChat disappeared. If pressed about it, someone somewhere has a carefully constructed story with a plausible explanation, I'm sure. However, by all accounts, FireChat's mesh network technology was greater than the sum of its users. It was freedom from a ruthlessly for-profit internet that has increasingly become more centralized and monopolistic. And the fact that no one seems to have anything to say about this once darling of Silicon Valley tells us all we need to know.</p>
<p>FireChat is gone because FireChat was a threat to the systems it circumvented.</p>

<p>The Federal Communications Commission today said it fined T-Mobile, AT&amp;T, and Verizon $196 million "for illegally sharing access to customers' location information without consent and without taking reasonable measures to protect that information against unauthorized disclosure."</p>
<p>The fines relate to sharing of real-time location data that was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/06/verizon-and-att-will-stop-selling-your-phones-location-to-data-brokers/">revealed in 2018</a>. The FCC <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/02/fcc-issues-wrist-slap-fines-to-carriers-that-sold-your-phone-location-data/">proposed the fines</a> in 2020, when the commission had a Republican majority, and finalized them today.</p>
<p>All three major carriers vowed to appeal the fines after they were announced today. The three carriers also said they discontinued the data-sharing programs that the fines relate to.</p>
<p>The fines are $80.1 million for T-Mobile, $57.3 million for AT&amp;T, and $46.9 million for Verizon. T-Mobile is also on the hook for a $12.2 million fine issued to Sprint, which was bought by T-Mobile shortly after the penalties were proposed over four years ago.</p>
<p>Today, the FCC <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-fines-largest-wireless-carriers-sharing-location-data">summarized its findings</a> as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>The FCC Enforcement Bureau investigations of the four carriers found that each carrier sold access to its customers' location information to "aggregators," who then resold access to such information to third-party location-based service providers. In doing so, each carrier attempted to offload its obligations to obtain customer consent onto downstream recipients of location information, which in many instances meant that no valid customer consent was obtained. This initial failure was compounded when, after becoming aware that their safeguards were ineffective, the carriers continued to sell access to location information without taking reasonable measures to protect it from unauthorized access.</p></blockquote>
<h2>“Shady actors” got hold of data</h2>
<p>The problem first came to light with reports of customer location data "being disclosed by the largest American wireless carriers without customer consent or other legal authorization to a Missouri Sheriff through a 'location-finding service' operated by Securus, a provider of communications services to correctional facilities, to track the location of numerous individuals," the FCC said.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/FCC-24-41A2.pdf">said</a> that news reports in 2018 "revealed that the largest wireless carriers in the country were selling our real-time location information to data aggregators, allowing this highly sensitive data to wind up in the hands of bail-bond companies, bounty hunters, and other shady actors. This ugly practice violates the law—specifically Section 222 of the Communications Act, which protects the privacy of consumer data."</p>
<p>For a time after the 2018 reports, "all four carriers continued to operate their programs without putting in place reasonable safeguards to ensure that the dozens of location-based service providers with access to their customers' location information were actually obtaining customer consent," the FCC said.</p>
<p>The three carriers are ready to challenge the fines in court. "This industry-wide third-party aggregator location-based services program was discontinued more than five years ago after we took steps to ensure that critical services like roadside assistance, fraud protection and emergency response would not be disrupted," T-Mobile said in a statement provided to Ars. "We take our responsibility to keep customer data secure very seriously and have always supported the FCC's commitment to protecting consumers, but this decision is wrong, and the fine is excessive. We intend to challenge it."</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p id="559d">A few weeks ago, I began working on the PoC of a document indexing system for my client. I created a single S3 bucket in the <em>eu-west-1</em> region and uploaded some files there for testing. Two days later, I checked my AWS billing page, primarily to make sure that what I was doing was well within the free-tier limits. Apparently, it wasn’t. My bill was over <em>1300$</em>, with the billing console showing nearly <em>100,000,000 S3 PUT requests</em> executed within just one day!</p><figure><figcaption>My billed S3 usage per day, per region</figcaption></figure><h2 id="2e9e">Where were these requests coming from?</h2><p id="b20a">By default, AWS doesn’t log requests executed against your S3 buckets. However, such logs can be enabled using <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-logging.html" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">AWS CloudTrail</a> or <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/ServerLogs.html" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">S3 Server Access Logging</a>. After enabling CloudTrail logs, I immediately observed thousands of write requests originating from multiple accounts.</p><h2 id="f863">But why would some third party accounts bombard my S3 bucket with unauthorised requests?</h2><p id="6c13">Was it some kind of DDoS-like attack against my account? Against AWS? As it turns out, <strong>one of the popular open-source tools had a default configuration to store their backups in S3. And, as a placeholder for a bucket name, they used… the same name that I used for my bucket</strong>. This meant that every deployment of this tool with default configuration values attempted to store its backups in my S3 bucket!</p><blockquote><p id="3e1a">Note: Unfortunately, I can’t disclose the name of the tool I’m referring to, as doing so would put the impacted companies at risk (as explained further).</p></blockquote><p id="22c7">So, a horde of unauthorized third parties is attempting to store their data in my private S3 bucket. But why should I be the one paying for this mistake? Here’s why:</p><h2 id="2a1a">S3 charges you for unauthorized incoming requests</h2><p id="e936">This was confirmed in my exchange with AWS support. As they wrote:</p><blockquote><p id="4e27">Yes, S3 charges for unauthorized requests (4xx) as well[1]. That’s expected behavior.</p></blockquote><p id="1a90">So, if I were to open my terminal now and type:</p><pre><span id="8e15">aws s3 cp ./file.txt s3://your-bucket-name/random_key</span></pre><p id="c977">I would receive an <em>AccessDenied</em> error, but you would be the one to pay for that request.</p><p id="47dc">Another question was bugging me: why was over half of my bill coming from the <em>us-east-1</em> region? I didn’t have a single bucket there! The answer to that is that the S3 requests without a specified region default to <em>us-east-1 </em>and are redirected as needed. And you pay extra for that redirected request.</p><h2 id="aec7">The security aspect</h2><p id="111c">We now understand why my S3 bucket was bombarded with millions of requests and why I ended up with a huge S3 bill. At that point, I had one more idea I wanted to explore. If all those misconfigured systems were attempting to back up their data into my S3 bucket, what if I opened it for public writes? I made my bucket public for less than 30 seconds, and within that timeframe, collected over 10GB of data. Of course, I can’t disclose whose data it was. But it left me amazed at how an innocent configuration oversight could lead to a dangerous data leak!</p><h2 id="9b8c">What did I learn from all this?</h2><h2 id="c083">Lesson 1: Anyone who knows the name of any of your S3 buckets can ramp up your AWS bill as they like.</h2><p id="de0d">Other than deleting the bucket, there’s nothing you can do to prevent it. You can’t protect your bucket with services like CloudFront or WAF when it’s being accessed directly through the S3 API. Standard S3 PUT requests are priced at just <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">$0.005 per 1,000 requests</a>, but a single machine can easily execute thousands of such requests per second.</p><h2 id="3484">Lesson 2: Adding a random suffix to your bucket names can enhance security.</h2><p id="86a0">This practice reduces vulnerability to misconfigured systems or intentional attacks. At least avoid using short and common names for your S3 buckets.</p><h2 id="2a08">Lesson 3: When executing a lot of requests to S3, make sure to explicitly specify the AWS region.</h2><p id="e077">This way you will avoid additional costs of S3 API redirects.</p><h2 id="7c33">Aftermath:</h2><ol><li id="3214">I reported my findings to the maintainers of the vulnerable open-source tool. They promptly fixed the default configuration, although they can’t fix the existing deployments.</li><li id="ecbe">Additionally, I notified the AWS security team. I hoped they might restrict the unfortunate S3 bucket name, but they were unwilling to address misconfigurations of third-party products.</li><li id="b42a">I reported the issue to two companies whose data I found in my bucket. They did not respond to my emails, possibly considering them as spam.</li><li id="87dd">AWS was kind enough to cancel my S3 bill. However, they emphasized that this was done as an exception.</li></ol><p id="90a4">Thank you for taking the time to read my post. I hope it will help you steer clear of unexpected AWS charges!</p></div></div>]]></description>

These interfaces operate like slot machines at a casino, providing a dopamine boost every few seconds. The goal is to keep users’ eyes glued to their screens—thus maximizing advertising revenues. </p><p>The leader in this movement is TikTok. But the other major platforms (Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, etc.) are imitating its fast-paced video reels. </p><p>My articles have stirred up discussion and debate—especially about the impact of slot machine-ish social media platforms on youngsters. </p><p>So I decided to dig into the available data on children and social media. And it was even worse than I feared. </p><p>The story gets worse. The numbers are rising rapidly—usage among this vulnerable group jumped 5% in just one year. </p><p>By the way, almost a quarter of children in this demographic have a smartphone. More than three-quarters use a tablet computer.</p><p>These figures come from Ofcom, a UK-based regulatory group. I’ll let you decide how applicable they are to other countries. My hunch is that the situation in the US is even worse, but that’s just an educated guess based on having lived in both countries. </p><p>One thing is certain—the mental health of youths in both the US and UK is deteriorating rapidly. There are dozens of ways of measuring the crisis, but they all tell the same tragic story.</p><p>Something happened around 2010, and it’s destroying millions of lives. </p><p>Now let’s look at the timeline for global smartphone usage. This also accelerated around 2010.</p><p><span>Apologists for TikTok will tell you that these mental health problems are merely </span><em>correlated</em><span> with excessive screen time and that does not prove causation. Well, yes, of course, but…I will simply ask you to judge the plausibility of that defense based on your own common sense observations and life experiences. </span></p><p>Their defense would be more plausible if youngsters were spending only a small portion of their day online. So let’s look at more data on how they allocate their time. </p><p>Here’s a comparison of time spent online by age. Even before they reach their teens, youngsters are spending more than four hours per day staring into a screen.</p><p>Here’s what a day in the digital life of a typical 9-year-old girl looks like.</p><p>I don’t find any of this amusing. But if you’re looking for dark humor, I’ll point to the four minutes spent on the Duolingo language training app at the end of the day. This provides an indicator of the relative role of learning in the digital regimen on the rising generation.</p><p>Now let’s look at even younger children. Here’s a glimpse at the digital life of a child aged 5 through 7. </p><p>The role of digital media increases dramatically between ages 8 and 12.</p><p>By the way, more than 20% of underage users have an adult profile which allows them to access all content on these platforms. </p><p>What could possibly go wrong?</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.honest-broker.com/p/i-ask-seven-heretical-questions-about" rel="">I Ask Seven Heretical Questions About Progress</a></strong></p><p><strong><a href="https://www.honest-broker.com/p/where-did-tiktok-come-from" rel="">Where Did TikTok Come From?</a></strong></p><p><strong><a href="https://www.honest-broker.com/p/the-state-of-the-culture-2024" rel="">The State of the Culture, 2024</a></strong></p><p><strong><a href="https://www.honest-broker.com/p/i-receive-a-letter-from-a-high-school" rel="">I Receive a Letter from a High School Student</a></strong></p><p><strong><a href="https://www.honest-broker.com/p/notes-toward-a-new-romanticism" rel="">Notes Toward a New Romanticism</a></strong></p><p><strong><a href="https://www.honest-broker.com/p/13-observations-on-ritual" rel="">Thirteen Observations on Ritual</a></strong></p><p><strong><a href="https://www.honest-broker.com/p/how-to-break-free-from-dopamine-culture" rel="">How to Break Free from Dopamine Culture</a></strong></p><p><span>Skeptics can pretend this is </span><em>all quite normal</em><span>. But, judging by the feedback I’m getting, the vast majority of adults have already lost trust in the technocracy. They are deeply troubled by what the dominant platforms are doing to society, especially vulnerable children. </span></p><p>They know that a terrible crisis is underway, and blame tech leaders and their apologists—who are destroying the next generation in pursuit of profits.</p><p><span>We’ve seen it before. There was a time when tobacco companies denied that smoking caused cancer. (Their argument—that </span><a href="https://builtin.com/articles/correlation-causation" rel="">correlation does not prove causation</a><span>—will sound familiar.)</span></p><p><span>That was too bad for all the people who died because of that smokescreen argument (literally and figuratively). There was also a time when corporations—</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:16-p-1402-2_Fire_Ants_on_Trial.webm" rel="">and the US government!</a><span>—issued propaganda to support the use of DDT and other dangerous pesticides. We’ve seen the same narrative spinning in so many other business: </span><a href="https://harvardlawreview.org/print/vol-131/haskins-v-3m-co/" rel="">asbestos</a><span>, </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsafe_at_Any_Speed:_The_Designed-In_Dangers_of_the_American_Automobile" rel="">automobiles</a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/379/bmj.o2688" rel="">opioids</a><span>, etc. </span></p><p>But you should always follow the money. </p><p><span>Academics who defended smoking took </span><em>big cash</em><span> from Big Tobacco. You should check out </span><a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2012/09/02/cigarettes/" rel="">how much tobacco money went to distinguished statisticians back then</a><span>—who would ever have guessed that these STEM academics could be corrupted by cash? </span></p><p>I believe we are at a similar juncture right now. </p><p>We will eventually have access to peer-reviewed, longitudinal studies with tightly defined control groups. Along the way, statisticians getting funded by tech, and their fellow travelers, will try to obfuscate as much as they can. But wise parents—who live in the real world, not academia—are already taking prudent steps. </p><p>That’s what parenting is all about. </p><p><span>It would be nice if the government and tech billionaires (now </span><a href="https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2024/04/26/who-will-buy-tiktok-will-bytedance-sell/" rel="">lining up to buy TikTok</a><span>) helped them out. But since so much money is at stake, parents will probably have to fight this battle on their own. </span></p><p>The rest of us should support them as best we can. A good starting point is to speak honestly and forthrightly about what tech is actually doing in our communities. I’ll certainly be writing more about this in the future. </p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

            A lost lawsuit, a flimsy appeal, and misleading public statements... things aren't looking good for the Internet's archivist.        </p><div>
        <p>On April 19th, The Internet Archive filed the final brief in their appeal of the "<a href="https://lunduke.locals.com/post/5016077/the-internet-archives-digital-lending-puts-the-entire-service-at-risk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hachette v. Internet Archive</a>" lawsuit (for which, judgment was <a href="https://lunduke.locals.com/post/5016077/the-internet-archives-digital-lending-puts-the-entire-service-at-risk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">handed down, against Internet Archive</a>, last year).</p><p>What is curious, is that this final brief fails -- <em>almost completely</em> -- to reasonably address the core issues of the lawsuit.&nbsp; What's more, the public statements that followed, by The Internet Archive, appeared to be crafted to drum up public sympathy by misrepresenting the core of the case itself.</p><p>Which suggests that The Internet Archive is very much aware that they are likely to lose this appeal.</p><p>After a careful reading of the existing public documents relating to this case... it truly is difficult to come to any other conclusion.</p><p><a href="https://archive.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Internet Archive</a> does some critically important work by archiving, and indexing, a wide variety of culturally significant material (from webpages to decades old magazine articles).&nbsp; In this work, they help to preserve history.&nbsp; A extremely noble, and valuable, endeavor.&nbsp; Which makes the likelihood of this legal defeat all the more unfortunate.</p><h3>What is "Hachette v. Internet Archive"?&nbsp;</h3><p>Here's the short-<em>short</em> version of this lawsuit:</p><p>The Internet Archive created a program they called "Controlled Digital Lending" (CDL) -- where a physical book is scanned, turned into a digital file, and that digital file is then "loaned" out to people on the Internet.&nbsp; In 2020, The Internet Archive removed what few restrictions existed with this Digital Lending program, allowing an <em>unlimited</em> number of people to download the digital copy of a book.</p><p>The result was a group of publishers filing the "<a href="https://lunduke.locals.com/post/5016077/the-internet-archives-digital-lending-puts-the-entire-service-at-risk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hachette v. Internet Archive</a>" lawsuit.&nbsp; That lawsuit focused on two key complaints:</p><ol><li>The books were "digitized" (converted from physical to digital form) -- <em>and distributed</em> -- without the permission of the copyright holders (publishers, authors, etc.).</li><li>The Internet Archive received monetary donations (and other monetary rewards) as a result of freely distributing said copyrighted material.&nbsp; Again, without permission of the copyright holders.&nbsp; Effectively making the Internet Archive's CDL a commercial enterprise for the distribution of what is best described as "pirated material".</li></ol><p>That lawsuit was decided, against The Internet Archive, in 2023 -- with the judge declaring that "no case or legal principle supports" their defense of "Fair Use".</p><p>That judgment was appealed by The Internet Archive.&nbsp; Which brings us to today, and thier final defense (in theory).</p><h3>What is the final defense of The Internet Archive?</h3><p>Let's take a look at the final brief in The Internet Archive's bid to appeal this ruling.</p><figure><img src="https://media3.locals.com/images/posts/2024-04-24/102127/102127_jhk5au92b4ux1ga_custom.jpeg" alt="" width="482" height="245"><figcaption>In true Internet Archive form, a PDF of the final brief in their appeal <a href="https://archive.org/details/2024-04-19-reply-brief-hachette-v-internet-archive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has been posted to Archive.org</a>.</figcaption></figure><p>The general defense of The Internet Archive is fairly simple: The Internet Archive's "Controlled Digital Lending" falls under "Fair Use".&nbsp; And, therefor, is legal.</p><p>Let's look at two of the key arguments within the brief... and the issues with them.</p><h3>Not "For Anyone to Read"</h3><blockquote><p>"Controlled digital lending is not equivalent to posting an ebook online for anyone to read"</p></blockquote><p>This argument -- part of the brief's Introduction -- is quite a strange defense to make.</p><p>The "Controlled Digital Lending" program, starting in <a href="https://lunduke.locals.com/post/5016077/the-internet-archives-digital-lending-puts-the-entire-service-at-risk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">March of 2020</a>, <em>literally</em> posted a massive book archive "online for anyone to read".&nbsp; This was branded the "National Emergency Library".</p><p><img src="https://media3.locals.com/images/posts/2024-04-24/102127/102127_slrtcs267a4u3or_custom.jpeg" alt="">Good intentions aside, the Internet Archive is now attempting to claim that they did <em>not do</em>... the exact thing that <em>they proudly did</em> (they even <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2020/03/24/announcing-a-national-emergency-library-to-provide-digitized-books-to-students-and-the-public" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">issued press releases about how they did it</a>).</p><p>As such, I don't see a judge being swayed by this (poorly thought out) argument.</p><h3>"Because of the Huge Investment"</h3><blockquote><p>"... because of the huge investment required to operate a legally compliant controlled lending system and the controls defining the practice, finding fair use here would not trigger any of the doomsday consequences for rightsholders that Publishers and their amici claim to fear."</p></blockquote><p>Did you follow that?</p><p>The argument here is roughly as follows:</p><p>"It costs a lot of money to make, and distribute, digital copies of books without the permission of the copyright holder...&nbsp; therefore it should be legal for The Internet Archive to do it."</p><p>An absolutely <em>fascinating</em> defense.&nbsp; "Someone else might not be able to commit this crime, so we should be allowed to do it" is one of the <em>weirdest</em> defences I have ever heard.</p><p>Again, I doubt the judge in this case is likely to be convinced by this logic.</p><p>There are <em>many</em> other arguments made within this final brief -- in total, <a href="https://archive.org/details/2024-04-19-reply-brief-hachette-v-internet-archive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">32 pages worth of arguments</a>.&nbsp; But none were any more convincing -- from a logical perspective -- than the two presented here.&nbsp; In fact, most of the arguments tended to be entirely <em>unrelated</em> to the core lawsuit and judgment.</p><h3>The Court of Public Opinion</h3><p>Let's be honest: The Internet Archive looks destined to lose this court battle.&nbsp; They lost once, and their appeal is, to put it mildly, weak.</p><p>Maybe you and I are on the side of The Internet Archive.&nbsp; Maybe we are such big fans of Archive.org that we <em>want</em> to come to their defense.</p><p>But feelings don't matter here.&nbsp; Only facts.&nbsp; And the facts are simple.&nbsp; The Archive's actions and statements (and questionable legal defense) have all but ensured a loss in this case.</p><p>So... what happens next?</p><p>What do you do when you have a profitable enterprise (bringing in <a href="https://lunduke.locals.com/post/5016077/the-internet-archives-digital-lending-puts-the-entire-service-at-risk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">between $20 and $30 million per year</a>) that is on the verge of a potentially devastating legal ruling which could put you out of business?</p><p>Why, you turn to the court of public opinion, of course!</p><p>And you spin.&nbsp; Spin, spin, spin.&nbsp; Spin like the wind!</p><p><a href="https://blog.archive.org/2024/04/19/internet-archive-stands-firm-on-library-digital-rights-in-final-brief-of-hachette-v-internet-archive-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Here is a statement from Brewster Kahle</a>, founder of The Internet Archive", who is working to frame this as a fight for the rights of Libraries:</p><blockquote><p>"Resolving this should be easy—just sell ebooks to libraries so we can own, preserve and lend them to one person at a time. This is a battle for the soul of libraries in the digital age."</p></blockquote><p>A battle for the soul of libraries!&nbsp; <em>Woah!</em>&nbsp; The <strong><em>soul</em></strong>?!</p><p>That's an intense statement -- clearly crafted to elicit an emotional response.&nbsp; To whip people up.</p><p>But take another look at the rest of that statement.&nbsp; The Internet Archive founder says that resolving this case "should be easy".&nbsp; And he provides a simple, easy-to-follow solution:</p><blockquote><p>"just sell ebooks to libraries so we can own, preserve and lend them to one person at a time"</p></blockquote><p>Go ahead.&nbsp; Read that again.&nbsp; At first it makes total sense... until you realize that it has almost <em>nothing</em> to do with this specific case.</p><p>Let's ignore the "one person at a time" statement, which is a well established lie (the Internet Archive proudly distributed digital copies of physical books to anyone who wanted them, not "one at a time").</p><p>But take a look at this proposed resolution... note that it has <em>very</em> little to do with the actual case.&nbsp; The case is about the digitizing of physical books, and distributing those digital copies without permission of the copyright holder.&nbsp; This proposed resolution is about... <em>selling</em> eBooks to lenders.</p><p>Yes.&nbsp; Both have to do with eBooks.&nbsp; And, <em>yes</em>, both have to do with <em>lending</em> eBooks.</p><p>But that is where the similarities end.&nbsp; And the differences, in this case, are absolutely critical.</p><p>Let's take a look at the <em>actual</em> ruling -- which The Internet Archive is attempting to appeal:</p><blockquote><p>"At bottom, [the Internet Archive’s] fair use defense rests on the notion that lawfully <strong>acquiring a copyrighted print book entitles the recipient to make an unauthorized copy and distribute it in place of the print book</strong>, so long as it does not simultaneously lend the print book.&nbsp; But no case or legal principle supports that notion. Every authority points the other direction."</p></blockquote><p>The Internet Archive's publicly proposed resolution does not address this ruling <em>at all</em>.&nbsp; Which means that, when talking to the public, The Internet Archive is being dishonest about this case.</p><p>But they are using flowery language -- "<em>battle for the soul of libraries</em>" -- so they'll likely manage to convince many people that they're telling the truth and representing the facts of the case fairly and honestly.&nbsp; Even if they are not.</p><h3>There Are Important Disagreements Here</h3><p>None of which is to say that the points which The Internet Archive is making... are necessarily wrong.</p><p>From <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2024/04/19/internet-archive-stands-firm-on-library-digital-rights-in-final-brief-of-hachette-v-internet-archive-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the announcement of their appeal</a>, the Archive states the following:</p><blockquote><p>"By restricting libraries’ ability to lend the books they own digitally, the publishers’ license-only business model and litigation strategies perpetuate inequality in access to knowledge."</p></blockquote><p>While this statement is designed to evoke specific feelings and responses -- among specific political demographics (see: "perpetuate inequality") -- there is an underlying set of issues here that are worth thinking about.</p><ul><li>Is it important that libraries be able to lend <em>official</em> digital editions of books?</li><li>Should publishers, authors, and other copyright holders be forced to supply digital versions of their written works to libraries?</li><li>If digital works, borrowed from a library, are then copied and distributed more than the rights allow... who is ultimately responsible for that?&nbsp; The library?&nbsp; The creator of the software system which facilitated the lending?&nbsp; Nobody at all?</li><li>Should Libraries or Publishers be able to censor or modify digital works... or should a published digital work be maintained as it is at time of publication?&nbsp; (This issue comes up a lot when talking about censorship and revisions of works.)</li></ul><p>These are legitimate questions.&nbsp; And, while the answers may appear obvious, there truly are distinct disagreements among publishers, authors, and libraries.</p><p>Some of these issues are raised by The Internet Archive, <a href="https://www.battleforlibraries.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BattleForLibraries.com</a>, and others.</p><figure><img src="https://media3.locals.com/images/posts/2024-04-24/102127/102127_bakgi2yt42vpxmo_custom.jpeg" alt="" width="453" height="251"><figcaption>The "<a href="https://www.battleforlibraries.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battle for Libraries</a>" campaign</figcaption></figure><p>But none of these questions -- <em>not one</em> -- are part of the ruling in "<a href="https://lunduke.locals.com/post/5016077/the-internet-archives-digital-lending-puts-the-entire-service-at-risk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hachette v. Internet Archive</a>".</p><p>The question that has been answered in this case is simply:</p><ul><li>If you buy physical media (such as a book), can that media be digitized and distributed on the Internet (without authorization or notification of the copyright owner)?</li></ul><p>And the answer is, thus far, a resounding... "<em><strong>No</strong></em>".</p><h3>The Can of Worms</h3><p>What happens if the judge chooses to uphold the existing judgment against The Internet Archive?</p><p>A number of things seems possible (with some seeming like a downright certainty).</p><ul><li>Publishers, authors, and copyright holders of works distributed by The Internet Archive may choose to seek damages.&nbsp; Which could put The Internet Archive in a precarious financial position (to say the least).</li><li>The Internet Archive may be forced to remove other content of questionable copyright.&nbsp; Including software, video, and audio archives.</li><li>Other archival projects may now come under increased scrutiny... thus making it riskier to archive and distribute various types of material.</li><li>And, of course, The Internet Archive could attempt to appeal the case ever higher.&nbsp; Which may be tricky.</li></ul><p>Then again... The Internet Archive could win this appeal.</p><p>Unlikely.&nbsp; But, hey, weirder things have happened.</p><div>

<div><p>We’re redefining the developer environment with GitHub Copilot Workspace–where any developer can go from idea, to code, to software in natural language. <a href="https://githubnext.com/projects/copilot-workspace">Sign up here</a>. </p></div>
<p>In the past two years, generative AI has foundationally changed the developer landscape largely as a tool embedded inside the developer environment. In 2022, we launched GitHub Copilot as an autocomplete pair programmer in the editor, <a href="https://github.blog/2022-09-07-research-quantifying-github-copilots-impact-on-developer-productivity-and-happiness/">boosting developer productivity by up to 55%</a>. Copilot is now the most widely adopted AI developer tool. In 2023, we released GitHub Copilot Chat—unlocking the power of natural language in coding, debugging, and testing—allowing developers to converse with their code in real time.</p>
<p>After sharing <a href="https://github.blog/2023-11-08-universe-2023-copilot-transforms-github-into-the-ai-powered-developer-platform/">an early glimpse</a> at GitHub Universe last year, today, we are reimagining the nature of the developer experience itself with the technical preview of GitHub Copilot Workspace: the Copilot-native developer environment. Within Copilot Workspace, developers can now brainstorm, plan, build, test, and run code in natural language. This new task-centric experience leverages different Copilot-powered agents from start to finish, while giving developers full control over every step of the process.</p>
<p>

		</p>
<p>Copilot Workspace represents a radically new way of building software with natural language, and is expressly <a href="https://github.blog/2024-01-17-a-developers-second-brain-reducing-complexity-through-partnership-with-ai/">designed</a> to deliver–not replace–developer creativity, faster and easier than ever before. With Copilot Workspace we will empower more experienced developers to operate as systems thinkers, and materially lower the barrier of entry for who can build software.</p>
<p>Welcome to the first day of a new developer environment. Here’s how it works:</p>
<h3 id="it-all-starts-with-the-task">It all starts with the task…<a href="#it-all-starts-with-the-task" aria-label="It all starts with the task…"></a></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/octoacademy-projects.png?w=1024&amp;resize=1024%2C593" alt="It starts with a task. Open GitHub Copilot Workspace from a GitHub Issue, Pull Request, or Repository. (Screenshot of an issue in the octoacademy repository.)" width="1024" height="593" loading="lazy" srcset="https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/octoacademy-projects.png?w=1600 1600w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/octoacademy-projects.png?w=300 300w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/octoacademy-projects.png?w=768 768w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/octoacademy-projects.png?w=1024&amp;resize=1024%2C593 1024w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/octoacademy-projects.png?w=1536 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>For developers, the greatest barrier to entry is almost always at the <a href="https://github.blog/2023-11-08-universe-2023-copilot-transforms-github-into-the-ai-powered-developer-platform/">beginning</a>. Think of how often you hit a wall in the first steps of a big project, feature request, or even bug report, simply because you don’t know how to get started. GitHub Copilot Workspace meets developers right at the origin: a GitHub Repository or a GitHub Issue. By leveraging Copilot agents as a second brain, developers will have AI assistance from the very beginning of an idea.</p>
<h3 id="workspace-builds-the-full-plan">…Workspace builds the full plan<a href="#workspace-builds-the-full-plan" aria-label="…Workspace builds the full plan"></a></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/3-Plan-of-Action-Zoom-with-BG.png?w=1024&amp;resize=1024%2C607" alt="Progress from your task to a specification, outlining what you want to achieve with Copilot Workspace.

<p>From there, Copilot Workspace offers a step-by-step plan to solve the issue based on its deep understanding of the codebase, issue replies, and more. It gives you everything you need to validate the plan, and test the code, in one streamlined list in natural language.</p>
<h3 id="and-its-entirely-editable">And it’s entirely editable…<a href="#and-its-entirely-editable" aria-label="And it’s entirely editable…"></a></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/copilot-workspace.png?w=1024&amp;resize=1024%2C593" alt="Then adjust your plan of action, adding steps, and general notes. Once the plan is implemented, you can view changes with a PR diff view and make edits as needed." width="1024" height="593" loading="lazy" srcset="https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/copilot-workspace.png?w=1600 1600w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/copilot-workspace.png?w=300 300w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/copilot-workspace.png?w=768 768w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/copilot-workspace.png?w=1024&amp;resize=1024%2C593 1024w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/copilot-workspace.png?w=1536 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>Everything that GitHub Copilot Workspace proposes—from the plan to the code—is fully editable, allowing you to iterate until you’re confident in the path ahead. You retain all of the autonomy, while Copilot Workspace lifts your cognitive strain.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/4.1-Run-code-in-Copilot-Workspace-v3.png?w=1024&amp;resize=1024%2C604" alt="Once you're happy with the code, you can use the integrated terminal to run unit tests, builds and appropriate checks." width="1024" height="604" loading="lazy" srcset="https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/4.1-Run-code-in-Copilot-Workspace-v3.png?w=3660 3660w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/4.1-Run-code-in-Copilot-Workspace-v3.png?w=300 300w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/4.1-Run-code-in-Copilot-Workspace-v3.png?w=768 768w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/4.1-Run-code-in-Copilot-Workspace-v3.png?w=1024&amp;resize=1024%2C604 1024w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/4.1-Run-code-in-Copilot-Workspace-v3.png?w=1536 1536w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/4.1-Run-code-in-Copilot-Workspace-v3.png?w=2048 2048w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/4.1-Run-code-in-Copilot-Workspace-v3.png?w=3000 3000w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>And once you’re satisfied with the plan, you can run your code directly in Copilot Workspace, jump into the underlying GitHub Codespace, and tweak all code changes until you are happy with the final result. You can also instantly share a workspace with your team via a link, so they can view your work and even try out their own iterations.</p>
<p>All that’s left then is to file your pull request, run your GitHub Actions, security code scanning, and ask your team members for human code review. And best of all, they can leverage your Copilot Workspace to see how you got from idea to code.</p>

<p>And because ideas can happen anywhere, GitHub Copilot Workspace was designed to be used from any device—empowering a real-world development environment that can work on a desktop, laptop, or on the go.</p>

<p>This is our mark on the future of the development environment: an intuitive, Copilot-powered infrastructure that makes it easier to get started, to learn, and ultimately to execute.</p>
<h2 id="enabling-a-world-with-1b-developers">Enabling a world with 1B developers<a href="#enabling-a-world-with-1b-developers" aria-label="Enabling a world with 1B developers"></a></h2>
<p>Early last year, GitHub celebrated over <a href="https://github.blog/2023-01-25-100-million-developers-and-counting/">100 million developers</a> on our platform—and counting. As programming in natural language lowers the barrier of entry to who can build software, we are accelerating to a near future where <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/the-next-billion-developers-perspective/">one billion people</a> on GitHub will control a machine just as easily as they ride a bicycle. We’ve constructed GitHub Copilot Workspace in pursuit of this horizon, as a conduit to help extend the economic opportunity and joy of building software to every human on the planet.</p>
<p>At the same time, we live in a world dependent on—and in short supply of—professional developers. Around the world, developers add millions of lines of code every single day to evermore complex systems and are increasingly behind on maintaining the old ones. Just like any infrastructure in this world, we need real experts to maintain and renew the world’s code. By quantifiably reducing boilerplate work, we will empower professional developers to increasingly operate as systems thinkers. We believe the step change in productivity gains that professional developers will experience by virtue of Copilot and now Copilot Workspace will only continue to <a href="https://github.blog/2023-06-27-the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/">increase labor demand</a>.</p>
<p>That’s the dual potential of GitHub Copilot: for the professional and hobbyist developer alike, channeling creativity into code just got a whole lot easier.</p>
<p><strong>Today, we begin the technical preview for GitHub Copilot Workspace.</strong><br> <a href="https://githubnext.com/projects/copilot-workspace">Sign up now</a>. <br> We can’t wait to see what you will build from here.</p>

He’s a big fan of power. That is power for certain people—i.e., people like him. Rich people, in other words. I used to consider Andreessen to be something of a buffoon—a guy who has been so rich for so long that it’s effectively addled his brain. His love of investing <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://fortune.com/2023/07/13/adam-neumann-why-marc-andreessen-invested-flow-wework/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://fortune.com/2023/07/13/adam-neumann-why-marc-andreessen-invested-flow-wework/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in  bad ideas</a></span> had me convinced of this. Now, however, I think a more apt descriptor might be “maniac.” He seems like a zealous believer in anything that helps sustain or enhance the American elite’s power accumulation, all other considerations be damned. </p><p>A <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidjeans/2024/04/19/gundo-bros-silicon-valley-military/?sh=150a428852c9&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidjeans/2024/04/19/gundo-bros-silicon-valley-military/?sh=150a428852c9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recent Forbes story</a></span> about Andreessen Horowitz’s relatively new American Dynamism fund, which is populated by defense startups, sheds some fresh light on this. Again, you would think for someone who has frequently railed against <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://twitter.com/pmarca/status/1775424509509796108&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://twitter.com/pmarca/status/1775424509509796108" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">big government</a></span>,  feeding the American War Machine might be a bit taboo. But, no, he seems perfectly fine with it. The story focuses on the “Gundo Bros,” a gaggle of patriotic software developers attached to defense startups that are endorsed by a16z. Said “bros” sound like they mostly take their cues from 1980s action movies:  </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>They pump iron while they code, host weekly bonfires on the beach, and shotgun energy drinks. They’re calling for a return to America’s hardware-building roots in El Segundo, where pioneers like Jack Northrop and Allan Lockheed built the pillars of America’s arsenal.

On <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://a16z.com/american-dynamism/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://a16z.com/american-dynamism/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">its website</a></span>, a storied timeline lays claim to a host of impressive historical events—the Wright brothers’ first flight, the invention of the transistor, the Manhattan Project, the moon landing—and frames them all as part of the American Dynamism “movement,” as if A16z had something to do with any of that stuff. “American Dynamism embodies the spirit of innovation, progress, and resilience that drives the United States forward. This powerful force is exemplified by groundbreaking achievements in technology and innovation, shaping both our nation and the global landscape,” the site says. A site visitor reading through this garbage might be distracted enough to forget that the fund is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://a16z.com/american-dynamism-50/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://a16z.com/american-dynamism-50/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">promoting a host of private defense, surveillance, and weapons contractors</a></span> who will hoard breakthroughs for themselves. </p><p> Viewed in its totality, Andreessen’s interests have a certain, chaotic uniformity. The attitude seems to be: throw anything at the wall, so long as it accelerates your money and power—deregulation, technological disruption, berzerk AI, missiles and bombs—it’s all good stuff! Some tenets of Andreessen’s belief system were laid bare last year in his “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://a16z.com/the-techno-optimist-manifesto/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://a16z.com/the-techno-optimist-manifesto/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Techno-Optimist’s Manifesto,</a></span>” which he published on his venture capital firm’s blog. Said “manifesto” is basically a spastic apology for corporate greed and wealth accumulation by a technocratic elite. It reads like some weird mixture of Gordon Gekko and Steve Jobs’ keynote speeches with a little bit of Patrick Bateman rhetoric thrown in.</p><p>Given his cartoonishly rich-douche outlook on life, it makes sense that Andreessen wouldn’t think fondly of the segments of society that don’t conform to his ubermensch-style aspirations. That is to say,  The American Prospect published <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://prospect.org/power/2024-04-24-my-dinner-with-andreessen/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://prospect.org/power/2024-04-24-my-dinner-with-andreessen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a personal essay</a></span> by the author Rick Perlstein last week that seems to provide further evidence of Andreessen’s hopelessly elitist outlook. </p><p>According to Perlstein, he was invited to what sounds like a truly insufferable party at one of Andreessen’s multi-million dollar mansions back in 2017. During this event, amidst bouts of annoying pseudo-intellectual ramblings by the dinner participants that were present, Andreessen is alleged to have said something truly dick-ish about rural Americans. Here’s that exchange as Perlstein relates it:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>I brought up the ordinary comforts of kinship, friendship, craft, memory, legend, lore, skills passed down across generations, and other benefits that small towns provide: <em>things that make human beings human beings</em>. I pointed out that there must be something in the kind of places he grew up in worth preserving. I dared venture that it is always worth mourning when a venerable human community passes from the Earth; that maybe people are more than just figures finding their proper price on the balance sheet of life …</p><p>And that’s when the man in the castle with the seven fireplaces said it.</p><p><em>“I’m glad there’s OxyContin and video games to keep those people quiet.”</em></p></blockquote><p>Or something like that. Perlstein equivocates a little bit on the exact wording that Andreessen used, claiming: </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>I’m taking the liberty of putting it in quotation marks, though I can’t be sure those were his exact words. Marc, if you’re reading, feel free to get in touch and refresh my memory. Maybe he said “quiescent,” or “docile,” or maybe “powerless.” Something, certainly, along those lines.</p></blockquote><p>Still, it  sounds like something he would say.</p><p>From what I can glean from his previous comments, Andreessen doesn’t have much fondness for anyone who doesn’t have a massive bank account. Among the charming things he’s reportedly said over the years is that the American middle class <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/andreessen-american-middle-class-an-accident-2014-10&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/andreessen-american-middle-class-an-accident-2014-10" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">was an “accident of history,”</a></span> that the American middle class “is a myth” and/or an “artifact” and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://qz.com/36368/eight-things-marc-andreessen-said-to-quartz-that-made-us-sit-up-and-listen&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://qz.com/36368/eight-things-marc-andreessen-said-to-quartz-that-made-us-sit-up-and-listen" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">that it was an</a></span> “experiment [that] has been run and it was a catastrophic failure.” Another fun thing <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://qz.com/36368/eight-things-marc-andreessen-said-to-quartz-that-made-us-sit-up-and-listen&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://qz.com/36368/eight-things-marc-andreessen-said-to-quartz-that-made-us-sit-up-and-listen" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Andreessen has said</a></span>: “I’m not saying we should have sweatshops in the US and I’m not saying we should have no environmental regulations, but it is harder to do business in most states in the US than it is to do business in a lot of places around the world.”</p><p>If the American middle class was an accident, and regulations are bad for business, and the best thing that rural Americans can do is take painkillers and play video games, but the American war machine is totally awesome...it feels like you can draw a pretty clear picture of what Andreessen thinks about the majority of Americans and where he thinks our country should go. You’d be forgiven if you aren’t as excited about it as he is. </p></div></div>]]></description>
