            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://routersecurity.org/ISProuters.php">https://routersecurity.org/ISProuters.php</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42903576">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>&nbsp; 

<p>In my opinion, you are <b>safest</b> using <i>both</i> a modem and a router that <i>you purchased</i> on your own. That is, <b>avoid  
  equipment from your ISP</b>. I say this for a number of reasons:   </p><ul>
  
<li> The devices shipped by ISPs suffer from a general level of incompetence both in their initial configuration and ongoing maintenance. 
	  If nothing else, just the fact that an ISP would install a device with the default password, tells you everything you need to know about 
	  their  interest in your security.</li>
<li>Security and convenience are always at odds with each other. Most likely an ISP will configure a router for maximum convenience to cut down on tech support calls, which cost them money. </li>
<li>Spying: We have seen that ISPs, at times, co-operate with spy agencies and governments. Even without outside influence, an ISP may well put a 
	        backdoor in the devices they give to their customers, if for no other reason than to make their life easier in some way. In this article, <a href="https://harrisonsand.com/your-isp-is-spying-on-you/">Your ISP is Probably Spying On You</a> (Feb. 2018) Harrison Sand found his router 
			was collecting information about LAN side devices and sending it the ISP.</li>		
<li>Don't be a prime target. Any router provided by an ISP to millions of customers is a prime target for bad guys and spies. More 
	     bang for the hacking buck. You are safer using a less popular device.</li>

		 <li>Many ISPs want to implement public WiFi networks in your home and there is no reason to assume these are done securely.  For my 
	    take on Comcast see <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/article/2476444/mobile-security/comcast-xfinity-wifi--just-say-no.html">Comcast XFINITY WiFi: 
		  Just say no</a>.    Cablevision is <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150721/10254131714/cablevision-follows-comcast-down-compulsory-wifi-hotspot-rabbit-hole.shtml">doing
		   the same thing</a>, which prompted Timothy Geigner to write: "This sort of news should serve to do nothing other than compel anyone who wishes
		   to remain a Cablevision customer to buy their own router and modem". See also <a href="http://betanews.com/2016/01/27/one-in-three-home-routers-will-double-as-a-public-hotspot-by-2017/">One in three home routers will double as a public
		   hotspot by 2017</a>.  According to <a href="https://www.juniperresearch.com/press/press-releases/1-in-3-home-wi-fi-routers-to-double-as-public-hots">Juniper  Research</a> the term for this is a "homespot router".</li>		   
<li>Sometimes equipment from an ISP is locked down. I have heard of cases where customers could not change a password  and where the DNS servers could not be 	 changed. I am told that in England, BT Business Hub and Sky Broadband prevent you from modifying the DNS servers and that much of France is also prevented from changing them. I ran into a Comcast-provided Arris TG1682G gateway where I could not <a href="http://m.setuprouter.com/router/arris/tg1682g/ip-address.htm">change the LAN IP address</a> of the box. I could change the subnet, but the router was always device number one which makes it a sitting duck for assorted router attacks.</li>	  
	<li>The ability to update the firmware may also be locked down. You should have full control over firmware updates.</li>	 
	<li>Backup: an ISP will give one device. Should it fail at an inopportune time, you will be off-line until you get them to issue a replacement. When you own your own 
	      hardware, you can buy a second modem and/or a router for emergency backup.</li> 
	<li>It may well be cheaper in the long run to buy your own hardware</li></ul>  

<p>As to the last point,  some ISPs charge a rental fee for the box they provide, be it just a modem or a full fledged gateway.  
     Buying your own will pay for itself soon enough. Time Warner customers looking to buy their own modem can purchase one from <a href="http://www.timewarnercable.com/en/support/internet/topics/buy-your-modem.html">this list</a> or <a href="http://www.timewarnercable.com/en/enjoy/better-twc/internet/internet-modems.html">this one</a>. Comcast users should 
   review <a href="http://mydeviceinfo.comcast.net/">mydeviceinfo.comcast.net</a>. </p> 
   
<p>October 11, 2024: My opinion is that of someone in the US and thus it may only be valid in the US. As a country, we are trending to very big companies in many different areas.  Internet Service Providers are part of this trend. Many (very likely most) people in the US are served by a single ISP. Different areas of the US have virtual monopolies when it comes to high speed Internet access. An ISP with a virtual monopoly has no motivation to do a good job. Their customers are captives. Their only goal is making money, so it is to be expected that they would provide the cheapest hardware that does the job. And, since added security will always result in more tech support calls, and these calls cost the ISP money, it is reasonable to expect that security is not a priority. If you live in a country with real competition for high speed Internet access, things might be better. </p> 
   
<p>In June 2022, on a financial Forum, someone asked <a href="https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6722588">Which is the best (most secure) home internet router for the money?</a>. One response hit home: 
 <i>"I've been on the vendor side selling networking equipment to carriers and cable companies. Their priorities for customer premises equipment (consumer) are cost, remote management and cost. Not to say their routers are bad, but you can do better."</i> To re-phrase that, ISPs want cheap routers that they can control.</p> 
 
   
<h3>ISPs SCREWING UP</h3>

<p>May 2, 2023: This is not about security, but it does show how little Spectrum cares about the boxes they give out to customers<br>
<a href="https://www.dailydot.com/news/spectrum-router-filled-with-roaches/">'Somebody had to see that before they shipped it out': Spectrum customer receives router with a live roach colony inside</a> by Jack Alban for Daily Dot. About a posting by TikToker user Fleur who was sent a router infested with cockroaches.</p>  

 <p>In November 2021, we learned of a DNS rebinding flaw in <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-59332840">six million</a> Sky routers (they are a large ISP in the U.K.). Adding insult to injury, Sky took 18 months to fix the problem and often ignored the company that found and reported the flaw, Pen Test Partners. See <a href="https://www.pentestpartners.com/security-blog/skyfail-6-million-routers-left-exposed/">SkyFail. 6 million routers left exposed</a>. </p> 
 
<p>In September 2021 we learned that  Virgin Media failed to fix a reported flaw in their routers for over two years. See: <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/virgin-media-routers-left-vpn-users-vulnerable-since-at-least-2019">Virgin Media Routers Left VPN Users Vulnerable Since at Least 2019</a> by   Nathaniel Mott for PC Magazine. </p>
	
<p>A privacy issue with IP Version 6 (IPv6) was disclosed at a <a href="https://www.blackhat.com/us-21/briefings/schedule/#ipvseeyou-exploiting-leaked-identifiers-in-ipv-for-street-level-geolocation-22889">BlackHat presentation</a> in August 2021. It is not a flaw in IPv6, instead it is lazy, stupid, ignorant choices made by assorted ISPs that continue to include a MAC address as part of the public IPv6 address. We have known for 20 years that this is a bad idea. Yet, ISPs continue to do it. For the details see <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/home-gateway-geolocation-bh21">Your Wi-Fi router could tell everyone where you live - here's what you can do about it</a> by Paul Wagenseil of Toms Guide. Researchers found over 12 million routers/gateways that included a MAC address (which should be private) in the public IPv6 address. In the US they found more than 1 million Comcast Xfinity gateway routers with this design flaw. </p>
 
<p>  In May 2019, British ISP Sky Broadband updated their broadband hubs and knocked some customers off-line. Specifically, if the customer had configured the device to use DNS servers not from Sky Broadband. It seems the latest update also removed the ability to change DNS servers altogether. See <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/04/29/sky_bricks_broadband_hubs/">Sky customers moan: Our broadband hubs are bricking it</a> and read the many comments.</p>

<p>In December 2018, <a href="https://www.tenable.com/security/research/tra-2019-17">Tenable found three bugs</a> in a Verizon FIOS router/gateway. Reading the Disclosure Timeline tells you all you need to know - not to use hardware provided by Verizon. For one thing, Verizon did not write the firmware, so they have to farm out the bug fix. Then, two bugs are dealt with by one group, while the third bug is dealt with by another group. Two bugs were already known but had not been fixed. Verizon's response was slow and bureaucratic and they have no plans to say anything publicly about the bugs.</p>
 
<p>In May 2018, we learned that <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/comcast-bug-leaks-xfinity-home-addresses-wireless-passwords/">Comcast website bug leaks Xfinity customer data</a>. The Comcast website (register.be.xfinity.com/activate), which was/is used by customers to set up their home services, could be hacked to display a customers home address, Wi-Fi network name and Wi-Fi password. And, not just display, an attacker could also change the SSID and/or Wi-Fi password. But, the issue was only for customers using equipment from Comcast. Those with their own routers were safe. An attacker only need to provide the  customer account number and their house or apartment number. If you lived at 123 Main Street, all the attacker needed to know was 123. Comcast claimed they fixed the problem, but we have no idea how long this vulnerability has existed.</p> 

<p>Then, in June 2018, we learned of <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/comcast-fixes-another-xfinity-website-data-leak/">another data leak by Comcast</a>. Any device on the network of a Comcast customer, could call an API and learn the account number, the customer's home address, the account type, and any services enabled on the line. </p>

<p><a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/mbkgn8/dont-rent-a-modem-from-comcast">For the Love of God, Stop Renting Routers From Comcast</a> by 
Karl Bode May 24 2018. On the one hand, this article brings up many different and valid points, both financial and technical. On the other hand, the author seems clueless about the difference between a router a modem and a gateway.</p>

<p>Talk Talk is a British ISP and telco. In May 2018, their routers were <a href="https://www.indigofuzz.com/article.php?docid=talktalk1430">confirmed vulnerable</a>    to the classic WPS pin code attack, first seen back in 2011. You can't make this stuff up. The flaw was discovered by a company called IndigoFuzz using a Windows program called Dumpper.</p>


<p>Another British ISP, EE, distributes gateways (combination modem and router) with a backdoor account. This came to light in October 2018, see  <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/10/26/ee_4gee_hh70_ssh_backdoor/">this article</a> from The Register. The backdoor account in their 4GEE HH70 gateways was accessible via SSH from the LAN (inside) side of the router. Worse, when the problem was reported to EE they blew it off, until The Register got involved. Even after the bad publicity, it was still not clear whether a patch had been rolled out or not. Eventually, The Register learned that EE had issued a patch, but customers have to install the new firmware themselves.</p> 
   
<p>In November 2017, a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/11/internet-paralyzing-mirai-botnet-comes-roaring-back-with-new-strain/">new botnet was discovered</a> that abused flaws in ZyXEL devices. Bad guys could remotely login to the routers/gateways using a default userid/password because a port was left open. In addition, the devices also had a hard coded superuser password, which gave attackers root privileges. Roughly 100,000 infected devices were detected, almost all of them in Argentina, specifically in the network of Telefonica de Argentina. Obviously, the ISP is at fault for giving so many of their customers devices with the same passwords.</p> 

<p>In September 2017, ESET reported that some ISPs (in two countries they refused to name) appear to be co-operating in the distribution of spyware. 
 <a href="https://www.welivesecurity.com/2017/09/21/new-finfisher-surveillance-campaigns/">New FinFisher surveillance campaigns: Internet providers involved?</a> by Filip Kafka Sept. 21,  2017. Quoting: <i>"New surveillance campaigns utilizing FinFisher, infamous spyware known also as FinSpy and sold to governments and their agencies worldwide, are in the wild ... some of these variants have been using a cunning, previously-unseen infection vector with strong indicators of major internet service provider (ISP) involvement ...  FinFisher is marketed as a law enforcement tool and is believed to have been used also by oppressive regimes ... What’s new ... in terms of distribution is the attackers' use of a man-in-the-middle attack with the "man" in the middle most likely operating at the ISP level ... When the ...  target of surveillance is about to download one of several popular (and legitimate) applications, they are redirected to a version of that application infected with FinFisher. The applications we have seen being misused to spread FinFisher are WhatsApp, Skype, Avast, WinRAR, VLC Player and some others ...  the legitimate download link [is] being replaced by a malicious one ... "</i></p>
   
<p><img src="https://routersecurity.org/pix/isp.box.hacking.sm.jpg">At the DEF CON 25 conference in the summer of 2017  Marc Newlin, Logan Lamb and Chris Grayson spoke about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxfsT4wLAfU">Wirelessly Tapping Home Networks</a>. They found 26 bugs in ISP provided hardware, both gateways and set-top boxes. Bugs were found in devices from Cisco, Arris, Technicolor, Motorola and Xfinity.  They found multiple un-authenticated remote code execution flaws, the worst of all possible bugs. Software maintenance of the devices was also poor: patches take months to deploy, official bug reports are not filed and, of course, customers (victims?) are told nothing about the problems.<br clear="all"></p>

<p>"Securing home routers is not an easy task and may require some technical knowledge. A good start is properly selecting a home router - this means avoiding free routers included in internet plans... " from <a href="https://www.trendmicro.de/cloud-content/us/pdfs/security-intelligence/white-papers/wp-securing-your-home-routers.pdf">Securing 
  Your Home Routers</a> by Trend Micro sometime in 2017.</p>   
   
 <p>In December 2016, Scott Helme wrote <a href="https://scotthelme.co.uk/my-ubiquiti-home-network/">My Ubiquiti Home Network</a> about upgrading from consumer routers to Ubiquiti. But, he lead with his thoughts about ISP provided equipment. </p>
 <p> <i>"I've never used the equipment provided by my ISP and have always used my own ... I've always been a bit of a tech geek and I like having things with extra features ... but there are some other more genuine needs. ISP (Internet Service Provider) provided equipment usually has one main factor driving the choice of hardware, <b>cost</b>. They want it to be as cheap as possible because purchasing the device and giving it to you is eating into their profits ... low cost usually means low quality in other areas than hardware too, like security. My previous ISP, EE, sent me a BrightBox router when I signed up that [had] several <a href="https://scotthelme.co.uk/ee-brightbox-router-hacked/">serious security vulnerabilities</a> ... Following their (very late) patching efforts there were <a href="https://scotthelme.co.uk/ee-brightbox-router-patched-still-vulnerable/">yet more vulnerabilities</a>. 
 I could go on and on listing the issues with ISP kit, a story even popped up on The Register about 1 million German routers being compromised whilst writing this blog, but I think you get the idea. This isn't to say other hardware will be perfect, of course it won't be, but I'd seen enough and wanted rid."</i></p> 
   
<p>In Australia in <b>October 2016</b> an ISP gave out <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/10/27/good_luck_securing_things_when_users_assume_stuff_just_works/">routers with default userid/passwords</a>  and "remarkably similar SSIDs." The article argues that: "It isn't terribly difficult to load up factory firmware that generates a random password, assigns it to a device, then prints a label with that information to go into the box with the gadget. It's more work than just slapping a default username and password into the software - but not much. And the cost, amortised against tens of thousands of units, can't be more than a penny or two."</p>  
 
 <p>Lucian Constantin, of IDG News Service, has been covering routers for Computerworld, PC World and others for a few years. On June 2, 2015, <a href="http://www.itworld.com/article/2930295/security/new-soho-router-security-audit-uncovers-over-60-flaws-in-22-models.html">writing in ITworld</a>,  about a bunch of router flaws he said:</p>
<p> <i>"Past research has shown that the security of ISP-provided routers is often worse than that  of off-the-shelf  ones. Many such devices are configured for remote administration to allow ISPs to remotely update their settings or troubleshoot connection problems.  This exposes the routers' management interfaces along with any vulnerabilities in them to the Internet, increasing the risk of exploitation. Even though  ISPs have the ability to remotely update the firmware on the routers they distribute to customers, they often don't and in some cases the users can't  do it either because they only have restricted access on the devices."</i></p> 

<p>In Nov. 2015 Bernardo Rodrigues wrote <a href="https://w00tsec.blogspot.com.au/2015/11/arris-cable-modem-has-backdoor-in.html">ARRIS Cable Modem has a Backdoor in the Backdoor</a>. The buggy devices are the Arris TG862A, TG860A, and DG860A. To be clear, these are not modems, they are gateways (combination modem and router). They suffer from XSS and CSRF vulnerabilities, hard-coded passwords, and a backdoor in a backdoor.  The backdoor can be used to enable Telnet and SSH remotely via a hidden HTTP interface or with custom SNMP MIBs. Estimates are that more than 600,000 externally accessible devices are vulnerable. Initially, Arris blew this off. Eventually CERT/CC was able to get their attention. For more, see the <a href="https://routersecurity.org/bugs.php">Router Bugs</a> page under November 2015.</p>  
 
<p>Verizon was giving new customers routers configured to use WEP years and years and years after WEP was known to be insecure. It's nice to be a monopoly. In November 2014 the FTC <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/closing_letters/verizon-communications-inc./141112verizonclosingletter.pdf">wrote a letter</a> to a Verizon rep saying "<i>... the Division of Privacy and Identity Protection has conducted an investigation into possible violations of Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act by ...   Verizon Communications.  The investigation considered whether Verizon engaged in unfair or deceptive acts or practices by failing to secure, in a reasonable and appropriate manner, the routers it provided to its High Speed Internet (DSL) and FiOS customers ...  Verizon regularly shipped routers to consumers with the default security set to an outdated encryption standard known as WEP. Due to certain weaknesses in WEP, the IEEE deprecated this standard in 2004 in favor of a new
standard known as WPA and later, WPA2. However, until recently, Verizon continued to ship some router models with the WEP encryption standard. As a result, many Verizon customers ... [are] vulnerable to hackers.</i>" Writing the letter was all the FTC did.  Clearly you can't trust Verizon with your router security.</p>

 
<h3>TR-069</h3>

<p>Another big security issue involves remote configuration of the router/modem provided by an ISP. Assorted mechanisms used by ISPs to update their devices in your home or office have been abused by bad guys to hack the devices. One remote update mechanism is a protocol with two names: TR-069 and CWMP. More than once, bugs in this protocol have been abused. </p>

<p>In November 2016, about 900,000 customers of Deutsche Telekom were knocked off-line by router problems. <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/article/3145003/internet/blame-the-isps-rather-than-the-routers.html">My blog on this attack</a>, which started with a new variant of the Mirai malware, detailed the mistakes ISPs made to get to the point where Mirai could cause so much damage. They left an open TCP/IP port undefended, and then quickly blocked it once the s..t hit the fan. Some ISP-supplied routers were running a TR-064 server that was open to the public, a huge configuration mistake. And, some routers locked up when the had to deal with the many incoming connection attempts created by the malware.</p> 
 
<p>Another example of TR-069 incompetence came to light in April 2017. <a href="https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2017/04/check-your-router/">Wordfence wrote</a> that "Your ISP should not allow someone from the public internet to connect to your router's port 7547." Well, duh. They wrote that Shoden reports over 41 million home routers with port 7547 open to the public internet. They also found over 10,000 infected home routers in Algeria and over 11,000 hacked home routers in India that they attribute to port 7547 being open.</p> 
   
<p>TR-069 was also abused in 2014. A story, by Lucian Constantin back in August  2014 is frightening. See <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/article/2491042/malware-vulnerabilities/home-routers-supplied-by-isps-can-be-compromised-en-masse.html">Home routers supplied by ISPs can be compromised en masse</a>. As of 2011, there are 147 million TR-069-enabled devices online listening on TCP port 7547.  These devices communicate with Auto Configuration Servers (ACS) operated by ISPs for assorted network management tasks. Many times a router can not close the port. If an attacker hacks into an ACS server then lots of bad stuff can happen. According to Shahar Tal, a security researcher at Check Point Software, ACS servers can be easily taken over by bad guys. The TR-069 specification recommends the use of HTTPS  but he found that insecure HTTP is used about 80 percent of the time, opening routers up to man-in-the-middle attacks. TR-069 requires authentication from the device to the ACS, but the username and password is typically shared and easily extracted. Check Point also tested several ACS servers and found critical remote code execution vulnerabilities in them. </p> 
  
<p>Open ports on ISP provided hardware are not limited to the TR-069 protocol. In September 2017, security firm Nomotion blogged about AT&amp;T U-Verse gateway devices with two open ports. One was for SSH, the other (TCP port 49152) allowed WAN side attackers to bypass the firewall. This was in addition to three hard coded backdoor accounts they discovered. The blog has a great title: <a href="https://www.nomotion.net/blog/sharknatto/">SharknAT&amp;To</a>. Adding insult to injury, was the reaction from AT&amp;T. Despite being publicly shamed, they said nothing about these security problems for two weeks (as of Sept 13, 2017). They have no shame and are doing their best to keep their customers ignorant of this. Arris, said they are looking into it and then went silent. For more see the <a href="https://routersecurity.org/bugs.php">Router Bugs</a> page under September 2017.</p>   

<p>HD Moore, chief security architect at Rapid7, and the creator of Metasploit, also <a href="http://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities---threats/no-end-in-sight-for-exposed-internet-of-things-other-devices/d/d-id/1320913">weighed  in on this</a>  on June 17, 2015. Rapid7 runs  Project Sonar, which scans the Internet for vulnerable devices. They find that things are getting worse.   On reason, cited by Moore is   <i>"that a few dozen Internet service providers are rolling out broadband devices such as home routers without  properly vetting or properly configuring the security..."</i></p>
  
  <p> ------------------ </p>

<p>Besides security, there is the issue of <b>honesty</b>. Time Warner Cable, a.k.a Spectrum and Charter was <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/summons_and_complaint.pdf">sued in New York State</a> in early 2017 for lying about the download speeds their customers were getting. In <a href="https://backchannel.com/the-alternate-facts-of-cable-companies-f0cd1e10e66">The Alternate Facts of Cable Companies</a> Harvard professor Susan Crawford writes:</p>
<p><i>"Based on the company's own documents and statements, it appears that just about everything it has been saying since 2012 to New York State residents about their internet access and data services is untrue. And not untrue in some grey, shadowy way - just untrue. The company's 2.5 million New York subscribers (of its 22 million nationwide) have been told they are getting X (in terms of download and upload speeds) when actually they are getting a lot less than X."</i></p>
<p>How was Charter/Spectrum/Time Warner Cable cheating? Three ways: <i>" ... squeezing more households into an inadequate number of narrow, shared neighborhood data connections; squeezing connections between Spectrum's network and other networks; and squeezing consumers who should have gotten upgraded household equipment."</i></p><p> 

The lawsuit was settled in December 2018 with Charter/Spectrum coughing up $176 Million. In an <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20181218/07445741254/nys-record-176-million-settlement-with-charter-crap-broadband-highlights-cables-growing-monopoly.shtml">article about this</a>, Karl Bode, of Techdirt wrote: <i>"The suit also highlights how Charter at least considered gaming the results of a program the FCC has traditionally used to measure real-world broadband speeds using custom-firmware embedded routers in consumer volunteer homes."</i>. 


</p><p>In the U.S., high speed broadband is <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20180314/09251639423/cable-industry-is-quietly-securing-massive-monopoly-over-american-broadband.shtml">pretty much a monopoly</a> everywhere. An ISP without competition has no motivation to do a good job, they are only motivated by profit. Yet another reason not to use their hardware, when possible.</p>

<p>One advantage of the new consumer focused mesh routers,  like eero, AmpliFi and Google Wifi, is that the routers themselves can run speed tests. Eero seems to do one every day. AmpliFi and Google Wifi keep a history of the speed tests, so trends are easily spotted. Eero does not keep a history. </p>
   
<p>Finally, there is a big difference between routers so don't expect to buy the perfect router for your needs right out of the box. If possible, buy a 
  router from a place that will take it back.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Dell Technologies intends to end its hybrid work arrangement in March, requiring those previously allowed to toil from home part-time to spend their entire five-day work week within corporate walls.</p>
<p>The IT biz also expects those who work remotely but within an hour's drive of a Dell office to commute in every working day henceforth. Remote workers further away will be allowed to continue their long-distance employment relationship.</p>
<p>Word of the policy change comes from founder and CEO Michael Dell, who sent an email to staff announcing the changes on Friday morning. <em>The Register</em> has seen a copy of his staff memo from an individual familiar with the matter.</p>

    

<p>Dell justified the policy change by asserting a thirty-second in-person conversation can replace an email discussion that goes on for hours or days and by noting that specific groups within the company – sales, manufacturing, and engineering – have already adjusted to being in the office five days per week.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>For the most part, you should plan to work in the office five days a week</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Starting March 3, all hybrid and remote team members who live near a Dell office will work in the office five days a week," the memo reads. "We are retiring the hybrid policy effective that day. We remain committed to flexibility within your workday, and you should continue to work with your manager to meet your needs. But for the most part, you should plan to work in the office five days a week."</p>
<p>Dell declined to share a copy of the letter while also stating that it is not challenging reports about the memo.</p>

        


        

<p>Dell's about-face on working from home belies chief operating officer Jeff Clarke's mid-pandemic assertion that "<a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/08/28/dell_q2_2021_work_from_home/">we will never go back to the way things were before</a>."</p>
<p>"Here at Dell, we expect, on an ongoing basis, that 60 per cent of our workforce will stay remote or have a hybrid schedule where they work from home mostly and come into the office one or two days a week," said Clarke during the corporation's Q2 2020 earnings conference call.</p>

        

<p>Many companies, such as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/09/25/amazon_staff_return_office/">Amazon</a>, have trimmed back or ended remote work arrangements over the past year. These return to office (RTO) mandates, however, have failed to improve corporate financial performance, according to a study last year by University of Pittsburgh business school associate professor Mark Ma and Yuye Ding, a doctoral student.</p>
<p>"Overall, our results do not support the argument that managers impose these mandates to increase firm values," the authors state in <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4675401">their paper</a>. "Instead, these findings are consistent with managers using RTO mandates to reassert control over employees and blame employees as a scapegoat for bad firm performance."</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/05/14/return_to_office_mandates/">Return-to-office mandates had senior employees jumping ship</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/02/02/return_to_office_mandates_do_not_boost_profits/">Does RTO boost profits? Nope</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/09/25/amazon_staff_return_office/">91% of polled Amazon staff unhappy with return-to-office, 3-in-4 want to jump ship</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/01/15/shove_your_mandates_people_still/">Shove your office mandates, people still prefer working from home</a></li>
</ul>
<p>As of its Q3 FY 2025 financial <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://investors.delltechnologies.com/static-files/097c4a05-1573-4a78-b63c-ea3c3981ff29">report</a> [PDF] last November, Dell's shares were up 86 percent in 2024, an increase <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/26/dell-earnings-report-q3-2025.html">attributed</a> largely to sales of servers for AI workloads.</p>
<p>Asked whether Dell has any financial data that suggests working from the office leads to better productivity or results, a spokesperson said, "We continually evolve our business so we're set up to deliver the best innovation, value and service to our customers and partners. That includes more in-person connections to drive market leadership."</p>
<p>We're told that a follow-on message went out on Friday from Doug Schmitt, CIO and president of Dell Technologies Services, instructing Services directors and above within an hour’s commute of a Dell office to begin making the trip to the office starting Monday, February 3, 2025.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>As leaders, we are expected to set the tone for rebuilding in-person collaboration</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"As leaders, we are expected to set the tone for rebuilding in-person collaboration and fostering innovation," Schmitt's memo said.</p>
<p>Dell has been <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/02/03/dell_return_to_work/">rolling back remote work policies</a> that have been in place at least since the COVID-19 pandemic, when concerns about contagion made telecommuting necessary for many organizations. In March 2024, the biz informed salespeople that they would be expected to be in the office at least three days per week. In June, half of Dell staff in the US had <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/06/20/half_of_dell_us_staff_wfh/">declined</a> to RTO. By September 2024, the corporate attendance requirement for sales <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/09/26/dell_sales_staff_full_rto/">increased</a> to five days per week.</p>

        

<p>Our source reports that there's been a trickle of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/08/06/dell_layoffs/">layoffs</a> all year and that it's unclear whether the requirement to spend more time in the office has encouraged staff to leave – one of the common claims about return to office (RTO) mandates is that they <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/02/20/dell_rto_mandate/">increase</a> voluntary headcount attrition, thereby avoiding the severance obligation entailed by layoffs.</p>
<p>"I did have coworkers who jumped ship months ago, partly as a result of RTO and partly for greener pastures with more companies on the buzzword hype train," our contact told us. "All in all though I've seen more grumbling than action." ®</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p>This was the most profound realization I had after my diagnosis. It was crucial because, without it, I wouldn't have known how to live with myself.</p><p>When I discovered that the intense emotions I felt and behavioral patterns I exhibited had a name, my first instinct was to eliminate them. The word "disorder" pushed me in that direction. I barely graduated college, bounced from one job to another (still do), avoided socializing—surely this was some kind of neurosis, I thought, and neuroses needed fixing. I convinced myself ADHD was a decayed tooth waiting to be pulled.</p><p>I spent the first few months after my diagnosis in crippling frustration, clinging to this disgusting clinical definition: </p><p>ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by chronic patterns of inattention, impulsivity, and/or hyperactivity that are inconsistent with developmental norms, leading to significant impairment in social, academic, or occupational functioning.</p><p>Looking at it now, that description is dehumanizing—but I followed it as if it were gospel.</p><p><span>The reality was that I suffered greatly not because of my ADHD, but because of my parents. The words they spoke and the decisions they made rendered me estranged. It was never their intention to cause harm, but their approach to raising me was the exact opposite of what I needed: they took certain constructs for granted, and whenever I faced challenges—in school, in socializing, in daily tasks—they never stopped to ask: </span><strong>what if this wasn't an issue of attention, but one of incompatibility?</strong></p><p><span>Instead, they relied on discipline as the only solution: withholding rights, denying privileges, banning books outside the curriculum because they "caused inattention," cutting off the internet, locking TV channels with passwords, and limiting socialization during study time. John Taylor Gatto's </span><em>Dumbing Us Down</em><span> perfectly captured this when he noticed that schools, another place where authority figures hang out, ruthlessly disciplined any child who tried to assert individuality. And my individuality, even to my parents, was weird.</span></p><p>The whole experience was abusive. Yet I forgave: I have other things to attend to if I truly want to get over what happened. What I wish they’d understood, however, is that I wasn’t inherently dysfunctional. It was the assumptions of authority figures that made me appear—and believe—I was. Their well-meaning but oblivious actions, combined with their preaching about the prizes of productivity, turned my strengths into weaknesses. Worse, it left me with a debilitating emotional and intellectual dependency on their approval.</p><p><span>The older I became, the more complicated and invasive this upbringing manifested. I can't remember how many times I doubted my instinct because it didn't align with what they called normal. The problem wasn't in my brain; it was in a childhood spent learning to apologize for how I experienced the world. And so I had to rebuild my understanding: </span><strong>I wasn't suffering from ADHD; I was suffering from forced assimilation</strong><span>. My ADHD, and yours, is not an isolated "deficit." It's a cognitive variation that cracks in environments designed for a narrowly-defined norm: in school and later at work.</span></p><p>As a child, my time was split between home and school, two places with the highest concentration of authority figures. And like all authority figures, mine had a plan for me. Follow it, and you'll arrive at the destination all humans strive for. They had an answer for every question, and the system had been in place for so long that it seemed ridiculous to even ask for clarification. But the system built within those walls, and the language they used to explain how it worked, ignored one simple fact: my brain desired nothing of their world.</p><p>In this system, I was neither good nor bad. I simply existed. You wouldn't blame a tree because its nature is incompatible with a factory. And trying to integrate it into machinery is absurd. Sure, you could cut it down and force 5% of its essence into the production line. The factory operators would congratulate themselves, maybe even give talks about successfully 'integrating nature into industry.' But the tree would no longer be a tree. When your environment treats your natural patterns as problems, no amount of self-improvement can make you feel whole.</p><p><span>As I read more and reflected on the dependent stages of my life, I realized my focus needed to shift. Instead of trying to fix myself, I needed to examine an upbringing incompatible with my ADHD. I had to let go of the instinct to rely on the ideas I was taught—about what makes a person fulfilled—as the foundation for every decision. The question was never, "How do I fix myself?" but rather, </span><strong>"What exactly did they do to the young, oblivious, dependent version of me?”</strong></p><p>I'm not alone. This is a story I’ve seen repeated in other males. If you’re an independent, working man struggling with initiation, consistency, or emotional regulation, it’s likely because something went wrong in your upbringing—something deeply unsettling happened to your brain as it developed. This was never a matter of insufficiently firing neurons: your natural patterns of thinking and being were systematically suppressed. The dissatisfaction and incompleteness you feel stem from what happened—and what could have been—during your formative years. And a simple proof is that even when you become clinically organized or productive by society’s standards, you’re still miserable, perhaps even more so.</p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://claimingattention.substack.com/p/adhd-did-not-break-me-my-parents-did?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://claimingattention.substack.com/p/adhd-did-not-break-me-my-parents-did?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel="nofollow ugc noopener"><span>Share</span></a></p><p>The good news is, it can get better. It won’t be easy, but creating an education for yourself—one managed and tailored by you—is one of the most rewarding things you can do. Here’s what I did (and continue to do) to fully embrace the brain I was born with:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Challenge every presupposed, planted conviction</strong><span>. But tread carefully: of course, there will be choices that require humility on your part. Still, take a closer look at the ideas you were fed—when you wore your school uniform, sat down to eat at the dinner table, or defended your actions to a repressive figure. What were the ideas you were taught about the definition of "normal" or "functional," and how many of those ideas are you still carrying with you?</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Question your reflexive guilt when you can't maintain a routine others consider basic</strong><span>. Examine your shame about being drawn to what they called distractions. Notice how often you internally apologize for passing thoughts. Look closely at your definition of productivity, of time well spent. Who taught you this? Watch for moments when you judge yourself using their measures of progress. Watch how you hide your rhythms because they don't look professional enough, your reactions because they don't seem normal enough, your unique ways of arriving at truth because they don't fit their narrow path of what's proper and right.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Instead of feeling bad, examine the gap between your current life and the one you yearn for.</strong><span> Every time you call yourself lazy for not starting a task, disorganized for not having a system, or unreliable for missing social cues - you're speaking in a language you were taught by people who didn't understand how your mind works. Ask yourself: am I feeling unfulfilled because I’m building on foundations that were never compatible with my mind? That dissatisfaction might not be a sign of personal failure—it might be proof that you’re still measuring success by standards you inherited rather than ones that align with how you naturally operate.</span></p></li></ul><p>Here are more focused questions I asked (and continue to ask) myself to examine the effects of an incompatible upbringing. The answer might not present itself immediately, so take your time.</p><ul><li><p><strong>What activities or behaviors were you constantly told to stop, though they felt natural to you?</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>What childhood interests did the current version of you abandon?</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Which of your self-criticisms sound exactly like your authority figures?</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Remember a really good day in your childhood during which no shame or anxiety were present. What did this day look like?</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Whose definition of success are you still trying to live up to?</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Look at your core beliefs, especially the ones that leave you disappointed for not being able to stick with them: how many of these did you choose, and how many were chosen for you?</strong></p></li></ul><p>In this landscape, you can feel broken. But the most important truth is that your mind is not. It is a vibrant ecosystem with its own patterns, its own seasons, and its own hard-won beauty. It may never fit self-referential systems, but it was never meant to. Instead, it offers an unconventional, exciting path—one lined with subtle possibilities forming as you read this. And even if no one else can see them, remember that your world is your own. And that's enough.</p></div></article></div><div id="discussion"><h4>Discussion about this post</h4></div></div>]]></description>

  <p>Swift continues to grow in popularity as a cross-platform language supporting a wide variety of use cases, with support on a <a href="https://www.swift.org/blog/embedded-swift-examples/">variety of embedded devices</a>, form factors that encompass <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/watchos-apps/building_a_watchos_app">wearables</a> to <a href="https://www.swift.org/documentation/server/">server</a>, and a wide variety of <a href="https://www.swift.org/documentation/articles/static-linux-getting-started.html">operating systems</a>. As Swift expands, there’s value in investing in matching cross-platform build tools that provide a powerful, consistent, and flexible experience across the ecosystem.</p>

<p>As a foundational step in this new chapter of Swift build technologies, today Apple is open sourcing <a href="https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-build">Swift Build</a>, a powerful and extensible build engine that provides a set of build rules for building Swift projects. Swift Build is the engine used by Xcode, which supports millions of apps in the App Store as well as the internal build process for Apple’s own operating systems. The open source repository also includes support for targeting Linux and Windows.</p>



<p>The primary responsibility of the build system is to transform user-authored inputs (such as a project description and source code) into output artifacts like command line tools, libraries, and applications. Build systems play an important role in providing a great developer experience, enabling higher level features which determine how users architect and work with their projects. Furthermore, the performance and reliability of a build system has a direct impact on developer productivity.</p>

<p>Swift Build is an infrastructural component designed to plan and execute builds requested by a higher-level client like Swift Package Manager or Xcode. It builds on top of the existing <a href="https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-llbuild">llbuild</a> project to add capabilities including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Robust integration with the Swift compiler to reliably and efficiently coordinate the build of Swift projects</li>
  <li>Support for a wide variety of product types including libraries, command line tools, and GUI applications with advanced build configuration options</li>
  <li>Build graph optimizations that maximize parallelism when building Swift and C code</li>
</ul>



<p>Compared to the build engine in Xcode, the build engine in Swift Package Manager is fairly simple. On Apple platforms, having two different ways to build packages has also led to user confusion when the two implementations’ behavior didn’t match. Contributing Xcode’s build engine to the Swift project and developing it in open source alongside the Swift compiler provides the tools necessary to address these problems and deliver a great builds experience to all Swift users. With this release, SwiftPM now has the opportunity to offer a unified build execution engine across all platforms. This change should be transparent to users and maintain full compatibility with all existing packages while delivering a consistent cross-platform experience. At the same time, it lays the foundation to enable new features and improvements across all platforms and tools, and unlocks new performance optimizations and developer-facing features. As a small first step towards this vision, today the team is submitting a pull request to begin the process of integrating support for Swift Build in SwiftPM as an alternate build engine. In the coming months, we’d like to collaborate with the community to complete the work of unifying build system integrations so users can benefit from future tooling improvements across all platforms and project models.</p>

<p>We believe this is an important step in continuing to enable a healthy package ecosystem where developers can rely on a consistent, polished development experience — no matter what IDE they’re using or platform they’re targeting. We’ll be sharing more details about this work on the Swift forums, and we’re looking forward to hearing others’ feedback!</p>



<p>We look forward to working with the community to continue evolving how we build Swift code. You can find the <a href="https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-build"><code>swift-build</code> repository</a> in the Swift organization on GitHub, including a README and documentation describing how to build and contribute. Contributions via pull requests and issues are welcome, and we’d also love to solicit feedback and ideas for improvements on <a href="https://forums.swift.org/c/development/swift-build/">the Swift forum</a>.</p>

<p>This is an exciting new chapter for Swift’s build system, and we’re looking forward to all the potential it opens for Swift!</p>

Only about 8% met the target even when including hundreds of air traffic controllers who are still in training, according to the analysis of 2023 staffing data for nearly 200 airport towers.</p><p>Additionally, none of the nation's Air Route Traffic Control Centers that handled high-altitude "en route" traffic had enough fully-trained controllers to meet the targets either.</p>

    

<p>The data, from the end of fiscal year 2023, was published in the FAA's Air Traffic Controller Workforce Plan, an annual report to Congress on the status of the agency's efforts to overcome a decades-long struggle to recruit and retain enough controllers to keep Americans safe while flying. The data shows staffing at the end of fiscal year 2023.</p><p>Nationwide, the working group's target for controllers was about 14,600, the report found. Counting only fully-trained controllers, the nation's air traffic system is at about 72% of that target. It's at 87% if trainees are included. That's about 3,000 to 4,000 controllers short of the targets, depending on whether the hundreds "in training" are counted.</p><p>In the report, the FAA cites the COVID-19 pandemic as one of the reasons it has struggled to meet staff expansion goals at air traffic control facilities across the country.</p><p>"The COVID-19 pandemic has had substantial impact on the aviation industry and the FAA," the agency said in its report. "At the onset of the pandemic, in order to protect employees and help ensure continuity of operations, certain activities were eliminated or significantly reduced at FAA's air traffic control (ATC) facilities."</p><figure><span><img src="https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/02/01/e41a75d5-a12b-4984-828e-f0b2bab44ab6/thumbnail/620x414/bce5979038c9c785067fcae8d4cd0dc6/gettyimages-2196194139.jpg?v=a599723035d2f104d7a2d01edbe96ef8#" alt="Reagan National Airport air control tower " height="414" width="620" data-srcset="https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/02/01/e41a75d5-a12b-4984-828e-f0b2bab44ab6/thumbnail/620x414/bce5979038c9c785067fcae8d4cd0dc6/gettyimages-2196194139.jpg?v=a599723035d2f104d7a2d01edbe96ef8 1x, https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/02/01/e41a75d5-a12b-4984-828e-f0b2bab44ab6/thumbnail/1240x828/11a5501402c7b165a3880f7ae4207c83/gettyimages-2196194139.jpg?v=a599723035d2f104d7a2d01edbe96ef8 2x" srcset="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%20620%20414'%2F%3E"></span>

<p>The staffing targets in the report are goals based on an analysis by a group that included FAA's Air Traffic Organization as well as the controllers' labor union, the National Air Traffic Controllers Association.</p><p>The FAA also included in the report its own internal staffing standards for each facility. Using that standard, which is lower for many facilities than the working group's targets, 45% of the airport towers met the standard, counting only fully-trained controllers. If all controllers in training are included, 59% of the airports met the lower FAA standard.</p><p>"If we hired 2,000 people today, in two, three years from now, we'd see only about 1,000 of them become a certified air traffic controller," National Air Traffic Controllers Association president Nick Daniels told CBS News.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p>Greetings from Read Max HQ! Today’s newsletter is a ~4,700-word missive on the “Zizians,” the transcontinental Rationalist cult implicated in at least six murders since 2022. In the piece, I try to explain “Rationalism,” cover the Ziz lore in a fairly straightforward fashion, and understand why Rationalism has been a breeding ground for so many cult-like objects.</p><p>A reminder! I’m able to write big slabs of in-depth newsletter like this because roughly 3,000 people out of 50,000 total subscribers currently pay to keep this newsletter afloat. I spent this week browsing some of the craziest forums online, reading some of the most tediously knotty prose imaginable, untangling the multi-state journey of this group to present in at least semi-comprehensible fashion--I was able to do it because I can treat this newsletter as a full-time job. If you’re one of the 47,000 people who’s been reading this newsletter for free, consider upgrading to a paid subscription. If you value this kind of thing (5,000 words about technocults), I’m only asking for about the price of one beer a week or ten beers a year.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff948ab44-ef98-4627-9838-f1d143944adc_1550x100.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff948ab44-ef98-4627-9838-f1d143944adc_1550x100.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff948ab44-ef98-4627-9838-f1d143944adc_1550x100.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff948ab44-ef98-4627-9838-f1d143944adc_1550x100.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff948ab44-ef98-4627-9838-f1d143944adc_1550x100.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff948ab44-ef98-4627-9838-f1d143944adc_1550x100.png" width="1456" height="94" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f948ab44-ef98-4627-9838-f1d143944adc_1550x100.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:94,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:17721,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff948ab44-ef98-4627-9838-f1d143944adc_1550x100.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff948ab44-ef98-4627-9838-f1d143944adc_1550x100.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff948ab44-ef98-4627-9838-f1d143944adc_1550x100.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff948ab44-ef98-4627-9838-f1d143944adc_1550x100.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>On the day of Donald Trump’s inauguration last week, </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/vermont-border-agent-killed-d99eb6157af85255fa23eea4b2658869" rel="">a Customs and Border Patrol agent was killed in a shootout with two unidentified people following an apparently immigration-related traffic stop miles from the Canadian border in Vermont</a><span>. You could almost hear the right-wing social-news machine salivating with desire at such an easily metabolizable story: “Border Patrol agent killed during traffic stop with migrant suspect in Vermont,” </span><a href="https://nypost.com/2025/01/20/us-news/border-patrol-agent-killed-during-traffic-stop-with-migrant-suspect-in-vermont/?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=nypost&amp;utm_medium=social" rel="">reported the</a><em><a href="https://nypost.com/2025/01/20/us-news/border-patrol-agent-killed-during-traffic-stop-with-migrant-suspect-in-vermont/?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=nypost&amp;utm_medium=social" rel=""> New York Post</a></em><span> almost immediately. </span><a href="https://x.com/sentdefender/status/1881458400376320137" rel="">Blue-check accounts surfing right-wing outrage for clicks were even less restrained, insisting that the killer was an “illegal immigrant</a><span>.”</span></p><p><span>But as it turns out, the story was not quite so easily to instrumentalize. Neither of the suspects was a “migrant,” and both were in the country legally: The surviving occupant of the stopped Honda Prius, a young woman name Teresa Youngblut, was an American citizen and computer-science student. The other, who’d been killed during the gunfight, was a German national with</span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/gun-allegedly-used-woman-us-border-agent-shoot-was-bought-person-linke-rcna189480" rel=""> a valid visa</a><span> and a history of employment </span><a href="https://x.com/deedydas/status/1882104649668530586" rel="">as a quant and software developer for well-known hedge funds like Jane Street and Radix</a><span>. Law-enforcement agents had put the pair under surveillance following a tip from an employee of their Vermont hotel, </span><a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69573795/5/1/united-states-v-youngblut/" rel="">who reported that they</a><span> “appeared to be dressed in all-black tactical style clothing with protective equipment, with [Youngblut] carrying an apparent firearm in an exposed-carry holster.”</span></p><p>None of the right-wing accounts that had initially been pushing the story seemed to know what to make of this development. Who were these armed programmers, and how did they get into a gun battle with the C.B.P.? Elsewhere on Twitter, however, the new information was clarifying, rather than confusing. “Oh no,” tweeted the blogger Jessica Taylor, once she learned the identity of the dead suspect. “I know this person. Went by ‘Ophelia’ (transfeminine). Was involved with rationalist discourse. Was somewhat of a Ziz fan. Oh no.”</p><p>Our alleged shooters--it has become clear over the past week--weren’t the thuggish murderers and rapists of fevered reactionary imagination, but Rationalists: Members of a large and loose community of autodidact and amateur philosophers and activists focused on self-described rationalist inquiry and self-improvement that’s become influential in A.I. research and philanthropy.</p><p>“Rationalism,” in and of itself, doesn’t necessarily lead its adherents into violent confrontations with the state. But it’s also been a breeding ground for a number of--at best--cult-like social formations. For their part, Youngblut and Ophelia, as well as suspects and persons of interest in at least three other murders around the country, seem to have fallen in with the infamous Rationalist blogger “Ziz,” who espouses a hardline philosophy of justice and an eccentric theory of cognition, and whose charisma and rhetorical technique is notable enough among Rationalists to have inspired a number of websites and posts “warning” about her influence.</p><p><span>Within six months I feel confident we’ll get at least two, and possibly as many as four long-form reported pieces written about the Zizians--</span><em>someone </em><span>has to create the I.P. that can be bought and repackaged for the true-crime streaming docudrama!--not to mention a number of podcasts. (It’s unlikely that anyone trying to explain and understand this story, including your humble newsletter proprietor, will outdo the homies at TrueAnon, </span><a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/episode-434-evil-121111568" rel="">whose episode on the Zizians and Rationalists dropped while I was writing this</a><span>.) For now, I can do my best to cobble together a kind of explainer based on the copious but often impenetrable documentation of the Zizian world assembled by Rationalists and fellow travelers.</span></p><p>To best understand Zizians, it helps to have at least a small grounding in the world of Rationalism, which I’m using here as an umbrella term to cover a capacious number of people and groups with overlapping jobs, hobbies, institutions, and interests. (I’m capitalizing the “R” to specify that I mean a very specific contemporary community and school of thought, and not referring to the Enlightenment epistemology, or to any use of reason to pursue or arrive at truth.)</p><p><span>The main idea behind the “Rationalist Movement,” </span><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/rationalist-movement#fn8" rel="">as the community sometimes calls itself</a><span>, is that human beings can and should develop their reasoning skills to better purse good (personal, political, economic) outcomes. In practice this tends to mean (1) coming up and experimenting with “cognitive hacks” and “de-bugging” tricks to think more rationally and (2) pursuing </span><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/timeless-decision-theory" rel="">abstract but meticulously thought-through philosophical games and experiments</a><span> and then attempting to live in compliance with the (often seemingly ridiculous) consequences of that reasoning.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1-156012376" href="https://maxread.substack.com/p/the-zizians-and-the-rationalist-death#footnote-1-156012376" target="_self" rel="">1</a></span><span> The most famous version of this Rationalist impulse is reasoning yourself into a belief that a godlike computer-based super-intelligence is inevitably coming, and therefore the best use of your time in the present is to devote yourself to ensuring its compliance with human morality.</span></p><p><span>This is, more or less, what the godfather of the Rationalist Movement, a man named Eliezer Yudkowsky, believes. Yudkowsky is the founder of the LessWrong forums--the main online gathering place for Rationalists--as well as the author of </span><em>Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality</em><span>, a series-length fanfic in which Harry Potter applies Yudkowsky’s reasoning principles to the magic world. (</span><em>HPMoR</em><span>, as it’s known, is many budding Rationalists’ gateway to the community.) Yudkowsky is also the founder of the Machine Intelligence Research Institute (M.I.R.I.), a nonprofit dedicated to ensuring that “smarter-than-human A.I.” is safe.</span></p><p><span>Yudkowsky’s long history of banging on about A.I. has helped make both his anxiety about the singularity, and his style of thinking, prominent in the A.I. industry. (OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit, and </span><a href="http://maxread.substack.com/p/the-interested-normies-guide-to-openai" rel="">nearly broke apart in 2023</a><span>, in part over Yudkowsky-type concerns over “alignment.”) But not everyone under the broad Rationalist umbrella is so intently focused on A.I.: “Effective Altruism,” the utilitarian school of philanthropy that famously lay behind Sam Bankman-Fried’s desire to amass wealth, owes a huge debt to the Rationalist movement (seen in, e.g., the idea of “longtermism”).</span></p><p>And the other key Rationalist institution, the Center for Applied Rationality (C.F.A.R.)--which was founded by a number of prominent LessWrong posters--avoids much A.I. talk and focuses on holding workshops for businesses or interested would-be Rationalists “where we teach and train techniques for forming accurate beliefs, navigating intellectual disagreement, making better use of our internal advisors, developing non-self-deceptive motivation, and building the habit of getting things done.” </p><p><span>Anyway, this should cover enough to follow the rise of the Zizians. If you want a somewhat deeper dive into the world and culture of the Rational movement, I recommend Ellen Huet’s Bloomberg article “</span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2023-03-07/effective-altruism-s-problems-go-beyond-sam-bankman-fried" rel="">The Real-Life Consequences of Silicon Valley’s AI Obsession</a><span>,” Cade Metz’s </span><em>New York Times </em><span>piece “</span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/13/technology/slate-star-codex-rationalists.html" rel="">Silicon Valley’s Safe Space</a><span>,” and Timni Gebru and Émile P. Torres’ paper “</span><a href="https://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/13636" rel="">The TESCREAL Bundle</a><span>.”</span></p><p><span>The story of the Zizians, such as it is, begins in 2019. Ziz, a computer engineer, </span><a href="https://www.uaf.edu/commence/files/2013/degrees/CEM.pdf" rel="">graduated from the University of Alaska Fairbanks in 2013</a><span> and moved to the Bay Area in 2016 </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220329011601/https://sinceriously.fyi/rationalist-fleet/" rel="">with the intent of finding a job</a><span> and becoming more involved in A.I. safety and alignment initiatives. She </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220328111256/https://sinceriously.fyi/net-negative/" rel="">seems to have become well-known around M.I.R.I. and C.F.A.R.</a><span>, attending workshops and lecture, but by 2019, </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220328111256/https://sinceriously.fyi/net-negative/" rel="">after being told by a C.F.A.R. higher-up that she was likely “net negative”</a><span> to the cause of “doing something about A.I.,” Ziz had become disillusioned with the institutions of Rationalism.

As complex and jargon-heavy as much of the writing is outwardly, the gist of what Ziz beleieves is relatively straightforward; </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210718152834/https://hivewired.wordpress.com/2021/05/06/my-journey-to-the-dark-side/" rel="">here’s an excerpt from a good 2021 gloss by a semi-sympathetic interlocutor who goes by the name Slimepriestess</a><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p>Ziz adheres to a moral principle which classifies all life which has even the potential to be sentient as people and believes that all beings with enough of a mind to possess some semblance of selfhood should have the same rights that are afforded to humans. To her, carnism is a literal holocaust, on ongoing and perpetual nightmare of torture, rape, and murder being conducted on a horrifyingly vast scale by a race of flesh eating monsters.</p></blockquote><p><span>This kind of radical veganism isn’t, in the grand scheme of things, all that strange, especially not among the utilitarians of LessWrong and its associated evirons.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3-156012376" href="https://maxread.substack.com/p/the-zizians-and-the-rationalist-death#footnote-3-156012376" target="_self" rel="">3</a></span><span> Nor, for that matter, is Ziz’s well-documented identification with all kinds of fictional characters and dynamics--in particular the evil Sith order of the Star Wars universe.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-4-156012376" href="https://maxread.substack.com/p/the-zizians-and-the-rationalist-death#footnote-4-156012376" target="_self" rel="">4</a></span><span> (Hence the frequent headline description of Zizians as “Vegan Sith.”) More distinctive </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210802144947/https://hivewired.wordpress.com/2019/12/02/hemisphere-theory-much-more-than-you-wanted-to-know/" rel="">is what Slimepriestess calls Ziz’s “hemisphere theory”</a><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p>Ziz states… that most of humanity is neutral or evil, a combined category she calls nongood. They have let evil social norms siphon off their agency and turn them into puppets of an evil system. They have no free will and are okay being puppets of that evil system because they themselves are either actively evil or just don’t care. […] Ziz believes that good is a property of a person’s core. In her earlier posts… this is defined as a sort of nebulous thing that exists at the bottom of a stack of mental structures. Later posts go on to describe this as the specific property of a hemisphere, as in the kind you have two of sitting in your head. You have a left brain and a right brain, and Ziz claims these hemispheres are each a separate person.</p><p><span>[…] In 1 out of 20 people, one hemisphere will have this </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210802144947/https://sinceriously.fyi/spectral-sight-and-good/" rel="">defect</a><span> that causes them to see all creatures the way an average person might see a human child. This makes them Single Good. In 1 out of every 400 people, both of these hemispheres will have this glitch, and the person will be Double Good.</span></p><p><span>Separately from this, one or both of these hemispheres can be the opposite sex to the body, an “</span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210802144947/https://sinceriously.fyi/intersex-brains-and-conceptual-warfare/" rel="">intersex brain condition</a><span>” which leads one to end up trans or nonbinary. If someone has one hemisphere of one sex, and the other hemisphere another sex, they’re bigender. The Left hemisphere tends to be the male one in bigender humans and the right hemisphere tends to be the female one.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>According to Ziz, these two separate hemispheres can be “debucketed” and given independent awareness, not unlike the controversial dissociative identity disorder diagnosis. </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220202165812/https://sinceriously.fyi/good-group-and-paseks-doom/" rel="">In 2018, Ziz and some friends experimented with “unihemispheric sleep”</a><span> i.e., an attempt to put one half of your brain to sleep, as a means of “debucketing.” One friend, Maia Pasek--who, Ziz writes, later “changed ‘Maia’ to just the name of their right hemisphere. And ‘Shine’ to be the name of the left hemisphere”--</span><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/pQGFeKvjydztpgnsY/occupational-infohazards" rel="">allegedly died by suicide in the midst of these experiments</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>But Pasek’s death didn’t seem to have much effect on Ziz’s developing radical practice. In November 2019, Ziz, then 28, and three associates--“Zizians,” though they probably wouldn’t have described themselves as such--</span><a href="https://www.sonomanews.com/article/news/authorities-id-four-arrested-in-westminster-woods-protest/?artslide=3" rel="">donned Guy Fawkes masks and barricaded the entrance to a C.F.A.R. reunion celebration</a><span>, refusing to let participants leave. The police were called, a S.W.A.T. team was sent in, and the four protestors were arrested. A transcript of the two-page pamphlet the protestors were said to be handing out </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200905172318/https://archive.nova.noblejury.com/ziz/ziz-pamphlet-transcript.txt" rel="">is still available online</a><span>; here’s a selection from the second page:</span></p><blockquote><div><p><span>Eliezer offered us heaven</span><br><span>Ill considered-solace in hopes of heaven worships hell</span></p><p><span>Two futures only?

For their part, Ziz and the Zizians were, based on their own blog posts, further radicalized by the aggressive and violent tactics of the police who were called to break up the barricade. They eventually filed a lawsuit against Sonoma County over civil-rights violations.</span></p><p><span>The Zizians laid low for the next few years, continuing to blog and elaborate their theories of the mind as the pandemic spread across the country. In 2021, another Ziz associate, Jay Winterford, died by suicide; </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210303031310/https://www.mentalengineering.info/containment-causes-suicidality/" rel="">his final blog post</a><span> refers obliquely to some of Ziz’s philosophical concepts. That same year, Ziz and another C.F.A.R. protest arrestee, Gwen Danielson, skipped bail and failed to show up to their court dates. In November, the group’s lawyer </span><a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.387955/gov.uscourts.cand.387955.47.0.pdf" rel="">attested in a filing</a><span> that </span><a href="https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/newsminer/name/jack-lasota-obituary?id=36432272" rel="">Ziz had apparently died in a boating accident</a><span>, and that Danielson </span><a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/61432586/43/danielson-v-sonoma-county/" rel="">had disappeared and was rumored to have killed herself</a><span> at the age of 28.</span></p><p>Around the same time, the other two Zizian arrestees--Emma Borhanian, 31, and a 27-year-old who goes by “Somni”--were, along with someone called Suri Dao, involved in an altercation with their landlord, an 80-year-old man named Carl Lind who’d opened up some property to RVs and container housing. Lind had been attempting to evict the Zizians, who were supposedly in arrears; in November 2022, a few days before law enforcement was scheduled to undertake the eviction, Somni stabbed Lind through the chest with a samurai sword. Lind in turn shot Somni and Borhanian; Borhanian later died of her wounds, while Lind and Somni survived.</p><p><span>And who else was at the scene? None other than Ziz and Danielson, still quite alive. (Danielson’s name was apparently on the lease.) </span><a href="https://medium.com/@sefashapiro/a-community-warning-about-ziz-76c100180509" rel="">According to SefaShapiro’s meticulous writeup of Zizian activities over the last few years</a><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p>Someone I know contacted the police to learn more, and was told that Solano County law enforcement encountered Ziz at the scene, and were aware that Ziz had skipped bail and had a warrant out for her arrest. Bizarrely, however, they didn’t arrest Ziz. Allegedly Ziz said she was in pain and that she needed to go to the hospital, and the police didn’t want the extra trouble of waiting for Ziz to be discharged.</p></blockquote><p><span>Bizarre, indeed. Just a few weeks later, Ziz was arrested in Pennsylvania </span><a href="https://x.com/DracoGlass/status/1883011592826364054/photo/1" rel="">for obstruction of justice and disorderly conduct</a><span> in connection with </span><a href="https://6abc.com/chester-heights-murder-investigation-richard-zajko-rita-delaware-county-homicide/12757224/" rel="">the double homicide of Richard Zajko, 72, and Rita Zajko, 69</a><span>. The Zajkos’ daughter, Michelle, who went by “plum” online, is a friend of Ziz who </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220217023845/https://www.plumofdiscord.com/post/675855867193769984/i-became-a-full-time-internet-pest-and-may-not" rel="">once wrote a blog post describing Ziz’s attempts to convince her to murder Ziz’s mentor Alice</a><span>; according to SefaShapiro, Pennsylvania police have said that Ziz, Michelle, and a third person named Daniel Blank were “very plausibly involved in the double homicide.”</span></p><p>Ziz was released by Pennsylvania authorities in mid-2023, and the Zizians were largely unheard from for the next 18 months. Then, on January 17, three days before the Vermont shootout, Carl Lind, the Zizians’ former landlord, was stabbed to death in Vallejo. A week later, cops arrested a 22-year-old data scientist named Maximilian Snyder--who had previously applied for a marriage license with Teresa Youngblut in Washington state in November. </p><p><span>Meanwhile, Michelle Zajko, who owns property in Vermont not far from the location of the shootout, is back in the news--because she appears to have purchased the guns that Ophelia and Youngblut were carrying last Monday and </span><a href="https://vtdigger.org/2025/01/28/federal-officials-link-third-person-of-interest-to-vermont-border-patrol-agents-shooting/" rel="">has been named a person of interest in the shooting</a><span>. In a court filing from earlier this week, the prosecutor on Youngblut’s case obliquely referenced Ziz, </span><a href="https://vtdigger.org/2025/01/27/prosecutor-says-woman-charged-in-fatal-border-agent-shooting-had-ties-to-people-of-interest-in-other-homicides/" rel="">who’s clearly of interest to law enforcement now</a><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p>Both Youngblut and the person who allegedly purchased the firearms used in the Vermont shooting, Lasher wrote, were “acquainted with and have been in frequent contact with an individual who was detained by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania during that homicide investigation; that individual is also a person of interest in a homicide investigation in Vallejo, California.”</p></blockquote><p>Ziz, as far as I know, as still at large.</p><p><span>The Zizians, believe it or not, are not the only cult-like groupuscule to have emerged from the heady stew of the Rationalist community. In 2021, </span><a href="https://medium.com/@zoecurzi/my-experience-with-leverage-research-17e96a8e540b#c778" rel="">Zoe Curzi wrote a long Medium post about her time at the Rationalism-adjacent nonprofit Leverage Research</a><span>, which held “2–6hr long group debugging sessions in which we as a sub-faction (Alignment Group) would attempt to articulate a ‘demon’ which had infiltrated our psyches from one of the rival groups, its nature and effects, and get it out of our systems using debugging tools,” and whose employees “genuinely thought we were going to take over the US government.”  </span></p><p><span>That essay </span><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/MnFqyPLqbiKL8nSR7/my-experience-at-and-around-miri-and-cfar-inspired-by-zoe#Strange_psycho_social_metaphysical_hypotheses_in_a_group_setting" rel="">inspired a LessWrong post from Jessica Taylor</a><span> about her experiences at M.I.R.I. and C.F.A.R., where “there were also psychotic breaks involving demonic subprocess narratives,” and where people in positions of power would “debug” underlings. “I experienced myself and others being distanced from old family and friends, who didn't understand how high-impact the work we were doing was,” she writes. </span><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/MnFqyPLqbiKL8nSR7/my-experience-at-and-around-miri-and-cfar-inspired-by-zoe?commentId=4j2GS4yWu6stGvZWs" rel="">In the comments at the time</a><span>, Scott Alexander, maybe the most prominent Rationalist besides Yudkowsky, suggested that the problem was not really M.I.R.I. or C.F.A.R. so much as that Taylor was in a cult-like group centered around a former M.I.R.I. head named Michael Vassar</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-6-156012376" href="https://maxread.substack.com/p/the-zizians-and-the-rationalist-death#footnote-6-156012376" target="_self" rel="">6</a></span><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p>Jessica was (I don't know if she still is) part of a group centered around a person named Vassar, informally dubbed "the Vassarites". Their philosophy is complicated, but they basically have a kind of gnostic stance where regular society is infinitely corrupt and conformist and traumatizing and you need to "jailbreak" yourself from it (I'm using a term I found on Ziz's discussion of her conversations with Vassar; I don't know if Vassar uses it himself). Jailbreaking involves a lot of tough conversations, breaking down of self, and (at least sometimes) lots of psychedelic drugs.</p><p>Vassar ran MIRI a very long time ago, but either quit or got fired […] Since then, he's tried to "jailbreak" a lot of people associated with MIRI and CFAR - again, this involves making them paranoid about MIRI/CFAR and convincing them to take lots of drugs. The combination of drugs and paranoia caused a lot of borderline psychosis, which the Vassarites mostly interpreted as success ("these people have been jailbroken out of the complacent/conformist world, and are now correctly paranoid and weird"). Occasionally it would also cause full-blown psychosis, which they would discourage people from seeking treatment for, because they thought psychiatrists were especially evil and corrupt and traumatizing and unable to understand that psychosis is just breaking mental shackles. </p></blockquote><p><span>Taylor </span><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/pQGFeKvjydztpgnsY/occupational-infohazards" rel="">wrote a follow-up post disputing Alexander’s account</a><span> of the situation; I don’t know that I have the patience or energy to really get to the bottom of it all except to say: </span><em>It all kinda sounds pretty culty to me!</em><span> And I haven’t even gotten into </span><a href="https://x.com/QiaochuYuan/status/1464742982943264768" rel="">the Burning Man camp Black Lotus</a><span> or </span><a href="https://medium.com/@shekinahalegra/dear-monastic-academy-and-community-members-49c25d9646a4" rel="">the Monastic Academy for the Preservation of Life on Earth</a><span>!</span></p><p><span>Why does Rationalism have a tendency to produce cults, or at least cult-like clusters? The basic answer, I think, is that the whole Rationalist program effectively generates potential cult subjects. Here, to give an example, is </span><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/LbbrnRvc9QwjJeics/new-user-s-guide-to-lesswrong#What_LessWrong_is_about___Rationality_" rel="">an excerpted list of personal qualities that make for a likely Rationalist</a><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p>LessWrong is a good place for someone who:</p><ul><li><p><span>values curiosity, learning, self-improvement, figuring out what's actually true (rather than just what you </span><em>want </em><span>to be true or just winning arguments)</span></p></li><li><p>will change their mind or admit they're wrong in response to compelling evidence or argument</p></li><li><p>wants to work collaboratively with others to figure out what's true […] </p></li><li><p><span>is nerdy and interested in all questions of </span><em>how the world works</em><span> and who is not afraid to reach weird conclusions if the arguments seem valid</span></p></li></ul></blockquote><p>These are all good qualities individually. But as a whole package what you have is a person convinced of their own inadequacy, eager for social connection and personal development, and endlessly persuadable by sophistry. Feeling comfortable with your own epistemological position, even if you know it’s flawed, is not the preferred mode for Rationalist development, but it’s pretty foundational to building a stable sense of self. By the same token, the ability to dismiss an argument with a “that sounds nuts,” without needing recourse to a point-by-point rebuttal, is anathema to the rationalist project. But it’s a pretty important skill to have if you want to avoid joining cults.</p><p>Just based on its name and its most prominent interests, it’s easy to imagine the Rationalist Movement as a kind of empirically grounded alliance of engineers promoting the scientific method. And there are certainly groups underneath the big Rationalist umbrella for whom that is a fair description. But when you poke around a little bit--when you read about how “Rationalism” plays out in its communities in practice--the “movement” starts to feel a little less STEM and a lot more New Age: A suspect program for self-improvement, with existential stakes, a strong emphasis on self-experimentation, and a deleterious commitment to openness. In this sense its predecessors are not really the original enlightenment rationalists, but the dubious touchstones of ‘60s-hangover California--Scientology and Dianetics, Werner Erhard and est, the Symbionese Liberation Army and the Manson Family.</p></div></article></div><div id="discussion"><h4>Discussion about this post</h4></div></div>]]></description>

Already, content from the CDC’s <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/yrbs/index.html">Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System</a>, which includes data from a national survey, has disappeared; so have parts of the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/place-health/php/svi/index.html">Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry’s Social Vulnerability Index</a> and the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/place-health/php/eji/index.html">Environmental Justice Index</a>. The CDC’s <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/hiv-data/index.html">landing page for HIV data</a> has also vanished. And the agency’s <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchhstp/about/atlasplus.html">AtlasPlus tool</a>, which contains nearly 20 years of CDC surveillance data on HIV, hepatitis, sexually transmitted infections, and tuberculosis, is down. Several scientists I talked with told me they had heard directly from contacts at the CDC that the agency has directed employees to scrub any mention of “gender” from its site and the data that it shares there, replacing it with “sex.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The full scope of the purge isn’t yet clear. One document obtained by <em>The Atlantic</em> indicated that the government was, as of yesterday evening, intending to target and replace, at a minimum, several “suggested keywords”—including “pregnant people, transgender, binary, non-binary, gender, assigned at birth, binary [<em>sic</em>], non-binary [<em>sic</em>], cisgender, queer, gender identity, gender minority, anything with pronouns”—in CDC content. While these terms are often politicized, some represent demographic variables that researchers collect when tracking the ebb and flow of diseases and health conditions across populations. Should they be reworded, or even removed entirely, from data sets to comply with the executive order, researchers and health-care providers might have a much harder time figuring out how diseases affect specific communities—making it more challenging to serve Americans on the whole.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">CDC data’s “explicit purpose” is to guide researchers toward the places and people who most need attention, Patrick Sullivan, an epidemiologist at Emory University and a former CDC Epidemic Intelligence Service officer, told me. As the changes unfold before him, he said, “it’s hard to understand how this benefits health.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">When I contacted the CDC, a spokesperson redirected my requests for comment to the Department of Health and Human Services. After this story was published, an HHS spokesperson said that “all changes to the HHS website and HHS division websites are in accordance with President Trump’s January 20 Executive Orders” on gender and DEI.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The government appears to understand that these changes could have scientific implications: The document directing a review of CDC content suggests that some work could be altered without “changing the meaning or scientific integrity of the content,” and that any such changes should be considered “routine.” Changing other content, according to the document, would require review by an expert precisely because any alterations would risk scientific integrity. But the document does not specify how data would be sorted into those categories, or at whose discretion.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">“My fear is that in the short term, entire data sets would be taken down,” then reappear with demographic variables removed or altered to conform with DEI restrictions, Katie Biello, an epidemiologist at Brown, told me. Excising mention of gender and sexual orientation, for instance, from public-health data sets could require stripping entire columns of data out. If the government chooses to define sex as binary, transgender people and nonbinary people, among others, could be effectively erased. In response to the ongoing changes, some groups of researchers are now rushing to archive the CDC website in full.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Acknowledging and addressing health differences among demographic groups is a basic epidemiological tenet, Biello told me, “so we know where to target our health interventions.” She pointed to examples in her own field: Gay men have <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/sti/about/about-stis-and-gay-men.html">higher rates of STIs</a>, but <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9067055/">lower rates of obesity</a>; transgender women have <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/01/25/transgender-women-hiv-socioeconomic-risks-cdc/">higher rates of HIV</a>, but lower rates of prostate cancer. More broadly, demographic changes to data sets could limit the country’s ability to identify which Americans are most at risk from an expansive list of conditions including adolescent depression, STIs, even sex-specific cancers. Changing data sets in this way would be tantamount to “erasing our ability to use data and evidence” to care for people, Rachel Hardeman, a health-equity expert at the University of Minnesota, told me.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at Brown, pointed to mpox as a recent example of how replacing “gender” with “sex,” or ignoring sexual orientation, could limit effective public-health responses. At the beginning of the United States’ 2022 outbreak, neither researchers nor the public had much clarity on who was most affected, leading to widespread panic. “Officials were talking about the situation as if it was a risk we equally faced,” Nuzzo said. By collecting detailed demographic information, researchers were able to show that the disease was primarily affecting men who have sex with men, allowing officials to more efficiently allocate resources, including vaccines, and bring the epidemic under control before it affected Americans more widely.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">A scrub such as this could also change how the government allocates funds for long-standing threats to public health, which could widen health-equity gaps, or reverse progress in combatting them. Rates of STIs more generally have recently begun to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/12/health/syphilis-gonorrhea-chlamydia-cdc.html">plateau</a> in the U.S., after decades of steady increase—but altering data that focus interventions on, say, transgender populations, or men who have sex with men, could undo those gains. If no data exist to prove that a health issue concentrates within a particular community, that “provides a justification to cut funding,” one researcher told me. (Several scientists who spoke with me for this article requested anonymity, for fear of retaliation for speaking out about the loss of federal data.) Sullivan, whose work focuses on HIV surveillance, compared the government’s actions to, effectively, destroying the road map to determining who in America most needs screening, pre-exposure prophylaxis, and treatment.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Much of the data on the CDC website have been aggregated from states, so it would be possible for researchers to reassemble those data sets, Nuzzo pointed out. But that’s an onerous task, and several scientists told me they never thought they’d be in a position where they’d have to scramble to squirrel away publicly available federal data. Nuzzo also worried that states might be reluctant in the future to share data with the federal government, or might decide not to bother collecting certain data at all. On the most basic scientific level, changing federal-government data means those data become unreliable. Public-health data are collected with the intention of sussing out which populations most need health interventions; altering those data leaves behind a skewed portrait of reality.</p></section><gpt-ad format="injector" sizes-at-0="mobile-wide,native,house" targeting-pos="injector-most-popular" sizes-at-976="desktop-wide,native,house"></gpt-ad></article></div>]]></description>

					<h2>Deepseek Ai Rig Build for Local Inference</h2>
<p>Let’s start with the good news. I got very solid performance off the same baseline AMD EPYC Rome system that has been at the core of our entire journey 😁 That initial parts selection has remained fantastic! Owners of that system are going to get some great news today also as they can hit between 4.25 to 3.5 TPS (tokens per second) on the Q4 671b full model. This is important as the distilled versions are simply not the same at all. They are vastly inferior and other models out perform them handily. Running the full model, with a 16K or greater context window, is indeed the pathway to the real experience and it is worthwhile. Since this runs decent enough on CPU alone it also can hang out while you run smaller models, like vision models, at the same time. To reiterate, this will not fully run in only GPU VRAM alone unless you have a massive rig. I will show you all the tips and tricks to get this working. It is not “easy” but if you like tech tinkering it is a lot of fun.</p>
<p>ADDED ERRATA BELOW 02/01/2024<br>
Idle wattage: 60w (well below what I expected, this is w/o GPUs plugged in)<br>
Loaded wattage: 260w<br>
RAM Speed I am running currently: 2400 (V likely 3200 has a decent perf impact)</p>

<h3>Local AI CPU Compute Hardware</h3>
<p>If you followed the original build guide for quad 3090s I put out, you are in luck. That 7702 still packs a punch. I will recommend a better CPU as it is now in that same price bracket and performance should be a good deal better, but these results you see are from the 7702 in my machine. The MZ32-AR0 was also a very good board recommendation to start with as well as it lowers the price of hitting 512GB to 1TB of System Ram dramatically with 16 dimm slots that can run at a full 3200 speed. The ram I am running is actually 2400 DDR4 dimms but you would likely get additional performance improvement by going with 3200 speed DDR4 ECC dimms. 16x 32GB dimms gets you to 512 GB. 16x 64GB dimms gets you to 1TB RAM. <strong>You cannot mix LRDIMM and RDIMMS!</strong></p>

</ul>
<p>(<em>Prices as of 1/29/2025</em>)<br>
<strong><em>Total Cost: Around $2000 </em></strong><em>if you use 512GB 2400 RAM and EPYC 7702. I would get the 7C13 or 7V13 vs upgraded speed of RAM. Getting 768GB RAM would be my second choice in upgrade and finally getting 3200 RAM would be the last option I would do. If you price it in at the top with the 7C13 or 7V13 and 1TB DDR4 2400 it’s more like $2500.</em></p>
<h4>Rig Rack Assembly</h4>
<p>Assembly is as it was in the prior video still minus GPUs and Risers. If you are going to add in GPUs later, I would recommend getting a 1500w or 1600w PSU up front. The rest all stays the same if you add in GPUs and Risers. You can watch that video from here. Just ignore the GPU parts of this video, the rest is the exact same.</p>

<p>Additionally, you want to get a little fan wall made and zip tied together that blows directly over the RAM sticks to keep them cooler. They will not melt but they will thermally throttle and impact performance negatively as you churn data in them nonstop. I used 4x 80mm little ones.</p>

<h4>Motherboard Upgrades Notes</h4>
<p>You are better off buying a V3 version of the MZ32-AR0 motherboard vs getting V1 and upgrading it if you are going with the AMD EPYC 7V13. The V1 may not out of the box support a Milan CPU until it is at V3, so you would need a V2 CPU possibly. I can not confirm that but I suspect it is likely. You can upgrade the V1 to the V3 in my experience by using the bios updates to jump a V1 board all the way up to the latest version, then grabbing a V3 early bios update and running that. Then you can update to later V3 bios versions from that page. Current as of time of writing is <a href="https://www.gigabyte.com/Enterprise/Server-Motherboard/MZ32-AR0-rev-3x#Support-Bios" target="_blank" rel="noopener">M23_R40 bios revision</a>.</p>
<h2>Local AI Self Hosted Software Setup</h2>
<p>This is where things get a bit on the tricky side vs the prior guides I have used. Yes you can deploy Ollama on a bare metal proxmox installation. Should you? Not ideally, no. You have two options at this point and I will show you one of them now. I need to test and see performance impacts before I recommend the other, but running Ollama inside a stand alone LXC or VM is the other option. <strong>If you have followed my prior LXC and DOCKER guide, follow along with this but install in a VM is my advice for now.</strong> I will be working on a more unified approach to get this all working in our happy little Ai server self contained environment but that will take time.</p>
<h3>Install Our Ubuntu 24 on Bare Metal or Proxmox VM?</h3>
<p>Basically you should install this on a bare metal Ubuntu 24.04 server base if you want to eliminate extra things and are setting this up new and fresh, or follow the prior proxmox guide. You have to make this call yourself and live with the results. You can install a desktop if you want but its not needed nor will I demonstrate that. You are running services on top of a server, the CLI is not to be feared at all.</p>
<h3>Setting up your BMC MZ32-AR0</h3>
<p>Connect your MZ32-AR0 ethernet and BMC ports to your local network. If you have a firewall router, like opnsense or pfsense, you can check your ARP for your port to show up. Grab that ip address. In my instance it was https://192.168.1.XX and when I log in it asks for a username and password right off the bat. The default username is admin. The password should be a sticker on YOUR motherboard under the MZ32-AR0 stamp. Here is mine pictured. It is the barcode bearing label. I forget exactly but it’s something like removing the first 3/C/ part and the next 6 or possibly 11 characters are the initial password. When you log in finally, go to</p>
<p><i></i>Home &gt; Settings &gt; Network &gt; Network IP Settings</p>
<p>and set a static IP for your board. Also set a DNS locally if you use that and a NTP server. You will log into this interface often so bookmark it or something.</p>
<p><a href="https://digitalspaceport.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/1024-576-max.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="https://digitalspaceport.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/1024-576-max.jpg" alt="" width="694" height="391" srcset="https://digitalspaceport.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/1024-576-max.jpg 1024w, https://digitalspaceport.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/1024-576-max-300x169.jpg 300w, https://digitalspaceport.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/1024-576-max-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 694px) 100vw, 694px"></a></p>
<p>Next go to the remote control on the sidebar. It will land you on a page that has HTML5 viewer as an option. I would recommend doing this from a wired connection since we will be sending a large ISO over the network to install Ubuntu 24.04 in a bit. Grab the server version of an <a href="https://ubuntu.com/download/server" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ISO of ubuntu 24</a> their download page. Its like 2.5GB. Connect it to your HTML5 viewer in the upper right side.</p>
<p><a href="https://digitalspaceport.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/html5-iso-attach.png"><img decoding="async" src="https://digitalspaceport.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/html5-iso-attach.png" alt="" width="497" height="262" srcset="https://digitalspaceport.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/html5-iso-attach.png 497w, https://digitalspaceport.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/html5-iso-attach-300x158.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 497px) 100vw, 497px"></a></p>
<p>Once you click start it will spool up a bit. You should turn on the server now if you have not yet. Once it is up and running it will start counting up the little KB number. Click into the “screen” section and wait for the Gigabyte logo to show up. Hit DEL and go into the bios. Set everything to defaults and then save and close. When it reboots enter the BIOS again. This time we are going to change some settings. First specify your boot drive. You can leave this as UEFI if you want, it doesn’t really matter but Legacy mode is less headaches potentially if you have a drive issue.</p>
<p>Here are the settings you are going to hunt down and change.</p>
<ul>
<li>NPS to 1</li>
<li>CCD to Auto</li>
<li>SMT turn off</li>
<li>SVM off (or on if you are running in proxmox/virtualizing, minor performance hit)</li>
<li>IOMMU off (or on if you are running in proxmox/virtualizing, minor performance hit)</li>
<li>cTDP adjusted to 200 (for 7702)</li>
<li>deterministic control manual, then slider is performance</li>
<li>quick power policy performance</li>
<li>BoostFMax manual</li>
<li>boostFmax 3400 (for 7702)</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally after you have made these changes save and reboot once again from the bios. This time hit the F12/11/10 (I forget, it shows on the bootlogo page bottom) to enter the bios boot selection. Select the AMI virtual CD option. If you are on wired it should get you to the Ubuntu boot screen fast. Go ahead and install. Set a username and password you will not forget. Ensure you check the box that says “setup ssh server” so you can remote in once it is installed. It will install. It will reboot and you have to hit enter to proceed at the end. When it finishes rebooting it should be back to a terminal asking for your user: enter your username and password. type </p><p> and remember your ip address. You can now go back to your terminal software in windows/osx/linux on your desktop and close the HTML5 viewer. In window in your terminal replacing with your info type:</p>

<h4>Install additional software packages</h4>
<p>Here is a blob of cmds to run. I am omitting the GPU stuff but if you have NVIDIA GPUs then you can at the end of this go install those</p>
<div snippet-height="">
                
                <pre><code id="dm-code-raw">
<pre>sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt upgrade -y &amp;&amp; sudo apt install -y htop git glances nano lsof unzip</pre>
</code></pre></div>
<h4>Set a static IP address</h4>
<p>From the CLI type:</p>

<p>Then you will have a default config you can edit by using</p>
<div snippet-height="">
                
                <pre><code id="dm-code-raw">
<pre>sudo nano /etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml</pre>
</code></pre></div>
<p>It will look like this originally. We will be editing eno1. That is the physical RJ-45 network plug on the motherboard. Ignore my enp65s0np0 that is an add in network card.</p>
<p><a href="https://digitalspaceport.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-29-201629.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://digitalspaceport.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-29-201629.png" alt="" width="527" height="270" srcset="https://digitalspaceport.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-29-201629.png 527w, https://digitalspaceport.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-29-201629-300x154.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 527px) 100vw, 527px"></a></p>
<p>Use the arrow keys and type it up to look something like this. Just use whatever IP address you are already on to make it easy for now and to not complicate things. Im using 200 as my static IP in this instance and my router is on 192.168.1.1 which is common.</p>
<p><a href="https://digitalspaceport.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-29-202330.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://digitalspaceport.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-29-202330.png" alt="" width="522" height="299" srcset="https://digitalspaceport.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-29-202330.png 973w, https://digitalspaceport.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-29-202330-300x172.png 300w, https://digitalspaceport.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-29-202330-768x440.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 522px) 100vw, 522px"></a></p>
<p>Now we have to save this netplan type CTRL-X and then Y</p>
<p>Now you will exit back to the terminal. Type</p>

<p>and you now have your network set to static. You can reboot and ssh in again to make sure now.</p>
<h3>Install Ollama</h3>
<p>Next we will install OIlama</p>
<div snippet-height="">
                
                <pre><code id="dm-code-raw">
<pre>curl -L https://ollama.com/download/ollama-linux-amd64.tgz -o ollama-linux-amd64.tgz
sudo tar -C /usr -xzf ollama-linux-amd64.tgz
sudo useradd -r -s /bin/false -U -m -d /usr/share/ollama ollama
sudo usermod -a -G ollama $(whoami)</pre>
</code></pre></div>
<p>This creates a Ollama user also and installs the ollama into /usr/share/ollama folder. FYI by default Models will live in /usr/share/ollama/.ollama/models/</p>
<h4>Setup Environment Variables and Service</h4>
<p>Now we need to setup some env variables that will run when ollama starts up. This is critical to getting the parallel issue resolved.</p>
<div snippet-height="">
                
                <pre><code id="dm-code-raw">
<pre>sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/ollama.service</pre>
</code></pre></div>
<p>and in we will be adding additional lines with environment variables. Here is a list of all the variables. We will NOT be using them all just a quick reference to what they are.</p>
<p>Environment Variables:<br>
-OLLAMA_DEBUG Show additional debug information (e.g. OLLAMA_DEBUG=1)<br>
-OLLAMA_HOST IP Address for the ollama server (default 127.0.0.1:11434)<br>
-OLLAMA_KEEP_ALIVE The duration that models stay loaded in memory (default “5m”)<br>
-OLLAMA_MAX_LOADED_MODELS Maximum number of loaded models per GPU<br>
-OLLAMA_MAX_QUEUE Maximum number of queued requests<br>
-OLLAMA_MODELS The path to the models directory<br>
-OLLAMA_NUM_PARALLEL Maximum number of parallel requests<br>
-OLLAMA_NOPRUNE Do not prune model blobs on startup<br>
-OLLAMA_ORIGINS A comma separated list of allowed origins<br>
-OLLAMA_SCHED_SPREAD Always schedule model across all GPUs</p>
<p>-OLLAMA_FLASH_ATTENTION Enabled flash attention<br>
-OLLAMA_KV_CACHE_TYPE Quantization type for the K/V cache (default: f16)<br>
-OLLAMA_LLM_LIBRARY Set LLM library to bypass autodetection<br>
-OLLAMA_GPU_OVERHEAD Reserve a portion of VRAM per GPU (bytes)<br>
-OLLAMA_LOAD_TIMEOUT How long to allow model loads to stall before giving up (default “5m”)</p>
<p>Here is what mine looks like after setting this up. You <strong>DO NOT</strong> need (nor want) to enter the GPU variables in unless you have GPUs.</p>
<p><a href="https://digitalspaceport.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-29-203725.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://digitalspaceport.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-29-203725.png" alt="" width="716" height="528" srcset="https://digitalspaceport.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-29-203725.png 1071w, https://digitalspaceport.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-29-203725-300x221.png 300w, https://digitalspaceport.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-29-203725-1024x754.png 1024w, https://digitalspaceport.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-29-203725-768x566.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 716px) 100vw, 716px"></a></p>
<p>CNTRL-X and Y to save. You then need to type:</p>
<div snippet-height="">
                
                <pre><code id="dm-code-raw">
<pre>sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl start ollama
nproc</pre>
</code></pre></div>
<p>and you are now variable wise looking good. nproc should have output the number 64. If it put out 128 you need to disable SMT. If it put out 32 or 96 you need to check your NPS and CCD settings. If it is 64, LFG.</p>
<h4>Pull down Deepseek 671b model</h4>
<p>Now lets pull the ollama guff deepseek 671b down. This will eat up like 400GB of disk space. I hope your NVMe is decent.</p>
<div snippet-height="">
                
                <pre><code id="dm-code-raw">
<pre>ollama pull deepseek-r1:671b</pre>
</code></pre></div>
<p>That will take a while. Take a moment to think of that egress bill…</p>
<h3>Install OpenWEBUI</h3>
<p>We need to run this in either docker or in python. I will deploy this for you in docker here. Ensure we dont have garbage installed that will conflict.</p>
<div snippet-height="">
                
                <pre><code id="dm-code-raw">
<pre>for pkg in docker.io docker-doc docker-compose docker-compose-v2 podman-docker containerd runc; do sudo apt-get remove $pkg; done</pre>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Install Docker Repo</p>
<div snippet-height="">
                
                <pre><code id="dm-code-raw">
<pre># Add Docker's official GPG key:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc

# Add the repository to Apt sources:
echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(. /etc/os-release &amp;&amp; echo "$VERSION_CODENAME") stable" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list &gt; /dev/null
sudo apt-get update</pre>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Install Docker Itself finally</p>
<div snippet-height="">
                
                <pre><code id="dm-code-raw">
<pre>sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin -y</pre>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Install Dockge Docker Container Manager.</p>
<p>Your data dir is inside /opt/dockge in this instance for docker and dockge, an easy to use interface.</p>
<div snippet-height="">
                
                <pre><code id="dm-code-raw"><br>
sudo mkdir -p /opt/stacks /opt/dockge<br>
cd /opt/dockge<br>
sudo curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/louislam/dockge/master/compose.yaml –output compose.yaml<br>
docker compose up -d<br>
</code></pre>
			</div>
<p>Now you can go to your docker manager to complete the rest of the steps. If you do not know the IP address of the LXC check your networking settings for the container. Then append :5001</p>
<p>http://192.168.1.200:5001 for instance is my address. You will need to set a username and password on the first visit. Please write this down. Now you are ready to start creating your docker container for OpenwebUI.</p>
<p>Paste this in as your compose for your openwebui </p>
<div snippet-height="">
                
                <pre><code id="dm-code-raw"><br>
version: “3.3”<br>
services:<br>
  open-webui:<br>
    ports:<br>
      – 7000:8080<br>
    volumes:<br>
      – open-webui:/app/backend/data<br>
    container_name: open-webui<br>
    restart: always<br>
    image: ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:latest<br>
volumes:<br>
  open-webui: {}<br>
networks:<br>
  dockge_default:<br>
    external: true<br>
</code></pre>
			</div>
<p>Hit save and run. It will pull this down on the first time and you can in the future click update to update it easy. After this shows as running, browse to the IP:7000 for your machine. Mine is http://192.168.1.200:7000 in this instance. It will have you setup credentials. Again make good note of these. We are ALMOST done now! Whew! </p>
<h4>Connect OpenWEBUI to Ollama</h4>
<p>Use the + in the /admin/settings view for connections to add the local server. In this instance it is 192.168.1.200:11434 but use your values. It should give you a green popin thing “connection success”</p>

<p>Change the GPU to 0 if you have none attached.<br>
Reasoning Effort low (medium and high are also options, medium default)<br>
Context Length 16364 (16K fits, but higher needs either more RAM or GPUs)<br>
num_thread 62 (I leave a few free)<br>
use_mlock you might want to enable to prevent ram paging to disk</p>
<p>and the rest you can play with or pull from the model card. You CAN’T use the full ~160K context size unless you have like 2 TB RAM…and it would be slower, like, a lot slower.</p>
<p>DON’T FORGET TO HIT SAVE!</p>
<h4>Set User Settings</h4>
<p>You can update your user preferences how you want, but set the the keep alive to like 3h. Hit save.</p>

<h4>Run a Test</h4>
<p>Holy cow you got here! Nice job, I am impressed! Click new chat in the upper left of the window. Deepseek-r1:671b should be there already. Give it a hello. Nice job!</p>
<h2>Benchmarking Deepseek R1 671b</h2>
<p>In conclusion, we installed a fully functional bare metal Ollama + OpenWEBUI setup. I am SURE there are a lot of other great runners out there like llama.cpp, exo, and vLLM but those will be separate guides when I get a decent handle on working them. Llama.cpp is likely first as I have done a compile, bench and run recently and it all worked out very nice! Lot of knobs on that one. vLLM is a mess of a thing and exo is simple but keeps crashing after I start it. No time to debug those things yet, but as they say…. SOON!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><small><time datetime="2025-01-31T00:00:00.000Z">Jan 31, 2025</time></small></p><p>Libraries have been trying to collect humanity’s knowledge almost since the invention of writing. In the digital age, it might actually be possible to create a comprehensive collection of all human writing that meets certain criteria. That’s what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_library">shadow libraries</a> do - collect and share as many books as possible.</p><p>One shadow library, Anna’s Archive (which I will not link here directly due to copyright concerns), recently posed a question: <em>How could we effectively visualize 100,000,000 books or more at once?</em> There’s lots of data to view: Titles, authors, which countries the books come from, which publishers, how old they are, how many libraries hold them, whether they are available digitally, etc.</p><p>International Standard Book Numbers (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISBN">ISBNs</a>) are 13-digit numbers that are assigned to almost all published books. Since the first three digits are fixed (currently only <code>978-</code> and <code>979-</code>) and the last digit is a checksum, this means <b>the total ISBN13-Space only has two billion slots</b>. Here is my interactive visualization of that space:</p><p><a href="https://phiresky.github.io/isbn-visualization/" target="_blank">Click here to view the visualization in full screen (esp.&nbsp;on mobile)</a>.</p><p>You can choose a few different datasets, look for individual books, filter by publication year, and even create a custom visualization based on multiple datasets using custom shaders. If you zoom in all the way, you get a nice bookshelf-like representation.</p><p>Here’s how I did it.</p><h2 id="the-inherent-structure-of-isbns">The inherent structure of ISBNs</h2><p>The <code>978-</code>/<code>979-</code> prefix of an ISBN comes from the fact that ISBN13s are a subset of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Article_Number">European Article Numbers</a>, which have a three-digit prefix. This fixed prefix is affectionately called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookland">Bookland</a>. We can thus ignore it almost completely.</p><p>Large blocks of 10k to 100 million ISBNs are assigned by the <em>International ISBN Agency</em> to international organizations. Then, each country has their own method of subdividing their blocks into publishers.</p><p>The important part is that ISBN blocks are always assigned by <b>prefix</b>. For example, <code>978-4</code> is assigned to Japan, and Japan assigned <code>978-4-312</code> to one publisher. That publisher then assigns the articles <code>000000-99999</code>, leading to an ISBN of <code>978-4-312-99999-X</code>, where X is a checksum. The longer the country prefix is, the fewer books can be assigned within it. For example, while Japan has a space of 100 million ISBNs, Singapore has a prefix of <code>978-9971-</code>, allowing only 100 thousand ISBNs.</p><h3 id="space-filling-curves">Space-filling curves</h3><p>When you strip ISBNs of their pre-and suffix, they are a single decimal number between 0 and 2 billion. We need some way to project this one-dimensional space into a two-dimensional space. The easiest way would be to simply fill pixels row-wise from the top, which results in an image like this:</p><figure><img src="https://phiresky.github.io/blog/2025/visualizing-all-books-in-isbn-space/oclc_isbns_smaller.png" title=""><figcaption>ISBN-Space presented linearly. Whiter pixels contain more books. You can see the line-stretched structure.</figcaption></figure><p>The issue with this is that smaller regions are stretched more and more horizontally, at the extreme a region is 1000 pixels wide and 1 pixel high. This makes it hard to see the inherent structure of ISBNs.</p><p>Thus, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42652577">as people on Hacker News discussed</a>, a better way to fill an image is using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-filling_curve">space-filling curve</a>.</p><p>The commonly suggested Hilbert-curve is nice, but it leads to artifacts:</p><figure><img src="https://phiresky.github.io/blog/2025/visualizing-all-books-in-isbn-space/hilbert.png" title=""><figcaption>Left: a Hilbert curve. Right: ISBN-space projected into a hilbert curve. You can see that the regions look like they have spatial structure, but this is purely an artifact of the curve used. (credit: Wikipedia, Hypha A)</figcaption></figure><p>While the Hilbert curve helps make regions more <span>"<!-- -->square<!-- -->"</span> (smaller regions do not get wider and wider), it introduces structure where there is none. Since structures that are not actually part of data are a huge issue in data visualization, we want to avoid this.</p><h3 id="the-bookshelf-curve">The <span>"<!-- -->Bookshelf<!-- -->"</span>-Curve</h3><p>ISBNs are inherently decimal, and we can use this to create a space-filling curve that is both simple to implement, easy to understand, and visually appealing:</p><figure><img src="https://phiresky.github.io/blog/2025/visualizing-all-books-in-isbn-space/bookshelf-curve.drawio.svg" title=""><figcaption>The space-filling curve I call <span>"<!-- -->Bookshelf-Curve<!-- -->"</span> because each second layer looks like an upright bookshelf, and each other layer like a stack of books.</figcaption></figure><p>The first decimal layer contains the digits 0-9 next to each other, the next one has them on top of each other, recursively.

In this case, I subtracted 1800 from the publication year to get a range of 1800 to 2055 in 8 bits. The red channel contains the average publication year of each book in the pixel, the blue channel contains the ratio of books present (e.g.&nbsp;if 50% of books exist, blue channel would be 127/255).</p><p>At the maximum zoom level on the other hand, I decided to map exactly 1 book to 1 pixel for accuracy:</p><figure><img src="https://phiresky.github.io/blog/2025/visualizing-all-books-in-isbn-space/full-zoom.png" title=""><figcaption>Zoom level 4 (1 book = 1 pixel) and zoom level 3</figcaption></figure><h2 id="shaders">Shaders</h2><p>Originally I stored RGB data directly in the map tiles, but in order to increase the flexibility I decided to store more abstract data, and do the actual rendering on the GPU using GLSL fragment shaders. This has a few advantages:</p><ul><li>Color scheme can be chosen later</li><li>We can apply arbitrary transformations or filters that update instantly</li><li>We can combine multiple datasets on the fly</li></ul><p>For example, let’s take the publisher dataset.

</span><span></span><span>}</span><span>;</span></code></pre><p>I had lots of performance problems initially with rendering a lot of text this way. I spent a lot of time trying and failing to render text into images/canvas in JS without having to implement my own text wrapping and layouting engine. The best approach was to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/25760896/2639190">embed the HTML as a <code>&lt;foreignObject /&gt;</code> within an SVG</a>, then render that to a canvas using <code>drawImage</code>, then converting that to an image and loading it as a texture.</p><p>This works, but it caused <code>20ms</code> lags every time, synchronously in the rendering process. I struggled to move this to a WebWorker, but it turns out <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/79196371/2639190">it’s impossible to draw an SVG in a WebWorker</a>.</p><p>After all this frustrating effort, it turns out I could fix most of my performance concerns by just reducing the HTML elements, limiting DOM content added per frame, and especially removing a stack of <code>text-shadow</code> CSS filters, which are apparently horrible for performance.</p><h2 id="barcodes">Barcodes</h2><p>At max zoom, you will also notice that each book has a barcode. I mainly added these to reinforce the concept of what we are looking at: Books ordered by ISBN. I started with some libraries to render bar codes, but it turns out there’s actually a TTF font that just renders a 13-digit number as a barcode! It even calculates the check digit itself: <a href="https://graphicore.github.io/librebarcode/">https://graphicore.github.io/librebarcode/</a>. Pretty convenient, and performant too, due to all the optimization OSs do for text rendering.</p><h2 id="publisher-ranges">Publisher ranges</h2><p>Each <span>"<!-- -->group<!-- -->"</span> (usually countries) has a large range, and each publisher has a smaller range within a group. I decided to visualize this using randomly assigned colors unique for each group and publisher:</p><figure><img src="https://phiresky.github.io/blog/2025/visualizing-all-books-in-isbn-space/publishers.png" title=""><figcaption>Looking at publishers shows their range size. If a publisher has multiple ranges the color is the same.</figcaption></figure><p>In order to allow highlighting all ranges of a publisher simultaneously, I simply give each publisher a unique ID and store this as the RGB components:</p><pre><code><span>ivec4</span><span> data </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>getIntegerRGB</span><span>(</span><span>texture2D</span><span>(</span><span>$dataset_publishers</span><span>,</span><span> vUv</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span>

</span><span></span><span>}</span></code></pre><p>This part I’m not extremely happy with. The publisher colors clash with the heatmap color scale, and country ranges are hard to see.</p><h2 id="flight">Flight</h2><p>If you search for a book or click on the minimap, you will fly there. Calculating a good looking flight path is actually much trickier than it seems. I’m not sure how Google Earth does it. After getting a mediocre result by fitting a parabola, I nerd sniped a friend of mine to get him to do it, here’s what he said:</p><blockquote><p><span>"<!-- -->Somehow you’re pretending reality is polar coordinates and converting that to cartesian coordinates?<!-- -->"</span> - <span>"<!-- -->Yes it transforms the points into a space which has the property that for a certain zoom level (which you potentially can’t reach at all) all coordinates lie on one point but all ground points are still the same distance away… aka a semicircle (or less) where the edge of the circle has the xy points zoomed in at maximum… in other words, a space that represents the speed and spatiality of the original space in one… in which the direct route is then theoretically the fastest route…. Unfortunately, this only applies if the increase in speed depends linearly on the zoom level…. but this is not the case with normal zooming… there it is rather quadratic… so every zoom level further up makes you move twice as fast to the right left… but this somehow results in a strange non-linear space with strange properties and I haven’t managed to define a distance metric in there, let alone the shortest path between two points<!-- -->"</span></p><p>– my friend rambling about calculating flight paths</p></blockquote><figure><img src="https://phiresky.github.io/blog/2025/visualizing-all-books-in-isbn-space/blub-space.png" title=""><figcaption>Blub-space transformation for smooth flight paths. This is what he sent me to try and explain it.</figcaption></figure><p>The end result isn’t perfect and it feels a bit overengineered at 500 lines of code, but it works better than my original approach.</p><h2 id="architecture">Architecture</h2><h3 id="backend">Backend</h3><p>Since we can just store our image tiles as PNG and our data trees as JSON, we don’t need any backend! We just need a static file host, like Github Pages to dump some HTML, JS, CSS, PNG, and JSON.</p><h3 id="frontend">Frontend</h3><p>I used ThreeJS, React, MobX. This is a very comfortable combination to create reactive declarative GPU-accelerated 2D/3D-scenes, with easy reusability of components. I can recommend it.</p><h3 id="processing-scripts">Processing Scripts</h3><p>There’s a set of processing scripts, mostly written in JS (directly writing out JSON and PNG files), but one of them written in Rust since it has to read in a 250GByte source file, writing output to SQLite.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>We now have a very flexible way of visualizing all books that have been published with an ISBN. I enjoyed working on this project a lot. In the end, it was made possible by what would in software be called a bad choice - using an identifier that can only barely fit enough elements. If you tried the same with UUIDs, you’d have purely vast emptiness ;)</p><p>The source code is available at <a href="https://github.com/phiresky/isbn-visualization">https://github.com/phiresky/isbn-visualization</a>.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>Over 200 companies in the UK have started a four-day working week without reducing salaries. These companies include marketing agencies, IT firms, consultancies, and charity organizations, together employing more than 5,000 people. This trend is growing in popularity, even as big companies <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/12/17/return-to-office-lease-agreements-rent-elon-musk/" data-type="link" data-id="https://fortune.com/2024/12/17/return-to-office-lease-agreements-rent-elon-musk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">push their employees to return to the office</a> full-time.</p>















<p>Marketing and press relations firms account for 30 of the companies adopting this policy. Charities, non-governmental organizations, and social care companies make up 29. There are 24 companies in technology, IT, and software, and 22 companies in business, consulting, and management offering four-day weeks to their workers.</p>

<p>Overconfident developers that choose to write their own cryptography code have plagued the information security industry since before it was <em>even an industry</em>.</p>



<p>This in and of itself isn’t inherently a bad thing, despite the infosec truisms about <em>never doing exactly that</em>. Writing crypto code (but not deploying or publishing it!) is <a href="https://www.cryptofails.com/post/75204435608/write-crypto-code-dont-publish-it" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an important first step to understanding the algorithms</a>.</p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> If you haven’t already read the article I linked just now, please stop and do so before continuing.</p>



<p>Quite a few people have posted angry responses to a different argument I’m <em>not even making here</em> because they seem to have missed this prominently placed hyperlink, and consequently assumed a different stance than the one I’m actually taking.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>One trend I’ve noticed (as I <a href="https://soatok.blog/2025/01/20/session-round-2/#:~:text=On%20their%20FAQs%20page%2C%20Session%E2%80%99s%20response%20to%20%E2%80%9Care%20you%20rolling%20your%20own%20cryptography%3F%E2%80%9D%20can%20be%20abbreviated%20to%2C%20%E2%80%9CNo%2C%20we%20use%20libsodium!%E2%80%9D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently noted about Session</a>) is developers incorrectly insisting that they aren’t rolling their own crypto because they use a lower-level cryptography library.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“If you want a picture of the future, imagine developers rolling their own crypto–forever.”</p>
<cite>–if George Orwell was an applied cryptography expert</cite></blockquote>



<p>This misdeed isn’t limited to dubious apps that fork end-to-end encrypted messengers to strip off forward secrecy.</p>



<h2 id="startup-grade-crypto">Startup-Grade Cryptography</h2>



<p>Feast your eyes on, <em><a href="https://ghostarchive.org/archive/taW5z" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">How we share secrets at a fully-remote startup</a></em>–a January 2025 reprint of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240716164008/https://www.getgrist.com/blog/how-we-share-secrets-at-a-fully-remote-startup/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an earlier 2024 blog post</a> about the same cryptography code that originally <a href="https://ghostarchive.org/archive/h8Ylr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fell victim to Bleichenbacher’s 1998 Padding Oracle Attack</a> (which is possibly the oldest pitfall in real-world cryptography).</p>



<p>And, <strong>let me be very clear on this</strong>, the reason I want you to feast your eyes on this is <strong><em>NOT</em></strong> put this person on blast. They are by far not the first person to roll their own cryptography. They aren’t even the first one I’ve seen <em>this week</em>.</p>



<p>But they <em>were</em> kind enough to walk through their code and share their thoughts about what they wrote, and I think that sheds a lot of insight into how people think about cryptographic code.</p>



<p>The blog post in question starts off with a bit humility and the common refrain from security experts:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong>Don’t roll your own security</strong></p>



<p>Like many hard areas of human knowledge, security/cryptography is one where the more you know, the more you realize you don’t know.</p>
<cite><a href="https://ghostarchive.org/archive/taW5z">How we share secrets at a fully-remote startup</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>But if you scroll down a bit further, past the code and explanation, you’ll see this too:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong>Did we roll our own security?</strong></p>



<p>No, not really. Our solution uses and trusts a lot of cryptography code from good sources: Node.js, its crypto module, and the <a href="https://www.openssl.org/">OpenSSL</a> library it’s based on. These are respected, well-maintained, commonly-used open-source tools, which get plenty of attention from security researchers.</p>
<cite><a href="https://ghostarchive.org/archive/taW5z">How we share secrets at a fully-remote startup</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>Hey, this argument has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250102225433/https://getsession.org/faq#libsodium" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a very familiar structure</a>, doesn’t it?</p>



<p>The code in question is <a href="https://github.com/gristlabs/secrets.js/issues/2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">just about what you’d expect</a> from a blog post with this sort of cognitive dissonance:</p>



<ul>
<li>It first tries to <a href="https://soatok.blog/2021/01/20/please-stop-encrypting-with-rsa-directly/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">encrypt keys directly with RSA</a>.</li>



<li>If it fails, it falls back to encrypting a <em>random symmetric key</em> with RSA, and then using that key to encrypt the message… with <a href="https://www.nccgroup.com/us/research-blog/cryptopals-exploiting-cbc-padding-oracles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unauthenticated AES-CBC</a>.</li>
</ul>



<p>Oh, and did I mention that other folks tried to talk the author down from rolling their own implementation <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/1nj3wf/how_we_share_secrets_at_fully_remote" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the first time around</a> (i.e., six months ago)?</p>



<h2 id="stories-untold">Countless Stories Untold</h2>



<p>As tempting as it may be to dunk on this code or the accompanying blog post, at least they’re being open and transparent.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Care to wager how many people make similar design mistakes and ship them to production every week, without <em>any</em> oversight from the security community? </p>
</blockquote>



<p>This is the part of the blog post where I could tell any of a dozen stories that would fit very elegantly as a complementary example to that blog post from a startup co-CEO.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, all of my best work is done under NDA.</p>





<p>So, I can’t actually give you any specifics, even if I wanted to. The conversations I’ve experienced over the years would give most infosec neophytes <em>chills</em>. The only silver lining is that I, and my peers, were successful in convincing the developers in question to correct their course.</p>



<p>Here are a few highlights to chew on:</p>



<ul>
<li>I’ve seen people use <code>md5($password)</code> as their key derivation function for libsodium.</li>



<li>I’ve seen people encrypt fields in a database, and then store the decryption key right next to the ciphertext. And then, in a stunning display of brilliance, they wrote decryption logic in SQL so they could query their database over encrypted fields.</li>



<li>At least once, when reviewing an end-to-end encryption project that implemented cryptography in JavaScript intended to run in the web browser, my question of “how do you know which public key to trust?” was answered with something shaped like, “Oh, we just store those in MySQL and fetch them from the server.”</li>
</ul>



<p>When it comes to artisanal cryptography, even large tech companies aren’t impervious to the trappings of ego.</p>





<h2 id="pride-before-yolo">Pride Goeth Before YOLO</h2>



<p>My theory for why this phenomenon keeps happening is simple:</p>



<p><strong>Most people do not fundamentally understand what <em>rolling your own</em> crypto actually means.</strong></p>



<p>Their disagreement comes in layers.</p>



<h3>Misunderstood Scope</h3>



<p>Most critically, “rolling your own crypto” means spending <strong>any</strong> innovation tokens at any level of abstraction on cryptography <em>without</em> adequate assurance of correctness and/or peer review from cryptography experts (preferably ones with at least some experience breaking other implementations).</p>



<p>The admonishment isn’t limited to <a href="https://soatok.blog/2021/02/09/crackpot-cryptography-and-security-theater/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Crystalline guy</a>!</p>



<p>Just because you outsource your block cipher implementations to your programming language’s <code>crypto</code> module doesn’t mean you’re not rolling your own crypto.</p>



<p>Cryptography doesn’t just exist at the primitive layer. Any protocols that use cryptography are, in fact, crypto! This is both radioactive and hazmat.</p>



<h3>What Even Is “Your Own” Crypto?</h3>



<p>The other big miss from this oft-repeated phrase is: what exactly <em>your own</em> crypto?</p>



<p>Does working with a team obviate the “ownness” of this act?</p>



<p>Is the problem as simple as novelty? Surely not.</p>



<p>If it were as simple as that, adhering to standards would be safe. So why do so many JSON Web Tokens implementations make terrible mistakes?</p>



<h3>There Will Be Tiers</h3>



<p>In my humble opinion, there are multiple layers of this onion: The deeper you slice, the more you will cry.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Writing UI code that wraps libsignal to ship E2EE isn’t novel</strong>, but you still want to get your code reviewed by someone with experience with attacking cryptography before you deploy it anywhere.</li>



<li>Writing your own <strong>implementation of standard cryptography protocols?</strong> That’s a little novel. Proceed with caution.</li>



<li><strong>Designing your own cryptography protocol</strong> on top of standard cryptography libraries? This is <em>way</em> more novel than you think it is.</li>



<li><strong>Developing your own cryptography library</strong> out of standard constructions of cryptographic algorithms? Unless you’re already an expert, this is dangerous territory.</li>



<li><strong>Novel constructions</strong> of cryptographic algorithms (like I did informally <a href="https://soatok.blog/2022/12/21/extending-the-aes-gcm-nonce-without-nightmare-fuel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in this blog post</a>)? You’re already in too deep.</li>



<li><strong>Alternatives to cryptographic algorithms</strong>? Whoa, slow down.</li>



<li><strong>Competing ideas to the foundational mathematics used by modern cryptography?</strong> Unless you have already pierced all the preceding layers successfully, and demonstrated attacks against standards that exist at every corresponding layer, you are probably being a crackpot.</li>
</ul>



<p>When you hear an infosec person say, “Don’t roll your own crypto,” it isn’t immediately clear where they draw the line.</p>







<p>Fundamentally, I believe the core problem here is a lack of available and trustworthy cryptography tools for developers to use.</p>



<p>Whatever opinion you have about OpenSSL, you have to acknowledge it’s a “everything but the kitchen sink”, low-level cryptography library. </p>



<p>“I use OpenSSL” is not sufficient to implement, say, <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9420.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Messaging Layer Security (RFC 9420)</a> and also declare you didn’t roll your own crypto.</p>



<p>Tink and libsodium are closer to the ideal, but fall short of being complete, off-the-shelf implementations of high-level protocols for developers to plug into their applications.</p>



<p>Even when cryptography nerds take action, historically, they’ve focused on the easy problems (wrapping standard AEADs with asymmetric cryptography), rather than addressing the harder problems. </p>



<p>Namely: Key management.</p>



<p><strong>This is why I focused on key management first</strong> for <a href="https://soatok.blog/category/technology/open-source/fediverse-e2ee-project/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">my Fediverse E2EE project</a>. I’m not even thinking about the actual end-to-end encryption logic again until the key management story is sorted. </p>



<p>Looking at the available tooling to developers offered by their programming languages and package manager ecosystems of open source software, everyone else seems to kick that fucking can down the road–hoping it will be someone else’s problem.</p>



<h3 id="my-hell">Welcome To My Hell</h3>



<p>While I work to deliver a solid, reliable solution to the key management problem for my own end-to-end encryption design, overconfident developers the world over are rolling their own encryption–often while insisting they aren’t doing that.</p>





<p>To err is to be human, but to routinely make preventable mistakes because people with my exact skillset haven’t yet delivered easy-to-use, hard-to-misuse tooling in the programming languages actual developers use–meeting them where they are, as it were?</p>



<p><strong>That’s frustration on a level that would make</strong><br><strong>eldritch horrors quiver in rage.</strong></p>



<p>And that’s not to say I’m anything special. <a href="https://soatok.blog/2024/09/09/doesnt-matter/">I’m definitely not.</a> But there are many, many people who can do everything I can (except they can do more), and yet this problem persists, as if to spite me.</p>



<p>I can’t help but feel responsible every time someone screws up, despite knowing that my betters (for which there are assuredly many) haven’t succeeded either. I’m not going to give up, but it is very disheartening.</p>



<p>If those who study history are doomed to stand by helplessly while everyone else repeats it, then watching developers reinvent the same vulnerabilities is my curse as a cryptography nerd.</p>





<h2 id="addendum-2025-02-01">Addendum (2025-02-01)</h2>



<p>This post unexpectedly blew up on Reddit / Hacker News / etc. and a few people posted a comment that can be summed up as “What tools should I use?” or “How should I learn this stuff?”</p>



<p>The good news is, I already wrote both of those blog posts before. To wit:</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://soatok.blog/2024/11/15/what-to-use-instead-of-pgp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>What To Use Instead of PGP</em></a> details specific cryptographic software to use in order to solve specific use cases.</li>



<li><em><a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/06/10/how-to-learn-cryptography-as-a-programmer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">How to Learn Cryptography As A Programmer</a></em> is an introduction to many of the resources you need to level up on understanding cryptography if you already have a background in software development.</li>
</ul>



<p>In fact, I’ve written a lot of <a href="https://soatok.blog/tag/security-guidance/">security guidance</a> on this very blog. A lot of the questions raised in the comments section of news aggregators about this blog post are already well-answered by my previous blog posts, but I will eventually get rate-limited for spamming replies with links to my past writing. (So, please, take some time and peruse the topics I’ve already covered before asking in a public forum.)</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>[This post is adapted from our forthcoming book, <em>Preserving Government Information: Past, Present, and Future</em>.]</p>
<p>Today we want to clarify something important about preserving government information. There is a difference between the government changing a policy and the government erasing information, but the line between those two has blurred in the digital age.</p>
<p>When a new president is inaugurated, one expects new policies. The number of changes and the speed of change may vary for different administrations, but we expect that every administration will be different in some ways from its predecessor. After all, that is part of the reason we have elections. Also, information that the government publishes is updated all the time, not just when administrations change. Laws and regulations are added and amended and rescinded, new economic and environmental and census data are collected and published, government recommendations to the public (like the Department of Agriculture’s “food pyramid” guidance) are revised. </p>
<p>Changes in government information are normal in a democracy.</p>
<p>Because change is normal, it is essential to preserve government information – even “non-current” and “out of date” information – in order to document those changes. This is not a new idea, but a long-accepted principle of democracy. Citizens need a record of what a government’s stated values were and when they changed, what actions it took and when it took them, what data it collected and generated at specific points in time, and so forth. It is important to preserve even information that later proves to be inaccurate in order to document what the government knew and when it knew it. </p>
<p>Because published government information is the evidence for a democracy, its preservation is essential.</p>
<p>In the era in which government information was published in paper formats, preservation of that information relied on libraries. The information was distributed to FDLP libraries based on the needs of the communities that those libraries served. Beginning in 1962, Regional FDLs received and retained all the paper publications in the FDLP system. When new information superseded or replaced old information, the old information was not erased or discarded; it was preserved in Regional FDLs and in every FDL whose community valued that older information. In the print era, it was taken for granted that, once government information was released to the public, it would not be withdrawn or altered or lost.<sup><a id="return1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> </p>
<p>In the digital age, government publishing has shifted from the distribution of unalterable printed books to digital posts on government websites. Such digital publications can be moved, altered, and withdrawn at the flick of a switch. Publishing agencies are not required to preserve their own information, nor to provide free access to it. </p>
<p>Some digital government information is actively preserved by GPO, NARA, and the Library of Congress. Some government-collected data are preserved by law or by tradition. But the laws that allow this are weak and government preservation of government information suffers from large gaps. Non-government projects (notably the <a href="https://archive.org/">Internet Archive</a> and the <a href="https://eotarchive.org/">End-of-Term Archive</a>) use web harvesting to attempt to acquire and store government information, but these projects are, by their nature, incomplete and their long-term guarantees of access are fragile. As a result of all this, the public can no longer assume that any given piece of government information will not be withdrawn or altered or lost. </p>
<p>The early actions of the incoming Trump administration (as well as the actions of the first Trump administration) have brought the vulnerability of digital information to the public’s attention (see our previous post “<a href="https://freegovinfo.info/node/14744/">Federal information scrubbing has begun</a>”) and the public is rightfully worried. That vulnerability is, however, not limited to this administration. Digital government information was being lost before President Trump. </p>
<p>The current crisis of imminent loss of information exists not only because government information is being changed, but because it is being erased. The erasure is possible because of the gaps in the current preservation infrastructure. </p>
<p>The scale of loss and alteration of information under Trump may prove to be unprecedented and certainly requires immediate short-term action. But librarians and archivists and citizens should use this current crisis to demand more than short-term solutions. A new distributed digital preservation infrastructure is needed for digital government information.</p>
