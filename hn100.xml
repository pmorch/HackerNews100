Apple Accounts for users under 18 would need to join a Family Sharing group, with new controls available for parents and restrictions for minors.</p>
<p>In a preliminary injunction that delays the implementation of the act, Judge Robert Pitman said that it violates the First Amendment and is "more likely than not unconstitutional."<br>
</p>
<blockquote><p>The Act is akin to a law that would require every bookstore to verify the age of every customer at the door and, for minors, require parental consent before the child or teen could enter and again when they try to purchase a book. As set out below, the Court finds a likelihood that, when considered on the merits, SB 2420 violates the First Amendment.</p></blockquote>
<p>The injunction was in response to a motion filed by the Computer and Communications Industry Association (CCIA), a group that includes Apple and Google. Today's decision is a win for Apple, as Apple has been fighting against age assurance requirements in Texas and other states. Apple says that the Texas law impacts user privacy.<br>
</p>
<blockquote><p>While we share the goal of strengthening kids' online safety, we are concerned that SB2420 impacts the privacy of users by requiring the collection of sensitive, personally identifiable information to download any app, even if a user simply wants to check the weather or sports scores.</p></blockquote>
<p>The court will move on to determining whether the law is facially invalid, which would mean that it is unconstitutional and will be entirely thrown out.</p>

            <guid>46369923</guid>
            <pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 21:54:30 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://github.com/freelawproject/x-ray">https://github.com/freelawproject/x-ray</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46369923">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><article itemprop="text"><p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/freelawproject/x-ray/main/redacted.png"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/freelawproject/x-ray/main/redacted.png" alt="Image of REDACTED STAMP"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">x-ray is a Python library for finding bad redactions in PDF documents.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Why?</h2><a id="user-content-why" aria-label="Permalink: Why?" href="#why"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">At Free Law Project, we collect millions of PDFs. An ongoing problem
is that people fail to properly redact things. Instead of doing it the right
way, they just draw a black rectangle or a black highlight on top of black
text and call it a day. Well, when that happens you just select the text under
the rectangle, and you can read it again. Not great.</p>
<p dir="auto">After witnessing this problem for years, we decided it would be good to figure
out how common it is, so, with some help, we built this simple tool. You give
the tool the path to a PDF. It tells you if it has worthless redactions in it.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">What next?</h2><a id="user-content-what-next" aria-label="Permalink: What next?" href="#what-next"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Right now, <code>x-ray</code> works pretty well and we are using it to analyze documents
in our collections. It could be better though. Bad redactions take many forms.
See the issues tab for other examples we don't yet support. We'd love your
help solving some of tougher cases.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Installation</h2><a id="user-content-installation" aria-label="Permalink: Installation" href="#installation"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">With uv, do:</p>

<p dir="auto">With pip, that'd be:</p>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Usage</h2><a id="user-content-usage" aria-label="Permalink: Usage" href="#usage"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><code>uvx</code> lets you run this without even installing it. For example, here's an amicus brief we filed that doesn't have any bad redactions:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="uvx --from x-ray xray https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ca3.125346/gov.uscourts.ca3.125346.45.0.pdf
{}"><pre><code>uvx --from x-ray xray https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ca3.125346/gov.uscourts.ca3.125346.45.0.pdf
{}
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Once you <em>do</em> install x-ray, you can easily use it on the command line. Once installed, just:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="% xray path/to/your/file.pdf
{
  &quot;1&quot;: [
    {
      &quot;bbox&quot;: [
        58.550079345703125,
        72.19873046875,
        75.65007781982422,
        739.3987426757812
      ],
      &quot;text&quot;: &quot;The Ring travels by way of Cirith Ungol&quot;
    }
  ]
}"><pre>% xray path/to/your/file.pdf
{
  <span><span>"</span>1<span>"</span></span>: [
    {
      <span><span>"</span>bbox<span>"</span></span>: [
        58.550079345703125,
        72.19873046875,
        75.65007781982422,
        739.3987426757812
      ],
      <span><span>"</span>text<span>"</span></span>: <span><span>"</span>The Ring travels by way of Cirith Ungol<span>"</span></span>
    }
  ]
}</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Or if you have the file on a server somewhere, give it a URL. If it starts with <code>https://</code>, it will be interpreted as a PDF to download. Here's congressional testimony our directory made (it doesn't have any bad redactions):</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="% xray https://free.law/pdf/congressional-testimony-michael-lissner-free-law-project-hearing-on-ethics-and-transparency-2021-10-26.pdf
{}"><pre>% xray https://free.law/pdf/congressional-testimony-michael-lissner-free-law-project-hearing-on-ethics-and-transparency-2021-10-26.pdf
{}</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">A fun trick you can do is to make a file with one URL per line, call it <code>urls.txt</code>. Then you can run this to check each URL:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="xargs -n 1 xray  < urls.txt"><pre>xargs -n 1 xray  <span>&lt;</span> urls.txt</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">However you run <code>xray</code> on the command line, you'll get JSON as output. When you have that, you can use it with tools like <a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/" rel="nofollow"><code>jq</code></a>. The format is as follows:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>It's a dict.</li>
<li>The keys are page numbers.</li>
<li>Each page number maps to a list of dicts.</li>
<li>Each of those dicts maps to two keys.</li>
<li>The first key is <code>bbox</code>. This is a four-tuple that indicates the x,y positions of the upper left corner and then lower right corners of the bad redaction.</li>
<li>The second key is <code>text</code>. This is the text under the bad rectangle.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Simple enough.</p>
<p dir="auto">You can also use it as a Python module, if you prefer the long-form:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="% python -m xray some-file.pdf"><pre><code>% python -m xray some-file.pdf
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">But that's not as easy to remember.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you want a bit more, you can, of course, use <code>xray</code> in Python:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="from pprint import pprint
import xray
bad_redactions = xray.inspect(&quot;some/path/to/your/file.pdf&quot;)  # Pathlib works too
pprint(bad_redactions)
{1: [{'bbox': (58.550079345703125,
               72.19873046875,
               75.65007781982422,
               739.3987426757812),
      'text': 'Aragorn is the one true king.'}]}"><pre><span>from</span> <span>pprint</span> <span>import</span> <span>pprint</span>
<span>import</span> <span>xray</span>
<span>bad_redactions</span> <span>=</span> <span>xray</span>.<span>inspect</span>(<span>"some/path/to/your/file.pdf"</span>)  <span># Pathlib works too</span>
<span>pprint</span>(<span>bad_redactions</span>)
{<span>1</span>: [{<span>'bbox'</span>: (<span>58.550079345703125</span>,
               <span>72.19873046875</span>,
               <span>75.65007781982422</span>,
               <span>739.3987426757812</span>),
      <span>'text'</span>: <span>'Aragorn is the one true king.'</span>}]}</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">The output is the same as above, except it's a Python object, not a JSON object.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you already have the file contents as a <code>bytes</code> object, that'll work too:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="some_bytes = requests.get(&quot;https://lotr-secrets.com/some-doc.pdf&quot;).content
bad_redactions = xray.inspect(some_bytes)"><pre><span>some_bytes</span> <span>=</span> <span>requests</span>.<span>get</span>(<span>"https://lotr-secrets.com/some-doc.pdf"</span>).<span>content</span>
<span>bad_redactions</span> <span>=</span> <span>xray</span>.<span>inspect</span>(<span>some_bytes</span>)</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Note that because the <code>inspect</code> method uses the same signature no matter what,
the type of the object you give it is essential:</p>
<markdown-accessiblity-table><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Input</th>
<th><code>xray</code>'s Assumption</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>str</code> or Pathlib <code>Path</code></td>
<td>local file</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>str</code> that starts with <code>https://</code></td>
<td>URL to download</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>bytes</code></td>
<td>PDF in memory</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></markdown-accessiblity-table>
<p dir="auto">This means that if you provide the filename on disk as a bytes object instead
of a <code>str</code>, it's not going to work. This will fail:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="xray.inspect(b&quot;some-file-path.pdf&quot;)"><pre><span>xray</span>.<span>inspect</span>(<span>b"some-file-path.pdf"</span>)</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">That's pretty much it. There are no configuration files or other variables to
learn. You give it a file name. If there is a bad redaction in it, you'll soon
find out.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How it works</h2><a id="user-content-how-it-works" aria-label="Permalink: How it works" href="#how-it-works"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Under the covers, <code>xray</code> uses the high-performant <a href="https://pymupdf.readthedocs.io/" rel="nofollow">PyMuPDF project</a> to parse PDFs. It has been a wonderful project to work with.</p>
<p dir="auto">You can read the source to see how it works, but the general idea is to:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">Find rectangles in a PDF.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Find letters in the same location</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Render the rectangle as an image</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Inspect the rectangle to see if it's all one color. If it is, then that's a
bad redaction. If not, then we assume you can see a mix of text and
drawings, indicating a redaction that's OK.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">The PDF format is a big and complicated one, so it's difficult to do all this perfectly. We do our best, but there's always more to do to make it better. <a href="https://free.law/donate/" rel="nofollow">Donations</a> and sponsored work help.</p>

HTTP. HTTPS. Port 443. That’s it. That’s the list.</p><p>You know what enterprise networks hate?</p><ul><li><p><strong>UDP</strong><span> — Blocked. Deprioritized. Dropped. “Security risk.”</span></p></li><li><p><strong>WebRTC</strong><span> — Requires TURN servers, which requires UDP, which is blocked</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Custom ports</strong><span> — Firewall says no</span></p></li><li><p><strong>STUN/ICE</strong><span> — NAT traversal? In </span><em>my</em><span> corporate network? Absolutely not</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Literally anything fun</strong><span> — Denied by policy</span></p></li></ul><p>We tried WebRTC first. Worked great in dev. Worked great in our cloud. Deployed to an enterprise customer.</p><p>“The video doesn’t connect.”</p><p><em>checks network</em><span> — Outbound UDP blocked. TURN server unreachable. ICE negotiation failing.</span></p><p>We could fight this. Set up TURN servers. Configure enterprise proxies. Work with IT departments.</p><p><span>Or we could accept reality: </span><strong>Everything must go through HTTPS on port 443.</strong></p><p><span>So we built a </span><strong>pure WebSocket video pipeline</strong><span>:</span></p><ul><li><p>H.264 encoding via GStreamer + VA-API (hardware acceleration, baby)</p></li><li><p>Binary frames over WebSocket (L7 only, works through any proxy)</p></li><li><p>WebCodecs API for hardware decoding in the browser</p></li><li><p>60fps at 40Mbps with sub-100ms latency</p></li></ul><p>We were so proud. We wrote Rust. We wrote TypeScript. We implemented our own binary protocol. We measured things in microseconds.</p><p><strong>Then someone tried to use it from a coffee shop.</strong></p><p>“The video is frozen.”</p><p>“Your WiFi is bad.”</p><p>“No, the video is definitely frozen. And now my keyboard isn’t working.”</p><p><em>checks the video</em></p><p>It’s showing what the AI was doing 30 seconds ago. And the delay is growing.</p><p>Turns out, 40Mbps video streams don’t appreciate 200ms+ network latency. Who knew.</p><p>When the network gets congested:</p><ol><li><p>Frames buffer up in the TCP/WebSocket layer</p></li><li><p>They arrive in-order (thanks TCP!) but increasingly delayed</p></li><li><p>Video falls further and further behind real-time</p></li><li><p>You’re watching the AI type code from 45 seconds ago</p></li><li><p>By the time you see a bug, the AI has already committed it to main</p></li><li><p>Everything is terrible forever</p></li></ol><p><span>“Just lower the bitrate,” you say. Great idea. Now it’s 10Mbps of blocky garbage that’s </span><em>still</em><span> 30 seconds behind.</span></p><p>We tried everything:</p><p><strong>“What if we only send keyframes?”</strong></p><p>This was our big brain moment. H.264 keyframes (IDR frames) are self-contained. No dependencies on previous frames. Just drop all the P-frames on the server side, send only keyframes, get ~1fps of corruption-free video. Perfect for low-bandwidth fallback!</p><p><span>We added a </span><code>keyframes_only</code><span> flag. We modified the video decoder to check </span><code>FrameType::Idr</code><span>. We set GOP to 60 (one keyframe per second at 60fps). We tested.</span></p><p>We got exactly ONE frame.</p><p>One single, beautiful, 1080p IDR frame. Then silence. Forever.</p><pre><code><code>[WebSocket] Keyframe received (frame 121), sending
[WebSocket] ...
[WebSocket] ...
[WebSocket] It's been 14 seconds why is nothing else coming
[WebSocket] Failed to send audio frame: Closed</code></code></pre><p><em>checks Wolf logs</em><span> — encoder still running</span></p><p><em>checks GStreamer pipeline</em><span> — frames being produced</span></p><p><em>checks Moonlight protocol layer</em><span> — </span><strong>nothing coming through</strong></p><p><span>We’re using </span><a href="https://games-on-whales.github.io/wolf/stable/" rel="">Wolf</a><span>, an excellent open-source game streaming server (seriously, the documentation is great). But our WebSocket streaming layer sits on top of the Moonlight protocol, which is reverse-engineered from NVIDIA GameStream. Somewhere in that protocol stack, </span><em>something</em><span> decides that if you’re not consuming P-frames, you’re not ready for more frames. Period.</span></p><p>We poked around for an hour or two, but without diving deep into the Moonlight protocol internals, we weren’t going to fix this. The protocol wanted all its frames, or no frames at all.</p><p><strong>“What if we implement proper congestion control?”</strong></p><p><em>looks at TCP congestion control literature</em></p><p><em>closes tab</em></p><p><strong>“What if we just... don’t have bad WiFi?”</strong></p><p><em>stares at enterprise firewall that’s throttling everything</em></p><p>One late night, while debugging why the stream was frozen again, I opened our screenshot debugging endpoint in a browser tab:</p><pre><code><code>GET /api/v1/external-agents/abc123/screenshot?format=jpeg&amp;quality=70</code></code></pre><p>The image loaded instantly.</p><p>A pristine, 150KB JPEG of the remote desktop. Crystal clear. No artifacts. No waiting for keyframes. No decoder state. Just... pixels.</p><p>I refreshed. Another instant image.</p><p>I mashed F5 like a degenerate. 5 FPS of perfect screenshots.</p><p>I looked at my beautiful WebCodecs pipeline. I looked at the JPEGs. I looked at the WebCodecs pipeline again.</p><p>No.</p><p>No, we are not doing this.</p><p>We are professionals. We implement proper video codecs. We don’t spam HTTP requests for individual frames like it’s 2009.</p><p>typescript</p><pre><code><code>// Poll screenshots as fast as possible (capped at 10 FPS max)
const fetchScreenshot = async () =&gt; {
  const response = await fetch(`/api/v1/external-agents/${sessionId}/screenshot`)
  const blob = await response.blob()
  screenshotImg.src = URL.createObjectURL(blob)
  setTimeout(fetchScreenshot, 100) // yolo
}</code></code></pre><p>We did it. We’re sending JPEGs.</p><p><span>And you know what? </span><strong>It works perfectly.</strong></p><p>Here’s the thing about our fancy H.264 pipeline:</p><p><span>PropertyH.264 StreamJPEG SpamBandwidth40 Mbps (constant)100-500 Kbps (varies with complexity)StateStateful (corrupt = dead)Stateless (each frame independent)Latency sensitivityVery highDoesn’t careRecovery from packet lossWait for keyframe (seconds)Next frame (100ms)Implementation complexity3 months of Rust</span><code>fetch()</code><span> in a loop</span></p><p><span>A JPEG screenshot is </span><strong>self-contained</strong><span>. It either arrives complete, or it doesn’t. There’s no “partial decode.” There’s no “waiting for the next keyframe.” There’s no “decoder state corruption.”</span></p><p>When the network is bad, you get... fewer JPEGs. That’s it. The ones that arrive are perfect.</p><p><span>And the size! A 70% quality JPEG of a 1080p desktop is like </span><strong>100-150KB</strong><span>. A single H.264 keyframe is 200-500KB. We’re sending LESS data per frame AND getting better reliability.</span></p><p><span>We didn’t throw away the H.264 pipeline. We’re not </span><em>complete</em><span> animals.</span></p><p>Instead, we built adaptive switching:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Good connection</strong><span> (RTT &lt; 150ms): Full 60fps H.264, hardware decoded, buttery smooth</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Bad connection detected</strong><span>: Pause video, switch to screenshot polling</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Connection recovers</strong><span>: User clicks to retry video</span></p></li></ol><p><span>The key insight: </span><strong>we still need the WebSocket for input</strong><span>.</span></p><p>Keyboard and mouse events are tiny. Like, 10 bytes each. The WebSocket handles those perfectly even on a garbage connection. We just needed to stop sending the massive video frames.</p><p>So we added one control message:</p><p>json</p><pre><code><code>{"set_video_enabled": false}</code></code></pre><p>Server receives this, stops sending video frames. Client polls screenshots instead. Input keeps flowing. Everyone’s happy.</p><p>15 lines of Rust. I am not joking.</p><p>rust</p><pre><code><code>if !video_enabled.load(Ordering::Relaxed) {
    continue; // skip frame, it's screenshot time baby
}</code></code></pre><p>We almost shipped a hilarious bug.</p><p>When you stop sending video frames, the WebSocket becomes basically empty. Just tiny input events and occasional pings.</p><p><strong>The latency drops dramatically.</strong></p><p>Our adaptive mode sees low latency and thinks: “Oh nice! Connection recovered! Let’s switch back to video!”</p><p>Video resumes. 40Mbps floods the connection. Latency spikes. Mode switches to screenshots.</p><p>Latency drops. Mode switches to video.</p><p>Latency spikes. Mode switches to screenshots.</p><p><strong>Forever. Every 2 seconds.</strong></p><p><span>The fix was embarrassingly simple: once you fall back to screenshots, </span><strong>stay there until the user explicitly clicks to retry</strong><span>.</span></p><p>typescript</p><pre><code><code>setAdaptiveLockedToScreenshots(true) // no oscillation for you
```

We show an amber icon and a message: "Video paused to save bandwidth. Click to retry."

Problem solved. User is in control. No infinite loops.

## Ubuntu Doesn't Ship JPEG Support in grim Because Of Course It Doesn't

Oh, you thought we were done? Cute.

`grim` is a Wayland screenshot tool. Perfect for our needs. Supports JPEG output for smaller files.

Except Ubuntu compiles it without libjpeg.
```
$ grim -t jpeg screenshot.jpg
error: jpeg support disabled</code></code></pre><p><em>incredible</em></p><p>So now our Dockerfile has a build stage that compiles grim from source:</p><p>dockerfile</p><pre><code><code>FROM ubuntu:25.04 AS grim-build
RUN apt-get install -y meson ninja-build libjpeg-turbo8-dev ...
RUN git clone https://git.sr.ht/~emersion/grim &amp;&amp; \
    meson setup build -Djpeg=enabled &amp;&amp; \
    ninja -C build
```

We're building a screenshot tool from source so we can send JPEGs in 2025. This is fine.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/Meta-SCX-LAVD-Steam-Deck-Server">https://www.phoronix.com/news/Meta-SCX-LAVD-Steam-Deck-Server</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46366998">Hacker News</a></p>

<p><img alt="LINUX KERNEL" src="https://www.phoronix.com/assets/categories/linuxkernel.webp" width="100" height="100"></p><p>
An interesting anecdote from this month's Linux Plumbers Conference in Tokyo is that Meta (Facebook) is using the Linux scheduler originally designed for the needs of Valve's Steam Deck... On Meta Servers. Meta has found that the scheduler can actually adapt and work very well on the hyperscaler's large servers.
</p><p>
SCX-LAVD as the Latency-criticality Aware Virtual Deadline scheduler has <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/LAVD-Scheduler-Linux-Gaming">worked out very well for the needs of Valve's Steam Deck</a> with similar or better performance than <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/search/EEVDF">EEVDF</a>. SCX-LAVD has been worked on by Linux consulting firm Igalia under contract for Valve. SCX-LAVD has also seen varying use by the CachyOS Handheld Edition, Bazzite, and other Linux gaming software initiatives.
</p><p><a href="https://www.phoronix.com/image-viewer.php?id=2025&amp;image=meta_lavd_1_lrg" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=2025&amp;image=meta_lavd_1_med" alt="Steam Deck and Server"></a></p>
<p>It turns out that besides working well on handhelds, SCX-LAVD can also end up working well on large servers too. The presentation at LPC 2025 by Meta engineers was in fact titled "<em>How do we make a Steam Deck scheduler work on large servers</em>." At Meta they have explored SCX_LAVD as a "default" fleet scheduler for their servers that works for a range of hardware and use-cases for where they don't need any specialized scheduler.
</p><p><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=2025&amp;image=meta_lavd_2_med" alt="Meta SCX LAVD"></p>
<p>They call this scheduler built atop sched_ext as "Meta's New Default Scheduler". LAVD they found to work well across the growing CPU and memory configurations of their servers, nice load balancing between CCX/LLC boundaries, and more.

            <p>AI <em>is</em> making formal verification go mainstream.</p>
<p>AI-assisted mechnical proving companies are raising funds on billion dollar <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/robinhood-ceos-math-focused-ai-startup-harmonic-valued-145-billion-latest-2025-11-25/">valuations</a>, new people are trying proof assistants,
overwhelmingly Lean, at unprecedented rates. Models achieve fascinating results in competitions previously considered to contain
some of the hardest problems in the world, such as IMO, ICPC, Putnam; as well as open problems in mathematics such as Erdös Problems.
It's not just the hobbyists that are excited about AI-assisted proofs, from <a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/machine-jan-3.pdf">Terry Tao</a>, to <a href="https://martin.kleppmann.com/2025/12/08/ai-formal-verification.html">Martin Kleppman</a>, to <a href="https://x.com/ilyasergey/status/1989053674552004749">Ilya Sergey</a>, prominent researchers around the world are excited and hopeful about the effects.</p>
<h2 id="formal-verification-the-goods"><a href="#formal-verification-the-goods" aria-label="Anchor link for: formal-verification-the-goods">Formal Verification: The Goods</a></h2>
<p>Let me quickly give you a run down of the argument:</p>
<p>There are multiple complex challenges in formal verification. The first one, and the one that is very hard to solve technically,
is that most software in the world does not have a formal specification. A formal specification is a simpler mathematical description
of the system we build. Algorithms have formal specifications. Data structures, protocols, data formats, safety-critical systems typically
have formal specifications. The majority of the programs in the world doesn't have a formal specification, hell, most of them don't even have
informal specifications. At the limit, which is where we actually are, the specification of a program is itself, the implementation is the
specification. The lack of a formal specification makes it very hard to formally verify some piece of software, because what would you even
verify?</p>
<p>The second issue is, proof engineering, the practice of writing proofs for theorems about your systems, is very hard. The proofs have many domain
specific elements to them, a proof of a mathematical theorem will be very different from a proof about a programming language, and a proof about the programming
language will highly depend on the underlying constructs of its theoretical framework. The widest taught proof engineering book
is <a href="https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/">Software Foundations</a>, and every chapter has a different style of proofs. Someone that went through
Volume 2: Programming Language Foundations will not find the problems in Volume 6: Separation Logic Foundations intuitive or obvious. There are other problems
such as the tooling for proof automation, brittleness of proofs, reusability of proofs etc. but I don't find them particularly fundamental to proof engineering
itself but rather problems of the current generation, so we can leave those aside for now.</p>
<p>The rise of LLMs in programming vastly affects both of these points. It affects point number 1 because AI-assisted programming is a very natural fit
fot specification-driven development. AI-assisted programming pushes the limits of programming from what you can implement to what you can specify and
what you can <a href="https://alperenkeles.com/posts/verifiability-is-the-limit/">verify</a>. This is a great incentive for writing executable specifications,
because then you can put the LLM inside a loop until it achieves the said objective, irrespective of the means of the achievement.
<a href="https://alperenkeles.com/posts/verifiable-abstractions/">I predict that</a> this will give rise to program optimizers and translators that will
be transformative of our work in those domains. However, tests are, as infamously they are, incomplete. Tests are great at finding bugs (actually
they are not so great most of the time, but that's another discussion), but they <strong>cannot</strong> prove the absence of bugs. SQLite famously has
millions of tests, but researchers still find bugs in SQLite, similar situations arise in almost all software.</p>
<p>The only way to prove the absence of bugs is formal verification, and industry has seen great examples of this. Highly cited formal verification
projects include CompCert C Compiler, <a href="https://users.cs.utah.edu/~regehr/papers/pldi11-preprint.pdf">the random testing of which against GCC and Clang</a>
has led to finding 79 bugs in GCC and 202 bugs in Clang, and only 2 bugs in CompCert in its <em>unverified</em> parser, finding no bugs in its verified compilation
pass, a striking win for formal verification. (Thanks to <a href="https://emptysqua.re/blog/">A. Jesse Jiryu Davis</a> informing me, I learned that researchers have
<a href="https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/pfonseca/papers/eurosys2017-dsbugs.pdf">studied</a> the source of failures in formally verified distributed systems, and
found that wrong assumptions about the unverified parts of the system are the likely culprit.)</p>
<p>This makes formal verification a prime target for AI-assisted programming. Given that we have a formal specification, we can just let the machine wander around
for hours, days, even weeks. If it comes back with a solution, we shall trust not to the probabilistic predictions of the so-called artificial intelligence,
but the symbolic proof checker that verifies the solution. This idea has always been at the core of formal verification, the ability to have unsound proof
generation coupled with sound proof checking has given rise to complex tactics, algorithms that produce proofs by searching them, to enable proof engineers
in great capacity.</p>
<p>This is not the end of the good news. AI is also very good at writing proofs, at least much better than the average software engineer. Given that we have
a perfect oracle, we can also turn the problem into an RLVR (Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards), which means we should expect the models to get
even better at it as time goes on as they did in chess, go, and many other similar problems. This is the promise behind the billion dollar valuations,
the companies started with impressive autoformalization techniques and automated provers for tackling competition problems and open conjectures, but
the real industrial value is at the core of automating software engineering by letting the engineer write a verbal description, autoformalized into a Lean
theorem, proven by the automated prover, and voila, we have our program that we can fully trust.</p>
<p><em>or do we?</em></p>
<h2 id="formal-verification-the-bads"><a href="#formal-verification-the-bads" aria-label="Anchor link for: formal-verification-the-bads">Formal Verification: The Bads</a></h2>
<p>I see the appeal, I like the idea, I trust the researchers building these systems, but I don't love the overarching promises. This blog post
is my attempt at building a reasonable middle ground by laying out the goods (as I already did), and the bads (as I now will), and make my closing
remarks by reiterating the position of testing in this space, and in the future.</p>
<h3 id="autoformalization-is-a-shaky-ground"><a href="#autoformalization-is-a-shaky-ground" aria-label="Anchor link for: autoformalization-is-a-shaky-ground">Autoformalization is a shaky ground</a></h3>
<p>I started this post by stating most programs in the world do not have formal specifications, followed by how AI is incentivizing us to write specifications,
and autoformalization takes the specifications, and makes them <strong>formal</strong>. In formal verification, there's this concept of a <em>trusted computing base (TCB)</em>. TCB
is your Achilles' Heel, it's the bottom of the ladder, where layers over layers of verification is built on, trusting a small core without verifying it, because
there must be a bottom of the ladder, we cannot build a circular verification argument, and the system cannot verify itself. (please fact check me on this
if I'm wrong, which is possible)</p>
<p>Autoformalization is part of the TCB in this AI-assisted verified programming paradigm, because one cannot mechanically verify that the verbally stated
specification indeed corresponds to the formalized one. There are several modes of usage, one issue is soundness, there might be mechanically verified scenarios
that would be rejected by the verbal specification. Another issue is completeness, the formalized model might reject valid scenarios in our descriptions.
Autoformalization part of the process requires and deserves our special attention as it's one of the crucial points of failure in this verification process.</p>
<h3 id="proof-assistants-are-slow"><a href="#proof-assistants-are-slow" aria-label="Anchor link for: proof-assistants-are-slow">Proof assistants are slow</a></h3>
<p>In a proof assistant, the primary goal is reasoning about programs and ease of verification. For instance, proof assistants, traditionally, don't use our classic
two's complement integers packed into words in our memory, they use Peano numbers, an encoding of natural numbers as inductive data structures:</p>
<pre data-lang="lean"><code data-lang="lean"><span>Inductive Nat : Type :=
</span><span>| zero : Nat
</span><span>| succ : Nat -&gt; Nat.
</span></code></pre>
<p>This encoding doesn't possess the concept of an integer overflow. Its inductive structure allows us to build theorems that hold for all natural numbers, not
just the ones that can fit in a word. It is also painfully slow, the computational complexity of <code>a + b</code>, an operation so fast in CPU that it's literally
an instant, is <code>O(a + b)</code>, addition is linear in time to the added values instead of a constant operation. However, we would like to run verified code on
real life workloads, so we cannot wait for a million cycles to add 1M + 1M = 2M. There are 2 solutions to this problem, the first one is that you build a
more efficient encoding in the proof assistant, prove equivalence of the efficient but hard to reason encoding to the inefficient but simpler to reason one,
and use the efficient one in your computations. The other is once again, axiomatization, or broadening the TCB. Proof assistants offer a mechanism called
<strong>extraction</strong> that allows for extracting a piece of code in the language of the proof assistant (e.g Rocq) to a language with a larger ecosystem optimized
for running production workloads (e.g OCaml). Much of the extraction is a one-to-one correspondence between the languages via syntactic transformations,
but we can hijack the extraction to axiomatize our own types. We can turn Nat into unsigned integers, where <code>Nat.add</code> becomes <code>u64 + u64</code>. For instance,
in Rocq, Nats are extracted to BigInts, which should have the same semantics, but the "should" in this sentence carries the heavyweight. Without an accompanying
proof of correctness, we just put BigInt into the TCB.</p>
<p>Without broadening the TCB, the speed of a proof assistant will be limited by the large amount of pointer chasing that arises naturally with the use of
inductive types and their tree-inducing characteristics. There are many domains in which speed isn't that big of a deal, but I think there's also a
concern between speed and the requirement for correctness, as faster code tends to involve more complex language constructs such as concurrency,
bit manipulation, layout awareness, which leads to more bugs than their simpler counterparts. If we cannot reason about programs that are more likely
to have bugs, how much of the overarching problem are we tackling?</p>
<h3 id="verification-requires-models-and-models-are-very-hard-to-come-by"><a href="#verification-requires-models-and-models-are-very-hard-to-come-by" aria-label="Anchor link for: verification-requires-models-and-models-are-very-hard-to-come-by">Verification requires models, and models are very hard to come by</a></h3>
<p>In order to verify some property of a system, one needs a model of the system. These models don't grow on trees, they are crafted by domain
experts over a number of years. People have been building models for programs with pointers (separation logic), as well as programs with
concurrency, programs with randomness, programs with algebraic effects, and perhaps many more that I haven't even heard of. In proving a property
of the system, we need a foundation for our reasoning process, which these theories give us for their respective domains. However, there are many
domains we don't have good models for, one example is runtime performance. This has been a contentious issue in the computer science curriculum, the
asymptotic complexity does not translate to program behavior in real hardware. Modern CPUs have cache lines, speculative execution, branch prediction
that makes the plain old abstract machine used in asymptotical analysis obsolete for many scenarios. We do not even have a single hardware to conform
our model to, we have tens of different configurations of hardware, each of which will give different results in our measurements. If we tried to prove
that some piece of code has a better result for a specific memory/processor pair than another one, we would have a massive job on our hands, I personally
don't even know where I would start with.</p>
<p>Contrast this to testing, where you can just spin up the same algorithm on both machines, run our benchmarks, which will be our final ground truth. Testing
is almost universally considered inferior to formal verification, it is what you do when you don't have the resources to justify verification, because if you
had the opportunity to spend the time, proving absence of bugs, or universal facts about your system, would be much more valuable than codifiying the results
of singular measurements. I am here to tell you that there are tests we can write that could not be formally verified, because while building the underlying
models for verification might be hard, just using the real hardware for our measurements can be much easier.</p>
<h3 id="verification-doesn-t-tell-you-that-you-are-going-down-the-wrong-path"><a href="#verification-doesn-t-tell-you-that-you-are-going-down-the-wrong-path" aria-label="Anchor link for: verification-doesn-t-tell-you-that-you-are-going-down-the-wrong-path">Verification doesn't tell you that you are going down the wrong path</a></h3>
<p>In games, there are clear winners and losers. In verification, you can prove that your theorem is correct, you can prove that your theorem is incorrect, but
absence of a proof for a theorem does not imply that the theorem is incorrect, it is possible that you just haven't found the proof. This means the feedback
you get when writing a proof is limited as you cannot rely on your inability to progress as a signal about your theorem, it is plausible that you are the problem.
This is why QuickChick, a testing tool descending from the famous QuickCheck of Haskell that introduced Property-Based Testing to the world, exists in Rocq
ecosystem as one of the three most popular packages. If verification was strictly superior to testing, QuickChick would have no reason to exist, but it serves
a very crucial role that the verification process needs, <strong>falsification</strong>. I had said that the absence of a proof does not imply that a theorem is wrong, but the witness of a violation of the theorem definitely does. Random testing is the prime suspect for finding such counterexamples, pulling the verifier out of the
rabbit hole of going through many useless paths in the proof search before giving up, because the theorem is ultimately wrong, there is no proof to be found.</p>
<h2 id="random-testing-and-formal-verification"><a href="#random-testing-and-formal-verification" aria-label="Anchor link for: random-testing-and-formal-verification">Random Testing and Formal Verification</a></h2>
<p>I have given examples of tests that formal verification is incapable of modeling, and examples of tests that complement formal verification process by creating
a short that falsifies false theorems instead of trying to prove them in vain. The synergy between testing and formal verification doesn't end here, I am a firm
supporter of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/lean-into-verified-software-development/">Verification-Guided Development (VGD)</a>, which in addition to leveraging this synergy, solves the problem of proof
assistants being too slow. In verification
guided development, we implement two versions of the same system, one is the simpler to reason, verified version, the other is the complex, production one. We then
test the property that the production system conforms to the reference implementation that is verified by running them with the same inputs and asserting that
the result is the same every single time. VGD <em>lifts</em> the proof to the production implementation from the slower one implemented in the proof assistant by leveraging
differential random testing, which allows for building a best-of-both-worlds system that is both correct and fast. Below is an image taken from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01688">the paper</a>
that (as far as I know) introduced the notion of VGD, explaining their workflow.</p>
<p><img src="https://alperenkeles.com/posts/test-dont-verify/image.png" alt="cedar vgd"></p>
<p>VGD doesn't solve all the issues I mention in the rest of the post, but it removes the slowness out of the mix. As we have a production implementation ready to be tested thoroughly,
we can make all kinds of measurements that fall out of the purview of verification, but into the realm of testing. It levels the playing field between the verified realm of computing
and the unverified one, reducing the downsides of the verification leveraging testing.</p>

<p>I would like to state it once more for everyone:</p>
<p><strong>I see the appeal, I like the idea, I trust the researchers building these systems, but I don't love the overarching promises. This blog post
is my attempt at building a reasonable middle ground by laying out the goods, and the bads, and make my closing
remarks by reiterating the position of testing in this space, and in the future.</strong></p>
<p>I believe random testing plays as important of a role as formal verification in the future of software engineering. We will not have magically formally verified systems
in many domains, but as autoformalization tools get better, we will have many, many more formal specifications. Random testing benefits from these formal specifications
in different ways than formal verification, but both have their places. Proof systems will be incomplete without the accompanying testing tools, and the testing tools
will be incomplete without proofs of correctness, it is only possible via some combination of verification and testing that we can achieve our ideals of the future of
software engineering, live in a world where bugs are considered anomalies instead of the norm, where correctness is a virtue, and the bugs in our systems are as old and
as forgotten as the diseases we learned to cure and put away.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p>Ryanair has been fined €256m (£223m) by Italy’s competition authority for abusing its dominant market position to limit sales of tickets by online travel agents.</p><p>The authority said Europe’s largest airline had “implemented an abusive strategy to hinder travel agencies” via an “elaborate strategy” of technical obstacles for agents and passengers to make it difficult for online travel agents to sell Ryanair tickets and instead force sales through its own website.</p><p>The fine related to Ryanair’s conduct between April 2023 and at least until April 2025, the authority said on Tuesday. It said Ryanair had prevented online travel agents from selling tickets on its flights in combination with other airlines and services, weakening competition.</p><p>Ryanair said it would immediately appeal against the “legally flawed” ruling.</p><p>The Ryanair chief executive, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/michael-oleary" data-link-name="in body link">Michael O’Leary</a>, had decided to wage war on what he <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/29/ryanair-cuts-profits-forecast-flights-lastminute-opodo" data-link-name="in body link">described as “pirate” travel agents</a>, such as Booking.com, Kiwi and Kayak. O’Leary accused the travel agent industry of scamming and ripping off unsuspecting consumers by charging extra fees and markups on ticket prices.</p><p>O’Leary was prepared to accept lower ticket sales as he tried to prevent travel agents from selling tickets, forcing their passengers to fill out extra forms supposedly as a security measure. The abrupt removal of Ryanair flights from agents’ websites in late 2023 <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/03/ryanair-ticket-sales-hit-after-travel-agent-websites-delist-airline" data-link-name="in body link">caused a drop in sales for the airline</a>.</p><p>The lower sales <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/29/ryanair-cuts-profits-forecast-flights-lastminute-opodo" data-link-name="in body link">dented Ryanair’s profits</a>, although they have not prevented the Irish airline from rising to a record valuation of €31bn (£27bn). That has made it the world’s second most valuable airline, behind only the US’s Delta Air Lines.</p><p>O’Leary – who is known for his combative and often sweary criticisms of airports, rivals and regulators – is planning to hand over control of the business to a successor within the next five to 10 years. He will be <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/dec/18/ryanair-boss-michael-oleary-heads-for-100m-bonus" data-link-name="in body link">given shares worth €111m</a> (£97m) if he stays at the airline until the end of July 2028. He was already a billionaire on paper because of his shareholding.</p><p>Responding to the ruling, O’Leary said it was “an affront to consumer protection and competition law”.</p><p>He added: “The internet and the ryanair.com website have enabled Ryanair to distribute directly to consumers, and Ryanair has passed on these 20% cost savings in the form of the lowest air fares in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/italy" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Italy</a> and Europe.</p><p>“Ryanair looks forward to successfully overturning this legally flawed ruling and its absurd €256m fine in the courts.”</p><figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement"><gu-island name="EmailSignUpWrapper" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props="{&quot;index&quot;:11,&quot;listId&quot;:4139,&quot;identityName&quot;:&quot;business-today&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Business Today&quot;,&quot;frequency&quot;:&quot;Every weekday&quot;,&quot;successDescription&quot;:&quot;We'll send you Business Today every weekday&quot;,&quot;theme&quot;:&quot;news&quot;,&quot;idApiUrl&quot;:&quot;https://idapi.theguardian.com&quot;}"></gu-island></figure><p>The vast majority of Ryanair’s sales took place through its website even before the battle against online travel agents. However, the Italian authority said Ryanair had been guilty of “abuse of a dominant position” and using its “significant market power” in trying to stamp out the business.</p><p>Ryanair’s tactics included rolling out facial recognition procedures for people who bought tickets via a third party, claiming that was necessary for security. It then “totally or intermittently blocked booking attempts by travel agencies”, including by blocking payment methods and mass-deleting accounts.</p><p>The airline then “imposed partnership agreements” on agencies that banned sales of Ryanair flights in combinations with other carriers, and blocked bookings to force them to sign up. Only in April this year did it allow agencies’ websites to link up with its own services, allowing effective competition.</p><p>The competition authority said Ryanair’s actions had “blocked, hindered or made such purchases more difficult and/or economically or technically burdensome when combined with flights operated by other carriers and/or other tourism and insurance services”.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <h2 id="syntax-highlighting-in-hand-coded-websites">Syntax Highlighting in Hand-Coded Websites</h2>
<h3 id="the-problem">The problem</h3>
<p>I have been trying to identify practical reasons why hand-coding websites with HTML and CSS is so hard (<em>by hand-coding, I mean not relying on frameworks, generators or 3rd party scripts that modify the DOM</em>).</p>
<p>Let's say, I want to make a blog. What are the <strong>actual</strong> things that prevent me from making—and maintaining—it by hand? What would it take to clear these roadblocks?</p>
<p>There are many, of course, but for a hand-coded programming oriented blog one of these roadblocks is <strong>syntax highlighting</strong>.</p>
<p>When I display snippets of code, I want to make the code easy to read and understand by highlighting it with colors. To do that, I would normally need to use a complex syntax highlighter library, like <a href="https://prismjs.com/">Prism</a> or <a href="https://highlightjs.org/">highlight.js</a>. These scripts work by scanning and chopping up the code into small language-specific patterns, then wrapping each part in tags with special styling that creates the highlighted effect, and then injecting the resulting HTML back into the page.</p>
<p>But, I want to write code by hand. I don't want any external scripts to inject things I didn't write myself. Syntax highlighters also add to the overall complexity and bloat of each page, which I'm trying to avoid. I want to keep things as simple as possible.</p>
<h3 id="leveraging-opentype-features-to-build-a-simple-syntax-highlighter-inside-the-font">Leveraging OpenType features to build a simple syntax highlighter inside the font</h3>
<p>This lead me to think: <strong>could it be possible to build syntax highlighting directly into a font</strong>, skipping JavaScript altogether? Could I somehow leverage OpenType features, by creating colored glyphs with the COLR table, and identifying and substituting code syntax with contextual alternates?</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div class="spoilers"&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Yes, it's possible!&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;small&gt;...to some extent =)&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The colors in the HTML snippet above <strong>comes from within the font itself</strong>, the code is <strong>plain text</strong>, and requires <strong>no JavaScript</strong>.</p>
<p>To achieve that, I modified an open source font Monaspace Krypton to include colored versions of each character, and then used OpenType contextual alternates to essentially find &amp; replace specific strings of text based on HTML, CSS and JS syntax. The result is a simple syntax highlighter, <strong>built-in</strong> to the font itself.</p>
<p>If you want to try it yourself, download the font: <a href="https://blog.glyphdrawing.club/assets/fonts/FontWithASyntaxHighlighter-Regular.woff2">FontWithASyntaxHighlighter-Regular.woff2</a></p>
<p>And include the following bits of CSS:</p>
<pre><code>@font-face {
  font-family: 'FontWithASyntaxHighlighter';
  src: 
    url('/FontWithASyntaxHighlighter-Regular.woff2') 
    format('woff2')
  ;
}
code {
  font-family: "FontWithASyntaxHighlighter", monospace;
}
</code></pre>
<p>And that's it!</p>
<h2 id="what-are-the-pros-and-cons-of-this-method">What are the Pros and Cons of this method?</h2>
<p>This method opens up some interesting possibilities...</p>
<h3 id="pros">Pros</h3>
<ol>
<li>Install is as easy as using any custom font.</li>
<li>Works without JavaScript.</li>
<li>Works without CSS themes.</li>
<li>...but can be themed with CSS.</li>
<li>It's fast.</li>
<li>Snippets of code can be put into <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;code&gt;</code>, with no extra classes or <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>s.</li>
<li>Clean HTML source code.</li>
<li>Works everywhere that supports OpenType features, like InDesign.</li>
<li>Doesn't require maintenance or updating.</li>
<li>Works in <code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;input&gt;</code>! Syntax highlighting inside <code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code> has been <a href="https://css-tricks.com/creating-an-editable-textarea-that-supports-syntax-highlighted-code/">previously impossible</a>, because textareas and inputs can only contain plain text. This is where the interesting possibilities lie. As a demo, I made this tiny HTML, CSS &amp; JS sandbox, with native undo and redo, in a single, <a href="https://blog.glyphdrawing.club/assets/webcomponents/tinybox.js">web component</a>.</li>
</ol>
<tiny-box>
  <template>
      <style>
        .container {

          width: 100%;
          display: grid;
          place-content: center;
          background:

</tiny-box>
<h3 id="cons">Cons</h3>
<p>There are, of course, some limitations to this method. It is not a direct replacement to the more robust syntax highligting libraries, but works well enough for simple needs.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Making modifications to the syntax highligher, like adding more language supports or changing the look of the font, requires modifying the font file. This requires some knowledge of font production, which most people don't have.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It only works where OpenType is supported. Fortunately, that's all major browsers and most modern programs. However, something like PowerPoint doesn't support OpenType.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finding patterns in text with OpenType contextual alternates is quite basic, and is no match for scripts that use regular expressions. For example, words within <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tags that are JS keywords will be always highlighted: <code>&lt;p&gt;if I throw this Object through the window, catch it, for else it’ll continue to Infinity &amp; break&lt;/p&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>Multiline highlighting with manual line breaks will sadly not work.</p>
<p>This is common, for example, in comment blocks and template literals:</p>
<pre><code> &lt;!-- This line gets highlighted...
 but not this, because I made a manual line break...
 --&gt;
</code></pre>

<h2 id="how-does-it-actually-work">How does it actually work?</h2>
<p>Here's roughly how it works. There are two features in OpenType that make this possible: OpenType COLR table and contextual alternates.</p>
<h3 id="opentype-colr-table">OpenType COLR table</h3>
<p>OpenType COLR table makes multi-colored fonts possible. <a href="https://glyphsapp.com/learn/creating-a-microsoft-color-font">There is a good guide on creating a color font using Glyphs</a>.</p>
<p>I made a palette with 8 colors.</p>
<p>I duplicated letters <code>A</code> <code>–</code> <code>Z</code>, numbers <code>0</code> <code>–</code> <code>9</code> and the characters <code>.</code> <code>#</code> <code>*</code> <code>-</code> and <code>_</code> four times. Each duplicated character is then suffixed with .alt, .alt2, .alt3 or .alt4, and then assigned a color from the palette. For example, all .alt1 glyphs are <code>this</code> color.</p>
<p>I also duplicated all characters twice, and gave them suffices .alt1 and .alt5 and assigned them colors used in <code>&lt;!-- comment blocks --&gt;</code> and <code>"strings within quotes"</code></p>

    <figcaption>View from Glyps app. Each alternate character has a different color.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The two other colors I used for symbols <code>&amp; | $ + − = ~ [] () {} / ; : " @ %</code> and <code>'</code>, and they are always in one color. Numbers <code>0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9</code> are also always a certain color, unless overriden by other rules.</p>
<h3 id="opentype-contextual-alternates">OpenType contextual alternates</h3>
<p>The second required feature is OpenType contextual alternates. <a href="https://glyphsapp.com/learn/features-part-3-advanced-contextual-alternates">Here's a great introductory guide to advanced contextual alternates for Glyphs</a>.</p>
<p>Contextual alternates makes characters "aware" of their adjacent characters. An example would be fonts that emulate continuous hand writing, where <em>how</em> a letter connects depends on which letter it connects to. There is a <a href="https://ilovetypography.com/2011/04/01/engaging-contextuality/">nice article covering possible uses here</a>.</p>
<h4 id="javascript-syntax-rules">JavaScript syntax rules</h4>
<p>The core feature of contextual alternates is substituting glyphs. Here is a simplified code for finding the JavaScript keyword <code>if</code> and substituting the letters i and f with their colored variant:</p>
<pre><code>sub i' f by i.alt2;
sub i.alt2 f' by f.alt2;
</code></pre>
<p>In English:</p>
<ol>
<li>When i is followed by f, substitute the default i with an alternate (i.alt2).</li>
<li>When i.alt2 is followed by f, substitute the default f with an alternate (f.alt2).</li>
<li>As a result, every "if" in text gets substituted with <code>if</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>OpenType doesn't support many-to-many substitutions directly, but <a href="https://typo.social/@behdad/112967180363218632">@behdad</a> on Mastodon had a great suggestion: keywords could be elegantly colored by <em>chaining</em> contextual substitutions.</p>
<p>To do this, I made a lookup which substitutes each letter with its colored variant.</p>
<pre><code>lookup ALT_SUBS {
    sub a by a.alt; 
    sub b by b.alt; 
    sub c by c.alt; 
    [etc.]
    sub Y by Y.alt;
    sub Z by Z.alt;
} ALT_SUBS;
</code></pre>
<p>I moved this lookup rule to the <a href="https://handbook.glyphsapp.com/layout/standalone-lookups/">Prefix</a> section, which just means it doesn't get applied automatically unlike the other lookups.</p>
<p>Then, I made a lookup rule for each keyword in the contextual alternates section. Here's one for <code>console</code>:</p>
<pre><code>lookup console {
    ignore sub @AllLetters c' o' n' s' o' l' e';
    ignore sub c' o' n' s' o' l' e' @AllLetters;
    sub c' lookup ALT_SUBS
        o' lookup ALT_SUBS
        n' lookup ALT_SUBS
        s' lookup ALT_SUBS
        o' lookup ALT_SUBS
        l' lookup ALT_SUBS
        e' lookup ALT_SUBS;
} console;
</code></pre>
<p>First two lines tells it to ignore strings like <code>Xconsole</code> or <code>consoles</code>, but not if there's a period like <code>console.log()</code>.</p>
<p>The third line starts by replacing the first letter 'c' with its colored variant <code>c</code>, by using definitions from the other lookup table "ALT_SUBS". This repeats until each letter is replaced by its color variant, and the result is <code>console</code>.</p>
<p>Identifying JavaScript keywords is fairly straightforward. Logic is the same for each keyword, and I used a python script to generate them.</p>
<h4 id="html-and-css-syntax-rules">HTML &amp; CSS syntax rules</h4>
<p>But for HTML and CSS... I had to get a bit more creative. There are simply too many keywords for both HTML and CSS combined. Making a separate rule for each keyword would inflate the file size.</p>
<p>Instead, I came up with this monstrosity. Here's how I find CSS value functions:</p>
<pre><code>lookup CssParamCalt useExtension {

</code></pre>
<p>@CssParam is a custom OpenType glyph class I've set up. It includes the characters <code>A</code> <code>–</code> <code>Z</code>, <code>a</code> <code>–</code> <code>z</code>, and <code>-</code>, which are all the possible characters used in CSS value function names. Because the longest possible CSS value function name is <code>repeating-linear-gradient()</code>, with 25 letters, the first line of the lookup starts with @CssParam repeated 25 times, followed by parenleft (<code>(</code>). This lookup will match any word up to 25 letters long, if it's immediately followed by an opening parenthesis. When a match occurs, it substitutes the matched text with its alternate color form (@CssParamAlt4).</p>
<p>This lookup works for both CSS and JavaScript. It will colorize standard CSS functions like <code>rgb()</code> as well as custom JavaScript functions like <code>myFunction()</code>. The result is a semi-flexible syntax highlighter that doesn't require complex parsing. The downside is that if you have a really long function name, it stops working midway: <code>aReallyLongFunctionNameStopsWorkingMidway()</code>. I've repeated the same principle for finding HTML tags and attributes, and for CSS selectors and parameters.</p>
<h4 id="unknown-length-rules">Unknown length rules</h4>
<p>Comment blocks and strings between quotes also required extra care, because their length can be anything. OpenType doesn't support loops or anything resembling regular expressions. For example, I can't just tell it to simply substitute everything it finds between two quotes.</p>
<p>However, I got a great suggestion from @penteract on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41259124"><em>Hacker News</em></a> to use a finite state machine for these kinds of situations. Here our aim is to colorize eveything between /* and */ gray:</p>
<pre><code>lookup CSScomment useExtension {
  // stop if we encounter a colored */
  ignore sub asterisk.alt1 slash.alt1 @All';

  // color first letter after /*
  sub slash asterisk @All' by @AllAlt1;
  sub slash asterisk space @All' by @AllAlt1;
  
  // color /* itself
  sub slash' asterisk by slash.alt1;
  sub slash.alt1 asterisk' by asterisk.alt1;
  
  // finite state machine to color rest of the characters
  // or until ignore condition is met
  sub @AllAlt1 @All' by @AllAlt1;
} CSScomment;
</code></pre>
<p>The last line is the important one. The lookup will just continue replacing characters if the previous character is already colored.</p>
<h3 id="end-note">End note</h3>
<p>The full process is a little bit too convoluted to go into step-by-step, but if you're a type designer who wants to do this with their own font, don't hesitate to contact me.</p>
<p>I'm also not an OpenType expert, so I'm sure the substitution logics could be improved upon.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>Have you ever watched long running migration script, wondering if it's about
to wreck your data? Or wish you can "just" spin a fresh copy of database for
each test run? Or wanted to have reproducible snapshots to reset between
runs of your test suite, (and yes, because you are reading boringSQL) needed
to reset the learning environment?</p>
<p>When your database is a few megabytes, <code>pg_dump</code> and restore works fine. But
what happens when you're dealing with hundreds of megabytes/gigabytes - or more?
Suddenly "just make a copy" becomes a burden.</p>
<p>You've probably noticed that PostgreSQL connects to <code>template1</code> by default. What
you might have missed is that there's a whole templating system hiding in plain
sight. Every time you run</p>
<pre><code><span>CREATE DATABASE dbname;
</span></code></pre>
<p>PostgreSQL quietly clones standard system database <code>template1</code> behind the
scenes. Making it same as if you would use</p>
<pre><code><span>CREATE DATABASE dbname TEMPLATE template1;
</span></code></pre>
<p>The real power comes from the fact that you can replace <code>template1</code> with any
database. You can find more at <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/manage-ag-templatedbs.html">Template Database
documentation</a>.</p>
<p>In this article, we will cover a few tweaks that turn this templating system
into an instant, zero-copy database cloning machine.</p>
<h2 id="create-database-strategy">CREATE DATABASE ... STRATEGY<a href="#create-database-strategy" aria-label="Anchor link for: create-database-strategy"></a>
</h2>
<p>Before PostgreSQL 15, when you created a new database from a template, it
operated strictly on the file level. This was effective, but to make it
reliable, Postgres had to flush all pending operations to disk (using
<code>CHECKPOINT</code>) before taking a consistent snapshot. This created a massive I/O
spike - a "Checkpoint Storm" - that could stall your production traffic.</p>
<p>Version 15 of PostgreSQL introduced new parameter <code>CREATE DATABASE ... STRATEGY = [strategy]</code> and at the same time changed the default behaviour how the new
databases are created from templates. The new default become <code>WAL_LOG</code> which
copies block-by-block via the Write-Ahead Log (WAL), making I/O sequential (and
much smoother) and support for concurrency without facing latency spike. This
prevented the need to CHECKPOINT but made the database cloning operation
potentially significantly slower. For an empty <code>template1</code>, you won't notice the
difference. But if you try to clone a 500GB database using WAL_LOG, you are
going to be waiting a long time.</p>
<p>The <code>STRATEGY</code> parameter allows us to switch back to the original method
<code>FILE_COPY</code> to keep the behaviour, and speed. And since PostgreSQL 18, this
opens the whole new set of options.</p>
<h2 id="file-copy">FILE_COPY<a href="#file-copy" aria-label="Anchor link for: file-copy"></a>
</h2>
<p>Because the <code>FILE_COPY</code> strategy is a proxy to operating system file operations,
we can change how the OS handles those files.</p>
<p>When using standard file system (like <code>ext4</code>), PostgreSQL reads every byte of
the source file and writes it to a new location. It's a physical copy. However
starting with PostgreSQL 18 - <code>file_copy_method</code> gives you options to switch
that logic; while default option remains <code>copy</code>.</p>
<p>With modern filesystems (like ZFS, XFS with reflinks, APFS, etc.) you can switch
it to <code>clone</code> and leverage <code>CLONE</code> (<code>FICLONE</code> on Linux) operation for almost
instant operation. And it won't take any additional space.</p>
<p>All you have to do is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Linux with XFS or ZFS support (we will use XFS for the demostration) or similar
operating system. MacOS APFS is also fully supported. FreeBSD with ZFS also
supported (which normally would be my choice, but haven't got time to test so
far)</li>
<li>PostgreSQL cluster on that file system</li>
<li>update the configuration <code>file_copy_method = clone</code></li>
<li>and reload the configuration</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-benchmark">The benchmark<a href="#the-benchmark" aria-label="Anchor link for: the-benchmark"></a>
</h2>
<p>We need some dummy data to copy. This is the only part of the tutorial where you
have to wait. Let's generate a ~6GB database.</p>
<pre data-lang="sql"><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE DATABASE </span><span>source_db</span><span>;
</span><span>\c source_db
</span><span>
</span><span>CREATE TABLE </span><span>boring_data</span><span> (
</span><span>    id </span><span>serial PRIMARY KEY</span><span>,
</span><span>    payload </span><span>text
</span><span>);
</span><span>
</span><span>-- generate 50m rows

<p>While enabling <code>\timing</code> you can test the default (WAL_LOG) strategy. And on my
test volume (relatively slow storage) I get</p>
<pre><code><span>CREATE DATABASE slow_copy TEMPLATE source_db;
</span><span>CREATE DATABASE
</span><span>Time: 67000.615 ms (01:07.001)
</span></code></pre>
<p>Now, let's verify our configuration is set for speed:</p>
<pre><code><span>show file_copy_method;
</span><span> file_copy_method
</span><span>------------------
</span><span> clone
</span><span>(1 row)
</span></code></pre>
<p>Let's request the semi-instant clone of the same database, without taking
extra disk space at the same time.</p>
<pre><code><span>CREATE DATABASE fast_clone TEMPLATE source_db STRATEGY=FILE_COPY;
</span><span>CREATE DATABASE
</span><span>Time: 212.053 ms
</span></code></pre>
<p>That's a quite an improvement, isn't it?</p>
<h2 id="working-with-cloned-data">Working with cloned data<a href="#working-with-cloned-data" aria-label="Anchor link for: working-with-cloned-data"></a>
</h2>
<p>That was the simple part. But what is happening behind the scenes?</p>
<p>When you clone a database with <code>file_copy_method = clone</code>, PostgreSQL doesn't
duplicate any data. The filesystem creates new metadata entries that point to
the same physical blocks. Both databases share identical storage.</p>
<p>This can create some initial confusion. If you ask PostgreSQL for the size:</p>
<pre data-lang="sql"><code data-lang="sql"><span>SELECT</span><span> pg_database_size('</span><span>source_db</span><span>') as source,
</span><span>       pg_database_size('</span><span>fast_clone</span><span>') as clone;
</span></code></pre>
<p>PostgreSQL reports both as ~6GB because that's the logical size - how much data
each database "contains" - i.e. logical size.</p>
<pre><code><span>-[ RECORD 1 ]------
</span><span>source | 6594041535
</span><span>clone  | 6594041535
</span></code></pre>
<p>The interesting part happens when you start writing. PostgreSQL doesn't update
tuples in place. When you UPDATE a row, it writes a new tuple version somewhere
(often a different page entirely) and marks the old one as dead. The filesystem
doesn't care about PostgreSQL internals - it just sees writes to 8KB pages. Any
write to a shared page triggers a copy of that entire page.</p>
<p>A single UPDATE will therefore trigger copy-on-write on multiple pages:</p>
<ul>
<li>the page holding the old tuple</li>
<li>the page receiving the new tuple</li>
<li>index pages if any indexed columns changed</li>
<li>FSM and visibility map pages as PostgreSQL tracks free space</li>
</ul>
<p>And later, VACUUM touches even more pages while cleaning up dead tuples. In this
case diverging quickly from the linked storage.</p>

</h2>
<p>Using the database OID and relfilenode we can verify the both databases are now
sharing physical blocks.</p>

<p>In this case extent 0 no longer has shared flag, first 40 blocks size (with
default size 4KB) now diverge, making it total of 160KB. Each database now has
its own copy at different physical address. The remaining extents are still
shared.</p>

</h2>
<p>Cloning is tempting but there's one serious limitation you need to be aware if
you ever attempt to do it in production. The source database can't have any
active connections during cloning. This is a PostgreSQL limitation, not a
filesystem one. For production use, this usually means you create a dedicated
template database rather than cloning your live database directly. Or given the
relatively short time the operation takes you have to schedule the cloning in
times where you can temporary block/terminate all connections.</p>
<p>Other limitation is that the cloning only works within a single filesystem. If
your databases spans multiple table spaces on different mount points, cloning
will fall back to regular physical copy.</p>
<p>Finally, in most managed cloud environments (AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL), you
will not have access to the underlying filesystem to configure this. You are
stuck with their proprietary (and often billed) functionality. But for your own
VMs or bare metal? Go ahead and try it.</p>

At the same time, we executed the most ambitious engineering project in our history: <strong>a complete migration from Heroku to a custom Kubernetes cluster on AWS</strong>.</p><p>For almost ten years, managed hosting served us well — but by mid-2024, we had hit a ceiling. Costs were rising while our need for granular control grew. We realized we were paying a premium for convenience we no longer needed. It was time to build our own home.</p><p>The journey began back in October 2024, kicking off a <strong>nine-month marathon</strong>. We spent the winter prototyping (experimenting with everything from bare metal to alternative PaaS providers — some of which shall remain unnamed to protect the guilty), the spring architecting, and the early summer stress-testing.</p><p>After months of planning, we flipped the switch on Saturday, June 7th. We prepared for a battle, but we mostly ended up watching dashboards. Aside from a tiny detail that cost us exactly <strong>1 minute</strong> of downtime, the transition was flawless. By the time we turned the writes back on, every byte of data had been successfully secured in AWS.</p><p>The results were immediate and startling:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Speed:</strong> Response times for the Content Delivery API (CDA) were <strong>halved</strong> instantly.</p></li><li><p><strong>Efficiency:</strong> We are now running on <strong>64GB RAM</strong> database instances on AWS that handle traffic better than the <strong>256GB</strong> instances we used on Heroku. Yes, you read that right. Four times less RAM, better performance.</p></li></ul><p>It was a massive bet, but looking at the metrics today, it is undeniably one of the best wins of our year.</p><figure data-datocms-content-link-boundary=""> <prose-island> <img-lightbox> <a href="https://www.datocms-assets.com/205/1766150565-response-time-before-and-after-the-switch.png?auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;w=2000"><picture data-datocms-image="true">  <source srcset="https://www.datocms-assets.com/205/1766150565-response-time-before-and-after-the-switch.png?auto=format&amp;dpr=0.25&amp;w=1000 250w,https://www.datocms-assets.com/205/1766150565-response-time-before-and-after-the-switch.png?auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5&amp;w=1000 500w,https://www.datocms-assets.com/205/1766150565-response-time-before-and-after-the-switch.png?auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75&amp;w=1000 750w,https://www.datocms-assets.com/205/1766150565-response-time-before-and-after-the-switch.png?auto=format&amp;w=1000 1000w,https://www.datocms-assets.com/205/1766150565-response-time-before-and-after-the-switch.png?auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5&amp;w=1000 1500w,https://www.datocms-assets.com/205/1766150565-response-time-before-and-after-the-switch.png?auto=format&amp;dpr=2&amp;w=1000 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"> <img src="https://www.datocms-assets.com/205/1766150565-response-time-before-and-after-the-switch.png?auto=format&amp;w=1000" alt="" title="Response time, before and after the switch" loading="lazy" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-testid="img"> </picture> </a></img-lightbox>  </prose-island> <figcaption>Response time, before and after the switch</figcaption> </figure><p>We didn't just move servers and DBs; while moving our core applications to <strong>AWS EKS </strong>was the main event, we executed a total overhaul of the ecosystem surrounding it:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Infrastructure as Code:</strong> We codified our entire environment using <strong>Terraform</strong>, giving us a reproducible, version-controlled blueprint of our infrastructure that eliminates manual configuration drift.</p></li><li><p><strong>CDN Caching:</strong> We switched from Fastly to <strong>Cloudflare </strong>for our CDN cache, implementing smarter caching rules that improved our hit ratio from 85% to 97%.</p></li><li><p><strong>Storage:</strong> We migrated from AWS S3 to <strong>Cloudflare R2</strong>, eliminating massive egress fees and optimizing asset delivery.

For years, we outsourced this to external firms — the typical setup where you hand over receipts and hope for the best. But as we grew, flying blind between quarterly reports became untenable.</p><p>Now we run everything in-house with full visibility into our finances at any moment. No more waiting for external accountants to reconcile things. Same philosophy as the infrastructure migration: <strong>control beats convenience</strong> when you're building for the long term.</p><h2> <mark>Team:</mark> Still small by design <a data-anchor="team-still-small-by-design" id="team-still-small-by-design"></a><a data-permalink="" href="#team-still-small-by-design"></a></h2><p>This year marked our <strong>10th anniversary</strong> — a decade of surviving frontend trends, CMS wars, and the occasional existential crisis about whether "headless" is still a cool term. To celebrate, we flew our entire team to the Tuscan countryside to eat, drink, and ride quad bikes. You can read the full story of our trip (and our "25% Matteo concentration rate") here: <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.datocms.com/blog/dato-turns-ten"><strong>Dato Turns 10</strong></a>.</p><figure data-datocms-content-link-boundary=""> <prose-island> <embla-carousel>  </embla-carousel>  </prose-island> </figure><p>Despite our growth in revenue and traffic, we remain a team of just <strong>13 people</strong>. This isn't an accident — it's a deliberate choice.</p><p>As we wrote in <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.datocms.com/blog/how-can-you-be-eight-people"><strong>"How can you be eight people?"</strong></a> (well, now thirteen), building a massive organization is optional. We choose to ignore the pressure to maximize headcount or chase VC funding. Instead, we focus on what actually matters: a solid product, a healthy work-life balance, and staying profitable on our own terms. We don't mind "leaving a little water in the cloth" if it means we get to keep building the software we love, the way we want to build it.</p><h2> What's next? <a data-anchor="what-s-next" id="what-s-next"></a><a data-permalink="" href="#what-s-next"></a></h2><p>No idea.

We'll keep shipping what matters, keep ignoring the hype cycles, and keep cashing checks instead of burning through runway.</p><p>That said... <strong>we </strong><em><strong>may</strong></em><strong> have a few things cooking</strong> that we're genuinely excited about. But we're not going to jinx it by overpromising — you'll see them when they ship.</p><p>Well, see you in 2026. We'll still be here. Probably still 13 people. Definitely still not taking ourselves too seriously. 🧡</p>  </div></div>]]></description>

In iOS 26.3, EU wearable device makers can now test proximity pairing and improved notifications.</p>
<p>Here are the new capabilities that Apple is adding:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Proximity pairing</strong> - Devices like earbuds will be able to pair with an iOS device in an AirPods-like way by bringing the accessory close to an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> to initiate a simple, one-tap pairing process. Pairing third-party devices will no longer require multiple steps.</li>
<li><strong>Notifications</strong> - Third-party accessories like smart watches will be able to receive notifications from the ‌iPhone‌. Users will be able to view and react to incoming notifications, which is functionality normally limited to the Apple Watch. Notifications can only be forwarded to one connected device at a time, and turning on notifications for a third-party device disables notifications to an Apple Watch.</li>
</ul>
<p>The European Commission says that developers can test third-party TVs, smart watches, and headphones with the new features in iOS 26.3, with the functionality to be "fully available in Europe" in 2026.</p>
<p>iOS 26.3 offers "another step towards a more inter-connected digital ecosystem to the benefit of all EU citizens," according to the European Commission. iOS 26.3 is expected to launch at the end of January.</p>
<p>The changes to proximity pairing and notifications are only available for device makers and ‌iPhone‌ and ‌iPad‌ users in the European Union.</p>

<p>Archivists have saved and uploaded copies of the 60 Minutes episode new CBS editor-in-chief Bari Weiss ordered be shelved as a torrent and multiple file sharing sites after an international distributor aired the episode.&nbsp;</p><p>The moves show how difficult it may be for CBS to stop the episode, which focused on the experience of Venezuelans deported to El Salvadorian mega prison CECOT, from spreading across the internet. Bari Weiss stopped the episode from being released Sunday even after the episode was reviewed and checked multiple times by the news outlet, according <a href="https://x.com/grynbaum/status/2002943084322287815?ref=404media.co"><u>to an email</u></a> CBS correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi sent to her colleagues.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“You may recall earlier this year when the Trump administration deported hundreds of Venezuelan men to El Salvador, a country most had no connection to,” the show starts, according to a copy viewed by 404 Media.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Yesterday, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/business/793525/bari-weiss-cbs-news-glass-cliff">Bari Weiss, the new editor-in-chief of CBS News</a>, censored a segment of its newsmagazine <em>60 Minutes</em> about men who had been deported to an El Salvador prison. Today, it’s popping up online.</p><p><em>60 Minutes</em> had already begun promoting the now-censored segment online. Because it was pulled so late, it seems that CBS missed at least one platform for distribution: Canada’s Global TV. Some people used a VPN to watch it; at least one person recorded it, distributing it through an iCloud account.</p><p>The segment, which has been reviewed by <em>The Verge</em>, is a little shy of 14 minutes long. It features video of men, chained and bent double, being “paraded in front of cameras, pushed onto buses, and delivered to CECOT,” according to the segment’s narration. One former detainee, who CBS met in Colombia, said he was told he was “the living dead” at CECOT. After trying to seek asylum in the US, he says he was detained by customs and held for 6 months before being deported. He described horrific conditions at the prison, saying he was beaten until he bled and that he was thrown into a wall so hard he broke one of his teeth. He also described sexual assault by the guards. Another interviewed former detainee described what can only be called torture: being forced to kneel for 24 hours, and being put in a dark room, where they were beaten if they moved from the stress position.</p><div><p>“In my view, pulling it now, after every rigorous internal check has been met, is not an editorial decision, it is a political one.”</p></div><p>The men were among those who had been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/09/world/americas/el-salvador-trump-deportees-lawsuit.html">deported to El Salvador</a>, a country they are not from. The Trump administration has sent at least 288 people, mostly Venezuelans and Salvadorans, to CECOT after the president of El Salvador, Nayib Bukele, offered to house prisoners for a fee. Many of the people who were deported <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/09/world/americas/el-salvador-trump-deportees-lawsuit.html">were awaiting asylum cases</a>, according to <em>The New York Times. </em>It is perhaps the most horrific and breathtaking abuse of human rights from the Trump administration, and a vital area for continued reporting.</p><p>The Trump administration has more deals like the one with CECOT in the pipeline, worth “millions of dollars,” according to the segment. The US may begin deporting people to places they have no relationship with, such as South Sudan and Uganda, which also have “well-documented histories of torturing prisoners.”</p><p>The story, in addition to breaking news about the deals with other countries, appears to be thoroughly reported, and both the US Department of Homeland Security and El Salvador were given opportunities to comment.</p><p>“Our story was screened five times and cleared by both CBS attorneys and Standards and Practices,” wrote Sharyn Alfonsi, the reporter whose segment it was, in an email to colleagues yesterday, according to <em>The New York Times</em>. “It is factually correct. In my view, pulling it now, after every rigorous internal check has been met, is not an editorial decision, it is a political one.”</p><div><p>Because the order to kill the story came so late, CBS didn’t successfully replace the original program everywhere that had been set to deliver it</p></div><div><p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/12/21/cbs-news-bari-weiss-intervention/">The story had gotten through all the usual approvals</a>, including Weiss, who suddenly changed her mind. She demanded additional reporting, “including an on-camera interview with a member of the Trump administration,” according to <em>The Washington Post</em>. The story was killed on Saturday night, and the promotional material was removed on Sunday. Weiss sent an edit note saying, among other things, that <a href="https://x.com/thesimonetti/status/2003142908854313225/photo/3">the segment did not adequately explain the administration’s rationale for sending people to El Salvador</a>.</p></div><p>The notes do not seem unreasonable — except in their timing, which is belated and bizarre, practically calculated to cause an uproar. And, it seems, because the order to kill the story came so late, not every distributor replaced the program.</p><p>Weiss was placed in charge of CBS News by David Ellison as part of a fairly obvious attempt to placate the Trump administration and allow his company, Skydance, to acquire CBS parent company, Paramount. President Donald Trump has repeatedly whined about CBS — and <em>60 Minutes’</em> work in particular. Just before the takeover by Skydance, Paramount paid $16 million to settle a lawsuit Trump filed over the editing applied to an interview with Kamala Harris.</p><p>Ellison’s Skydance is now attempting to buy Warner Bros. in a hostile bid.</p><p>Weiss claimed on an editorial call on Monday that she “held that story because it wasn’t ready,” according to <em>The Washington Post</em>. The team had given the White House a chance to comment, and the Trump administration declined, according to the <em>Post.</em> “If the standard for airing a story becomes ‘the government must agree to be interviewed,’ then the government effectively gains control over the 60 Minutes broadcast. We go from an investigative powerhouse to a stenographer for the state,” Alfonsi wrote in her email.</p><p>Anyway, best of luck to Weiss in playing DMCA whack-a-mole with the video of the story. The segment lives as online samizdat now. Thanks to Weiss’ censorship, it may very well wind up being the most-talked-about CBS News story this year.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6ODA0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Elizabeth Lopatto</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div>]]></description>
