<ul>
<li>YouTube’s crackdown on ad blockers is causing users to uninstall the software in record numbers.</li>
<li>However, an even higher number of users are instead turning to better ad blockers that won’t trigger YouTube’s warning.</li>
<li>Some users are even going as far as to switch to a new browser.</li>
</ul>
</div><p>YouTube recently expanded its ad-blocking efforts, transitioning from just a small experiment to a global launch. The move appears to have had some success, as users are uninstalling the software in record numbers. But you can also argue it has had the opposite effect, as even higher numbers of users are turning to <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/best-ad-blocker-apps-android-954917/">better ad blockers</a>.</p><p>Hundreds of thousands of users have uninstalled ad blockers in October, seemingly in connection with YouTube’s broadened crackdown, according to a report from <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/youtubes-ad-blocker-crackdown-spurs-record-uninstalls/" target="_blank"><em>Wired</em></a>. At the same time, data shows that record-breaking numbers of people are also installing alternatives that won’t be caught in YouTube’s net.</p><p>Krzysztof Modras of Ghostery — one of the more popular ad blockers in Chrome’s extension store — says they have seen three to five times the amount of installs and uninstalls over the last month. Over 90% of those users who uninstalled the extension cited the software failing on YouTube as the reason for their decision. However, the company saw a 30% uptick in installations on Microsoft Edge, with users attempting to find a suitable alternative.</p><p>Another blocker, AdGuard, told the outlet they normally see about 6,000 uninstallations per day on Chrome, but that shot up to 11,000 per day between October 9 and the end of the month, peaking at 52,000 on October 18. However, the paid version of the extension appears to be immune to YouTube’s ban. It’s reported that the company says when people realized this, user counts increased, reaching up to 60,000 installations on October 18 and October 27.</p><p>Right now, it appears YouTube’s crackdown on ad blockers has people scrambling to find a better alternative. Some people are even turning to solutions like Newpipe, a YouTube-like website that’s capable of running videos from the platform without ads.</p><p>Experts from the industry, like Modras, are warning that YouTube’s efforts to stop ad blockers could result in more complex blocking tactics. These more complex tactics could lead to the creation of unintentional security holes.</p><p>If you’re looking alternatives, extensions like uBlock Origin still work when used on Firefox. Adblock Plus has also offered <a href="https://blog.adblockplus.org/blog/whats-happening-with-youtube-ads" target="_blank">some suggestions</a> on how to get past the anti-ad block wall. There’s also the option of biting the bullet and paying for <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/youtube-premium-1119004/">YouTube Premium</a>.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>Nuclear is back. After decades of decline in the West’s nuclear energy industry, public and private support of nuclear energy is reversing course. As the specter of climate change grows and intensifies, increased nuclear power production has emerged as a promising pathway to solving the world’s&nbsp;<a href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cdp-2023-0074/#:~:text=What%20is%20the%20energy%20trilemma,and%20reliability%20of%20energy%20supplies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">energy trilemma</a>: an energy supply that is secure, affordable, and sustainable.&nbsp;</p><p>While nuclear has received a lot of bad press in the past thanks to high profile nuclear disasters like Fukushima, Chernobyl, and Three Mile Island, its numerous benefits have been receiving more and more attention in recent years. In fact, public support for nuclear energy in the United States is at a&nbsp;<a href="https://oilprice.com/Alternative-Energy/Nuclear-Power/Support-For-Nuclear-Energy-In-The-US-Is-At-A-10-Year-High.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10-year high</a>&nbsp;according to a Gallup poll released earlier this year.&nbsp;<!-- /192633929/OilPrice-300x250-ATF-Mobile -->

<!-- END: /192633929/OilPrice-300x250-ATF-Mobile -->
</p><p>Nuclear advocates argue that nuclear energy has a number of unique benefits that we can no longer afford to overlook in the context of climate change. It is a completely carbon-free form of energy production, and – crucially – it’s a baseload power source. This means that, unlike solar and wind energy, its production isn’t variable, waxing and waning according to weather patterns and the Earth’s rotation. While wind and solar have some significant advantages over nuclear (no toxic waste, for one thing), their scalability is currently limited by their variability and the relatively undeveloped long-term energy storage sector.&nbsp;</p><p>Nuclear is also a proven technology with plenty of existing infrastructure. While the United States fleet of nuclear power plants is aging after decades of disinterest and neglect, it’s still formidable – nuclear power still provides&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=427&amp;t=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nearly 20%</a>&nbsp;of the nation’s energy. And while the nuclear sector had stalled out in the West over the last few decades, nuclear plant technology has marched forward, solving some of the major challenges toward re-embracing nuclear as a central power source. While traditional nuclear reactors are extremely costly to build, recent breakthroughs in&nbsp;<a href="https://oilprice.com/Alternative-Energy/Nuclear-Power/Small-Nuclear-Reactors-The-Answer-To-Big-Techs-Energy-Crisis.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">small modular reactors</a>&nbsp;– which can be mass produced in a dedicated facility and assembled onsite – are already changing this.&nbsp;</p><p>The changing tides for nuclear energy can be quantified through market patterns for the uranium that fuels the reactors. Yellowcake uranium prices have skyrocketed, reaching their highest level in over a decade, going by more than 10% month-over-month. “Uranium demand has been lifted by governments from Washington to Seoul and Paris seeking energy independence by extending the lifetime of the existing fleet of nuclear reactors as they contemplate building new plants after gas prices skyrocketed due to Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine,” the Financial Times&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/de05a4a2-2458-4450-99c2-9dd0e079e9cd?fbclid=IwAR0ndrqQYOrITqILnAGdj9NUB8FPAVBieaRSu0ZnpDKCeDOBszuTZhDfhOE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a>&nbsp;last month.&nbsp;</p><p>“You have a focus on energy security colliding with a focus on clean energy,” Grant Isaac, chief financial officer at Cameco, the world’s second-largest uranium producer, told the Financial Times. “The days of buying $40 uranium are over — and probably also for $50 or $60. We’re going to need new supplies,” he added. Uranium mining has seriously dipped since the Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011, when demand plummeted. This is also a factor in pushing up prices, and a major incentive for new mining ventures looking to get in on the current demand surge. While uranium prices still haven’t rebounded to pre-Fukushima levels, they’re well on their way, and some speculators think that they could skyrocket to around $200 per pound by just 2025.<!-- /192633929/OilPrice-300x250-BTF-Mobile -->

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="articleContent" id="article-content"><p>A California jury has awarded $332 million to a man who sued chemical giant Monsanto Co. contending that his cancer was related to decades of using its Roundup weedkiller.</p><div>



<p>A San Diego Superior Court jury awarded damages Tuesday in a lawsuit filed by Mike Dennis, 57, of Carlsbad. He was diagnosed in 2020 with a rare form of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma.</p>



<p>His lawsuit contended that his illness was related to Roundup’s active ingredient, glyphosate.</p>



<p>Dennis had treatment and has been in remission for nearly three years but there is no cure, Adam Peavy, one of his attorneys, told&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/san-diego-county-jury-reaches-332m-verdict-in-trial-claiming-roundup-caused-carlsbad-mans-cancer/3343895/" target="_self" rel="">KNSD-TV.</a></p>



<p>“His doctors have told him it’s going to come back and we’re just waiting to see if that happens,” Peavy said.</p>



<p>The jury found that Monsanto, which is now a division of <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/03/10/shareholders-are-forcing-bayers-ceo-out-what-do-they-expect-from-his-replacement/" target="_self" rel="">pharmaceutical and biotechnology giant Bayer</a>, failed to provide warnings of Roundup’s risks. But jurors also ruled partially in Bayer’s favor by finding the product design wasn’t defective and the company wasn’t negligent.</p>



<p>Dennis was awarded $7 million in compensatory damages and $325 million in punitive damages.</p>



<p>In a statement to KNSD-TV, <a href="https://fortune.com/company/bayer/" target="_blank" rel="">Bayer</a> said it believes “we have strong arguments on appeal to get this unfounded verdict overturned and the unconstitutionally excessive damage award eliminated or reduced.”</p>



<p>“There were significant and reversible legal and evidentiary errors made during this trial,” Bayer added.</p>



<p>Bayer bought Monsanto for $63 billion in 2018 and has been trying to deal with thousands of claims and lawsuits related to Roundup. In 2020, Bayer&nbsp;<a href="https://apnews.com/article/a12603a80c8238d1f7af3705cfec610a" target="_self" rel="">announced</a>&nbsp;it would pay up to $10.9 billion to settle some 125,000 filed and unfiled claims.</p></div><p><em>Subscribe to the CFO Daily newsletter to keep up with the trends, issues, and executives shaping corporate finance. <a href="https://www.fortune.com/newsletters/cfodaily?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=cfo_daily" target="_self" rel="">Sign up</a> for free.</em></p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>03 November 2023</p>

<p>You made me create a wooden Game Boy shell. Yes, you made me do it. After I got myself a CNC machine a while back I just made a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/ePvpYVNEvzk" target="_blank">wooden Game Boy cartridge</a> to get to know the machine, but social media wanted more. So, I made a Game Boy out of walnut wood.</p>

<p>You can see the process in the video without much explanation.

<h2 id="a-wooden-game-boy">A wooden Game Boy</h2>

<p>This project mostly began as a user request. When I got myself a CNC router a few months ago, one of the little exercises I did was a wooden Game Boy cartridge (see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/ePvpYVNEvzk" target="_blank">Youtube short clip</a> or <a href="https://github.com/Staacks/wooden-game-boy-cartridge" target="_blank">project files on GitHub</a>). It was a mix of “let’s see if I can do that” and “sure the retro gamers on social media will love this”, but I did not expect how much they would love it and of course they asked for more. So, I did some testing, spent some time and several weeks later I find myself in the possession of a Game Boy with a beautiful walnut wood shell.</p>

<p>I mean, look at that thing. Isn’t it gorgeous? So, if you want to learn how exactly it was built, read on. If you just want to see some CNC timelapses and detail shots of the wooden Game Boy, you should probably watch the <a href="https://youtu.be/rECMivhOat4" target="_blank">Youtube video</a> instead.</p>

<h2 id="important-notes">Important notes</h2>

<p>Before we go into details, there are some general things you should know to properly judge the results. At least if you plan to reproduce the Game Boy, you should read these carefully.</p>

<ul>
  <li>I am a total noob. Yeah, I know that Game Boy does not look like the work of a noob and I would like to believe that I have proven that I can use a CNC router, but the noobness does not necessarily refer to the complexity of the project or my ability to wield some 3d software. This is more about best practices and hardware suggestions. I document what I did and which tools I used, but you should be aware that what I did mostly uses the first method I learned and the tools are the first tools of this kind that I own. They worked to create that Game Boy, but I lack the experience to tell if they are the best or even good methods/tools for this job.</li>
  <li>Related to this, I barely have any experience with wood. I have applied what I learned from some videos, but I have no idea how long that Game Boy will last. Wood tends to grow, shrink and bend over time, especially if exposed to changing humidity. This Game Boy could become something that I pass along to my grand children or it could crack open tomorrow. I literally have no experience to make any assumptions about this.</li>
  <li>The project is far from perfect and many design choices were made as it went along. At the end I knew some things better than at the beginning and some later toolpaths are designed to fix problems of the earlier one. The Game Boy you see here is my successful first attempt, but this also means that the design files have not been polished or tested a second time.</li>
  <li>I designed this Game Boy around aftermarket parts and especially for using an IPS mod. It should also fit original displays, but I have not tried that.</li>
  <li>In the end I closed the case with wood glue, because the original screws did not hold it together properly. So, there currently is no way to open it for maintenance. Read the notes of the drilling toolpaths for more info and thoughts on the problem.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="project-files-and-software">Project files and software</h2>

<p>Let’s start with the bad news for most of those who already have a CNC machine and just want to reproduce my work: I use the Blender CAM plugin. Yes, there is a CNC CAM plugin for Blender and it is free. Yes, it is quite versatile and powerful. Yes, using it is a pain in the ass even if you are used to Blender.</p>

<p>Still, I love it and the CAM alternatives that seem to allow me to do similar things are very expensive<sup id="fnref:linux" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:linux" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. So, I ended up using Blender CAM, which unfortunately means that many CNC users out there will cry before having to copy my models to their CAM to painstakingly recreate the toolpaths there.</p>

<p>Therefore, the project files are <em>blend</em> files <a href="https://github.com/Staacks/wooden-game-boy" target="_blank">on GitHub</a> and I release everything under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 license. Do what ever you like with it, just make sure to mention me as the source. …and maybe keep in mind that Nintendo might want to have a word about trademarks if you try to sell these with their logo on it.</p>

<p>In addition to the <em>blend</em> files I have also uploaded the gcode files that I actually used. They are for <a href="https://github.com/grbl/grbl" target="_blank">grbl-based machines</a>, but even if your CNC uses a grbl controller it is a bad idea to just feed them to your machine. You will have to adapt it to the equipment that you actually use and I only added them as reference to review and compare.</p>

<p>Speaking of equipment-specific things: The feeds and cutting depths set in the <em>blend</em> files are for the weak spindle on my machine. If your spindle is stronger, you can quite certainly go a lot faster. But also keep in mind that the <strong>speeds in the <em>blend</em> files do not have any meaning</strong>. My spindle is not digitally controlled and since it has little torque at lower speeds I pretty much used it at its maximum of 10,000 rpm. You will have to adapt this to your machine and your bits.</p>

<h2 id="the-hardware-i-used">The hardware I used</h2>

<p>Remember that I only got my CNC machine a few months ago, so do not expect comparative insights here. I will document what I use and try to explain a few things to people who have never used a CNC before. If you have a CNC and are just interested in the toolpaths, you can probably skip to the table with bits I used.</p>

<h3 id="the-cnc-machine">The CNC machine</h3>

<p>If you have never looked at CNC machines before, this probably looks like a very fancy and professional setup. If you know about CNC machines, you probably recognize immediately that it isn’t. My machine is a <a href="https://www.amazon.de/Genmitsu-PROVerXL-4030-3-Achsen-Graviermaschine-Kugelumlaufspindel/dp/B0C57YC46Q/ref=sr_1_2?crid=1U17F5MJP5IVT&amp;keywords=proverxl+4030+v2&amp;qid=1698789743&amp;sprefix=proverxl%252Caps%252C136&amp;sr=8-2&amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=oughtabe-21&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;linkId=ab08ff80c388456f7dd1a0eac9b976af&amp;camp=1638&amp;creative=6742" target="_blank">Genmitsu PROVerXL 4030 V2</a>, which is the toughest Genmitsu CNC router, but in the world of hobbyist CNC machines ranks somewhere in the middle. It is much more rigid than the small 3D printer like machines (that Genmitsu machines are often associated with), but much smaller and weaker than machines by more prestigious brands.</p>

<p>As a beginner I think that it is extremely capable for my needs, but its weak spot is its stock 400W spindle. Compared to stronger machines you will find that my toolpaths take much longer as I am doing significantly shallower cuts. Also the spindle is pretty much limited to its top speed of 10,000rpm as it seems to lack torque at lower settings. For the finer tools I would have wished for a higher speed and for some situations a reduced speed might have been beneficial as well. Luckily, this can be upgraded and I probably will do so in the future.</p>

<p>In the end, I mostly chose the 4030 V2 because of its rather small footprint. While others might consider this to be a disadvantage, it was the largest machine that I could fit into an enclosure onto my workbench. Since I do not have a proper wood workshop, the machine has to share a room with other hobbies in my basement, which means that I needed to address noise and dust, because CNC machines can deliver plenty of both.</p>

<p>I went for the <a href="https://openbuildspartstore.com/modular-enclosure-system/" target="_blank">OpenBuilds Enclosure Kit 510</a>, added acoustic foam and paired it with the <a href="https://www.amazon.de/Genmitsu-Staubschutzschuh-Durchmesser-Spindelmotoren-Au%25C3%259Fendurchmesser/dp/B09QM4DLKK/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_w=Hqi7Z&amp;content-id=amzn1.sym.414f57ed-562f-47a3-9f9d-2fc23abd569f%253Aamzn1.symc.adba8a53-36db-43df-a081-77d28e1b71e6&amp;pf_rd_p=414f57ed-562f-47a3-9f9d-2fc23abd569f&amp;pf_rd_r=ZQ52E38MHKKN5W61JYGM&amp;pd_rd_wg=lx81o&amp;pd_rd_r=4dbd95d4-7a8d-4270-89a8-6e8d66ac83d8&amp;ref_=pd_gw_ci_mcx_mr_hp_atf_m&amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=oughtabe-21&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;linkId=73b06a2d3b45b4382ef6faf701724823&amp;camp=1638&amp;creative=6742" target="_blank">Genmitsuo dust shoe</a> and a flexible hose. The vacuum hose then runs through a <a href="https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B00HXDYL70/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_image_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=oughtabe-21&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;linkId=53a58215ae523681316ed7c26fa3ed14&amp;camp=1638&amp;creative=6742" target="_blank">cyclonic separator</a> and ends in a <a href="https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B01JP7BOTE/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_image_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1" target="_blank">Makita vacuum</a>. Add a workbench, an LED lamp inside the enclosure and a screen at the side (you might recognize this one from my <a href="https://there.oughta.be/a/bullet-time-video-booth">bullet time rig</a>) and that’s my setup.</p>

<p>Just a few warnings if you are thinking about picking up CNC as a hobby: Do not underestimate the noise and the amount of dust such a machine produces. The enclosure and dust extraction in my case ate up a huge part of my budget for a good reason. If you are in a dirty workshop far from other people you can ignore the enclosure, but please still think about your hearing and your lungs. I highly recommend to use a dust extraction system anyway and if you are doing this in a room that you spend a lot of time in or that you use for other things in general, a simple shop vacuum will not be enough. Fine saw dust will escape regular vacuums and you should really look into ones with a filter for dust class M.</p>

<p>Oh, and one more warning: I do not have a problem to leave my 3D printer unattended as long as I can check in once in a while through a webcam. The typical 3D printer accidents turn the machine into a PLA spaghetti factory, but it is still ok if you stop it 15 minutes later. The more dangerous typical fail state of a 3D printer is a cable fire especially on cheap printers like mine, but if you place your printer in an environment of low flammability there is plenty of time to recognize the problem before severe consequences.</p>

<p>This is different for a CNC machine! If things go south with a CNC machine, they go south fast! The typical CNC accident means driving a sharp piece of metal rotating at 10,000 rpm into something that was not supposed to receive that piece of metal. You can break a lot of stuff within seconds and that is the harmless case. Imagine running that 10,000 rpm metal stick into a dry piece of wood and leaving it there because of a failure or maybe because that wood got loose and now follows your machine. Remember those adventure movies where they make fire with a rotating stick? Do this with a 400W motor covered by saw dust and maybe with a dust extraction system sucking everything into the big container with even more sawdust.</p>

<p>The point is that you should not leave a running CNC machine, have a fire extinguisher nearby and make sure to have an easily accessible emergency stop that actually cuts power to your machine (in case of an enclose, put something <a href="https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B09FK8KHC9/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_image_o09_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=oughtabe-21&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;linkId=6b2fbd57c48ea67cb2eacb8bbf65fee2&amp;camp=1638&amp;creative=6742" target="_blank">like this</a> on the outside). Here is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tpxgZUYGSI&amp;ab_channel=WinstonMoy" target="_blank">a video to encourage you to take this serious</a>.</p>

<h3 id="the-bits">The bits</h3>

<p>Like in the previous section, I will be talking to people new to CNC routers here. Someone who already knows this stuff will probably just have a glimpse at the table below anyway.</p>

<p>While CNC machining often looks like you are just pushing a common drill bit to some wood, this is not what is happening at all (unless maybe you are actually drilling holes with your CNC). What looks like a drill bit usually is a milling bit (a so-called end mill). It is not designed to plunge vertically into the material (although in many cases it has to be able to do this, too), but to carve away material horizontally.</p>

<p>One interesting aspect of this is that the spiral of the bit might go in different directions. Some bits have a right-handed spiral like a drilling bit, but others can be left-handed or not even have a spiral form at all. The reason is that the actual milling is done at the side and just requires sharp edges while the spiral mostly helps to move the material away from the cutting edge. Right-handed drills are common as you want to push material upwards out of the drilling hole and for the same reason you will find many end mills with that shape. They pull material upwards and away from your work piece, therefore they are called “upcut” bits. The downside of this is that the upwards motion can fray the edges of your work piece, which is why I also often use the counterpart with a left-handed spiral, the “downcut” bit. There are also some other forms and compromises, but I only have those two variants and so for each task I have to pick a suitable diameter for my end mill (obviously you need small ones for details and large one to remove much material fast) and decide between upcut and downcut as a trade-off between a nice finish and efficient material removal especially in tight spots.</p>

Each one is shown from the side with indications of diameter, shape and cutting direction." srcset="    https://there.oughta.be/assets/resized/images/2023-11-03/640/bits.jpg 640w,    https://there.oughta.be/assets/resized/images/2023-11-03/768/bits.jpg 768w,    https://there.oughta.be/assets/resized/images/2023-11-03/1024/bits.jpg 1024w,    https://there.oughta.be/assets/resized/images/2023-11-03/1280/bits.jpg 1280w, https://there.oughta.be/assets/images/2023-11-03/bits.jpg 3840w" sizes="(max-width: 60rem) 100vw, 60rem">

<figcaption>The nine bits I used in this project, roughly grouped by shape and size.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Another aspect is the shape of the tip of the bit. The most common one is the flat end mill, which is best suited to create a flat surface. However, if you want to create a curved 3D shape, this is not a good choice as it tends to create little steps that look similar to the layers of 3D printers. A ballnose bit with a circular tip can help as it can create a slope between one line to the next one.</p>

<p>A very important shape is the V-shape. On one hand, this is used to directly create angled edges (chamfers) in a single pass, but also they can be used to carve text or other designs. Imagine to just try and cut a small square. If you use a flat end mill with a 3mm diameter, you can quickly remove the material from the square, but the corners will always be rounded with a radius of 1.5mm. So, instead you use a smaller end mill, let’s say 1mm. Now it takes ages to remove the material<sup id="fnref:longsmallbit" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:longsmallbit" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> and still have round corners, now with a radius of 0.5mm (which might be ok for many use cases). That’s where the V-bit shines: If you do not care about how deep you cut, but just want to have a 2D shape at the surface, a V-shaped bit can simply use different depths to have different diameters at the surface. Need a tiny bit for a sharp corner? Only use the very tip of the bit. Need a large diameter to clear most of that example square? Go deep for a large radius. The result is a typical angled V-carving look that many (including me) find quite pleasing. Just search for V-carving on Youtube to find a bunch of very satisfying videos.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, that still is not all that needs to be considered when picking the right tool for each detail. You also need to consider the cutting length and the overall clearance of your bits. The cutting length is how deep the bit can go so that its sharp bits are still cutting away material instead of its dull bits just rubbing the wood and heating it up. That’s not much of an issue for me as my weak spindle usually limits the depth of my cuts anyway. The clearance is a much bigger issue because overlooking it usually causes some kind of damage. Whenever you cut into the material (or when you use clamps to hold your stock<sup id="fnref:bluetape" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:bluetape" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>) you need to have enough space for your machine and the rest of the bit. The machine itself mostly becomes a problem for deep pockets, but those small diameter end mills often still have a larger shaft. So, even if you observe the cutting length, you cannot cut at the side of a straight wall if you would run the shaft of your bit into it.</p>

<p>That should be enough of an overview. I am mostly writing down what I learned from others (mostly Youtube) over a few months, so I would recommend that, too, if you want to go deeper.</p>

<p>Now, finally, here is the list of bits I used in this project and the short name I use for them henceforth<sup id="fnref:henceforth" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:henceforth" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Please keep in mind that I only got my first CNC router a few months ago, so these are mostly the first bits I ever used. I have no comparison to tell if they are good or bad, so take this as pure documentation and not as an endorsement.</p>

<h2 id="the-outside-of-the-bottom-shell-a">The outside of the bottom shell (A)</h2>

<p>Ok, it’s time to get serious. In the following I will go through all the toolpaths one by one and try to remember details that you should know about. For each one I will mention the bit I used, how long it took and the name of the gcode file I used (if available). As mentioned above it is unlikely that you can use the gcode file directly, but you should be able to view it in order to understand what the toolpath does.</p>

<p>The first step is to create the outside of the bottom half of the shell. For this you need a piece of wood with at least 160mm by 99.6mm and it should have a thickness of at least 23mm. Having a few more millimeters is highly recommended to allow for a few surfacing steps without becoming too thin.</p>

<p>And surfacing is exactly what we start with. The current surface will be the one visible on the back of the Game Boy shell. So, it should look nice and needs to be surfaced down to a clean even plane. Keep in mind that the remaining thickness needs to be at least 23mm even after possibly surfacing the other side too. The exact thickness does not matter yet, so just aim for a nice finish on this side.</p>

<p>This is my method of aligning the workpiece after flipping it. I drill small holes through to the backside that I can use to align it after turning it around. If you have a better way of doing this like a flip jig, a tool to measure distances along all three axes or even an additional axis, you can skip this toolpath.</p>

<p>I labeled this as a single path, but please notice that I have split it into two gcode files. The reason is that the working distance of my smallest bit is too short to go all the way through 23mm without hitting the wood with its wider 3mm shaft. So, there is a first step of drilling space for that shaft before creating the smaller and more precise holes on the backside.</p>

<p>If you use my solution, take note that zero is set to the corner of the Game Boy, so the hole in that corner will be drilled 5mm along negative x and y. So, when picking the start point to fit the 160mm by 99.6mm of the reference frame, keep in mind to offset zero by 5mm in both directions. This will be the zero for all subsequent steps, too.</p>

<p>Oh, and obviously, this step will drill through the entire workpiece and into your spoilboard.</p>

<p>Next I do a profile cut that does not go all the way through. It will eventually meet with a profile cut from the other side (if aligned properly). At this point it also gives room for a few upcoming toolpaths that enter and leave the outer rim of the Game Boy shell.</p>

<p>The curved sides on the back are created with a ballnose bit.

<p>This step carves the pockets for the cartridge slot and the battery compartment. Note, that it removes more material in the battery compartment than on the actual original Game Boy shell to make space for the upcoming toolpath using a 1.5mm downcut bit. My 1.5mm bit only has about 8mm of clearance before sloping into a 3mm shaft, so in order to create the finer details inside the battery compartment some room needs to be made. If you have a bit without such a limitation, you might want to optimize this towards the original.</p>

<p>As mentioned before, this adds some details in the battery compartment. Important ones: These are the slits that will hold the battery contacts. My design is made for some after market contacts (see assembly section), but it has too much room and I needed to put something behind the contacts to hold them in place. If you know the exact contacts you want to use, this is something that could be optimized.</p>

<p>Oh, and this path also creates the decorative lines on the back of the Game Boy.</p>

<p>The last step on this side drills some holes for the screws. These are not the holes the screws tap into, but the holes that the screws go through first. I have not tested the diameter much because I ended up gluing the shell, but they seemed ok.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="the-inside-of-the-bottom-shell-b">The inside of the bottom shell (B)</h2>

<p>Now it is time to flip the workpiece to do the inside of the bottom half. To do so, align it with your favorite method.</p>

<p>If you use my reference drills, align your workpiece such that you can jog 160mm along x and 99.6mm along y and always end up on one of the small 1mm holes as precisely as possible. Remember that you cannot fix the rotation of your workpiece if you use the tape and glue method (like I do), in which case I would recommend using a carpenter’s square to get the orientation right while gluing it and then use the holes to verify and to set zero.</p>

<p>Speaking of zero on my reference frame: Remember that the hole is at -5mm and -5mm, so align your bit above the correct hole and then move it by 5mm along x and y <strong>before</strong> setting zero. Keep that zero for the rest of the steps for the bottom half.</p>

<p>Once again, it is time for surfacing. However, this time you are aiming for a final thickness of exactly 23mm. Of course, if you need to remove a lot of material, you can use a different method first, but at the end of this step you should have a perfectly flat workpiece with a thickness of 23mm. I designed the two sides to allow for a little uncertainty here, but I would say that you should hit 23mm to within about half a millimeter.</p>

<p>This is the big workhorse step for this side. This removes most material to make room for the PCBs and it creates most of the relevant geometry inside. However, my gcode had a few problems here that you might want to improve on:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I manually created layers for the pocketing that are far from optimal. By now I know better methods to do this, but at that time this was the best I could do in Blender CAM. The current toolpaths are inefficient and imprecise in a few places. You might want to recreate them with your preferred software (and especially if you have a beefier machine that can handle deeper cuts).</li>
  <li>A big mistake here is that one or two of the lower toolpaths accidentally cut away the lip and part of the rim of the shell near the power switch as well as the screw post near that switch. I compensated for that with a larger lip on the top half of the shell, but that is far from perfect. The reason for this error seems to be a boolean operator that did not work properly and failed to subtract that part of the rim from the pocketing area. Whatever the reason, you should carefully look at what would happen to the rim at the top of your Game Boy.</li>
  <li>Some parts were a bit imprecise. The screw posts for the metal shield of the Game Boy come to mind or the lower end of the link cable cutout. If you want to be precise, check out my photos and adjust things that are not perfect.</li>
</ul>

<p>First of all note that as far as I remember, the only reason for using an upcut bit here is that my 1.5mm upcut is a few millimeters longer than my 1.5mm downcut. If this is not a limitation for your tool, you should be fine with a downcut end mill, too, except maybe for some drilling for the screws.</p>

<p>This step adds some details to the power switch part, the battery contact cutouts for the main PCB and some small details like a little cutaway behind one of the screw posts to make space for the speaker cable. It also drills holes for the screws to tap in. In my experience the 1.5mm holes do not hold the thin original screws reliably. On the top half I will later drill 1mm holes, which unfortunately tended to break if a screw is tapped into a pole. So, some experimentation with alternative screws and drilling diameters might be in order here, especially if you plan to use a different kind of wood.</p>

<p>Now it is time for the iconic front of the Game Boy. Please read steps C02 to C03 carefully and think about them. These are the common sign-maker’s method of doing a V-carve, painting everything and then cutting away the excessive paint. I have little experience here and this is the part of my wooden Game Boy that I am absolutely not happy with. My method (or choice of paint or choice of tools or whatever) lead to quite some smearing of the paint and letters that look soft and unfocused.</p>

<p>If making the entire wooden Game Boy was less time intensive, I would probably have another try with white epoxy instead of paint. I also notice that many hobby CNCists<sup id="fnref:aword" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:aword" rel="footnote">6</a></sup> use a belt or disc sander for this instead of a surfacing bit, so maybe that’s part of the problem. If you recognize why this did not work out so nicely in my case, please let me know. Anyhow, below is what I did to get the Nintendo logo and labels onto my Game Boy and you might want to think about a different method.</p>

<p>You will also notice that I did not list a surfacing step. That’s because my method involves V-carving below zero and a later surfacing step anyway. Depending on what you want to do, you might want to surface first.</p>

<p>Again, the reference for flipping. Again, skip if you prefer a different method. And again, if you use mine, remember to offset zero by 5mm along x and y.</p>

<p>But there is one <strong>important difference</strong>: If you use my method of painting you will have to remove the workpiece, paint it, replace it and realign it on the same side. That might not work with a flip jig if it cannot be fixed to your machine’s bed.</p>

<p>Now, this engraves the Nintendo logo and button labels with a V-shaped bit. I actually ran that toolpath twice: Once starting from the surface (resulting in perfect letters at the surface) and then again starting 2mm below the surface. This is because I will later remove 2mm to return to the perfect letters and remove excessive paint. I did this in two steps because I was not sure if plunging a total of 4mm directly would be too much (now I think it wouldn’t). Also, 2mm might be a bit much, but I had made the observation in earlier tests that white paint enters the wood grain even with a clear coat primer, so I wanted to be safe.</p>

<p>A step that is not a toolpath. Paint your workpiece such that the logo and labels are properly colored. I used spray paint for this and first applied several layers of clear coat as a primer. After it had dried completely, I added several layers of white spray paint. The point of the primer is mostly to prevent white paint from entering the wood grain and showing up several millimeters deeper where it should not be visible. Make sure to seal up every part that could get sprayed with white paint - not only the actual letters.</p>

<p>Any suggestions on improving this method are welcome.</p>

<p>And of course, I had to remove my workpiece for this step. If you apply paint with a brush, you might be able to do this in place.</p>

<p>Here I now removed the 2mm that I dove too deep during V-engraving. This removes all the paint outside the carved area, theoretically leaving me with perfect and precise letters. However, as mentioned above I am not entirely happy with the result and you might want to consider alternative methods.</p>

<p>Next I did a profile cut and again not all the way through. This gives some room for some of the upcoming toolpaths at the edge. Also note that I will chamfer the outline of the Game Boy front, so there is no need for a downcut bit here.</p>

<p>The pocketing of the buttons, the actual screen and the speaker grill is done with a finer bit. In some cases because of thin lines and in some cases to achieve sharper corners. In some cases because it seemed like the buttons should be part of this package.</p>

<p>Finally, my favorite step of most CNC projects. Chamfering. So satisfying.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there is a mistake in my toolpath. While just following the outline works perfectly for most parts of the Game Boy front, I underestimated the effect of the slope at the speaker corner. A 45° chamfer towards this slight incline resulted in a bit of overhand and a slightly weird look. I sanded<sup id="fnref:hate:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:hate" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> most of the problem away, but you might want to consider skipping chamfering in this corner.</p>

<p>The last step on the outside of the top half just adds the decorative fine lines to the front. This is quick and easy, but note that the only reason for using an upcut bit here is that I simply don’t own a 1mm downcut bit.</p>

<p>If you use wood from the same board as the bottom half of the shell, you probably have to remove a lot of material here. You are aiming for a final thickness of 14.5mm. And this one needs to be very precise. On the bottom half a too thick shell might make it harder to get the battery contacts through to the battery compartment, but on the top half this impacts the top position of your buttons, how deep the screen is below the window and whether your speaker grill goes through (spoiler: mine didn’t).</p>

<p>This is the massive pocketing job for the inside, covering most parts. Note that I took some liberty in optimizing the shape for a subtractive process. The original injection mold shape obviously tried to save material while we would like to save on carving away material. So in many parts I left a lot of wood in there, where the original Game Boy just has pockets of air. This should also make it more rigid.</p>

<p>Adding details that could not be done with a 3mm bit in the previous step. Most notably some details around the buttons and the inside part of the speaker grill. Like on the original, the speaker grill is designed such that the lines on the outside just touch the ones on the inside to create openings. Unfortunately, this just did not work out on my build, but the sound can still be heard very well, so I am not attempting to tinker with it. However, you might want to keep an eye on the problem and maybe move paths closer together.</p>

<p>Super short, super simple. The cutout for the headphone jack. I only used a ballnose because this is curved. If you want to save time, you could probably have just done it with a flat end mill in one of the previous steps.</p>

<p>This drills 1mm holes into the poles for the screws to tap in. As mentioned in step B03, the 1mm holes also did not work perfectly. In my opinion they are better than the 1.5mm holes I used on the bottom half, but the longer poles near the display were split by the screws in this case. If you come up with a better solution, I would like to know.</p>

<h2 id="battery-cover-e">Battery cover (E)</h2>

<p>Wait, we are not done yet. You still need a battery cover. However, since I did not see how the latch of the original Game Boy could be created with a CNC and survive more than one battery changes, I made a very simple design that uses magnets to hold the cover in place.</p>

<figure>

<p>So, this is a rather quick process and you only need a piece of wood with an even thickness of about 4mm to 5mm.

<p>This step cuts references for flipping and adds the decorative lines on the outside of the battery cover. That’s it. Nothing more to see here and it is time to flip the wood piece to the other side.</p>

<p>This of course could have been one gcode file, but I couldn’t be bothered for this little part at the end of all the work. In this step you will flatten the cover to the desired thickness while leaving a lip that prevents it from sliding out. Here you also create the pockets for the magnets and do the profile cut, which will go below your workpiece into your spoil board.</p>

<h2 id="assembly">Assembly</h2>

<p>That’s it, the hard part is done. You should sand<sup id="fnref:hate:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:hate" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> any problematic or rough parts and apply wood finish. I use <a href="https://www.amazon.de/dp/B08TWRJST5?psc=1&amp;ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=oughtabe-21&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;linkId=056f51304a598794d03e7c3cad6423f2&amp;camp=1638&amp;creative=6742" target="_blank">boiled Linseed oil</a>, but there are many options<sup id="fnref:linseed" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:linseed" rel="footnote">7</a></sup> out there and many people with more experience in selecting them.</p>

<p>After that, you should be able to simply disassemble a Game Boy and replace its shell with your new wooden one.</p>

<p>I actually only used the original mainboard of a broken Game Boy from ebay and aftermarket parts for everything else, so let me show you a few details.</p>

<figcaption>The original metal shield between cartridge slot and mainboard can simply be screwed into the wooden shell with the original screws.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>First of all, the metal shield between mainboard and cartridge slot can simply be screwed into the wooden shell with the original screws (ok, those are also original parts). You just might need to file away some edges to fit the bent parts around the screw posts.</p>

<figure>

<p>The same is true for the PCB and the attached boards. However, here I already had some problems of screws not holding well in the 1.5mm drills I did on the bottom half. The 1mm drills on the top half worked better, but posts tended to break there, so be careful here.</p>

<p>In the battery compartment you just have to insert the additional contacts. The outer contacts are already there from the PCB. Note, that in contrast to the photo above I had to put a thin piece of cardboard behind the contacts to press them against the batteries.</p>

<figcaption>The aftermarket plastic buttons fit perfectly.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The white aftermarket plastic buttons fit perfectly, but there are some tricky aspects to the silicone pads between the buttons and the PCB. First of all, there are very thin poles that help aligning the silicone pads. They do not have to hold against any force, but still you should be careful to not break them as they really help putting everything together. Second, the silicone pad of the A and B button has a somewhat complex line around the buttons that looks roughly like a figure eight with an additional outline. I did not reproduce the slit for the additional outline, which prevents it from being flush on the wood by default. You either have to add a carving for the outline or cut the outline from the silicone pad like I did with my aftermarket pads.</p>

<figcaption>Left: Placing the IPS mod display with buttons and silicone pads already in place. Right: The display PCB of the IPS mod screwed into the top half of the shell.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>For the display I decided against using an original screen<sup id="fnref:screen" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:screen" rel="footnote">8</a></sup> and picked up a modern <a href="https://retrohahn.com/collections/display/products/gameboy-classic-q5-osd" target="_blank">IPS mod kit</a> instead. Note, that I made a few simplifications and optimizations to my design to fit this display. In particular, the contrast wheel has an additional lip on the original Game Boy and there are additional posts at the top of the display which I did not model. I think that an original display also fits, but you might look into this if you want to use a different screen.</p>

<p>I did not find a good way to add a small pole right next to the large pole in the bottom left corner of the display (viewed from the inside). Unfortunately, the plastic holder for the display that comes with the kit uses this pole as one of four poles that hold it in place. However, it still seems to be very stable when using only three of those poles. The PCB of the kit can simply be screwed into the shell with original screws and holds very well with the 1mm holes I drilled here. Only problem is that the poles below the display split in the process. So,… well… I am not sure what to make of this. The PCB is held very securely, but I am not sure if I will eventually find cracks in the case from the other screws over time.</p>

<figcaption>Left: Both halves have to be connected with a ribbon cable. Right: Finally the glass cover from the IPS mod screen finishes the build.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Finally, all you need to do is to connect the two halves and glue the display cover into the screen bezel. There is just one major catch: For me the two halves were too tight and the screws could not properly hold them together. I am not sure if filing and sanding some parts for a better fit will help and if tapping the original screws into 1mm drill holes instead of the 1.5mm ones I have in the bottom half might be enough, but I only found a somewhat nasty solution: Gluing the case with wood glue.</p>

<figure>

<figcaption>Unfortunately, I had to glue both halves together, resulting in a slight gap and some glue residue.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>While I still love the resulting Game Boy and while it feels very solid and reliable, it bugs me a little to have a slight gap on one side and a bit of glue residue. If I ever want to reach the parts inside, I probably have to crack the case open, but at least no original parts had to be glued and could simply be replaced in the original Game Boy. Still, it would be nicer if I could just open the shell in case I ever need to do maintenance inside.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>When I started this project, I somewhat underestimated the amount of effort and time that had to go into it. But I also totally underestimated how stunning the result would be. At the moment it just sits on a sideboard in my office and I have to grin and pick it up each time I walk by it.</p>

<figcaption>I totally love how precisely some of the iconic designs of the original Game Boy could be reproduced.</figcaption>

<p>Initially, I planned to also machine the buttons out of a brighter type of wood. However, I did not find a good way to create a transparent display cover with matching wood applications and eventually settled for white aftermarket buttons and a matching display cover. Now that I see the result, I think that this was a good decision as it helps to define the shape and look.</p>

<figcaption>Even though the speaker grill did not go through in my build, the precision of those lines as well as the headphone jack cutout, totally blew me away. Too bad that the white painted labels did not turn out so well.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Also, the Game Boy plays quite well. If I am looking for any playability problem, maybe the buttons trigger a little bit below their tactile response point and I am not entirely certain if this is to be expected. But this Game Boy will not be my daily gaming platform anyways. This is meant to be presented somewhere. At the moment I am thinking of making an acrylic stand for it and use my <a href="https://there.oughta.be/a/wifi-game-boy-cartridge">WiFi cartridge</a> to use it as a status display in a prominent location.</p>

<figcaption>The Game Boy plays well, but I still think it is meant to be a showpiece and not a travel companion.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Oh, and if you have been wondering about the wooden Pokemon cartridges: Those are based on the <a href="https://github.com/Staacks/wooden-game-boy-cartridge" target="_blank">cartridge I published earlier</a> with several improvements to the toolpaths (man, I learned so much from the Game Boy project) and the Pokemon logo added. These versions are also in the <a href="https://github.com/Staacks/wooden-game-boy" target="_blank">GitHub repository for the wooden Game Boy</a>, but I did not add more documentation for it. If you got to this point, I am sure you can figure it out… :)</p>

<h3>from the <i>QWACs-in-the-web</i> dept</h3>

<p>The EU is currently updating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EIDAS">eIDAS</a> (electronic IDentification, Authentication and trust Services), an EU regulation on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the European Single Market. That’s clearly a crucial piece of legislation in the digital age, and updating it is sensible given the fast pace of development in the sector. But it seems that something bad has happened in the process. Back in March 2022, a group of experts sent an <a href="https://www.eff.org/files/2022/03/02/eidas_cybersecurity_community_open_letter_1_1.pdf">open letter to MEPs</a> [pdf] with the dramatic title “Global website security ecosystem at risk from EU Digital Identity framework’s new website authentication provisions”. It warned:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The Digital Identity framework includes provisions that are intended to increase the take-up of <strong>Qualified Website Authentication Certificates</strong> (QWACs), a specific EU form of website certificate that was created in the 2014 eIDAS regulation but which – owing to flaws with its technical implementation model – has not gained popularity in the web ecosystem. The Digital Identity framework mandates browsers accept QWACs issued by Trust Service Providers, <strong>regardless of the security characteristics of the certificates or the policies that govern their</strong> <strong>issuance</strong>. This legislative approach introduces significant weaknesses into the global multi-stakeholder ecosystem for securing web browsing, and will significantly increase the cybersecurity risks for users of the web.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The near-final text for eIDAS 2.0 has now been agreed by the EU’s negotiators, and it seems that it is even worse than the earlier draft. A new site from Mozilla called “<a href="https://last-chance-for-eidas.org/">Last Chance to fix eIDAS</a>” explains how new legislative articles will require all Web browsers in Europe to trust the the certificate authorities and cryptographic keys selected by the government of EU Member States. Mozilla explains:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>These changes radically expand the capability of EU governments to surveil their citizens by ensuring cryptographic keys under government control can be used to intercept encrypted web traffic across the EU. Any EU member state has the ability to designate cryptographic keys for distribution in web browsers and browsers are forbidden from revoking trust in these keys without government permission.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>This enables the government of any EU member state to issue website certificates for interception and surveillance which can be used against every EU citizen, even those not resident in or connected to the issuing member state. There is no independent check or balance on the decisions made by member states with respect to the keys they authorize and the use they put them to. This is particularly troubling given that adherence to the rule of law has <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/agenda/briefing/2022-05-02/6/rule-of-law-in-hungary-and-poland-plenary-debate-and-resolution">not been uniform</a> across all member states, with documented instances of <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20230524IPR91910/hungary-meps-denounce-deliberate-and-systematic-efforts-to-undermine-eu-values">coercion by secret police</a> for political purposes.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To make matters worse, browser producers will be forbidden from carrying out routine and necessary checks:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The text goes on to ban browsers from applying security checks to these EU keys and certificates except those pre-approved by the EU’s IT standards body – ETSI. This rigid structure would be problematic with any entity, but government-controlled standard bodies are especially susceptible to <a href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/nsas-subversion-nists-algorithm">misaligned incentives</a> in cryptography. ETSI in particular has both a <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/02/ets-isnt-tls-and-you-shouldnt-use-it">concerning</a> <a href="https://news.rub.de/english/press-releases/2021-06-16-it-security-backdoor-mobile-phone-encryption-90s-still-exists">track</a> <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/4a3n3j/backdoor-in-police-radios-tetra-burst">record</a> of producing compromised cryptographic standards and a <a href="https://www.etsi.org/committee/li">working group</a> dedicated entirely to developing interception technology.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/european-signature-dialog/">European Signature Dialog</a>, which aims “to connect major European Trust Service Providers to share best practices, develop a common industry viewpoint on regulatory issues and empower European solutions for guaranteed data-security,” disagrees with Mozilla’s analysis. In <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/european-signature-dialog_mozilla-campaign-pushes-serious-misinformation-activity-6978078620279824384-ByAc/">a post on LinkedIn</a> it writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Mozilla has recently launched a campaign that pushes serious misinformation about the current eIDAS legislation in order to block changes to Article 45 covering the EU’s Qualified Web Authentication Certificates (“QWACs”).</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A <a href="https://www.european-signature-dialog.eu/ESD_answer_to_Mozilla_misinformation_campaign.pdf">document</a> [pdf] from European Signature Dialog offers what it claims are refutations of Mozilla’s analysis. I will leave it to technical experts to decide who is right on the detailed points it discusses – for those interested in understanding the underlying technology, there’s an <a href="https://educatedguesswork.org/posts/eidas-article45/">excellent introduction to eIDAS and QWACs</a> from Eric Rescorla on the Educated Guesswork blog. But there’s a less technical issue too. Mozilla writes that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>forcing browsers to automatically trust government-backed certificate authorities is a key tactic used by authoritarian regimes, and these actors would be emboldened by the legitimising effect of the EU’s actions. In short, if this law were copied by another state, it could lead to serious threats to cybersecurity and fundamental rights.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To which European Signature Dialog responds:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The European Union is not controlling the “roots” used by the issuers of QWACs, and so the EU can’t use the certificates to “spy” on EU citizens. Mozilla should be ashamed of itself for suggesting this.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>While it may be true that the European Union itself is not controlling the roots, what Mozilla says is that the <strong>individual </strong><strong>governments of EU Member States</strong> will indeed be able to do precisely that, which means their intelligence services, for example, will be able to carry out <a href="https://last-chance-for-eidas.org/art45interception.html">surveillance of encrypted Web traffic</a>.</p>
<p>European Signature Dialog concludes its reply to Mozilla’s analysis by asking “Why is Mozilla spreading this misinformation”, and answering its own question with: “Mozilla is generally perceived as a Google satellite, paving the way for Google to push through its own commercial interests”. Attacking the motives of Mozilla in this way, suggesting that it is just some “satellite” of Google, suggests a lack of confidence in the other arguments the European Signature Dialog has offered.</p>
<p>Moreover, the insinuation that this is just an attempt by Google to head off some pesky EU legislation is undercut by the fact that separately from Mozilla, 335 scientists and researchers from 32 countries and various NGOs have signed a <a href="https://nce.mpi-sp.org/index.php/s/cG88cptFdaDNyRr">joint statement criticizing the proposed eIDAS reform</a>. If the latest text is adopted, they warn:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>the government-controlled authority would then be able to intercept the web traffic of not only their own citizens, but all EU citizens, including banking information, legally privileged information, medical records and family photos. This would be true even when visiting non-EU websites, as such an authority could issue certificates for any website that all browsers would have to accept. Additionally, although much of eIDAS2.0 regulation carefully gives citizens the capability to opt out from usage of new services and functionality, this is not the case for Article 45. Every citizen would have to trust those certificates, and thus every citizen would see their online safety threatened.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It concludes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>This regulation does not eliminate any existing risk. Instead, by undermining the existing secure web authentication processes, introduces new risks with no gain by European citizens, businesses, and institutions. Moreover, if this regulation becomes a reality, it is only to be expected that other countries will put pressure on browsers to obtain similar privileges as EU Member States — as <a href="https://censoredplanet.org/kazakhstan">some have unsuccessfully attempted in the past</a> — globally endangering web security.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Confirming the bad faith of the EU negotiators, these new and dangerous elements of eIDAS were added in closed-door meetings without any public consultation of experts. It’s a blatant power-grab by the EU, already attempting to circumvent encryption elsewhere with its <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/10/26/eu-pitched-client-side-scanning-by-targeting-certain-eu-residents-with-misleading-ads/">Chat Control</a> proposals. It must be stopped before it undermines core elements of the Internet’s security infrastructure not just in the EU, but globally too as result of its knock-on effects.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
		<h2>Harvard study, almost 80 years old, has proved that embracing community helps us live longer, and be happier</h2>	</p><div>

				<p><em>Second in an occasional <a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/topic/aging/">series</a> on how Harvard researchers are tackling the problematic issues of aging.</em></p>
<p><span>W</span>hen scientists began tracking the health of 268 Harvard sophomores in 1938 during the Great Depression, they hoped the longitudinal study would reveal clues to leading healthy and happy lives.</p>
<p>They got more than they wanted.</p>
<p>After following the surviving Crimson men for nearly 80 years as part of the <a href="http://www.adultdevelopmentstudy.org/">Harvard Study of Adult Development</a>, one of the world’s longest studies of adult life, researchers have collected a cornucopia of data on their physical and mental health.</p>
<p>Of the original Harvard cohort recruited as part of the Grant Study, only 19 are still alive, all in their mid-90s. Among the original recruits were eventual President John F. Kennedy and longtime Washington Post editor Ben Bradlee. (Women weren’t in the original study because the College was still all male.)</p>
<p>In addition, scientists eventually expanded their research to include the men’s offspring, who now number 1,300 and are in their 50s and 60s, to find out how early-life experiences affect health and aging over time. Some participants went on to become successful businessmen, doctors, lawyers, and others ended up as schizophrenics or alcoholics, but not on inevitable tracks.</p>
<p>During the intervening decades, the control groups have expanded. In the 1970s, 456 Boston inner-city residents were enlisted as part of the Glueck Study, and 40 of them are still alive. More than a decade ago, researchers began including wives in the Grant and Glueck studies.</p>
<p>Over the years, researchers have studied the participants’ health trajectories and their broader lives, including their triumphs and failures in careers and marriage, and the finding have produced startling lessons, and not only for the researchers.</p>
<p>“The surprising finding is that our relationships and how happy we are in our relationships has a powerful influence on our health,” said <a href="http://robertwaldinger.com/">Robert Waldinger</a>, director of the study, a psychiatrist at <a href="http://www.massgeneral.org/">Massachusetts General Hospital</a> and a professor of psychiatry at <a href="https://hms.harvard.edu/">Harvard Medical School</a>. “Taking care of your body is important, but tending to your relationships is a form of self-care too. That, I think, is the revelation.”</p>

<p>Close relationships, more than money or fame, are what keep people happy throughout their lives, the study revealed. Those ties protect people from life’s discontents, help to delay mental and physical decline, and are better predictors of long and happy lives than social class, IQ, or even genes. That finding proved true across the board among both the Harvard men and the inner-city participants.</p>
<p>The long-term research has received funding from private foundations, but has been financed largely by grants from the National Institutes of Health, first through the National Institute of Mental Health, and more recently through the National Institute on Aging.</p>

<p>Researchers who have pored through data, including vast medical records and hundreds of in-person interviews and questionnaires, found a strong correlation between men’s flourishing lives and their relationships with family, friends, and community. Several studies found that people’s level of satisfaction with their relationships at age 50 was a better predictor of physical health than their cholesterol levels were.</p>
<p>“When we gathered together everything we knew about them about at age 50, it wasn’t their middle-age cholesterol levels that predicted how they were going to grow old,” said Waldinger in a popular <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/robert_waldinger_what_makes_a_good_life_lessons_from_the_longest_study_on_happiness">TED Talk</a>. “It was how satisfied they were in their relationships. The people who were the most satisfied in their relationships at age 50 were the healthiest at age 80.”</p>

<p>He recorded his TED talk, titled “What Makes a Good Life? Lessons from the Longest Study on Happiness,” in 2015, and it has been viewed 13,000,000 times.</p>
<p>The researchers also found that marital satisfaction has a protective effect on people’s mental health. Part of a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2896234/">study</a> found that people who had happy marriages in their 80s reported that their moods didn’t suffer even on the days when they had more physical pain. Those who had unhappy marriages felt both more emotional and physical pain.</p>
<p>Those who kept warm relationships got to live longer and happier, said Waldinger, and the loners often died earlier. “Loneliness kills,” he said. “It’s as powerful as smoking or alcoholism.”</p>
<p>According to the study, those who lived longer and enjoyed sound health avoided smoking and alcohol in excess. Researchers also found that those with strong social support experienced less mental deterioration as they aged.</p>
<p>In part of a recent <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4579537/">study</a>, researchers found that women who felt securely attached to their partners were less depressed and more happy in their relationships two-and-a-half years later, and also had better memory functions than those with frequent marital conflicts.</p>


<p>“Good relationships don’t just protect our bodies; they protect our brains,” said Waldinger in his TED talk. “And those good relationships, they don’t have to be smooth all the time. Some of our octogenarian couples could bicker with each other day in and day out, but as long as they felt that they could really count on the other when the going got tough, those arguments didn’t take a toll on their memories.”</p>
<p>Since aging starts at birth, people should start taking care of themselves at every stage of life, the researchers say.</p>
<p>“Aging is a continuous process,” Waldinger said. “You can see how people can start to differ in their health trajectory in their 30s, so that by taking good care of yourself early in life you can set yourself on a better course for aging. The best advice I can give is ‘Take care of your body as though you were going to need it for 100 years,’ because you might.”</p>
<p>The study, like its remaining original subjects, has had a long life, spanning four directors, whose tenures reflected their medical interests and views of the time.</p>
<p>Under the first director, Clark Heath, who stayed from 1938 until 1954, the study mirrored the era’s dominant view of genetics and biological determinism. Early researchers believed that physical constitution, intellectual ability, and personality traits determined adult development. They made detailed anthropometric measurements of skulls, brow bridges, and moles, wrote in-depth notes on the functioning of major organs, examined brain activity through electroencephalograms, and even analyzed the men’s handwriting.</p>
<p>Now, researchers draw men’s blood for DNA testing and put them into MRI scanners to examine organs and tissues in their bodies, procedures that would have sounded like science fiction back in 1938. In that sense, the study itself represents a history of the changes that life brings.</p>
<p>Psychiatrist George Vaillant, who joined the team as a researcher in 1966, led the study from 1972 until 2004. Trained as a psychoanalyst, Vaillant emphasized the role of relationships, and came to recognize the crucial role they played in people living long and pleasant lives.</p>


<p>In a book called “Aging Well,” Vaillant wrote that six factors predicted healthy aging for the Harvard men: physical activity, absence of alcohol abuse and smoking, having mature mechanisms to cope with life’s ups and downs, and enjoying both a healthy weight and a stable marriage. For the inner-city men, education was an additional factor. “The more education the inner city men obtained,” wrote Vaillant, “the more likely they were to stop smoking, eat sensibly, and use alcohol in moderation.”</p>
<p>Vaillant’s research highlighted the role of these protective factors in healthy aging. The more factors the subjects had in place, the better the odds they had for longer, happier lives.</p>
<p>“When the study began, nobody cared about empathy or attachment,” said Vaillant. “But the key to healthy aging is relationships, relationships, relationships.”</p>
<p>The study showed that the role of genetics and long-lived ancestors proved less important to longevity than the level of satisfaction with relationships in midlife, now recognized as a good predictor of healthy aging. The research also debunked the idea that people’s personalities “set like plaster” by age 30 and cannot be changed.</p>
<p>“Those who were clearly train wrecks when they were in their 20s or 25s turned out to be wonderful octogenarians,” he said. “On the other hand, alcoholism and major depression could take people who started life as stars and leave them at the end of their lives as train wrecks.”</p>

<p>The study’s fourth director, Waldinger has expanded research to the wives and children of the original men. That is the second-generation study, and Waldinger hopes to expand it into the third and fourth generations. “It will probably never be replicated,” he said of the lengthy research, adding that there is yet more to learn.</p>
<p>“We’re trying to see how people manage stress, whether their bodies are in a sort of chronic ‘fight or flight’ mode,” Waldinger said. “We want to find out how it is that a difficult childhood reaches across decades to break down the body in middle age and later.”</p>
<p>Lara Tang ’18, a human and evolutionary biology concentrator who recently joined the team as a research assistant, relishes the opportunity to help find some of those answers. She joined the effort after coming across Waldinger’s TED talk in one of her classes.</p>
<p>“That motivated me to do more research on adult development,” said Tang. “I want to see how childhood experiences affect developments of physical health, mental health, and happiness later in life.”</p>
<p>Asked what lessons he has learned from the study, Waldinger, who is a Zen priest, said he practices meditation daily and invests time and energy in his relationships, more than before.</p>
<p>“It’s easy to get isolated, to get caught up in work and not remembering, ‘Oh, I haven’t seen these friends in a long time,’ ” Waldinger said. “So I try to pay more attention to my relationships than I used to.”</p>

Accessing code could also refer to them in their roles: maybe they are DevOps and their job is to wire up pipelines to deploy spaghetti to a giant furball k8s environment and they can’t because they can’t access their code.<p>Don’t be obtuse.

      <p>Incident with Git Operations, Issues, Pull Requests, Actions, API Requests, Codespaces, Packages, Pages and Webhooks</p>

          <div>
            <p><span>A performance and resilience optimization to the authorization microservice contained a memory leak that was exposed under high traffic. This resulted in a number of pages returning 404’s that should not have. Testing the build in our canary ring did not expose the service to sufficient traffic to discover the leak, allowing it to graduate to production at 6:37 PM UTC.  The memory leak under high load caused pods to crash repeatedly starting at 6:42 PM UTC, failing authorization checks. These failures triggered alerts at 6:44 PM UTC. Rolling back the authorization service change was delayed as parts of the deployment infrastructure relied on the authorization service and required manual intervention to complete. Rollback completed at 7:08 PM UTC and all impacted GitHub features recovered after pods came back online.  We are evaluating changes to our rollout strategy to better detect this sooner and with less impact, changes to remove the dependency between authorization services and deployment rollback, and incident response improvements to reduce the overall time to recover.<p>This incident is unrelated to the Slack integration incident.  The combined status updates are a limitation of our status reporting tooling and we recognize the confusion this creates. Work to address this was already in progress and will be complete this month.</p></span>

Their specific impulse is up to three times greater than chemical rockets, they produce comparable amounts of thrust and they could be designed to accept a variety of propellants, from CO2 to ammonia.

The idea to use nuclear energy to propel spacecraft dates back to 1944. Serious testing has been done on nuclear rockets, with ground tests in 1955 and functional gigawatt-scale rockets firing for several minutes by the 1970s. The Strategic Defense Initiative rekindled studies into nuclear propulsion with Project Timberwind, a program that ran until 1991 and resulted in modern designs that were even more capable.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p><span><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-AQ3-WzSAq7g/YWhILE6uBuI/AAAAAAAAFys/WQsiqD4Fc3M5YLd-_fIRCFIoyEJEPBcBwCNcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Copernicus_NTP_2500x1000.jpg"><img data-original-height="622" data-original-width="1600" height="248" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-AQ3-WzSAq7g/YWhILE6uBuI/AAAAAAAAFys/WQsiqD4Fc3M5YLd-_fIRCFIoyEJEPBcBwCNcBGAsYHQ/w640-h248/Copernicus_NTP_2500x1000.jpg" width="640"></a></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span>We are now in the midst of another revival of this technology.

Then, we would acquire the ability to send even heavier payloads to orbit and beyond.</span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span>The modern nuclear rocket</span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span>The design and performance targets for nuclear propulsion has shifted considerably over the last few decades. The initial efforts in the 1970s were straightforward in the desire for maximum power and thrust. </span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><a href="https://fas.org/nuke/space/la-10062.pdf"><span>Project Rover</span></a><span>, for example, resulted in the Phoebus-2A reactor that managed an output of 4000 MW for 12 minutes during a test run. As a fully developed engine, it would have managed 5000 MW and 825s of specific impulse. It would have held 300 kg of enriched uranium and had a relatively cool core temperature of 2300 K (although the goal was 2500 K). Total mass was 9300 kg, meaning it had an impressive power density of 537 kW/kg.</span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span>The ultimate version of this sort of maximum power engine would be the Pebble Bed reactors from the 1980s Strategic Defence Initiative era </span><a href="https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA305996.pdf"><span>Project Timberwind</span></a><span>. The largest version aimed to operate at 3000K to achieve a specific impulse of 1000s). 12,000 MW of power served to produce 2451 kN of thrust. Power density was a whopping 1450 kW/kg.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span>More recent nuclear thermal rockets have taken a different direction. Each rocket is smaller, aiming for a thrust level of around 100 kN. Multiples are used to ensure reliability during operation. Core temperatures are reduced to prolong engine life. With no hope of being used within an atmosphere, they are vacuum-only designs with a reduced focus on power density. Instead, additional capabilities such as the ability to produce electricity continuously are featured.&nbsp;</span></span></p><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-MUpf83Q9fI4/YWhKUkF93sI/AAAAAAAAFzU/enT5m7RBcVEEzf8N02sIVgi49a-Qr3OqACNcBGAsYHQ/s1326/16-Figure14-1.png"><img data-original-height="776" data-original-width="1326" height="374" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-MUpf83Q9fI4/YWhKUkF93sI/AAAAAAAAFzU/enT5m7RBcVEEzf8N02sIVgi49a-Qr3OqACNcBGAsYHQ/w640-h374/16-Figure14-1.png" width="640"></a></td></tr><tr><td>A <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Nuclear-Thermal-Propulsion-(NTP)%3A-A-proven-growth-Borowski-McCurdy/772072e3043c7e6ee50f8e420f4f3145e4c6d5e1">Copernicus</a> Mars vehicle equipped with three SNREs.</td></tr></tbody></table><p dir="ltr"><span><span>An example of this would be the</span><a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20120012928/downloads/20120012928.pdf"><span> ‘Borowski SNRE’</span></a><span> NERVA-derived design that produces 111 kN of thrust. When operated at 2800K, it achieves a specific impulse of 925s. Power density is about 152 kW/kg (504 MW for 3300 kg).</span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span>An even further diminished version of the SNRE is to be expected in the near future.

Five times more fuel in total would be needed to complete the same missions as with highly enriched uranium fuel, or a greatly increased amount of neutron reflector is necessary to surround the reactor core to achieve the same power output. Either way, the power density will suffer.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span>An additional aspect of nuclear thermal rocket development needs to be addressed: the choice of propellant. Nearly all tests and designs focus on the use of liquid hydrogen as it has the potential to deliver the highest specific impulse. However, other propellants </span><a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/19910012833/downloads/19910012833.pdf"><span>have been considered</span></a><span>, especially in the context of ISRU where spacecraft are refueled with whatever is available at their destination.

It is six times denser than liquid hydrogen, can be stored at 100K, which is compatible with liquid oxygen, and it can be produced using water and carbon dioxide. At high temperatures, it breaks down into hydrogen and carbon, turning it from a 16 g/mol molecule into a 3.25 g/mol plasma. That is how it achieves a specific impulse only mildly lower than what is achievable using liquid hydrogen. Zubrin lists its specific impulse as 606s when heated to 2800K, or 625s at 3000K.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span>Nuclear Starship</span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span>A nuclear-powered Starship would not be a complete overhaul of the design.</span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>It will still be a 50m tall steel tube that launches atop the SuperHeavy booster, using vacuum-optimized engines fed by large propellant tanks, and a set of smaller gimballed engines optimized for landing, with flaps to handle reentry. Dry mass in the final version will be 120 tons and about 30 tons of propellant is reserved for landing.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span>It might be unsurprising to you that we cannot simply bolt on nuclear rockets to the Starship and expect everything to work. Special modifications have to be made to accommodate the new propulsion system, ranging from new attachment points to control software, but we will focus on the most impactful one: radiation shielding.</span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span>The shape of the Starship is not well adapted to handling the radiation from a nuclear rocket. There are large flaps extending to the sides that could scatter radiation back into the crew compartment at the top. Retracting them when the nuclear rockets are in use would be a good idea. Designs which were meant to be nuclear from the start also usually place their reactor or nuclear rocket far from the main body of the spaceship, on the end of a long boom or tapered propellant tanks. Radiation released from a fission reaction spreads as a sphere in all directions - if it is placed further away, the main body of the spaceship intercepts a smaller fraction of it.&nbsp;</span></span></p><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-URnX-Zg2Ni8/YWhV2lx_OEI/AAAAAAAAF1M/-YzDaNRFfpkw_BYTGtaidqye4CQjbHdZwCNcBGAsYHQ/s907/rns_rear.PNG"><img data-original-height="698" data-original-width="907" height="492" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-URnX-Zg2Ni8/YWhV2lx_OEI/AAAAAAAAF1M/-YzDaNRFfpkw_BYTGtaidqye4CQjbHdZwCNcBGAsYHQ/w640-h492/rns_rear.PNG" width="640"></a></td></tr><tr><td>The ideal rear end of a nuclear-propelled spacecraft, based on the <a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/19720009983/downloads/19720009983.pdf">RNS</a>.</td></tr></tbody></table><p dir="ltr"><span>The fraction of radiation that cannot be avoided is handled using radiation shielding, with different layers meant to absorb different types of radiation. It is placed as close as possible to the reactors or engines to create the widest shadow of protection, which is why they are also called shadow shields.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>A fission reaction mainly produces fission fragments, gamma rays and neutrons. Fission fragments are heavy ions that do not travel very far. Gamma rays are penetrating photons that are best absorbed by a dense material. Neutrons are high velocity subatomic particles with no charge; they are best dealt with using a material that contains as much hydrogen as possible, like water.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span>We want to use as little </span><a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20150006884/downloads/20150006884.pdf"><span>shielding mass</span></a><span> as possible.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p><span><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-A6X9mZ0m9ls/YWhO7P-8iuI/AAAAAAAAF0E/blL1jCnc-eglru5nn1qUJoSWjduUGJxOACNcBGAsYHQ/s987/risk1.PNG"><img data-original-height="987" data-original-width="716" height="640" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-A6X9mZ0m9ls/YWhO7P-8iuI/AAAAAAAAF0E/blL1jCnc-eglru5nn1qUJoSWjduUGJxOACNcBGAsYHQ/w464-h640/risk1.PNG" width="464"></a></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span>The densest elements are the best protection against gamma rays, with tungsten (W) being an ideal choice (lead would melt too easily and depleted uranium is not practical).&nbsp;</span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span>Lithium Hydride (LiH) is the most mass-efficient protection against neutrons. Boron Carbide (B4C) is 20% heavier than LiH for the same protection, but it melts at 3036K is a very strong ceramic, which is ideal for surfaces exposed to reentry heating.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span>It must be noted that some radiation protection is already built-in. The beryllium or graphite reflector within the nuclear reactor prevents some radiation from leaving. The 30 tons or more of landing propellant, especially methane, is effective at absorbing neutrons too and will always be present while in space. A much larger load of propellant will be drained as the nuclear propulsion is used, representing several meters of shielding. Furthermore, there will be a 25 meter separation between the engines and the crew compartment, so only 1/625 of the radiation is actually intercepted.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><a href="https://alternatewars.com/BBOW/Space_Engines/AIAA-2004-3863_TRITON.pdf"><span>Different</span></a><span> </span><a href="http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/radiation.php#id--Radiation_Shielding--Shielding--Shadow_Shield"><span>estimates</span></a><span> for the shielding required place the total at about 440 kg/m^2, which corresponds to 2 cm tungsten plus 2 cm of Boron Carbide. The engines themselves are about 1 meter wide, whether they produce 500 MW or 5000 MW of power, so the shielding to be added to each engine is about 345 kg. Perhaps this estimate is optimistic, but we can rely on all the previously mentioned protections to make up for any deficiency. Consider also that the effectiveness of radiation shielding is not linear but improves exponentially with its thickness - it is easy to adjust protection levels.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span>Finally, there would be significant changes to be made to supply propellant to nuclear rocket engines. We would extend them to take up the volume currently occupied by liquid oxygen. We won’t be changing the total volume of propellant tanks available to us, for a fair comparison with other versions of the Starship. If we selected liquid hydrogen, we would need specially designed tanks with insulation and active cooling. If we feed the nuclear rockets with liquid methane, we can use the same type of propellant tanks as exists today.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span>The propellant tanks dedicated to landing would also have to be changed. A nuclear Starship is expected to have a heavier dry mass, so more propellant is needed to land it, which means larger tanks.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span>With all these modifications in mind, let’s dive into the numbers.</span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span>Performance analysis</span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span>We will calculate the performance of a SpaceX starship equipped with nuclear propulsion.</span></span><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0IG6v_xCgXQ/YWhPg6tMvsI/AAAAAAAAF0M/q7xeWcFIqosTCp8HpOCpY2gTiGcWgqzCQCNcBGAsYHQ/s1554/starship1.PNG"><img data-original-height="734" data-original-width="1554" height="302" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0IG6v_xCgXQ/YWhPg6tMvsI/AAAAAAAAF0M/q7xeWcFIqosTCp8HpOCpY2gTiGcWgqzCQCNcBGAsYHQ/w640-h302/starship1.PNG" width="640"></a></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span>Two nuclear rockets are considered: a 150 kW/kg near-term design operating at 2800K, and a 1000 kW/kg far-term design operating at 3000K.

We will consider the use of traditional hydrogen propellant as well as the methane alternative, and either try to match the accelerations possible with chemical rockets or aim for a lower performance.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span>To begin, let’s begin by breaking down the existing Starship design.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span>It has three vacuum Raptors massing 1.87 tons each, three sea-level Raptors massing 1.11 tons each.

Having a Starship stage that is too lightweight means the SuperHeavy booster reaches extreme velocities that a boostback burn cannot sufficiently reduce, and without any form of thermal protection, it could become too damaged to land itself. Preventing this means reserving more propellant for the boostback burn, but this in turn means the Starship stage is released at a lower velocity.

The fuel becomes intensely radioactive. After shutdown, up to 1% of the maximum power output keeps getting released. That’s several megawatts in this case. It falls off rapidly, but radiation levels near the engine would remain lethal for days and harmful for weeks. Remember, it is unshielded around the sides and rear, so there is no protection for someone coming from those angles. NASA estimates that a nuclear rocket engine returns to its ‘safe’ state after a month.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Rapid reuse becomes complicated. Discharging the payload to orbit and then reentering means the nuclear engines are still ‘hot’ after landing. Even if the landing itself is performed with chemical Raptor engines rather than with active nuclear engines, the residual radioactivity means that any ground crew would need to be fully protected, the refueling facilities will all have to be shielded and adding a new payload then stacking it back on top of a Superheavy Booster without contaminating them become very difficult tasks.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span>Even in space, where we don’t mind irradiating the empty environment, there are issues. Approaching the International Space Station becomes impossible unless the Starship ‘cools down’ for a month in orbit. Docking maneuvers between a Starship and the craft meant to refuel it have to be done along a narrow corridor between each ship’s radiation shadows. Moon landings take place about 3 days after departure from orbit and the use of the main engines. Nuclear rockets would still be ‘hot’ by then and dangerous to any astronaut approaching from the surface. They would have to land far away from any lunar bases, and rely on shielded rovers to transfer payload across the Moon’s surface across a safe distance. The lack of any air to grant free radiation shielding means this safe distance will be very large.</span></span></p><p><span><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ShY5DCmDM_k/YWhX2VAEb0I/AAAAAAAAF1s/_ksBS-6WdwQmkMEbzbrNfoYbtB9Skv-IACNcBGAsYHQ/s2549/Starship-2019-Mars-reentry-render-SpaceX-1-crop-3-c.jpg"><img data-original-height="1175" data-original-width="2549" height="296" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ShY5DCmDM_k/YWhX2VAEb0I/AAAAAAAAF1s/_ksBS-6WdwQmkMEbzbrNfoYbtB9Skv-IACNcBGAsYHQ/w640-h296/Starship-2019-Mars-reentry-render-SpaceX-1-crop-3-c.jpg" width="640"></a></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span>It is less of an issue for Mars missions. Even the shortest missions take more than 2 months and this gives enough time for the nuclear rocket engines to become safe again.

But this is necessarily a smaller number of missions compared to the Earth-Earth or Earth-Moon missions.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span>And finally, there’s the ISRU.</span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span>Martian Starships return to Earth after being refilled by propellant produced by CO2 and water found locally. Vast fields of solar panels or fission reactors produce electricity to crack these molecules and reform them into oxygen and methane. A methane nuclear Starship needs nearly three times as much methane than a chemical Starship. It needs no oxygen, but that is a byproduct of the reaction that produces methane anyway - it is not a true saving. Three times more methane means that ISRU facilities have to be three times bigger or refuel three times less Starships, a hefty penalty.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span>Can the Nuclear Starship be saved?</span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span>It is possible to envision a nuclear Starship in the far future. Someone else decides to develop the necessary methane-propelled propulsion technology. Perhaps the basic Starship is adapted to carry more propellant volume, increasing overall mass ratios and making full use of the increased exhaust velocity.

<p>Identity and authentication management provider Okta has been hit by another breach, this one against a third-party vendor that allowed hackers to steal personal information for 5,000 Okta employees.</p>
<p>The compromise was carried out in late September against Rightway Healthcare, a service Okta uses to support employees and their dependents in finding health care providers and plan rates. An unidentified threat actor gained access to Rightway’s network and made off with an eligibility census file the vendor maintained on behalf of Okta. Okta learned of the compromise and data theft on October 12 and didn’t disclose it until Thursday, exactly three weeks later.</p>
<p>“The types of personal information contained in the impacted eligibility census file included your Name, Social Security Number, and health or medical insurance plan number,” a <a href="https://apps.web.maine.gov/online/aeviewer/ME/40/08edf96f-d599-4db9-9e1f-52453c0ba058/22d1a94b-6042-4961-914c-a043b36ae79b/document.html">letter</a> sent to affected Okta employees stated. “We have no evidence to suggest that your personal information has been misused against you.”</p>
<p>The letter, which is the first time the event has been disclosed, said that Okta opened an investigation immediately after learning of it. The investigation revealed that data for <a href="https://apps.web.maine.gov/online/aeviewer/ME/40/08edf96f-d599-4db9-9e1f-52453c0ba058.shtml">4,961 Okta employees</a> was included in the stolen file.</p>
<p>In an email, an Okta representative said that based on information Rightway provided, the intruder first gained access to a Rightway employee’s cell phone and then used that access to change credentials and take the files. The files, which were from April 2019 through 2020, were exfiltrated from Rightway’s IT environment. The personal information pertained to Okta employees and their dependents from 2019 and 2020. Okta also said that Rightway informed it that the compromise involved multiple Rightway customers.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>“This incident does not relate to the use of Okta services and Okta services remain secure,” the representative said. “No Okta customer data is impacted by this incident.”</p>
<p>Rightway representatives didn’t immediately respond to an email seeking comment and additional details about the breach.</p>
<p>Thursday’s disclosure comes two weeks after Okta <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2023/10/okta-says-hackers-breached-its-support-system-and-viewed-customer-files/">revealed</a> that hackers compromised its customer support system and obtained credentials that allowed them to take control of customers’ internal Okta administration accounts. The attackers then used those credentials in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2023/10/1password-detects-suspicious-activity-in-its-internal-okta-account/">follow-on hacks</a> that targeted the internal administration accounts of 1Password, BeyondTrust, Cloudflare, and possibly other customers.
</p><p>Okta is based in San Francisco and provides cloud identity, access management for single sign-on, multifactor authentication, and API services to thousands of organizations worldwide. The company has previously come under criticism for security breaches and its handling of them afterward. Most recently, Cloudflare called out Okta for not driving the intruders out of its network until October 18, 16 days after first learning of the compromise. Cloudflare urged Okta to act quicker in the future when learning of security breaches, providing disclosures sooner and requiring the use of hardware keys to protect internal systems and systems used by third-party support providers.</p>
<p>“For a critical security service provider like Okta, we believe following these best practices is table stakes,” Cloudflare researchers <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-cloudflare-mitigated-yet-another-okta-compromise/">wrote</a>.</p>
<p>The Okta representative said in Thursday’s email that when the company learned of the Rightway compromise on October 12, investigators had 27,000 records to sort through. Much of the process had to be manually done and took time to complete.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				
<h2>Introduction</h2>



<p>This post will provide some background information on video codecs and the pros and cons of the most common codecs used by streaming services. We’ll discuss why you should be taking advantage of newer codecs and the many benefits they can provide. Finally, we’ll provide a step-by-step guide through the factors and questions you should consider when evaluating or adding <a href="https://bitmovin.com/av1" data-type="link" data-id="https://bitmovin.com/av1">AV1</a> encoding to your workflow.</p>







<h2>What are video codecs?</h2>



<p>The word codec is a combination of the words coder and decoder. Video codecs are used to reduce or compress the size of video files for storage and transmission, because raw source files produced by professional studios or cameras use too much data to be delivered smoothly over the internet. For video streaming purposes, the master file or live source is encoded for transmission, then decoded for playback on the end-user device. This encoding typically involves lossy compression, meaning the overall file size is reduced, often significantly, with a tradeoff of slightly lower visual quality. How noticeable that quality reduction is and the amount of data compression possible depends on the codec and settings that were used.</p>







<h2>What is the best video codec?</h2>



<p>Like with many technical questions, the frustrating, but most accurate answer is “It depends.” Each codec has its own pros and cons in terms of cost, performance and support, so the best codec (or codecs) can differ based on your company’s goals, applications and business model. Let’s take a closer look at some of the high level pros and cons of the most common codecs used by streaming platforms.</p>







<h3>H.264/AVC</h3>



<p>👍 –&nbsp; Almost universal playback compatibility with nearly 20 years in the field.&nbsp;</p>



<p>👎 –&nbsp; It’s almost 20 years old, and several newer codecs offer better compression and can produce higher quality video while using less data, providing a better viewing experience and reducing your long-term storage and delivery costs.&nbsp;</p>







<h3>H.265/HEVC</h3>



<p>👍 –&nbsp; MPEG’s successor to H.264/AVC can provide higher quality per bit and makes it possible to deliver HD,&nbsp; 4K and even 8K video to a wider audience, while using less bandwidth. H.265/HEVC is usually encoded with a higher bit depth than H.264/AVC, making high dynamic range (HDR) support possible, so most Dolby Vision streaming workflows use H.265/HEVC.</p>



<p>👎 – Royalty fees and complex licensing terms for H.265/HEVC have led some content creators and streaming services to avoid it. There are multiple patent pools, along with some individual companies that claim to own patents covering essential parts of the standard, creating uncertainty for end users around their liability and obligations.</p>







<h3>VP9&nbsp;</h3>



<p>👍 – Google’s open source VP9 is a royalty-free alternative to H.265/HEVC with similar performance in terms of compression efficiency. Platforms like YouTube and Facebook use VP9 to offer higher resolution video than H.264/AVC and improve video quality over low bandwidth, which is especially important for viewing on mobile devices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>👎 – VP9 is over 10 years old and while it is still widely used and supported, most of the current innovation and new development is focused on its successor, AV1.</p>







<h3>AV1</h3>



<p>👍 – AV1 offers the best compression performance of any of the codecs discussed here. On average it can achieve the same visual quality using ~50% less data than H.264/AVC and ~30% less data than H.265/HEVC and VP9. Those are significant savings that really add up over time and millions of views. YouTube and Netflix both use AV1 for their most popular HD and 4K content as a way to enable high-res viewing for people on slower connections, improving quality of experience and drastically reducing data usage, which lowers their egress and CDN costs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>👎 – Even though it’s a few years old, adoption of AV1 has been lagging behind initial expectations, mostly because of slower than expected rollout of playback and decoding support. Because of that, anyone encoding with AV1 will still need to provide backup H.264/AVC streams in the near future. However, recently launched products like the iPhone 15 Pro, Apple’s M3 desktop processor and the Meta Quest 3 headset all include AV1 decoding support, so hopefully the tide is turning and AV1 adoption will ramp up in the coming months.</p>

<h2>Why should I use newer codecs?</h2>



<p>In general, newer codecs provide better compression efficiency than their predecessors, using less bits to deliver the same level of quality. They can also support higher resolutions and wider color and contrast ranges than earlier generations. This has multiple benefits for streaming services and their viewers.</p>







<h3>Better visual quality at lower bitrates</h3>



<p>When delivering video to mobile phones, to viewers on shared, congested wifi or in areas with limited bandwidth, the tradeoff between quality and bitrate becomes especially apparent. This is where the compression performance of newer codecs can really stand out. Using a newer codec like AV1 can mean the difference between acceptable quality and a pixelated mess as you can see in the screenshot below from Facebook.</p>

<h3>Improved quality of experience and less buffering for all viewers</h3>



<p>It’s not just the low bitrate streams where newer codecs can improve quality of experience. The ability to deliver higher quality with less bits improves QoE across all adaptive bitrate renditions. At Demuxed 2023, Netflix reported that using AV1 not only reduced network bandwidth, but also lowered rebuffer rates and play start delay, while providing up to 38% reduction in quality drops compared to other codecs. They were also able to improve VMAF quality scores by up to 10 points with AV1.&nbsp;</p>







<h3>Higher resolutions and more advanced features</h3>



<p>H.264/AVC can technically be used for HD and 4K encoding, but you typically need extremely high bitrates to achieve the quality viewers expect from HD and UHD content. These higher bitrates can lead to more rebuffering and QoE issues, not to mention higher prices for storage and delivery. Most H.264/AVC workflows are limited to 8-bit encoding and decoding, which means it can’t really be used for HDR. H.265/HEVC, VP9 and AV1 can all handle 4K and 8K resolutions and support 10-bit and higher encoding, making them a better choice for premium content tiers. Netflix reported that using AV1 led to a 5% increase in 4K streaming time, so it can make a meaningful difference for the viewing experience and how your platform is perceived by users.&nbsp;</p>







<h3>Long term cost savings</h3>



<p>In addition to improving QoE, the better compression performance and lower bitrates required by newer codecs will also save you money over the lifetime of your video content. Even though the encoding is more complex and may cost a little more up front, the smaller file sizes can reduce your storage footprint and drastically cut your bandwidth on network egress and CDN delivery charges. For popular content receiving tens of thousands or millions of views, the overall savings can be substantial.</p>







<h2>Should I use more than one codec?</h2>



<p>This could potentially be another frustrating “It depends” question, but in most cases, the answer here is “Yes, you probably should”. Using H.264/AVC together with at least one newer codec ensures you have video that is backward compatible and available for everyone, while providing a higher quality viewing experience for those on newer devices with more advanced codec support. YouTube for example, encodes content in H.264/AVC, VP9 and AV1. Netflix uses H.264/AVC and AV1 for standard dynamic range content and H.265/HEVC for Dolby Vision. The right combination for your business will depend on your target viewing platforms, output quality, and business model. The step-by-step guide below will focus on AV1, but the same questions and steps could also be applied to other codecs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>







<h2>Step-by-step guide to adding AV1 encoding:</h2>







<h3>1. Determine how AV1 can help your business goals and viewer experience</h3>



<p>Adding a new codec can be beneficial in many ways as discussed above, but it’s a big decision and should be made with deliberate intentions and goals in mind. What is it that you want to achieve by adding a new codec to your encoding stack?&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>Quality improvement on mobile devices or areas with limited bandwidth?&nbsp;</li>



<li>Long term reduction of storage, egress, and CDN delivery costs?&nbsp;</li>



<li>Making premium 4K and HDR tiers available to a broader audience?&nbsp;</li>



<li>Improving QoE and reducing buffering across your platform?&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>AV1 can help in all of those areas, and you can fine tune your implementation to achieve your specific objectives.</p>







<h2>2. Project Total Cost of Ownership (TCO), savings and revenue potential</h2>



<p>AV1 is more complex to encode and can cost a little more in terms of computing power and encoding time. But the significant bandwidth savings it provides over H.264/AVC mean that in most cases, this initial cost will be more than offset by the longer term egress and CDN savings, giving you a lower TCO over the lifetime of each video. The actual break-even point will depend on your own contracts and delivery costs, so we created this <a href="https://bitmovin.com/demos/av1-break-even-calculator">calculator</a> to help forecast where you might begin to see overall savings by adding AV1.</p>

<p>Besides lowering TCO for your video, AV1 can actually help generate revenue and retain subscribers. Its lower bitrate requirements for HD and 4K content mean that it can grow your total addressable market for higher quality upsell tiers. It can also help reduce subscriber churn by lowering rebuffering rates and providing a generally better quality of experience for your viewers.&nbsp;</p>







<h2>3. Utilize cloud-native encoding and analytics for fast, risk-free evaluation</h2>



<p>Some on-premises encoders may require a pricey license upgrade to support AV1 encoding and in other cases, you’ll need to purchase a new appliance or hardware. You can avoid those high up-front costs that may stifle innovation by using a cloud encoding service that lets you pay on a usage basis. Even better, with Bitmovin’s <a href="https://bitmovin.com/encoding-service/cloud-native-advantage/">cloud-native</a> encoding, you can try it for free with our <a href="https://dashboard.bitmovin.com/signup?">30-day trial</a>.

<h2>4. Accelerate proof-of-concepts with content-aware, Per-Title Encoding</h2>



<p>AV1 is more complex to configure than previous generations of codecs and many technicians and engineers have spent years developing expertise with H.264, so there may be some reluctance or lack of time to fully dive into the details of a new codec configuration. You can overcome that obstacle by taking advantage of a content-aware encoding service, like Bitmovin’s <a href="https://bitmovin.com/encoding-service/per-title-encoding/">Per-Title Encoding</a>. Each file is automatically analyzed for complexity and the ideal adaptive bit-rate encoding ladder is generated for each piece of content, with no advanced knowledge or configuration of AV1 required. This not only simplifies the process, it will save you on storage costs by eliminating unnecessary renditions from your adaptive bitrate ladder and ensure you’re making the most efficient use of data on the delivery and playback side.&nbsp;</p>







<h2>5. Deploy with most popular content for early ROI&nbsp;</h2>



<p>One thing to keep in mind for AV1 deployment is that you don’t need to take an all-or-nothing approach. Some of the earliest adopters like YouTube and Netflix initially only encoded their most popular content with AV1, since that is where the delivery costs were highest and they could maximize their returns on the initial encoding investment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this <a href="https://www.analysysmason.com/netflix-open-connect" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">study</a> released by Netflix, analysts found that 21% of content streamed in one month in early 2022 benefited from the most recent improvements in codec efficiency (Per-Title HEVC and AV1). Without those improvements, they estimated that total Netflix traffic globally would have been around 24% higher. That’s a pretty solid proof point that using Per-Title AV1 with even a portion of your most popular content can make a big difference for overall data usage and cost. As of October 2023, Netflix reported that over 30% their catalog has now been encoded with AV1, with more being backfilled daily, and AV1 encoding is enabled for all new videos ingested to their platform. That shows they’ve now seen the value and potential benefits of AV1 make it worth adopting even beyond the most viewed content.&nbsp;</p>







<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>In a crowded marketplace where viewers have many options, taking advantage of newer codecs can help streaming services stand out with a better quality of experience for their viewers, while saving themselves money in the background. Which codecs provide the most benefit will depend on each service provider’s goals, business model and target devices, but it’s clear that evolving beyond H.264 alone is necessary to provide best-in-class streaming experiences. In addition to better quality, adding newer codecs like AV1 can help relieve the financial burden of higher egress and CDN costs that come with increased popularity. Making an investment in upgrading codecs now will pay dividends for years to come.&nbsp;</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="auto"><p>Every profession has its own dance with disaster. Physicians’ diagnosis, accountants’ audit, and writers? They proofread. But for us software developers, we engage in a peculiar kind of sorcery known as "debugging." It’s a delicate art that lets us wade through the rivers of time, witnessing the world through the eyes of a computer, understanding our coded creations at every step.</p><p>The Friday before it all began had an air of triumph about it. I leaned back in my swivel chair and announced to my boss with a confident smile, "The geolocated photos feature is ready to launch on Monday." I'd poured my coder's soul into our React Native mobile app, meticulously testing it on Android and the iOS beta - it seemed flawless. It wasn’t.</p><p>But what I'm about to tell you isn't just a story. It's a descent into a week-long abyss from 2016, when the magical toolset for debugging turned its back on me, leaving me to navigate the labyrinth of my own code, blind. This is a tale of digital ghosts in the machine, and the relentless hunt that ensued to exorcise them. It’s also a story about good people.</p><p>After releasing the Android beta, I was surprised and confused: the images simply wouldn't upload. A conundrum wrapped in an enigma, especially given the seamless performance on Android in the sanctuary of my local testing environment, not to mention the iOS beta that sprinted without so much as a hiccup.</p><p>I re-uploaded a version with improved error handling, but image uploads were failing without any feedback. You see, normally code screams its errors at you in red text - silence is the goal. Here silence was the problem.</p><p>Each new iteration of the app, laden with potential solutions, demanded an hour to upload to the Play Store before it could face judgment. Like clockwork, I uploaded new guesses while I prepared for the next. I was running out of ideas and under pressure to deliver.</p><p>By the second day, I was reminded that insanity is doing the same thing repeatedly and expecting different results. Nothing was working.</p><p>A kindred spirit, one of the embedded engineers approached me. "I know how you feel. I've been there."</p><p>"Oh?" I replied.</p><p>He explained, "We regularly ship firmware updates to remote equipment. Once in a while, a node would become unresponsive after an update."</p><p>Curious, I asked, "So how do you figure out what went wrong?"</p><p>He replied, "We have to remotely retrieve the equipment and have it sent back to us for analysis. Sometimes, it takes months to determine what might have gone wrong."</p><p>Realizing that my feedback loops were significantly shorter, I felt better knowing that at least I could put out a number of attempts each day. </p><p>By Wednesday, a seed of doubt had started growing in my mind. I started to question if software development was the right career path for me.</p><p>One of the sympathetic hardware engineers approached me. "I know how you feel. I've been there."</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>"We often release new hardware remotely, hoping it will remain functional for years. But sometimes design flaws in the hardware only become apparent after enduring multiple seasons. Things break."</p><p>"So, how do you figure out what went wrong?" I asked.</p><p>"We receive old equipment through the mail, and we attempt to incorporate fixes for the next generations. However, there are times when we add a feature and it turns out to be an even worse bug. One time we added ventilation holes to reduce heat, but they were just big enough for wasps to nest in. We can conduct tests in the lab, but the ultimate test is out in the field."</p><p>I started to realize how ambiguous problems were much more of a challenge. Maybe mobile development wasn’t so bad - at least my code either worked or didn’t.</p><p>By Thursday, I began to worry about my own job security. I had been spinning on a feature I said I would ship 3 days ago.</p><p>The CEO approached and sat down at my desk. I expected the worst. "I understand how you feel, I've been there”.</p><p>"Oh?" I asked, surprised.</p><p>"Before I started this company, I was a chemist working on my PhD dissertation," he explained. "I was granted a large amount of funding for an expensive chemical to conduct a series of experiments. But weeks into the experiments, it appeared that the results had failed due to experimental error."</p><p>"So, how did you figure out what went wrong?" I asked.</p><p>"I didn't.” My CEO continued, “When they asked me what I would do differently to prevent repeating the error, I couldn't even provide an answer. Somehow, and to my surprise, I still received the second round of funding."</p><p>I fully expected to be in trouble for delaying delivery. I’ve found few leaders demonstrate a level of empathy to bring you back up when you’re feeling down.</p><p>On Thursday evening, I went out for sushi with some friends and shared my recent frustration with them.</p><p>One of my veterinarian friends chimed in, "I know exactly how you feel. I had a similar problem today."</p><p>"Oh, really?" I asked.</p><p>She continued, "Earlier today, an owner brought in their elderly, sick dog. I suggested taking an x-ray, but the owner declined due to the cost."</p><p>"So, how did you figure out what was wrong with the dog?"</p><p>She replied, "The best I could do was feel the dog's stomach from the outside. I felt something large. We performed surgery to remove what turned out to be a corn cob, but without an x-ray, I can’t even be sure that was the extent of the problem."</p><p>For the past week, I had been hyper-focused on getting this mobile app out the door, as if nothing else mattered. But I needed to remind myself that, in the big picture, software development isn't usually about life-or-death situations. The stakes aren't typically that high.</p><p>By Friday morning, I noticed a discrepancy in the Android docs and my codebase. What had caused me to spin in circles for a week? A single character.</p><p>I sent a message to my friend, "Cracked it at last. It was the letter 'E'."</p><blockquote><p><span>For the curious, the image mime type was set to "jpg" but should have been"jpeg" - even though the files were saved as `.jpg`. (See </span><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33692835/is-the-mime-type-image-jpg-the-same-as-image-jpeg" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Stack Overflow</a><span> for details). </span></p></blockquote><p>She texted back, "Appreciate the update. I needed a bit of positivity today."</p><p>I frowned, puzzled. "Why, what's up?"</p><p>Her response was simple and somber: "The corn cob dog passed away this morning."</p><p>Perhaps software development wasn’t right for me, but it didn’t seem like other professions looked much better.</p><p>As software developers, it’s easy to overlook the privileges we enjoy. We have the unique ability to delve deep into intricate processes, monitor real-time activities, log what’s happening, and even pause time with a debugger. This remarkable capability is not only cheap but fast, bordering on thoughtless.</p><p>While many other professions struggle to understand and resolve their issues, we have the advantage of being able to experiment multiple times a day with just a few clicks. </p><p>I am grateful every day for the debugging tools that we have at our disposal.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>No one had ever seen one virus latching onto another virus, until anomalous sequencing results sent a UMBC team down a rabbit hole leading to a first-of-its-kind discovery.</p>



<p>It’s known that some viruses, called satellites, depend not only on their host organism to complete their life cycle, but also on another virus, known as a “helper,” explains<a href="https://erilllab.umbc.edu/"> <strong>Ivan Erill</strong></a>, professor of biological sciences. The satellite virus needs the helper either to build its capsid, a protective shell that encloses the virus’s genetic material, or to help it replicate its DNA. These viral relationships require the satellite and the helper to be in proximity to each other at least temporarily, but there were no known cases of a satellite actually attaching itself to a helper—until now.</p>



<p>In a paper <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41396-023-01548-0" rel="noopener">published in the <em>Journal of the International Society of Microbial Ecology</em></a>, a UMBC team and colleagues from Washington University in St. Louis (WashU) describe the first observation of a satellite bacteriophage (a virus that infects bacterial cells) consistently attaching to a helper bacteriophage at its “neck”—where the capsid joins the tail of the virus.</p>



<p>In detailed electron microscopy images taken by<a href="https://biology.umbc.edu/directory/faculty/person/od04934/"> <strong>Tagide deCarvalho</strong></a>, assistant director of the <a href="https://cnms.umbc.edu/core-facilities/">College of Natural and Mathematical Sciences core facilities</a> and first author on the new paper, 80 percent (40 out of 50) helpers had a satellite bound at the neck. Some of those that did not had remnant satellite tendrils present at the neck. Erill, senior author on the paper, describes them as appearing like “bite marks.”</p>



<p>“When I saw it, I was like, ‘I can’t believe this,’” deCarvalho says. “No one has ever seen a bacteriophage—or any other virus—attach to another virus.”</p>

<h4><strong>A long-term virus relationship</strong></h4>



<p>After the initial observations, <strong>Elia Mascolo</strong>, a graduate student in Erill‘s research group and co-first author on the paper, analyzed the genomes of the satellite, helper, and host, which revealed further clues about this never-before-seen viral relationship. Most satellite viruses contain a gene that allows them to integrate into the host cell’s genetic material after they enter the cell. This allows the satellite to reproduce whenever a helper happens to enter the cell from then on. The host cell also copies the satellite’s DNA along with its own when it divides.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="681" height="1024" src="https://umbc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Ivan_Erill_biology_6873-1-681x1024.jpg" alt="headshot of man in blue-gray t-shirt, greenery in background." srcset="https://umbc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Ivan_Erill_biology_6873-1-681x1024.jpg 681w, https://umbc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Ivan_Erill_biology_6873-1-199x300.jpg 199w, https://umbc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Ivan_Erill_biology_6873-1-768x1155.jpg 768w, https://umbc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Ivan_Erill_biology_6873-1-1021x1536.jpg 1021w, https://umbc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Ivan_Erill_biology_6873-1.jpg 1290w" sizes="(max-width: 681px) 100vw, 681px"><figcaption>Ivan Erill co-leads the SEA-PHAGES program at UMBC.

<p>A bacteriophage sample from WashU also contained a helper and a satellite. The WashU satellite has a gene for integration and does not directly attach to its helper, similar to previously observed satellite-helper systems.</p>



<p>However, the satellite in UMBC’s sample, named MiniFlayer by the students who isolated it, is the first known case of a satellite with no gene for integration. Because it can’t integrate into the host cell’s DNA, it must be near its helper—named MindFlayer—every time it enters a host cell if it is going to survive. Given that, although the team did not directly prove this explanation, “Attaching now made total sense,” Erill says, “because otherwise, how are you going to guarantee that you are going to enter into the cell at the same time?”</p>



<p>Additional bioinformatics analysis by Mascolo and <strong>Julia López-Pérez</strong>, another Ph.D. student working with Erill, revealed that MindFlayer and MiniFlayer have been co-evolving for a long time. “This satellite has been tuning in and optimizing its genome to be associated with the helper for, I would say, at least 100 million years,” Erill says, which suggests there may be many more cases of this kind of relationship waiting to be discovered.</p>



<h4><strong>Contamination or discovery?</strong></h4>



<p>This groundbreaking discovery could easily have been missed. The project started out as a typical semester in the SEA-PHAGES program—an investigative curriculum where undergraduates isolate bacteriophages from environmental samples, send them out for sequencing, and then use bioinformatics tools to analyze the results. When the sequencing lab at the University of Pittsburgh reported contamination in the sample from UMBC expected to contain the MindFlayer phage, the journey began.</p>

He also conducts pedagogy research to improve science education. (Marlayna Demond ’11/UMBC)</figcaption></figure>



<p>The sample included one large sequence: the phage they expected. “But instead of just finding that, we also found a small sequence, which didn’t map to anything we knew,” says Erill, who is also one of the leads for<a href="https://umbc.edu/stories/phage-hunters-popular-umbc-research-program-opens-doors-to-biotech-careers/"> UMBC’s SEA-PHAGES program, called Phage Hunters</a>, along with<a href="https://biology.umbc.edu/directory/faculty/person/rm45122/"> <strong>Steven Caruso</strong></a>, principal lecturer of biological sciences. Caruso ’94, Ph.D. ’02, biological sciences, ran the isolation again, sent it out for sequencing—and got identical results.</p>



<p>That’s when the team pulled in deCarvalho to get a visual of what was going on with the transmission electron microscope (TEM) at UMBC’s<a href="https://kpif.umbc.edu/"> Keith R. Porter Imaging Facility</a> (KPIF). Without the images, the discovery would have been impossible.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Not everyone has a TEM at their disposal,” deCarvalho notes. But with the instruments at the KPIF, deCarvalho says, “I’m able to follow up on some of these observations and validate them with imaging. There’s elements of discovery we can only make using the TEM.”</p>



<p>The team’s discovery sets the stage for future work to figure out how the satellite attaches, how common this phenomenon is, and much more. “It’s possible that a lot of the bacteriophages that people thought were contaminated were actually these satellite-helper systems,” deCarvalho says. “So now, with this paper, people might be able to recognize more of these systems.”</p>

        The African Union also established the African Continental Free Trade Area, a free trade area spanning the whole continent with an estimated value of $3.4 trillion.

Large operations were carefully planned.  You wouldn't overlook the power requirements of a few racks being added -- there'd -- literally[0] -- be no place to plug them in without an electrician being brought in.  However, in a 3-month period every once in a while, two racks would have old devices replaced either due to failure or refresh, one at a time.</p><p>Since they weren't plugged directly into rack batteries (we had two battery rooms providing DC-wide battery backup), the overload wouldn't trip.  Since we were still below the capacity of the circuit, the breaker(s) wouldn't trip.  And maybe we're still under capacity for our backup system, but a few of the batteries are under-performing.</p><p>I think the lesson we learned when this happened was: you need to "actually test" the thing.  My understanding is that our tests were of the individual components in isolation.  We'd load test the batteries and the generator and then the relays between.  At the end of the day, though, if you don't cut the power and see what happens you don't truly know.  And my understanding is that having that final step in place resulted in a large number of additional tests being devised "of the individual components" that ensured they never had an outage like that, again.</p><p>[0] Guessing it's common practice to make "finding a f!cking power outlet" nearly impossible in DC.  Every rack had exactly the number of leads it needed for the hardware plugged into a completely full receptacle.  They rolled around a cart with a monitor, printer, label printer, keyboard, mouse and a huge UPS on it so staff could do daily maintenance work.

We had a diesel generator and a couple of (bathroom sized) rooms full of (what looked like) car batteries.  My understanding is that the two rooms were for redundancy.  The batteries could power the DC for hours but were used only until the generator was ready.<p>The area our DC was located in was impressively reliable power-wise and -- in fact -- the backup systems had managed through the multi-state power outage in the early 2000s without a hitch (short of nearly running out of fuel due to our fuel supplier being ... just a little overwhelmed).</p><p>A few years later a two minute power outage caused the DC to go dark for a full day.  Upon the power failing, the batteries kicked in and a few minutes after that the generator fired up and the DC went into holy terror.</p><p>About a minute after the generator kicked in, power to the DC blinked and ended.  The emergency lights kicked in, the evacuate alarm sounded[0] and panic ensued.</p><p>My very pedestrian understanding of the problem was that a few things failed -- when the generator kicked in, something didn't switch power correctly, then something else didn't trip in response to that, a set of 4 batteries caught fire (and destroyed several nearby).  They were extinguished by our facilities manager with a nearby fire extinguisher.  He, incidentally, was the one who pulled the alarm (which wouldn't, on its own, trigger the Halon system, I think).  The remainder of the day was spent dealing with the aftermath.</p><p>We were a global multi-national telecom with a mess of procedures in place for this sort of thing.  Everything was installed by electricians, to very exacting standards[1] but -- as with most things "backup" -- the way it was tested and the frequency of those tests was inadequate.</p><p>From that point forward (going on over a decade) they thoroughly tested the battery/generator backup once a quarter.</p><p>[0] We were warned to GTFO if that alarm goes off due to the flooding of chemicals that would follow a few minutes later.  That didn't happen.</p><p>[1] I remember the DC manager taking over in Cleveland making his staff work weeks of overtime replacing zip ties with wax lace (and it was done NASA style).  We're talking thousands and thousands of runs stretching two complete floors of a skyscraper.

Backup systems in those datacenters responded as designed, resulting in no loss of power or customer impact. At 7:24pm PDT, a large voltage spike was experienced by the electrical switching equipment in two of the US East-1 datacenters supporting a single Availability Zone. All utility electrical switches in both datacenters initiated transfer to generator power. In one of the datacenters, the transfer completed without incident. In the other, the generators started successfully, but each generator independently failed to provide stable voltage as they were brought into service. As a result, the generators did not pick up the load and servers operated without interruption during this period on the Uninterruptable Power Supply (“UPS”) units. Shortly thereafter, utility power was restored and our datacenter personnel transferred the datacenter back to utility power. The utility power in the Region failed a second time at 7:57pm PDT. Again, all rooms of this one facility failed to successfully transfer to generator power while all of our other datacenters in the Region continued to operate without customer impact.</p><p>&gt; The generators and electrical switching equipment in the datacenter that experienced the failure were all the same brand and all installed in late 2010 and early 2011. Prior to installation in this facility, the generators were rigorously tested by the manufacturer. At datacenter commissioning time, they again passed all load tests (approximately 8 hours of testing) without issue. On May 12th of this year, we conducted a full load test where the entire datacenter switched to and ran successfully on these same generators, and all systems operated correctly. The generators and electrical equipment in this datacenter are less than two years old, maintained by manufacturer representatives to manufacturer standards, and tested weekly. In addition, these generators operated flawlessly, once brought online Friday night, for just over 30 hours until utility power was restored to this datacenter. The equipment will be repaired, recertified by the manufacturer, and retested at full load onsite or it will be replaced entirely. In the interim, because the generators ran successfully for 30 hours after being manually brought online, we are confident they will perform properly if the load is transferred to them. Therefore, prior to completing the engineering work mentioned above, we will lengthen the amount of time the electrical switching equipment gives the generators to reach stable power before the switch board assesses whether the generators are ready to accept the full power load. Additionally, we will expand the power quality tolerances allowed when evaluating whether to switch the load to generator power. We will expand the size of the onsite 24x7 engineering staff to ensure that if there is a repeat event, the switch to generator will be completed manually (if necessary) before UPSs discharge and there is any customer impact.

This is the basis on which BGP announcements are typically filtered.</p><p>&gt; what is the alternative architecture that prevents IP address spoofing?</p><p>It is possible to extend the same filtering approaches used with BGP to actual traffic forwarding without making fundamental architectural changes.  See BCP38 (access) and BCP84 (peering).  Widespread adoption of these would eliminate IP spoofing.

Local company had a NOC and power went out in the area. They had moved into the build a long time ago and had two backup generators at the back end of the parking lot already installed. Power goes out, generator didn't start. 2nd generator started but it was now undersized and immediately tripped the breaker. First generator tried to start and it failed again.<p>Another local company had a backup generator in the basement. They were doing maintenance work on the power and messed up so the generator kicked in. Since it was in the basement, they had a belt to drive an exhaust fan. Generator kicked on, fan belt snapped, exhaust filled the entire basement, rolled into the service elevator, starts coming out the 3rd floor (top of the service elevator) and the building was then evacuated.</p><p>Last generator story, small IT shop with a small colo in the 2000s moved into a new building and got a natural gas generator installed with it running a self diagnostic once a month. Power goes out in the first month, lights go out, generator kicks on, lights come back, lights go back off. Turns out that the electrician didn't have a 60amp breaker that day and put in a 20 amp breaker for a 60+ amp generator. They meant to come back out and fix it and never did.

I remember one where they’d tested the generator but only for like a couple of minutes each month and so the fuel in the tank was really old by the time there was a real outage and the generator clogged expensively about an hour in, right as people were relaxing and thinking it’d be smooth sailing until the main power line was restored.

One example of the approach is the separate top-level domain usually used.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="MakeItRegularArticle-ArticleBody-5" data-module="ArticleBody" data-test="articleBody-1" data-analytics="MakeItRegularArticle-articleBody-5-1"><div><p>As workers reconsider their work-life balance post-pandemic, 92% of young people say that they would make sacrifices in exchange for a four-day workweek, <a href="https://www.bankrate.com/personal-finance/younger-workers-want-four-day-workweek/" target="_blank">according to a new Bankrate survey</a>.</p><p>"Younger generations have obviously lived through major economic events like the coronavirus pandemic, which blurred the lines between where you work, how you work, how much time you spend doing it," Sarah Foster, a Bankrate analyst, tells CNBC Make It. "That coupled with this still <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/03/the-job-market-is-strong-economists-say-but-workers-dont-think-so-.html">historically strong job market</a> … is giving them the leverage to bargain for what they want."</p><p>While the five-day schedule remains the standard in the U.S., 22% of U.S. workers anticipate that four-day workweeks will be the norm in their industry within the next five years. And the sacrifices that younger employees are willing to make might help change the tides.</p></div><h2><a id="headline0"></a>The concessions younger workers are willing to make</h2><div><p>Despite the popular belief that younger generations are champions of remote work, one-third of Gen Z and millennial workers say they'd be willing to work fully in-person if it meant shaving a day off of their workweek.</p><p>"If a company wants to bring younger workers back [into the office], maybe this is the perk they should look into," says Foster.</p><p>Other sacrifices that Gen Z and millennial employees say they'd make in exchange for a four-day workweek include working longer hours (48%), changing jobs or companies (35%), working weekends or evenings (27%) and even taking a pay cut (13%).&nbsp;</p><p>The Bankrate data is a sign that younger generations are prioritizing work-life balance and "recognizing that flexibility itself is a job perk," Foster says.&nbsp;</p><p>Older generations also show a strong interest in the four-day workweek, with over 86% of Gen X and baby boomer workers saying that they'd be willing to give something up in exchange for a shorter week.&nbsp;</p><p>There is one sacrifice that older workers are more inclined to make when compared with Gen Z and millennial workers: 61% say they would work longer hours to attain a four-day workweek.</p><p>But Gen Xers and baby boomers trail behind younger workers in other concessions they'd be willing to make, likely due to the fact that they've worked five-day schedules for most of their careers.&nbsp;</p><p>"Older generations, they've gotten in the habit of working these schedules, they know life before the coronavirus pandemic," says Foster. "There's something to be said about maybe not wanting to pursue that taste of flexibility the way that younger generations probably do."</p></div><h2><a id="headline1"></a>What will it take for four-day workweeks to become the norm?</h2><div><p>The 40-hour workweek has been commonplace <a href="https://www.dol.gov/general/aboutdol/history/flsa1938" target="_blank">since the Great Depression</a>, so it's hardly a surprise that employers remain resistant to change — in 2023, only <a href="https://www.adpri.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/People-at-Work-2023-A-Global-Workforce-View-1.pdf" target="_blank">15% of U.S. workers</a> say their employer offers a four-day workweek to promote positive mental health, according to payroll analysis company ADP.</p><p>While it would likely take government intervention to introduce widespread change, a rise in workers showing interest in companies that currently offer four-day workweeks could help drive a shift, Foster says.</p><p>"Once some companies start offering [four-day workweeks] and once many workers start to apply for those positions … it might actually end up putting more pressure on companies to introduce this non-traditional perk," she says.&nbsp;</p><p>While workers wanting a four-day workweek probably have the best luck looking for positions within companies that already offer it, employees pining for this perk within their employer should broach workweek conversations like they do pay negotiations, Foster says.&nbsp;</p><p>"It makes sense to think of the business case for switching to this schedule and the way it could help the bottom line of your company," she says. "Speaking your company's language could be the best step to secure more work-life balance, but it might end up being a baby step."</p><p>If you're going to initiate conversations around more flexible schedules, now might be the right time — Foster says workers should capitalize on the bargaining power they're seeing from the robust job market while it lasts.&nbsp;</p><p>"I would say that now is really the time to start looking into more flexible options and use this strong job market to your advantage while you can," she says.</p><p><em><strong>DON'T MISS: Want to be smarter and more successful with your money, work &amp; life?&nbsp;</strong></em><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/makeitnewsletter/"><em><strong>Sign up for our new newsletter!</strong></em></a></p><p><em>As technology reshapes business expectations, some leaders are embracing change and transforming their organizations for the future.

<p dir="auto">To run the model you need Python 3.7+</p>
<p dir="auto">If you don't have PyTorch installed. Follow their instructions <a href="https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Install the package <code>pix2tex</code>:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="pip install &quot;pix2tex[gui]&quot;"><pre><code>pip install "pix2tex[gui]"
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Model checkpoints will be downloaded automatically.</p>
<p dir="auto">There are three ways to get a prediction from an image.</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">You can use the command line tool by calling <code>pix2tex</code>. Here you can parse already existing images from the disk and images in your clipboard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/katie-lim">@katie-lim</a>, you can use a nice user interface as a quick way to get the model prediction. Just call the GUI with <code>latexocr</code>. From here you can take a screenshot and the predicted latex code is rendered using <a href="https://www.mathjax.org/" rel="nofollow">MathJax</a> and copied to your clipboard.</p>
<p dir="auto">Under linux, it is possible to use the GUI with <code>gnome-screenshot</code> (which comes with multiple monitor support) if <code>gnome-screenshot</code> was installed beforehand. For Wayland, <code>grim</code> and <code>slurp</code> will be used when they are both available. Note that <code>gnome-screenshot</code> is not compatible with wlroots-based Wayland compositors. Since <code>gnome-screenshot</code> will be preferred when available, you may have to set the environment variable <code>SCREENSHOT_TOOL</code> to <code>grim</code> in this case (other available values are <code>gnome-screenshot</code> and <code>pil</code>).</p>

<p dir="auto">The model works best with images of smaller resolution. That's why I added a preprocessing step where another neural network predicts the optimal resolution of the input image. This model will automatically resize the custom image to best resemble the training data and thus increase performance of images found in the wild. Still it's not perfect and might not be able to handle huge images optimally, so don't zoom in all the way before taking a picture.</p>
<p dir="auto">Always double check the result carefully. You can try to redo the prediction with an other resolution if the answer was wrong.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main"><article><header></header><p>I've used <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">a</a> <a href="https://gohugo.io/">lot</a>
<a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">of</a> <a href="https://www.getzola.org/">static</a>
<a href="https://nextjs.org/">site</a> <a href="https://astro.build/">generators</a> in the past and
they all have their own features and quirks, but most importantly you have to
architect your website to match what the framework expects.</p>
<p>Since yesterday this website is powered by my own SSG<sup><a href="#fn-1" id="fnref-1" data-footnote-ref="">1</a></sup>.
It's not meant to be reusable, it's just normal code—parsing and generating
files for this specific website.</p>
<p>And oh boy do I love it.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2>Why??</h2>
<p>When Vercel released <a href="https://nextjs.org/blog/next-14">Next.js 14</a> recently,
some friends I've talked to where still on Next.js 12 and really felt the
pressure to upgrade to not fall behind even more.
This made me think about the longevity and robustness of my website and so I
decided I don't want to depend on other people's decisions and run after version
upgrades I don't care about.</p>
<p>And even if your content is Markdown and media, almost everything around it
needs to be updated when switching frameworks—sometimes even when upgrading.
When I used Astro before, I wanted to statically generate OG images and, after
some research, managed to build it and even wrote
<a href="https://arne.me/articles/static-og-images-in-astro">an article</a> explaining how.
You loose all of this custom logic.</p>
<p>Plus, you get to choose your own stack.
Want to write your content in AsciiDoc? No-one can stop you!</p>
<p>I know what you're thinking and you're right, it's <em>way</em> more work than using
something that already exists.
But it's also so much more fun.
You can do anything with this, and you don't need to read documentation or try
to understand other people's architectural decisions—just start writing code!</p>
<h2>Okay, tell me how you did it</h2>
<p>After contemplating to build something dynamic<sup><a href="#fn-2" id="fnref-2" data-footnote-ref="">2</a></sup> for search without
JavaScript, I decided to stay with a static site.
It's faster and you don't have to worry about security or stability.
And of course I choose the best programming language on the planet, Rust (my
beloved).
Wait, come back, this is not a Rust post!</p>
<p>A static site generator mostly needs to do five things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Convert markdown to HTML</li>
<li>Render HTML templates</li>
<li>Compile CSS</li>
<li>Generate RSS feeds</li>
<li>Generate a sitemap</li>
</ol>
<p>And of these you might not even need the last three.
Surely your favourite programming language has a Markdown parser and a
templating engine.</p>
<p>For Rust I chose these crates<sup><a href="#fn-3" id="fnref-3" data-footnote-ref="">3</a></sup>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://crates.io/crates/comrak">comrak</a> and <a href="https://crates.io/crates/gray_matter">gray_matter</a> for parsing Markdown and the frontmatter</li>
<li><a href="https://maud.lambda.xyz/">maud</a> for compile-time templates</li>
<li><a href="https://crates.io/crates/grass">grass</a> for SCSS compilation</li>
<li><a href="https://crates.io/crates/rss">rss</a> for (you guessed it) generating RSS feeds</li>
<li><a href="https://crates.io/crates/quick-xml">quick-xml</a> for generating the sitemap</li>
</ul>
<p>Once I got the tools I needed, I just started writing software.
I built something to parse my content, something to render all the different
templates I needed, something to generate the RSS, something to generate a
sitemap and…that's it, really!</p>
<p>And when it's time to add OG images to this website, I can choose the best
libraries and just build it.</p>
<h2>What now?</h2>
<p>I hope this article left you either validated that rolling your own not worth it
and you want to keep using a framework or interested to see what's on the other
side.</p>
<p>If you're in the latter camp, you can check out the
<a href="https://github.com/bahlo/arne.me">source of this website</a> to get some
inspiration.
But most importantly: Choose a tech stack that excites you and have fun!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 id="Summary">Summary</h2>

This will allow stream pipelines to transform data in ways that are not easily achievable with the existing built-in intermediate operations. This is a <a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/12">preview API</a>.</p>
<h2 id="Goals">Goals</h2>

<p>Make stream pipelines more flexible and expressive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Insofar as possible, allow custom intermediate operations to manipulate streams of infinite size.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Non-Goals">Non-Goals</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It is not a goal to change the Java programming language to better facilitate stream processing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is not a goal to special-case the compilation of code that uses the Stream&nbsp;API.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>Java 8 introduced the first API designed specifically for lambda expressions: the Stream API, <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/util/stream/package-summary.html"><code>java.util.stream</code></a>. A stream is a lazily computed, potentially unbounded sequence of values. The API supports the ability to process a stream either sequentially or in parallel.</p>
<p>A <em>stream pipeline</em> consists of three parts: a source of elements, any number of intermediate operations, and a terminal operation. For example:</p>
<pre><code>long numberOfWords =
    Stream.of("the", "", "fox", "jumps", "over", "the", "", "dog")  // (1)
          .filter(Predicate.not(String::isEmpty))                   // (2)
          .collect(Collectors.counting());                          // (3)</code></pre>
<p>This programming style is both expressive and efficient. With the builder-style API, each intermediate operation returns a new stream; evaluation begins only when a terminal operation is invoked. In this example, line (1) creates a stream, but does not evaluate it, line (2) sets up an intermediate <code>filter</code> operation but still does not evaluate the stream, and finally the terminal <code>collect</code> operation on line (3) evaluates the entire stream pipeline.</p>
<p>The Stream API provides a reasonably rich, albeit fixed, set of intermediate and terminal operations: mapping, filtering, reduction, sorting, and so forth. It also includes an extensible terminal operation, <code>Stream::collect</code>, which enables the output of a pipeline to be summarized in a variety of ways.</p>
<p>The use of streams in the Java ecosystem is by now pervasive, and ideal for many tasks, but the fixed set of intermediate operations means that some complex tasks cannot easily be expressed as stream pipelines. Either a required intermediate operation does not exist, or it exists but does not directly support the task.</p>
<p>As an example, suppose the task is to take a stream of strings and make it distinct, but with distinctness based on string length rather than content. That is, at most one string of length 1 should be emitted, and at most one string of length 2, and at most one string of length 3, and so forth. Ideally, the code would look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>var result = Stream.of("foo", "bar", "baz", "quux")
                   .distinctBy(String::length)      // Hypothetical
                   .toList();

// result ==&gt; [foo, quux]</code></pre>
<p>Unfortunately, <code>distinctBy</code> is not a built-in intermediate operation. The closest built-in operation, <code>distinct</code>, tracks the elements it has already seen by using object equality to compare them. That is, <code>distinct</code> is stateful but in this case uses the wrong state: We want it to track elements based on equality of string length, not string content. We could work around this limitation by declaring a class that defines object equality in terms of string length, wrapping each string in an instance of that class and applying <code>distinct</code> to those instances. This expression of the task is not intuitive, however, and makes for code that is difficult to maintain:</p>
<pre><code>record DistinctByLength(String str) {

    @Override public boolean equals(Object obj) {
        return obj instanceof DistinctByLength(String other)
               &amp;&amp; str.length() == other.length();
    }

    @Override public int hashCode() {
        return str == null ? 0 : Integer.hashCode(str.length());
    }

}

var result = Stream.of("foo", "bar", "baz", "quux")
                   .map(DistinctByLength::new)
                   .distinct()
                   .map(DistinctByLength::str)
                   .toList();

// result ==&gt; [foo, quux]</code></pre>
<p>As another example, suppose the task is to group elements into fixed-size groups of three, but retain only the first two groups: <code>[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ...]</code> should produce <code>[[0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5]]</code>. Ideally, the code would look like this:</p>
<pre><code>var result = Stream.iterate(0, i -&gt; i + 1)
                   .windowFixed(3)                  // Hypothetical
                   .limit(2)
                   .toList();

// result ==&gt; [[0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5]]</code></pre>
<p>Unfortunately, no built-in intermediate operation supports this task. The best option is to place the fixed-window grouping logic in the terminal operation, by invoking <code>collect</code> with a custom <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/util/stream/Collector.html"><code>Collector</code></a>. However, we must precede the <code>collect</code> operation with a fixed-size <code>limit</code> operation, since the collector cannot signal to <code>collect</code> that it is finished while new elements are appearing — which happens forever with an infinite stream. Also, the task is inherently about ordered data, so it is not feasible to have the collector perform grouping in parallel, and it must signal this fact by throwing an exception if its combiner is invoked. The resulting code is difficult to understand:</p>
<pre><code>var result

<p>Over the years, many new intermediate operations have been suggested for the Stream API. Most of them make sense when considered in isolation, but adding all of them would make the (already large) Stream API more difficult to learn because its operations would be less discoverable.</p>
<p>The designers of the Stream API understood that it would be desirable to have an <a href="https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8132369">extension point</a> so that anyone could define intermediate stream operations. At the time, however, they did not know what that extension point should look like. It eventually became clear that the extension point for terminal operations, namely <code>Stream::collect(Collector)</code>, was effective. We can now take a similar approach for intermediate operations.</p>
<p>In summary, more intermediate operations create more situational value, making streams a better fit for even more tasks. We should provide an API for custom intermediate operations that allows developers to transform finite and infinite streams in their preferred ways.</p>
<h2 id="Description">Description</h2>
<p><a href="https://cr.openjdk.org/~vklang/gatherers/api/java.base/java/util/stream/Gatherer.html"><code>Stream::gather(Gatherer)</code></a> is a new intermediate stream operation that processes the elements of a stream by applying a user-defined entity called a <em>gatherer</em>. With the <code>gather</code> operation we can build efficient, parallel-ready streams that implement almost any intermediate operation.  <code>Stream::gather(Gatherer)</code> is to intermediate operations what <code>Stream::collect(Collector)</code> is to terminal operations.</p>
<p>A <em>gatherer</em> represents a transform of the elements of a stream; it is an instance of the <a href="https://cr.openjdk.org/~vklang/gatherers/api/java.base/java/util/stream/Gatherer.html"><code>java.util.stream.Gatherer</code></a> interface. Gatherers can transform elements in a one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one, or many-to-many fashion. They can track previously seen elements in order to influence the transformation of later elements, they can short-circuit in order to transform infinite streams to finite ones, and they can enable parallel execution. For example, a gatherer can transform one input element to one output element until some condition becomes true, at which time it starts to transform one input element to two output elements.</p>
<p>A gatherer is defined by four functions that work together:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The optional <em>initializer</em> function provides an object that maintains private state while processing stream elements. For example, a gatherer can store the current element so that, the next time it is applied, it can compare the new element with the now-previous element and, say, emit only the larger of the two. In effect, such a gatherer transforms two input elements into one output element.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <em>integrator</em> function integrates a new element from the input stream, possibly inspecting the private state object and possibly emitting elements to the output stream. It can also terminate processing before reaching the end of the input stream; for example, a gatherer searching for the largest of a stream of integers can terminate if it detects <code>Integer.MAX_VALUE</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The optional <em>combiner</em> function can be used to evaluate the gatherer in parallel when the input stream is marked as parallel. If a gatherer is not parallel-capable then it can still be part of a parallel stream pipeline, but it is evaluated sequentially. This is useful for cases where an operation is inherently ordered in nature and thus cannot be parallelized.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The optional <em>finisher</em> function is invoked when there are no more input elements to consume. This function can inspect the private state object and, possibly, emit additional output elements. For example, a gatherer searching for a specific element amongst its input elements can report failure, say by throwing an exception, when its finisher is invoked.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When invoked, <code>Stream::gather</code> performs the equivalent of the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Create a <a href="https://cr.openjdk.org/~vklang/gatherers/api/java.base/java/util/stream/Gatherer.Downstream.html"><code>Downstream</code></a> object which, when given an element of the gatherer’s output type, passes it to the next stage in the pipeline.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Obtain the gatherer’s private state object by invoking the <code>get()</code> method of its <a href="https://cr.openjdk.org/~vklang/gatherers/api/java.base/java/util/stream/Gatherer.html#initializer()">initializer</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Obtain the gatherer’s <a href="https://cr.openjdk.org/~vklang/gatherers/api/java.base/java/util/stream/Gatherer.Integrator.html">integrator</a> by invoking its <a href="https://cr.openjdk.org/~vklang/gatherers/api/java.base/java/util/stream/Gatherer.html#integrator()"><code>integrator()</code></a> method.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While there are more input elements, invoke the integrator's <a href="https://cr.openjdk.org/~vklang/gatherers/api/java.base/java/util/stream/Gatherer.Integrator.html#integrate(A,T,java.util.stream.Gatherer.Downstream)">integrate(...)</a> method, passing it the state object, the next element, and the downstream object. Terminate if that method returns <code>false</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Obtain the gatherer’s <a href="https://cr.openjdk.org/~vklang/gatherers/api/java.base/java/util/stream/Gatherer.html#finisher()">finisher</a> and invoke it with the state and downstream objects.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Every existing intermediate operation declared in the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/util/stream/Stream.html"><code>Stream</code></a> interface can be implemented by invoking <code>gather</code> with a gatherer that implements that operation. For example, given a stream of <code>T</code>-typed elements, <code>Stream::map</code> turns each <code>T</code> element into a <code>U</code> element by applying a function and then passes the <code>U</code> element downstream; this is simply a stateless one-to-one gatherer. As another example, <code>Stream::filter</code> takes a predicate that determines whether an input element should be passed downstream; this is simply a stateless one-to-many gatherer. In fact every stream pipeline is, conceptually, equivalent to</p>
<pre><code>source.gather(...).gather(...).gather(...).collect(...)</code></pre>
<h3 id="Built-in-gatherers">Built-in gatherers</h3>
<p>We introduce the following built-in gatherers in the <a href="https://cr.openjdk.org/~vklang/gatherers/api/java.base/java/util/stream/Gatherers.html">java.util.stream.Gatherers</a> class:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://cr.openjdk.org/~vklang/gatherers/api/java.base/java/util/stream/Gatherers.html#fold(java.util.function.Supplier,java.util.function.BiFunction)"><code>fold</code></a> is a stateful many-to-one gatherer which constructs an aggregate incrementally and emits that aggregate when no more input elements exist.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://cr.openjdk.org/~vklang/gatherers/api/java.base/java/util/stream/Gatherers.html#mapConcurrent(int,java.util.function.Function)"><code>mapConcurrent</code></a> is a stateful one-to-one gatherer which invokes a supplied function for each input element concurrently, up to a supplied limit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://cr.openjdk.org/~vklang/gatherers/api/java.base/java/util/stream/Gatherers.html#scan(java.util.function.Supplier,java.util.function.BiFunction)"><code>scan</code></a> is a stateful one-to-one gatherer which applies a supplied function to the current state and the current element to produce the next element, which it passes downstream.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://cr.openjdk.org/~vklang/gatherers/api/java.base/java/util/stream/Gatherers.html#windowFixed(int)"><code>windowFixed</code></a> is a stateful many-to-many gatherer which groups input elements into lists of a supplied size, emitting the windows downstream when they are full.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://cr.openjdk.org/~vklang/gatherers/api/java.base/java/util/stream/Gatherers.html#windowSliding(int)"><code>windowSliding</code></a> is a stateful many-to-many gatherer which groups input elements into lists of a supplied size. After the first window, each subsequent window is created from a copy of its predecessor by dropping the first element and appending the next element from the input stream..</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Parallel-evaluation">Parallel evaluation</h3>
<p>Parallel evaluation of a gatherer is split into two distinct modes. When a combiner is not provided, the stream library can still extract parallelism by executing upstream and downstream operations in parallel, analogous to a short-circuitable <code>parallel().forEachOrdered()</code> operation. When a combiner is provided, parallel evaluation is analogous to a short-circuitable <code>parallel().reduce()</code> operation.</p>
<h3 id="Composing-gatherers">Composing gatherers</h3>
<p>Gatherers support composition via the <a href="https://cr.openjdk.org/~vklang/gatherers/api/java.base/java/util/stream/Gatherer.html#andThen(java.util.stream.Gatherer)"><code>andThen(Gatherer)</code></a> method, which joins two gatherers where the first produces elements that the second can consume.  This enables the creation of sophisticated gatherers by composing simpler ones, just like <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/util/function/Function.html#andThen(java.util.function.Function)">function composition</a>.  Semantically,</p>
<pre><code>source.gather(a).gather(b).gather(c).collect(...)</code></pre>
<p>is equivalent to</p>
<pre><code>source.gather(a.andThen(b).andThen(c)).collect(...)</code></pre>
<h3 id="Gatherers-vs--collectors">Gatherers vs. collectors</h3>
<p>The design of the <code>Gatherer</code> interface is heavily influenced by the design of <code>Collector</code>. The main differences are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>Gatherer</code> uses an <a href="https://cr.openjdk.org/~vklang/gatherers/api/java.base/java/util/stream/Gatherer.Integrator.html"><code>Integrator</code></a> instead of a <a href="https://cr.openjdk.org/~vklang/gatherers/api/java.base/java/util/function/BiConsumer.html"><code>BiConsumer</code></a> for per-element processing because it needs an extra input parameter for the <a href="https://cr.openjdk.org/~vklang/gatherers/api/java.base/java/util/stream/Gatherer.Downstream.html"><code>Downstream</code></a> object, and because it needs to return a <code>boolean</code> to indicate whether processing should continue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Gatherer</code> uses a <a href="https://cr.openjdk.org/~vklang/gatherers/api/java.base/java/util/function/BiConsumer.html"><code>BiConsumer</code></a> for its finisher instead of a <a href="https://cr.openjdk.org/~vklang/gatherers/api/java.base/java/util/function/Function.html"><code>Function</code></a> because it needs an extra input parameter for its <a href="https://cr.openjdk.org/~vklang/gatherers/api/java.base/java/util/stream/Gatherer.Downstream.html"><code>Downstream</code></a> object, and because it cannot return a result and thus is <code>void</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Example:-Embracing-the-stream">Example: Embracing the stream</h3>
<p>Sometimes the lack of an appropriate intermediate operation forces us to evaluate a stream into a list and run our analysis logic in a loop. Suppose, for example, that we have a stream of temporally ordered temperature readings:</p>
<pre><code>record Reading(Instant obtainedAt, int degreesK) {

    Reading(String time, int degreesK) {
        this(Instant.parse(time), degreesK);
    }

    static Stream&lt;Reading&gt; loadRecentReadings() {
        // In reality these could be read from a file, a database,
        // a service, or otherwise
        return Stream.of(
                new Reading("2023-09-21T10:15:30.00Z", 310),
                new Reading("2023-09-21T10:15:31.00Z", 312),
                new Reading("2023-09-21T10:15:32.00Z", 350),
                new Reading("2023-09-21T10:15:33.00Z", 310)
        );
    }

}</code></pre>
<p>Suppose, further, that we want to detect suspicious changes in this stream, defined as temperature changes of more than 30° Kelvin across two consecutive readings within a five-second window of time:</p>
<pre><code>boolean isSuspicious(Reading previous, Reading next) {
    return next.obtainedAt().isBefore(previous.obtainedAt().plusSeconds(5))
           &amp;&amp; (next.degreesK() &gt; previous.degreesK() + 30
               || next.degreesK() &lt; previous.degreesK() - 30);
}</code></pre>
<p>This requires a sequential scan of the input stream, so we must eschew declarative stream processing and implement our analysis imperatively:</p>
<pre><code>List&lt;List&lt;Reading&gt;&gt; findSuspicious(Stream&lt;Reading&gt; source) {
    var suspicious = new ArrayList&lt;List&lt;Reading&gt;&gt;();
    Reading previous = null;
    boolean hasPrevious = false;
    for (Reading next : source.toList()) {
        if (!hasPrevious) {
            hasPrevious = true;
            previous = next;
        } else {
            if (isSuspicious(previous, next))
                suspicious.add(List.of(previous, next));
            previous = next;
        }
    }
    return suspicious;
}

var result = findSuspicious(Reading.loadRecentReadings());

// result ==&gt; [[Reading[obtainedAt=2023-09-21T10:15:31Z, degreesK=312],
//              Reading[obtainedAt=2023-09-21T10:15:32Z, degreesK=350]],
//             [Reading[obtainedAt=2023-09-21T10:15:32Z, degreesK=350],
//              Reading[obtainedAt=2023-09-21T10:15:33Z, degreesK=310]]]</code></pre>
<p>With a gatherer, however, we can express this more succinctly:</p>
<pre><code>List&lt;List&lt;Reading&gt;&gt; findSuspicious(Stream&lt;Reading&gt; source) {
    return source.gather(Gatherers.windowSliding(2))
                 .filter(window -&gt; (window.size() == 2
                                    &amp;&amp; isSuspicious(window.get(0),
                                                    window.get(1))))
                 .toList();
}</code></pre>

<h2 id="Alternatives">Alternatives</h2>
<p>We explored alternatives in a <a href="https://cr.openjdk.org/~vklang/Gatherers.html">separate design document</a>.</p>
<h2 id="Risks-and-Assumptions">Risks and Assumptions</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The use of custom gatherers, and of the built-in gatherers declared in the <code>Gatherers</code> class, will not be as succinct as the use of the built-in intermediate operations declared in the <code>Stream</code> class. The definition of custom gatherers will, however, be similar in complexity to the definition of custom collectors for terminal <code>collect</code> operations.  The use of both custom and built-in gatherers will, moreover, be similar in complexity to the use of custom collectors and the built-in collectors declared in the <code>Collectors</code> class.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We might revise the set of built-in gatherers over the course of previewing this feature, and we might revise the set of built-in gatherers in future releases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We will not add a new intermediate operation to the <code>Stream</code> class for each of the built-in gatherers defined in the <code>Gatherers</code> class, even though for the sake of uniformity it is tempting to do so. In order to preserve the learnability of the <code>Stream</code> class we will consider adding new intermediate operations to it only after experience suggests that they are broadly useful. We might add such methods in a later round of preview, or even after this feature is final. Exposing new built-in gatherers now does not preclude adding dedicated <code>Stream</code> methods later.</p>
