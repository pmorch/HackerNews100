            <span>Abstract:</span>As Large Language Models become more ubiquitous across domains, it becomes important to examine their inherent limitations critically. This work argues that hallucinations in language models are not just occasional errors but an inevitable feature of these systems. We demonstrate that hallucinations stem from the fundamental mathematical and logical structure of LLMs. It is, therefore, impossible to eliminate them through architectural improvements, dataset enhancements, or fact-checking mechanisms. Our analysis draws on computational theory and Godel's First Incompleteness Theorem, which references the undecidability of problems like the Halting, Emptiness, and Acceptance Problems. We demonstrate that every stage of the LLM process-from training data compilation to fact retrieval, intent classification, and text generation-will have a non-zero probability of producing hallucinations. This work introduces the concept of Structural Hallucination as an intrinsic nature of these systems. By establishing the mathematical certainty of hallucinations, we challenge the prevailing notion that they can be fully mitigated.

<p>Here’s a puzzle: how do you create a trillion-dollar debt bubble that can’t be popped? Answer: make student loans non-dischargeable in bankruptcy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, here’s a trickier one: how do you fix this mess when the solution threatens a multibillion-dollar industry?</p>



<p>This isn’t just a theoretical exercise.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s the reality we’re living in.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The U.S. student loan system is a perfect storm of misaligned incentives, regulatory capture, and unintended consequences.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The solutions are surprisingly straightforward – make loans dischargeable, tie lending to degree value, hold institutions accountable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But implementing them?&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s where things get complicated.</p>



<p>You see, there’s a reason this broken system persists.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s not just inertia or incompetence.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s because there are powerful, entrenched interests that profit handsomely from the status quo. They cloak themselves in the noble rhetoric of education, but their actions tell a different story: skyrocketing tuition, subpar outcomes, and a generation drowning in debt.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s not about enlightenment; it’s about enrichment – theirs, not yours.</p>



<h2><strong>The Numbers Don’t Lie</strong></h2>



<p>The results were predictable, if you knew where to look. In 2003, total student loan debt was around $250 billion. Today? It’s over $1.7 trillion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s not growth; that’s an explosion.</p>



<p>But here’s the real kicker: this debt isn’t just a personal burden. It’s propping up a deeply flawed system.</p>



<p>The results are insidious:</p>



<ol>
<li>Millions of Americans graduate from college overloaded with debt and underprepared for the job market.</li>



<li>The institutions that create these outcomes are not held to account because market forces are not at play.</li>



<li>Colleges have no incentive to control costs or improve outcomes, as they get paid regardless.</li>



<li>Lenders keep issuing loans without regard for the borrower’s ability to repay, knowing the debt can’t be discharged.</li>
</ol>



<p>In essence, the non-dischargeability of student loans has created a perfect storm of misaligned incentives. It’s a system that rewards failure and punishes success.</p>



<p>Consider these facts:</p>



<ol>
<li>Only 41% of college students graduate within 4 years, yet colleges face no consequences for low completion rates.[1]</li>



<li>The average student loan debt for the Class of 2023 is $37,574, but 43% of recent graduates are underemployed in their first job.[2][3]</li>



<li>Despite skyrocketing tuition, only 60% of college graduates feel their education was worth the cost.[4]</li>



<li>From 1980 to 2020, the cost of college tuition increased by 180%, while the quality of education and job market preparation have not seen comparable improvements.[5]</li>
</ol>



<p>These aren’t just numbers. They’re evidence of a system that’s fundamentally broken.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfOz-9DG9LvxMEqXqHmGTCsEhonOK_BQWTrPf41afmZbcPinA4KMPUwKlRfjfmNvlMGnvBPRgHn9TIbVtAs1ZvDVl4-Np8snYDQE8DQwaAonngxfMWYOKa3uvdzicvdTWIjCM5yvPPFJxBjic5eikY3Tug?key=qESaRlsuKOM2zDmKb9y0kA" alt=""></figure>



<h2><strong>The Institutional Shield</strong></h2>



<p>But why don’t market forces correct these issues?&nbsp;</p>



<p>The answer lies in the unique shield that non-dischargeable student loans provide to educational institutions and lenders.</p>



<p>In a normal market, if a product consistently fails to deliver value, consumers stop buying it. Producers either improve or go out of business. But in the world of higher education, this feedback loop is broken.</p>



<p>Colleges and universities, shielded by the guarantee of student loan money, have no real incentive to improve their product or direct students to majors that have an ability to pay back their loans.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They can raise tuition year after year, even as the value of their degrees stagnates or declines.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They can offer degrees with poor job prospects knowing that students will still come—and still be able to borrow.</p>



<p>This data by the NY Fed highlights the majors with the worst underemployment, i.e. graduates working in jobs that don’t require a degree. Criminal justice, performing arts and art history have an over 60%+ underemployment rate with performing arts and art history majors being upsold into graduate school piling on even more debt.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdG3HoIJ7O7GAdPDahR5iqW2zaOMLHqpxbodYIn_mIG5rXBHgnP9J4hm94d-DsH-vpsd1WQ48kHSVqOAP5YmZ9fX-dCpJP55rSk7qHwvxoreYKHEG6hDp_zDckUStgSGGbbvlvAINyaMZn_0WhHaeduAke9?key=qESaRlsuKOM2zDmKb9y0kA" alt=""></figure>



<p>Meanwhile, lenders—both government and private—keep the money flowing. Why wouldn’t they? With loans that can’t be discharged in bankruptcy, they’re guaranteed a return, even if it takes decades to collect.</p>



<p>This perverse system means that the very institutions that should be preparing students for success are instead setting them up for a lifetime of debt. And they’re doing it with impunity.</p>



<h2><strong>But Wait, There’s More!</strong></h2>



<p>In a twist that would be comical if it weren’t so cruel, these loans can follow borrowers into retirement, threatening the very safety net meant to protect them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yes, you read that right.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The federal government can and does garnish Social Security benefits to repay defaulted federal student loans.[6] Up to 15% of a person’s Social Security check can be seized, though the government must leave the borrower with at least $750 a month.</p>



<p>Let that sink in for a moment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The system is so ruthless in its pursuit of repayment that it’s willing to take money from retirees’ already modest Social Security checks.</p>



<p>&nbsp;It’s a stark reminder that in the world of student loans, there’s no such thing as a fresh start.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Not even in your golden years.</p>



<p>Consider these sobering facts:</p>



<ol>
<li>As of 2015, 114,000 older Americans had their Social Security benefits garnished due to defaulted student loans.[7]</li>



<li>The number of Americans aged 60 and older with student loan debt quadrupled from 2005 to 2015.[8]</li>



<li>Nearly 40% of federal student loan borrowers aged 65 and older are in default.[9]</li>
</ol>



<p>This isn’t just a young person’s problem anymore. It’s a crisis that spans generations, threatening the financial security of Americans from cradle to grave.</p>



<h2><strong>The Birth of a Monster</strong></h2>



<p>The road to hell is paved with good intentions, and the student loan crisis is no exception.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It started innocently enough in 1976 with the Education Amendments. The goal? Prevent students from gaming the system by declaring bankruptcy right after graduation. Seems reasonable, right?</p>



<p>But then came the creep.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Five years of non-dischargeability became seven.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Then, in 1998, it became forever.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The final nail in the coffin was the 2005 Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act, which extended this rule to private student loans.</p>



<p>Suddenly, lenders had a captive market.&nbsp;</p>



<p>No matter how bad things got, borrowers couldn’t escape.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It was a lender’s dream and a borrower’s nightmare.</p>



<h2><strong>The Unseen Victims</strong></h2>



<p>But the damage goes beyond the obvious. Student loan debt is a silent killer of American competitiveness and risk-taking.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The reality is we’re churning out millions of graduates with no discernible skills drowning in debt. 4 in 10 per the NY Fed are underemployed working in retail or as baristas making zero use of their criminal justice degrees.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXf3cmaCqjrs66G92OSDcY_X9Y_pKrRjN5ZmAxc6vy4aA-06gqKuwB2mFWjKXt1zfEFt6IN7xOFqipb29CsDnYF36-uDr0lujRv1NE3C3fI0f9MndyOexPsUszXVP1l7HAt7y2R_bbsM7nmIhnEvjlzjS07_?key=qESaRlsuKOM2zDmKb9y0kA" alt=""></figure>



<p>Smart graduates laden with debt also can’t afford to take risks. <a href="https://anandsanwal.me/school-of-entrepreneurs/">They can’t start businesses</a>. They can’t buy homes. They can’t invest in their futures. They’re too busy paying for their past.</p>



<p>And it’s not just individuals who suffer. The entire economy takes a hit. When a significant portion of the population is funneling its income into loan payments rather than spending or investing, it’s a drag on everyone – even those who never set foot in a college classroom.</p>



<h2><strong>The Entrenched Powers</strong></h2>



<p>Now, you might be thinking: “This is clearly broken. Why hasn’t it been fixed?”</p>



<p>The answer is as old as politics itself: follow the money.</p>



<p>The student loan system has created a powerful alliance of interests:</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>Colleges and Universities</strong>: They get guaranteed money, regardless of the quality of education they provide.</li>



<li><strong>Lenders</strong>: They get guaranteed returns, backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.</li>



<li><strong>Politicians</strong>: They get donations from the first two groups, ensuring the status quo remains intact.</li>
</ol>



<p>This unholy trinity has no incentive to change the system. In fact, they have every reason to keep it exactly as it is.</p>



<h2><strong>The Way Out</strong></h2>



<p>So, what’s the solution? It’s simple, but not easy:</p>



<ol>
<li>Make student loans dischargeable in bankruptcy again.</li>



<li>Tie lending terms to the value of the degree.</li>



<li>Impose risk-sharing requirements on educational institutions – Schools would face financial penalties or need to contribute to a risk-sharing pool if their graduates default at high rates.</li>
</ol>



<p>But here’s the rub: implementing these changes would cause a massive shake-up.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Colleges would have to rethink their entire financial models. They’d have to rethink the majors they offer, <a href="https://anandsanwal.me/harvard-luxury-birkin-bag-education/">their tuition fees</a> and have to dramatically reduce their administrative bloat.</p>



<p>Lenders would face actual risk. Politicians would lose a reliable source of campaign contributions.</p>



<p>In other words, the very people who have the power to fix the system are the ones who benefit from keeping it broken.</p>



<h2><strong>The Fork in the Road</strong></h2>



<p>We’re at a crossroads.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We can continue down this path, creating a permanent debtor class and stifling economic growth. Or we can make the hard choices necessary to create a sustainable, equitable system of higher education.</p>



<p>The choice is ours.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But make no mistake: the clock is ticking.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Every day we delay, another student signs on the dotted line, committing to a lifetime of debt they will likely never escape.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p><time datetime="2024-09-12">Sep 12, 2024</time>
(<a href="https://10maurycy10.github.io/tags/electronics">Electronics</a>)</p><p>Most speakers emit sound in all directions because they are relatively small compared to the wavelength.
Audible sounds have wavelengths of up to several meters, so an acoustically “large” speaker might not even fit in your house.</p><p>Fortunately, strong modulated ultrasound <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_acoustics">is slowly converted</a> to normal sound as it passes through the air.
Ultrasound wavelengths are typically around a centimeter allowing a compact directional speaker.</p><p>Ordinary coil-and-magnet speakers don’t work well at the ultrasound range, so I had to use specialized piezoelectric transducers.
These are quite small, mine had a diameter of just one centimeter:</p><p><img src="https://10maurycy10.github.io/projects/speaker/trans.jpg" alt="A photograph showing a small transducer in a metal can"></p><p>These transducers only work in a narrow range of frequencies, mine are designed for 40 kHz.
With the 8 mm wavelength, they are large enough for some directionality, but not nearly enough for the “sound laser” effect I wanted.</p><p>As a work around, I wired multiple transducers together in parallel to act as one very large transducer.
My circuit board has room for 73 transducers, arranged in a 18 cm by 6 cm rectangle:</p><p><img src="https://10maurycy10.github.io/projects/speaker/array.jpg" alt="A photograph of a large array of transducers"></p><p>This array is 20 wavelengths by 7 wavelengths, large enough to create quite a narrow beam.</p><p><a href="https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/cui-devices/CUSA-TR80-15-2000-TH/13687405">My transducers</a> had their polarity marked on the bottom, but on other models markings are often missing or misleading.
To test the polarity, hook up the transducer to an oscilloscope and lightly poke the ceramic disk inside.
This should create 2 opposite pulses, one from applying pressure and the other from releasing it.
The polarity of the first pulse must be the same way around for the whole array.
Otherwise, half the transducers will be pulling air while the others are pushing it, resulting in no overall sound.</p><p>I would highly recommend testing a random sample before doing any soldering.</p><p>These transducers can’t be driven from a regular audio amplifier, because they have very different requirements then normal speakers.
They are sensitive to <em>charge</em>, and need both high voltage and high current, unlike speakers which need some current but minimal voltage.</p><p>This is the circuit I designed to both generate the needed modulated ultrasound and drive the transducers:</p><p><img src="https://10maurycy10.github.io/projects/speaker/driver_sch.png" alt="A schematic diagram of the driver"></p><p>It uses a 555 timer to create a 40 kHz carrier, which the op-amp pulse-width modulates with audio input.
Pulse width modulation is equivalent to amplitude modulation, but can be amplified without needing to preserve analog voltage levels:</p><p><img src="https://10maurycy10.github.io/projects/speaker/pwm.png" alt="A scope trace showing pulse width modulation"></p><p>Once modulated, the signal goes into a class B/push-pull amplifier, which drives the final stage, a MOSFET H-bridge.
I don’t remember exactly what transistors I grabbed, but just about any enhancement mode power MOSFETs should work.</p><p>The final component is a loading coil, which resonates with the capacitance of the transducer making it much easier to drive.
The transducer’s capacitance varies by an order of magnitude between different frequencies, so unless you have a LCR meter, its best to experimentally find the value that produces the highest AC voltage across the array.</p><p>Use the physically largest inductor you can, those will have the lowest resistance and will have lower losses to core saturation.</p><p>The maximum supply voltage is limited to 30 volts by the regulator, but that starts getting close to the transducer’s maximum voltage, so it’s not much of a loss.
Thirty volts is reasonably loud, quite competitive with a regular speaker.</p><p>Here’s the prototype driver built up on a perfboard:</p><p><img src="https://10maurycy10.github.io/projects/speaker/driver.jpg" alt="A photograph of the assembled driver"></p><p>The result of all this is a beam of sound only a few degrees wide, just like a laser.
You can hear sound, take a step to the side and it completely disappears:</p><iframe width="600" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YzRGDPET4Sw?si=k0ZCcU5Jo78Oe4n8" title="Video" frameborder="0" allow="encrypted-media; picture-in-picture;" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><blockquote><p>Music from <a href="http://audionautix.com/">audionautix</a>.
The popping is an artifact from the microphone and is not audable in real life.</p></blockquote><p>The beam also bounces off objects, making it seam like the sound is coming from somewhere else.
Strangely, the sound is actually louder when bouncing off a hard object like a wall then when listening to it directly.
I’m guessing that the surface creates areas of higher ultrasound intensity, creating more sound then would be created otherwise.</p><p>It works quite well for rickrolling, especially if the sound is bounced of a wall to make it harder to track down.
This is my only pranking device that has everyone asking how it works.</p><p>On the other hand, it’s not really a good speaker.
It has virtually no bass response, tends to distort louder audio, and is not all that loud.</p><p>It also does strange things to microphones, playing a low frequency (10-200 Hz) sound will completely ruin recordings, even when not directly pointed at the microphone.
This depends on the ultrasound directly hitting the microphone, so can be stopped with those fuzzy wind covers.</p><h2 id="just-why-does-this-work">Just why does this work?</h2><p>It’s not immediately intuitive why a speaker being larger makes it more directional.
Imagine the sound waves coming from two points on the edges of the speaker.</p><p>If you’re directly in front of it, the distances the sound has to take are identical, and the waves add up, creating a loud sound.
However, if you’re to the side, the distances will be different, and one of the waves will be shifted, canceling out the other.
The larger the speaker, the larger the phase difference will be, and narrower the beam is.
Shorter wavelengths need less time delay to cancel out, so the same size speaker will be more directional at higher frequencies.</p><p>With waves coming from just a two points, there are lots of other spots where they will coincidentally line up, but with enough sources that won’t happen anywhere except directly in front of it.</p><p>For those interested in making own, you can use this formula to estimate the beam half-angle from the length:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>angle of first null = asin(wavelength / (2 * size))
</code></pre><p>The shorter the array is in a direction the wider the beam will be in that direction.
When held horizontally, a rectangular array will create a vertical fan pattern, fairly well suited for our mostly horizontal world.</p><p>It’s also important to minimize the spacing between transducers, large gaps will cause beams of sound to come out at weird angles.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>I would also like to bring particular recognition to Raghu Ranganathan, also
known as <a href="https://github.com/razetime">@razetime</a>, who was an incredible
developer with an incredibly good attitude and contributing member to many
technical communities including code golfing and various programming languages
including Factor. We are very sad that <a href="https://codegolf.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/26416/in-memory-of-razetime">he passed
away</a>
a couple of months ago and would like to have this moment dedicated in his
memory.</p>

<p>In the <a href="https://valkey.io/blog/unlock-one-million-rps/">first part</a> of this blog, we described how we offloaded almost all I/O operations to I/O threads, thereby freeing more CPU cycles in the main thread to execute commands. When we profiled the execution of the main thread, we found that a considerable amount of time was spent waiting for external memory. This was not entirely surprising, as when accessing random keys, the probability of finding the key in one of the processor caches is relatively low.  Considering that external memory access latency is approximately 50 times higher than L1 cache, it became clear that despite showing 100% CPU utilization, the main process was mostly “waiting”. In this blog, we describe the technique we have been using to increase the number of parallel memory accesses, thereby reducing the impact that external memory latency has on performance.</p>
<h3 id="speculative-execution-and-linked-lists">Speculative execution and linked lists</h3>
<p>Speculative execution is a performance optimization technique used by modern processors, where the processor guesses the outcome of conditional operations and executes in parallel subsequent instructions ahead of time. Dynamic data structures, such as linked lists and search trees, have many advantages over static data structures: they are economical in memory consumption, provide fast insertion and deletion mechanisms, and can be resized efficiently. However, some dynamic data structures have a major drawback: they hinder the processor's ability to speculate on future memory load instructions that could be executed in parallel. This lack of concurrency is especially problematic in very large dynamic data structures, where most pointer accesses result in high-latency external memory access.</p>
<p>In this blog, Memory Access Amortization, a method that facilitates speculative execution to improve performance, is introduced along with how it is applied in Valkey. The basic idea behind the method is that by interleaving the execution of operations that access random memory locations, one can achieve significantly better performance than by executing them serially.</p>
<p>To depict the problem we are trying to solve consider the following <a href="https://valkey.io/assets/C/list_array.c">function</a> which gets an array of linked list and returns sum of all values in the lists:</p>
<pre data-lang="c"><code data-lang="c"><span>unsigned long </span><span>sequentialSum</span><span>(size_t </span><span>arr_size</span><span>, list **</span><span>la</span><span>) {
</span><span>    list *lp;
</span><span>    </span><span>unsigned long</span><span>  res = </span><span>0</span><span>; 
</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>for </span><span>(</span><span>int</span><span> i = </span><span>0</span><span>; i &lt; arr_size; i++) { 
</span><span>        lp = la[i]; 
</span><span>        </span><span>while </span><span>(lp) { 
</span><span>            res += lp-&gt;val;
</span><span>            lp = lp-&gt;next;
</span><span>        }
</span><span>    }
</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>return</span><span> res; 
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Executing this function on an array of 16 lists containing 10 million elements each takes approximately 20.8 seconds on an ARM processor (Graviton 3). Now consider the following alternative implementation which instead of scanning the lists separately,  interleaves the executions of the lists scans:</p>
<pre data-lang="c"><code data-lang="c"><span>unsigned long </span><span>interleavedSum</span><span>(size_t </span><span>arr_size</span><span>, list **</span><span>la</span><span>) {
</span><span>    list **lthreads = </span><span>malloc</span><span>(arr_size * sizeof(list *)); 
</span><span>    </span><span>unsigned long</span><span> res = </span><span>0</span><span>; 
</span><span>    </span><span>int</span><span> n = arr_size; 
</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>for </span><span>(</span><span>int</span><span> i = </span><span>0</span><span>; i &lt; arr_size; i++) {
</span><span>        lthreads[i] = la[i]; 
</span><span>        </span><span>if </span><span>(lthreads[i] == </span><span>NULL</span><span>) 
</span><span>            n--; 
</span><span>    } 
</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>while</span><span>(n) {
</span><span>        </span><span>for </span><span>(</span><span>int</span><span> i = </span><span>0</span><span>; i &lt; arr_size; i++) { 
</span><span>            </span><span>if </span><span>(lthreads[i] == </span><span>NULL</span><span>) 
</span><span>                </span><span>continue</span><span>; 
</span><span>            res += lthreads[i]-&gt;val;
</span><span>            lthreads[i] = lthreads[i]-&gt;next; 
</span><span>            </span><span>if </span><span>(lthreads[i] == </span><span>NULL</span><span>) 
</span><span>                n--;
</span><span>        }  
</span><span>    }
</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>free</span><span>(lthreads);
</span><span>    </span><span>return</span><span> res; 
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Running this new version with the same input as previously described takes less than 2 seconds, achieving a 10x speedup! The explanation for this significant improvement lies in the processor's speculative execution capabilities. In a standard sequential traversal of a linked list, as seen in the first version of the function, the processor cannot 'speculate' on future memory access instructions. This limitation becomes particularly costly with large lists, where each pointer access likely results in a expensive external memory access. In contrast, the alternative implementation, which interleaves list traversals, allows the processor to issue more memory accesses in parallel. This leads to an overall reduction in memory access latency through amortization.</p>
<p>One way to maximize the amount of parallel memory access issued is to add prefetch instructions. Replacing</p>
<pre data-lang="c"><code data-lang="c"><span>             </span><span>if </span><span>(lthreads[i] == </span><span>NULL</span><span>) 
</span><span>                n--;
</span></code></pre>
<p>with</p>
<pre data-lang="c"><code data-lang="c"><span>            </span><span>if </span><span>(lthreads[i]) 
</span><span>                </span><span>__builtin_prefetch</span><span>(lthreads[i]);
</span><span>            </span><span>else 
</span><span>                n--;
</span></code></pre>
<p>reduces the execution time further to 1.8 sec.</p>
<h3 id="back-to-valkey">Back to Valkey</h3>
<p>In the first part, we described how we updated the existing I/O threads implementation to increase parallelism and reduce the amount of I/O operations executed by the main thread to a minimum. Indeed, we observed an increase in the number of requests per second, reaching up to 780K SET commands per second. Profiling the execution revealed that Valkey's main thread was spending more than 40% of its time in a single function: lookupKey, whose goal is to locate the command keys in Valkey's main dictionary. This dictionary is implemented as a straightforward chained hash, as shown in the picture below:
<img src="https://valkey.io/assets/media/pictures/lookupKey.jpg" alt="dict find">
On a large enough set of keys, almost every memory address accessed while searching the dictionary will not be found in any of the processor caches, resulting in costly external memory accesses. Also, similarly as with the linked list from above, since the addresses in the table→dictEntry→...dictEntry→robj sequence are serially dependent, it is not possible to determine the next address to be accessed before the previous address in the chain has been resolved.</p>
<h3 id="batching-and-interleaving">Batching and interleaving</h3>
<p>To overcome this inefficiency, we adopted the following approach. Every time a batch of incoming commands from the I/O threads is ready for execution, Valkey’s main thread efficiently prefetches the memory addresses needed for future lookupKey invocations for the keys involved in the commands  before executing the commands. This prefetch phase is achieved by dictPrefetch, which, similarly as with the linked list example from above, interleaves the table→dictEntry→...dictEntry→robj search sequences for all keys. This reduces the time spent on lookupKey by more than 80%. Another issue we had to address was that all the incoming parsed commands from the I/O threads were not present in the L1/L2 caches of the core running Valkey’s main thread. This was also resolved using the same method.  All the relevant code can be found in <a href="https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey/blob/unstable/src/memory_prefetch.c">memory_prefetch.c</a>. In total the impact of the memory access amortization on Valkey performance is almost 50% and it increased the requests per second to more than 1.19M rps.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-reproduce-valkey-8-0-performance-numbers">How to reproduce Valkey 8.0 performance numbers</h3>
<p>This section will walk you through the process of reproducing our performance results, where we achieved 1.19 million requests per second using Valkey 8.</p>
<h3 id="hardware-setup">Hardware Setup</h3>
<p>We conducted our tests on an AWS EC2 c7g.4xlarge instance, featuring 16 cores on an ARM-based (aarch64) architecture.</p>
<h3 id="system-configuration">System Configuration</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: The core assignments used in this guide are examples. Optimal core selection may vary depending on your specific system configuration and workload.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interrupt affinity - locate the network interface with <code>ifconfig</code> (let's assume it is <code>eth0</code>) and its associated IRQs with</p>
<pre data-lang="bash"><code data-lang="bash"><span>grep</span><span> eth0 /proc/interrupts | </span><span>awk </span><span>'</span><span>{print $1}</span><span>' | </span><span>cut -d</span><span> :</span><span> -f</span><span> 1
</span></code></pre>
<p>In our setup, lines <code>48</code> to <code>55</code> are allocated for <code>eth0</code> interrupts. Allocate one core per 4 IRQ lines:</p>
<pre data-lang="bash"><code data-lang="bash"><span>for</span><span> i </span><span>in </span><span>{48..50}; </span><span>do </span><span>echo</span><span> 1000 &gt; /proc/irq/$</span><span>i</span><span>/smp_affinity; </span><span>done
</span><span>for</span><span> i </span><span>in </span><span>{51..55}; </span><span>do </span><span>echo</span><span> 2000 &gt; /proc/irq/$</span><span>i</span><span>/smp_affinity; </span><span>done  
</span></code></pre>
<p>Server configuration - launch the Valkey server with these minimal configurations:</p>
<pre data-lang="bash"><code data-lang="bash"><span>./valkey-server --io-threads</span><span> 9</span><span> --save --protected-mode</span><span> no
</span></code></pre>
<p><code>--save</code> disables dumping to RDB file and <code>--protected-mode no </code>  allows connections from external hosts. <code>--io-threads</code> number includes the main thread and the IO threads, meaning that in our case 8 I/O threads are launched in addition to the main thread.</p>
<p>Main thread affinity - pin the main thread to a specific CPU core, avoiding the cores handling IRQs. Here we use core #3:</p>
<pre data-lang="bash"><code data-lang="bash"><span>sudo</span><span> taskset</span><span> -cp</span><span> 3 `</span><span>pidof</span><span> valkey-server`
</span></code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Important: We suggest experimenting with different core pinning strategies to find the optimal performance while avoiding conflicts with IRQ-handling cores.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="benchmark-configuration">Benchmark Configuration</h3>
<p>Run the benchmark from a separate instance using the following parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>Value size: 512 bytes</li>
<li>Number of keys: 3 million</li>
<li>Number of clients: 650</li>
<li>Number of threads: 50 (may vary for optimal results)</li>
</ul>
<pre data-lang="bash"><code data-lang="bash"><span>./valkey-benchmark -t</span><span> set</span><span> -d</span><span> 512</span><span> -r</span><span> 3000000</span><span> -c</span><span> 650</span><span> --threads</span><span> 50</span><span> -h </span><span>"</span><span>host-name</span><span>"</span><span> -n</span><span> 100000000000
</span></code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Important: When running the benchmark, it may take a few seconds for the database to get populated and for the performance to stabilize. You can adjust the <code>-n</code> parameter to ensure the benchmark runs long enough to reach optimal throughput.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="testing-and-availability">Testing and Availability</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey/releases/tag/8.0.0-rc2">Valkey 8.0 RC2</a> is available now for evaluation with I/O threads and memory access amortization.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><em>From the swimming habits of dead trout to the revelation that some mammals can breathe through their backsides, a group of leading leftfield scientists have been taking their bows at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for the 34th annual <a href="https://improbable.com/ig/about-the-ig-nobel-prizes/">Ig Nobel Prize</a> ceremony. Not to be confused with the actual Nobel prizes, the Ig Nobels recognise scientific discoveries that “make people laugh, then think”.</em> </p>

<p><em>We caught up with one of this year’s winners, Saul Justin Newman, a senior research fellow at the University College London Centre for Longitudinal Studies. His research finds that most of the claims about people living over 105 are wrong.</em></p>

<h2>How did you find out about your award?</h2>

<p>I picked up the phone after slogging through traffic and rain to a bloke from Cambridge in the UK. He told me about this prize and the first thing I thought of was the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-11447095">lady who</a> collected snot off of whales and the <a href="https://www.iflscience.com/in-1997-scientists-made-a-frog-levitate-63041">levitating frog</a>. I said, “absolutely I want to be in this club”. </p>

<h2>What was the ceremony like?</h2>

<p>The ceremony was wonderful. It’s a bit of fun in a big fancy hall. It’s like you take the most serious ceremony possible and make fun of every aspect of it. </p>

<h2>But your work is actually incredibly serious?</h2>

<p>I started getting interested in this topic when I <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000048">debunked</a> a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6039923/">couple of papers</a> in Nature and Science about extreme ageing in the 2010s. In general, the claims about how long people are living mostly don’t stack up. I’ve tracked down 80% of the people aged over 110 in the world (the other 20% are from countries you can’t meaningfully analyse). Of those, almost none have a birth certificate. In the US there are over 500 of these people; seven have a birth certificate. Even worse, only about 10% have a death certificate. </p>

<p>The epitome of this is blue zones, which are regions where people supposedly reach age 100 at a remarkable rate. For almost 20 years, they have been marketed to the public. They’re the subject of tons of scientific work, a popular <a href="https://media.netflix.com/en/only-on-netflix/81214929">Netflix documentary</a>, tons of cookbooks about things like the Mediterranean diet, and so on.</p>

<p>Okinawa in Japan is one of these zones. There was a <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-11299646">Japanese government review</a> in 2010, which found that 82% of the people aged over 100 in Japan turned out to be dead. The secret to living to 110 was, don’t register your death. </p>

<p>The Japanese government has run one of the <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/704080v3.full">largest nutritional surveys</a> in the world, dating back to 1975. From then until now, Okinawa has had the worst health in Japan. They’ve eaten the least vegetables; they’ve been extremely heavy drinkers. </p>

<h2>What about other places?</h2>

<p>The same goes for all the other blue zones. Eurostat keeps track of life expectancy in Sardinia, the Italian blue zone, and Ikaria in Greece. When the agency first <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Mortality_and_life_expectancy_statistics#Life_expectancy_at_age_65">started keeping records</a> in 1990, Sardinia had the 51st highest old-age life expectancy in Europe out of 128 regions, and Ikaria was 109th. It’s amazing the cognitive dissonance going on. With the Greeks, <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/704080v3.full">by my estimates</a> at least 72% of centenarians were dead, missing or essentially pension-fraud cases.</p>

<h2>What do you think explains most of the faulty data?</h2>

<p>It varies. In Okinawa, the best predictor of where the centenarians are is where the halls of records were bombed by the Americans during the war. That’s for two reasons. If the person dies, they stay on the books of some other national registry, which hasn’t confirmed their death. Or if they live, they go to an occupying government that doesn’t speak their language, works on a different calendar and screws up their age. </p>

<p>According to the Greek minister that hands out the pensions, over 9,000 people over the age of 100 are dead and collecting a pension at the same time. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/16/world/italy-s-dead-pensioners.html">In Italy</a>, some 30,000 “living” pension recipients were found to be dead in 1997. </p>

<p>Regions where people most often reach 100-110 years old are the ones where there’s the most pressure to commit pension fraud, and they also have the worst records. For example, the best place to reach 105 in England is Tower Hamlets. It has more 105-year-olds than all of the rich places in England put together. It’s closely followed by downtown Manchester, Liverpool and Hull. <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/704080v3.full">Yet these places</a> have the lowest frequency of 90-year-olds and are rated by the UK as the worst places to be an old person.</p>

<p>The oldest man in the world, John Tinniswood, supposedly aged 112, is from a very rough part of Liverpool. The easiest explanation is that someone has written down his age wrong at some point. </p>

<h2>But most people don’t lose count of their age…</h2>

<p>You would be amazed. Looking at the <a href="https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/">UK Biobank data</a>, even people in mid-life routinely don’t remember how old they are, or how old they were when they had their children. There are similar stats from the US. </p>

<h2>What does this all mean for human longevity?</h2>

<p>The question is so obscured by fraud and error and wishful thinking that we just do not know. The clear way out of this is to involve physicists to develop a measure of human age that doesn’t depend on documents. We can then use that to build metrics that help us measure human ages. </p>

<p>Longevity data are used for projections of future lifespans, and those are used to set everyone’s pension rate. You’re talking about trillions of dollars of pension money. If the data is junk then so are those projections. It also means we’re allocating the wrong amounts of money to plan hospitals to take care of old people in the future. Your insurance premiums are based on this stuff. </p>

<h2>What’s your best guess about true human longevity?</h2>

<p>Longevity is very likely tied to wealth. Rich people do lots of exercise, have low stress and eat well. I just put out <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.09.06.24313170v1">a preprint</a> analysing the last 72 years of UN data on mortality. The places consistently reaching 100 at the highest rates according to the UN are Thailand, Malawi, Western Sahara (which doesn’t have a government) and Puerto Rico, where birth certificates were cancelled completely as a legal document in 2010 because they were so full of pension fraud. This data is just rotten from the inside out. </p>

<h2>Do you think the Ig Nobel will get your science taken more seriously?</h2>

<p>I hope so. But even if not, at least the general public will laugh and think about it, even if the scientific community is still a bit prickly and defensive. If they don’t acknowledge their errors in my lifetime, I guess I’ll just get someone to pretend I’m still alive until that changes.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p><b>September 12, 2024</b></p>
<p><strong><newslead>Doctor Web experts have uncovered yet another case of an Android-based TV box infection. The malware, dubbed <a href="https://vms.drweb.com/search/?q=Android.Vo1d&amp;lng=en"><b>Android.Vo1d</b></a>, has infected nearly 1.3 million devices belonging to users in 197 countries. It is a backdoor that puts its components in the system storage area and, when commanded by attackers, is capable of secretly downloading and installing third-party software.</newslead></strong></p>

<p>In August 2024, Doctor Web was contacted by several users whose Dr.Web antivirus had detected changes in their device’s system file area. The problem occurred with these models:</p>

<table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>TV box model</th>
        <th>Declared firmware version</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>R4</td>
        <td>Android 7.1.2; R4 Build/NHG47K</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>TV BOX</td>
        <td>Android 12.1; TV BOX Build/NHG47K</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>KJ-SMART4KVIP</td>
        <td>Android 10.1; KJ-SMART4KVIP Build/NHG47K</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>All these cases involved similar signs of infection, so we will describe them using one of the first requests we received as an example. The following objects were changed on the affected TV box:</p>
<ul>
  <li><span>install-recovery.sh</span></li>
  <li><span>daemonsu</span></li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, 4 new files emerged in its file system:</p>
<ul>
  <li><span>/system/xbin/vo1d</span></li>
  <li><span>/system/xbin/wd</span></li>
  <li><span>/system/bin/debuggerd</span></li>
  <li><span>/system/bin/debuggerd_real</span></li>
</ul>

<p>The <span>vo1d</span> and <span>wd</span> files are the components of the <a href="https://vms.drweb.com/search/?q=Android.Vo1d&amp;lng=en"><b>Android.Vo1d</b></a> trojan that we discovered.</p>

<blockquote>
  The trojan’s authors probably tried to disguise one if its components as the system program /system/bin/vold, having called it by the similar-looking name “vo1d” (substituting the lowercase letter “l” with the number “1”). The malicious program’s name comes from the name of this file. Moreover, this spelling is consonant with the English word “void”.
</blockquote>

<p>The <span>install-recovery.sh</span> file is a script that is present on most Android devices. It runs when the operating system is launched and contains data for autorunning the elements specified in it. If any malware has root access and the ability to write to the <span>/system</span> system directory, it can anchor itself in the infected device by adding itself to this script (or by creating it from scratch if it is not present in the system). <a href="https://vms.drweb.com/search/?q=Android.Vo1d&amp;lng=en"><b>Android.Vo1d</b></a> has registered the autostart for the <span>wd</span> component in this file.</p>

<p><a href="https://st.drweb.com/static/new-www/news/2024/september/01_recovery.png">
    <img src="https://st.drweb.com/static/new-www/news/2024/september/01_recovery.png" alt="The modified install-recovery.sh file">
  </a>
</p>
<p><em>The modified install-recovery.sh file</em></p>

<p>The <span>daemonsu</span> file is present on many Android devices with root access. It is launched by the operating system when it starts and is responsible for providing root privileges to the user. <a href="https://vms.drweb.com/search/?q=Android.Vo1d&amp;lng=en"><b>Android.Vo1d</b></a> registered itself in this file, too, having also set up autostart for the <span>wd</span> module.</p>

<p>The <span>debuggerd</span> file is a daemon that is typically used to create reports on occurred errors. But when the TV box was infected, this file was replaced by the script that launches the <span>wd</span> component.</p>

<p>The <span>debuggerd_real</span> file in the case we are reviewing is a copy of the script that was used to substitute the real <span>debuggerd</span> file. Doctor Web experts believe that the trojan’s authors intended the original <span>debuggerd</span> to be moved into <span>debuggerd_real</span> to maintain its functionality. However, because the infection probably occurred twice, the trojan moved the already substituted file (i.e., the script). As a result, the device had two scripts from the trojan and not a single real <span>debuggerd</span> program file.</p>

<p>At the same time, other users who contacted us had a slightly different list of files on their infected devices:</p>
<ul>
  <li><span>daemonsu</span> (the <span>vo1d</span> file analogue — <a href="https://vms.drweb.com/search/?q=Android.Vo1d.1&amp;lng=en"><b>Android.Vo1d.1</b></a>);</li>
  <li><span>wd</span> (<a href="https://vms.drweb.com/search/?q=Android.Vo1d.3&amp;lng=en"><b>Android.Vo1d.3</b></a>);</li>
  <li><span>debuggerd</span> (the same script as described above);</li>
  <li><span>debuggerd_real</span> (the original file of the <span>debuggerd</span> tool);</li>
  <li><span>install-recovery.sh</span> (a script that loads objects specified in it).  </li>
</ul>

<p>An analysis of all the aforementioned files showed that in order to anchor <a href="https://vms.drweb.com/search/?q=Android.Vo1d%20in%20the&amp;lng=en"><b>Android.Vo1d in the</b></a> system, its authors used at least three different methods: modification of the <span>install-recovery.sh</span> and <span>daemonsu</span> files and substitution of the <span>debuggerd</span> program. They probably expected that at least one of the target files would be present in the infected system, since manipulating even one of them would ensure the trojan’s successful auto launch during subsequent device reboots. </p>

<p><a href="https://vms.drweb.com/search/?q=Android.Vo1d&amp;lng=en"><b>Android.Vo1d</b></a>’s main functionality is concealed in its <span>vo1d</span> (<a href="https://vms.drweb.com/search/?q=Android.Vo1d.1&amp;lng=en"><b>Android.Vo1d.1</b></a>) and <span>wd</span> (<a href="https://vms.drweb.com/search/?q=Android.Vo1d.3&amp;lng=en"><b>Android.Vo1d.3</b></a>) components, which operate in tandem. The <a href="https://vms.drweb.com/search/?q=Android.Vo1d.1&amp;lng=en"><b>Android.Vo1d.1</b></a> module is responsible for <a href="https://vms.drweb.com/search/?q=Android.Vo1d.3&amp;lng=en"><b>Android.Vo1d.3</b></a>’s launch and controls its activity, restarting its process if necessary. In addition, it can download and run executables when commanded to do so by the C&amp;C server. In turn, the <a href="https://vms.drweb.com/search/?q=Android.Vo1d.3&amp;lng=en"><b>Android.Vo1d.3</b></a> module installs and launches the <a href="https://vms.drweb.com/search/?q=Android.Vo1d.5&amp;lng=en"><b>Android.Vo1d.5</b></a> daemon that is encrypted and stored in its body. This module can also download and run executables. Moreover, it monitors specified directories and installs the APK files that it finds in them.</p>

<p>A study conducted by Doctor Web malware analysts showed that the <a href="https://vms.drweb.com/search/?q=Android.Vo1d&amp;lng=en"><b>Android.Vo1d</b></a> backdoor has infected around 1.3 million devices, while its geographical distribution included almost 200 countries. The largest number of infections were detected in Brazil, Morocco, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Russia, Argentina, Ecuador, Tunisia, Malaysia, Algeria, and Indonesia.</p>

    <img src="https://st.drweb.com/static/new-www/news/2024/september/02_Android.Vo1d_map_en.png" alt="Countries with the highest number of infected devices detected">
  </a>
</p>
<p><em>Countries with the highest number of infected devices detected</em></p>

<p>One possible reason why the attackers distributing <a href="https://vms.drweb.com/search/?q=Android.Vo1d&amp;lng=en"><b>Android.Vo1d</b></a> specifically chose TV boxes is that such devices often run on outdated Android versions, which have unpatched vulnerabilities and are no longer supported with updates. For example, the users who contacted us have models that are based on Android 7.1, despite the fact that for some of them the configuration indicates much newer versions, such as Android 10 and Android 12. Unfortunately, it is not uncommon for budget device manufacturers to utilize older OS versions and pass them off as more up-to-date ones to make them more attractive.</p>

<p>In addition, users themselves may mistakenly perceive TV boxes to be better protected devices, compared to smartphones. As a result, they may install anti-virus software on these less often and risk encountering malware when downloading third-party apps or installing unofficial firmware. </p>

<p>At the moment, the source of the TV boxes’ backdoor infection remains unknown. One possible infection vector could be an attack by an intermediate malware that exploits operating system vulnerabilities to gain root privileges. Another possible vector could be the use of unofficial firmware versions with built-in root access.</p>

<p>Dr.Web anti-virus for Android successfully detects all known <a href="https://vms.drweb.com/search/?q=Android.Vo1d&amp;lng=en"><b>Android.Vo1d</b></a> trojan variants, and, if root access is available, cures the infected devices.</p>

<p>Apple has unveiled a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.macobserver.com/news/users-can-adjust-video-speed-in-post-processing-on-ios-18/" data-wpel-link="internal">new feature in iOS 18</a> that extends Activation Lock to individual iPhone components. This update, set to roll out on September 16, 2024.</p>
<p>So, what’s new? The latest iOS update brings Activation Lock to iPhone components like</p>
<ul>
<li>Batteries</li>
<li>Cameras</li>
<li>Displays</li>
</ul>
<p>Each part is now linked to the owner’s Apple Account via its unique serial number, which means it has now an additional layer of security.</p>
<p>But, how does it work? When an iPhone detects a used part during repair, it will now request the Apple Account password of the original device owner. This process will verify the legitimacy of the component and prevent the use of parts from stolen or lost devices.</p>
<p>From the looks for it, Apple’s primary goal with this feature is to disrupt the market for stolen iPhone parts. By making it more difficult to use components from stolen devices, the company hopes to reduce the incentive for iPhone theft overall.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: This feature is currently exclusive to iPhones and will not be available on iPads with iPadOS 18</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While this update strengthens security, it may complicate some repair processes, especially those involving parts from other devices. However, it aligns with Apple’s recent policy changes that allow repairs with genuine used parts while maintaining stringent security measures.</p>
<p>The stolen iPhones were already pretty much useless until the user deleted their device from their “Find My,” but now they’re even more useless as even their spare parts won’t do any good.</p>
