<p><span><span><span><span>Elbilernes salgskurve er de seneste år gået stejlt opad, og mere end hver anden solgte nye bil er nu en elbil. Det mærker man nu også ude i landets synshaller, hvor elbiler ikke længere er et særsyn. Lige Godt 28.000 elbiler var i de første 11 måneder af 2024 til periodisk syn. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Det er dog langtfra alle elbiler, der klarer turen på liften lige godt. Især én model falder igennem: Tesla Model 3. Den populære elbil, som der kører i alt 35.000 af på de danske veje, blev lanceret i 2019, og dermed har den første store årgang været til sit første periodiske bilsyn i det forgangne år.</span></span></span></span></p>





<h2><span><span><span><span>Rasende høj dumpeprocent</span></span></span></span></h2>

<p><span><span><span>Af de 4.668 Tesla Model 3 årgang 2020, som mellem 1. januar og 21. november sidste år var til syn, dumpede de 1.051. Det svarer til 23 procent. Til sammenligning dumpede ’kun’ 9 procent af de øvrige elbiler, der var til syn i 2024, viser tal fra Færdselsstyrelsen, som FDM Test &amp; Bilsyn har analyseret. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>– Det er en rasende høj dumpeprocent for Tesla Model 3, som Færdselsstyrelsens synsdata afslører, men det er desværre ikke noget, som overrasker os. Tallene indikerer, at kvaliteten og holdbarheden af Tesla Model 3, i hvert fald de første årgange, ikke er på niveau med andre bilmærker. Det er noget, vi også oplever, og som vi holder øje med, siger områdechef i FDMs tekniske rådgivning Lone Otto. </span></span></span></p>

<h2>Tesla har mere end hver 3. af alle fejl</h2>

<p><span><span><span>I</span></span></span><span><span><span>&nbsp;alt blev der fundet 1.392 fejl på de Tesla Model 3 årgang 2020, svarende til 0,3 fejl pr. synet model. Dermed blev der fundet tre gange så mange fejl i forhold til de øvrige elbiler, som blev synet sidste år. </span></span></span></p>



<p><span><span><span><span>Billedet fra de danske synshaller af Tesla Model 3 stemmer overens med synstal fra Tyskland. Også her faldt bilmodellen igennem i den årlige synsrapport fra tyske TÜV, der bl.a. syner biler. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Det er særligt fejlgrupperne „bremseudstyr“, „lygteudstyr“, „aksler, hjul og dæk“ samt „styretøj“, som bilerne dumper på. Noget man i FDMs tekniske rådgivning kan nikke genkendende til. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>– Elbiler bremser på en anden måde, og derfor er problemer med bremserne velkendt. Men det er kritisk, at problemer med hjulophæng og ratslør er så udtalt på en bil, der ikke er ældre end Tesla Model 3. Det ser vi ikke på andre biler. Det samme gælder Teslas overrepræsentation af fejl på lygter, som ofte enten er løse, eller som blænder, siger Lone Otto</span></span></span></p>

<h2><span><span><span>62.000 elbiler skal til syn i år</span></span></span></h2>

<p><span><span><span>Det kommende år skal 62.000 elbiler til syn herhjemme – de 45.000 for første gang. Heriblandt Tesla Model 3 årgang 2021 og ikke mindst den første årgang af Tesla Model Y, der er den mest solgte elbil i Danmark. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>– Vi har ingen grund til at tro, at yngre årgange af Tesla Model 3 vil adskille sig væsentligt fra årgang 2020, når det gælder fejl og dermed også dumpeprocent. Mere spændende bliver det at se, hvordan Tesla Model Y vil klare sig, siger Lone Otto og tilføjer:</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>– Tesla har fire års garanti på sine biler. Det passer med deres første syn. Et godt råd er derfor at få bilen gennemgået af en uvildig, inden man når skæringsdatoen. I det hele taget anbefaler vi, at man løbende servicerer sin bil og får gennemgået bilens bremser og generelle stand. Gerne en gang om året. Det gælder uanset bilmærke, eller om bilen overhovedet har et fast serviceinterval.</span></span></span></p>

<p>Opdateret 24. januar:</p>

<p><span><span>FDM har bedt Tesla om en kommentar til dels synstallene for deres Model 3 dels kritikken af bilens kvalitet. Det er ikke lykkedes at få. I en mail til FDM gør Tesla dog opmærksom på, at Tesla Model 3 fik et større facelift i 2021, og at modellen i 2023 kom i en ny og markant forbedret udgave. </span></span></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <article>
    <p>It happened on the afternoon of May 4th. A message from a colleague—who has since become a good friend—popped up on my screen, urging me to check my emails. When I opened my inbox, there it was: an email from the COO. The email announced an impending company-wide layoff and mentioned that, within a few minutes, I’d receive another email letting me know whether I was impacted. A short while later, the second email arrived. I was among those affected—along with most of my team.</p>

<p>The situation felt surreal. One by one, my colleagues posted in our team chat, confirming they’d been impacted too. Before our accounts were locked, we quickly jumped on a call. We had just 30 minutes to have one final conversation as a team, to say our goodbyes. It was a bittersweet moment, sharing those last words with people I’d worked so closely with.</p>

<p>It was difficult to process what was happening. Just ten months earlier, the company had gone through another round of layoffs. And at the beginning of the year, during the company’s kick-off event, the president assured us there wouldn’t be any more layoffs. They even said the company was performing well financially. So, why was this happening?</p>

<h2 id="signs-of-a-layoff">Signs of a Layoff</h2>

<p>Looking back, my colleagues and I were not entirely surprised by the layoff. There were several warning signs that hinted something was coming. I want to share these signs so you can be better prepared if you ever face a similar situation.</p>

<h3 id="1-cancellation-of-team-events">1. Cancellation of Team Events</h3>
<p>One of the earliest indicators was the sudden cancellation of team events. When I heard from other teams that their off-site events were canceled without any clear explanation, it immediately raised red flags. These cancellations often signal that the company is going to announce something about the team structure and doesn’t want you to be with your team in the same place. This is because one of your teammates—or you—might be impacted, and you’d need to cancel flights, hotels, etc. To avoid dealing with these logistical issues, the company preemptively cancels the event.</p>

<h3 id="2-unexpected-notifications-about-packages">2. Unexpected Notifications About Packages</h3>
<p>Some employees at the company received notifications about packages scheduled to arrive at their homes. This happens because services like DHL notify you through their app when a package is on the way. If your company requires you to return your work equipment, like a laptop, after being laid off, they often arrange for these shipping boxes to be delivered in advance. If you unexpectedly see a notification about a package from your company’s IT provider, it’s a strong sign that a layoff is imminent—and you may be impacted.</p>

<h3 id="3-lack-of-vision-from-leadership">3. Lack of Vision from Leadership</h3>
<p>The absence of a clear vision from leadership is one of the most common signs of an impending layoff. During off-site or kick-off events, you might notice that leaders seem unsure of the company’s direction. When this lack of clarity is followed by team restructuring, and then another restructuring just a few months later, it becomes evident that the leadership is struggling to find focus. Ultimately, this cycle often ends with a layoff, accompanied by yet another round of restructuring for those who remain.</p>

<h3 id="4-sudden-vague-meetings">4. Sudden, Vague Meetings</h3>
<p>Another sign is the appearance of unexpected, vague meetings on your calendar. These meetings are marked as “important” with no clear agenda, and attendance is mandatory. If this happens, it’s often a precursor to a layoff announcement. Public companies, in particular, may choose to send layoff notices via email to align the timing with when they notify investors.</p>

<h3 id="5-timing-around-quarterly-results">5. Timing Around Quarterly Results</h3>

<p>If your company is publicly traded, layoffs are frequently announced in conjunction with quarterly earnings reports. This can be especially stressful because, leading up to every financial results announcement, employees may anxiously wait to see if layoffs will accompany the news. If no layoffs are announced, you know you’re safe—for at least one more quarter.</p>

<h2 id="youre-just-a-row-in-an-excel-table">You’re Just a Row in an Excel Table</h2>

<p>When I looked back on my time at the company and all the things I had accomplished, I was surprised to be impacted by the layoffs. It wasn’t because I thought I was better than others—it was because I believed I was doing more than what was expected of me. However, during a layoff, it seems that who you are and what you do doesn’t matter. In most cases, the decision is made by people who don’t even know you. This realization made me question the concept of work, which is part of the reason I’m writing this blog post.</p>

<p>I was hired as a Backend Developer. When I joined my team, I noticed a project that needed a developer to implement the client-side feature in React Native. Although I had no prior experience with React Native, I had worked with React before, so I volunteered for the task. I shipped the feature without any issues, received positive feedback from my team and lead, and eventually, my title was changed to Developer, making me a full-stack developer.</p>

<p>In some instances, I worked on projects independently, always aligning with my team and ensuring my work was reviewed. I would implement the backend first and then move on to the client-side. This was my expected role, and in performance reviews, I was consistently rated as a high performer. Yet, I was always doing more than what was expected of me.</p>

<p>Sometimes, I worked on small features I thought would enhance the app. These features might not have been used by many, but they provided significant value to heavy users. Occasionally, I shipped these under the radar. I created dashboards to measure the impact of my team’s work, helping us focus on features that would bring the most value to users. I also built proof-of-concept features based on user requests to show leadership how easily they could be implemented, advocating for their prioritization. Additionally, I participated in hackdays, creating projects to showcase innovative ideas.</p>

<p>On several occasions, I was selected for special projects outside my team. These projects often came directly from the CEO, and I was chosen because I constantly wanted to do more for the company and our users. For some of these projects, I worked more than eight hours a day, including weekends. A few of these initiatives were mentioned in financial reports, praised by the CEO during all-hands meetings, or retweeted multiple times by the CEO on Twitter.</p>

<p>Over time, I gained the attention of senior management in my business unit, which consisted of about 400 people. I began directly interacting with the VP of Product and the VP of Engineering, both of whom were four or five levels above me. Occasionally, the VP of Product would message me directly to ask if a feature was feasible to implement. Later, the VP of Engineering started scheduling regular one-on-one meetings with me, which was highly uncommon. During these calls, he told me multiple times that if I continued working at this level, I could quickly climb the ladder to become a Staff Developer. He wasn’t the only one saying this to me.</p>

<p>Beyond my immediate role, I also sought ways to contribute to the broader company. Whenever a new tool was introduced, I would explore it, write detailed articles about my findings, and share them to help other teams use the tool more effectively.</p>

<p>I referred many friends and former colleagues to the company because I believed in its mission. If I recall correctly, I referred over ten people, four of whom received offers, and three were ultimately hired. I also encouraged many others to consider joining the company.</p>

<p>I even initiated discussions about translating our website into Turkish to support the many customers we had in Turkey. A few weeks before the layoff announcement, I was helping a team working on this project find a Turkish-speaking content designer because they noticed my willingness to assist.</p>

<p>Additionally, I tried to convince friends who were CTOs at major e-commerce companies to migrate their websites to our platform. Whenever I received job offers from e-commerce companies on LinkedIn, I used those opportunities to promote our platform instead. I passed along leads to the sales team and later noticed that one of those companies had indeed moved to our platform.</p>

<p>I’m not sharing all of this to brag but to highlight that, in the end, none of it mattered. On the day I announced I had been laid off, I received numerous messages from colleagues, even those I hadn’t worked with directly, telling me that I had inspired and motivated them. While those messages were heartwarming, they didn’t change the reality: to the company, I was just a row in an Excel sheet.</p>

<h2 id="the-broken-trust-of-modern-work">The Broken Trust of Modern Work</h2>

<p>Layoffs were uncommon when I started working, and being a developer felt like an incredibly safe job. In most professions, the unspoken rule was simple: if you performed well and the company was financially stable, your job was secure.</p>

<p>But today, companies are announcing layoffs alongside record-breaking financial results. You work hard, focus on impactful projects, and receive praise from your lead—only to find yourself let go by someone who likely doesn’t even know you exist. It feels as though the trust between companies and employees is now broken. Companies, it seems, are either unaware of this shift or unwilling to address it. And frankly, I’m not sure how they could fix it.</p>

<p>What’s particularly strange is that the layoffs predominantly affect individual contributors—the people who have little say in deciding the company’s direction. These are the team members closest to the users, the ones who spend hours planning how to improve the product. But after those plans are made, leadership often swoops in and redirects efforts toward entirely different goals. You trust their judgment, work on their priorities, and deliver on time. Then, when the arbitrary goals they set aren’t met, the company decides to cut staff. Those who made the poor decisions remain, and some are even promoted, while the people carrying out the work are let go. It feels surreal—like <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u48vYSLvKNQ">an episode from Silicon Valley</a>—but this is how big companies operate.</p>

<p>I’m not alone in feeling this way. Many friends and ex-colleagues who’ve been laid off in recent years share similar experiences. They’ve lost trust in their employers. They believe their efforts won’t matter in the long run and anticipate being part of the next layoff cycle. As a result, they only do what’s strictly required to avoid a performance improvement plan. No one goes above and beyond anymore; no one takes initiative to improve things. Why? Because it doesn’t matter. They’ve seen firsthand that it changes nothing.</p>

<p>For those like me who’ve experienced layoffs, work has become just that—work. You do what’s assigned, and if your company squanders your potential or forces you to waste time on unnecessary projects, you simply stop caring. You collect your paycheck at the end of the month, and that’s it. This is the new modern work: no more striving to be 40% better every year.</p>

<h2 id="the-myth-of-job-security-in-germany">The Myth of Job Security in Germany</h2>

<p>Since I was working for a German entity of a company, I want to address a common myth about job security in Germany. Many people believe that it’s nearly impossible to be fired in Germany. While this is partially true for individuals who have completed their probation period, it doesn’t hold up in the context of layoffs. If a company decides to lay off, for instance, 40 employees, German law doesn’t prevent this. Instead, the law enforces a social scoring system to determine who is affected, prioritizing the protection of the most vulnerable employees, such as those with children. In this sense, when it comes to layoffs, the difference between Germany and the US is minimal.</p>

<h2 id="suggestions-for-those-who-havent-been-laid-off-yet">Suggestions for Those Who Haven’t Been Laid Off (Yet)</h2>

<p>When I talk to friends who were laid off in recent years, we often reflect on what we could have done differently. Here are some of the lessons we’ve learned:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Stick to your contract hours.</strong> If your contract says 40 hours, work 40 hours—no more, no less. Protect your personal time and well-being.</li>
  <li><strong>Avoid going above and beyond with initiatives.</strong> Many companies encourage impactful work to earn promotions, but instead of chasing internal advancements, focus on switching companies to achieve your next career step.</li>
  <li><strong>Always keep interviewing.</strong> One of the biggest mistakes I’ve seen is stopping interviews after starting a new job, trusting in the company. Instead, continuously explore opportunities so that if a layoff happens, you already have other options lined up.</li>
  <li><strong>Leverage external offers for salary growth.</strong> Companies often resist giving substantial raises to existing employees but pay top dollar for new hires. Regularly interview elsewhere, and if you get an offer with a 20% or higher salary increase, consider taking it. Many people have seen their compensation triple or quadruple this way in just a few years.</li>
  <li><strong>Don’t overthink your résumé.</strong> Worrying about short experiences on your CV isn’t worth it. You can always tailor your résumé—leave out brief roles, or consolidate short-term jobs as freelance experience. Ultimately, your résumé is just a starting point; your skills will be assessed during the interview process.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>You’ve probably noticed that I didn’t mention the name of the company I was laid off from. That’s because I believe it’s irrelevant. Everything I’ve shared reflects the current state of the tech industry. It might differ at very small companies, but once you work at a company with more than 100 employees, you’ll likely encounter many of the same patterns I’ve described.</p>

<p>I’ve wanted to write about this topic for a long time, but it’s been difficult to find the energy. The subject itself is a deep disappointment for me, and every time I reflect on layoffs, it makes me profoundly sad. It’s a stark reminder of how companies treat workers as disposable. Before you join, they go to great lengths to make you feel valued and excited to accept their offer. You meet multiple people, and some even offer signing bonuses. But when layoffs come, you’re reduced to a name on a list. During the exit interview, a random person from the company reads a prepared script and can’t answer your questions. The HR team that once worked to make you feel valued doesn’t even conduct an actual conversation with you. That random person becomes the last connection you have to a company you spent years at.</p>

<p>The layoff fundamentally changed how I perceive work now. I don’t think that I’ll be the same person again.</p>

                    <h2>Textual programming made easy!</h2>
                    
                    <p>Many schools and teachers around the world want to teach their students programming. Initially this is often done with playful tools, ranging from the Beebot robot to
Scratch Junior or Scratch. After using such tools, kids often want to move to more powerful, textual programming languages, like Python.</p>
<p>Python however is hard, because it is only available in English, and requires learners to learn complex programming concepts and syntax at once.
Hedy is the easy way to get started with textual programming languages! Hedy is free to use, open source, and unlike any other textual programming language in three ways.</p>
<ol>
<li>Hedy is multi-lingual, you can use Hedy in your own language</li>
<li>Hedy is gradual, so you can learn one concept and its syntax a time</li>
<li>Hedy is built for the classroom, allowing teachers to fully customize their student's experience</li>
</ol>

                        <h3>Step by step learning</h3>
                        <p>Learning a programming language can be overwhelming, since learners have to learn concepts (for example if-else or loops) and syntax (like quotation marks or round brackets) at the same time. In Hedy, concepts are first introduced with little syntax and then refined. A scientifically proven way to learn!</p>

                        <p>Hedy is suitable for kids aged 10 and up and designed for classroom use.
Teachers can use our free, built-in lesson plans, but can also author their own lessons and load these into the Hedy user interface.</p>

                    <h2>Programming in context</h2>
                    
                    <p>Hedy shows programming in the broadest way possible, and can be used in variety of exciting ways. Hedy allows for the creation of digital and interactive stories, colorful drawings that can be shown on the screen but also drawn with a pen plotter or embroidered on a shirt, and can be used to create games or apps with buttons and keyboard actions.</p>

                </div>
        
        <div>
                    
                    <div>
                        <h3>Is Hedy free?</h3>
                        <p>Yes! Hedy is 'Open source', which means that everyone can help us make Hedy better.
You can find our code on <a href="https://github.com/hedyorg/hedy" target="_blank">Github</a>.
If you like Hedy and want to contribute, we accept (and are very grateful for) <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/hedyorg" target="_blank">donations</a>!</p>

                    </div>
                    
                    <div>
                        <h3>Do I need to install anything?</h3>
                        <p>No. Hedy works in the browser, which is the program you are using to look at this page. Probably Chrome or Edge or Firefox. Hedy also works on phones and tablets.</p>

                    </div>
                    
                    <div>
                        <h3>Do I need programming experience to teach with Hedy?</h3>
                        <p>No, that is not needed. All concepts are explained in the slides and in the interface for learners.
If you create a free teacher's account, you also get access to the teacher's manual with information on how to teach
and frequently made mistakes.</p>

<p dir="auto">OpenHaystack is an application that allows you to create your own accessories that are tracked by Apple's <a href="#how-does-apples-find-my-network-work">Find My network</a>. All you need is a Mac and a <a href="https://microbit.org/" rel="nofollow">BBC micro:bit</a> or any <a href="#how-to-track-other-bluetooth-devices">other Bluetooth-capable device</a>.
By using the app, you can track your accessories anywhere on earth without cellular coverage. Nearby iPhones will discover your accessories and upload their location to Apple's servers when they have a network connection.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">History</h3><a id="user-content-history" aria-label="Permalink: History" href="#history"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">OpenHaystack is the result of reverse-engineering and security analysis work of Apple's <em>Find My network</em> (or <em>offline finding</em>). We at the <a href="https://seemoo.de/" rel="nofollow">Secure Mobile Networking Lab</a> of TU Darmstadt started analyzing offline finding after its initial announcement in June 2019. We identified how Apple devices can be found by iPhones devices, even when they are offline through this work. The whole system is a clever combination of Bluetooth advertisements, public-key cryptography, and a central database of encrypted location reports. We disclosed a specification of the closed parts of offline finding and conducted a comprehensive security and privacy analysis.
We found two distinct vulnerabilities. The most severe one, which allowed a malicious application to access location data, has meanwhile been fixed by Apple (<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211849" rel="nofollow">CVE-2020-9986</a>).
For more information about the security analysis, please read <a href="#references">our paper</a>.
Since its release, we received quite a bit of <a href="https://owlink.org/press/" rel="nofollow">press and media coverage</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Disclaimer</h3><a id="user-content-disclaimer" aria-label="Permalink: Disclaimer" href="#disclaimer"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">OpenHaystack is experimental software. The code is untested and incomplete. For example, OpenHaystack accessories using our <a href="https://github.com/seemoo-lab/openhaystack/blob/main/Firmware">firmware</a> broadcast a fixed public key and, therefore, are trackable by other devices in proximity (this might change in a future release). OpenHaystack is not affiliated with or endorsed by Apple Inc.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How to use <em>OpenHaystack</em>?</h2><a id="user-content-how-to-use-openhaystack" aria-label="Permalink: How to use OpenHaystack?" href="#how-to-use-openhaystack"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">OpenHaystack consists of two components. First, we provide a <a href="https://github.com/seemoo-lab/openhaystack/blob/main/OpenHaystack">macOS application</a> that can display the last reported location of your personal Bluetooth devices. Second, the <a href="https://github.com/seemoo-lab/openhaystack/blob/main/Firmware">firmware image</a> enables Bluetooth devices to broadcast beacons that make them discoverable by iPhones.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">System requirements</h3><a id="user-content-system-requirements" aria-label="Permalink: System requirements" href="#system-requirements"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">OpenHaystack requires macOS 11 (Big Sur).</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Installation</h3><a id="user-content-installation" aria-label="Permalink: Installation" href="#installation"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The OpenHaystack application requires a custom plugin for Apple Mail. It is used to download location reports from Apple's servers via a private API (technical explanation: the plugin inherits Apple Mail's entitlements required to use this API).
Therefore, the installation procedure is slightly different and requires you to temporarily disable <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/security/gatekeeper-and-runtime-protection-sec5599b66df/1/web/1" rel="nofollow">Gatekeeper</a>.
Our plugin does not access any other private data such as emails (see <a href="https://github.com/seemoo-lab/openhaystack/blob/main/OpenHaystack/OpenHaystackMail">source code</a>).</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Download a precompiled binary release from our <a href="https://github.com/seemoo-lab/openhaystack/releases">GitHub page</a>.<br>
<em>Alternative:</em> build the application from source via Xcode.</li>
<li>Open OpenHaystack. This will ask you to install the Mail plugin in <code>~/Library/Mail/Bundle</code>.</li>
<li>Open a terminal and run <code>sudo spctl --master-disable</code>, which will disable Gatekeeper and allow our Apple Mail plugin to run.</li>
<li>Open Apple Mail. Go to <em>Preferences</em> → <em>General</em> → <em>Manage Plug-Ins...</em> and activate the checkbox next to <em>OpenHaystackMail.mailbundle</em>.
<ul dir="auto">
<li>If the <em>Manage Plug-Ins...</em> button does not appear. Run this command in terminal <code>sudo defaults write "/Library/Preferences/com.apple.mail" EnableBundles 1</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Allow access and restart Mail.</li>
<li>Open a terminal and enter <code>sudo spctl --master-enable</code>, which will enable Gatekeeper again.</li>
</ol>

<p dir="auto"><strong>Adding a new accessory.</strong>
To create a new accessory, you just need to enter a name for it and optionally select a suitable icon and a color. The app then generates a new key pair that is used to encrypt and decrypt the location reports. The private key is stored in your Mac's keychain.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Deploy to device.</strong>
Connect a <a href="#how-to-track-other-bluetooth-devices">supported device</a> via USB to your Mac and hit the <em>Deploy</em> button next to the accessory's name and choose the corresponding.
Instead of using OpenHaystack's integrated deployment, you may also copy the public key used for advertising (right click on accessory) and deploy it manually.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Display devices' locations.</strong>
It can take up to 30 minutes until you will see the first location report on the map on the right side. The map will always show all your items' most recent locations. You can click on every item to check when the last update was received.
By clicking the reload button, you can update the location reports.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How does Apple's Find My network work?</h2><a id="user-content-how-does-apples-find-my-network-work" aria-label="Permalink: How does Apple's Find My network work?" href="#how-does-apples-find-my-network-work"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">We briefly explain Apple's offline finding system (aka <a href="https://developer.apple.com/find-my/" rel="nofollow"><em>Find My network</em></a>). Please refer to our <a href="#references">PETS paper and Apple's accessory specification</a> for more details. We provide a schematic overview (from our paper) and explain how we integrate the different steps in OpenHaystack below.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/seemoo-lab/openhaystack/blob/main/Resources/FindMyOverview.png"><img src="https://github.com/seemoo-lab/openhaystack/raw/main/Resources/FindMyOverview.png" alt="Find My Overview"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Pairing (1)</h3><a id="user-content-pairing-1" aria-label="Permalink: Pairing (1)" href="#pairing-1"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">To use Apple's Find My network, we generate a public-private key pair on an elliptic curve (P-224). The private key remains on the Mac securely stored in the keychain, and the public key is deployed on the accessory, e.g., an attached micro:bit.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Losing (2)</h3><a id="user-content-losing-2" aria-label="Permalink: Losing (2)" href="#losing-2"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">In short, the accessories broadcast the public key as Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) advertisements (see <a href="https://github.com/seemoo-lab/openhaystack/blob/main/Firmware">firmware</a>).
Nearby iPhones will not be able to distinguish our accessories from a genuine Apple device or certified accessory.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Finding (3)</h3><a id="user-content-finding-3" aria-label="Permalink: Finding (3)" href="#finding-3"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">When a nearby iPhone receives a BLE advertisement, the iPhone fetches its current location via GPS, encrypts it using public key from the advertisement, and uploads the encrypted report to Apple's server.
All iPhones on iOS 13 or newer do this by default. OpenHaystack is not involved in this step.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Searching (4)</h3><a id="user-content-searching-4" aria-label="Permalink: Searching (4)" href="#searching-4"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Apple does not know which encrypted locations belong to which Apple account or device. Therefore, every Apple user can download any location report as long as they know the corresponding public key. This is not a security issue: all reports are end-to-end encrypted and cannot be decrypted unless one knows the corresponding private key (stored in the keychain). We leverage this feature to download the reports from Apple that have been created for our OpenHaystack accessories. We use our private keys to decrypt the location reports and show the most recent one on the map.</p>

We use our Apple Mail plugin, which runs with elevated privileges, to access the required authentication information. The OpenHaystack app communicates with the plugin while downloading reports. This is why you need to keep Mail open while using OpenHaystack.</p>

<p dir="auto">In principle, any Bluetooth device can be turned into an OpenHaystack accessory that is trackable via Apple's Find My network.
Currently, we provide a convenient deployment method of our OpenHaystack firmwares for a small number of embedded devices (see table below). We also support Linux devices via our generic HCI script.
Feel free to port OpenHaystack to other devices that support Bluetooth Low Energy based on the <a href="https://github.com/seemoo-lab/openhaystack/blob/main/Firmware">source code of our firmware</a> and the specification in <a href="#references">our paper</a>. Please share your results with us!</p>

<p dir="auto">OpenHaystack Mobile is a complete reimplementation of the OpenHaystack macOS application for smartphones. The app provides the same functionality to create and track accessories and aims to increase the usability, especially for new users. In contrast to the macOS application, the location reports cannot be fetched directly on the smartphone, so the app requires a proxy server hosted on Mac hardware to access the Find My network. The proxy server can be accessed over a network by multiple users simultaneously.</p>
<p dir="auto">To connect to your proxy server set the correct URL in: openhaystack-mobile/lib/findMy/reports_fetcher.dart</p>

<p dir="auto">OpenHaystack Mobile is built with the cross-platform <a href="https://flutter.dev/" rel="nofollow">Flutter framework</a> and currently runs on Android and iOS. More information about the app and usage instructions can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/seemoo-lab/openhaystack/blob/main/openhaystack-mobile">openhaystack-mobile</a> folder of this repository.</p>

Here’s a personal memoir, with a few lessons in taking memorable snapshots.</em></p><figure></figure><p id="6280">My father was an avid amateur photographer. He loved to take pictures, he invested in expensive cameras, and I’ve plenty of vacation memories where he had one of those cameras in hand.</p><p id="3da3">But organizing the slides afterwards? Labeling them? No way. Pop threw the boxes of slides in big piles and said, “I’ll sort them after I retire.” And, in preparation for his retirement, he put all those slides into five huge boxes — the kind you’d use to ship vinyl records.</p><p id="da0f">Whereupon, three days after my father formally retired in 1988, he died in his sleep.</p><p id="54ec">The slides stayed with my mother. When she moved into assisted living, the boxes went into my sister’s garage. After mom died, three years ago, they came to me. The result was a huge project of scanning family slides — between 8,000 and 10,000 of them.</p><p id="326c">The primary goal was to save the photos before the media deteriorated beyond hope. It was too late in some cases. I remember Pop telling me how much cheaper Ektachrome was (compared to Kodachrome), but many of those images were as ghost-like as a half-remembered dream. Memories fade even faster. Is that a photo of my second cousin Charlotte? I’ve no idea.</p><p id="74e2">For those who want practical lessons, herein you will find two categories:</p><ul><li id="fa6a">How to go about a family photo archive project (or at least how I did it) and</li><li id="8730">Practical suggestions for taking photos that your family will treasure long after you’re gone.</li></ul><p id="412f">This was an oddly spiritual process. We take pictures of the moments we think are valuable or important. So, in the photos he took, I saw my father’s dreams, the things he thought were beautiful, his moments of pride. And in so doing, I gained more understanding of who my parents were. …but I’ll leave that essay to another time.</p><h2 id="1618">Logistics and project scope</h2><p id="03ea">I have spoken with several people who have similar family photo archives, so let me begin by describing I went about the project.</p><p id="4243">Before I began, I had an inexpensive <a href="http://amzn.to/2BzhIkw" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Wolverine slide scanner</a> but I knew a manual unit would not cut it. I bought a heavy-duty slide scanner to help me process the images. It’s a <a href="http://amzn.to/2u4f8Ee" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Canon CanoScan 9000F</a>. I like it, in case you’re shopping for an affordable unit; in particular, I do not loathe the built-in software, which sets it apart from other scanners I’ve used.</p><p id="c5f5">The project, which took me about a year, became a background process. I could scan a box of slides while I was reading my daily morning e-mail, then clean up and share the images during moments of down-time (such as waiting for poky websites to load site statistics). Over a weekend I usually could get through five or six boxes of slides.</p><p id="2d7d">Scanning a box of slides had several steps, each of which became a kind of emotional triage:</p><ul><li id="8ec0">I held up a slide (in front of a desk lamp) to identify it generally and decide if it was worth scanning. In other words: Do I care about this at all? Something out-of-focus easily could be thrown away. A picture of people I didn’t care about (e.g. someone my folks met on a bus tour and never spoke with again) could be dumped, too. It soon became obvious that I didn’t need to scan tourist photos; there are just-so-many pictures you need to see of the Tower of London (which looks the same today as it did in 1972 when my parents visited) or random sunsets over random mountains.</li><li id="551b">If the slide looked interesting, I did a fast preview scan. For instance, if my father took three pictures “just to be sure” I could choose the best image; I could throw out the ones where my brother had his eyes closed. And I could eliminate the pictures that were inherently uninteresting, by which I mean it brought me no sense of nostalgia.</li><li id="af41">By the time I scanned an image, I was pretty committed to keeping it and sharing it with my siblings. Sometimes, if an image was entertaining or meaningful, I’d share it among my friends on Facebook.</li></ul><p id="f7db">From a box of 24–36 slides, I usually shared about 8 with my brother and sisters. By the end of the project, I’d shared 2,800 images with my siblings, and a few hundred on Facebook.</p><p id="1933">I used iPhoto to clean up the images and sort them into a dedicated folder. While tools like PhotoShop certainly could do a better job (and were trotted out for a few special images), 98% were treated with iPhoto’s crop, straighten, and the “Enhance” button. I also added dates and locations to the images’ metadata.</p><p id="29cb">To share the images with my family, I uploaded photos to Flickr. Other photo sharing sites have far better user interfaces, but Flickr has two advantages: I can limit sharing to a set of people marked as friends-and-family, and viewers can comment on the images. Plus you can search images, if you’re smart enough to add tags as you go. (Do.)</p><p id="9e59">Towards the end I also created private Facebook groups, which let me share with cousins as well as siblings, though its search capabilities are poor. It’s been useful for sharing those videos, though, and for encouraging conversations among my relatives.</p><p id="db0d">For general sharing online, I created an Old Family Photos album on Facebook. iPhoto makes it easy to share to an album (though, alas, not to a private group). I’ve been astonished by how many of my family’s history touches a chord. Don’t be shy; but do keep your family’s privacy sensitivities in mind when you share.</p><h2 id="075f">A lifetime in five boxes</h2><p id="d606">The earliest roll of slides was from my parents’ engagement party circa 1941, followed by their honeymoon snapshots in 1942. Thousands of slides record their lives all the way through the 1980s, with a Family Circle gathering held only two months before my father’s death.</p><figure><figcaption><em>My mother at her engagement party, 1941, with her mother and my father’s stepmother</em></figcaption></figure><p id="b86f">Inside the big boxes were two shoeboxes with a hundred 8mm video movies, which went back to the 1920s but mainly record 1950s camping trips. (<a href="https://www.imemories.com/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">iMemories</a> did a very good job at digitizing those.)</p><p id="2aa3">Most images are from family vacations and special occasions, rather than “daily life.” Earlier vacations (1950s and 1960s) are mostly camping trips; later pictures are from trips to Europe, particularly when money eased up after “the kids left home.”</p><p id="d0ad">But more is visible than the campsites and Boy Scout trips. I saw a young couple’s struggles to cope with three young children (I was an afterthought); I watched their idealism diminish and exhaustion set in.</p><h2 id="72cc">Take pictures of interactions, and other lessons</h2><p id="480c">I threw away many thousands of pictures. Some of them undoubtedly had meaning to my parents, but nobody alive cares about those photos. Yet I also came across special moments — and none of us need to have “been there” to appreciate them.</p><p id="6992">In reviewing thousands of slides, I learned quite a bit about taking photos that capture a family’s life. Perhaps these lessons can help you, too, in considering which images to snap — on vacation or in daily life.</p><p id="844e"><strong>Those “title slides” are meaningful after all</strong>. I remember rolling my eyes whenever my father would station me in front of a road sign or National Park entrance. Such pictures seemed really lame.</p><p id="331f">As I reviewed the pictures, though, the title slides were priceless. In all those years, my parents went to dozens of beaches, gardens, and campsites in random mountain ranges. Other than the date on the slide (“Sep 83”) I have no way to identify which one it is. (Occasionally, there’s a scribbled note, like, “Explorer Trip” or “London.” Um, thanks, Pop.)</p><p id="aa29">So I was always glad when I found a photo of us kids standing next to a “Mystic Seaport” sign or “Underground tours” (always looking put-upon and sullen, because we were told to “Stand up straight! And smile — it might turn out good!”).</p><figure><figcaption><em>1963, in… well, see, we can tell!</em></figcaption></figure><p id="b085">Labels matter. Even a few words helped me know when-and-where something happened: “1955 Nova Scotia” or my grandfather’s name. One of the saddest experiences was looking at a family-gathering photo from the 50s with several people in it, and having no idea who’s in it. (Is that my great-aunt? Maybe my sister remembers? …and too often she didn’t.) If you inherit the photos, take the time to identify the people in them. Even if it’s obvious to you that the picture is of cousin Janet who died in 1943, you can’t assume that the next viewer will know.</p><figure><figcaption>Coin operated gas station, 1966</figcaption></figure><p id="111d"><em>Lesson</em>: Do take pictures that give the viewer a clue of where you are, and with whom.</p><p id="2274"><strong>Kodak picture spots aren’t memorable</strong>. Destination pictures surely remind the travelers of their experience. I’m sure that that picture of the beach in Portugal would have encouraged my father to say, “Thelma, remember that night?” That’s fine, for the people who participated. I’ve taken thousands of such photos myself.</p><p id="dd5c">But if I wasn’t there, the image brings me no nostalgia.</p><p id="8423">The worst of these pictures are the touristy photos. My father took plenty of pictures of the Eiffel Tower on their trip in the 70s. But the tower doesn’t look any different today, so I didn’t bother to scan those photos. In fact, I dumped boxes without even looking at the contents, because there’s nothing in that experience that speaks to anyone but the participants.</p><p id="b8ed"><em>Lesson</em>: It’s fine to take pictures that capture a moment for those who were present. But if <em>anyone</em> could have taken that photo, don’t expect anyone to care.</p><p id="1c7c"><strong>People pictures matter the most</strong>. Especially the non-staged ones. The formal pictures of special occasions, where we kids are lined up like we’re in front of a firing squad, are not the ones that bind us.</p><p id="3c15">The best family photos are the ones where we’re clowning around and laughing, or where we’re doing something together, or a moment captured without the subject realizing it. The most precious are those where the family is putting up a pup tent, or using the water pump, or packing the car for a trip.</p><figure><figcaption><em>Hanging up the kittens</em></figcaption></figure><p id="45e4">In general, try to capture your family when they are actively doing something, ideally an entire process. Let it be a photo essay: “Mom making Thanksgiving dinner” or “Daddy taking the kids to the petting zoo.” Don’t choose only the “reveal” moments such as Mom presenting the turkey to the table; include a picture of her hurriedly putting on lipstick before Grandpa arrives, or the kids conked out, asleep in the back seat, on the car trip home.</p><p id="4269">A few exceptions: Nobody looks attractive or interesting while he’s swimming. Few people look great sitting on a towel on the beach, wearing a bathing cap. Also don’t take pictures of people eating dinner, even at a fancy dinner. And while it’s no longer relevant, it was never a good idea to photograph exhausted travelers arriving at an airport gate.</p><figure><figcaption>Playing Mousetrap at home, 1964</figcaption></figure><p id="de29">Include the photographer. I have few pictures of my father, because he was always the guy behind the camera. When he did ask someone to take a picture it was always posed, such as “Mom and Pop standing in front of the Grand Canyon.”</p><p id="4651"><em>Lesson</em>: Photos that capture you “being there” — which means most selfies — rarely have meaning. <em>Doing</em> matters far more.</p><p id="6cc6"><strong>Take photos of daily life</strong>. I’m stunned by the pictures my father <em>didn’t</em> take. There isn’t a single photo that represents what my parents did for a living. They weren’t the type to attend company picnics, fine. But I found nothing indicating “take your daughter to work” or “Mom typing up a report” or “the building I worked in” or “the woman Mom commuted to work with for 10 years.” That would be more understandable if my parents disliked their jobs, but both of them were passionate about their careers.</p><p id="fe60">Take photos of people at rest. Even though I spent much of my childhood writing letters, there is only one photo of me with a pen in my hand — and that was taken by a friend at summer camp. Yet my friends and family all recall me with a book or pen within reach. My father never captured that essential part of who I was.</p><figure><figcaption>Your proprietor writing letters, 1973</figcaption></figure><p id="4c25">Some of the absences may reflect their superstitions. There are zero photos of any woman who is visibly pregnant. Maybe that was considered bad luck; I don’t know.</p><p id="e25b"><em>Lesson</em>: Don’t limit photo-taking to special occasions.</p><p id="b383"><strong>Take at least a short class in photography basics</strong>. Or read a basic book on the topic. As much as my father loved photography, he never got any kind of formal training. I spend a lot of editing time cropping images to take advantage of the simplest rule-of-thirds, for instance.</p><p id="b4ba">Even if you aren’t devoted to photography that much: Crop photos closely. My father took a lot of photos of “Mom in front of a pretty vista” but in the long run I care more about Mom’s expression than the expanse of mountains in the background. Thanks to iPhoto I can zoom in, but a lot of detail is lost.</p><p id="83c6"><em>Lesson</em>: Take the best quality photos you can. Your grandchildren will appreciate it.</p></div><div><p id="cd37">Ultimately, we all take family photos to help ourselves remember the moments we want to recall forever. Nothing suggests that those memories must last beyond our own lifetimes. But if you want your children’s children to recall who you are-and-were, these tips might help you achieve that.</p></div></div>]]></description>

 <p>After multiple attempts to get the perfect shot, Concorde had to reduce its speed from Mach 2 to Mach 1.5-1.6 to allow the Tornado crew to position themselves.</p> <p>Once in position, the Tornado crew managed to capture the photo but could only maintain formation for about four minutes before breaking off, as their fuel reserves rapidly dwindled. Meanwhile, the Concorde continued its effortless cruise toward New York’s JFK Airport. </p> <h2>One-of-a-Kind Airplane</h2> <p>Concorde was a marvel of aviation. On February 7, 1996, it completed its fastest transatlantic crossing, flying from New York to London in an astonishing 2 hours, 52 minutes, and 59 seconds. The supersonic jet had a maximum speed of Mach 2.04 (1,354 mph or 2,180 km/h at cruising altitude) and could carry between 92 and 128 passengers. Entering service in 1976, the Concorde remained in operation for 27 years, redefining air travel.</p> <div><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/f7cAJv0Qfr8?si=EAcjB3tmKl695NA_" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div> <p>The Concorde was jointly developed by British Aircraft Corporation (BAC) and Aérospatiale under an Anglo-French treaty. A total of 20 Concorde aircraft were built, including six prototypes and development models. Air France and British Airways were the only airlines to operate the Concorde, using it primarily for transatlantic flights between London, Paris, New York, Washington, and Barbados. These routes were completed in less than half the time of traditional airliners.</p> <p>Despite its technological brilliance, Concorde was retired in 2003. Several factors contributed to its downfall, including the tragic crash of Air France Flight 4590 in July 2000, which claimed the lives of all onboard. The downturn in commercial aviation following the September 11 attacks, combined with the ceasing of maintenance support by Airbus, ultimately grounded the supersonic icon.</p>      </div>

										<p>The recent introduction of spot bitcoin ETFs has been generating headlines and buzz in pockets of the industry. However, Vanguard does not have plans to create a Vanguard bitcoin ETF or other crypto-related products. Additionally, such products from other issuers will not be offered on our brokerage platform. In this Q&amp;A, two Vanguard leaders—Janel Jackson, global head of ETF Capital Markets and Broker &amp; Index Relations, and Andrew Kadjeski, head of Brokerage &amp; Investments—discuss why.</p>

                    <p><b>Jackson:</b> No, given the current state of crypto as an asset class, Vanguard does not have plans to launch its own bitcoin ETF or any crypto-related products. When deciding what investment products to offer, we consider a range of factors, including whether we believe they have <i>enduring</i> investment merit and meet our clients’ needs. While the discussion about bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, in general, has increased recently, we do not currently believe that there is an appropriate role for them to play in long-term portfolios. <sup>&nbsp;</sup></p>

                    <p>We do have a lot of interest in blockchain, the technology behind cryptocurrencies. We believe its application to a number of other uses besides crypto will make capital markets more efficient, and we’ve been actively involved in research to use blockchain technology.&nbsp;<br>

                </div>

        <div>
                <h5><p>Why is Vanguard not offering crypto-related products on its brokerage platform?<sup>1</sup></p>
</h5>
            </div>
        

        <div>
                    	<p><a name="OLE_LINK10" id="OLE_LINK10"></a><b>Kadjeski:</b> Investors have a lot of choices these days when it comes to where to save for their retirement, invest for their kids’ education, and hold their emergency savings. Investors who come directly to Vanguard do so because they know we put their interests first<a name="OLE_LINK6" id="OLE_LINK6"></a>—and that is reflected in what products and services we <i>do</i> and <i>don’t</i> have on the shelf.</p>
<p>The easy step for us would have been just to allow full access to crypto-related products. But as a firm and a brokerage platform, we’re purposely structured to meet the needs of our investor-owners, most of whom are long-term, buy-and-hold investors.<sup>2</sup></p>
<p><b>Jackson:</b> In Vanguard’s view, crypto is more of a speculation than an investment. This is at the root of our decision to not offer crypto products, whether our own or others. With equities, you own a share of a company that produces goods or services, and many also pay dividends. With bonds, you get a stream of interest payments. Commodities are real assets that meet consumption needs, have inflation-hedging properties, and can play a <a href="https://corporate.vanguard.com/content/corporatesite/us/en/corp/articles/inflation-fighting-power-of-commodities.html" target="_self">role in certain portfolios</a>. While crypto has been classified as a commodity, it’s an immature asset class that has little history, no inherent economic value, no cash flow, and can create havoc within a portfolio.</p>
<p>Morningstar recently published a perceptive article pointing out that even a modest 5% allocation to bitcoin in an otherwise traditional balanced portfolio can drastically raise its risk profile.<sup>3</sup> This is driven, in large part, by bitcoin’s extreme volatility.</p>
<p><b>Kadjeski:</b> Over just the past three years, the price of bitcoin has increased by as much as 150% and declined by as much as 77%. Double-digit percent price drops are routine among cryptocurrencies. Remember that you need a 100% return just to make up for a 50% decline. And the more volatile an asset, the more tempting it is to trade. At Vanguard, our products and services are designed with the goal to help investors save more, trade less, and take a long-term approach—not chase trends and churn their portfolios.</p>

               		</div>

        
    </div>

<div>

        <div>
                <h5><p>Has Vanguard made similar decisions in the past?</p>
</h5>
            </div>
        

        <div>
                    	<p><b>Jackson:</b> There have been several investment trends in the past—the internet funds in the late 1990s for example—that Vanguard could have capitalized on. But we always ask ourselves, “Does this meet our investors’ long-term needs?” In hindsight, in nearly all cases, I believe we made the right call, ultimately benefiting our clients.<b></b></p>
<p><b>Kadjeski:</b> The same line of thinking applies to our brokerage platform. In 2019, we decided to remove access to leveraged and inverse funds and ETFs. These products are often misunderstood and misused by investors and can magnify losses. Similarly, in 2022, we stopped offering most over-the-counter stocks, which are prone to high risk, low liquidity, and potential fraud.</p>
<p><b>Jackson:</b> We understand that our decision on crypto is not popular among some investors, but many know that we’re being consistent with our philosophy and past practice.<sup>4 </sup>Our mission statement to give investors the best chance for investment success isn’t just a saying for us. It’s built into our DNA and we’re staying true to our mission by making this decision.&nbsp;</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>OpenJazz is a free, open-source version of the classic Jazz Jackrabbit™ games.
     OpenJazz can be compiled on a wide range of operating systems, including Windows
     98/Me/XP and Linux.
     To play, you will need the files from one of the original games.
     </p><p>With the demise of DOS-based operating systems, it became necessary
     to use emulators to play old DOS games.
     Jazz Jackrabbit™ deserves more - and would benefit greatly from new features.
     </p><p>OpenJazz was started on the 23rd of August, 2005, by <a href="https://alister.eu/">AJ Thomson</a>.
     Academic pressures put the project on hold until late December 2005. The
     source code was released on the 25th, and the first version with a degree of playability
     was released on the 15th of January. Since then, a variety of ports have been released
     by other people.
     </p><p>In 2009, a multiplayer version was released.</p></div></div>]]></description>

Here’s what you can expect from this release:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Opensource Models:</strong> We’re releasing two new checkpoints, <strong>Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-1M</strong> and <strong>Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct-1M</strong>, marking the first time we’ve upgraded our opensource Qwen models to handle 1M-token contexts.</p></li><li><p><strong>Inference Framework:</strong> To help developers deploy the Qwen2.5-1M series models more efficiently, we’ve fully open-sourced our inference framework based on <a href="https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm">vLLM</a>. With integration with sparse attention methods, our framework can process 1M-token inputs <strong>3x to 7x</strong> faster.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen2.5-1M/Qwen2_5_1M_Technical_Report.pdf">Technical Report</a>:</strong> We’re also sharing the technical details behind the Qwen2.5-1M series, including design insights for training and inference frameworks, as well as ablation experiments.</p></li></ol><p>You can experience Qwen2.5-1M models online by visiting our demo on <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/Qwen/Qwen2.5-1M-Demo">Huggingface</a> and <a href="https://www.modelscope.cn/studios/Qwen/Qwen2.5-1M-Demo">Modelscope</a>.</p><p>Additionally, we recently introduced <strong><a href="https://chat.qwenlm.ai/">Qwen Chat</a></strong>, an advanced AI assistant from the Qwen series. With Qwen Chat, you can engage in conversations, write code, perform searches, generate images and videos, and utilize various tools. Notably, Qwen Chat also features the Qwen2.5-Turbo model, which supports long-context processing with a context length of up to 1M tokens.</p><h2 id="model-performance">Model Performance</h2><p>Let’s start by diving into the performance of the Qwen2.5-1M series models, covering both long-context and short text tasks.</p><h2 id="long-context-tasks">Long-Context Tasks</h2><p>First off, we evaluate the Qwen2.5-1M models on the Passkey Retrieval task with a context length of 1 million tokens. The results show that these models can accurately retrieve hidden information from documents containing up to 1M tokens, with only minor errors observed in the 7B model.</p><figure><img src="https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen2.5-1M/passkey_retrieval.png#center" width="100%"></figure><p>For more complex long-context understanding tasks, we select <a href="https://github.com/hsiehjackson/RULER">RULER</a>, <a href="https://github.com/infinigence/LVEval">LV-Eval</a>, <a href="https://github.com/THUDM/LongAlign">LongbenchChat</a> used in <a href="https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen2.5-turbo/#more-complex-long-text-tasks">this blog</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen2.5-1M/ruler.png#center" width="80%"></figure><figure><img src="https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen2.5-1M/lv-eval.png#center" width="80%"></figure><p>From these results, we can draw a few key conclusions:</p><ul><li><strong>Significantly Superior to the 128k Version:</strong> The Qwen2.5-1M series models significantly outperform their 128K counterparts in most long-context tasks, especially for sequences exceeding 64K in length.</li><li><strong>Notable Performance Advantage:</strong> The Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct-1M model not only beats Qwen2.5-Turbo but also consistently outperforms GPT-4o-mini across multiple datasets, offering a robust open-source alternative for long-context tasks.</li></ul><h2 id="short-context-tasks">Short-Context Tasks</h2><p>Besides performance on long sequences, we’re equally interested in how these models handle short sequences. So, we compare the Qwen2.5-1M models and their 128K versions on widely used academic benchmarks, throwing in GPT-4o-mini for comparison.</p><figure><img src="https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen2.5-1M/short_result.png#center" width="80%"></figure><p>Here’s what we find:</p><ul><li>Both Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-1M and Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct-1M maintain performance on short text tasks that is similar to their 128K versions, ensuring the fundamental capabilities haven’t been compromised by the addition of long-sequence processing abilities.</li><li>Compared to GPT-4o-mini, both Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct-1M and Qwen2.5-Turbo achieve similar performance on short text tasks while supporting a context length that’s eight times longer.</li></ul><h2 id="key-techniques">Key Techniques</h2><p>Here, we’ll briefly introduce the key techniques behind building Qwen2.5-1M. For more details, please check out our <a href="https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen2.5-1M/Qwen2_5_1M_Technical_Report.pdf">technical report</a>.</p><h2 id="long-context-training">Long-Context Training</h2><figure><img src="https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen2.5-1M/training_stages.png#center" width="70%"></figure><p>Training with long sequences demands substantial computational resources, so we adopt a progressive approach to expand the context length for Qwen2.5-1M through multiple stages:</p><ul><li>We begin with an intermediate checkpoint of pre-trained Qwen2.5, which had a 4K token context length.</li><li><strong>In Pretraining</strong>, we gradually increase the context length from 4K to 256K tokens while using <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16039">Adjusted Base Frequency</a>, raising the RoPE base from 10,000 to 10,000,000.</li><li><strong>In Supervised Fine-tuning</strong>, we split this into two stages to preserve performance on shorter sequences:<ul><li><strong>Stage 1:</strong> Fine-tuned only on short instructions (up to 32K tokens) using the same data and steps as the 128K versions of Qwen2.5.</li><li><strong>Stage 2:</strong> Mixed short (up to 32K) and long (up to 256K) instructions to enhance long-context task performance while maintaining short-task quality.</li></ul></li><li><strong>In Reinforcement Learning</strong>, we train models on short texts up to 8K tokens, which sufficiently improves alignment with human preferences and generalizes well to long-context tasks.</li></ul><p>The final instruction-tuned models are capable of handling sequences up to 256K tokens.</p><p>During training, we develop an instruction-tuned model with a context length of 256K tokens. To extend this to 1M tokens, we employ length extrapolation techniques.</p><p>The degradation of LLMs based on RoPE in long-context tasks is mainly due to unseen, large relative positional distances between queries and keys in computing attention weight. We employ <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17463"><strong>Dual Chunk Attention</strong></a> (DCA), which addresses this issue by remapping relative positions to smaller values, avoiding the large distances not seen during training.</p><figure><img src="https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen2.5-1M/dca.png#center" width="70%"></figure><p>We evaluat the Qwen2.5-1M models and their 128K counterparts with and without the length extrapolation method. We can find:</p><p>Even models trained on just 32K tokens, such as the Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, achieve nearly perfect accuracy in passkey retrieval tasks with 1M-token contexts. This underscores the remarkable ability of DCA to extend supported context lengths, without any training required.</p><figure><img src="https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen2.5-1M/dca_ablation.png#center" width="40%"></figure><h2 id="sparse-attention">Sparse Attention</h2><p>For long-context language models, inference speed is crucial for user experience. We introduce a sparse attention mechanism based on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02490"><strong>MInference</strong></a> to accelerate the prefill phase. Furthermore, we propose several improvements:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Integrating with Chunked Prefill:</strong> Directly processing sequences of 1M tokens results in substantial memory overhead to store the activations in MLP layers, consuming 71GB of VRAM in Qwen2.5-7B. By integrating with chunk prefill with a chunk length of 32,768 tokens, activation VRAM usage is reduced by 96.7%, leading to a significant decrease in memory consumption.</p></li><li><p><strong>Integrating with Length Extrapolation:</strong> We integrate DCA with MInference in long-context processing, thereby enhancing inference efficiency and achieving greater accuracy.</p></li><li><p><strong>Sparsity Refinement on Long Sequences:</strong> MInference requires an offline search to determine the optimal sparsification configuration for each attention head. Due to the computational demand of full attention weights, this search is typically conducted on short sequences, which may not generalize well to longer sequences. We developed a method to refine the sparsification configuration specifically for sequences up to 1M tokens, which significantly reduces the accuracy loss brought by sparse attention.</p></li><li><p><strong>More Optimizations:</strong> We introduce additional optimizations, such as enhanced kernel efficiency and dynamic chunked pipeline parallelism, to fully unlock the potential of the entire framework.</p></li></ul><p>With these enhancements, our inference framework results in a 3.2x to 6.7x acceleration in the prefill speed across different model sizes and GPU devices for sequences of 1M token length.</p><figure><img src="https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen2.5-1M/speed.png#center" width="85%"></figure><h2 id="deploy-qwen25-1m-models-locally">Deploy Qwen2.5-1M Models Locally</h2><p>Here we provide step-by-step instructions for deploying the Qwen2.5-1M models on your local devices.</p><h3 id="1-system-preparation">1.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>Date: 2025-01-26 <br>
Git: <a href="https://gitlab.com/mort96/blog/blob/published/content/00000-home/00016-wayland-input-latency.md">https://gitlab.com/mort96/blog/blob/published/content/00000-home/00016-wayland-input-latency.md</a></p>
<p>Yesterday, I read this blog post:
<a href="https://gist.github.com/generic-internet-user/e8eec46ce159571032115f6fb064523c">Wayland Cursor Lag: Just give me a break already...</a>,
where a Linux user discusses their frustration with input latency under Wayland.
They detailed their own subjective experience of the problem,
but failed to produce hard evidence.</p>
<p>Even though I'm a very happy user of wayland overall,
I share the blog post's author's subjective impression that there's more
cursor lag under Wayland than under X11.
In my opinion, their experiment was limited by their phone camera's 90 FPS,
which really doesn't feel like it's enough to get conclusive numbers
when we're talking about differences which are probably on the order of
single screen refresh cycles.</p>
<p>So I thought: hey, I have a phone with a 240 FPS camera mode,
I bet that's enough to get some conclusive results!</p>
<p>Spoilers: I was right.</p>
<h2>Experimental design</h2>
<p>I simply pointed my phone's camera at the screen and desk using my left hand,
made sure to get the mouse cursor, the mouse and my right hand in frame,
and recorded myself repeatedly flicking the mouse with my finger.
I recorded myself flicking it 16 times under Wayland,
logged out of the GNOME Wayland session and into a GNOME X11 session,
then did the same there.</p>
<p>I then converted the two resulting video files into a series of JPEGs
using ffmpeg (<code>ffmpeg -i &lt;input file&gt; %04d.jpg</code>),
and counted from the first frame where I could see the mouse move
until the first frame where I could clearly see that the cursor had moved.</p>
<p>I elected to include the start and end frame;
so if I saw the mouse move in frame 1045,
then I saw the cursor move in frame 1047,
I would count that as 3 frames.</p>
<p>Here's an example which depicts a latency of 3 frames (requires JavaScript):</p>
<div>
<div>
<p><img src="https://mort.coffee/_/imgs/wayland-latency-before-1.jpg" alt="before 1"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here's a frame from before the mouse has begun moving.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div>
<p><img src="https://mort.coffee/_/imgs/wayland-latency-before-2.jpg" alt="before 2"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The mouse still hasn't moved.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div>
<p><img src="https://mort.coffee/_/imgs/wayland-latency-moved-1.jpg" alt="mouse moving"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here, the mouse has just about started moving,
so I consider this "frame 1".
The cursor hasn't moved yet.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div>
<p><img src="https://mort.coffee/_/imgs/wayland-latency-moved-2.jpg" alt="still moving"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The mouse moves a bit further, but the cursor still hasn't moved.
This is "frame 2".</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div>
<p><img src="https://mort.coffee/_/imgs/wayland-latency-cursor.jpg" alt="cursor moved"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is the frame where the cursor starts moving.
This is "frame 3", so I would note down this sequence
as taking 3 frames.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
</div>
<p>Hardware details:</p>
<ul>
<li>Distro: Fedora Workstation 41</li>
<li>GNOME version: 47</li>
<li>CPU: AMD Ryzen 9 5950X</li>
<li>GPU: AMD Radeon RX 7900XT</li>
<li>Monitor: Gigabyte M32U (4k IPS @ 144.99, no DPI scaling)</li>
<li>Mouse: Logitech G502 Lightspeed</li>
<li>Camera: iPhone 15 Pro, slo-mo 240 FPS</li>
</ul>
<h2>Limitations</h2>
<p>The main limitations of this experiment are:</p>
<ul>
<li>240 FPS still isn't <em>that</em> much. With my 144Hz screen, I have less than
two camera frames per screen refresh. This introduces some random variance.</li>
<li>Pixels don't switch instantly, so there are ambiguous frames where the cursor
is <em>barely</em> starting to become visible in its new location.
I decided to count the cursor as "having moved" when there is a clearly visible
cursor in a new location on the screen, even if the pixels haven't fully lit up.</li>
<li>For some reason, the video recording from my phone contains some duplicate frames.
I don't know why this happens. I decided to interpret these duplicate frames
as a representation of a frame's worth of time passing, so I counted them as normal.</li>
</ul>
<p>All these factors introduce some uncertainty in the results.
However, they <em>should</em> affect Wayland and X11 equally, so with enough data,
it should all even out.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Another caveat I should clearly point out is that there are
many other Wayland compositors out there than GNOME's, and I have not tested them.
For that matter, there are other GPU drivers out there than AMD's.
Other compositors and other GPU drivers may show different results.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Here's the data I captured:</p>

<p>Wayland, on average, has roughly 6.5ms more cursor latency than X11 on my system.
I don't have the statistics expertise necessary to properly analyze
whether this difference is statistically significant or not,
but to my untrained eye, it looks like there's a clear and consistent difference.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the difference is very close to 1 full screen refresh.
I don't know whether or not that's a coincidence.</p>
<p>Here are the numbers in chart form:</p>
<p><img src="https://mort.coffee/_/imgs/wayland-latency-chart.svg" alt="Latency chart"></p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In my mind, these results are conclusive proof that there <em>is</em> a difference
in input latency between X11 and Wayland, at least with my hardware,
and that the difference is large enough that it's plausible for some people to notice.</p>
<p>Further testing on more varied hardware and refresh rates is necessary
to get a clear picture of how wide-spread the problem is and how large it is.
It's likely that the magnitude of the difference varies based on factors
such as which compositor is used and what the refresh rate of the screen is.</p>
<p>I probably won't undertake that further testing,
because this is all very time intensive work.
My goal was only to see if I could conclusively measure <em>some</em> difference.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> I want to add a note here about what this testing does <em>not</em> show.
It does not show that there's higher input latency <em>in general</em>
in Wayland compared to X11 in a way which affects, for example, games.
It is possible that this added latency is entirely cursor-specific
and that Wayland and X11 exhibit the exact same input latency
in graphical applications and games.
It is my understanding that the cursor is handled very differently from
normal graphical applications.
Further testing would be necessary to show whether Wayland has more input latency
<em>in games</em> than X11.</p>

Maybe, before trying another rollout, they might talk to a few customers, do some focus groups, even ask a few members of the press and analyst community for their advice.</p><p>But no.</p><p>Shortly after the New Year, someone in Redmond pushed a button that <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/its-official-all-your-office-apps-are-getting-ai-and-a-price-increase/">raised the price</a> of its popular (84 million paid subscribers worldwide!) Microsoft 365 product. You know, the one that used to be called Microsoft Office? Yeah, well, now the app is called Microsoft 365 Copilot, and you're going to be paying at least 30% more for that subscription starting with your next bill.</p><figure><div><picture><!----> <img src="" alt="microsoft-365-copilot-rebranding" width="740" height="870.8703703703703" fetchpriority="low"></picture></div> <figcaption><div><p>Microsoft 365 gets a new logo, a new name, and a higher price.</p></div> <span>Screenshot by Ed Bott/ZDNET</span></figcaption></figure><p>As far as I can tell, the response from customers has been overwhelmingly negative. I monitor Microsoft-focused online forums obsessively, and I read hundreds of complaints without seeing a single compliment. Seriously, the reaction to this rollout was an Excel #DIV/0 error.</p><p><strong>Also: <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/smart-home/microsoft-is-changing-the-way-you-sign-in-and-it-could-be-a-security-nightmare/">Microsoft is changing the way you sign in - and it could be a security nightmare</a></strong></p><p>What went wrong? Where do I begin?</p><h2>They botched the price increase</h2><p>Let me bend over backward to Microsoft here. They launched Office 365 (which later became Microsoft 365) more than a dozen years ago, and in that time they have not raised the price once. In case you haven't noticed, we are living through some inflationary times right now.</p><p>So, there was plenty of room for Microsoft to roll out a gentle price increase. "Hey y'all, we know this isn't welcome news but we need to bump up the Microsoft 365 subscription price by two bucks a month. It's still a great deal!"</p><p><strong>Also: <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-upgrade-your-incompatible-windows-10-pc-to-windows-11-in-2025/">How to upgrade your 'incompatible' Windows 10 PC to Windows 11 in 2025</a></strong></p><p>Netflix does that every year or two and no one shows up at Netflix HQ with pitchforks and torches.</p><p>But no. Instead, they made it a 30% price increase and <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/its-official-all-your-office-apps-are-getting-ai-and-a-price-increase/">blamed it all on artificial intelligence</a>. Bad idea. Why? Because...</p><!----><h2>No one wants to pay for AI</h2><p>There's a ton of potential in AI, and it has some solid use cases today, for tasks like <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-use-chatgpt-to-write-code-what-it-does-well-and-what-it-doesnt/">writing code</a> and finding patterns in large databases.</p><p>But in the places where Microsoft 365 Family and Personal subscribers are likely to see AI, the edges are still very, very rough. If you ask Copilot in Word to write something for you, the results will be about what you'd expect from an enthusiastic summer intern. You might fare better if you ask Copilot to turn a folder full of photos into a PowerPoint presentation. But is that task really such a challenge?</p><p><strong>Also: <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-best-ai-for-coding-in-2025-and-what-not-to-use/">The best AI for coding in 2025 (and what not to use)</a></strong></p><p>To top that off, there are similarly rough edges in the way the Copilot features are implemented. For example, I have both work and family subscriptions to Microsoft 365. This combination normally works very well; I can sign in with one account, attach resources like OneDrive from both accounts, and work with almost no friction.</p><p>But good luck doing the same with Copilot features. In that configuration, I consistently get error messages telling me, "As a Microsoft 365 Personal or Family subscriber, you'll be able to use Copilot when you're signed with your Microsoft work or school account (<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-launches-entra-a-new-identity-and-access-family-of-products/">Entra ID</a>) and Microsoft personal account. However, that ability is not yet available."</p><figure><div><picture><!----> <img src="" alt="m365-copilot-error" width="740" height="994.2798353909466" fetchpriority="low"></picture></div> <figcaption><div><p>If you pay for a personal and work subscription to Microsoft 365, you'll pay the higher price but won't get the new features.</p></div> <span>Screenshot by Ed Bott/ZDNET</span></figcaption></figure><p>Let me see if I understand this: I'm paying Microsoft for not one but two subscriptions, and they raised the price of one of those subscriptions while not allowing me to use its signature feature. That seems like a lousy way to reward your best customers.</p><h2>The announcement was bungled, too</h2><p>I pay annually for my Microsoft 365 Family subscription. The price went up more than a week ago, but I haven't received an email telling me about it. As the account manager, I should see that notice before I see the new price in my dashboard.</p><p>Instead, I learned about the new price thanks to a pop-up message on my Android phone.</p><figure><div><picture><!----> <img src="" alt="price-change-for-microsoft-365" width="740" height="1178.5185185185185" fetchpriority="low"></picture></div> <figcaption><div><p>This po-up on my phone is the only notice I've received about a price change.&nbsp;</p></div> <span>Screenshot by Ed Bott/ZDNET</span></figcaption></figure><p>That notice tells me I have a monthly plan. No, I have an annual plan that will renew in a month or two. It says I can cancel billing in my Play Store settings. No, I can't. I bought this subscription using the web browser on my Windows PC, and when I tap the Subscriptions button in the Android app it opens a web browser and takes me to my Microsoft account page, where I have to tap the Manage button to find the cancel option.</p><p>It could be worse, I suppose. Just ask the French and Spanish subscribers who got a similar pop-up message telling them their&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Office365/comments/1i75h77/microsoft_365_from_10_to_1300_a_month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">price had gone from €10 a month to €13,000</a>. (Those pesky decimals.)</p><p><strong>Also: <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/smart-home/microsoft-is-changing-the-way-you-sign-in-and-it-could-be-a-security-nightmare/">Microsoft is changing the way you sign in - and it could be a security nightmare</a></strong></p><p>Oh, and I've lost count of the number of people who were baffled and angry that Microsoft had forcibly installed the Copilot app on their devices. It was just a rebranding of the old Microsoft 365 app with the new name and logo, but in my case it was days later before I received yet another pop-up message telling me about the change.</p><h2>Well, surely you can just turn it off. Right?</h2><p>The smartest thing Microsoft could have done was to make this initial release of Copilot an opt-in feature for a few months. They could have said, "We're excited to let everyone try this! Just click OK here!"</p><p>Instead, they turned the feature on for everyone and gave Word users a well-hidden checkbox that reads Enable Copilot. The feature is on by default, so you have to clear the checkbox to make it go away.</p><p><strong>Also: <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-office-support-in-windows-10-ends-in-october-too-what-that-really-means/">Microsoft Office support in Windows 10 ends in October too - what that really means</a></strong></p><p>As for the other Office apps? "Uh, we'll get around to giving you a button to turn it off next month. Maybe."</p><p>Seriously, the&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/how-to-turn-off-copilot-in-microsoft-365-family-and-personal-subscriptions-bc7e530b-152d-4123-8e78-edc06f8b85f1" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">support page that explains where you can find that box in Word</a>&nbsp;says, "We're working on adding the Enable Copilot checkbox to Excel, OneNote, and PowerPoint on Windows devices and to Excel and PowerPoint on Mac devices. That is tentatively scheduled to happen in February 2025." Until the Enable Copilot button is available, you can't disable Copilot.</p><p>Meanwhile, maybe think twice about using the option to disable all of the connected features in your Office apps. As&nbsp;<a href="https://laurenhough.substack.com/p/there-are-some-swear-words-in-this" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">one writer pointed out</a>&nbsp;(with multiple swear words and some threats aimed in the general direction of One Microsoft Way), doing so can have unintended consequences, like making it appear as though all your files in OneDrive have suddenly disappeared.</p><h2>How long will the Classic option last?</h2><p>If you try to cancel Microsoft 365 to avoid the price increase (or just to say no to the AI features), Microsoft's subscription  management page offers the option to downgrade to a Classic plan, which turns out to be exactly what you signed up for not that long ago, minus the price increase.</p><p><strong>Also: <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-top-10-brands-exploited-in-phishing-attacks-and-how-to-protect-yourself/">The top 10 brands exploited in phishing attacks - and how to protect yourself</a></strong></p><p>That's purely a retention play, of course. New subscribers can't sign up for this plan, and I expect that it will be discontinued in a year or two.&nbsp;</p><h2>Why is Microsoft doing this?</h2><p>I have yet to see a single person praising the implementation of Copilot in Microsoft 365 or telling Satya Nadella they've gotten their money's worth out of this unexpected upgrade.</p><p>So, why do it at all? I can think of 3 billion reasons. I could plug the numbers into Excel and tell you about it, but let's have Copilot explain instead.</p><figure><div><picture><!----> <img src="" alt="microsoft-copilot-dows-math" width="1280" height="1176.167832167832" fetchpriority="low"></picture></div> <figcaption><div><p>Microsoft Copilot understands how the subscription business model works.</p></div> <span>Screenshot by Ed Bott/ZDNET</span></figcaption></figure><p>Microsoft is halfway through its 2026 fiscal year. It's almost like someone was given instructions at the end of the calendar year to bump up that revenue line for the Office Consumer division.</p><p><strong>Also: <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-i-easily-added-ai-to-my-favorite-microsoft-office-alternative/">How I easily added AI to my favorite Microsoft Office alternative</a></strong></p><p>Here's the funny thing: The price increase is so big that there will still be a huge positive impact even if 10% of Microsoft 365 Personal and Family customers cancel rather than pay the extra monthly fee. Copilot walked me through the math and concluded, "So, even with 10% of your customers canceling their subscriptions, you would still generate an additional $1.714 billion annually due to the price hike. How do you feel about this adjustment?"</p><p>I feel like I understand why all those complaints are going to go unheard.</p><div id="pinbox-684151ed-848f-4f0d-a5f9-d91e36c294b3"><h4>More Microsoft</h4> <!---->  </div></div></div>]]></description>

<img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" alt="Two caricatures of top-hatted millionaires whose bodies are bulging money-sacks. Their heads have been replaced with potatoes. The potatoes' eyes have been replaced with the hostile red eye of HAL 9000 from Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey.' They stand in a potato field filled with stoop laborers. The sky is a 'code waterfall' as seen in the credit sequences of the Wachowskis' 'Matrix' movies." src="https://i0.wp.com/craphound.com/images/big-potato.jpg?w=840&amp;ssl=1"></p>
<h2>It's not a crime if we do it with an app (<a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/01/25/potatotrac/#carbo-loading">permalink</a>)</h2>
<p>The core regulatory proposition of the tech industry is "it's not a crime if we do it with an app." It's not an unlicensed taxi if we do it with an app. It's not an illegal hotel room if we do it with an app. It's not an unregistered security if we do it with an app. It's not wage theft if we do it with an app.</p>
<p>Inflation is one of the most politically salient factors of this decade, and so much of inflation can be attributed to a crime, done with an app, with impunity for the criminals. The entire food supply has been sewn up by cartels of 2-5 giant companies, and they colluded to raise prices, and bragged about it, and got away with it, because neoclassical economists insist that it's impossible for this kind of price fixing to occur in an "efficient market."</p>
<p>Some of these cartels are well-known, like the Coke/Pepsi duopoly. Pepsi's bosses boasted to their shareholders about "Pepsi pricing power," and how they were able to raise prices over the inflationary increases caused by covid and the Russian invasion of Ukraine:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/03/11/price-over-volume/#pepsi-pricing-power">https://pluralistic.net/2023/03/11/price-over-volume/#pepsi-pricing-power</a></p>
<p>You might know that pretty much every packaged good in your grocery store is made by one of two companies, Unilever and Procter and Gamble. Both CEOs boasted to their investors about their above-inflation price increases:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/11/20/quiet-part-out-loud/#profiteering">https://pluralistic.net/2021/11/20/quiet-part-out-loud/#profiteering</a></p>
<p>But other cartels are harder to spot. It may seem like your grocer's eggs department is filled with many different companies' products. In reality, a single company, Cal-Maine Foods, owns practically every brand of eggs in the case: Farmhouse Eggs, Sunups, Sunny Meadow, Egg-Land’s Best and Land O’ Lakes. They made record profits after the pandemic and through bird flu, a fact that CFO Max Bowman attributed to "significantly higher selling prices" and "our ability to adapt to inflationary market pressures":</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/23/cant-make-an-omelet/#keep-calm-and-crack-on">https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/23/cant-make-an-omelet/#keep-calm-and-crack-on</a></p>
<p>But Cal-Maine is comparatively transparent. The other food cartels – especially those that serve the restaurant sector – are harder to spot. In <em>The Lever</em>, Katya Schwenk describes how four companies – Lamb Weston, JR Simplot, McCain Foods and Cavendish Farms – have captured the frozen potato market and all that comes with it (fries, tater tots, etc):</p>
<p><a href="https://www.levernews.com/the-rise-of-big-potato/">https://www.levernews.com/the-rise-of-big-potato/</a></p>
<p>These companies have been hiking prices for years, but <em>really</em> started to turn the screws during the post-covid inflationary period. One of Schwenk's sources is Josh Saltzman, owner of the DC sports bar Ivy and Coney. Ten years ago, Saltzman charged $3 for fries; now it's $6 – and Saltzman's margins have declined. Saltzman has a limited number of suppliers, and they all get their potatoes from Big Potato, and they bundle those potato orders with their other supplies, making it effectively impossible for Saltzman to buy his potatoes from anyone else.</p>
<p>Big Potato controls <em>97%</em> of the frozen potato market, and any sector that large and concentrated is going to be pretty cozy. The execs at these companies all meet at industry associations, lobbying bodies, and as they job-hop between companies in the cartel. But they don't have to rely on personal connections to rig the price of potatoes: they do it through a third-party data-broker called Potatotrac. Each cartel member sends all their commercially sensitive data – supply costs, pricing, sales figures – to Potatotrac, and then Potatotrac uses that data to give "advice" to the cartel members about "optimal pricing."</p>
<p>This is just price-fixing, with an app. The fact that they don't sit around a table and openly discuss pricing doesn't keep this from being price-fixing. What's more, they <em>admit it</em>. A director at McCain said that "higher ups" forbade anyone in the company from competing on price. A Lamb Weston exec described the arrangement as everyone "behaving themselves," chortling that they'd "never seen margins this high in the history of the potato industry." Lamb Weston's CEO attributed a 111% increase in net income to "pricing actions."</p>
<p>Lamb Weston's execs understand that they're driving small restaurants out of business, and that the real beneficiaries are big chains that can pass the price increases onto their customers, like "Chili’s and the Texas Roadhouses and Cheesecake Factory":</p>
<p><a href="https://app.tegus.co/guest/document/view/67Hf3DiMGQ944SkfpRhLfNeiqekjA67sm2dxTCYtjoggUaJXk2chDg9wxMnZ">https://app.tegus.co/guest/document/view/67Hf3DiMGQ944SkfpRhLfNeiqekjA67sm2dxTCYtjoggUaJXk2chDg9wxMnZ</a></p>
<p>This is by no means unique to the potato industry. A data-broker called Agri Stats works with America's largest meat-packers to rig the price of meat – packers send Agri Stats the same kind of data that Big Potato sends to Potatotrac, and Agri Stats sends back the same "recommendations" that allow them to raise meat prices across the board, in lockstep:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/10/04/dont-let-your-meat-loaf/#meaty-beaty-big-and-bouncy">https://pluralistic.net/2023/10/04/dont-let-your-meat-loaf/#meaty-beaty-big-and-bouncy</a></p>
<p>Lots of food categories are as inbred as meat and potatoes: "four firms controlled nearly 80 percent of the almond milk market, for instance. Three companies controlled 83 percent of the canned tuna market, and four companies controlled more than 86 percent of the microwave popcorn market."</p>
<p>The "price fixing is legal if we do it with an app" gambit is not just about food, either. Apps like Realpage let big corporate landlords – who've bought up a sizable fraction of all the available homes in America – collude to raise rents:</p>

<p>And private equity companies have rolled up all the <em>fire truck</em> companies, hiking the price of trucks, creating backlogs and bottlenecks for parts and service, and starving the nation's municipalities (including Los Angeles) of fire-fighting equipment:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/did-a-private-equity-fire-truck-roll">https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/did-a-private-equity-fire-truck-roll</a></p>
<p>This kind of price-fixing was central to the enforcement actions of the Biden administration's trustbusters at the FTC, and their investigations and actions inspired state AGs and private parties to bring their own antitrust suits. The question is, will Trump's enforcers continue this agenda? And will Trump's judges – steeped in Heritage Foundation economics that insists that monopolies are "efficient" – find in their favor if they do?</p>
<p>Inflation has lots of causes, it's true. But when an industry is consolidated enough to take advantage of a data brokerage or just engage in tacit collusion, <em>any</em> source of inflation – war, disease, weather – allows whole sectors to raise prices together, and keep them high, long after the shock has passed.</p>

Banks are doing really well. This made me realize that, unfortunately, </span><strong>despite almost 30 years of trying, Fintech companies have not disrupted banks</strong><span>. At least, not the big ones.</span></p><p><span>Yes, there are examples of Fintech companies challenging banks in some areas, but </span><strong>they hardly challenged the key banking model - taking deposits and issuing loans</strong><span>. Until these functions are not disrupted, we cannot talk about Fintech disrupting banks.</span></p><p><span>Perhaps, disrupting big banks takes more time or even a change in generations of consumers. Or, maybe, </span><strong>banks and Fintech companies will need to learn how to co-exist</strong><span>. In any case, I don’t think the future of the Fintech industry will be boring.</span></p><p>Jevgenijs</p><p><em><span>p.s. if you have feedback just reply to this email or ping me </span><a href="https://x.com/jevgenijs" rel="">on X/Twitter</a></em></p><p><span>Let’s talk about deposits first. </span><strong>The money center banks survived the “deposit flight”</strong><span>. JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and Citi all reported, small, but nevertheless growth in retail deposits (consumers and small businesses).

It's notable that </span><strong>we can already see that trend in consumer checking deposits</strong><span>.”</span></em></p><p><em>Jeremy Barnum, JPMorgan Q4 2024 earnings call</em></p></blockquote><p><span>The last few years seemed like </span><strong>a perfect time for Fintech companies to get deposits</strong><span>. First, stimulus money hit bank accounts, with limited ways for people to spend it. Then the Federal Reserve hiked the interest rates, so one could just park deposits in treasuries and still offer an attractive yield to depositors.</span></p><p><span>SoFi and LendingClub started offering </span><strong>high-yield savings accounts to make people move their money from the incumbents</strong><span> who paid nothing. And the incumbents couldn’t do much about it, as repricing their existing portfolio would have been far more costly than simply letting some depositors leave.</span></p><p><span>Even more exciting was Cash App teaming up with Wells Fargo (and Wise with Chase) to offer high-yield savings accounts to their customers. The message was “</span><strong>These customers want to bank with us now</strong><span>, so if you want access to their deposits, you will have to pay.” Wells Fargo and Chase needed deposits and paid 4%+ rates (without running a risk of their own customers demanding the same rate).</span></p><p><span>However…Bank of America still pays 64bps on $942 billion in deposits. Deposits are up, and the rates that the banks pay for these deposits are down. So </span><strong>for how long will Wells Fargo keep paying 4% to Cash App customers?</strong><span> Perhaps, they won’t need deposits from Cash App clients at all?</span></p><blockquote><p><em><span>“The biggest story in consumer this quarter is deposits because </span><strong>these are the most valuable deposits in the franchise</strong><span>. And in the last 6 months, we believe we've seen the floor begin to form after several periods of slowing decline. Consumer Banking deposits appear to have bottomed in mid-August at around $928 billion and ended the year at $952 billion on an ending basis.”</span></em></p><p><em>Alastair Borthwick, Bank of America Q4 2024 earnings call</em></p></blockquote><p><span>And what about LendingClub and SoFi? </span><strong>At the end of Q3 2024, LendingClub had $9.5 billion in deposits, and SoFi had $24.4 billion</strong><span>. This is impressive growth, but clearly not a disruption level. Fintech companies had a chance, and they kind of blew it.</span></p><p><span>But what’s more disappointing is that </span><strong>Fintechs haven’t managed to challenge banks in lending. </strong><span>Again, at least not the big ones. Let’s take credit card lending, which, in my opinion, is the product that should have been disrupted a long time ago.</span></p><p><span>In 2023, Affirm launched its Affirm Card. This card combines the function of a debit card with BNPL lending, and in theory, could be a challenger to traditional credit cards. </span><strong>Affirm quickly got to 1.4 million Affirm Card cardholders</strong><span>.</span></p><p><span>Robinhood also launched its Gold card last year offering 3% cash back. </span><strong>Robinhood claims that 2 million people are on the waitlist</strong><span> for this card.</span></p><blockquote><p><em><span>“Meanwhile, </span><strong>Robinhood Gold credit card crossed 2 million on the waitlist and is adding roughly 200,000 waitlist sign-ups per month</strong><span>. So at that rate, we won't have to worry about customer acquisition or credit card users for at least the next few years.”</span></em></p><p><em>Vlad Tenev, Robinhood 2024 Investor Day</em></p></blockquote><p><span>However, </span><strong>in 2024, Amex opened 13 million new card accounts, Chase opened 10 million</strong><span>, Bank of America opened 4 million, and Wells Fargo opened 2.4 million. </span></p><p><strong>JPMorgan finished 2024 with $233 billion in credit card loans</strong><span> (up from $152 billion three years ago), Citigroup with $171 billion (up from $130 billion), and Capital One with $156 billion (up from $108 billion).</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4708c86e-6b6e-42dc-9975-6f16c5728ea7_1725x1363.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4708c86e-6b6e-42dc-9975-6f16c5728ea7_1725x1363.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4708c86e-6b6e-42dc-9975-6f16c5728ea7_1725x1363.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4708c86e-6b6e-42dc-9975-6f16c5728ea7_1725x1363.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4708c86e-6b6e-42dc-9975-6f16c5728ea7_1725x1363.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4708c86e-6b6e-42dc-9975-6f16c5728ea7_1725x1363.png" width="1456" height="1150" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4708c86e-6b6e-42dc-9975-6f16c5728ea7_1725x1363.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1150,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:210761,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4708c86e-6b6e-42dc-9975-6f16c5728ea7_1725x1363.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4708c86e-6b6e-42dc-9975-6f16c5728ea7_1725x1363.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4708c86e-6b6e-42dc-9975-6f16c5728ea7_1725x1363.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4708c86e-6b6e-42dc-9975-6f16c5728ea7_1725x1363.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><blockquote><p><em><strong>We expect healthy card loan growth again this year, but below the 12% pace we saw in 2024</strong><span>, as tailwinds from revolver normalization are largely behind us.</span></em></p><p><em>Jeremy Barnum, JPMorgan Q4 2024 earnings call</em></p></blockquote><p><span>Again, the </span><strong>last few years were ideal for building a credit card business as loan balances exploded</strong><span>.
