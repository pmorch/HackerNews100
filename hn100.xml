            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/10/31/why-miebo-costs-40-times-more-than-its-european-version/">https://www.statnews.com/2025/10/31/why-miebo-costs-40-times-more-than-its-european-version/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46167557">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A month’s supply of Miebo, Bausch &amp; Lomb’s prescription dry eye drug, costs $800 or more in the U.S. before insurance. But the same drug — sold as <a href="https://ois.net/novaliq-transforming-tears/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EvoTears</a> — has been available over-the-counter (OTC) in Europe since 2015 for about $20. I ordered it online from an overseas pharmacy for $32 including shipping, and it was delivered in a week.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is, of course, both shocking and unsurprising. A 2021 RAND <a href="https://www.rand.org/news/press/2021/01/28.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study</a> found U.S. prescription drug prices are, on average, more than 2.5 times higher than in 32 other developed nations. Miebo exemplifies how some pharmaceutical companies exploit regulatory loopholes and patent protections, prioritizing profits over patients, eroding trust in health care. But there is a way to fix this loophole.</p>



<p>In December 2019, Bausch &amp; Lomb, formerly a division of Valeant, acquired the exclusive license for the commercialization and development in&nbsp;the United States&nbsp;and&nbsp;Canada&nbsp;for NOV03, now called Miebo in the U.S. Rather than getting an approval for an OTC drug, like it is in Europe, Bausch secured U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval as a prescription medication, subsequently pricing it at a high level. Currently, according to GoodRx, a monthly supply of Miebo will cost $830.27 at Walgreens, and it’s listed at $818.38 on <a href="https://pharmacy.amazon.com/dp/B0CJV1CC69" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon Pharmacy</a>.</p>



<p>The strategy has paid off: Miebo’s 2024 sales — its first full year — hit <a href="https://ir.bausch.com/sites/bauschhealth-ir/files/2025-02/4q24-bausch-lomb-earnings-presentation.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$172 million</a>, surpassing the company’s projections of $95 million. The company now forecasts sales to exceed <a href="https://www.fiercepharma.com/marketing/bausch-lomb-taps-broadcaster-erin-andrews-push-fast-growing-dry-eye-disease-drug" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$500 million annually</a>. At European prices, those sales would be less than $20 million. Emboldened with Miebo’s early success, Bausch &amp; Lomb raised the price another 4% in 2025, according to the drug price tracking firm 46brooklyn.</p>



<p>Bausch &amp; Lomb has a track record of prioritizing profits over patients. As Valeant, its business model was simple: buy, gut, gouge, repeat. In 2015, it raised prices for Nitropress and Isuprel by over <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/pharmaceutical-companies-buy-rivals-drugs-then-jack-up-the-prices-1430096431?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" rel="noopener">200% and 500%</a>, respectively, triggering a 2016 congressional hearing. Despite promises of reform, little has changed. When he was at Allergan, Bausch &amp; Lomb’s current CEO, Brent Saunders, pledged “<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/allergans-social-contract-protect-medical-innovation-from-goldberg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">responsible pricing</a>” but tried to extend patent protection for Allergan’s drug Restasis (another dry eye drug) through a <a href="https://www.statnews.com/pharmalot/2018/07/20/allergan-mohawk-patent-restasis/">dubious deal with the Mohawk Indian tribe</a>, later rejected by courts.</p>





<p>Now at Bausch &amp; Lomb, Saunders oversaw Miebo’s launch, claiming earlier this year in an investor call, “We are once again an innovation company.” But finding a way to get an existing European OTC drug to be a prescription drug in the U.S. with a new name and a 40-fold price increase is not true innovation — it’s a price-gouging strategy.</p>



<p>Bausch &amp; Lomb could have pursued OTC approval in the U.S., leveraging its expertise in OTC eye drops and lotions. However, I could not find in transcripts or presentations any evidence that Baush &amp; Lomb seriously pursued this. Prescription status, however, ensures much higher prices, protected by patents and limited competition. Even insured patients feel the ripple effects: Coupons may reduce out-of-pocket costs, but insurers pay hundreds per prescription, driving up premiums and the overall cost of health care for everyone.</p>



<p>In response to questions from STAT about why Miebo is an expensive prescription drug, a representative said in a statement, “The FDA determined that MIEBO acts at the cellular and molecular level of the eye, which meant it had to go through the same rigorous process as any new pharmaceutical — a full New Drug Application. Unlike in Europe, where all medical device eye drops are prescription-free and cleared through a highly predictable and fast pathway, we were required to design, enroll and complete extensive clinical trials involving thousands of patients, and provide detailed safety and efficacy data submissions. Those studies took years and significant investment, but they ensure that MIEBO meets the highest regulatory standards for safety and effectiveness.”</p>



<p>Bausch &amp; Lomb’s carefully worded response expertly sidesteps the real issue. The FDA’s test for OTC status isn’t a drug’s mechanism of action — it’s whether patients can use it safely without a doctor. Miebo’s track record as an OTC product in Europe for nearly a decade shows it meets that standard. Bausch &amp; Lomb provides no evidence, or even assertion, that it ever tried for OTC approval in the U.S. Instead, it pursued the prescription route — not because of regulatory necessity, but as a business strategy to secure patents and command an $800 price. In doing so, B&amp;L is weaponizing a regulatory loophole against American patients, prioritizing profit over access, and leaving their “significant investment” as the cost of monopoly, not medical necessity.</p>



<p>Even if you accept Bausch &amp; Lomb’s self-serving rationale, the answer is not to allow the loophole to persist, but to close it.&nbsp;The FDA could require any drug approved as OTC internationally be considered for OTC status in the United States before greenlighting it as a prescription product — and mandate retroactive review of cases like Miebo.</p>





<p>The FDA’s OTC monograph process, which assesses the safety and efficacy of nonprescription drugs, makes this feasible, though it may need to be adjusted slightly. Those changes might involve incorporating a mechanism to make sure that overseas OTC status triggers a review of U.S. prescription drugs containing the same active ingredients or formulations for potential OTC designation; developing criteria to assess equivalency in safety and efficacy standards between U.S. OTC requirements and those of other countries; and establishing a retroactive review pathway within the monograph process to handle existing prescription drugs already marketed OTC internationally.</p>



<p>EvoTears thrives abroad without safety concerns, countering industry claims of stricter U.S. standards. This reform would deter companies from repackaging OTC drugs as high-cost prescriptions, fostering competition and lowering prices.</p>



<p>While this tactic isn’t widespread, it joins loopholes like late-listed patents, picket fence patents, or pay-for-delay generic deals that undermine trust in an industry whose employees largely aim to save lives.</p>



<p>Miebo also shows how global reference pricing could save billions. Aligning with European prices could cut consumer costs while reducing doctor visits, pharmacy time, and administrative burdens. For patients who skip doses to afford groceries, lower prices would mean better access and health. Reforms like the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act’s Medicare price negotiations set a precedent, but targeted rules are urgently needed.</p>



<p>Unexplained differences in drug prices between the U.S. and other wealthy countries erode the public’s trust in health care. Companies like Bausch &amp; Lomb exploit systemic gaps, leaving patients and payers to foot exorbitant bills. An OTC evaluation rule, with retroactive reviews, is a practical first step, signaling that patient access takes precedence over corporate greed.</p>



<p>Let’s end the price-gouging practices of outliers and build a health care system that puts patients first. Just as targeting criminal outliers fosters a law-abiding society, holding bad pharmaceutical actors accountable is crucial for restoring trust and integrity to our health care system. While broader approaches to making health care more fair, accessible, and affordable are needed, sometimes the way to save billions is to start by saving hundreds of millions.</p>

					<h3><em>A California judge has tentatively sided with Software Freedom Conservancy in its GPL case over Vizio’s SmartCast TVs, but the final outcome of this week’s hearing is still pending.</em></h3>
<figure id="attachment_2350312" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2350312"><img decoding="async" src="https://fossforce.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/television-5017870_1280.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="451" srcset="https://fossforce.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/television-5017870_1280.jpg 700w, https://fossforce.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/television-5017870_1280-300x193.jpg 300w, https://fossforce.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/television-5017870_1280-175x113.jpg 175w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2350312">Source: Pixabay</figcaption></figure>
<p>We’re waiting to hear the final outcome of a legal case involving the GPL that harkens back to the bad “good ol’ days” of Linux and open source.</p>
<p>This case involves an action brought against Vizio — a maker of relatively low‑cost flat panel TVs — by <a href="https://fossforce.com/2016/06/oftware-freedom-conservancy-karen-sandler-foss-iot/" target="_blank">Software Freedom Conservancy</a>, which claims that the company has been in violation of the General Public License, version 2 and Lesser General Public License, version 2.1 for many years. The case centers around the company’s SmartCast TVs, which employ Linux, BusyBox, and other software licensed under GPLv2 and LGPLv2.1, without making source code available.</p>
<p>SFC’s standing in the case is as a purchaser of a Vizio smart TV and not as a copyright holder.</p>
<p><a href="https://sfconservancy.org/news/2025/dec/04/tentative-vizio-ruling-in-favor-of-sfc/" target="_blank">SFC has reported</a> that early Thursday morning Judge Sandy N. Leal of the Superior Court of California issued a tentative ruling supporting SFC’s claim that Vizio has a duty to provide SFC with the complete source code covered under open source licenses to a TV it purchased. Being tentative, the ruling isn’t final– such rulings are issued so that the parties know how the judge is leaning and can tailor their oral arguments — and it was issued before a hearing scheduled for 10 a.m. PST the same day.</p>
<p>So far there’s been no news coming out of that hearing, although we’ve reached out to SFC for a comment.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1210138&amp;u=3049832&amp;m=80177&amp;urllink=&amp;afftrack="><img decoding="async" src="https://static.shareasale.com/image/80177/18009015663533991438.jpg" alt="Premium VPS Hosting at a fraction of the cost"></a></p>
<h2>A Predictable Outcome</h2>
<p>These days the GPL and other open source licenses have been court tested enough to make the outcome in a case like this somewhat predictable: the courts will support the terms of the license. This hasn’t always been the case. For many years after the first adoption of the GPL as a free software license, and even later when the term open source came into use, it wasn’t clear whether courts would support the terms of open source licensing.</p>
<p>That began to change in the first decade of the 21st century as cases were brought against violators of open source licenses, with license terms being upheld by the courts.</p>
<p>Then in September 2007 the Software Freedom Law Center filed the first-ever US GPL enforcement lawsuit. The defendant was Monsoon Multimedia, for its Hava <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Place_shifting" target="_blank">place‑shifting devices</a> that SFLC claimed shipped with BusyBox installed without provisions for the source code.​ That case was dismissed about a month later, after Monsoon agreed to publish source code, appoint a compliance officer, notify customers of their GPL rights, and pay an undisclosed sum.​</p>
<p>Later that year, SFLC brought additional BusyBox-related GPL suits against other vendors, including Xterasys and Verizon, over failure to provide source code. Those were also settled with compliance commitments and payments.</p>
<h2>Vizio: A Goliath in Disguise</h2>
<p>In the case against Vizio, SFC is going against a company that can afford a deep pocket defense if it decides to play hardball. The Irvine, California-based company that was founded in 2002 as a designer of televisions, soundbars, and related software and accessories, was acquired by Walmart for $2.3 billion in a deal that was announced in February 2024 and closed that December.</p><p><a rel="sponsored" href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?s=4589764&amp;v=96539&amp;q=588268&amp;r=2117951">
    <img decoding="async" src="https://www.awin1.com/cshow.php?s=4589764&amp;v=96539&amp;q=588268&amp;r=2117951">
</a></p>
<p>While the acquisition was in progress, Bloomberg announced that Walmart planned to end sales of Vizio products at Amazon and Best Buy in order to turn the company into a private label brand available only at Walmart and Sam’s Club locations.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Because We're Not Smart Enough for C++ or Rust</p><div><p><img src="https://cdn.lightpanda.io/website/assets/images/blog/authors/francis-bouvier.jpg" alt="Francis Bouvier"></p><div><h3>Francis Bouvier</h3><h4>Cofounder &amp; CEO</h4></div></div><figure><img src="https://cdn.lightpanda.io/website/assets/images/blog/posts/why-we-built-lightpanda-in-zig/zigligihtpandalarge.png" alt="Why We Built Lightpanda in Zig"></figure><h2 id="tldr">TL;DR<a href="#tldr" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h2>
<p>To be honest, when I began working on Lightpanda, I chose Zig because I’m not smart enough to build a big project in C++ or Rust.</p>
<p>I like simple languages. I like Zig for the same reasons I like Go, C, and the KISS principle. Not just because I believe in this philosophy, but because I’m not capable of handling complicated abstractions at scale.</p>
<p>Before Lightpanda, I was doing a lot of Go. But building a web browser from scratch requires a low-level systems programming language to ensure great performance, so Go wasn’t an option. And for a project like this, I wanted more safety and modern tooling than C.</p>
<h2 id="why-we-built-lightpanda-in-zig">Why We Built Lightpanda in Zig<a href="#why-we-built-lightpanda-in-zig" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h2>
<p>Our requirements were performance, simplicity, and modern tooling. Zig seemed like the perfect balance: simpler than C++ and Rust, top-tier performance, and better tooling and safety than C.</p>
<p>As we built the first iterations of the browser and dug deeper into the language, we came to appreciate features where Zig particularly shines: comptime metaprogramming, explicit memory allocators, and best-in-class C interoperability. Not to mention the ongoing work on compilation times.</p>
<p>Of course it’s a big bet. Zig is a relatively new language with a small ecosystem. It’s pre-1.0 with regular breaking changes. But we’re very bullish on this language, and we’re not the only ones: <a href="https://ghostty.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Ghostty<!-- --> <svg fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="1.7" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="1em"><path d="M7 17L17 7"></path><path d="M7 7h10v10"></path></svg></a>, <a href="https://bun.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Bun<!-- --> <svg fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="1.7" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="1em"><path d="M7 17L17 7"></path><path d="M7 7h10v10"></path></svg></a>, <a href="https://tigerbeetle.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">TigerBeetle<!-- --> <svg fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="1.7" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="1em"><path d="M7 17L17 7"></path><path d="M7 7h10v10"></path></svg></a>, and <a href="https://zml.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">ZML<!-- --> <svg fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="1.7" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="1em"><path d="M7 17L17 7"></path><path d="M7 7h10v10"></path></svg></a> are all building with Zig. And with <a href="https://bun.com/blog/bun-joins-anthropic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Anthropic’s recent acquisition of Bun<!-- --> <svg fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="1.7" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="1em"><path d="M7 17L17 7"></path><path d="M7 7h10v10"></path></svg></a>, big tech is taking notice.</p>
<p>Here’s what we’ve learned.</p>
<h2 id="what-lightpanda-needs-from-a-language">What Lightpanda Needs from a Language<a href="#what-lightpanda-needs-from-a-language" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h2>
<p>Before diving into specifics, let’s talk about what building a browser for web automation requires.</p>
<p>First, we needed a JavaScript engine. Without one, a browser only sees static HTML: no client-side rendering and no dynamic content. We chose V8, Chrome’s JavaScript engine, because it’s state of the art, widely used (<a href="https://nodejs.org/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Node.js<!-- --> <svg fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="1.7" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="1em"><path d="M7 17L17 7"></path><path d="M7 7h10v10"></path></svg></a>, <a href="https://github.com/denoland/deno" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Deno<!-- --> <svg fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="1.7" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="1em"><path d="M7 17L17 7"></path><path d="M7 7h10v10"></path></svg></a>), and relatively easy to embed.</p>
<p>V8 is written in C++, and doesn’t have a C API, which means any language integrating with it must handle C++ boundaries. Zig doesn’t interoperate directly with C++, but it has first-class C interop, and C remains the lingua franca of systems programming. We use C headers generated primarily from <a href="https://github.com/denoland/rusty_v8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">rusty_v8<!-- --> <svg fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="1.7" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="1em"><path d="M7 17L17 7"></path><path d="M7 7h10v10"></path></svg></a>, part of the <a href="https://github.com/denoland/deno" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Deno project<!-- --> <svg fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="1.7" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="1em"><path d="M7 17L17 7"></path><path d="M7 7h10v10"></path></svg></a>, to bridge between V8’s C++ API and our Zig code.</p>
<p>Beyond integration, performance and memory control were essential. When you’re crawling thousands of pages or running automation at scale, every millisecond counts. We also needed precise control over short-lived allocations like DOM trees, JavaScript objects, and parsing buffers. Zig’s explicit allocator model fits that need perfectly.</p>
<h2 id="why-not-c">Why Not C++?<a href="#why-not-c" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h2>
<p>C++ was the obvious option: it powers virtually every major browser engine. But here’s what gave us pause.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Four decades of features</strong>: C++ has accumulated enormous complexity over the years. There are multiple ways to do almost everything: template metaprogramming, multiple inheritance patterns, various initialization syntaxes. We wanted a language with one clear way to do things.</li>
<li><strong>Memory management</strong>: Control comes with constant vigilance. Use-after-free bugs, memory leaks, and dangling pointers are real risks. Smart pointers help, but they add complexity and runtime overhead. Zig’s approach of passing allocators explicitly makes memory management clearer and enables patterns like arenas more naturally.</li>
<li><strong>Build systems</strong>: Anyone who’s fought with CMake or dealt with header file dependencies knows this pain. For a small team trying to move quickly, we didn’t want to waste time debugging build configuration issues.</li>
</ul>
<p>We’re not saying C++ is bad. It powers incredible software. But for a small team starting from scratch, we wanted something simpler.</p>
<h2 id="why-not-rust">Why not Rust?<a href="#why-not-rust" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h2>
<p>Many people ask this next. It’s a fair challenge. Rust is a more mature language than Zig, offers memory safety guarantees, has excellent tooling, and a growing ecosystem.</p>
<p>Rust would have been a viable choice. But for Lightpanda’s specific needs (and honestly, for our team’s experience level) it introduced friction we didn’t want.</p>
<h3 id="the-unsafe-rust-problem">The Unsafe Rust Problem<a href="#the-unsafe-rust-problem" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h3>
<p>When you need to do things the borrow checker doesn’t like, you end up writing unsafe Rust, which is surprisingly hard. <a href="https://zackoverflow.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Zack<!-- --> <svg fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="1.7" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="1em"><path d="M7 17L17 7"></path><path d="M7 7h10v10"></path></svg></a> from <a href="https://bun.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Bun<!-- --> <svg fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="1.7" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="1em"><path d="M7 17L17 7"></path><path d="M7 7h10v10"></path></svg></a> explores this in depth in his article <a href="https://zackoverflow.dev/writing/unsafe-rust-vs-zig/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">When Zig is safer and faster than Rust<!-- --> <svg fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="1.7" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="1em"><path d="M7 17L17 7"></path><path d="M7 7h10v10"></path></svg></a>.</p>
<p>Browser engines and garbage-collected runtimes are classic examples of code that fights the borrow checker. You’re constantly juggling different memory regions: per-page arenas, shared caches, temporary buffers, objects with complex interdependencies. These patterns don’t map cleanly to Rust’s ownership model. You end up either paying performance costs (using indices instead of pointers, unnecessary clones) or diving into unsafe code where raw pointer ergonomics are poor and Miri becomes your constant companion.</p>
<p>Zig takes a different approach. Rather than trying to enforce safety through the type system and then providing an escape hatch, Zig is designed for scenarios where you’re doing memory-unsafe things. It gives you tools to make that experience better: non-null pointers by default, the GeneralPurposeAllocator that catches use-after-free bugs in debug mode, and pointer types with good ergonomics.</p>
<h2 id="why-zig-works-for-lightpanda">Why Zig Works for Lightpanda<a href="#why-zig-works-for-lightpanda" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h2>
<p>Zig sits in an interesting space. It’s a simple language that’s easy to learn, where everything is explicit: no hidden control flow, no hidden allocations.</p>
<h3 id="explicit-memory-management-with-allocators">Explicit Memory Management with Allocators<a href="#explicit-memory-management-with-allocators" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h3>
<p>Zig makes you choose how memory is managed through allocators. Every allocation requires you to specify which allocator to use. This might sound tedious at first, but it gives you precise control.</p>
<p>Here’s what this looks like in practice, using an arena allocator:</p>

<p>This pattern matches browser workloads perfectly. Each page load gets its own arena. When the page is done, we throw away the entire memory chunk. No tracking individual allocations, no reference counting overhead, no garbage collection pauses. (Though we’re learning that single pages can grow large in memory, so we’re also exploring mid-lifecycle cleanup strategies). And you can chain arenas, to create short-lived objects inside a page lifecycle.</p>
<h3 id="compile-time-metaprogramming">Compile-Time Metaprogramming<a href="#compile-time-metaprogramming" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h3>
<p>Zig’s comptime feature lets you write code that runs during compilation. We use this extensively to reduce boilerplate when bridging Zig and JavaScript.</p>
<p>When integrating V8, you need to expose native types to JavaScript. In most languages, this requires glue code for each type. To generate this glue you need some code generation, usually through Macros (Rust, C, C++). Macros are a completely different language, which has a lot of downsides. Zig’s comptime lets us automate this:</p>

<p>The registerType function uses comptime reflection to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Find all public methods on Point</li>
<li>Generate JavaScript wrapper functions</li>
<li>Create property getters/setters for x and y</li>
<li>Handle type conversions automatically</li>
</ul>
<p>This eliminates manual binding code and makes adding new types simple by using the same language at compile time and runtime.</p>
<h3 id="c-interop-that-just-works">C Interop That Just Works<a href="#c-interop-that-just-works" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h3>
<p>Zig’s C interop is a first-class feature: you can directly import C header files and call C functions without wrapper libraries.</p>
<p>For example, we use cURL as our HTTP library. We can just import libcurl C headers in Zig and use the C functions directly:</p>

<p>It feels as simple as using C, except you are programming in Zig.</p>
<p>And with the build system it’s also very simple to add the C sources to build everything together (your zig code and the C libraries):</p>

<p>This simplicity of importing C mitigates the fact that the Zig ecosystem is still small, as you can use all the existing C libraries.</p>
<h3 id="the-build-system-advantage">The Build System Advantage<a href="#the-build-system-advantage" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h3>
<p>Zig includes its own build system written in Zig itself. This might sound unremarkable, but compared to CMake, it’s refreshingly straightforward. Adding dependencies, configuring compilation flags, and managing cross-compilation all happen in one place with clear semantics. Runtime, comptime, build system: everything is in Zig, which makes things easier.</p>
<p>Cross-compilation in particular is usually a difficult topic, but it’s very easy with Zig. Some projects like <a href="https://thamizhelango.medium.com/why-uber-chose-zig-as-their-c-c-toolchain-a-technical-deep-dive-771584e57c5b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Uber<!-- --> <svg fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="1.7" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="1em"><path d="M7 17L17 7"></path><path d="M7 7h10v10"></path></svg></a> use Zig mainly as a build system and toolchain.</p>
<h3 id="compile-times-matter">Compile times matter<a href="#compile-times-matter" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h3>
<p>Zig compiles fast. Our full rebuild takes under a minute. Not as fast as Go or an interpreted language, but enough to have a feedback loop that makes development feel responsive. In that regard, Zig is considerably faster than Rust or C++.</p>
<p>This is a strong focus of the Zig team. They are also a small team and they need fast compilation for the development of the language, as Zig is written in Zig (self-hosted). For that purpose, they are developing native compiler backends (i.e. not using LLVM), which is very ambitious and yet successful: it’s already the default backend for x86 in debug mode, with a significant improvement in build times (<a href="https://ziglang.org/devlog/2025/#2025-06-08" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">3.5x faster for the Zig project itself<!-- --> <svg fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="1.7" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="1em"><path d="M7 17L17 7"></path><path d="M7 7h10v10"></path></svg></a>).

<p>After months of building Lightpanda in Zig, here’s what stands out.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The learning curve is manageable.</strong> Zig’s simplicity means you can understand the entire language in a few weeks. Compared to Rust or C++, this makes a real difference.</li>
<li><strong>The allocator model pays off.</strong> Being able to create arena allocators per page load, per request, or per task gives us fine-grained memory control without tracking individual allocations.</li>
<li><strong>The community</strong> is small but helpful. Zig is still growing. The Discord community and <a href="https://ziggit.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">ziggit.dev<!-- --> <svg fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="1.7" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="1em"><path d="M7 17L17 7"></path><path d="M7 7h10v10"></path></svg></a> are active, and the language is simple enough that you can often figure things out by reading the standard library source.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h2>
<p>Lightpanda wouldn’t exist without the work of the Zig Foundation and the community behind it. Zig has made it possible to build something as complex as a browser with a small team and a clear mental model, without sacrificing performance.</p>

<h3 id="is-zig-stable-enough-for-production-use">Is Zig stable enough for production use?<a href="#is-zig-stable-enough-for-production-use" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h3>
<p>Zig is still pre-1.0, which means breaking changes can happen between versions. That said, we’ve found it stable enough for our production use, especially since the ecosystem has largely standardized on tracking the latest tagged releases rather than main. The language itself is well-designed, and most changes between versions are improvements that are worth adapting to. Just be prepared to update code when upgrading Zig versions.</p>
<h3 id="whats-the-hardest-part-about-learning-zig">What’s the hardest part about learning Zig?<a href="#whats-the-hardest-part-about-learning-zig" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h3>
<p>The allocator model takes adjustment if you’re coming from garbage-collected languages. You need to think about where memory comes from and when it gets freed. But compared to Rust’s borrow checker or C++‘s memory management, it’s relatively straightforward once you understand the patterns.</p>
<h3 id="can-zig-really-replace-c-for-browser-development">Can Zig really replace C++ for browser development?<a href="#can-zig-really-replace-c-for-browser-development" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h3>
<p>For building a focused browser like Lightpanda, yes. For replacing Chromium or Firefox, that’s unlikely: those projects have millions of lines of C++ and decades of optimization. We’re more likely to see Rust complementing C++ in those projects over time, for example how Firefox is leveraging <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Servo<!-- --> <svg fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="1.7" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="1em"><path d="M7 17L17 7"></path><path d="M7 7h10v10"></path></svg></a>.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://www.synadia.com/blog/synadia-tigerbeetle-zig-foundation-pledge">Synadia</a>
and TigerBeetle have together pledged $512,000 to the <a href="https://ziglang.org/">Zig Software Foundation</a> over the next two
years in support of the language, leadership, and communities building
the future of simpler systems software.</p>
<h2 id="choosing-zig-for-tigerbeetle"></h2>
<p>I first saw Zig in 2018, seven years ago. Two years later, I chose
Zig over C or Rust for TigerBeetle.</p>
<h2 id="why-not-rust"></h2>
<p>In 2020, I was following Rust closely. At the time, Rust’s default
memory philosophy was to crash when out of memory (OOM). However, for
TigerBeetle, I wanted explicit static allocation, following <a href="https://spinroot.com/gerard/pdf/P10.pdf">NASA’s Power of Ten Rules
for Safety-Critical Code</a>, which would become a part of <a href="https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/blob/main/docs/TIGER_STYLE.md">TigerStyle</a>,
a methodology for creating <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3WYdYyjek4">safer software in
less time</a>.</p>
<h2 id="simplified-memory-management"></h2>
<p>What I learned is that if you could centralize resource allocation in
time and space (the dimensions that prove tricky for humans writing
software) then this could not only simplify memory management, to design
away some of the need for a borrow checker in the first place, but, more
importantly, also be a forcing function for propagating good design, to
encourage teams to think through the explicit limits or physics of the
software (you have no choice).</p>
<h2 id="not-fearlessly-multithreaded"></h2>
<p>From a performance perspective, I didn’t want TigerBeetle to be
fearlessly multithreaded. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKgfk8lTQuE">Transaction
processing workloads tend to have inherent contention</a>, even to the
point of power law, precluding partitioning and necessitating a
single-threaded architecture. Therefore, Rust’s borrow checker, while a
phenomenal tool for the class of problems it targets, made less sense
for TigerBeetle. TigerBeetle never frees memory and never runs
multithreaded, instead using explicit submission/completion queue
interfaces by design.</p>
<h2 id="correctness-is-a-design-problem"></h2>
<p>Finally, while the borrow checker could achieve local memory safety,
TigerBeetle needed more correctness properties. TigerBeetle needed to be
always correct, and across literally thousands of invariants. <a href="https://matklad.github.io/2023/03/26/zig-and-rust.html">As matklad
would say, this is a harder problem!</a> I had also spent enough time in
memory safe languages to know that local memory safety is no guarantee
of local correctness, let alone distributed system correctness. Per
systems thinking, I believe that total correctness is a design problem,
not a language problem. Language is valuable. But no human language can
guarantee the next Hemingway or Nabokov. For this you need philosophy.
Even then it’s not a guarantee but a probability.</p>
<p>With Rust off the table, the choice fell to C or Zig. A language of
the past or future?</p>
<h2 id="why-zig"></h2>
<p>Zig was early, which gave me pause, but I felt that the quality of
Andrew Kelley’s design decisions in the language, the standard library
(e.g. the unmanaged hashmap interface) and the cross-compilation
toolchain, even five years ago, was already exceptional.</p>
<h2 id="more-than-a-language-a-philosophy"></h2>
<p>Andrews’s philosophy resonated with what I wanted to explore in
TigerStyle. No hidden memory allocations. No hidden control flow. No
preprocessor. No macros. And then you get things like comptime, reducing
the grammar and dimensionality of the language, while simultaneously
multiplying its power. The primary benefit of Zig is the favorable ratio
of expressivity to language complexity.</p>
<h2 id="a-better-c"></h2>
<p>As a replacement for C, Zig fixed not only the small cuts, such as
explicit alignment in the type system for Direct I/O, or safer casts,
but the showstoppers of spatial memory safety through bounds checking,
and, to a lesser degree (but not guarantee), temporal memory safety
through the debug allocator.</p>
<h2 id="checked-arithmetic"></h2>
<p>Zig also enabled checked arithmetic by default in safe builds, which
is something I believe only Ada and Swift do (remarkably, Rust disables
checked arithmetic by default in safe builds—a default I would love to
see changed). TigerBeetle separates the data plane from the control
plane by design, through batching, so the runtime cost of these safety
checks was not material, being amortized in the data plane across bigger
buffers. While a borrow checker or static allocation can simplify memory
management, getting logic and arithmetic correct remains hard. Of
course, you can enable checked arithmetic in other languages, but I
appreciated Andrew’s concern for checked arithmetic and stricter
operands by default.</p>
<h2 id="safety-as-a-spectrum"></h2>
<p>In all these things, what impressed me most was Zig’s approach to
safety when working with the metal. Not in terms of an on/off decision,
but as a spectrum. Not aiming for 100% guarantees across 1 or 2
categories, but 90% and then across more categories. Not eliminating
classes of bugs, but downgrading their probability. All while preserving
the power-to-weight ratio of the language, to keep the language
beautifully simple.</p>
<h2 id="essential-simplicity"></h2>
<p>Many languages start simple and grow complex as features are added.
Zig’s simplicity is unusual in that it comes from a subtractive
discipline (e.g. no private fields) rather than a deferred complexity;
minimizing surface area is part of the ethos of the language. The
simplicity of Zig meant that we could hire great programmers from any
language background—they could pick up Zig in a weekend. Indeed, I’ve
never had to talk to a new hire about learning Zig.</p>
<h2 id="skate-to-where-the-puck-is-going"></h2>
<p>Finally, there was the timing. Recognizing that TigerBeetle would
take time to reach production (we shipped production in 2024, after 3.5
years of development), giving Zig time to mature, for our trajectories
to intersect.</p>
<p>Investing in creating a database like TigerBeetle is a long term
effort. Databases tend to have a long half life (e.g. Postgres is 30
years old). And so, while Zig being early in 2020 did give me pause,
nevertheless Zig’s quality, philosophy and simplicity made sense for a
multi-decade horizon.</p>
<h2 id="fast-forward-five-years-later"></h2>
<p>How has the decision for Zig panned out?</p>
<h2 id="surviving-vopr-vörtex-and-jepsen"></h2>
<p>TigerBeetle is tested end-to-end under some pretty extreme fuzzing.
We did have three bugs that would have been prevented by the borrow
checker, but these were caught by our fuzzers and online verification.
We run a fuzzing fleet of 1,000 dedicated CPU cores 24/7. We invest in
deterministic simulation testing (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/blob/main/docs/internals/vopr.md">VOPR</a>),
as well as non-deterministic fault-injection harnesses (e.g. <a href="https://tigerbeetle.com/blog/2025-02-13-a-descent-into-the-vortex/">Vörtex</a>).
We engaged Kyle Kingsbury in <a href="https://jepsen.io/analyses/tigerbeetle-0.16.11">one of the longest
Jepsen audits to date</a>—four times the typical duration. Through all
this, Zig’s quality held up flawlessly.</p>
<h2 id="tight-tolerances-and-velocity"></h2>
<p>Zig has also been a huge part of our success as a company.
TigerBeetle is only 5 years old but is already migrating some of the
largest brokerages, exchanges and wealth managements in their respective
jurisdictions. Several of our key enterprise contracts were thanks to
the CTOs and even CEOs of these companies also following Zig and seeing
the quality we wanted to achieve with it. I don’t think we could have
written TigerBeetle <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/uhtjdz/rust_vs_zig_reality_somewhat_friendly#c_8rtrto">as
it is, in any other language</a>, at least not to the same tight
tolerances, let alone with the same velocity.</p>
<h2 id="pre-10-breaking-changes"></h2>
<p>Zig’s language specification will only reach 1.0 when all
experimental areas of the language (e.g. async I/O) are finally done.
For TigerBeetle, we care only about the stable language features we use,
testing our binaries end to end, as we would for any language.
Nevertheless, upgrading to new versions, even with breaking changes, has
only been a pleasure for us as a team. The upgrade work is usually fully
paid for by compilation time reduction. For example, the upgrade from
Zig 0.14.1 to Zig 0.15.2 (with the native x86_64 backend) makes debug
builds 2x faster, and even LLVM release builds become 1.6x faster. With
each release, you can literally feel the sheer amount of effort that the
entire Zig core team put into making Zig the world’s most powerful
programming language—and toolchain.</p>
<h2 id="one-level-deeper"></h2>
<p>Back in 2020, from a production perspective, Zig was more or less a
frontend to LLVM, the same compiler used by Rust, Swift and other
languages. However, by not shying away from also investing in its own
independent compiler backends and toolchain, by appreciating the value
of replacing LLVM long term, Zig is becoming well positioned to gain a
low-level precision and compilation speed that generic LLVM won’t always
be able to match.</p>
<h2 id="long-live-the-bdfl"></h2>
<p>We want Andrew to take his time, to get these things right for the
long term. Fred Brooks once said that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month">conceptual
integrity</a> is “the most important consideration” in system design,
that the design must proceed from one mind.</p>
<p>In this spirit, I am grateful for Andrew’s remarkably strong
leadership (and taste) in the design of the language and toolchain.
There can be thankless pressure on an open source project to give in to
the tragedy of the commons. But if anything, in hindsight I think this
is what I’ve most appreciated about choosing Zig for TigerBeetle, that
Zig has a strong BDFL.</p>
<p>Of course, some may hear “BDFL” and see governance risk. But I fear
the opposite: conceptual risk, the harder problem. Brooks was
right—conceptual integrity is almost certainly doomed by committee.
Whereas governance is easier solved: put it in the hands, not of the
corporates, but of the people. The individuals who choose each day to
continue to donate.</p>
<h2 id="a-simple-pledge"></h2>
<p>This is why our pledge today, along with all other ZSF donors, is a
simple donation with no strings attached. The Zig Software Foundation is
well managed, transparent and independent. We want it to remain this
way. The last thing we want is some kind of foundation “seat”. Andrew is
Chef. We want to let him cook, and pay his core team sustainably (e.g.
<a href="https://ziglang.org/news/2025-financials/">92% percent of
budget goes to directly paying contributors</a>).</p>
<h2 id="surfing-the-swell"></h2>
<p>If cooking is one metaphor, then surfing is another. I believe that
technology moves in waves. The art is not in paddling to the wave with a
thousand surfers on it. But in spotting the swell before it breaks. And
then enjoying the ride with the early adopters who did the same. <a href="https://isaacfreund.com/software/river/">River</a>, <a href="https://ghostty.org/">Ghostty</a>, <a href="https://bun.com/">Bun</a>, <a href="https://github.com/hexops/mach">Mach</a> and many fellow
surfers.</p>
<h2 id="partnering-with-synadia"></h2>
<p>In fact, it was through Zig that I met <a href="https://x.com/derekcollison">Derek Collison</a>, who like me had
been sponsoring the language in his personal capacity since 2018. As a
former CTO at VMware, Derek was responsible for backing <a href="https://antirez.com/">antirez</a> to work full time on Redis. Derek
later went on to create <a href="https://nats.io/">NATS</a>, founding <a href="https://www.synadia.com/">Synadia</a>.</p>
<p>As we were about to increase TigerBeetle’s yearly donation to Zig, I
reached out to Derek, and we decided to do a joint announcement, <a href="https://mitchellh.com/writing/zig-donation">following Mitchell
Hashimoto’s lead</a>. For each of our companies to donate $256,000 in
monthly installments over the next two years, with Synadia matching
TigerBeetle, for a total of $512,000—the first installment already
made.</p>
<h2 id="for-great-justice-take-off-every-zig"></h2>
<p>Please consider <a href="https://ziglang.org/zsf/">donating</a> or
increasing your donation if you can. And if you are a CEO or CTO, please
team up with another company to outmatch us! Thanks Andrew for creating
something special, and to all who code for the joy of the craft:</p>
<p>Together we serve the users.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    

      <p>I have a hobby.</p>
<p>Whenever I see the comment <code>// this should never happen</code> in code, I try to find out the exact conditions under which <em>it could</em> happen.
And in 90% of cases, I find a way to do just that.
More often than not, the developer just hasn’t considered all edge cases or future code changes.</p>
<p>In fact, the reason why I like this comment so much is that it often <strong>marks the exact spot</strong> where strong guarantees fall apart.
Often, violating implicit invariants that aren’t enforced by the compiler are the root cause.</p>
<p>Yes, the compiler prevents memory safety issues, and the standard library is best-in-class.
But even the standard library <a href="https://corrode.dev/blog/pitfalls-of-safe-rust">has its warts</a> and bugs in business logic can still happen.</p>
<p>All we can work with are hard-learned patterns to write more defensive Rust code, learned throughout years of shipping Rust code to production.
I’m not talking about design patterns here, but rather small idioms, which are rarely documented, but make a big difference in the overall code quality.</p>
<h2 id="code-smell-indexing-into-a-vector"><a href="#code-smell-indexing-into-a-vector" aria-label="Anchor link for: code-smell-indexing-into-a-vector">Code Smell: Indexing Into a Vector</a></h2>
<p>Here’s some innocent-looking code:</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span>if</span> <span>!</span>matching_users<span>.</span><span>is_empty</span><span><span>(</span></span><span><span>)</span></span> <span><span>{</span>
</span></span><span><span>    <span>let</span> existing_user <span>=</span> <span>&amp;</span>matching_users<span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span></span><span>;</span>
</span></span><span><span>    <span><span>//</span> ...
</span></span></span><span><span></span><span><span>}</span></span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>What if you refactor it and forget to keep the <code>is_empty()</code> check?
The problem is that the vector indexing is decoupled from checking the length.
So <code>matching_users[0]</code> can panic at runtime if the vector is empty.</p>
<p>Checking the length and indexing are two separate operations, which can be changed independently.
That’s our first implicit invariant that’s not enforced by the compiler.</p>
<p>If we use slice pattern matching instead, we’ll only get access to the element if the correct <code>match</code> arm is executed.</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span>match</span> matching_users<span>.</span><span>as_slice</span><span><span>(</span></span><span><span>)</span></span> <span><span>{</span>

</span></code></pre>
<p>Note how this automatically uncovered one more edge case: what if the list is empty?
We hadn’t explicitly considered this case before.
The compiler-enforced pattern matching requires us to think about all possible states!
This is a common pattern in all robust Rust code: putting the compiler in charge of enforcing invariants.</p>
<h2 id="code-smell-lazy-use-of-default"><a href="#code-smell-lazy-use-of-default" aria-label="Anchor link for: code-smell-lazy-use-of-default">Code Smell: Lazy use of <code>Default</code></a></h2>
<p>When initializing an object with many fields, it’s tempting to use <code>..Default::default()</code> to fill in the rest.
In practice, this is a common source of bugs.
You might forget to explicitly set a new field later when you add it to the struct (thus using the default value instead, which might not be what you want), or you might not be aware of all the fields that are being set to default values.</p>
<p>Instead of this:</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span>let</span> foo <span>=</span> Foo <span><span>{</span>
</span></span><span><span>    field1<span>:</span> value1<span>,</span>
</span></span><span><span>    field2<span>:</span> value2<span>,</span>
</span></span><span><span>    <span>..</span><span>Default</span><span><span>::</span></span>default<span><span>(</span></span><span><span>)</span></span>  <span><span>//</span> Implicitly sets all other fields
</span></span></span><span><span></span><span><span>}</span></span><span>;</span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>Do this:</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span>let</span> foo <span>=</span> Foo <span><span>{</span>
</span></span><span><span>    field1<span>:</span> value1<span>,</span>
</span></span><span><span>    field2<span>:</span> value2<span>,</span>
</span></span><span><span>    field3<span>:</span> value3<span>,</span> <span><span>//</span> Explicitly set all fields
</span></span></span><span><span>    field4<span>:</span> value4<span>,</span>
</span></span><span><span>    <span><span>//</span> ...
</span></span></span><span><span></span><span><span>}</span></span><span>;</span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>Yes, it’s slightly more verbose, but what you gain is that the compiler will force you to handle all fields explicitly.
Now when you add a new field to <code>Foo</code>, the compiler will remind you to set it here as well and reflect on which value makes sense.</p>
<p>If you still prefer to use <code>Default</code> but don’t want to lose compiler checks, you can also destructure the default instance:</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span>let</span> Foo <span><span>{</span> field1<span>,</span> field2<span>,</span> field3<span>,</span> field4 </span><span><span>}</span></span> <span>=</span> <span>Foo<span>::</span></span>default<span><span>(</span></span><span><span>)</span></span><span>;</span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>This way, you get all the default values assigned to local variables and you can still override what you need:</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span>let</span> foo <span>=</span> Foo <span><span>{</span>
</span></span><span><span>    field1<span>:</span> value1<span>,</span>    <span><span>//</span> Override what you need
</span></span></span><span><span>    field2<span>:</span> value2<span>,</span>    <span><span>//</span> Override what you need
</span></span></span><span><span>    field3<span>,</span>            <span><span>//</span> Use default value
</span></span></span><span><span>    field4<span>,</span>            <span><span>//</span> Use default value
</span></span></span><span><span></span><span><span>}</span></span><span>;</span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>This pattern gives you the best of both worlds:</p>
<ul>
<li>You get default values without duplicating default logic</li>
<li>The compiler will complain when new fields are added to the struct</li>
<li>Your code automatically adapts when default values change</li>
<li>It’s clear which fields use defaults and which have custom values</li>
</ul>

<p>Completely destructuring a struct into its components can also be a defensive strategy for API adherence.
For example, let’s say you’re building a pizza ordering system and have an order type like this:</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span><span>struct</span> </span><span><span>PizzaOrder</span> </span><span><span><span>{</span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span>    <span>size</span><span>:</span> PizzaSize,
</span></span></span><span><span><span>    <span>toppings</span><span>:</span> <span><span>Vec</span><span>&lt;</span>Topping<span>&gt;</span></span>,
</span></span></span><span><span><span>    <span>crust_type</span><span>:</span> CrustType,
</span></span></span><span><span><span>    <span>ordered_at</span><span>:</span> SystemTime,
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span><span>}</span></span></span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>For your order tracking system, you want to compare orders based on what’s actually on the pizza - the <code>size</code>, <code>toppings</code>, and <code>crust_type</code>. The <code>ordered_at</code> timestamp shouldn’t affect whether two orders are considered the same.</p>
<p>Here’s the problem with the obvious approach:</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span><span>impl</span> </span><span>PartialEq <span>for</span></span><span> <span>PizzaOrder</span> </span><span><span><span>{</span>

</span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>        <span>self</span><span>.</span>size <span>==</span> other<span>.</span>size 
</span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>            <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>self</span><span>.</span>toppings <span>==</span> other<span>.</span>toppings 
</span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>            <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>self</span><span>.</span>crust_type <span>==</span> other<span>.</span>crust_type
</span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>            </span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>    </span><span><span>}</span></span></span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span><span>}</span></span></span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>Now imagine your team adds a field for customization options:</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span><span>struct</span> </span><span><span>PizzaOrder</span> </span><span><span><span>{</span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span>    <span>size</span><span>:</span> PizzaSize,
</span></span></span><span><span><span>    <span>toppings</span><span>:</span> <span><span>Vec</span><span>&lt;</span>Topping<span>&gt;</span></span>,
</span></span></span><span><span><span>    <span>crust_type</span><span>:</span> CrustType,
</span></span></span><span><span><span>    <span>ordered_at</span><span>:</span> SystemTime,
</span></span></span><span><span><span>    <span>extra_cheese</span><span>:</span> <span>bool</span>, <span> New field added
</span></span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span><span>}</span></span></span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>Your <code>PartialEq</code> implementation still compiles, but is it correct?
Should <code>extra_cheese</code> be part of the equality check?
Probably yes - a pizza with extra cheese is a different order!
But you’ll never know because the compiler won’t remind you to think about it.</p>
<p>Here’s the defensive approach using destructuring:</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span><span>impl</span> </span><span>PartialEq <span>for</span></span><span> <span>PizzaOrder</span> </span><span><span><span>{</span>

</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span><span>}</span></span></span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>Now when someone adds the <code>extra_cheese</code> field, this code won’t compile anymore.
The compiler forces you to decide: should <code>extra_cheese</code> be included in the comparison or explicitly ignored with <code>extra_cheese: _</code>?</p>
<p>This pattern works for any trait implementation where you need to handle struct fields: <code>Hash</code>, <code>Debug</code>, <code>Clone</code>, etc.
It’s especially valuable in codebases where structs evolve frequently as requirements change.</p>

<p>The <code>unwrap_or_else</code> is a hint that this conversion can fail in some way.
We set a default value instead, but is it really the right thing to do for all callers?
This should be a <code>TryFrom</code> implementation instead, making the fallible nature explicit.
We fail fast instead of continuing with a potentially flawed business logic.</p>

<h2 id="pattern-temporary-mutability"><a href="#pattern-temporary-mutability" aria-label="Anchor link for: pattern-temporary-mutability">Pattern: Temporary Mutability</a></h2>
<p>If you only want your data to be mutable temporarily, make that explicit.</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span>let</span> <span>mut</span> data <span>=</span> <span>get_vec</span><span><span>(</span></span><span><span>)</span></span><span>;</span>
</span><span>data<span>.</span><span>sort</span><span><span>(</span></span><span><span>)</span></span><span>;</span>
</span><span><span>let</span> data <span>=</span> data<span>;</span>  <span><span>//</span> Shadow to make immutable
</span></span><span>
</span><span><span><span>//</span> Here `data` is immutable.
</span></span></code></pre>
<p>This pattern is often called “temporary mutability” and helps prevent accidental modifications after initialization.
See the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://rust-unofficial.github.io/patterns/idioms/temporary-mutability.html">Rust unofficial patterns book</a> for more details.</p>
<p>You can go one step further and do the initialization part in a scope block:</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span>let</span> data <span>=</span> <span><span>{</span>
</span></span><span><span>    <span>let</span> <span>mut</span> data <span>=</span> <span>get_vec</span><span><span>(</span></span><span><span>)</span></span><span>;</span>
</span></span><span><span>    data<span>.</span><span>sort</span><span><span>(</span></span><span><span>)</span></span><span>;</span>
</span></span><span><span>    data  <span><span>//</span> Return the final value
</span></span></span><span><span></span><span><span>}</span></span><span>;</span>
</span><span><span><span>//</span> Here `data` is immutable
</span></span></code></pre>
<p>This way, the mutable variable is confined to the inner scope, making it clear that it’s only used for initialization.
In case you use any temporary variables during initialization, they won’t leak into the outer scope.
In our case above, there were none, but imagine if we had a temporary vector to hold intermediate results:</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span>let</span> data <span>=</span> <span><span>{</span>
</span></span><span><span>    <span>let</span> <span>mut</span> data <span>=</span> <span>get_vec</span><span><span>(</span></span><span><span>)</span></span><span>;</span>
</span></span><span><span>    <span>let</span> temp <span>=</span> <span>compute_something</span><span><span>(</span></span><span><span>)</span></span><span>;</span>
</span></span><span><span>    data<span>.</span><span>extend</span><span><span>(</span>temp</span><span><span>)</span></span><span>;</span>
</span></span><span><span>    data<span>.</span><span>sort</span><span><span>(</span></span><span><span>)</span></span><span>;</span>
</span></span><span><span>    data  <span><span>//</span> Return the final value
</span></span></span><span><span></span><span><span>}</span></span><span>;</span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>Here, <code>temp</code> is only accessible within the inner scope, which prevents it from accidental use later on.</p>
<p>This is especially useful when you have multiple temporary variables during initialization that you don’t want accessible in the rest of the function.
The scope makes it crystal clear that these variables are only meant for initialization.</p>

In such a case, you want to ensure that all instances of a type are created through a constructor function that enforces validation logic.
Because without that, future refactorings can easily lead to invalid states.</p>
<p>For application code, it’s probably best to keep things simple.
You typically have all the call sites under control and can ensure that validation logic is always called.</p>

</div>
<p>Let’s say you have a simple type like the following:</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span><span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> </span><span><span>S</span> </span><span><span><span>{</span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span>    <span>pub</span> <span>field1</span><span>:</span> String,
</span></span></span><span><span><span>    <span>pub</span> <span>field2</span><span>:</span> <span>u32</span>,
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span><span>}</span></span></span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>Now you want to add validation logic to ensure invalid states are never created.
One pattern is to return a <code>Result</code> from the constructor:</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span><span>impl</span> </span><span><span>S</span> </span><span><span><span>{</span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span>    <span><span><span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> </span><span>new</span></span><span><span><span>(</span><span>field1</span><span>:</span> String, <span>field2</span><span>:</span> <span>u32</span></span><span><span><span>)</span></span></span></span><span> <span><span>-&gt;</span> <span><span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Self</span>, <span>String</span><span>&gt;</span></span></span> </span><span><span><span>{</span>

</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>        </span><span><span>}</span></span>
</span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>        <span>if</span> field2 <span>==</span> <span>0</span> <span><span>{</span>
</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>            <span>return</span> <span>Err</span><span><span>(</span><span><span>"</span>field2 cannot be zero<span>"</span></span><span>.</span><span>to_string</span><span><span>(</span></span><span><span>)</span></span></span><span><span>)</span></span><span>;</span>
</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>        </span><span><span>}</span></span>

</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span><span>}</span></span></span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>But nothing stops someone from bypassing your validation by creating an instance directly:</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span>let</span> s <span>=</span> S <span><span>{</span>
</span></span><span><span>    field1<span>:</span> <span><span>"</span><span>"</span></span><span>.</span><span>to_string</span><span><span>(</span></span><span><span>)</span></span><span>,</span>
</span></span><span><span>    field2<span>:</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span>
</span></span><span><span></span><span><span>}</span></span><span>;</span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>This should not be possible!
It is our implicit invariant that’s not enforced by the compiler: the validation logic is decoupled from struct construction.
These are two separate operations, which can be changed independently and the compiler won’t complain.</p>
<p>To force <strong>external code</strong> to go through your constructor, add a private field:</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span><span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> </span><span><span>S</span> </span><span><span><span>{</span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span>    <span>pub</span> <span>field1</span><span>:</span> String,

</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span><span>}</span></span></span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>Now code outside your module cannot construct <code>S</code> directly because it cannot access the <code>_private</code> field.
The compiler enforces that all construction must go through your <code>new()</code> method, which includes your validation logic!</p>
<div>
  
  
  
  <p>Note that the underscore prefix is just a <strong>naming convention</strong> to indicate the field is intentionally unused; it’s the lack of <code>pub</code> that makes it private and prevents external construction.</p>

</div>
<p>For libraries that need to evolve over time, you can also use the <code>#[non_exhaustive]</code> attribute instead:</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span><span>#</span><span>[</span><span>non_exhaustive</span><span>]</span></span>
</span><span><span><span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> </span><span><span>S</span> </span><span><span><span>{</span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span>    <span>pub</span> <span>field1</span><span>:</span> String,
</span></span></span><span><span><span>    <span>pub</span> <span>field2</span><span>:</span> <span>u32</span>,
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span><span>}</span></span></span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>This has the same effect of preventing construction outside your crate, but also signals to users that you might add more fields in the future.
The compiler will prevent them from using struct literal syntax, forcing them to use your constructor.</p>
<div>
  
  
  
  <p>There’s a big difference between these two approaches:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>#[non_exhaustive]</code> only works across crate boundaries. <strong>It prevents construction outside your crate.</strong></li>
<li><code>_private</code> works at the module boundary. <strong>It prevents construction outside the module</strong>, but within the same crate.</li>
</ul>
<p>On top of that, some developers find <code>_private: ()</code> more explicit about intent: “this struct has a private field that prevents construction.”</p>
<p>With <code>#[non_exhaustive]</code>, the primary intent is signaling that fields might be added in the future, and preventing construction is more of a side effect.</p>

</div>
<p>But what about code within the <strong>same module</strong>?
With the patterns above, code in the same module can still bypass your validation:</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span><span>//</span> Still compiles in the same module!
</span></span><span><span>let</span> s <span>=</span> S <span><span>{</span>
</span></span><span><span>    field1<span>:</span> <span><span>"</span><span>"</span></span><span>.</span><span>to_string</span><span><span>(</span></span><span><span>)</span></span><span>,</span>
</span></span><span><span>    field2<span>:</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span>
</span></span><span><span>    _private<span>:</span> <span><span>(</span></span><span><span>)</span></span><span>,</span>
</span></span><span><span></span><span><span>}</span></span><span>;</span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>Rust’s privacy works at the module level, not the type level.
Anything in the same module can access private items.</p>
<p>If you need to enforce constructor usage even within your own module, you need a more defensive approach using nested private modules:</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span><span>mod</span> <span>inner</span> <span><span>{</span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span>    <span><span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> </span><span><span>S</span> </span><span><span><span>{</span>

<p>Now the only way to create an instance of <code>S</code> is through the <code>new()</code> method, and the only way to access its fields is through the getter methods.</p>
<h3 id="when-to-use-each"><a href="#when-to-use-each" aria-label="Anchor link for: when-to-use-each">When to Use Each</a></h3>
<p>To enforce validation through constructors:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>For external code</strong>: Add a private field like <code>_private: ()</code> or use <code>#[non_exhaustive]</code></li>
<li><strong>For internal code</strong>: Use nested private modules with a private “seal” type</li>
<li><strong>Choose based on your needs</strong>: Most code only needs to prevent external construction; forcing internal construction is more defensive but also more complex</li>
</ul>
<p>The key insight is that by making construction impossible without access to a private type, you turn your validation logic from a convention into a guarantee enforced by the compiler.
So let’s put that compiler to work!</p>
<h2 id="pattern-use-must-use-on-important-types"><a href="#pattern-use-must-use-on-important-types" aria-label="Anchor link for: pattern-use-must-use-on-important-types">Pattern: Use <code>#[must_use]</code> on Important Types</a></h2>
<p>The <code>#[must_use]</code> attribute is often neglected.
That’s sad, because it’s such a simple yet powerful mechanism to prevent callers from accidentally ignoring important return values.</p>

<p>Now if someone creates a <code>Config</code> but forgets to use it, the compiler will warn them

<p>This is especially useful for guard types that need to be held for their lifetime and results from operations that must be checked.
The standard library uses this extensively.
For example, <code>Result</code> is marked with <code>#[must_use]</code>, which is why you get warnings if you don’t handle errors.</p>
<h2 id="code-smell-boolean-parameters"><a href="#code-smell-boolean-parameters" aria-label="Anchor link for: code-smell-boolean-parameters">Code Smell: Boolean Parameters</a></h2>
<p>Boolean parameters make code hard to read at the call site and are error-prone.
We all know the scenario where we’re sure this will be the last boolean parameter we’ll ever add to a function.</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span><span>//</span> Too many boolean parameters

</span></span></code></pre>
<p>It’s impossible to understand what this code does without looking at the function signature.
Even worse, it’s easy to accidentally swap the boolean values.</p>
<p>Instead, use enums to make the intent explicit:</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span><span>enum</span> <span>Compression</span> <span><span>{</span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span>    Strong<span>,</span>

</span></code></pre>
<p>This is much more readable and the compiler will catch mistakes if you pass the wrong enum type.
You will notice that the enum variants can be more descriptive than just <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>.
And more often than not, there are more than two meaningful options; especially for programs which grow over time.</p>
<p>For functions with many options, you can configure them using a parameter struct:</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span><span>struct</span> </span><span><span>ProcessDataParams</span> </span><span><span><span>{</span>

</span></code></pre>
<p>This approach scales much better as your function evolves.
Adding new parameters doesn’t break existing call sites, and you can easily add defaults or make certain fields optional.
The preset methods also document common use cases and make it easy to use the right configuration for different scenarios.</p>
<p>Rust is often criticized for not having named parameters, but using a parameter struct is arguably even better for larger functions with many options.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion" aria-label="Anchor link for: conclusion">Conclusion</a></h2>
<p>Defensive programming in Rust is about leveraging the type system and compiler to catch bugs before they happen.
By following these patterns, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make implicit invariants explicit and compiler-checked</li>
<li>Future-proof your code against refactoring mistakes</li>
<li>Reduce the surface area for bugs</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s a skill that doesn’t come naturally and it’s not covered in most Rust books, but knowing these patterns can make the difference between code that works but is brittle, and code that is robust and maintainable for years to come.</p>
<p>Remember: if you find yourself writing <code>// this should never happen</code>, take a step back and ask how the compiler could enforce that invariant for you instead.
The best bug is the one that never compiles in the first place.</p>

<div><p>That's right, both before US Consulates when applying for visas, before CBP when applying for admission, and before USCIS when applying for a benefit (H-1B, O-1, green card, etc.), social media is being reviewed, not across-the-board but more and more.  And there's really no option to keep social media as private if asked to turn to public by a Consular Officer or CBP Officer.  The review is broad and not limited to social media that is critical of US policy but extends to a review of an individual's entire background to make sure there were no violations of US immigration law, including unauthorized employment.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46164011"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="2"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="80"></td><td><center><a id="up_46164011" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46164011&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46163121"></a></center></td><td><br>

<div><p>I think a related but separate question would be "Can I do these things if the proceeds are going directly to charity instead of to me?"</p><p>I suspect it would be important that any funds never reached you, so you couldn't simply receive money then donate that amount.

I understand that even if these issues favor the petitioner at Step 1 they may not change the outcome of the final merits determination under Step 2, and I am trying to determine how a post Chevron, strictly textual approach might influence Step 1 outcomes for petitioners whose achievements do not align neatly with the ten listed criteria.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46164489"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="0"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td><center><a id="up_46164489" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46164489&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46163121"></a></center></td><td><br>

</p>
<p>MetaComputing is now offering an alternative to Intel, AMD and the Snapdragon X series. Specifically, the company has introduced a mainboard that can be installe in the Framework Laptop 13 or in a mini PC case. This mainboard is equipped with a CIX CP8180 ARM chipset, which is also found inside the <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Minisforum-releases-new-MS-R1-mini-PC-with-powerful-CIX-CP8180-ARM-chipset-and-up-to-64-GB-of-RAM.1159513.0.html" target="_self">Minisforum MS-R1</a>. This processor has a total of eight ARM Cortex-A720 performance cores, the two fastest can hit boost clock speeds of up to 2.6 GHz. Moreover, there are four Cortex-A520 efficiency cores.</p></div><div data-csc-images="1" data-csc-cols="1" id="c15113126"><figure><a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/fileadmin/Notebooks/News/_nc5/ARM_Framework-Laptop-13.jpg" title="The mainboard can be installed in the Framework Laptop 13 or a mini PC case (Image source: MetaComputing)" data-caption="The mainboard can be installed in the Framework Laptop 13 or a mini PC case (Image source: MetaComputing)"><picture><source srcset="https://www.notebookcheck.net/fileadmin/_processed_/webp/Notebooks/News/_nc5/ARM_Framework-Laptop-13-q82-w738-h.webp 1x, https://www.notebookcheck.net/fileadmin/_processed_/webp/Notebooks/News/_nc5/ARM_Framework-Laptop-13-q82-w1476-h.webp 2x"><img src="https://www.notebookcheck.net/fileadmin/_processed_/7/7/csm_ARM_Framework-Laptop-13_a5d48e595b.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="The mainboard can be installed in the Framework Laptop 13 or a mini PC case (Image source: MetaComputing)"></picture></a><figcaption>The mainboard can be installed in the Framework Laptop 13 or a mini PC case (Image source: MetaComputing)</figcaption></figure></div><div id="c15113125"><p>Additionally, there’s an ARM Immortalis-G720 GPU with ten cores and an AI accelerator with a performance of 30 TOPS. This chipset is likely slower than the Snapdragon X Elite or a current flagship smartphone chip, but it should still provide enough performance for many everyday tasks. Either way, this mainboard upgrade might only be interesting for developers for the most part, because <a href="https://www.cnx-software.com/2025/11/11/500-minisforum-ms-r1-arm-linux-ai-mini-pc-features-cix-cp8180-12-core-soc-up-to-64gb-lpddr5x/" target="_blank">early tests</a> show that the SoC already draws about 16 watts at idle, which means battery life will likely be fairly short when combined with the 55Wh battery of the Framework Laptop 13.
</p>
<h2>Price and availability</h2>
<p>The MetaComputing ARM AI PC Kit is available now at the manufacturer’s <a href="https://metacomputing.io/products/metacomputing-arm-aipc" target="_blank">official online shop</a>. The base model with 16GB RAM, 1TB SSD and a mini PC case costs $549. The mainboard can be installed in a previously purchased Framework Laptop 13. Users who don’t own a Framework Laptop can order a bundle including the notebook for $999. MetaComputing charges an additional $100 for 32GB RAM.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/5-december-2025-outage/">https://blog.cloudflare.com/5-december-2025-outage/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46162656">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post"><article><p>2025-12-05</p><section><p>5 min read</p><img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5NoiDo8eH6E6bTJYfEqoe9/60cbcc5d7d59e4c68a99a22026d221d8/image2.png" alt=""><div><p>On December 5, 2025, at 08:47 UTC (all times in this blog are UTC), a portion of Cloudflare’s network began experiencing significant failures. The incident was resolved at 09:12 (~25 minutes total impact), when all services were fully restored.</p><p>A subset of customers were impacted, accounting for approximately 28% of all HTTP traffic served by Cloudflare. Several factors needed to combine for an individual customer to be affected as described below.</p><p>The issue was not caused, directly or indirectly, by a cyber attack on Cloudflare’s systems or malicious activity of any kind. Instead, it was triggered by changes being made to our body parsing logic while attempting to detect and mitigate an industry-wide vulnerability <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/waf-rules-react-vulnerability/"><u>disclosed this week</u></a> in React Server Components.</p><p>Any outage of our systems is unacceptable, and we know we have let the Internet down again following the incident on November 18. We will be publishing details next week about the work we are doing to stop these types of incidents from occurring.</p>
    <p>
      <h3 id="what-happened">What happened</h3>
      
    </p>
    <p>The graph below shows HTTP 500 errors served by our network during the incident timeframe (red line at the bottom), compared to unaffected total Cloudflare traffic (green line at the top).</p>
          <figure>
          <img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/43yFyHQhKjhPoLh4yB7pQ8/c1eb08a3e056530311e6056ecac522ed/image1.png" alt="500 error codes served by Cloudflare’s network during the incident" width="1999" height="955" loading="lazy">
          </figure><p>Cloudflare's Web Application Firewall (WAF) provides customers with protection against malicious payloads, allowing them to be detected and blocked. To do this, Cloudflare’s proxy buffers HTTP request body content in memory for analysis. Before today, the buffer size was set to 128KB.</p><p>As part of our ongoing work to protect customers using React against a critical vulnerability, <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-55182"><u>CVE-2025-55182</u></a>, we started rolling out an increase to our buffer size to 1MB, the default limit allowed by Next.js applications. We wanted to make sure as many customers as possible were protected.</p><p>This change was being rolled out using our gradual deployment system, and, as part of this rollout, we identified an increase in errors in one of our internal tools which we use to test and improve new WAF rules. As this was an internal tool, and the fix being rolled out was a security improvement, we decided to disable the tool for the time being as it was not required to serve or protect customer traffic.</p><p>Disabling this was done using our global configuration system. This system does not use gradual rollouts but rather propagates changes within seconds to the entire network and is under review <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/18-november-2025-outage/"><u>following the outage we recently experienced on November 18</u></a>.</p><p>In our FL1 version of our proxy under certain circumstances, this latter change caused an error state that resulted in 500 HTTP error codes to be served from our network.</p><p>As soon as the change propagated to our network, code execution in our FL1 proxy reached a bug in our rules module which led to the following LUA exception:</p>
            <pre><code>[lua] Failed to run module rulesets callback late_routing: /usr/local/nginx-fl/lua/modules/init.lua:314: attempt to index field 'execute' (a nil value)</code></pre>
            <p>resulting in HTTP code 500 errors being issued.</p><p>The issue was identified shortly after the change was applied, and was reverted at 09:12, after which all traffic was served correctly.</p><p>Customers that have their web assets served by our older FL1 proxy <b>AND</b> had the Cloudflare Managed Ruleset deployed were impacted. All requests for websites in this state returned an HTTP 500 error, with the small exception of some test endpoints such as <code>/cdn-cgi/trace</code>.</p><p>Customers that did not have the configuration above applied were not impacted. Customer traffic served by our China network was also not impacted.</p>
    <p>
      <h3 id="the-runtime-error">The runtime error</h3>
      
    </p>
    <p>Cloudflare’s rulesets system consists of sets of rules which are evaluated for each request entering our system. A rule consists of a filter, which selects some traffic, and an action which applies an effect to that traffic. Typical actions are “<code>block</code>”, “<code>log</code>”, or “<code>skip</code>”. Another type of action is “<code>execute</code>”, which is used to trigger evaluation of another ruleset.</p><p>Our internal logging system uses this feature to evaluate new rules before we make them available to the public. A top level ruleset will execute another ruleset containing test rules. It was these test rules that we were attempting to disable.</p><p>We have a killswitch subsystem as part of the rulesets system which is intended to allow a rule which is misbehaving to be disabled quickly. This killswitch system receives information from our global configuration system mentioned in the prior sections. We have used this killswitch system on a number of occasions in the past to mitigate incidents and have a well-defined Standard Operating Procedure, which was followed in this incident.</p><p>However, we have never before applied a killswitch to a rule with an action of “<code>execute</code>”. When the killswitch was applied, the code correctly skipped the evaluation of the execute action, and didn’t evaluate the sub-ruleset pointed to by it. However, an error was then encountered while processing the overall results of evaluating the ruleset:</p>
            <pre><code>if rule_result.action == "execute" then
  rule_result.execute.results = ruleset_results[tonumber(rule_result.execute.results_index)]
end</code></pre>
            <p>This code expects that, if the ruleset has action=”execute”, the “rule_result.execute” object will exist. However, because the rule had been skipped, the rule_result.execute object did not exist, and Lua returned an error due to attempting to look up a value in a nil value.</p><p>This is a straightforward error in the code, which had existed undetected for many years. This type of code error is prevented by languages with strong type systems. In our replacement for this code in our new FL2 proxy, which is written in Rust, the error did not occur.</p>
    <p>
      <h3 id="what-about-the-changes-being-made-after-the-incident-on-november-18-2025">What about the changes being made after the incident on November 18, 2025?</h3>
      
    </p>
    <p>We made an unrelated change that caused a similar, <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/18-november-2025-outage/"><u>longer availability incident</u></a> two weeks ago on November 18, 2025. In both cases, a deployment to help mitigate a security issue for our customers propagated to our entire network and led to errors for nearly all of our customer base.</p><p>We have spoken directly with hundreds of customers following that incident and shared our plans to make changes to prevent single updates from causing widespread impact like this. We believe these changes would have helped prevent the impact of today’s incident but, unfortunately, we have not finished deploying them yet.</p><p>We know it is disappointing that this work has not been completed yet. It remains our first priority across the organization. In particular, the projects outlined below should help contain the impact of these kinds of changes:</p><ul><li><p><b>Enhanced Rollouts &amp; Versioning</b>: Similar to how we slowly deploy software with strict health validation, data used for rapid threat response and general configuration needs to have the same safety and blast mitigation features. This includes health validation and quick rollback capabilities among other things.</p></li><li><p><b>Streamlined break glass capabilities:</b> Ensure that critical operations can still be achieved in the face of additional types of failures. This applies to internal services as well as all standard methods of interaction with the Cloudflare control plane used by all Cloudflare customers.</p></li><li><p><b>"Fail-Open" Error Handling: </b>As part of the resilience effort, we are replacing the incorrectly applied hard-fail logic across all critical Cloudflare data-plane components. If a configuration file is corrupt or out-of-range (e.g., exceeding feature caps), the system will log the error and default to a known-good state or pass traffic without scoring, rather than dropping requests. Some services will likely give the customer the option to fail open or closed in certain scenarios. This will include drift-prevention capabilities to ensure this is enforced continuously.</p></li></ul><p>Before the end of next week we will publish a detailed breakdown of all the resiliency projects underway, including the ones listed above. While that work is underway, we are locking down all changes to our network in order to ensure we have better mitigation and rollback systems before we begin again.</p><p>These kinds of incidents, and how closely they are clustered together, are not acceptable for a network like ours. On behalf of the team at Cloudflare we want to apologize for the impact and pain this has caused again to our customers and the Internet as a whole.</p>

In a retraction notice dated Friday, November 28, the journal <a href="https://doi.org/10.1006/rtph.1999.1371" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Nouvelle fenêtre"><em>Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology</em></a> announced that the study, published in April 2000 and concluding the herbicide was safe, has been removed from its archives. The disavowal comes 25 years after publication and eight years after thousands of internal Monsanto documents were made public during US court proceedings (the "Monsanto Papers"), revealing that the actual authors of the article were not the listed scientists – Gary M. Williams (New York Medical College), Robert Kroes (Ritox, Utrecht University, Netherlands), and Ian C. Munro (Intertek Cantox, Canada) – but rather Monsanto employees.</p>                 <p>Known as "ghostwriting," this practice is considered a form of scientific fraud. It involves companies paying researchers to sign their names to research articles they did not write. The motivation is clear: When a study supports the safety of a pesticide or drug, it appears far more credible if not authored by scientists employed by the company marketing the product.</p>         <p><strong>You have 73.89% of this article left to read.

On one specific project, we had a market need to get some Windows-only modules running on Linux, and rather than&nbsp;cross-compiling, another team had simply copied &amp; pasted a few hundred thousand lines of code, swapping Windows-specific components for Linux-specific.</p><p>For the non-technical reader, this is an enormous problem because now two versions of the code exist.&nbsp; So, all features &amp; bug fixes must be solved in two separate codebases that will grow apart over time.&nbsp; When I heard about this, a&nbsp;young &amp; naive version of me set out to fix the situation....</p><p><b>Tech debt projects are always a hard sell to management, because even if everything goes flawlessly, the code just does roughly what it did before.</b>&nbsp; This project was no exception, and the optics weren't great.&nbsp; I did as many engineers do and "ignored the politics", put my head down, and got it done.&nbsp; But, the project went long, and I lost a lot of clout in the process.</p><p>I realized I was essentially trying to solve a <i>people</i> problem with a <i>technical</i> solution.&nbsp; Most of the developers at this company were happy doing the same thing today that they did yesterday...and five years ago.&nbsp; As <a href="https://andrewharmellaw.github.io/" target="_blank">Andrew Harmel-Law</a>&nbsp;points out, code tends to follow the personalities of the people that wrote it.&nbsp; The code was calcified because the developers were also.&nbsp; Personality types who dislike change tend not to design their code with future change in mind.</p><p><b>Most technical problems are really people problems.</b>&nbsp; Think about it.&nbsp; Why does technical debt exist?&nbsp; Because requirements weren't properly clarified before work began.&nbsp; Because a salesperson promised an unrealistic deadline to a customer.&nbsp; Because a developer chose an outdated technology because it was comfortable.&nbsp; Because management was too reactive and cancelled a project mid-flight.&nbsp; Because someone's ego wouldn't let them see a better way of doing things.</p><p>The core issue with the project was that admitting the need for refactoring was also to admit that the way the company was building software was broken and that individual skillsets were sorely out of date.&nbsp; My small team was trying to fix one module of many, while other developers were writing code as they had been for decades.&nbsp;&nbsp;I had one developer openly tell me, "I don't want to learn anything new."&nbsp; I realized that <b>you'll never clean up tech debt faster than others create it.</b>&nbsp; It is like triage in an emergency room, <b>you must stop the bleeding first</b>, then you can fix whatever is broken.</p><h2>An Ideal World&nbsp;</h2><p>The project also disabused me of the engineer's ideal of a world in which engineering problems can be solved in a vacuum - staying out of "politics" and letting the work speak for itself - a world where deadlines don't exist...and let's be honest, neither do customers.&nbsp; This ideal world rarely exists.&nbsp; The vast majority of projects have non-technical stakeholders, and telling them "just trust me; we're working on it" doesn't cut it.&nbsp; I realized that <b>the&nbsp;<i>perception</i>&nbsp;that your team is getting a lot done is just as important as getting a lot done.</b></p><p>Non-technical people do not intuitively understand the level of effort required or the need for tech debt cleanup; it must be communicated effectively by engineering - in both initial estimates &amp; project updates.&nbsp; Unless leadership has an engineering background, the value of the technical debt work likely needs to be <i>quantified</i>&nbsp;and shown as <i>business</i> value.</p><h2>Heads Up&nbsp;</h2><p>Perhaps these are the lessons that prep one for more senior positions.&nbsp; In my opinion, anyone above senior engineer level needs to know how to collaborate cross-functionally, regardless of whether they choose a technical or management track.&nbsp; Schools teach Computer Science, not navigating personalities, egos, and personal blindspots.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I have worked with some incredible engineers, better than myself - the type that have deep technical knowledge on just about any technology you bring up.&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was younger, I wanted to be that engineer -&nbsp;the "engineer's engineer".&nbsp; But I realize now, that is not my personality.&nbsp; I'm too ADD for that. :)</p><p>For all of their (considerable) strengths, more often than not, those engineers shy away from the interpersonal.&nbsp; The 
tragedy is that they are incredibly productive ICs, but may fail
 with bigger initiatives because they are only one person - a single 
processor core can only go so fast.&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps equally valuable is the "heads <i>up</i> coder" - the person who is deeply technical, but also able to pick their head up &amp; see project risks coming (technical &amp; otherwise) and steer the team around them.</p>

    <div>
            <p>I don't like RSS readers. I know, this is blasphemous especially on a website where I'm actively encouraging you to subscribe through RSS. As someone writing stuff, RSS is great for me. I don't have to think about it, the requests are pretty light weight, I don't need to think about your personal data or what client you are using. So as a <em>protocol</em> RSS is great, no notes. </p><p>However as something I'm going to consume, it's frankly <em>a giant chore</em>. I feel pressured by RSS readers, where there is this endlessly growing backlog of things I haven't read. I rarely want to read all of a websites content from beginning to end, instead I like to jump between them. I also don't really care if the content is chronological, like an old post about something interesting isn't less compelling to me than a newer post. </p><p>What I want, as a user experience, is something akin to TikTok. The whole appeal of TikTok, for those who haven't wasted hours of their lives on it, is that I get served content based on an algorithm that determines what I might think is useful or fun. However what I would like is to go through content from random small websites. I want to sit somewhere and passively consume random small creators content, then upvote some of that content and the service should show that more often to other users. That's it. No advertising, no collecting tons of user data about me, just a very simple "I have 15 minutes to kill before the next meeting, show me some random stuff."</p><p>In this case the "algorithm" is pretty simple: if more people like a thing, more people see it. But with Google on its way to replacing search results with LLM generated content, I just wanted to have something that let me play around with the small web the way that I used to. </p><p>There actually used to be a service like this called StumbleUpon which was more focused on pushing users towards popular sites. It has been taken down, presumably because there was no money in a browser plugin that sent users to other websites whose advertising you didn't control. </p><h3 id="tldr">TL;DR </h3><p>You can go download the Firefox extension now and try this out and skip the rest of this if you want. <a href="https://timewasterpro.xyz/">https://timewasterpro.xyz/</a> If you hate it or find problems, let me know on Mastodon. <a href="https://c.im/@matdevdug">https://c.im/@matdevdug</a></p><h3 id="functionality">Functionality </h3><p>So I wanted to do something pretty basic. You hit a button, get served a new website. If you like the website, upvote it, otherwise downvote it. If you think it has objectionable content then hit report. You have to make an account (because I couldn't think of another way to do it) and then if you submit links and other people like it, you climb a Leaderboard. </p><p>On the backend I want to (very slowly so I don't cost anyone a bunch of money) crawl a bunch of RSS feeds, stick the pages in a database and then serve them up to users. Then I want to track what sites get upvotes and return those more often to other users so that "high quality" content shows up more often. "High quality" would be defined by the community or just me if I'm the only user. </p><p>It's pretty basic stuff, most of it copied from tutorials scattered around the Internet. However I <em>really</em> want to drive home to users that this is not a Serious Thing. I'm not a company, this isn't a new social media network, there are no plans to "grow" this concept beyond the original idea unless people smarter than me ping with me ideas. So I found this amazing CSS library: <a href="https://sakofchit.github.io/system.css/">https://sakofchit.github.io/system.css/</a></p><p>The Apple's System OS design from the late-80s to the early 90s was one of my personal favorites and I think would send a strong signal to a user that this is not a professional, modern service. </p><figure><img src="https://matduggan.com/content/images/2025/11/image-1.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="670" height="1138" srcset="https://matduggan.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/11/image-1.png 600w, https://matduggan.com/content/images/2025/11/image-1.png 670w"></figure><p>Great, the basic layout works. Let's move on!</p><h3 id="backend">Backend</h3><p>So I ended up doing FastAPI because it's very easy to write. I didn't want to spend a ton of time writing the API because I doubt I nailed the API design on the first round. I use sqlalchemy for the database. The basic API layout is as follows:</p><ul><li>admin - mostly just generating read-only reports of like "how many websites are there"</li><li>leaderboard - So this is my first attempt at trying to get users involved. Submit a website that other people like? Get points, climb leaderboard. </li></ul><p>The source for the RSS feeds came from the (very cool) Kagi small web Github. <a href="https://github.com/kagisearch/smallweb">https://github.com/kagisearch/smallweb</a>. Basically I assume that websites that have submitted their RSS feeds here are cool with me (very rarely) checking for new posts and adding them to my database. If you want the same thing as this does, but as an iFrame, that's the Kagi small web service. </p><p>The scraping work is straightforward. We make a background worker, they grab 5 feeds every 600 seconds, they check for new content on each feed and then wait until the 600 seconds has elapsed to grab 5 more from the smallweb list of RSS feeds. Since we have a lot of feeds, this ends up look like we're checking for new content less than once a day which is the interval that I want. </p><p>Then we write it out to a sqlite database and basically track "has this URL been reported", if so, put it into a review queue and then how many times this URL has been liked or disliked. I considered a "real" database but honestly sqlite is getting more and more scalable every day and its impossible to beat the immediate start up and functionality. Plus very easy to back up to encrypted object storage which is super nice for a hobby project where you might wipe the prod database at any moment. </p><p>In terms of user onboarding I ended up doing the "make an account with an email, I send a link to verify the email". I actually hate this flow and I don't really want to know a users email. I never need to contact you and there's not a lot associated with your account, which makes this especially silly. I have a ton of email addresses and no real "purpose" in having them. I'd switch to Login with Apple, which is great from a security perspective but not everybody has an Apple ID. </p><p>I also did a passkey version, which worked fine but the OSS passkey handling was pretty rough still and most people seem to be using a commercial service that handled the "do you have the passkey? Great, if not, fall back to email" flow. I don't really want to do a big commercial login service for a hobby application. </p><p>Auth is a JWT, which actually was a pain and I regret doing it. I don't know why I keep reaching for JWTs, they're a bad user experience and I should stop. </p><h3 id="can-i-just-have-the-source-code">Can I just have the source code?</h3><p>I'm more than happy to release the source code once I feel like the product is in a somewhat stable shape. I'm still ripping down and rewriting relatively large chunks of it as I find weird behavior I don't like or just decide to do things a different way. </p><p>In the end it does seem to do whats on the label. We have over 600,000 individual pages indexed. </p><h3 id="so-how-is-it-to-use">So how is it to use?</h3><p>Honestly I've been pretty pleased. But there are some problems. </p><p>First I couldn't find a reliable way of switching the keyboard shortcuts to be Mac/Windows specific. I found some options for querying platform but they didn't seem to work, so I ended up just hardcoding them as Alt which is not great. </p><p>The other issue is that when you are making an extension, you spend a long time working with these manifests.json. The specific part I really wasn't sure about was: </p><pre><code>"browser_specific_settings": {
    "gecko": {
      "id": "<a href="https://matduggan.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="7d1c191014133d091410180a1c0e09180f0d0f1253050407">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>",
      "strict_min_version": "80.0",
      "data_collection_permissions": {
        "required": ["authenticationInfo"]
      }
    }
  }</code></pre><p>I'm not entirely sure if that's all I'm doing? I think so from reading the docs. </p><p>Anyway I built this mostly for me. I have no idea if anybody else will enjoy it. But if you are bored I encourage you to give it a try. It should be pretty light weight and straight-forward if you crack open the extension and look at it. I'm not loading any analytics into the extension so basically until people complain about it, I don't really know if its going well or not. </p><h3 id="future-stuff">Future stuff</h3><ul><li>I need to sort stuff into categories so that you get more stuff in genres you like. I don't 100% know how to do that, maybe there is a way to scan a website to determine the "types" of content that is on there with machine learning? I'm still looking into it. </li><li>There's a lot of junk in there. I think if we reach a certain number of downvotes I might put it into a special "queue".  </li><li>I want to ensure new users see the "best stuff" early on but there isn't enough data to determine "best vs worst". </li><li>I wish there were more independent photography and science websites. Also more crafts. That's not really a "future thing", just me putting a hope out into the universe. Non-technical beta testers get overwhelmed by technical content. </li></ul>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The asteroid Bennu continues to provide new clues to scientists’ biggest questions about the formation of the early solar system and the origins of life. As part of the ongoing study of pristine samples delivered to Earth by NASA’s OSIRIS-REx (Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, and Security-Regolith Explorer) spacecraft, three new papers published Tuesday by the journals Nature Geosciences and Nature Astronomy present remarkable discoveries: sugars essential for biology, a gum-like substance not seen before in astromaterials, and an unexpectedly high abundance of dust produced by supernova explosions.</p>
<p><strong>Sugars essential to life</strong></p>
<p>Scientists led by Yoshihiro Furukawa of Tohoku University in Japan found sugars essential for biology on Earth in the Bennu samples, detailing their findings in the journal <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41561-025-01838-6" rel="noopener">Nature Geoscience</a>. The five-carbon sugar ribose and, for the first time in an extraterrestrial sample, six-carbon glucose were found. Although these sugars are not evidence of life, their detection, along with <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasas-asteroid-bennu-sample-reveals-mix-of-lifes-ingredients/">previous detections</a> of amino acids, nucleobases, and carboxylic acids in Bennu samples, show building blocks of biological molecules were widespread throughout the solar system.</p>
<p>For life on Earth, the sugars deoxyribose and ribose are key building blocks of DNA and RNA, respectively. DNA is the primary carrier of genetic information in cells. RNA performs numerous functions, and life as we know it could not exist without it. Ribose in RNA is used in the molecule’s sugar-phosphate “backbone” that connects a string of information-carrying nucleobases.</p>
<figure>
<p>
<iframe title="Bio-Essential Sugars Discovered in Samples from Asteroid Bennu" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9LyH6jTefU8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p>
</figure>
<p>“All five nucleobases used to construct both DNA and RNA, along with phosphates, have already been found in the Bennu samples brought to Earth by OSIRIS-REx,” said Furukawa. “The new discovery of ribose means that all of the components to form the molecule RNA are present in Bennu.”</p>
<p>The discovery of ribose in asteroid samples is not a complete surprise. Ribose has previously been found in two <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/first-detection-of-sugars-in-meteorites-gives-clues-to-origin-of-life/">meteorites</a> recovered on Earth. What is important about the Bennu samples is that researchers did not find deoxyribose. If Bennu is any indication, this means ribose may have been more common than deoxyribose in environments of the early solar system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Researchers think the presence of ribose and lack of deoxyribose supports the “RNA world” hypothesis, where the first forms of life relied on RNA as the primary molecule to store information and to drive chemical reactions necessary for survival.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Present day life is based on a complex system organized primarily by three types of functional biopolymers: DNA, RNA, and proteins,” explains Furukawa. “However, early life may have been simpler. RNA is the leading candidate for the first functional biopolymer because it can store genetic information and catalyze many biological reactions.”</p>
<p>The Bennu samples also contained one of the most common forms of “food” (or energy) used by life on Earth, the sugar glucose, which is the first evidence that an important energy source for life as we know it was also present in the early solar system.</p>
<p><strong>Mysterious, ancient ‘gum’</strong></p>
<p>A second paper, in the journal <a href="http://doi.org/10.1038/s41550-025-02694-5" rel="noopener">Nature Astronomy</a> led by Scott Sandford at NASA’s Ames Research Center in California’s Silicon Valley and Zack Gainsforth of the University of California, Berkeley, reveals a gum-like material in the Bennu samples never seen before in space rocks – something that could have helped set the stage on Earth for the ingredients of life to emerge. The surprising substance was likely formed in the early days of the solar system, as Bennu’s young parent asteroid warmed.</p>
<p>Once soft and flexible, but since hardened, this ancient “space gum” consists of polymer-like materials extremely rich in nitrogen and oxygen. Such complex molecules could have provided some of the chemical precursors that helped trigger life on Earth, and finding them in the pristine samples from Bennu is important for scientists studying how life began and whether it exists beyond our planet.</p>
<div id="">
<p>Scott SandFord</p>
<p>Astrophysicist, NASA's Ames Research Center</p>
</div>
<p>Bennu’s ancestral asteroid formed from materials in the solar nebula –  the rotating cloud of gas and dust that gave rise to the solar system –  and contained a variety of minerals and ices. As the asteroid began to warm, due to natural radiation, a compound called carbamate formed through a process involving ammonia and carbon dioxide. Carbamate is water soluble, but it survived long enough to polymerize, reacting with itself and other molecules to form larger and more complex chains impervious to water. This suggests that it formed before the parent body warmed enough to become a watery environment.</p>
<p>“With this strange substance, we’re looking at, quite possibly, one of the earliest alterations of materials that occurred in this rock,” said Sandford. “On this primitive asteroid that formed in the early days of the solar system, we’re looking at events near the beginning of the beginning.”</p>
<p>Using an infrared microscope, Sandford’s team selected unusual, carbon-rich grains containing abundant nitrogen and oxygen. They then began what Sandford calls “blacksmithing at the molecular level,” using the Molecular Foundry at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) in Berkeley, California. Applying ultra-thin layers of platinum, they reinforced a particle, welded on a tungsten needle to lift the tiny grain, and shaved the fragment down using a focused beam of charged particles.</p>

<p>When the particle was a thousand times thinner than a human hair, they analyzed its composition via electron microscopy at the Molecular Foundry and X-ray spectroscopy at Berkeley Lab’s Advanced Light Source. The ALS’s high spatial resolution and sensitive X-ray beams enabled unprecedented chemical analysis.</p>
<p>“We knew we had something remarkable the instant the images started to appear on the monitor,” said Gainsforth. “It was like nothing we had ever seen, and for months we were consumed by data and theories as we attempted to understand just what it was and how it could have come into existence.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>The team conducted a slew of experiments to examine the material’s characteristics. As the details emerged, the evidence suggested the strange substance had been deposited in layers on grains of ice and minerals present in the asteroid.</p>
<p>It was also flexible – a pliable material, similar to used gum or even a soft plastic. Indeed, during their work with the samples, researchers noticed the strange material was bendy and dimpled when pressure was applied. The stuff was translucent, and exposure to radiation made it brittle, like a lawn chair left too many seasons in the sun.</p>
<p>“Looking at its chemical makeup, we see the same kinds of chemical groups that occur in polyurethane on Earth,” said Sandford, “making this material from Bennu something akin to a ‘space plastic.’”&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ancient asteroid stuff isn’t simply polyurethane, though, which is an orderly polymer. This one has more “random, hodgepodge connections and a composition of elements that differs from particle to particle,” said Sandford. But the comparison underscores the surprising nature of the organic material discovered in NASA’s asteroid samples, and the research team aims to study more of it.</p>
<p>By pursuing clues about what went on long ago, deep inside an asteroid, scientists can better understand the young solar system – revealing the precursors to and ingredients of life it already contained, and how far those raw materials may have been scattered, thanks to asteroids much like Bennu.</p>
<p><strong>Abundant supernova dust</strong></p>
<p>Another paper in the journal <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41550-025-02688-3" rel="noopener">Nature Astronomy</a>, led by Ann Nguyen of NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston, analyzed presolar grains –&nbsp;dust from stars predating our solar system – found in two different rock types in the Bennu samples to learn more about where its parent body formed and how it was altered by geologic processes. It is believed that presolar dust was generally well-mixed as our solar system formed. The samples had six-times the amount of supernova dust than any other studied astromaterial, suggesting the asteroid’s parent body formed in a region of the <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/mission/hubble/science/science-highlights/finding-planetary-construction-zones/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">protoplanetary disk</a> enriched in the dust of dying stars.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The study also reveals that, while Bennu’s parent asteroid experienced extensive alteration by fluids, there are still pockets of less-altered materials within the samples that offer insights into its origin.</p>

<p>“These fragments retain a higher abundance of organic matter and presolar silicate grains, which are known to be easily destroyed by aqueous alteration in asteroids,” said Nguyen. “Their preservation in the Bennu samples was a surprise and illustrates that some material escaped alteration in the parent body. Our study reveals the diversity of presolar materials that the parent accreted as it was forming.”</p>

<p>NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center provided overall mission management, systems engineering, and the safety and mission assurance for OSIRIS-REx. Dante Lauretta of the University of Arizona, Tucson, is the principal investigator. The university leads the science team and the mission’s science observation planning and data processing. Lockheed Martin Space in Littleton, Colorado, built the spacecraft and provided flight operations. Goddard and KinetX Aerospace were responsible for navigating the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft. Curation for OSIRIS-REx takes place at NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston. International partnerships on this mission include the OSIRIS-REx Laser Altimeter instrument from CSA (Canadian Space Agency) and asteroid sample science collaboration with JAXA’s (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency’s) Hayabusa2 mission. OSIRIS-REx is the third mission in NASA’s New Frontiers Program, managed by NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, for the agency’s Science Mission Directorate in Washington.</p>

                                        <p>KISUMU, Kenya (AP) — A high court in Kenya on Thursday declared unconstitutional sections of a seed law that prevented farmers from <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/kenya-seed-bank-agriculture-climate-b7169c77126e5c768e3c62653afbcdc1">sharing and selling indigenous seeds</a></span> in what food campaigners have called a landmark win for food security.</p><p>Farmers in Kenya could face up to two years’ imprisonment and a fine of 1 million Kenya shillings ($7,700) for sharing seeds through their community seed banks, according to a seed law signed in 2012.</p><p>Justice Rhoda Rutto on Thursday said sections of the seed law that gave government officials powers to raid seed banks and seize seeds were also unconstitutional.</p><p>The law was introduced as a measure to curb growing sale of counterfeit seeds that were causing loses in the agricultural sector and gave sole seed trading rights to licensed companies.</p><p>The case had been filed by 15 smallholder farmers, who are members of community seed banks that have been in operation for years, preserving and sharing seeds among colleagues.</p>
    
<p>A farmer, Samuel Wathome, who was among the 15, said the old farming practices had been vindicated.</p><p>“My grandmother saved seeds, and today the court has said I can do the same for my grandchildren without fear of the police or of prison,” he said.</p>



<p>Elizabeth Atieno, a food campaigner at Greenpeace Africa, called the win a “victory for our culture, our resilience, and our future.”</p><p>“By validating indigenous seeds, the court has struck a blow against the corporate capture of our food system. We can finally say that in Kenya, feeding your community with climate-resilient, locally adapted seeds is no longer a crime,” she said.</p>
    
    
    
<p>Food campaigners have in the past encouraged governments to work with farmers to preserve indigenous seeds as a way of ensuring food security by offering farmers more plant varieties.</p><p>Indigenous seeds are believed to be drought resistant and adaptable to the climate conditions of their native areas, and hence often outperform hybrid seeds.</p>
    
<p>Kenya has a national seed bank based near the capital Nairobi where indigenous seeds are stored in cold rooms, but farmers say community seed banks are equally important for variety and proximity to the farmer.</p><p>The country has faced challenges in the seed sector where counterfeit seeds were sold to farmers, leading to losses amounting to millions of shillings in a country that relies on rain-fed agriculture.</p>

   <p>The State Department is instructing its staff to reject visa applications from people who worked on fact-checking, content moderation or other activities the Trump administration considers "censorship" of Americans' speech.</p>   <p>The directive, sent in an internal memo on Tuesday, is focused on applicants for H-1B visas for highly skilled workers, which are frequently used by tech companies, among other sectors. The memo was first reported by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-administration-orders-enhanced-vetting-applicants-h-1b-visa-2025-12-04/" target="_blank">Reuters</a>; NPR also obtained a copy.</p>

   <p>"If you uncover evidence an applicant was responsible for, or complicit in, censorship or attempted censorship of protected expression in the United States, you should pursue a finding that the applicant is ineligible" for a visa, the memo says. It refers to a policy<a href="https://x.com/SecRubio/status/1927729522855600365" target="_blank"> announced by Secretary of State Marco Rubio</a> in May restricting visas from being issued to "foreign officials and persons who are complicit in censoring Americans."</p>   <p>The Trump administration has been highly <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/01/24/nx-s1-5270071/eo-weaponization" target="_blank">critical</a> of tech companies' efforts to police what people are allowed to post on their platforms and of the broader field of trust and safety, the tech industry's term for teams that focus on preventing abuse, fraud, illegal content, and other harmful behavior online.</p>

   <p>President Trump was banned from multiple social media platforms in the aftermath of his supporters' attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. While those bans have since been lifted, the president and members of his administration frequently cite that experience as evidence for their <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/11/10/1211929764/election-false-claims-social-media-cisa-trump" target="_blank">claims</a> that tech companies unfairly target conservatives — even as many tech leaders have <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/01/07/nx-s1-5251151/meta-fact-checking-mark-zuckerberg-trump" target="_blank">eased their policies</a> in the face of that <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/06/14/g-s1-4570/a-major-disinformation-research-teams-future-is-uncertain-after-political-attacks" target="_blank">backlash</a>.</p>

   <p>Tuesday's memo calls out H-1B visa applicants in particular "as many work in or have worked in the tech sector, including in social media or financial services companies involved in the suppression of protected expression."</p>   <p>It directs consular officers to "thoroughly explore" the work histories of applicants, both new and returning, by reviewing their resumes, LinkedIn profiles, and appearances in media articles for activities including combatting misinformation, disinformation or false narratives, fact-checking, content moderation, compliance, and trust and safety.</p>

   <p>"I'm alarmed that trust and safety work is being conflated with 'censorship'," said Alice Goguen Hunsberger, who has worked in trust and safety at tech companies including OpenAI and Grindr.</p>   <p>"Trust and safety is a broad practice which includes critical and life-saving work to protect children and stop CSAM [child sexual abuse material], as well as preventing fraud, scams, and sextortion. T&amp;S workers are focused on making the internet a safer and better place, not censoring just for the sake of it," she said. "Bad actors that target Americans come from all over the world and it's so important to have people who understand different languages and cultures on trust and safety teams — having global workers at tech companies in [trust and safety] absolutely keeps Americans safer."</p>   
   <p>In a statement, a State Department spokesperson who declined to give their name said the department does not comment on "allegedly leaked documents," but added: "the Administration has made clear that it defends Americans' freedom of expression against foreigners who wish to censor them. We do not support aliens coming to the United States to work as censors muzzling Americans."</p>   <p>The statement continued: "In the past, the President himself was the victim of this kind of abuse when social media companies locked his accounts. He does not want other Americans to suffer this way. Allowing foreigners to lead this type of censorship would both insult and injure the American people."</p>   <p>First Amendment experts criticized the memo's guidance as itself a potential violation of free speech rights.</p>   <p>"People who study misinformation and work on content-moderation teams aren't engaged in 'censorship'— they're engaged in activities that the First Amendment was designed to protect. This policy is incoherent and unconstitutional," said Carrie DeCell, senior staff attorney and legislative advisor at the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, in a statement.</p>   <p>Even as the administration has targeted those it claims are engaged in censoring Americans, it has also tightened its own scrutiny of <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/06/19/g-s1-73572/us-resumes-visas-foreign-students-access-social-media" target="_blank">visa applicants' online speech</a>.</p>   <p>On Wednesday, the State Department <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/News/visas-news/announcement-of-expanded-screening-and-vetting-for-h-1b-and-dependent-h-4-visa-applicants.html" target="_blank">announced</a> it would require H-1B visa applicants and their dependents to set their social media profiles to "public" so they can be reviewed by U.S. officials.</p>   <p><em>NPR's Bobby Allyn and Michele Kelemen contributed reporting.</em></p>
