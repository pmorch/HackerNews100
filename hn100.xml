        <p>Generative Adversarial Networks refer to a family of generative models that seek to discover the underlying distribution behind a certain data generating process. This distribution is discovered through an adversarial competition between a generator and a discriminator. As we saw in an earlier introductory post on GANs, the two models are trained such that the discriminator strives to distinguish between generated and true examples, while the generator seeks to confuse the discriminator by producing data that are as realistic and compelling as possible.</p>

<p>In this post, we’ll take a deep dive into the math behind GANs. My primary source of reference is <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5423-generative-adversarial-nets.pdf">Generative Adversarial Nets</a> by Ian Goodfellow, et al. It is in this paper that Goodfellow first outlined the concept of a GAN, which is why it only makes sense that we commence from the analysis of this paper. Let’s begin!</p>

<h2 id="motivating-the-loss-function">Motivating the Loss Function</h2>

<p>GAN can be seen as an interplay between two different models: the generator and the discriminator. Therefore, each model will have its own loss function. In this section, let’s try to motivate an intuitive understanding of the loss function for each.</p>

<h2 id="notation">Notation</h2>

<p>To minimize confusion, let’s define some notation that we will be using throughout this post.</p>

\[\begin{multline}
\shoveleft x:  \text{Real data} \\
\shoveleft z: \text{Latent vector} \\
\shoveleft G(z): \text{Fake data} \\
\shoveleft D(x): \text{Discriminator's evaluation of real data} \\
\shoveleft D(G(z)): \text{Discriminator's evaluation of fake data} \\
\shoveleft \text{Error}(a, b): \text{Error between } a \text{ and } b\\
\end{multline}\]

<h2 id="the-discriminator">The Discriminator</h2>

<p>The goal of the discriminator is to correctly label generated images as false and empirical data points as true. Therefore, we might consider the following to be the loss function of the discriminator:</p>

\[L_D = \text{Error}(D(x), 1) + \text{Error}(D(G(z)), 0) \tag{1}\]

<p>Here, we are using a very generic, unspecific notation for $\text{Error}$ to refer to some function that tells us the distance or the difference between the two functional parameters. (If this reminded you of something like cross entropy or Kullback-Leibler divergence, you are definitely on the right track.)</p>

<h2 id="the-generator">The Generator</h2>

<p>We can go ahead and do the same for the generator. The goal of the generator is to confuse the discriminator as much as possible such that it mislabels generated images as being true.</p>

\[L_G = \text{Error}(D(G(z)), 1) \tag{2}\]

<p>The key here is to remember that a loss function is something that we wish to minimize. In the case of the generator, it should strive to minimize the difference between 1, the label for true data, and the discriminator’s evaluation of the generated fake data.</p>

<h2 id="binary-cross-entropy">Binary Cross Entropy</h2>

<p>A common loss function that is used in binary classification problems is binary cross entropy. As a quick review, let’s remind ourselves of what the formula for cross entropy looks like:</p>

\[H(p, q) = \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p(x)}[- \log q(x)] \tag{3}\]

<p>In classification tasks, the random variable is discrete. Hence, the expectation can be expressed as a summation.</p>

\[H(p, q) = - \sum_{x \in \chi} p(x) \log q(x) \tag{4}\]

<p>We can simplify this expression even further in the case of binary cross entropy, since there are only two labels: zero and one.</p>

\[H(y, \hat{y}) = - \sum y \log(\hat{y}) + (1 - y) \log(1 - \hat{y}) \tag{5}\]

<p>This is the $\text{Error}$ function that we have been loosely using in the sections above. Binary cross entropy fulfills our objective in that it measures how different two distributions are in the context of binary classification of determining whether an input data point is true or false. Applying this to the loss functions in (1),</p>

\[L_D = - \sum_{x \in \chi, z \in \zeta} \log(D(x)) + \log(1 - D(G(z))) \tag{6}\]

<p>We can do the same for (2):</p>

\[L_G = - \sum_{z \in \zeta} \log(D(G(z)) \tag{7}\]

<p>Now we have two loss functions with which to train the generator and the discriminator! Note that, for the loss function of the generator, the loss is small if $D(G(z))$ is close to 1, since $\log(1) = 0$. This is exactly the sort of behavior we want from a loss function for the generator. It isn’t difficult to see the cogency of (6) with a similar approach.</p>

<h2 id="minor-caveats">Minor Caveats</h2>

<p>The original paper by Goodfellow presents a slightly different version of the two loss functions derived above.</p>

\[\max_D \{ \log(D(x)) + \log(1-D(G(z))) \} \tag{8}\]

<p>Essentially, the difference between (6) and (8) is the difference in sign, and whether we want to minimize or maximize a given quantity. In (6), we framed the function as a loss function to be minimized, whereas the original formulation presents it as a maximization problem, with the sign obviously flipped.</p>

<p>Then, Goodfellow proceeds by framing (8) as a min-max game, where the discriminator seeks to maximize the given quantity whereas the generator seeks to achieve the reverse. In other words,</p>

\[\min_G \max_D \{ \log(D(x)) + \log(1-D(G(z))) \} \tag{9}\]

<p>The min-max formulation is a concise one-liner that intuitively demonstrates the adversarial nature of thecompetition between the generator and the discriminator. However, in practice, we define separate loss functions for the generator and the discriminator as we have done above.  This is because the gradient of the function $y = \log x$ is steeper near $x = 0$ than that of the function $y = \log (1 - x)$, meaning that trying to maximize $\log(D(G(z)))$, or equivalently, minimizing $- \log(D(G(z)))$ is going to lead to quicker, more substantial improvements to the performance of the generator than trying to minimize $\log(1 - D(G(z)))$.</p>

<h2 id="model-optimization">Model Optimization</h2>

<p>Now that we have defined the loss functions for the generator and the discriminator, it’s time to leverage some math to solve the optimization problem, <em>i.e.</em> finding the parameters for the generator and the discriminator such that the loss functions are optimized. This corresponds to training the model in practical terms.</p>

<h2 id="training-the-discriminator">Training the Discriminator</h2>

<p>When training a GAN, we typically train one model at a time. In other words, when training the discriminator, the generator is assumed as fixed. We saw this in action in the <a href="https://jaketae.github.io/study/gan/">previous post</a> on how to build a basic GAN.</p>

<p>Let’s return back to the min-max game. The quantity of interest can be defined as a function of $G$ and $D$. Let’s call this the value function:</p>

\[V(G, D) = \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_{data}}[\log(D(x))] + \mathbb{E}_{z \sim p_z}[\log(1 - D(G(z)))] \tag{10}\]

<p>In reality, we are more interested in the distribution modeled by the generator than $p_z$. Therefore, let’s create a new variable, $y = G(z)$, and use this substitution to rewrite the value function:</p>

\[\begin{align}
V(G, D) &amp;= \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_{data}}[\log(D(x))] + \mathbb{E}_{y \sim p_g}[\log(1 - D(y))] \\ &amp;= \int_{x \in \chi} p_{data}(x) \log(D(x)) + p_g(x) \log(1 - D(x)) \, dx
\end{align} \tag{11}\]

<p>The goal of the discriminator is to maximize this value function. Through a partial derivative of $V(G, D)$ with respect to $D(x)$, we see that the optimal discriminator, denoted as $D^*(x)$, occurs when</p>

\[\frac{p_{data}(x)}{D(x)} - \frac{p_g(x)}{1 - D(x)} = 0 \tag{12}\]

<p>Rearranging (12), we get</p>

\[D^*(x) = \frac{p_{data}(x)}{p_{data}(x) + p_g(x)} \tag{12}\]

<p>And this is the condition for the optimal discriminator! Note that the formula makes intuitive sense: if some sample $x$ is highly genuine, we would expect $p_{data}(x)$ to be close to one and $p_g(x)$ to be converge to zero, in which case the optimal discriminator would assign 1 to that sample. On the other hand, for a generated sample $x = G(z)$, we expect the optimal discriminator to assign a label of zero, since $p_{data}(G(z))$ should be close to zero.</p>

<h2 id="training-the-generator">Training the Generator</h2>

<p>To train the generator, we assume the discriminator to be fixed and proceed with the analysis of the value function. Let’s first plug in the result we found above, namely (12), into the value function to see what turns out.</p>

\[\begin{align}
V(G, D^*) &amp;= \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_{data}}[\log(D^*(x))] + \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_g}[\log(1 - D^*(x))] \\ &amp;= \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_{data}} \left[ \log \frac{p_{data}(x)}{p_{data}(x) + p_g(x)} \right] + \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_g} \left[ \log \frac{p_g(x)}{p_{data}(x) + p_g(x)} \right]
\end{align} \tag{13}\]

<p>To proceed from here, we need a little bit of inspiration. Little clever tricks like these are always a joy to look at.</p>

\[\begin{align}
V(G, D^*) &amp;= \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_{data}} \left[ \log \frac{p_{data}(x)}{p_{data}(x) + p_g(x)} \right] + \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_g} \left[ \log \frac{p_g(x)}{p_{data}(x) + p_g(x)} \right] \\ &amp;= - \log 4 + \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_{data}} \left[ \log p_{data}(x) - \log \frac{p_{data}(x) + p_g(x))}{2} \right] \\ &amp; \quad+ \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_g} \left[ \log p_g(x) - \log\frac{p_{data}(x) + p_g(x))}{2} \right] 
\end{align} \tag{14}\]

<p>If you are confused, don’t worry, you aren’t the only one. Basically, what is happening is that we are exploiting the properties of logarithms to pull out a $- \log4$ that previously did not exist. In pulling out this number, we inevitably apply changes to the terms in the expectation, specifically by dividing the denominator by two.</p>

<p>Why was this necessary? The magic here is that we can now interpret the expectations as Kullback-Leibler divergence:</p>

\[V(G, D^*) = - \log 4 + D_{KL}\left(p_{data} \parallel \frac{p_{data} + p_g}{2} \right) + D_{KL}\left(p_g \parallel \frac{p_g + p_g}{2} \right) \tag{15}\]

<p>And it is here that we reencounter the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen%E2%80%93Shannon_divergence">Jensen-Shannon divergence</a>, which is defined as</p>

\[J(P,Q) = \frac{1}{2} \left( D(P \parallel R) + D(Q \parallel R) \right) \tag{16}\]

<p>where $R = \frac12(P + Q)$. This means that the expression in (15) can be expressed as a JS divergence:</p>

\[V(G, D^*) = - \log 4 + 2 \cdot D_{JS}(p_{data} \parallel p_g) \tag{15}\]

<p>The conclusion of this analysis is simple: the goal of training the generator, which is to minimize the value function $V(G, D)$, we want the JS divergence between the distribution of the data and the distribution of generated examples to be as small as possible. This conclusion certainly aligns with our intuition: we want the generator to be able to learn the underlying distribution of the data from sampled training examples. In other words, $p_g$ and $p_{data}$ should be as close to each other as possible. The optimal generator $G$ is thus one that which is able to mimic $p_{data}$ to model a compelling model distribution $p_g$.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>In this post, we took a brief tour of the math behind general adversarial networks. Since the publication of Goodfellow’s work, more GAN models have been introduced and studied by different scholars, such as the Wasserstein GAN or CycleGAN to name just a few. The underlying mathematics for these models are obviously going to be different from what we have seen today, but this is a good starting point nonetheless.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoyed reading this post. In the next post, I plan to explore the concept of Fisher information and the Fisher matrix. It is going to be another math-heavy ride with gradients and Hessians, so keep you belts fastened!</p>

<div><p>&gt; <i>Can you elaborate how the other fallacies were mis-applied</i></p><p>Sure. OP didn’t ever reject the developers’ arguments. He’s criticising their methods for activism. But, even if OP were attacking their arguments:</p><p>OP doesn’t reject the developers’ methods (remember, their arguments are never contested) because of <i>who</i> is speaking, but <i>how</i>. To the extent it could be mistaken for <i>ad hominem</i>, it would be in tone policing, but that’s not what you said and it is not true because OP was citing Apple’s language, as evidenced by the quotes.</p><p>Appeal to corporate omniscience is not a fallacy. (And OP doesn’t cite Google as evidence for their arguments, so no appeal to authority.)</p><p>Circular reasoning doesn’t apply, even to your example, because complaints not mattering doesn’t cause Google to expect them.</p><p>False dichotomy does not apply because OP never argued any dichotomy.

He didn't need the approval of some corporation to allow him to run code on his own machine, or distribute it for others to run on theirs. The code didn't have to run as an "app" in some restricted sandbox under Microsoft's OS (not that back then, DOS or Windows were even in any way locked down the way modern operating systems are). Documentation for all the "standard" hardware like video, keyboard, hard disks, etc. was openly available, so it didn't have to rely on proprietary drivers.</p><p>This is how it was at one time, and <i>what should have remained the standard today</i>, but instead it's turned into some utopian dream that those who grew up with "smart" devices can't even conceive as possible anymore.</p><p>Google has taken what became of this code, and turned it into an "open" system that is pretty much designed to track every aspect of people's lives in order to more effectively target them with psychological manipulation, which is what advertisements really are. And you're not really getting "free stuff" in return for this invasion either, since pretty much everything you buy includes a hidden "tax" that goes to support this massive industry.</p><p>"A supercomputer in everyone's pocket"? Yes, but it's not yours, nor can you even know what it does. Even the source code that is available is millions of lines that you couldn't inspect in all your lifetime. Online 24/7, with GPS tracking your every move and a microphone that listens to what you say. Every URL you visit is logged.

<div><p>The EU has lots of laws, including some that were made after the DMA.

<div><p>Good catch.  Yes, side-loading directly from the developer website isn’t going to trigger marketplace obligations.  Those obligations still exist but are the responsibility of the developer directly.</p><p>Under the CRA, smartphones are considered to be much more critical from a security standpoint and, by the end of 2027, will have to follow an enhanced set of “best practices” to be able to enjoy a presumption of conformity.  The best practices are due to be published by December of this year.  I think Google already knows that developer attestations will be on that list and want to appear proactive instead of reactive.</p><p>The point still stands - the DMA does not exist in a vacuum.

<div><p>I think there are a few main contentions:</p><p>- The requirement, unless I'm mistaken, would tie a real-world identity of the developer to an app, who may wish to keep that separate from a pseudonym they may normally release things with.</p><p>- Unwillingness to give Google PII or just not tie a particular pseudonymous identity to that PII on Google.</p><p>- It puts absolute control in Google's hands for whether any app is allowed to run on most devices. There may be concerns about the types of decisions that may arise from this, not merely from recognized malware. Certain governments may ask Google to regulate apps allowed on such devices via this approach.</p><p>- Once this globally rolls out in 2027 it will mean the audience for apps from devs who don't agree to this will shrink dramatically.

        <p>I keep hearing what a <a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/openai-training-and-inference-costs-could-reach-7bn-for-2024-ai-startup-set-to-lose-5bn-report/">cash</a> <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/wheres-the-money/">incinerator</a> <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/openai-chatgpt-pro-subscription-losing-money">AI</a> is, especially around inference. While it seems reasonable on the surface, I've often been wary of these kind of claims, so I decided to do some digging.</p>
<p>I haven't seen anyone really try to deconstruct the costs in running inference at scale and the economics really interest me.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is really napkin math. I don't have any experience at running frontier models at scale, but I do know a lot about the costs and economics of running very high throughput services on the cloud and, also, some of the absolutely crazy margins involved from the hyperscalers vs bare metal. Corrections are most welcome.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Some assumptions</h2>
<p>I'm only going to look at raw compute costs. This is obviously a complete oversimplification, but given how useful the current models are - even assuming no improvements - I want to stress test the idea that everyone is losing so much money on inference that it is completely unsustainable.</p>
<p>I've taken the cost of a single H100 at $2/hour. This is actually more than the current retail rental on demand price, and I (hope) the large AI firms are able to get these for a fraction of this price.</p>
<p><img src="https://martinalderson.com/img/Pasted%20image%2020250827193941.png" alt="H100 pricing comparison"></p>
<p>Secondly, I'm going to use the architecture of DeepSeek R1 as the baseline, 671B total params with 37B active via mixture of experts. Given this gets somewhat similar performance to Claude Sonnet 4 and GPT5 I think it's a fair assumption to make.</p>
<h2>Working Backwards: H100 Math From First Principles</h2>
<h3>Production Setup</h3>
<p>Let's start with a realistic production setup. I'm assuming a cluster of 72 H100s at $2/hour each, giving us $144/hour in total costs.</p>
<p>For production latency requirements, I'm using a batch size of 32 concurrent requests per model instance, which is more realistic than the massive batches you might see in benchmarks. With tensor parallelism across 8 GPUs per model instance, we can run 9 model instances simultaneously across our 72 GPUs.</p>
<h4>Prefill Phase (Input Processing)</h4>
<p>The H100 has about 3.35TB/s of HBM bandwidth per GPU, which becomes our limiting factor for most workloads. With 37B active parameters requiring 74GB in FP16 precision, we can push through approximately 3,350GB/s ÷ 74GB = 45 forward passes per second per instance.</p>
<p>Here's the key insight: each forward pass processes ALL tokens in ALL sequences simultaneously. With our batch of 32 sequences averaging 1,000 tokens each, that's 32,000 tokens processed per forward pass. This means each instance can handle 45 passes/s × 32k tokens = 1.44 million input tokens per second. Across our 9 instances, we're looking at 13 million input tokens per second, or 46.8 billion input tokens per hour.</p>
<p>In reality, with MoE you might need to load different expert combinations for different tokens in your batch, potentially reducing throughput by 2-3x if tokens route to diverse experts. However, in practice, routing patterns often show clustering around popular experts, and modern implementations use techniques like expert parallelism and capacity factors to maintain efficiency, so the actual impact is likely closer to a 30-50% reduction rather than worst-case scenarios.</p>
<h4>Decode Phase (Output Generation)</h4>
<p>Output generation tells a completely different story. Here we're generating tokens sequentially - one token per sequence per forward pass. So our 45 forward passes per second only produce 45 × 32 = 1,440 output tokens per second per instance. Across 9 instances, that's 12,960 output tokens per second, or 46.7 million output tokens per hour.</p>
<h3>Raw Cost Per Token</h3>
<p>The asymmetry is stark: $144 ÷ 46,800M = $0.003 per million input tokens versus $144 ÷ 46.7M = $3.08 per million output tokens. That's a thousand-fold difference!</p>
<h3>When Compute Becomes the Bottleneck</h3>
<p>Our calculations assume memory bandwidth is the limiting factor, which holds true for typical workloads. But compute becomes the bottleneck in certain scenarios. With long context sequences, attention computation scales quadratically with sequence length. Very large batch sizes with more parallel attention heads can also shift you to being compute bound.</p>
<p>Once you hit 128k+ context lengths, the attention matrix becomes massive and you shift from memory-bound to compute-bound operation. This can increase costs by 2-10x for very long contexts.</p>
<p>This explains some interesting product decisions. Claude Code artificially limits context to 200k  tokens - not just for performance, but to keep inference in the cheap memory-bound regime and avoid expensive compute-bound long-context scenarios. This is also why providers charge extra for 200k+ context windows - the economics fundamentally change.</p>
<h2>Real-World User Economics</h2>
<p>So to summarise, I suspect the following is the case based on trying to reverse engineer the costs (and again, keep in mind this is retail rental prices for H100s):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Input processing is essentially free</strong> (~$0.001 per million tokens)</li>
<li><strong>Output generation has real costs</strong> (~$3 per million tokens)</li>
</ul>
<p>These costs map to what DeepInfra charges for R1 hosting, with the exception there is a much higher markup on input tokens.</p>
<p><img src="https://martinalderson.com/img/Pasted%20image%2020250827200246.png" alt="DeepInfra R1 pricing"></p>
<h3>A. Consumer Plans</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>$20/month ChatGPT Pro user</strong>: Heavy daily usage but token-limited
<ul>
<li>100k toks/day</li>
<li>Assuming 70% input/30% output: actual cost ~$3/month</li>
<li>5-6x markup for OpenAI</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is your typical power user who's using the model daily for writing, coding, and general queries. The economics here are solid.</p>
<h3>B. Developer Usage</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Claude Code Max 5 user</strong> ($100/month): 2 hours/day heavy coding
<ul>
<li>~2M input tokens, ~30k output tokens/day</li>
<li>Heavy input token usage (cheap parallel processing) + minimal output</li>
<li>Actual cost: ~$4.92/month → 20.3x markup</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Claude Code Max 10 user</strong> ($200/month): 6 hours/day very heavy usage
<ul>
<li>~10M input tokens, ~100k output tokens/day</li>
<li>Huge number of input tokens but relatively few generated tokens</li>
<li>Actual cost: ~$16.89/month → 11.8x markup</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The developer use case is where the economics really shine. Coding agents like Claude Code naturally have a hugely asymmetric usage pattern - they input entire codebases, documentation, stack traces, multiple files, and extensive context (cheap input tokens) but only need relatively small outputs like code snippets or explanations. This plays perfectly into the cost structure where input is nearly free but output is expensive.</p>
<h3>C. API Profit Margins</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Current API pricing</strong>: $3/15 per million tokens vs ~$0.01/3 actual costs</li>
<li><strong>Margins</strong>: 80-95%+ gross margins</li>
</ul>
<p>The API business is essentially a money printer. The gross margins here are software-like, not infrastructure-like.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>We've made a lot of assumptions in this analysis, and some probably aren't right. But even if you assume we're off by a factor of 3, the economics still look highly profitable. The raw compute costs, even at retail H100 pricing, suggest that AI inference isn't the unsustainable money pit that many claim it to be.</p>
<p>The key insight that most people miss is just how dramatically cheaper input processing is compared to output generation. We're talking about a thousand-fold cost difference - input tokens at roughly $0.005 per million versus output tokens at $3+ per million.</p>
<p>This cost asymmetry explains why certain use cases are incredibly profitable while others might struggle. Heavy readers - applications that consume massive amounts of context but generate minimal output - operate in an almost free tier for compute costs. Conversational agents, coding assistants processing entire codebases, document analysis tools, and research applications all benefit enormously from this dynamic.</p>
<p>Video generation represents the complete opposite extreme of this cost structure. A video model might take a simple text prompt as input - maybe 50 tokens - but needs to generate millions of tokens representing each frame. The economics become brutal when you're generating massive outputs from minimal inputs, which explains why video generation remains so expensive and why these services either charge premium prices or limit usage heavily.</p>
<p>The "AI is unsustainably expensive" narrative may be serving incumbent interests more than reflecting economic reality. When established players emphasize massive costs and technical complexity, it discourages competition and investment in alternatives. But if our calculations are even remotely accurate, especially for input-heavy workloads, the barriers to profitable AI inference may be much lower than commonly believed.</p>
<p>Let's not hype the costs up so much that people overlook the raw economics. I feel everyone fell for this a decade or two ago with cloud computing costs from the hyperscalers and allowed them to become money printers. If we're not careful we'll end up with the same on AI inference.</p>

<h3>What's changing?</h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Starting August 28th, Bitnami will be archiving its OCI registry of charts and images to a new location, Bitnami Legacy, to make room for the new secure, hardened images that will eventually reside in the main Bitnami registry. Users who are currently pulling these images will need to update their pipelines, internal mirrors, and Kubernetes clusters to pull from a new location before that time. A couple of options users have:&nbsp;</span><b></b></p>
<ol>

<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><span>Switch to <a href="https://bitnami.com/">Bitnami Secure Images</a>&nbsp;</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><span>Switch to the Bitnami Legacy Registry</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr"><span>To retain existing functionality and maintain continuity of systems relying on Bitnami, we recommend switching to Bitnami Secure Images. In addition to a less disruptive transition, BSI helps strengthen your security and compliance posture by adopting the higher-quality images offered as part of BSI.&nbsp;</span><span></span><span></span></p>

<h3>Switching to Bitnami Secure Images (BSI)</h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span>While some BSI images will be free, they are only for use in development/testing purposes, and a commercial subscription is recommended for access to the entire catalog, as well as stable tags, long-term support versions, and more.&nbsp;</span><b></b></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Though a BSI subscription provides customers with the entire Bitnami Debian-based image catalog (which will continue to receive updates), we recommend users upgrade and start using the hardened Photon Linux-based images instead. These are designed to be replacement images for any of the Debian images and work with the same Helm charts.&nbsp;</span><b></b></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The Photon images provide many other benefits not previously available to users of Debian images, including:&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3>Switching to Bitnami Legacy Registry</h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Another option for users of Bitnami today is to switch to the historic archive registry called Bitnami Legacy. This is unsupported software that is being made available, at users' own risk, while they make plans for alternatives. As such, this is a temporary solution, and we do not plan to keep this registry around for long. It will quickly begin to accumulate vulnerabilities that are not patched and atrophy as any software frozen in time does. If this is your choice, </span><span>we strongly recommend copying the images you are using to your own registry; again, this should be considered a temporary solution. </span><span>While we think there are many better options to make before the August 28th change, this is an option of last resort for those who need more time.&nbsp;</span><span></span></p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span>Why is it a good time to consider upgrading your security and compliance for open source?&nbsp;</span></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span>So why do all the work now to change what’s maybe been working and update the type of open source images you use? We get it, no one likes change. But the reality is the landscape of open source is changing all around us. For example, from 2019-2023, the number of malicious packages discovered has risen to more than 245,000 according to Sonatype. That’s 2x all the previous years combined. The implication is that bad actors are finding increasing opportunities to exploit open source software that is running in every major software organization around the world. Meanwhile, with the growth of AI and MCP models, open source consumption is only going to increase. So the risk profile tides are quickly rising around us, and having a better boat to be prepared for the impacts of this change is the only responsible response.&nbsp;</span><span><b></b></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>In addition, the </span><a href="https://www.european-cyber-resilience-act.com/#:~:text=The%20Cyber%20Resilience%20Act%20is,throughout%20a%20product's%20life%20cycle." target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Cyber Resilience Act in the EU</span></a><span> creates an impending obligation for many organizations doing business there to provide guarantees about the open source software they use in their organization. It could soon be a liability to use open source that doesn’t have the required documentation to prove it’s been sourced from a safe place and hasn’t been tampered with.&nbsp;</span><span><b></b></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>This is why the launch of Bitnami Secure Images is so timely. BSI is making it easier than ever for organizations to responsibly prepare for what the future of open source software in our modern world looks like. As with many things, what started out simple has become increasingly complex and requires more care to navigate. Furthermore, BSI has one of the lowest TCOs in the industry, enabling more organizations than ever before to afford cutting-edge supply chain security. BSI is effectively democratizing security and compliance for open source so that it doesn’t require million-dollar contracts from vendors with sky-high valuations.&nbsp;</span><span></span></p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span>What are Competitors trying to claim about Bitnami?&nbsp;</span></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span>It’s also a great time for the competition to try and steer the narrative about Bitnami. Some have claimed that Bitnami is “pulling their free container images and Helm charts from public access”. However, if we look a little more closely at the changes Bitnami has announced, this statement is inaccurate. For one, Bitnami Helm charts continue to be an open source project, under Apache 2, freely available to the public on GitHub.&nbsp;</span><b></b></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Second, what is actually changing is the built OCI artifacts. Essentially, Bitnami has been the Jenkins of the internet for many years, but this has become unsustainable. Operating a build pipeline and OCI registry for the general public is very expensive. Just ask those same competitors throwing shade at Bitnami why they have never offered to make their charts or images publicly available at the same scale Bitnami has?</span><b></b></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>So users can continue to freely access the Helm chart source (as well as the Debian images). However, in order to sustain and support the dedicated team of engineers who maintain and build new charts and images, a subscription will be required if an organization needs the images and charts built and hosted in an OCI registry for them. And to reiterate the above again, organizations that choose this path are simultaneously upgrading their security posture and improving their OSS strategy.</span><span></span></p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span>How do the changes on August 28th work?</span></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The changes to the Bitnami repo are slated to begin on Aug 28th. They will not all be at once. Over a multi-week period, the images will be cleaned up from the registry to make room for the new ones. This is being done gradually to minimize the disruptions. However, we can’t be precise about which image will be removed at what time due to the complexity of the 84TB of OCI content that the engineering team will be dealing with. Therefore, it’s best to assume starting Aug 28th, every image used in a key business function should be addressed with an alternate registry.&nbsp;</span><span><b></b></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>We’re making room in the mainline Bitnami registry so we can populate it with the free tier of Bitnami Secure Images. These hardened Photon have the same names as the Debian images, so they can’t occupy the same registry. And we want new adopters of Bitnami to start with the secure images going forward, as we believe this is the future of open-source software on the internet. In </span><a href="https://github.com/bitnami/charts/issues/35164" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>this FAQ</span></a>,<span> you can find more information about all the details of the upcoming changes.</span></p>

<h2 id="about">About<a href="#about" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>This document tracks existing procedures or proposals for integrating and
validating TLS/HTTPS certificates for Onion Services.</p>
<p>While some depends on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority">Certificate Authorities</a> (CA) model, others rely on
alternative certification and validation procedures that does not require
built-in certificate chains in the client software or reliance on financial
transactions.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a href="#introduction" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Whenever you browse the internet regularly, the connection between your
computer and a service is usually encrypted, and the safety of this
communication happens through the verification of a special type of
certificate.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://onionservices.torproject.org/technology/">Onion Services</a>, the connection is peer-to-peer encrypted by default,
which means that no additional certificates are needed.</p>
<p>But as the web and other internet technologies mature, certificates are
starting to be a requirement in order to unleash functionalities, especially in
web browsers, such as the faster connection protocol <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2">HTTP/2</a> and payment
processing.</p>
<p>That's why it's important to improve the certificate ecosystem to fully support
<a href="https://onionservices.torproject.org/technology/">Onion Services</a>.</p>
<p>This is a hard problem, and an ongoing effort, but there has been some
important work done to solve this.</p>
<p>The most relevant one should bring automation to the process of issuing
certificates for Onion Services, through an enhancement in a protocol called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_Certificate_Management_Environment">ACME</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="#acme-for-onions">ACME for Onions</a> proposal is composed of tools and also
an <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-misell-acme-onion/">Internet Draft</a>, which hopefully will turn into an
Internet Standard soon.</p>
<p>We are also looking into other, non-conflicting alternatives that can also be
used for certification, so service operators can decide which one fits best their
use case.</p>
<p>Improving the certificate functionality will put Onion Services in parity
with the modern stack of web development.</p>
<h2 id="benefits">Benefits<a href="#benefits" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>It may be argued that Onion Services connections are already
<em>self-authenticated</em> -- since the public key and the URL are tied together and
the connection is peer-to-peer encrypted --, and thus making the need for HTTPS
pointless, or at most giving only an impression on users of additional security.</p>
<p>But having valid HTTPS connection in Onion Services could enable many other
enhancements, such as:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Some browser features are available only with HTTPS, like <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Secure_Contexts">Secure
   Contexts</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP">Content Security Policy</a> (CSP), <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies#security">Secure cookies</a>,
   <a href="https://w3c.github.io/webauthn/">WebAuthn</a>, <a href="https://webrtc.org/">WebRTC</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PaymentRequest">PaymentRequest</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A user may be using a browser that isn't the Tor browser.  For
   example on iOS there is only Safari, and in such cases the browser
   will not be aware of the different semantics of security for an onion
   site, and won't allow the use of secure browser features (such as
   secure cookies). This limits the kind of web apps people can develop
   on onionsites as many modern browser APIs mentioned above.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allows for the usage of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2">HTTP/2</a>, since some browsers only support it if
   on HTTPS<sup id="fnref:http3-availability"><a href="#fn:http3-availability">1</a></sup>. In the future, HTTP2 and HTTP3 may only
   work with TLS, and thus valid certificates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2023-April/014833.html">It also opens up new opportunities such as payment processing</a>, <em>"as current
   PCI DSS requirements do not allow non-standard TLS"</em><sup id="fnref:pci-dss-tls"><a href="#fn:pci-dss-tls">2</a></sup> and may
   only work with certificates having some sort of validation<sup id="fnref:pci-dss-self-signed"><a href="#fn:pci-dss-self-signed">3</a></sup>.
   Payments card networks require HTTPS for a payment to be taken. So if
   someone wants to do that over an onion site they would need a TLS
   certificate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It could be argued that this is also security-in-depth by having yet another
   layer of encryption atop of other existing encryption layers. Even if the
   theoretical gain in terms of interception and tampering resistance is not
   relevant, it would still allow for service operators to split their encryption
   keys in different servers -- like one with the Onion Service keys and a backend
   having the TLS keys, thus making a compromise in one of the servers exposing
   only the cryptographic material of one of the communication layers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Tor daemon that hosts the onion site might not be the final
   computer in the chain. In larger organizations, deployment concerns
   may result in plain HTTP traveling across their network from the Tor
   daemon to the final web server. Having HTTPs protects those hops in
   the chain. This is something that distributed setups may need. The same
   could be said for a web browser using Tor SOCKS proxy somewhere else on the
   network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Non-web based applications, such as IMAP/POP/SMTP etc. can benefit
   from certificates being valid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is simply too much software that isn't aware of onionsites,
   and trying to force HTTP-over-Onion to be as secure as HTTPS-over-TCP
   creates a compatibility mess of things which do and don't know about
   the semantics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is value in exposing the existence of an onion site via <a href="https://certificate.transparency.dev/">CT
   Logs</a>. If someone navigates to the plain web version of a site, and is
   presented with a certificate containing a Subject Alternative Name (SAN) for
   both the plain web and the onion site that provides a strong cryptographic
   guarantee that they are the same site. Effectively this would replace the
   Onion-Location header with something more authenticated<sup id="fnref:non-ct-logs"><a href="#fn:non-ct-logs">4</a></sup>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The following discussion is not yet conclusive, and the problem space may be
hard to solve.</p>

<p>The Appendix B of the <a href="https://cabforum.org/working-groups/server/baseline-requirements/documents/CA-Browser-Forum-TLS-BR-2.0.7.pdf">CA/B Baseline Requirements</a> (current <a href="https://github.com/cabforum/servercert/blob/main/docs/BR.md">repository
version</a>) for the Issuance and Management of Publicly‐Trusted Certificates
(since Version 1.7.4, released in 2021) establishes two validation methods to ensure
that someone request the certificate really control a given .onion address:</p>
<ol>
<li>An "Agreed‑Upon Change to Website" (manually or via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_Certificate_Management_Environment">ACME</a>), where the
   service operator must include some secret, such as at the
   <code>/.well-known/pki-validation</code> of the site.</li>
<li>TLS <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8737.html">using ALPN</a>.</li>
<li>Checking of a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) signed by the Onion Service
   private key and containing an specific cryptographic nonce (i.e, a shared
   secret to be used only once), like using the <a href="https://github.com/HARICA-official/onion-csr">onion-csr</a> tool.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that both methods does not require that operators disclose the location of
the Onion Service, nor them need to have a regular site for the service using
DNS. Validation can either happen by accessing directly the Onion Service or
by using the service private key to sign a CSR.</p>
<p>But still commercial CAs (or financial institution) may still collect
identifiable information during the purchase of the certificates.</p>
<h2 id="acme-for-onion-ca-validated">ACME for .onion (CA-validated)<a href="#acme-for-onion-ca-validated" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>In general, getting certificates from CAs supporting the <a href="https://cabforum.org/working-groups/server/baseline-requirements/documents/CA-Browser-Forum-TLS-BR-2.0.7.pdf">CA/B Baseline
Requirements</a> for .onion addresses is still a manual, or in the best-case
scenario, semi-automated task.</p>
<p>The Automatic Certificate Management Environment (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_Certificate_Management_Environment">ACME</a>) standard (<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8555">RFC
8555</a>) solves part of the automation problem, and with the arrival of
<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc9799">RFC 9799</a> it also supports methods for validating Onion Services.</p>
<p>Having support for .onion address in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_Certificate_Management_Environment">ACME</a> standard is the first step

<h2 id="self-signed-certificates">Self-signed certificates<a href="#self-signed-certificates" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>This proposal basically consists in allowing the use of self-signed
certificates with Onion Services:</p>
<ol>
<li>For web applications like the <a href="https://tb-manual.torproject.org/">Tor Browser</a>, this would consist
   in <a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/applications/tor-browser/-/issues/13410">disabling self-signed certificate warnings when visiting .onion
   sites</a>. As an alternative, there's also the <a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/team/-/wikis/Meetings/2024/Lisbon/self-auth-certs-for-onion-services">Self-authenticating TLS
   Certificates for Onion Services using a PKCS#11 module</a> discussed
   below and relying on <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/pkcs11">PKCS#11 modules</a> or <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5280#section-4.2.2.1">Authority Information Access
   (AIA)</a> extensions, which could handle self-signed certificates matching
   the Onion Service address without the need to merge this logic directly in
   the applications, as it would remain decoupled in a PKCS#11 module, thus
   being easier to maintain.</li>
<li>For other applications -- like the <a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/applications/vpn/">TorVPN</a> and third-party software --,
   this would probably require patches or documentation instructing users to
   accept non-CA signed certificates when accessing Onion Services, which is
   very hard to provide and to maintain for a wide ranging of tools.</li>
</ol>
<div>
<p>Supported key types</p>
<p>In this proposal, any key types supported by applications could be used.</p>
<p>In case of popular web browsers, the <a href="https://cabforum.org/working-groups/server/baseline-requirements/documents/CA-Browser-Forum-TLS-BR-2.0.7.pdf">CA/B Baseline Requirements</a>
must be taken into account, which as of 2024-09 only allows for
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)">RSA</a> or <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/ecdsa-the-digital-signature-algorithm-of-a-better-internet/">ECDSA</a> keys.</p>
<p>It could also be possible to use self-signed certs using <a href="http://ed25519.cr.yp.to/">Ed25519</a>,
which is discussed below and currently not widely supported by
browsers.</p>
</div>
<p>This proposal <em>would not provide</em>:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>A self-authentication mechanism</em> (since the certificate is self-signed).
   This have a huge weight since an important piece of security provided
   by HTTPS is not just end-to-end encryption but also authentication.</li>
</ol>
<p>Supporting self-signed certificates with Onion Services has a huge gain,
but also introduces an authentication complexity. That's why proper UI
indicators and hints are needed:</p>
<ol>
<li>For the encryption state of the site (HTTP and various HTTPS situations).</li>
<li>For the authentication state of the site, telling how it was (not)
   authenticated.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are already sketches for <a href="https://onionservices.torproject.org/research/scenarios/certificates/">different scenarios</a> for how various user
interface hints and indicators could exist for <a href="https://tb-manual.torproject.org/">Tor Browser</a> and other software
maintained by Tor, as well as existing certificate proposals that can change
the certificate landscape for Onion Services in the future, which could be
adopted by operators instead of relying on self-signed certs.</p>
<p>But all these enhancements would still limit the practical application domain
of this proposal, since it would be readily available only to a small set
of applications like <a href="https://tb-manual.torproject.org/">Tor Browser</a>, except if by pursuing some standardization
such as the <a href="#same-origin-onion-certificates-sooc">SOOC</a> proposal below.</p>
<h2 id="self-signed-x509-from-onion-self-signed-by-the-onion-address">Self-signed X.509 from .onion (self-signed by the .onion address)<a href="#self-signed-x509-from-onion-self-signed-by-the-onion-address" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Another option for having HTTPS in Onion Services that may be available in the
future is to use Onion Service key pair to self-validate an HTTPS certificate
using <a href="http://ed25519.cr.yp.to/">Ed25519</a> directly:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/ahf/onion-x509">Onion x509</a> is an example in how a CA self-signed by an .onion could
  be constructed.</li>
<li>There's also a ticket requesting to <a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/applications/tor-browser/-/issues/18696">add support for self-signed HTTPS onion
  sites derived from onion service's ed25519 key</a> in the <a href="https://tb-manual.torproject.org/">Tor Browser</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>For an overview of <a href="http://ed25519.cr.yp.to/">Ed25519</a>, check <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/warner/2011/11/29/ed25519-keys/">How do Ed5519 keys work?</a>. For details

for how it implements at the Onion Services level).</p>
<p>This proposal has the advantage to not rely on Certificate Authorities, but the
disadvantage that needs additional logic both server and client side to make it
work, since a CA would needed to be installed for every visited Onion Service
using this scheme.</p>

<p>It's important to note that the current (as of 2024-09) Onion Services v3
specification does not allow the Master Onion Service identity key to be used
for purposes other than generating blinded signing keys (see Section 1.9 from
the <a href="https://spec.torproject.org/rend-spec-v3">rend-spec-v3</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Master (hidden service) identity key -- A master signing key pair
  used as the identity for a hidden service.  This key is long

<p>Also, while <a href="https://ianix.com/pub/ed25519-deployment.html#ed25519-tls">many TLS libraries support the Ed25519 signing scheme</a> used for
certificates (like in <a href="https://blog.pinterjann.is/ed25519-certificates.html">OpenSSL since version 1.1.1</a>), <a href="https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/236931/whats-the-deal-with-x25519-support-in-chrome-firefox">major web browsers

<p>In summary, implementing this proposal would require pushing at least two
specification changes:</p>
<ol>
<li>A ballot with CA/B Forum about including <a href="http://ed25519.cr.yp.to/">Ed25519</a> support.</li>
<li>An update in the Onion Services v3 spec, allowing the Onion Service identity
   keys to either:<ol>
<li>Also act as Certificate Authority root keys for the service.</li>
<li>Derive long-term (1 year) blinded keys to be used as a Certificate
   Authority for the service, maybe using the same approach described by
   Appendix A (<code>[KEYBLIND]</code>) from <a href="https://spec.torproject.org/rend-spec-v3">rend-spec-v3</a> but covering the needed
   use case of a long-term key, i.e, depending in a long-term nonce and not in
   <code>[TIME-PERIODS]</code>.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It's also important to avoid using the Onion Service key directly as the HTTPS
certificate. That would:</p>
<ul>
<li>Expose the Onion Service secret key material to more software than it's
  needed, like a web server.</li>
<li>Make it very difficult to manage offline Onion Service master keys.</li>
</ul>
<p>Instead, it's better to use the Onion Service key pair to act as a CA that then
certifies a separate key pair to be used with HTTPS.</p>
<p>Similar to the self-signed certificate proposal, this approach would have
limited adoption if only as small number of applications implement it -- such
as the <a href="https://tb-manual.torproject.org/">Tor Browser</a> --, except if endorsed by many stakeholders in the form of a
specification -- like the SOOC proposal discussed below.</p>
<h2 id="self-authenticating-tls-certificates-for-onion-services-using-a-pkcs11-module">Self-authenticating TLS Certificates for Onion Services using a PKCS#11 module<a href="#self-authenticating-tls-certificates-for-onion-services-using-a-pkcs11-module" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/team/-/wikis/Meetings/2024/Lisbon/self-auth-certs-for-onion-services">Self-authenticating TLS Certificates for Onion Services using a PKCS#11
module</a> proposal mentioned above, that relies on <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/pkcs11">PKCS#11 modules</a> or
<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5280#section-4.2.2.1">Authority Information Access (AIA)</a> extensions, could also be used to work
with a X.509 certificate directly derived from the .onion key pair.</p>
<p>But contrary to the previous proposal, it would not need to use <a href="http://ed25519.cr.yp.to/">Ed25519</a>: it
would support a signature scheme where an <a href="http://ed25519.cr.yp.to/">Ed25519</a> private key could sign an
<a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/ecdsa-the-digital-signature-algorithm-of-a-better-internet/">ECDSA</a> key. This <a href="http://ed25519.cr.yp.to/">Ed25519</a> signature could either be created using the .onion
private key itself or a fresh <a href="http://ed25519.cr.yp.to/">Ed25519</a> subkey, thus avoiding key reuse.</p>
<p>Advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Would reduce logic in the Tor Browser by a well-established API.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does not need to use <a href="http://ed25519.cr.yp.to/">Ed25519</a> X.509 certificates: can work with <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/ecdsa-the-digital-signature-algorithm-of-a-better-internet/">ECDSA</a>
  which are fully supported by major browsers according to the
  <a href="https://cabforum.org/working-groups/server/baseline-requirements/documents/CA-Browser-Forum-TLS-BR-2.0.7.pdf">CA/B Baseline Requirements</a>, and maybe could even work with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)">RSA</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seems future-proof as <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/pkcs11">PKCS#11 modules</a> are widely used.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No reliance on the CA-model (and hence has increased censorship resistance).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No need to use <a href="https://certificate.transparency.dev/">CT Logs</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Could be used by other browsers as well (such as Brave).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Could be used with any software, library or Operating System with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKCS_11">PKCS#11</a>
  support.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Disadvantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In the short-to-mid term this would not be supported on OpenSSL
  (as of 2024-09, support <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/pkcs11">PKCS#11 modules</a> is still underway).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>System-wide support would depend on how each Operating System could support
  this custom module. So could be hard to add this to <a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/applications/vpn/">TorVPN</a>. But anyway,
  <a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/applications/vpn/">TorVPN</a> can't validate existing self-signed .onion certs either, as
  of 2024-09.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Operators currently using self-signed certs would need to migrate to new
  certificates.</p>

<h2 id="same-origin-onion-certificates-sooc">Same Origin Onion Certificates (SOOC)<a href="#same-origin-onion-certificates-sooc" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/alecmuffett/onion-dv-certificate-proposal">Same Origin Onion Certificates</a> (SOOC) proposal aims to specify when "in
very limited circumstances, we shall not care about signatures at all",
allowing clients to <a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/applications/tor-browser/-/issues/13410">disable self-signed certificate warnings when visiting
.onion sites</a>.</p>
<p>The main difference between the SOOC proposal and to simply start allowing
self-signed certificates is that SOOC is aimed to be an IETF proposal that
could gain momentum and hence have a greater chance to be adopt by many
different vendors.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xE5eaDMiOKphDxijK9tfIWHUB-h-fTG8tb3laofXLSc/edit#heading=h.dphbi0rss5tj">the SOOC document</a> for details.</p>
<h2 id="dane-for-onion">DANE for .onion<a href="#dane-for-onion" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Another option is to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS-based_Authentication_of_Named_Entities">DNS-based Authentication of Named Entities</a> (DANE),
with DNS records like this to associate an Onion Service address with a given
HTTPS certificate's public key hash:</p>
<pre><code>_443._tcp.testk4ae7qr6nhlgahvyicxy7nsrmfmhigtdophufo3vumisvop2gryd.onion. TSLA 3 1 1 AB9BEB9919729F3239AF08214C1EF6CCA52D2DBAE788BB5BE834C13911292ED9
</code></pre>
<p>In order for that to work, logic should be implemented in the client software.</p>
<p>Drawbacks:</p>
<ol>
<li>Service operators must update this record whenever a new certificate is issued.</li>
<li>Has some <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6698#appendix-A.2.1.3">limits for wildcard certificates on specific ports</a>.</li>
<li>DANE is not widely supported, especially by web browsers.</li>
<li>It would only work for service operators willing to publish the .onion address in the DNS.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="onion-only-cas">Onion-only CAs<a href="#onion-only-cas" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>This proposal consists of:</p>
<ol>
<li>Having .onion-only CAs with name constraints (only allowing issuance for
   .onion). Services available both via DNS-based and .onion domains will need
   to have two TLS certificates in order to use this approach -- one certificate
   for the DNS-based domain (as usual) and another only for the .onion address.</li>
<li>Certification procedure would be automated, so generated .onion addresses
   could easily have it's certificates issued by this special type of CA.</li>
<li>Certification would then happen by checking a signature in a CSR and
   comparing the Subject Alternative Name (SAN). Signature must be validated by
   the .onion address in the SAN.</li>
<li>So this type of CA would be mainly a basic notary that attests signatures and
   issues a corresponding certificate.</li>
<li>The name constraint for this type of CA ensures that it only issues
   certificates for .onion domains.</li>
</ol>
<p>Security considerations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Suppose there's a malicious or bugged CA of this type that issues a
   certificate containing a SAN for <code>$address1.onion</code> but:<ol>
<li>Without checking whether the CSR has a signature made by
   <code>$address1.onion</code>'s private key.</li>
<li>Or if allowing that another, unrelated <code>$address2.onion</code> actually signs
   this CSR.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Even if that's the case, i.e, the CA wrongly issued a certificate for
   <code>$address1.onion</code> that did not match the requirements, this certificate
   won't work in practice, since in a successful Onion Service TLS connection
   to <code>$address1.onion</code> the following must happen:<ol>
<li>The underlying Tor Rendezvous connection should ensure that the
   client is connected to <code>$address1.onion</code> (Onion Services connections
   are self-authenticated by the .onion address).</li>
<li>The Onion Service should then offer it's TLS certificate, which would
   not be the malicious one (except if the service is already compromised,
   but in that case the attacker would not need to forge an invalid certificate
   anyway...).</li>
<li>Then the client's TLS library tests whether the certificate chain can be
   verified and any SAN in the presented certificate matches <code>$address1.onion</code>,
   among other checks (such as expiration).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>That said, the work done by this special type of CA is only to <em>expand the
  self-authentication property</em> from the .onion address into a certificate. So
<em>the attack surface of this special type of CA may be inherently low</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Implementation considerations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Since <a href="http://ed25519.cr.yp.to/">Ed25519</a> certificates probably won't be supported by major
  browsers/clients in the foreseeable future (see discussion above at the
  <a href="#self-signed-x509-from-onion-self-signed-by-the-onion-address">Self-signed X.509 for .onion</a> section), issuance should probably follow the
  Appendix B of the <a href="https://cabforum.org/working-groups/server/baseline-requirements/documents/CA-Browser-Forum-TLS-BR-2.0.7.pdf">CA/B Baseline Requirements</a>.</li>
<li>The entire certification procedure could happen via Onion Services.</li>
<li>Actually the whole CA infrastructure (website, APIs, OCSP etc) could be
  interacted only via Onion Services, to reduce the attack surface and protect
  the service location.</li>
<li>Important to consider whether would be possible to organizations setup and
  maintain a Onion-only CA that's as most automated as possible, including root
  certificate packaging/distribution/rotation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ol>
<li>Easy to implement on the client side (just need to install the CA).</li>
<li>Easy to implement and maintain on Tor-native applications such as Tor
   Browser and the Tor VPN.</li>
<li>Possibly lowest attack surface than with regular CAs!</li>
<li>Largest certification expiration dates could be used (like one year).</li>
</ol>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Might not be easy to find CAs willing to do this, or to a new one to be
   formed for this purpose.</li>
<li>Might need a merge request to include this method in the <a href="https://cabforum.org/working-groups/server/baseline-requirements/documents/CA-Browser-Forum-TLS-BR-2.0.7.pdf">CA/B Baseline
   Requirements</a>, if wider acceptance is intended.</li>
<li>No guarantees that these special CAs would be installed among all clients
   and libraries.</li>
<li>Need additional security analysis.</li>
</ol>
<p>Open questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Need to check if <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_revocation_list">Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs)</a> are needed,
   and how to handle it.</li>
<li>Need to figure out how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_Certificate_Status_Protocol">OCSP</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCSP_stapling">OCSP Stapling</a> could happen. OSCP
   connection could be available behind an Onion Service.</li>
<li>Does sending certificates to <a href="https://certificate.transparency.dev/">CT Logs</a> still makes sense for this special
   type of certification?</li>
<li>Needs built-in DoS/service abuse protection:<ul>
<li>An idea for that: implement a simple PoW by additionally requiring that
  service operators provide a proof-ownership of another .onion address
  made by an specific vanity address (like limited to 5 or 6 chars).</li>

<p dir="auto">bookmarks.txt is a concept of keeping bookmarks in plain text files.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Principals</h2><a id="user-content-principals" aria-label="Permalink: Principals" href="#principals"></a></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Bookmarked URLs are stored in files named <code>bookmarks.txt</code>. The format is described below.</li>
<li>A "global" bookmarks file is located in the home directory (<code>$HOME/bookmarks.txt</code>).</li>
<li>"Local" bookmarks files could exist in different directories as well.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Format</h2><a id="user-content-format" aria-label="Permalink: Format" href="#format"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">URLs are stored one per line and could be accompanied with optional titles. Titles are separated from URLs with one space character.</p>

<p dir="auto">Examples:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">a URL without any title</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="https://www.example.com
-----------------------
^
URL"><pre><code>https://www.example.com
-----------------------
^
URL
</code></pre></div>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">a URL with a title</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="https://sul.im personal website
-------------- ----------------
^              ^
URL            Optional title"><pre><code>https://sul.im personal website
-------------- ----------------
^              ^
URL            Optional title
</code></pre></div>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Tools</h2><a id="user-content-tools" aria-label="Permalink: Tools" href="#tools"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The plain text nature of bookmark files allows to use any program to manage URLs. The <code>bin/</code> directory of this repository contains <code>bookmarks</code> script that could be used to list existing and add new URLs. However nothing should stop you from building your own tools.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Usage</h2><a id="user-content-usage" aria-label="Permalink: Usage" href="#usage"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Use <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf">fzf</a> to select a URL and open it in the default browser:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="./bin/bookmarks | fzf | cut -d ' ' -f 1 | xargs open"><pre><span>./bin/bookmarks | fzf | cut -d ' ' -f 1 | xargs open</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Add a new URL:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="./bin/bookmarks https://github.com/soulim/bookmarks.txt"><pre><span>./bin/bookmarks https://github.com/soulim/bookmarks.txt</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">This is how I use bookmarks.txt:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>$HOME/bookmarks.txt</code> contains URLs useful in any context. These are "global" addresses.</li>
<li>Each project directory has "local" <code>bookmarks.txt</code> files with URLs pointing to tools specific to each project (repositories, monitoring tools, dashboards, and so on).</li>
<li>A symbolic link <code>$HOME/bin/bookmarks</code> point to <code>bin/bookmarks</code> from this directory.</li>
<li>With help of <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf">fzf</a> I have a nice menu with fuzzy search to select URLs and open them automatically.</li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Register recently published a story titled <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/27/popular_nodejs_utility_used_by/">Putin on the code: DoD reportedly relies on utility written by Russian dev</a>. They should be ashamed of this story. This poor open source developer is getting beat up now to score some internet points. It’s very upsetting.</p>
<p>But anyway, let’s look at some receipts.</p>
<p>If you’re not real smrt, it seems like pointing out an open source project is written by one person in a country you don’t like is a bad thing. It could be. But it also could be the software running THE WHOLE F*CKING PLANET is written by one person. In a country. But we have no idea which country. It’s not the same person mind you, but it’s one person.</p>
<p>Here’s the thing. Almost all open source is literally one person. What I mean by that is if you look at all the open source projects out there, and there are a lot, we see a pattern of one person no matter how we slice and dice the data.</p>
<p>So let’s start with the data. A project exists called <a href="https://ecosyste.ms/">ecosyste.ms</a> that catalogs a lot of open source. Most of it I would guess, but not all. They currently have 11.8 million open source projects in their data. You would be right to think that is a big number. I’m told anything over 15 is a big number, but it probably depends how smart you are, or think you are.</p>
<p>So what do we mean by one person is open source. What I mean is if we look at all the projects that ecosyste.ms is tracking, how many have a single person maintaining that project? It’s about 7 million. This is also a big number. 7 million open source projects are one person. It’s actually bigger than that, because of the 11.8 million projects ecosyste.ms is tracking, we don’t know how many maintainers 4 million of the projects have. A bunch of those will be one person. Here’s what a graph of this looks like</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://opensourcesecurity.io/images/post-images/1-maintainer.png"></p>
<p>I clipped the graph so it looks nicer. There are projects with hundreds of maintainers. Not a ton, but they exist.</p>
<p>Now, the clever people among us are thinking “but Josh, surely these 7 million projects are all things nobody uses, the important open source we all use has loads of maintainers!!!”</p>
<p>You would be right to think that. It’s the first thought I had back when I started to look at this data. It’s OK. You’re still in the denial stage. Hopefully you’ll reach anger by the end of this post.</p>
<p>So we’re going to use the NPM ecosystem to explain this. I use NPM because they have the richest data in ecosyste.ms to explain my point. I’ve done this same thing across multiple ecosystems and the graphs all look the same.</p>
<p>So, what does the NPM maintainer graph look like.
<img loading="lazy" src="https://opensourcesecurity.io/images/post-images/1-maintainer-npm.png">
Your first thought is probably “why is the left axis green?” It’s not an axis, it’s the single maintainer number. It’s that huge compared to literally all the other data. There are just that many single person NPM projects.</p>
<p>So now, let’s look at the number of maintainers for projects with over 1 million downloads this month.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://opensourcesecurity.io/images/post-images/1-maintainer-downloads.png"></p>
<p>This time the graph shows how many downloads projects with over 1 million downloads, and one maintainer or more than one maintainer. It was easier to show the data by creating these two buckets.</p>
<p>That’s almost a 50/50 split. Think about that. About half of the 13,000 most downloaded NPM packages are ONE PERSON. We can change the download number and the graph stays this shape. It’s not until I change downloads to 1 billion downloads that we see 1 package maintained by 1 person, and 9 packages maintained by more than 1.</p>
<p>This is open source. Open source is one person, even the popular stuff.</p>
<p>I will also add, a lot of people own more than one package. So while NPM has over 4 million single person projects, they have about 900,000 maintainers for those 4 million single person projects. This will be an important data point at the end.</p>
<p>So here’s the big conclusion. If you want to make a big deal about something, maybe it shouldn’t be what country a sole maintainer is from. Let’s face it, the Russians aren’t dumb enough to backdoor a package owned by a guy living in Russia. They’re going to do something like pretend to be from another country with a name like Jia Tan, not Boris D. Badguy. This isn’t a Rocky and Bullwinkle episode.</p>
<p>Anyway, back to the conclusion</p>
<p>Open source, the thing that drives the world, the thing Harvard says has an economic value of 8.8 trillion dollars (also a big number). Most of it is one person. And I can promise you not one of those single person projects have the proper amount of resources they need. If you want to talk about possible risks to your supply chain, a single maintainer that’s grossly underpaid and overworked. That’s the risk. The country they are from is irrelevant.</p>
<p>And now if we have news stories being written about how a single person maintainer is the bad guy? That’s not cool (this is where your denial is supposed to turn into anger).</p>
<p>So what can you do about this? How can you turn your newly denial-turned-anger into action? We don’t really know unfortunately. I discussed this in a podcast episode <a href="https://opensourcesecurity.io/2025/2025-06-hobbyist-thomas-depierre/">Hobbyist Maintainers with Thomas DePierre</a>. Like many hard problems, there isn’t an easy solution. But I guarantee the solution isn’t hunting down and demonizing single maintainers.</p>

Kennedy Jr. </span></p><p>Here are the emails that each of the officials sent to their CDC colleagues by Dr. Deb Houry, Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, and Dr. Daniel Jernigan. </p><p><strong>Dr. Deb Houry, Deputy Director for Program and Science/Chief Medical Officer:</strong></p><p>“Over the past decade, I have had the honor of working for six CDC directors, from both Republican and Democratic administrations. To me, these leaders and my colleagues were not “Red” or “Blue,” but red, white, and blue—united in the shared purpose of protecting health and saving lives in our beloved country and globally. I have served during this time in various leadership roles, including as CDC’s senior-most career leader and lead for the transition as the current administration assumed office.</p><p>I’ve always been proud to be part of an institution that is committed to using science and data to drive our life-saving work and inform our messaging. We have worked tirelessly to enhance openness through public-facing data dashboards, providing real-time access to trends for conditions such as mpox, H5N1, measles, and overdose deaths, allowing the public to make informed decisions. Additionally, I have witnessed the rapid translation of science into action, with some Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Reports (MMWRs) being published within a week of an outbreak.</p><p>For the good of the nation and the world, the science at CDC should never be censored or subject to political pauses or interpretations. Vaccines save lives—this is an indisputable, well-established, scientific fact. Informed consent and shared decision-making must focus not only on the risks but also on the true, life-saving benefits that vaccines provide to individuals and communities. It is, of course, important to question, analyze, and review research and surveillance, but this must be done by experts with the right skills and experience, without bias, and considering the full weight of scientific evidence. Recently, the overstating of risks and the rise of misinformation have cost lives, as demonstrated by the highest number of U.S. measles cases in 30 years and the violent attack on our agency.</p><p>CDC must continue its work on all diseases, including noncommunicable health conditions, which include many of the leading causes of death in the US. I have seen the value of integrating these efforts with those of other CDC programs, as we did with the Zika virus. Integrating expertise from across the agency is critical to our effectiveness in addressing novel and emerging diseases. CDC has proven its value in addressing conditions like hypertension, diabetes, cancer, overdose, and mental health issues, as evidenced by the progress in reducing overdose deaths this year. However, proposed budget cuts and reorganization plans will negatively impact CDC's ability to address these conditions, worsening the nation's health.</p><p>I love this agency. Nevertheless, I have submitted my resignation today. I am committed to protecting the public’s health, but the ongoing changes prevent me from continuing in my job as a leader of the agency. This is a heartbreaking decision that I make with a heavy heart.</p><p>To the CDC staff, you are the reason I stayed and showed up each day during difficult times. I have done my best to provide support so that you can continue your critical work. Thank you for your continued commitment to our mission and the work you do every day.</p><p>As I move on to the next phase of my career, I will continue to advocate for the values that have always driven my work—science, data, and evidence-based solutions to public health challenges. I have been privileged to contribute to the CDC’s mission in many roles, including as Chief Medical Officer, and I am deeply grateful to have had the opportunity to serve alongside you.</p><p>Deb Houry, MD, MPH.”</p><p><strong>Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, Director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (two emails, one to colleagues, and a longer formal resignation):</strong></p><p>“It has been a great pleasure to serve in the role of Director of NCIRD. I wish I could say more in person, but wanted to make sure that you all have heard from me directly that I have submitted my resignation. I am not able to serve in this role any longer because of the ongoing weaponizing of public health. You are the best team I have ever worked with, and you continue to shine despite this dark cloud over the agency and our profession.</p><p>Please take care of yourself and your teams and make the right decisions for yourselves. I will send a longer email to our Center this evening or in the morning.</p><p>Demetre Daskalakis.”</p><p><em><span>And here is Dr. Daskalakis’s formal resignation letter to Dr. Houry, </span><a href="https://x.com/dr_demetre/status/1960843433473376602" rel="">posted</a><span> on X/Twitter:</span></em></p><p>“Dear Dr. Houry, I am writing to formally resign from my position as Director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), effective August 28, 2025, close of business. I am happy to stay on for two weeks to provide transition, if requested. This decision has not come easily, as I deeply value the work that the CDC does in safeguarding public health and am proud of my contributions to that critical mission. However, after much contemplation and reflection on recent developments and perspectives brought to light by Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., I find that the views he and his staff have shared challenge my ability to continue in my current role at the agency and in the service of the health of the American people. Enough is enough. While I hold immense respect for the institution and my colleagues, I believe that it is imperative to align my professional responsibilities to my system of ethics and my understanding of the science of infectious disease, immunology, and my promise to serve the American people. This step is necessary to ensure that I can contribute effectively in a capacity that allows me to remain true to my principles. I am unable to serve in an environment that treats CDC as a tool to generate policies and materials that do not reflect scientific reality and are designed to hurt rather than to improve the public’s health. The recent change in the adult and children’s immunization schedule threaten the lives of the youngest Americans and pregnant people. The data analyses that supported this decision have never been shared with CDC despite my respectful requests to HHS and other leadership. This lack of meaningful engagement was further compounded by a “frequently asked questions” document written to support the Secretary’s directive that was circulated by HHS without input from CDC subject matter experts and that cited studies that did not support the conclusions that were attributed to these authors. Having worked in local and national public health for years, I have never experienced such radical non-transparency, nor have I seen such unskilled manipulation of data to achieve a political end rather than the good of the American people. It is untenable to serve in an organization that is not afforded the opportunity to discuss decisions of scientific and public health importance released under the moniker of CDC. The lack of communication by HHS and other CDC political leadership that culminates in social media posts announcing major policy changes without prior notice demonstrate a disregard of normal communication channels and common sense. Having to retrofit analyses and policy actions to match inadequately thought-out announcements in poorly scripted videos or page long X posts should not be how organizations responsible for the health of people should function. Some examples include the announcement of the change in the COVID-19 recommendations for children and pregnant people, the firing of scientists from ACIP by X post and an op-ed rather than direct communication with these valuable experts, the announcement of new ACIP members by X before onboarding and vetting have completed, and the release of term of reference for an ACIP workgroup that ignored all feedback from career staff at CDC. The recent term of reference for the COVID vaccine work group created by this ACIP puts people of dubious intent and more dubious scientific rigor in charge of recommending vaccine policy to a director hamstrung and sidelined by an authoritarian leader. Their desire to please a political base will result in death and disability of vulnerable children and adults. Their base should be the people they serve not a political voting bloc. I have always been first to challenge scientific and public health dogma in my career and was excited by the opportunity to do so again. I was optimistic that there would be an opportunity to brief the Secretary about key topics such as measles, avian influenza, and the highly coordinated approach to the respiratory virus season. Such briefings would allow exchange of ideas and a shared path to support the vision of “Making America Healthy Again.” We are seven months into the new administration, and no CDC subject matter expert from my Center has ever briefed the Secretary. I am not sure who the Secretary is listening to, but it is quite certainly not to us. Unvetted and conflicted outside organizations seem to be the sources HHS use over the gold standard science of CDC and other reputable sources. At a hearing, Secretary Kennedy said that Americans should not take medical advice from him. To the contrary, an appropriately briefed and inquisitive Secretary should be a source of health information for the people he serves. As it stands now, I must agree with him, that he should not be considered a source of accurate information. The intentional eroding of trust in low-risk vaccines favoring natural infection and unproven remedies will bring us to a pre-vaccine era where only the strong will survive and many if not all will suffer. I believe in nutrition and exercise. I believe in making our food supply healthier, and I also believe in using vaccines to prevent death and disability. Eugenics plays prominently in the rhetoric being generated and is derivative of a legacy that good medicine and science should continue to shun. The recent shooting at CDC is not why I am resigning. My grandfather, who I am named after, stood up to fascist forces in Greece and lost his life doing so. I am resigning to make him and his legacy proud. I am resigning because of the cowardice of a leader that cannot admit that HIS and his minions’ words over decades created an environment where violence like this can occur. I reject his and his colleagues’ thoughts and prayers, and advise they direct those to people that they have not actively harmed. For decades, I have been a trusted voice for the LGBTQ community when it comes to critical health topics. I must also cite the recklessness of the administration in their efforts to erase transgender populations, cease critical domestic and international HIV programming, and terminate key research to support equity as part of my decision. Public health is not merely about the health of the individual, but it is about the health of the community, the nation, the world. The nation’s health security is at risk and is in the hands of people focusing on ideological self-interest. I want to express my heartfelt gratitude for the opportunities for growth, learning, and collaboration that I have been afforded during my time at the CDC. It has been a privilege to work alongside such dedicated professionals who are committed to improving the health and well-being of communities across the nation even when under attack from within both physically and psychologically. Thank you once again for the support and guidance I have received from you and previous CDC leadership throughout my tenure. I wish the CDC continued success in its vital mission and that HHS reverse its dangerous course to dismantle public health as a practice and as an institution. If they continue the current path, they risk our personal well-being and the security of the United States. </p><p>Sincerely, Demetre C. Daskalakis MD MPH (he/his/him)”</p><p><strong>Dr. Daniel Jernigan, National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases:</strong></p><p>Colleagues: I wanted to let you know directly that I have submitted my resignation as Director of the National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases effective tomorrow. This was a very difficult decision for me. I have had the incredible opportunity to serve the American people doing meaningful and impactful work for over 30 years.</p><p>Since 1994, I have worked at CDC with some of the most intelligent, driven, and compassionate people, working to detect, control, and prevent infectious diseases. These efforts have had significant impact mitigating illness, preventing deaths, and improving the lives of millions of people.</p><p>I believe strongly in the mission of public health and the leadership that CDC has given for almost 80 years; however, given the current context in the Department, I feel it is best for me to offer my resignation.</p><p>I am so grateful for being able to work with all of you and know that you will continue doing the highest level of science and public health.</p><p>Thanks</p><p>Dan.”</p><p><span>The news of these resignations set off a firestorm in public health circles. </span><em>This is not normal. </em><span>There had been speculation that this particular trio of leaders would resign depending on how the September meeting of Secretary Kennedy’s newly-installed CDC Advisory Commitee on Immunization Practices went. There has been mounting fear that Secretary Kennedy will attempt to link vaccines to autism in a forthcoming HHS report, and that ACIP will be expected to remove many of its recommendations, some decades old, that have protected American children from death and severe illness from preventable diseases. But news of Monarez’s ouster meant that the writing was on the wall, moving these resignations up by weeks. </span></p><p>Frankly, the very future of the CDC is unknown. Thousands of good scientists and other agency officials remain. But without these key leaders—non-partisan career officials widely respected both internally and beyond—the agency is genuinely at risk of losing its ability to carry out its core mission. That’s not because any three people, (regardless of how experienced or respected they may be) are irreplaceable, but, rather, for what their departures portend. Other leaders and career scientists may also soon exit or be forced out. At some point, core mission activities that keep us safe will be at risk of being unfulfilled. </p><p>When these losses will translate to decreased safety to Americans that is noticeable is an open question.

<h2>
Joe Gebbia has no business designing government services.
</h2>
<p>
President Trump’s appointment of AirBnB co-founder Joe Gebbia as “Chief Design Officer” of the United States is a sickening travesty. It not only proves a fundamental misunderstanding of both design and governance, but an unbound commitment to corruption.
</p>
<p>
Gebbia’s directive to make government services “as satisfying to use as the Apple Store” within three years might serve as an appealing soundbite, but it quickly collapses under the slightest scrutiny: why? how? with what design army? The creation of the so-called National Design Studio and Gebbia’s appointment as its chief should raise serious questions about credentials, institutional destruction, and continued corruption.
</p>
<h2>
Design by Regulatory Arbitrage
</h2>
<p>
Gebbia’s reputation in design rests on a shaky foundation. AirBnB’s present dominance isn’t the product of real innovation. He and his friends stumbled upon an idea after listing their apartment on Craigslist for under-the-table sublease during a popular conference. They realized money could be made, and built a website to let other people do the same thing, through them, not Craig. Good on them, but renting a space is regulated differently than selling a used couch for many good reasons. What you could once attribute to the same quaint naivety of setting up a lemonade stand, you can no longer. The people who funded them knew better, and eventually, so did they.
</p>
<p>
What AirBnB does today is no different, other than the legitimization that comes with lots of capital and a slick app. But let’s be clear: The innovation was never about design, it was about collusion: spend enough to ensure that regulatory enforcement costs more; spin enough to make theft look heroic. With Y-Combinator as a launchpad, the company rapidly built its business by systematically ignoring well-established regulations in hospitality and real estate. This sounds like a perfect match for the Trump Administration, and it’s why I cannot take any of Gebbia’s commitments now at face value. His formative business experience taught him to break existing systems rather than designing better ones, and for that he was rewarded beyond anyone’s wildest imaginations.
</p>
<p>
True design requires understanding constraints, working within complex systems, and serving users’ actual needs rather than exploiting regulatory gaps. Gebbia’s track record suggests a fundamentally different approach — one that prioritizes disruption over responsibility and profit over genuine public service. I’m not sure he can differentiate between entitlement and expertise, self and service, commerce and civics.
</p>
<h2>
Institutional Vandalism
</h2>
<p>
The hubris of this appointment becomes clearer when viewed alongside the recent dismantling of <span>18F</span>, the federal government’s existing design services office. Less than a year ago, Trump and Elon Musk’s <span>DOGE</span> initiative completely eviscerated this team, which was modeled after the <span>UK</span>’s Government Digital Service and comprised hundreds of design practitioners with deep expertise in government systems. Many of us likely knew someone at <span>18F</span>. We knew how much value they offered the country. The people in charge didn’t understand what they did and didn’t care.
</p>
<p>
In other words, we were already doing what Gebbia claims he’ll accomplish in three years. The <span>18F</span> team had years of experience navigating federal bureaucracy, understanding regulatory constraints, and working within existing governmental structures—precisely the institutional knowledge required for meaningful reform.
</p>
<p>
Now we’re expected to believe that dismantling this expertise and starting over with political appointees represents progress. Will Gebbia simply rehire the <span>18F</span> professionals who were just laid off? If so, why destroy the institutional knowledge in the first place? If not, how does beginning from scratch improve upon what already existed? It doesn’t and it won’t. This appointment has more in common with Trump’s previous appointment of his son-in-law to “solve the conflict in the Middle East,” which resulted in no such thing unless meetings about hotels and real estate counts.
</p>
<p>
Gebbia knows as much about this job as Kushner did about diplomacy, which is nothing. Despite years in “design,” I suspect Gebbia knows little of anything about it, or user experience, or public service. His expertise is in drawing attention while letting robbers in the back door.
</p>
<h2>
Impossible Promises, Probable Corruption
</h2>
<p>
The timeline alone reveals the proposal’s fundamental unseriousness. Gebbia promises to reform not just the often-cited 26,000 federal websites, but all government services—physical and digital—within three years. Anyone with experience in government systems or even just run-of-the-mill website design knows this is absurd. The <span>UK</span>’s Government Digital Service, working with a much smaller governmental structure, required over a decade to achieve significant results.
</p>
<p>
But three years is plenty of time for something else entirely: securing contracts, regulatory concessions, and other agreements that benefit private interests. Gebbia may no longer run AirBnB day-to-day, but his wealth remains tied to the company. His conspicuous emergence as a Trump supporter just before the 2024 election suggests motivations beyond public service.
</p>
<p>
Trump has consistently demonstrated his willingness to use government power to benefit his businesses and those of his collaborators. There’s a growing list of “business-minded” men granted unfettered access and authority over sweeping government initiatives under Trump who have achieved nothing other than self-enrichment. AirBnB has already disrupted hospitality; their next expansion will likely require the kind of regulatory flexibility that only comes from having allies in high government positions. Now they’ve got a man on the inside.
</p>
<h2>
The Pattern of Capture
</h2>
<p>
This appointment fits a broader pattern of regulatory capture, where industries gain control over the agencies meant to oversee them. Gebbia’s role ostensibly focuses on improving government services, but it also positions him to influence regulations that could significantly impact AirBnB’s business model and expansion plans.
</p>
<p>
The company has spent years fighting local zoning laws, housing regulations, and taxation requirements. Having a co-founder in a high-level government design role—with access to federal agencies and regulatory processes—creates obvious conflicts of interest that extend far beyond website optimization.
</p>
<h2>
Beyond Personal Grievances
</h2>
<p>
<i>Full disclosure: I attended college with Joe Gebbia and quickly formed negative impressions of his character that subsequent events have only reinforced.</i>
</p>
<p>
While personal history colors perspective, the substantive concerns about this appointment stand independently: the mismatch between promised expertise and demonstrated capabilities, the destruction of existing institutional knowledge, the unrealistic timeline claims, and the predictable potential for conflicts of interest.
</p>
<p>
Government design reform is important work that requires deep expertise, institutional knowledge, and genuine commitment to public service. It deserves leaders with proven track records in complex systems design, not entrepreneurs whose primary experience involves circumventing existing regulations for private gain.
</p>
<p>
The American people deserve government services that work better. But interacting with government could not –&nbsp;and should not — be more different from buying something at the Apple Store. One is an interface layer upon society –&nbsp;an ecosystem of its own that is irreducible to a point and inextricable from the physical and philosophical world in which it exists. The other is a store. To model one after the other is the sort of idiocy we should expect from people who either understand little to nothing about how either thing should work or just don’t care. I suspect it’s both.

<div xmlns:plos="http://plos.org"><h2>Abstract</h2><div><p>The popularity of breathwork as a therapeutic tool for psychological distress is rapidly expanding. Breathwork practices that increase ventilatory rate or depth, facilitated by music, can evoke subjective experiential states analogous to altered states of consciousness (ASCs) evoked by psychedelic substances. These states include components such as euphoria, bliss, and perceptual differences. However, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the profound subjective effects of high ventilation breathwork (HVB) remain largely unknown and unexplored. In this study, we investigated the neurobiological substrates of ASCs induced by HVB in experienced practitioners. We demonstrate that the intensity of ASCs evoked by HVB was proportional to cardiovascular sympathetic activation and to haemodynamic alterations in cerebral perfusion within clusters spanning the left operculum/posterior insula and right amygdala/anterior hippocampus; regions implicated in respiratory interoceptive representation and the processing of emotional memories, respectively. These observed regional cerebral effects may underlie pivotal mental experiences that mediate positive therapeutic outcomes of HVB.</p>

<div xmlns:plos="http://plos.org" id="section1"><h2>Introduction</h2><p>High ventilation breathwork (HVB) encompasses contemplative and therapeutic practices, including Conscious Connected Breathing or Holotropic Breathwork, in which a controlled pattern of volitional breathing increases the rate or depth of ventilation and is typically accompanied by evocative music. Despite their distinct historical roots and delivery modalities, these different HVB practices share a purported ability to elicit acute extraordinary alterations in subjective experience that closely resemble the qualia of altered states of consciousness (ASCs) induced by psychedelic substances [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref001">1</a>–<a href="#pone.0329411.ref003">3</a>]. Converging evidence demonstrates the potential value of psychedelic treatments for specific difficult-to-treat psychiatric and physiological conditions [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref004">4</a>–<a href="#pone.0329411.ref007">7</a>]. The induction of ASCs is suggested to be critical to the therapeutic action of psychedelic substances [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref008">8</a>–<a href="#pone.0329411.ref010">10</a>], for which HVB might therefore offer a non-pharmacological alternative, with fewer legal and ethical restrictions to large-scale adoption in clinical treatment. In line with this, the popularity of HVB as a therapeutic tool for psychological distress is rapidly expanding, indexed by an increased number of scientific investigations, see [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref011">11</a>,<a href="#pone.0329411.ref012">12</a>] for more details.</p>
<p>The therapeutic potential of HVB practices is suggested by a long cultural tradition of use to relieve symptoms of psychological distress [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref011">11</a>,<a href="#pone.0329411.ref013">13</a>] and by emerging preliminary evidence of clinical efficacy from controlled trials in affective and trauma-related disorders [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref014">14</a>]. Prolonged hyperventilation/HVB reportedly elicits a wide range of effects on subjective experience that include emotional and psychedelic-like phenomena (ASCs), which range from panic-like sensations to feelings of awe and dissociative symptoms [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref011">11</a>]. The 5D-ASC questionnaire is popularly used in ASC research to retrospectively assess such states [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref015">15</a>]. A key dimension of this scale is ‘Oceanic Boundlessness’ (OBN); a term coined by Freud in 1920 [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref016">16</a>] which describes a set of related feelings including ‘spiritual experience, insightfulness, blissful state, positively experienced depersonalization, and the experience of unity’ [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref017">17</a>]. OBN is considered as a defining aspect of ASCs evoked by psychedelic substances, such as psilocybin. However, the neurobiological mechanisms and subjective experience underlying ASCs induced by HVB have not been studied extensively and remain elusive.</p>
<p>First, we characterised the subjective experience of HVB to capture the nature and intensity of evoked experiential phenomena. From these data, we aimed to assess whether these effects could be reliably reproduced in controlled experimental settings in comparison to a remote – and more ecologically valid – condition. These findings informed the choice of the ASC variable, OBN, which was ultimately selected as the most widely reported experiential phenomena to identify the critical neurobiological effects of HVB.</p>
<p>Then we examined the effects of HVB performed by experienced breathwork practitioners in different experimental settings, and investigated peripheral and central neurophysiological mechanisms underpinning ASCs engendered by HVB. The neurobiological endpoints were selected based on well-characterised neurophysiological effects of hyperventilation (reviewed in [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref011">11</a>]). Hyperventilation acutely reduces regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) through interacting effects of hypocapnia, cerebral alkalosis and hypoxia, resulting in transient perturbation of neurometabolic homeostasis. Further, hyperventilation evokes allostatic changes in action-ready bodily arousal, mediated via the autonomic nervous system via the dominance of sympathetic over parasympathetic drive to the heart and blood vessels. In characterising the neurobiological effects of HVB and associated ASCs, we therefore focused our measurements on two robust indices of neurometabolic and autonomic nervous control: rCBF and heart rate variability (HRV).</p>
<p>To our knowledge, no studies have previously reported the relationship between the intensity of ASCs and changes in rCBF induced by HVB practices. Since we could not base our prediction of the regional specificity of such correlations on previous knowledge, we preferred to adopt a whole brain voxelwise exploratory approach. Also, as observations reported on the effects of psychedelics on autonomic nervous system activity have been contrasting [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref018">18</a>,<a href="#pone.0329411.ref019">19</a>], we could not make precise predictions on the direction of association between HRV and ASCs.</p>
<p>Our study was designed to address different objectives through three inter-related experiments: (please see the methods for more details), in 1) HVB was conducted over an online video-conferencing platform with a breathwork facilitator (REMOTE setting). The aim was to characterise the subjective response to remote HVB in a home setting, and inform the choice of the ASC domain to be used as subjective endpoint. In 2), we used pseudo-continuous arterial spin labelling (pCASL) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain during HVB to identify the relationship between neural haemodynamic effects of HVB and subjective measures (MRI setting). In 3) HVB was performed in a psychophysiology lab to characterise the relationship between the psychophysiological effects of HVB (autonomic alterations, see ‘psychophysiological session 3’ for more information) and subjective measures (LAB setting).</p>

<div xmlns:plos="http://plos.org" id="section2"><h2>Materials and methods</h2>
<div id="section1"><h3>Ethics statement</h3>
<p>This research was approved by the Research Governance and Ethics Committee (RGEC) in Brighton and Sussex Medical School (BSMS) as ERA/BSMS9AN4/2/2. Recruitment began on 24/11/2021 and ended on 03/03/2022. Participants provided written informed consent before participating.</p>
</div>

<div id="section2"><h3>Participants</h3>
<p>Physically and psychiatrically healthy participants aged 18–65 years old were recruited from the local area through advertisements and flyers distributed at breathwork events, in yoga/meditation centres, and on social media. Participants were eligible to take part if they had either 10 or more experiences of fast-paced breathwork or at least 6 months of any HVB practice (as defined in [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref011">11</a>]). They were screened online for eligibility and excluded if they were pregnant, currently experiencing any psychiatric condition (assessed using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) to ensure absence of DSM-V listed disorders) [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref020">20</a>]. Additional exclusion criteria included a history of epileptic seizures, panic disorder, or syncope in prior HVB, current neurological, musculoskeletal, respiratory, or cardiovascular disease, current pharmacological treatment, and contraindications to MRI.</p>
<p>Participants and were financially compensated £10 per hour for their time and up to £10 in travel expenses.</p>
</div>

<div id="section3"><h3>Breathwork modality and subjective measures</h3>
<p>HVB consisted of cyclic breathing without pausing, accompanied by progressively evocative music. This aimed to reproduce the experience of Conscious Connected Breathing, a widely adopted HVB practice typically led by a trained breathwork facilitator. In the online experimental session, instructions were provided by a breathwork facilitator (DB) who hosted the group of online participants. For the LAB and MRI setting, pre-recorded instructions by the same facilitator were delivered to participants. Specific details on breathwork instructions are presented in the supplementary index (<a href="#pone.0329411.s001">S1 Appendix</a>).</p>
</div>

<div id="section4"><h3>Questionnaires</h3>
<p>Self-reported measures were consistent across the three conditions and administered online via Qualtrics (Qualtrics, Provo, UT) [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref021">21</a>] within 30 minutes post-HVB. The selected questionnaires assessed: 1) Affect (Positive and Negative Affect Schedule – Expanded Form, PANAS-X [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref022">22</a>]); 2) Panic–like symptoms (Panic Symptoms List, PSL [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref023">23</a>]), 3) Fear and discomfort (Visual Analogue Scales (VAS) [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref024">24</a>]), and 4) Symptoms of ASCs (5-Dimensional Altered States of Consciousness Rating Scale, 5D-ASC [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref015">15</a>]).</p>
<p>Pre-session questionnaires included the VAS (scored from “0 – <em><em>no fear and discomfort”</em></em> to “100 – <em><em>complete fear and discomfort”</em></em>) [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref024">24</a>] and the PANAS-X, which measured affect using 60 items rated on a 5-point Likert scale from “<em><em>1 – very slightly or not at all</em></em>” to “<em><em>5 – extremely</em></em>” [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref025">25</a>].</p>
<p>Post-session questionnaires included the VAS and PANAS-X again, as well as the 5D-ASC, which retrospectively assessed ASCs using 94 items rated via VAS [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref017">17</a>]. Questions and responses were grouped into 3 broad subscales: oceanic boundlessness (OBN) as previously mentioned, visionary restructuralisation (VRS) to examine the effect of the HVB on vision, and Dread of Ego Dissolution (DED) which captures the anxiety-inducing effects of the experience related to the idea of the dissolution of the self [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref015">15</a>]. The PSL, a 13-item tool used to evaluate panic symptomatology, required participants to rate each item on a five-point scale from “<em><em>0 – not at all</em></em>” to “<em><em>4 – extremely severe</em></em>”.</p>
<p>The PSL and VAS for fear/discomfort were scored based on [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref024">24</a>]: a significant panic attack was indicated by an increase in VAS fear by 50 points and 4 or more items rated above mild in the PSL (mild = 2).</p>
</div>

<div id="section5"><h3>Online experimental session 1 (REMOTE)</h3>
<p>The session was conducted remotely via an online video-conferencing platform (Zoom). Preparatory information was sent to participants after screening and enrolment, including the platform link, instructions, and pre- and post-session questionnaires.</p>
<p>Participants received instructions on camera setup and were assigned personal participant numbers. They were instructed to be in a private room to avoid interruptions and to position their cameras to capture their chest and stomach for observation of full-body, continuous breaths. A breathwork facilitator remotely guided groups of participants through the 30-minute online breathwork session. Members of the research team were present online to ensure session consistency and to monitor participant engagement in HVB practice. No group experience-sharing (integration) followed the breathwork sessions to avoid memory and experience merging. Instead, participants self-integrated (processed) their session by completing retrospective questionnaires that explored the qualia of the experience within 30 minutes of concluding the session.</p>
</div>

<div id="section6"><h3>Neuroimaging experimental session 2 (MRI)</h3>
<p>Each participant in the neuroimaging session was scanned on a Siemens Prisma 3T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner fitted with a 32-channel head coil. High-resolution structural scans were obtained during rest using a 3D T1-weighted magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition gradient echo (T1 MPRAGE) sequence (repetition time (TR) = 2300 ms, echo time (TE) = 2.19 ms, flip angle = 9°, matrix = 256 × 256, voxel size = 1.0 × 1.0 × 1.0 mm3, GRAPPA acceleration factor = 2; total acquisition time (TA) = 5m 30s). Additionally, twenty control and label images were acquired per condition using a pCASL with background suppression following the parameter recommendation of the consensus paper [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref026">26</a>]: label duration = 2000ms, post-labelling delay (PLD) = 1800ms, TR = 5000 ms, TE = 14 ms, voxel size = 3.4 × 3.4 × 6.0 mm3, TA = 3m 22s), was acquired. A proton density (M<sub>0</sub>) image was acquired using the same readout and TR as the control and label images to estimate pcASL CBF.</p>
<p><a href="#pone-0329411-g001">Fig 1</a> is a schematic presentation of the MRI experimental design. Recorded instructions (see <a href="#pone.0329411.s001">S1 Appendix</a>) guided participants to breathe through three phases: BASELINE, START, and SUSTAINED HVB. BASELINE consisted of breathing at a normal rate for 20 minutes. Participants were asked to gradually increase their ventilation rate and/or depth via recorded instructions (START HVB) for approximately 6 minutes. The SUSTAINED HVB phase started after at least 5 minutes of START HVB and once end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> (EtCO<sub>2</sub>), measured via nasal cannula connected to a capnograph (MICROCAP®, Oridion Medical LTD), was stable at levels ≤20 mmHg (from a typical value of 35–40 mmHg), and was maintained for a further ~20-minutes.</p>

<p><a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0329411.g001">
              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0329411.g001</a></p></div><p>Scans were performed during BASELINE (10 minutes after the scan start), at the start of HVB (immediately after initiating HVB), and during SUSTAINED HVB (after at least 6 minutes of uninterrupted breathwork).</p>
<p>SPM12 [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref027">27</a>] and custom written Matlab (The MathWorks Inc., Natick, Massachusetts) scripts were used for image processing and statistics. Rigid-body motion correction was used to realign labelled and control images, and perfusion weighted images were calculated for the realigned control-labelled pairs by subtracting the labelled image from the control. The mean perfusion weighted images were then used to estimate CBF using the one-compartment model [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref026">26</a>] and processed to obtain partial volume-corrected [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref028">28</a>], tissue-specific (i.e., grey matter (GM) and white matter (WM)) CBF images independently. The pcASL CBF images were normalized maps in MNI space using SPM12 [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref027">27</a>]. Participants with prominent arterial transit artifacts in the CBF images, evident by the presence of strong arterial signals upon visual inspection, were excluded from the study.</p>
</div>

<div id="section7"><h3>Psychophysiological session 3 (LAB)</h3>
<p>Participants in the psychophysiology study attended the psychophysiology lab at the Trafford Centre for Medical Research at BSMS. To measure beat-to-beat heart rate (HR) and HRV (computed as the root mean square of successive differences, RMSSD) [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref029">29</a>], an electrocardiograph (Firstbeat Bodyguard 2 device) was applied to the torso [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref028">28</a>]. To measure EtCO<sub>2</sub>, the participant was fitted with a nasal cannula connected to a capnograph (MICROCAP®, Oridion Medical LTD). Following a BASELINE period during which the participant was instructed to breathe as normal to relaxing music for 10 minutes, the participant was instructed to perform HVB (see supplementary index for more information). This began as a 5-minute warm-up (START HVB) where the participant performed HVB to lower their EtCO<sub>2</sub> to ≤20 mmHg, followed by 25-minutes of HVB (SUSTAINED HVB) where EtCO<sub>2</sub> was maintained ≤20 mmHg, aided by recorded instructions from a trained breathwork facilitator. For analyses, the HVB period was defined as starting once EtCO<sub>2</sub> was stable below 20 mmHg and was subsequently recorded for 20 minutes. The recovery period began immediately after HVB was terminated, and participants resumed their normal breathing. Participants completed retrospective questionnaires within 30 minutes of the session’s conclusion.</p>

<div id="section1"><h4>Data analysis and statistics.</h4><p><strong>Objective 1:</strong> To characterize the subjective response to HVB across different settings (REMOTE, LAB, MRI), we compared affective responses (PANAS-X scores clustered into positive and negative domains), panic-like symptoms (VAS fear/discomfort and PSL) and ASCs. For the 5D-ASC, the percentage maximum score was calculated per participant and dimension [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref030">30</a>]. Data were compared across the three experiments to test for differences in self-reported effects. A linear mixed-effects model (LMM) was used to examine the effects of setting on the mean responses within each dimension of the 5D-ASC and for the PSL, accounting for subject-specific variability as a random effect using the lmer package in R; [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref031">31</a>]. We used the likelihood ratio test to compare a full model with a fixed effect of setting and a random effect of subject to a reduced model with only a random effect of subject [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref031">31</a>]. Post-hoc tests were performed using the emmeans package in R [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref032">32</a>], adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Tukey method.</p>
<p>For the PANAS-X and VAS, we used an LMM analysis to examine the effects of HVB (pre- versus post-) on setting and the type of question (positive versus negative affect for PANAS; discomfort versus fear for VAS), accounting for subject-specific variability as a random effect. We explored two-way interactions between all the variables and post-hoc tests using the same methods as the previous analyses [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref032">32</a>].</p>
<p><strong>Objective 2:</strong> In order to test the correlations between HVB-induced ASCs and rCBF effects, two contrasts between HVB time points (see MRI experimental design in <a href="#pone-0329411-g001">Fig 1</a>) were studied using paired-samples t-tests in SPM12 [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref027">27</a>]: contrast 1) between BASELINE and START HVB grey matter CBF; contrast 2) between BASELINE and SUSTAINED HVB grey matter CBF. Following this, voxel-wise maps of changes in pcASL rCBF (ΔrCBF) were calculated for the contrasts between BASELINE versus SUSTAINED HVB, and START versus SUSTAINED HVB. These ΔrCBF maps were then used for voxelwise correlation analysis with the OBN score, selected as the highest-rated 5D-ASC dimension. Voxel clusters were considered significant at a cluster-forming threshold of p &lt; 0.001, corrected for multiple comparisons using family-wise error (FWE) correction, with a significance level of p &lt; 0.05.</p>
<p><strong>Objective 3:</strong> To investigate changes in cardiac autonomic drive during HVB and their relationship to the intensity of ASCs, we calculated change in HRV (ΔRMSSD) and HR. Heartbeat timing data were imported from the Firstbeat Bodyguard device into Kubios 3.5.0 HRV scientific 4.1.0 for processing. Raw data contained substantial noise from chest movement. After an initial phase of artefact removal, interbeat interval (IBI) data were smoothed using an automatic noise detection filter at a medium threshold [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref033">33</a>]. A repeated measures ANCOVA with contrasts for different orders of an equation was conducted using HRV and OBN (5D-ASC selected from objective 1) as covariates to explain HRV variance over time, with polynomial contrast applied to identify linear and complex patterns, allowing us to characterise dynamic trends in HRV responses to HVB.</p>

<div xmlns:plos="http://plos.org" id="section3"><h2>Results</h2><p>Self-reported data from 42 participants were analysed, comprising 31 unique individuals. Study participants enrolled in one to three experimental sessions: n = 15 (age 42.9 ± 12.6 years, 5 females) for the online experimental session; n = 8 (age 41 ± 13.02 years, 2 females) for the session conducted within the psychophysiology lab; and n = 19 (age 43.7 ± 11.9; 7 females) for the MRI experimental session. There were different participants in each condition (3 repeated all conditions, 5 participants participated in 2 conditions, see <a href="#pone.0329411.s005">S1 Fig</a> for key subjective effects of repeated participants). No adverse events, including panic attacks, were reported across all experimental settings.</p>

<div id="section1"><h3>Subjective effect results</h3>
<p>Generally, measures of fear and discomfort were low in all conditions (<a href="#pone-0329411-g002">Fig 2</a>, panel C). LMM analyses identified only a significant two-way interaction between HVB and question type (fear and discomfort), with post-hoc tests showing a significant increase in discomfort post-HVB. These results indicate that perceived discomfort increased during HVB, while perceived fear remained stable across settings.</p>

<div id="section2"><h3>MRI results</h3>
<p>Datasets from 13 participants (mean age 43.7 ± 11.9; 7 female) were included in the analysis. Voxel clusters showing statistically significant CBF reductions occupied 12% and 28.5% of global grey matter volume at START and SUSTAINED HVB, respectively. Global CBF was reduced by 30.5% during START (36.2 ± 12.4 ml/100g/min) and 41.6% during SUSTAINED HVB (30.5 ± 8.5 ml/100g/min) relative to BASELINE (52.2 ± 8.2 ml/100g/min).</p>
<p>We first identified a region of cortex where HVB-evoked reduction in perfusion (ΔrCBF from BASELINE to SUSTAINED) correlated with the magnitude of ASC in the OBN dimension. This cluster encompassed left parietal operculum/posterior insula (PO/INS) (<a href="#pone-0329411-g003">Fig 3</a>). Here, rCBF in PO/INS was reduced by 7.7% during the START period of HVB (43.7 ± 10 ml/100g/min) and 18.9% during SUSTAINED HVB (38.4 ± 12.7 ml/100g/min) relative to BASELINE (52.2 ± 8.2 ml/100g/min).</p>

<div xmlns:plos="http://plos.org" id="section4"><h2>Discussion</h2><p>Our study is the first that aims to characterise the relationship between the intensity of ASCs induced by HVB practices and associated central and autonomic nervous system effects, via changes in pcASL rCBF and HRV, respectively. Our findings identified significant correlations that might indicate possible neurobiological substrates of HVB-evoked ASCs, accompanied by music. First, our findings demonstrated that the experience of HVB can be safely reproduced across different experimental settings. The pattern of self-reported experiences elicited within the MRI scanner and psychophysiology lab were analogous to those experienced at home (a more natural and comfortable environment).</p>
<p>During all experimental sessions, participants reported a trend-level reduction in ratings of fear and negative emotions. Additionally, no adverse reactions or panic attacks were experienced by any participants. However, there was a mild increase in discomfort ratings and mild panic-like symptoms were reported during the MRI session – although these were not associated to increased anxiety or panic attacks and might have been evoked by the physical constraints of being inside the MRI chamber. This experience conflicts typical breathwork practice. The observed increase in physical discomfort alongside reductions in fear and negative affect may reflect a hormetic effect, whereby transient physiological or emotional stressors promote longer-term psychological resilience [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref035">35</a>,<a href="#pone.0329411.ref036">36</a>].</p>
<p>Across participants and experimental settings, HVB reliably enhanced ASCs dominated by OBN, which is considered as a defining aspect of ASCs evoked by psychedelic substances, such as psilocybin. Although differences in OBN scores across conditions were not statistically significant, participants in the LAB condition reported noticeably higher scores compared to MRI and REMOTE sessions. This trend suggests that the in-person experience and controlled, quiet environment of the LAB may have enhanced the immersive and evocative qualities of the breathwork experience. In contrast, the MRI setting—despite also involving in-person contact —may have been less conducive due to scanner noise and physical constraints. Finally, the REMOTE condition, which involved no in-person interaction and took place in participants varied home environments, received the lowest OBN ratings. These findings point to the importance of ‘set and setting’, e.g., [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref037">37</a>], a concept well-established in psychedelic research in shaping ASCs and subjective response. These results may indicate that physical context and interpersonal presence play a critical role in breathwork outcomes.</p>
<p>Interestingly, OBN is reportedly the most accurate predictor of antidepressant actions of psychedelic substances [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref009">9</a>,<a href="#pone.0329411.ref038">38</a>–<a href="#pone.0329411.ref040">40</a>]. In the present study, the magnitude of the OBN experience induced by HVB was comparable to that elicited by serotonergic psychedelic substances, including psilocybin and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref041">41</a>,<a href="#pone.0329411.ref042">42</a>], reinforcing observations of other breathwork studies [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref001">1</a>,<a href="#pone.0329411.ref002">2</a>].</p>
<p>Fast-paced hyperventilation induces cardiovascular sympathetic activation (with relative cardiovagal parasympathetic withdrawal) and cerebral vasoconstriction, the latter is a consequence of respiratory alkalosis, resulting from reduced plasma CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sup>+</sup>, which elevates blood pH [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref043">43</a>]. Ergo, we focused our analysis on correlations between OBN and changes in HRV (for which decreases capture pro-sympathetic shifts in cardiac autonomic balance) and CBF (where regional reductions reflect cerebrovascular vasoconstriction). Importantly, decreased EtCO<sub>2</sub> is implicated as a critical factor in catalysing stronger, deeper ASCs during breathwork and may predict subacute psychological and physiological outcomes [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref002">2</a>,<a href="#pone.0329411.ref044">44</a>].</p>
<p>Our experiments identified that HVB engendered substantive time-dependent decreases in pcASL CBF. The reduction of rCBF relative to BASELINE in a cluster localized within left posterior insula and left parietal operculum predicted the intensity of OBN. This region encompasses primary interoceptive cortex and represents the state of cardiorespiratory arousal, and is consequently engaged in higher-order respiratory control. Correspondingly, neural activity here is enhanced by chemo-stimulated increases in ventilation [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref045">45</a>]. More broadly, this insular-parietal region supports the integration of somatosensory information as well as the cortical representation of afferent respiratory and bodily signals [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref046">46</a>], for example in the emergence of conscious motor intentions [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref047">47</a>]. It is also implicated in high-level integrative processes which merge external and internal stimuli [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref048">48</a>,<a href="#pone.0329411.ref049">49</a>] that contribute to a coherent, embodied representation of self [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref050">50</a>].</p>
<p>These roles are relevant to the interpretations of our finding that rCBF reductions within the PO/INS during SUSTAINED HVB predicted the intensity of self-reported OBN experience. The construct of OBN is closely related to feelings of depersonalization, sense of unity and blissful state [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref016">16</a>], and our findings align with the notion that abnormal integration of signals in the posterior insula cortex can result in abnormal body ownership. Studies on ecstatic epilepsy, a rare focal epilepsy, show that the insula is involved in ASC-like experiences, including “heightened self-awareness, mental clarity and unity with everything that exists, accompanied by a sense of bliss and physical well-being” [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref051">51</a>]. These overlap with the OBN construct, as assessed in the 5D-ASC [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref015">15</a>]. Picard and Craig [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref052">52</a>] hypothesised the involvement of the insula in the genesis of ecstatic epilepsy given its role in interoception and self-consciousness, confirmed by intracerebral electrode recordings [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref053">53</a>]. Seizures in the mesiotemporal region propagated to the dorsal anterior insula coincide with ecstatic symptoms [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref054">54</a>] and stimulation of the mid-dorsal insula region evoked experiences akin to oceanic psychedelic effects [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref055">55</a>]. The interruption of interoceptive predictive coding during anterior insula seizures may underlie the ecstatic experience, emphasizing its pivotal role in mystical and psychedelic states [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref051">51</a>,<a href="#pone.0329411.ref052">52</a>].</p>
<p>We then ran an exploratory subsequent analysis (<a href="#pone-0329411-g005">Fig 5</a>) to explore the correlations between sub-dimensions of the 11D-ASC relevant to OBN [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref017">17</a>], namely ‘disembodiment’, ‘unity’ and ‘bliss’, and CBF reductions induced by HVB relative to BASELINE. We found that scores of ‘unity’ and ‘bliss’, but not ‘disembodiment’ were associated with CBF reductions (see <a href="#pone.0329411.s002">S1</a>-<a href="#pone.0329411.s004">S3 Tables</a> for details), which concurs with the notion discussed above, specifically pointing to an involvement of the insula in the genesis of blissful feelings. Of note, 5-HT2A– targeting compounds such as psilocybin, renowned for therapeutic utility, are known to induce CBF decreases in different brain regions that correlate with the intensity of psychedelic experiences [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref056">56</a>]. Studies found reduced CBF in the insula following psilocybin administration, though it was not linked to the subjective effects assessed via the 5D-ASC [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref057">57</a>].</p>
<p>CBF reductions occur rapidly following decreased EtCO<sub>2</sub> and can be reliably detected in response to very brief periods of hyperventilation. Conversely, the profound experiential changes in emotion and thought processes tend to emerge gradually, and correspondingly psychedelic phenomenology appears contingent on the length of the breathwork session [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref058">58</a>]. Our investigation therefore compared HVB-evoked effects during late (SUSTAINED) and early (START) phases of HVB to focus specifically on the haemodynamic changes that occurred once the subjective effects had emerged. By contrasting the START and SUSTAINED phases of hyperventilation, we identified a region of right amygdala/anterior hippocampus, where the intensity of subjective experience (OBN as a covariate) positively correlated with CBF changes. Here, increased rCBF predicted the most intense OBN experience, despite the global reduction in CBF. One possible explanation is that this amygdalo-hippocampal CBF increase reflected increased regional neural activation associated with emergent expression of intense subjective effects. These regions are well established as being specialized for emotion (amygdala) and memory (hippocampus) processing. Their reciprocal interactions enable the formation of episodic representations, integrating the emotional significance and interpretation of memories [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref059">59</a>]. Interestingly, increased right amygdala blood-oxygen level-dependent responses to emotional faces in functional MRI (fMRI) have been identified in patients with treatment-resistant depression following administration of psilocybin, predictive of clinical improvements at 1 week. The authors posit that this indicates psilocybin aids individuals’ ability to confront, reappraise, and improve emotional responsiveness [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref060">60</a>]. Though speculative, these findings may indicate that HVB facilitates the processing of emotionally salient memories, which is proposed to be an essential therapeutic element in psychedelic-assisted psychotherapies [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref061">61</a>,<a href="#pone.0329411.ref062">62</a>], consistent with promising results from clinical trials of HVB applied as a therapy for patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref063">63</a>]. Our finding of increased CBF in the hippocampal region also indicates that a single session of intense hyperventilation selectively alters perfusion to the hippocampus, similar to the effects observed after 20 minutes of hypocapnia-inducing moderate exercise [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref064">64</a>]. This finding was interpreted as indicative of short-term metabolic adaptation to the high energy demands of hippocampal neurons, rather than reflecting the effects of mechanical vascular changes [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref064">64</a>].</p>
<p>HRV is a physiological index of the balance of sympathetic and parasympathetic influences on the heart. The observed reduction in HRV reflects sympathetic activation and withdrawal of parasympathetic drive [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref065">65</a>–<a href="#pone.0329411.ref067">67</a>], consistent with an action-ready state of psychophysiological engagement. As previously described, OBN characteristically entails a deeply felt positive mood linked to the experience of unity with the self and the world, and in its extreme, is experienced as a mystical or religious experience [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref017">17</a>]. Our finding that OBN ratings were related to changes in HRV over time echoes observations from other relevant modalities of ASC induction, such as self-induced cognitive trance [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref068">68</a>] or 5-HT agonists, such as LSD [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref018">18</a>,<a href="#pone.0329411.ref069">69</a>–<a href="#pone.0329411.ref071">71</a>] or N,N-Dimethyltryptamine (DMT) [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref072">72</a>,<a href="#pone.0329411.ref073">73</a>]. Nevertheless, the observed association with a positive mood contrasts the wide acceptance of reduced HRV as an index of stress and negative affective states. During HVB, the physiological state of the body exceeds typical homeostatic boundaries, and the autonomic correlates of this may reinforce a dissociative psychological state of positive affect in line with the premise of hormesis, see [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref011">11</a>] for more.</p>
<p>This exploratory work is preliminary and limited by a small sample size and a lack of an independent control condition that may, in our neuroimaging session, have prevented us from separating the contributions of haemodynamic effects secondary to CO<sub>2</sub> changes from neural activation. We also acknowledge the possibility that our whole brain voxelwise approach has led to reduced sensitivity to detect significant correlations relative to an a priori region of interest (ROI) approach. In addition, from a methodological perspective, it may be argued that the lack of control group exposed only to music may prevent dissociation of the effects of auditory stimuli (the ambient track) and the effects of HVB. Listening to upbeat music does stimulate ventilation and this should be controlled in the future. Helpful input from lived experience populations indicates that music is a powerful support to therapeutic applications of HVB. In choosing our design, we elected not to “dissect” the music component from HVB, as we preferred to consider HVB as a contemplative practice accompanied by music as a whole – and to test it in its entirety [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref074">74</a>]. Importantly, both studies [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref002">2</a>,<a href="#pone.0329411.ref075">75</a>] have dissected the effect of music and breathwork, and elucidate that music is not the main factor in triggering ASCs. This reveals that music alone is unlikely to engender significant ASCs of the magnitude reported in this research. It is also argued that the reductionist approach of breaking down a contemplative practice to dissect an “active ingredient” is less preferable than testing a practice in its entirety [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref074">74</a>]. Conjointly, psychedelic therapy sessions do not adhere to one specific psychotherapeutic model, though one consistent feature of the experience is listening to music. During psychedelic therapy sessions, patients are urged to centre their attention inwardly whilst supine and listening to a carefully selected playlist. It is suggested that music can help facilitate therapeutic experiences. As such, we are looking for CBF changes that correspond with ASCs, induced by HVB with music. We elected to proceed to treat the experience as whole, hence no control for music. More hypothesis-driven work is certainly required within the neuroscience of breathwork.</p>
<p>Furthermore, our study focused on experienced HVB practitioners and therefore our results may not be generalisable; though this is also a strength as it ensured our practitioners were able to reach the desired state without adverse outcomes. Additionally, we were unable to directly assess relevant mechanisms of therapeutic actions, as our subjective measures did not include clinical parameters relevant to traumatic memories or other forms of psychological distress. Moreover, ASCs initiated by breathwork are inherently dynamic, thus dynamic phenomenological tools, such as those employed by Lewis-Healey et al., [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref058">58</a>] may be more sensitive and informative.</p>
<p>Our imaging approach was also limited by the absence of correction for physiological noise caused by cardiac and respiratory fluctuations. This is crucial for most physiological fMRI applications for reducing signal artifacts. However, physiological fluctuations (including respiratory frequency and volume changes) can still introduce signal variations in ASL data, but we believe that our approach remains robust. Our analysis inherently averages over multiple cardiac cycles, which helps mitigate the effects of physiological noise on CBF quantification, and although respiration-induced signal changes are observed in some pcASL studies, they are largely associated with motion rather than direct vascular effects [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref076">76</a>]. This does not fully eliminate the influence of an overall increase in HR, respiratory rate, or other physiological parameters during changes in breathing conditions—factors that may also impact labelling efficiency and arterial transit times. These considerations are relevant not only to our study, but to other ASL studies where complex, interconnected factors can influence ASL signal and CBF. Practical constraints limit the extent to which additional physiological measurements can be incorporated, particularly in a study as complex as ours. These constraints include scanning time and the potential stress on participants. Furthermore, measuring CBF at the start of the SUSTAINED HVB rather than at the end or during is not ideal, yet, it may capture the physiological ‘trigger condition’ for entry into ASCs, which can continue irrespective of specific physiological threshold conditions, see [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref002">2</a>] for more.</p>
<p>A further key reason for choosing not to adopt a method of correction for EtCO<sub>2</sub> was a high risk of regressing out our primary signal of interest. One plausible mechanistic hypothesis inspiring our work is that ASCs evoked by HVB practices directly result from alterations in EtCO<sub>2</sub> and the resulting cerebral pH, causing downstream effects on neuronal function [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref011">11</a>]. Therefore, CO<sub>2</sub> related physiological signals are likely correlated with experimental effects that were the focus of our investigation, in line with recent work by others [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref002">2</a>] and regressing out these signals would severely impact our sensitivity to study the relationship between haemodynamic effects and ASCs. An additional reason is that our measures of EtCO<sub>2</sub> (collected by nasal cannula and capnograph) have been occasionally incomplete during the end of HVB sessions when EtCO<sub>2</sub> levels had reached particularly low levels, and we felt that application of correction methods using incomplete physiological data would have risked introducing major artifacts.</p>
<p>Additionally, we observed prominent arterial transit time (ATT) artifacts in 6 out of 19 participants. These artifacts were characterized by strong arterial signals in the CBF images, which led to their exclusion from the analysis. ATT artifacts can significantly impact the accuracy of perfusion measurements, as they indicate that labelled blood has not yet reached the capillary beds. To address this issue in future research, capturing blood flow dynamics at different delay times through a multi-PLD ASL protocol would reduce the impact of ATT artifacts and increase precision of assessment of cerebral perfusion.</p>

<div xmlns:plos="http://plos.org" id="section5"><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>In conclusion, our exploratory experiments suggest that circuitries supporting the integration of interoceptive representations and processing of affective memories are putative neurobiological substrates of HVB-induced ASCs. Our findings indicate directions for future research towards a better understanding of HVB and ultimately harnessing such practices for future therapeutic applications.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Within five days of ChatGPT’s release in 2022, the artificial intelligence chatbot gained more than a million users. Today, more than half of all adults under age 30 and nearly half of adults ages 30-49 say they’ve used it, according to Pew Research Center.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00238">Their work</a>, “Model Misalignment and Language Change: Traces of AI-Associated Language in Unscripted Spoken English,” is the first peer-reviewed research to analyze whether the conversational human language system is changing in the wake of the widespread adoption of chat-based large language models like ChatGPT. It was accepted into the eighth Conference on AI, Ethics, and Society, hosted by the Association for the Advancement of AI and Association for Computing Machinery, which will be held in October. The study will be published in AIES Proceedings as part of the conference.</p><div><p>“This research focuses on a central issue in the discourse surrounding AI and language: are these language changes happening because we’re using a tool and repeating what it suggested or is language changing because AI is influencing the human language system?” said assistant professor of computational linguistics and principal investigator Tom Juzek. “By analyzing lexical trends before and after ChatGPT was released in 2022, we found a convergence between human word choices and LLM-associated patterns with AI buzzwords.”</p> <p>While rapid increases in the use of certain words — like Omicron — do occur, these increases are typically due to real-world events. Recent large-scale upticks in the use of words like “delve” and “intricate” in certain fields, especially education and academic writing, are attributed to the widespread introduction of LLMs with a chat function, like ChatGPT, that overuses those buzzwords.</p> <p>“The changes we are seeing in spoken language are pretty remarkable, especially when compared to historical trends,” Juzek said. “What stands out is the breadth of change: so many words are showing notable increases over a relatively short period. Given that these are all words typically overused by AI, it seems plausible to conjecture a link.”</p> <p>Words including “surpass,” “boast,” “meticulous,” “strategically,” and “garner” have also seen considerable increases in usage since the release of ChatGPT. While these words are often used in a formal or academic tone, which makes them less common in unscripted, spoken language, researchers found that nearly three-quarters of these target words showed increased usage with some more than doubling in frequency.</p> <figure id="attachment_117600" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-117600"><img decoding="async" src="https://news.fsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chatGPTGroup.jpg" alt="" width="1613" height="1075" srcset="https://news.fsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chatGPTGroup.jpg 1613w, https://news.fsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chatGPTGroup-512x341.jpg 512w, https://news.fsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chatGPTGroup-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://news.fsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chatGPTGroup-768x512.jpg 768w, https://news.fsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chatGPTGroup-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://news.fsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chatGPTGroup-900x600.jpg 900w, https://news.fsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chatGPTGroup-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1613px) 100vw, 1613px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-117600">From left: Bryce Anderson, Riley Galpin and Tom Juzek. Photo by Devin Bittner/FSU College of Arts and Sciences.</figcaption></figure> <p>The team, including Bryce Anderson, a rising senior majoring in computer science, and Riley Galpin, a rising junior double-majoring in computer science and pure mathematics, analyzed 22.1 million words from unscripted and spontaneous spoken language including conversational podcasts on science and technology. Post-ChatGPT, researchers noted a measurable increase in the use of AI-associated buzzwords but not their synonymous counterparts. For example, the AI buzzword “underscore” saw considerable increase in usage while its synonym “accentuate” did not. <span data-teams="true">FSU researchers said this suggests we’re not just using AI; AI buzzwords are turning up in how people talk, raising concerns about a possible “seep-in effect.”</span></p> <p>“Language is the most powerful medium of communication that humanity has and understanding how AI will affect this medium is fundamentally important and timely,” said Anderson, the paper’s lead author. “My motivation to pursue this research stems from seeing AI push the limits of what’s possible in major industries and realizing that this influence isn’t just limited to tool usage — it can condition societal aspects, including how we use language.”</p> <p>This research builds upon the group’s previous research into the impact AI has on the domain of written scientific English, which revealed large-scale structural changes AI has had on scientific writing. Galpin presented the research on written language at the 38th International Florida AI Research Society Conference in May, and Anderson will join Juzek in presenting the team’s new research on spoken language at the AIES Conference in October.</p> <p>“Our research highlights many important ethical questions,” Galpin said. “With the ability of LLMs to influence human language comes larger questions about how model biases and misalignment, or differences in behavior in LLMs, may begin to influence human behaviors.”</p> <p>This research was conducted as part of FSU’s <a href="https://cre.fsu.edu/undergradresearch/urop">Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program</a>, which provides high-achieving undergraduates an opportunity to explore their research interests alongside a faculty member.</p> <p>“I look forward to future research in this area,” Juzek said. “While this is a critical development in understanding AI’s role in language change, a big open question for future work is whether AI is amplifying conventional patterns of language change or directly driving them.”</p> <p>To learn more about research conducted in the Department of Modern Languages and Linguistics, visit <a href="https://mll.fsu.edu/">mll.fsu.edu</a>.</p></div></div>]]></description>

"So a lot of fast progress there."</p><p>At the meeting, employees asked Welle and other executives about job security, "internal barriers" and Google's culture after several recent rounds of layoffs,&nbsp;<a href="https://carbon.cnbc.com/108157385" target="_blank">buyouts</a>&nbsp;and reorganizations.</p><p>Welle said the idea is to reduce bureaucracy and run the company more efficiently.</p><p>"When we look across our entire leadership population, that's mangers, directors and VPs, we want them to be a smaller percentage of our overall workforce over time," he said.</p><p>The 35% reduction refers to the number of managers who oversee fewer than three people, according to a person familiar with the matter. Many of those managers stayed with the company as individual contributors, said the person, who asked not to be named because the details are private.</p><p>Google CEO <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/sundar-pichai/">Sundar Pichai</a> weighed in at the meeting, reiterating the need for the company "to be more efficient as we scale up so we don't solve everything with headcount."</p><p>Google eliminated about 6% of its workforce in 2023, and has implemented cuts in various divisions since then. Alphabet finance chief Anat Ashkenazi, who joined the company last year, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/29/google-cfo-says-company-can-push-a-little-further-in-cost-savings.html">said</a> in October that she would push cost cuts "a little further."

            <pubDate>Wed, 27 Aug 2025 20:03:01 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://dw-news.dreamwidth.org/44429.html">https://dw-news.dreamwidth.org/44429.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45044440">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I'll start with the tl;dr summary to make sure everyone sees it and then explain further: As of <strong>September 1</strong>, we will temporarily be forced to <strong>block access to Dreamwidth from all IP addresses that geolocate to Mississippi</strong> for legal reasons. This block will need to continue until we either win the legal case entirely, or the district court issues another injunction preventing Mississippi from enforcing their social media age verification and parental consent law against us. </p>

<p>Mississippi residents, we are so, so sorry. We really don't want to do this, but the legal fight we and Netchoice have been fighting for you had a temporary setback last week. We genuinely and honestly believe that we're going to win it in the end, but the Fifth Circuit appellate court said that the district judge was wrong to issue <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mssd.125118/gov.uscourts.mssd.125118.59.0.pdf">the preliminary injunction</a> back in June that would have maintained the status quo and prevented the state from enforcing <a href="https://legiscan.com/MS/bill/HB1126/2024">the law</a> requiring any social media website (which is very broadly defined, and which we definitely qualify as) to deanonymize and age-verify all users and obtain parental permission from the parent of anyone under 18 who wants to open an account. </p>

<p>Netchoice took that appellate ruling up to the Supreme Court, who declined to overrule the Fifth Circuit with no explanation -- except for Justice Kavanaugh agreeing that we are likely to win the fight in the end, but saying that it's no big deal to let the state enforce the law in the meantime. </p>

<p>Needless to say, it's a big deal to let the state enforce the law in the meantime. The Mississippi law is a breathtaking state overreach: it forces us to verify the identity and age of every person who accesses Dreamwidth from the state of Mississippi and determine who's under the age of 18 by collecting identity documents, to <em>save</em> that highly personal and sensitive information, and then to obtain a permission slip from those users' parents to allow them to finish creating an account. It also forces us to change our moderation policies and stop anyone under 18 from accessing a wide variety of legal and beneficial speech because the state of Mississippi doesn't like it -- which, given the way Dreamwidth works, would mean blocking people from talking about those things at all. (And if you think you know exactly what kind of content the state of Mississippi doesn't like, you're absolutely right.)</p>

<p>Needless to say, we don't want to do that, either. Even if we wanted to, though, we can't: the resources it would take for us to build the systems that would let us do it are well beyond our capacity. You can read <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/8zy9o2f2amk3gsvai4c2v/Paolucci-Declaration-NC-v-Fitch.pdf?rlkey=ppn4oun27q002jsxdwpzdav5t&amp;e=1&amp;dl=0">the sworn declaration</a> I provided to the court for some examples of how unworkable these requirements are in practice. (That isn't even everything! The lawyers gave me a page limit!) </p>

<p>Unfortunately, the penalties for failing to comply with the Mississippi law are incredibly steep: fines of $10,000 per user from Mississippi who we don't have identity documents verifying age for, per incident -- which means every time someone from Mississippi loaded Dreamwidth, we'd potentially owe Mississippi $10,000. Even a single $10,000 fine would be rough for us, but the per-user, per-incident nature of the actual fine structure is an existential threat. And because we're part of the organization suing Mississippi over it, and were explicitly named in the now-overturned preliminary injunction, we think the risk of the state deciding to engage in retaliatory prosecution while the full legal challenge continues to work its way through the courts is a lot higher than we're comfortable with. Mississippi has been itching to issue those fines for a while, and while normally we wouldn't worry much because we're a small and obscure site, the fact that we've been yelling at them in court about the law being unconstitutional means the chance of them lumping us in with the big social media giants and trying to fine us is just too high for us to want to risk it. (The excellent lawyers we've been working with are Netchoice's lawyers, not ours!)</p>

<p>All of this means we've made the <em>extremely</em> painful decision that our only possible option for the time being is to block Mississippi IP addresses from accessing Dreamwidth, until we win the case. (And I repeat: I am absolutely <em>incredibly</em> confident we'll win the case. And apparently Justice Kavanaugh agrees!) I repeat: I am so, so sorry. This is the last thing we wanted to do, and I've been fighting my ass off for the last three years to prevent it. But, as everyone who follows the legal system knows, the Fifth Circuit is gonna do what it's gonna do, whether or not what they want to do has any relationship to the actual law.</p>

<p>We don't collect geolocation information ourselves, and we have no idea which of our users are residents of Mississippi. (We also don't <em>want</em> to know that, unless you choose to tell us.) Because of that, and because access to highly accurate geolocation databases is extremely expensive, our only option is to use our network provider's geolocation-based blocking to prevent connections from IP addresses they identify as being from Mississippi from even reaching Dreamwidth in the first place. I have no idea how accurate their geolocation is, and it's possible that some people not in Mississippi might also be affected by this block. (The inaccuracy of geolocation is only, like, the 27th most important reason on the list of "why this law is practically impossible for any site to comply with, much less a tiny site like us".)</p>

<p>If your IP address is identified as coming from Mississippi, beginning on September 1, you'll see a shorter, simpler version of this message and be unable to proceed to the site itself. If you would otherwise be affected, but you have a VPN or proxy service that masks your IP address and changes where your connection appears to come from, you won't get the block message, and you can keep using Dreamwidth the way you usually would.</p>

<p>On a completely unrelated note while I have you all here, have I mentioned lately that I really like <a href="https://protonvpn.com/">ProtonVPN's</a> service, privacy practices, and pricing? They also have a free tier available that, although limited to one device, has no ads or data caps and doesn't log your activity, unlike most of the free VPN services out there. VPNs are an excellent privacy and security tool that every user of the internet should be familiar with! We aren't affiliated with Proton and we don't get any kickbacks if you sign up with them, but I'm a satisfied customer and I wanted to take this chance to let you know that.</p>

<p>Again, we're so incredibly sorry to have to make this announcement, and I personally promise you that I will continue to fight this law, and all of the others like it that various states are passing, with every inch of the New Jersey-bred stubborn fightiness you've come to know and love over the last 16 years. The instant we think it's less legally risky for us to allow connections from Mississippi IP addresses, we'll undo the block and let you know.</p>

        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I am an AI hater. This is considered rude, but I do not care, because I am a hater.</p>

<p>To speak politely about AI, you put disclaimers before criticism: of course I’m not against it entirely; perhaps in a few years when; maybe for other purposes, but. You are supposed to debate how and when it should be used. You are supposed to take for granted that it must be useful somewhere, to someone, for something, eventually. People who are rich and smart and respected are saying so, and it would be arrogant to disagree with such people.</p>

<p>But I am a hater, which is a kind of integrity. It means I am willing to disagree with anyone, even if it is rude. “But I only use it to–” “Actually if you just—” “The new models–” “I was making fun–” Stop. You’re embarrassing yourself. I am embarrassed for you.</p>

<p>Critics have already written thoroughly about the <a href="https://www.teenvogue.com/story/chatgpt-is-everywhere-environmental-costs-oped">environmental</a> <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy8gy7lv448o">harms</a>, the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ai-artificial-intelligence-health-business-90020cdf5fa16c79ca2e5b6c4c9bbb14">reinforcement</a> of <a href="https://www.noemamag.com/the-exploited-labor-behind-artificial-intelligence/">bias</a> and generation of <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/07/09/nx-s1-5462609/grok-elon-musk-antisemitic-racist-content">racist output</a>, the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-12/ai-eroded-doctors-ability-to-spot-cancer-within-months-in-study?embedded-checkout=true">cognitive harms</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/26/technology/chatgpt-openai-suicide.html">AI supported suicides</a>, the problems with <a href="https://www.404media.co/deepfake-harassment-ohio-undress-clothoff-nudify-apps/">consent</a> and <a href="https://jskfellows.stanford.edu/theft-is-not-fair-use-474e11f0d063">copyright</a>, the way AI tech companies further the <a href="https://karendhao.com/">patterns of empire</a>, how <a href="https://thecon.ai/">it’s a con</a> that enables <a href="https://voiceofsandiego.org/2025/04/14/as-bot-students-continue-to-flood-in-community-colleges-struggle-to-respond/">fraud</a> and <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/10/04/1080801/generative-ai-boosting-disinformation-and-propaganda-freedom-house/">disinformation</a> and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/fbi-says-artificial-intelligence-being-used-sextortion-harassment-2023-06-07/">harassment</a> and <a href="https://www.aclu.org/news/privacy-technology/machine-surveillance-is-being-super-charged-by-large-ai-models">surveillance</a>, the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/millions-of-workers-are-training-ai-models-for-pennies/">exploitation of workers</a>, as an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/688679/amazon-ceo-andy-jassy-ai-efficiency">excuse to fire workers</a> and de-skill work, how they <a href="https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/illusion-of-thinking">don’t actually reason</a> and probability and association are <a href="https://thegradient.pub/machine-learning-wont-solve-the-natural-language-understanding-challenge/">inadequate to the goal of intelligence</a>, how people think it makes them faster when it <a href="https://metr.org/blog/2025-07-10-early-2025-ai-experienced-os-dev-study/">makes them slower</a>, how it is inherently mediocre and fundamentally conservative, how it is at its core a <a href="https://newsocialist.org.uk/transmissions/ai-the-new-aesthetics-of-fascism/">fascist technology</a> rooted in the <a href="https://aworkinglibrary.com/writing/toolmen">ideology of supremacy</a>, defined not by its technical features but <a href="https://ali-alkhatib.com/blog/defining-ai">by its political ones</a>.</p>

<p>But I am more than a critic: I am a hater. I am not here to make a careful comprehensive argument, because people have already done that. If you’re pushing slop or eating it, you wouldn’t read it anyway. You’d ask a bot for a summary and forget what it told you, then proceed with your day, unchanged by words you did not read and ideas you did not consider.</p>

<p>I am here to be rude, because this is a rude technology, and it deserves a rude response. Miyazaki said, “<a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/insult-life-itself-studio-ghiblis-193724631.html">I strongly feel that this is an insult to life itself.</a>” Scam Altman said we can <a href="https://fight.fudgie.org/search/show/tpw/episode/20250723_Wed#line3691">surround the solar system with a Dyson Sphere</a> to hold data centers. Miyazaki is right, and Altman is wrong. Miyazaki tells stories that blend the ordinary and the fantastic in ways people find deeply meaningful. Altman tells lies for money.</p>

<p>And I’m glad they’re lies. Because the makers of AI aren’t damned by their failures, they’re damned by their goals. They want to build a genie to grant them wishes, and their wish is that nobody ever has to make art again. They want to create a new kind of mind, so they can force it into mindless servitude. Their dream is to invent new forms of life to enslave.</p>

<p>And to what end? In a kind of nihilistic symmetry, their dream of the perfect slave machine drains the life of those who use it as well as those who turn the gears. What is life but what we choose, who we know, what we experience? Incoherent empty men want to sell me the chance to stop reading and writing and thinking, to stop caring for my kids or talking to my parents, to stop choosing what I do or knowing why I do it. Blissful ignorance and total isolation, warm in the womb of the algorithm, nourished by hungry machines.</p>

<p>And even as it consumes those who use it, even as the scammers become their own marks, even as it is sustained by exploited workers slotted in as human filters for algorithmic abuse – some people want to have a little, as a treat. As a joke. Just to make fun of it, just for the busywork, because it’s good enough, right? You understand.</p>

<p>I do understand: you want permission. There’s a machine in the corner wrapped in human skin that makes things out of shit and blood to look like whatever you want (as long as you don’t look too closely). You gave one to your teacher and they didn’t notice. Your boss told you to use it after they laid off half the team and it was fine. You fed one to your kids and they liked it. You want to know you can use it sometimes without me thinking less of you. You don’t need me to believe it’s useful, you just want me to be polite about it.</p>

<p>But I am a hater, and I will not be polite. The machine is disgusting and we should break it. The people who build it are vapid shit-eating cannibals glorifying ignorance. I strongly feel that this is an insult to life itself.</p>

<p>I became a hater by doing precisely those things AI cannot do: reading and understanding human language; thinking and reasoning about ideas; considering the meaning of my words and their context; loving people, making art, living in my body with its flaws and feelings and life. AI cannot be a hater, because AI does not feel, or know, or care. Only humans can be haters. I celebrate my humanity.</p>

                                                                            <span>
                                -                                A failure of security systems at PayPal is currently causing concern for numerous German banks and private customers. A vast number of payments are reportedly being blocked, with merchants waiting on funds in the billions.

                                                                                    <p>                The US payment service provider PayPal has been quite popular in Germany for years. However, currently both private customers and banks are grappling with a problem. According to the "Süddeutsche Zeitung" (SZ), certain security systems at PayPal have reportedly failed. These are the systems designed to filter out fraudulent transactions. As a result, various German banks are said to have blocked payments from PayPal as early as Monday. The SZ estimated the amount involved to be more than ten billion euros.</p>
                            	<h3>PayPal security systems down - direct debits submitted unchecked</h3>
                                                        <p>PayPal is regularly exploited by fraudsters to get hold of citizens' money. The payment service's security systems are supposed to check and prevent such activity. However, these systems reportedly failed at the end of last week, causing PayPal to submit direct debits without verification.</p>
                        	    	            
                            
                                                                    <p>Portals like "Netzwelt" also report disruptions with the payment service. The blog "Cashys Blog" mentioned technical issues over the weekend. For days, customers have allegedly experienced difficulties processing transactions. Payments via direct debit are primarily being rejected, despite the accounts reportedly having sufficient funds.</p>
                                                        <p>However, this might not be directly related to the PayPal disruption but rather due to the banks' reactions. According to the "Süddeutsche Zeitung," banks noticed the unusually high volume of direct debits from PayPal on Monday, which appeared suspicious or fraudulent.</p>
                                                        <h3>Banks halted all PayPal transactions</h3>
                                                        <p>To prevent a potentially multimillion-euro fraud, several banks reportedly temporarily halted all PayPal transactions.</p>
                                                        <p>According to information from the "Süddeutsche Zeitung" (SZ), these banks include "Bayerische Landesbank", "Hessische Landesbank", and "DZ-Bank".</p>
                        	    	            
                                                                    <p>As a result, numerous merchants did not receive their funds. The newspaper reports that the banks may have frozen more than ten billion euros. As stated by the news agency News5, not only online shop payments were affected; customers are currently experiencing difficulties using PayPal at supermarket checkouts and in retail stores as well.</p>
                                                        <p>According to PayPal, it was a "temporary service disruption." The company's site states: "Over the weekend, there was a temporary service interruption that led to delays in transactions for a small number of accounts. The issue has since been resolved."</p>
                                                        <p>Even though PayPal claims to have fixed the problem, the effects of the outage are still noticeably impacting merchants and consumers, as reported by News5. PayPal lists several services as "under maintenance" on its status page. When payments will resume smoothly remains unclear.</p>
                                                        <h3>PayPal security systems down - impact across Europe</h3>
                                                        <p>According to information from the German Press Agency (dpa), the incident has been confirmed by the German Savings Banks and Giro Association (DSGV). In recent days, there have been "incidents involving unauthorized direct debits from PayPal affecting various financial institutions," the association stated. "These incidents had a significant impact on payment transactions throughout Europe, particularly in Germany. This was noticeable to customers of the Savings Banks Finance Group institutions for several hours last Monday."</p>
                        	    	            
                                                                    <p>Consumer advocates recommend that PayPal customers check their accounts for unauthorized debits.</p>
                                                        <p>Focus Online also reports on a major update that PayPal has presumably been implementing since August 25. Whether there is a connection between the disruption and the planned update remains unclear at this time.</p>
                                                        <p>PayPal is by far the most important online payment service in the German market, accounting for just under 30 percent of online purchases.</p>
