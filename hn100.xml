<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For years, startups have been taught to prioritize growth over everything else. Profitability was seen as unambitious or even wrong – something to worry about when you hit scale. Why focus on profits when money and valuations were easy to come by?</p><p>But that thinking was always flawed.</p><p>Profitability isn't unambitious; it's controlling your own destiny. It means you don't have to rely on investors for survival. It means you can focus on your unaltered vision and mission. And it means you as a founder decide the pace of growth. And once you experience it, it's hard to imagine doing things any other way.</p><p><a href="https://paulgraham.com/ramenprofitable.html">Paul Graham famously wrote about "ramen profitability"</a> – the point where a founding team could survive without external funding. He argued this made startups more attractive to investors, showing they could get customers to pay, were serious about building valuable products, and were disciplined with expenses.</p><p>Graham wrote his essay in 2009. I’d argue that we now live in a world where it’s not just easier to get ramen profitable, but traditionally profitable – while also growing fast.</p><p>At Linear we didn't set out to be profitable but kind of stumbled into it. We believed that to win this market we really needed to build a superior tool. The best way we knew how to do that was to keep the team small and focused. And when we launched after a year in private beta, almost all of our 100 beta users converted to paid customers. To our surprise, we realized it wouldn't take that long to become profitable if we kept the costs in check. Twelve months after launch, we hit profitability, and we've stayed profitable ever since.</p><p>I don't know why hiring massive teams ever became the norm. In my own experience, small teams always delivered better quality, and faster. Maybe it's fear of missing out if you don't grow the team fast. Maybe it's investors whispering that your team is "understaffed compared to benchmarks." Being understaffed compared to benchmarks almost always should be a source of pride, not a problem. People should be surprised how small your team is, not how big it is.</p><p>What holds you back is rarely team size – it's the clarity of your focus, skill and ability to execute. Larger teams mean slower progress, more management overhead, more meetings, more opinions, and usually dilution of vision and standards. Yet growing the team has somehow become a symbol of success.</p><p>At Linear, we hired our first employee after six months and roughly doubled the team each year. With each hire, we make sure they truly elevate the team. We don't set out to hire ten engineers – we hire the next <em>great</em> engineer. This intentional approach has allowed us to maintain both quality and culture.</p><p>The most underrated thing about profitability is how much peace of mind it gives you. Once you're profitable, you stop worrying about survival and focus on what really matters: building something great. Building the way you want. Instead of optimizing for the next fundraising round, you optimize for value creation.</p><p>While profitability might not come quickly for every startup, I believe it's achievable sooner than most think. If you're creating a new market, or truly require massive scale like a social network, or significant upfront investment like a hardware company, it might take longer. But if you're in a category where there isn't hard upfront investment, and you get some level of product-market fit with customers willing to pay, you can probably be profitable. You can decide to become profitable. And usually, it's a decision about how much and how fast you hire.</p><p><strong>Measure What Matters</strong></p><p>Revenue per employee is one of the clearest ways to see you’re hiring appropriately. While some of the best public companies benchmark at $1-2M per employee, for startups it's not unreasonable to target the range of $500k-$1M per employee.</p><p><strong>Understand Your Risk Profile</strong></p><p>Are you building something highly speculative where you're not sure if there's a market for it, or are you building something that already has a market but with a different take on it? In the former case profitability takes longer, but in the latter it could happen right away. Most software today, especially in the B2B space, is about building a modern version of something existing.</p><p><strong>Hire Intentionally and Slower</strong></p><p>For most software startups, ten people before product-market fit should be your ceiling, not your target. After PMF, every hire should address a specific, pressing need – not just fill out an org chart. At Linear, our deliberately slow headcount growth forced us to be selective, which meant making better hires. It also protected our culture, since rapid hiring often dilutes the very things that made your startup special in the first place. When you hire less, you naturally hire better.</p><p><strong>Raise on Your Own Terms </strong></p><p>Being profitable doesn't mean you have to be anti-investors. It means you have that choice, and investors are quite interested in profitable companies that also grow fast. You can raise more, less, or nothing. You can wait for the right timing, the right partner, or fund. For most ambitious startups, it can still be a good idea to raise something even if you could get by bootstrapping. Investors can still be helpful, and the additional cash balance can help you to make larger investments, or acquisitions.</p><p>The point is that you can be and are allowed to be profitable as a startup. It's not a bad thing, it's not an oxymoron or as hard as people make it out to be. The secret is that a lot of successful companies actually were quite profitable early on, they just didn't talk about it. When you're profitable, you make decisions based on what's best for your customers and your product, not what's best for impressing investors.</p><p>I didn't set out to build a profitable startup. But once I got there, I realized I wouldn't want to build a company any other way.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><header></header><section><article> <p>A few months back, while playing around with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://threejs.org/">Three.js</a>, I came across something that completely derailed my plans. Strange attractors - fancy math that creates beautiful patterns. At first I thought I'd just render one and move on, but then soon I realized that this is too much fun. When complexity emerges from three simple equations, when you see something chaotic emerge into beautiful, it's hard not to waste some time. I've spent countless hours, maybe more than I'd care to admit, watching these patterns form. I realized there's something deeply satisfying about seeing order emerge from randomness. Let me show you what kept me hooked.</p>

<h2>The Basics: Dynamical Systems and Chaos Theory</h2>
<p>Dynamical Systems are a mathematical way to understand how things <strong>change over time</strong>. Imagine you have a system, which
could be anything from the movement of planets to the growth of a population. In this system, there are rules that
determine how it evolves from one moment to the next. These rules tell you what will happen next based on what is
happening now. Some examples are, a pendulum, the weather patterns, a flock of birds, the spread of a virus in a
population (we are all too familiar with this one), and stock market.</p>
<p>There are two primary things to understand about this system:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Phase Space</strong>: This is like a big collection of all the possible states the system can be in. Each state is like a
snapshot of the system at a specific time. This is also called the <strong>state space</strong> or the <strong>world state</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamics</strong>: These are the rules that takes one state of the system and moves it to the next state. It can be
represented as a function that transforms the system from now to later.</li>
</ul>

<p>For instance, when studying population growth, a phase-space (world-state) might consist of the current population size
and the rate of growth or decline at a specific time. The dynamics would then be derived from models of population
dynamics, which, considering factors like birth rates, death rates, and carrying capacity of the environment, dictate
the changes in population size over time.</p>
<p>Another way of saying this is that the dynamical systems describe how things change over time, in a space of
possibilities, governed by a set of rules. Numerous fields such as biology, physics, economics, and applied mathematics,
study systems like these, focusing on the specific rules that dictate their evolution. These rules are grounded in
relevant theories, such as Newtonian mechanics, fluid dynamics, and mathematics of economics, among others.</p>
<h3 id="chaos-theory">Chaos Theory</h3>
<p>There are different ways of classifying dynamical systems, and one of the most interesting is the classification into
chaotic and non-chaotic systems. The change over time in non-chaotic systems is more deterministic as compared to
chaotic systems which exhibit randomness and unpredictability.</p>
<p><strong>Chaos Theory</strong> is the sub branch of dynamical systems that studies chaotic systems and challenges the traditional
deterministic views of causality. Most of the natural systems we observe are chaotic in nature, like the weather, a drop
of ink dissolving in water, social and economic behaviours etc. In contrast, systems like the movement of planets,
pendulums, and simple harmonic oscillators are extremely predictable and non-chaotic.</p>
<p>Chaos Theory deals with systems that exhibit irregular and unpredictable behavior over time, even though they follow
deterministic rules. Having a set of rules that govern the system, and yet exhibit randomness and unpredictability,
might seem a bit contradictory, but it is because the rules do not always represent the whole system. In fact, most of
the time, these rules are an approximation of the system and that is what leads to the unpredictability. In complex
systems, we do not have enough information to come up with a perfect set of rules. And by using incomplete information
to make predictions, we introduce uncertainty, which amplifies over time, leading to the chaotic behaviour.</p>

<p>Chaotic systems generally have many non-linear interacting components, which we partially understand (or can partially
observe) and which are very sensitive to small changes. A small change in the initial conditions can lead to a
completely different outcome, a phenomenon known as the <strong>butterfly effect</strong>. In this post, we will try to see the
butterfly effect in action but before that, let's talk about <strong>Strange Attractors</strong>.</p>
<h2>Strange Attractors</h2>
<p>To understand Strange Attractors, let's first understand what an attractor is. As discussed earlier, dynamical systems
are all about <strong>change over time</strong>. During this change, the system moves through different possible states (remember the
phase space jargon?). An attractor is a set of states towards which a system tends to settle over time, or you can say,
towards which it is <strong>attracted</strong>. It's like a magnet that pulls the system towards it.</p>
<p>For example, think of a pendulum. When you release it, it swings back and forth, but eventually, it comes to rest at the
bottom. The bottom is the attractor in this case. It's the state towards which the pendulum is attracted.</p>
<p>This happens due to the system's inherent dynamics, which govern how states in the phase space change. Here are some of
the reasons why different states get attracted towards attractors:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stability</strong>: Attractors are stable states of the system, meaning that once the system reaches them, it tends to stay
there. This stability arises from the system's dynamics, which push it towards the attractor and keep it there.</li>
<li><strong>Dissipation</strong>: Many dynamical systems have dissipative forces, which cause the system to lose energy over time. This
loss of energy leads the system to settle into a lower-energy state, which often corresponds to an attractor. This is
what happens in the case of the pendulum.</li>
<li><strong>Contraction</strong>: In some regions of the phase space, the system's dynamics cause trajectories to converge. This
contraction effect means that nearby states will tend to come closer together over time, eventually being drawn
towards the attractor.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some attractors have complex governing equations that can create unpredictable trajectories or behaviours. These
nonlinear interactions can result in multiple stable states or periodic orbits, towards which the system evolves. These
complex attractors are categorised as <strong>strange attractors</strong>. They are called "strange" due to their unique
characteristics.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Fractal Structure</strong>: Strange attractors often have a fractal-like structure, meaning they display intricate
patterns that repeat at different scales. This complexity sets them apart from simpler, regular attractors.</li>
<li><strong>Sensitive Dependence on Initial Conditions</strong>: Systems with strange attractors are highly sensitive to their initial
conditions. Small changes in the starting point can lead to vastly different long-term behaviors, a phenomenon known
as the "butterfly effect".</li>
<li><strong>Unpredictable Trajectories</strong>: The trajectories on a strange attractor never repeat themselves, exhibiting
non-periodic motion. The system's behavior appears random and unpredictable, even though it is governed by
deterministic rules.</li>
<li><strong>Emergent Order from Chaos</strong>: Despite their chaotic nature, strange attractors exhibit a form of underlying order.
Patterns and structures emerge from the seemingly random behavior, revealing the complex dynamics at play.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can observe most of these characteristics in the visualisation. The one which is most fascinating to observe is the
butterfly effect.</p>
<h3 id="the-butterfly-effect">The Butterfly Effect</h3>
<blockquote><p>A butterfly can flutter its wings over a flower in China and cause a hurricane in the Caribbean.</p></blockquote>
<p>One of the defining features of strange attractors is their sensitivity to initial conditions. This means that small
changes in the starting state of the system can lead to vastly different long-term behaviors, a phenomenon known as the

<p>In our visualisation, let's observe this behavior on Thomas Attractor. It is governed by the following equations:</p>
<div><p><h3>Thomas Attractor Equation</h3></p></div>
<p>A small change in the parameter <code>a</code> can lead to vastly different particle trajectories and the overall shape of the
attractor. Change this value in the control panel and observe the butterfly effect in action.</p>

<p>There is another way of observing the butterfly effect in this visualisation. Change the <code>Initial State</code> from <code>cube</code> to
<code>sphere surface</code> in the control panel and observe how the particles move differently in the two cases. The particles
eventually get attracted to the same states but have different trajectories.</p>

<h2>Implementation Details</h2>
<p>This visualization required rendering a large number of particles using Three.js. To achieve this efficiently, we used a
technique called <strong>ping-pong rendering</strong> <sup><a href="#user-content-fn-2" id="user-content-fnref-2" aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup>. This method handles iterative updates of particle systems directly on the GPU,
minimizing data transfers between the CPU and GPU. It utilizes two frame buffer objects (FBOs) that alternate roles: One
stores the current state of particles and render them on the screen, while the other calculates the next state.</p>
<h3 id="implementation-workflow">Implementation Workflow</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Setting Up Frame Buffer Objects (FBOs):</strong> We start by creating two FBOs, <code>ping</code> and <code>pong</code>, to hold the current and
next state of particles. These buffers store data such as particle positions in RGBA channels, making efficient use
of GPU resources.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Shader Programs for Particle Dynamics:</strong> The shader programs execute on the GPU and apply attractor dynamics to
each particle. Following is the attractor function which update the particle positions based on the attractor equation.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Rendering and Buffer Swapping:</strong> In each frame, the shader computes the new positions based on the attractor's
equations and stores them in the inactive buffer. After updating, the roles of the FBOs are swapped: The previously
inactive buffer becomes active, and vice versa.</p>

</li>
</ol>
<p>This combination of efficient shader calculations and the ping-pong technique allows us to render the particle system.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="centercontent">
<p itemprop="description">Last night I had a very strange experience: About two thirds of the way through reading a Web page about myself, Tim Bray, I
    succumbed to boredom and killed the tab. Thus my introduction to
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grokipedia">Grokipedia</a>. Here are early impressions.</p>

<p id="p-1"><span>On Bray</span> · 
My Grokipedia entry has over seven thousand words, compared to a mere 1,300 in
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Bray">my Wikipedia article</a>. It’s pretty clear how it was generated; an LLM, trained
    on who-knows-what but definitely including that Wikipedia article and this blog, was told to go nuts.</p>

<p>Speaking as a leading but highly biased expert on the subject of T. Bray, here are the key take-aways:</p>

<p id="p-2"><span>(Overly) complete</span> · 
It covers all the territory; there is no phase of my life’s activity that could possibly be encountered in combing the Web
    that is not exhaustively covered. In theory this should be good but in fact, who cares about the details of what I worked on
    at Sun Microsystems between 2004 and 2010? I suppose I should but, like I said, I couldn’t force myself to plod all the way
    through it.</p>

<p id="p-3"><span>Wrong</span> · 
Every paragraph contains significant errors. Sometimes the text is explicitly self-contradictory on the face of it,
    sometimes the mistakes are subtle enough that only I would spot them.</p>

<p id="p-4"><span>Style</span> · 
The writing has that LLM view-from-nowhere flat-affect semi-academic flavor. I don’t like it but the evidence suggests that
    some people do?</p>

<p id="p-5"><span>References</span> · 
All the references are just URLs and at least some of them entirely fail to support the text. Here’s an example. In
    discussion of my expert-witness work for the FTC in their litigation against Meta concerning its acquisitions of Instagram and
    WhatsApp, Grokipedia says:</p>

<blockquote><p>[Bray] opined that users' perceptions of response times in online services critically influence market
    dynamics.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It cites
    <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/FTCReplytoMetaResponse-CounterstatementofMaterialFacts.pdf">Federal
    Trade Commission’s Reply to Meta Platforms, Inc.’s Response to Federal Trade Commission’s Counterstatement of Material
    Facts</a> (warning: 2,857-page PDF). Okay, that was one of the things I argued, but the 425 pages of court documents that I
    filed, and the references to my reporting in the monster document, make it clear that it was one tiny subset of the main
    argument.</p>

<p>Anyhow, I (so that you won’t have to) spent a solid fifteen minutes spelunking back and forth through that FTC doc, looking
    for strings like “response time” and “latency” and so on. Maybe somewhere in those pages there’s support for the claim quoted
    above, but I couldn’t find it.</p>

<p id="p-6"><span>Useful?</span> · 
Wikipedia, in my mind, has two main purposes: A quick visit to find out the basics about some city or person or plant or
    whatever, or a deep-dive to find out what we <em>really</em> know about genetic linkages to autism or Bach’s relationship with
    Frederick the Great or whatever.</p>

<p>At the moment, Grokipedia doesn’t really serve either purpose very well. But, after all, this is release 0.1, maybe we
    should give it a chance.</p>

<p>Or, maybe not.</p>

<p id="p-7"><span>Woke/Anti-Woke</span> · 
The whole point, one gathers, is to provide an antidote to Wikipedia’s alleged woke bias. So I dug into that. Let’s consider
    three examples of what I found.  First, from that same paragraph about the FTC opinion quoted above:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>While Bray and aligned progressives contend that such dominance stifles innovation by enabling predatory acquisitions and
      reduced rivalry—evidenced by fewer startup exits in concentrated sectors—counterarguments highlight that Big Tech's scale has
      fueled empirical gains, with these firms investing over $240 billion in U.S. R&amp;D in 2024 (more than a quarter of national
      totals) and driving AI, cloud, and patent surges.[<a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2020/06/08/Anti-monopoly">128</a>]
      [<a href="https://www.intereconomics.eu/contents/year/2025/number/2/article/big-tech-and-the-us-digital-military-industrial-complex.html">131</a>] Six tech industries alone accounted for
      over one-third of 
      U.S. GDP growth from 2012–2021, comprising about 9% of the 
      economy and sustaining 9.3 million jobs amid falling consumer prices and rapid technological diffusion.
      [<a href="https://itif.org/publications/2023/05/30/six-tech-industries-accounted-for-more-than-one-third-of-gdp-growth-in-the-last-decade/">132]</a> 
      [<a href="https://jamesmadison.org/the-united-states-is-the-leader-of-the-digital-revolution-pro-tech-policies-are-key/">133</a>]
      Right-leaning economists often defend consumer welfare metrics and market self-correction, warning that forced divestitures
      risk eroding the efficiencies and investment incentives that have propelled sector productivity above 6% annual growth in key
      areas like durable manufacturing tech.
      [<a href="https://itif.org/publications/2025/09/19/five-persistent-myths-about-big-tech/">134</a>]
      [<a href="https://www.nber.org/digest/oct01/technology-and-productivity-growth?page=1&amp;perPage=50">135</a>]</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I’ve linked the numbered citations to the indicated URLs. Maybe visit one or two of them and see what you think? Four are
    to articles arguing, basically, that monopolies must be OK because the companies accused of it are growing really fast and
    driving the economy. They seem mostly to be from right-wing think-tanks but I guess that’s what those think-tanks are for.  One
    of them, #131, <cite>Big Tech and the US Digital-Military-Industrial Complex</cite>, I think isn’t helpful to the argument at
    all. But still, it’s broadly doing what they advertise: Pushing back against “woke” positions, in this case the position that
    monopolization is bad.</p>

<p>I looked at a couple of other examples.  For example, this is from the header of the Greta Thunberg article:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>While credited with elevating youth engagement on environmental issues, Thunberg's promotion of urgent, existential climate
      threats has drawn scrutiny for diverging from nuanced empirical assessments of climate risks and adaptation capacities, as
      well as for extending her activism into broader political arenas such as anti-capitalist and geopolitical protests.[5][6]</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Somehow I feel no urge to click on those citation links.</p>

<p>If Ms Thunberg is out there on the “woke” end of the spectrum, let’s flit over to the other end, namely the entry for
    J.D. Vance, on the subject of his book <cite>Hillbilly Elegy</cite>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Critics from progressive outlets, including Sarah Smarsh in her 2018 book <cite>Heartland</cite>, faulted the memoir for
      overemphasizing personal and cultural failings at the expense of structural economic policies, arguing it perpetuated
      stereotypes of rural whites as self-sabotaging.[71] These objections, often rooted in institutional analyses from academia and
      media, overlooked data on behavioral patterns like opioid dependency rates—peaking at 21.5 deaths per 100,000 in Appalachia
      around 2016—that aligned with Vance's observations of "deaths of despair" precursors.[72]</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I read and enjoyed <cite>Heartland</cite> but the citation is to a <cite>New Yorker</cite> article that doesn’t mention
    Smarsh. As for the second sentence… my first reaction as I trudged through its many clauses, was “life’s too short”.
    But seriously, opioid-death statistics weaken the hypothesis about structural economic issues? Don’t get it.</p>

<p id="p-8"><span>Take-away</span> · 
Wikipedia is,
    <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2024/06/15/Wikipedia-Pain">to quote myself</a>, the encyclopedia that “anyone who’s willing to
    provide citations can edit”.
    Grokipedia is “the encyclopedia that Elon Musk’s LLM can edit, with sketchy citations and no progressive argument left
    un-attacked.”</p>

<p>So I guess it’s Working As Intended?</p>

<p>As you all know, Google has introduced developer verification as a way to prevent users from installing “unregistered” APKs. This measure was taken as a security feature to link every APK in existence to its developer, as in Play Store.</p>

<p><a href="https://developer.android.com/developer-verification">Link to the Android documentation</a>, <a href="https://developer.android.com/developer-verification/guides/faq">link to FAQ</a></p>

<h2 id="why-this-is-bad">Why this is bad</h2>

<p>This has already been discussed by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/10/google-confirms-android-dev-verification-will-have-free-and-paid-tiers-no-public-list-of-devs/">ArsTechnica</a> and on some threads (some cherry-picked ones): <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/1nwddik/heres_how_androids_new_app_verification_rules/">reddit</a>, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45017028">ycombinator</a>, <a href="https://hackaday.com/2025/08/26/google-will-require-developer-verification-even-for-sideloading/">hackaday</a>.</p>

<p>A quick recap of the main points (as of 30 Oct 2025):</p>

<ul>
  <li>The base tier costs $25, as in Play Market. Requires an ID</li>
  <li>There will be a limited “hobbyist” unpaid license. Google claims that they won’t require an ID</li>
  <li>Legal info is told to be private, unlike with Play Market</li>
  <li>The verification code is supposed to be located in Play Services, <strong>but Google hasn’t published the source code yet</strong></li>
  <li>Google assures that it would be possible to install applications locally using ADB, <strong>but there are no details on this</strong></li>
  <li>Hobbyist license restrictions are unknown</li>
</ul>

<p>A few months prior Google has decided to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/google-makes-android-development-private-will-continue-open-source-releases/">make Android development private</a>, which seems to be a preparation for the upcoming changes (<a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-not-killing-aosp-3566882/">another article</a>). Due to this change in AOSP release format, it is no longer possible to track what exactly Google is doing.</p>

<p>My answer to this question is that it would simply prevent small developers from distributing their apps, including myself. If we take the legal route, a hobbyist license is supposed to have some limit on the number of installs by design. If we take, say, 10K installs, this is not enough in my case. Another question is how exactly the process of verification is going to happen, what if Google adopts the same rules as in Play Store? Taking my <a href="https://github.com/enaix/Kirikiroid2-debloated">fork of the old VN engine port</a>, this apk would not pass security checks, as the old codebase relies on legacy external storage permissions, which are banned in Play Store. If we take the adb route, there are <strong>no guarantees that this method is going to work in the future in the form you expect</strong>. For instance, Google mentions that this method is meant for on-device tests during development, and nothing prevents them from reporting the install to their servers and checking if a self-signed apk has been installed on other devices. Another way to put it, this is problematic for an average Android user to perform these steps, and this is going to be the developer’s problem.</p>

<p>The situation links pretty well with Samsung <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/say-goodbye-to-your-custom-roms-as-one-ui-8-kills-bootloader-unlock/">removing bootloader unlocking with the One UI 8 update</a>. Great, duh…</p>

<h2 id="the-concept">The concept</h2>

<p><img src="https://enaix.github.io/assets/img/loader1.svg" alt="apk loader"></p>

<p>My vision of the hack is to distribute a verified loader apk, which in turn dynamically loads any apk the user wants. A user obtains the loader apk once and loads apps without installing as much as they want.</p>

<p>The Java virtual machine in Android is the ART/Dalvik runtime (I will refer to it as Dalvik, it seems that Google hates cool names). Did you know that Dalvik natively <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/dalvik/system/PathClassLoader">allows dynamic code execution using PathClassLoader</a>? So an apk may just load some zip/apk/dex code from external storage and execute it in current context. Essentially, this means that we can natively load the apk into memory and execute any code inside of the target apk, and we are not altering the original code signature of the loader.</p>

<p>In order to actually run the apk, the loader needs to properly initialize the main activity (aka the main screen, or the entrypoint) of the target apk. So, the main activity needs to be initialized and somehow placed inside of the Android’s activity cycle with the loader acting as a wrapper. Then, the loader apk should handle other aspects like local files handling and names conflict resolution. This can be achieved by patching the target apk bytecode: .odex/.dex classes may be dynamically decompiled into .smali, analyzed and compiled back into a modified apk. Furthermore, the loader would have to parse AndroidManifest options of the target (main activity location, screen options).</p>

<h3 id="implementation">Implementation</h3>

<p>Developing such wrapper in a straightforward way has proven to be rather difficult, as Android <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/master/core/java/android/app/Activity.java">activity management logic</a> is extremely complicated and differs from version to version. In short, it was problematic to perform the initialization process the right way. Some people suggested to avoid the initialization step completely, and use Unsafe Dalvik api to register the target’s activity as the loader apk activity stub, which is declared in the loader’s manifest without class. I couldn’t find exact methods in the <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/sun/misc/Unsafe">Unsafe documentation</a>, but this actually may be a way to go.</p>

<p>Due to this particular issue I couldn’t bring the proof of concept to a working state in a reasonable time, and because of this I was considering to not publish this article at all. The purpose of this post is not to give a somewhat ready solution, but get some feedback on the concept, as I was not ready to devote lots of time on a potentially broken solution.</p>

<h2 id="the-logistics">The logistics</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Information provided in this section is for educational use only, all scenarios discussed below are hypothetical.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In order to install the loader apk on the device, it would require, well, some form of verification. Hobbyist license is the only choice here, as paying $25 for each attempt is not optimal. Since the hobbyist license has a limited number of installs, there should be multiple instances of the apk with separate licences. In this hypothetical scenario there may either be a pool of volunteers who sign the code, or completely random users who are willing to help. In the second case, the loader code would somehow need to be verified or scanned, since such distribution system would be vulnerable to malware.</p>

<p>The final and the most important issue in this process is the verification process itself, as the loader code may (and likely will) be flagged by Google. So, the code would require some form of obfuscation like code flow modification and implementing double functionality (for instance, registering it as a file manager). If Google decides to ban dynamic code loading altogether, the final solution would be to pack the Dalvik runtime into the loader as a native library. This of course would have extremely low performance, but it should be technically possible.</p>

<p>Overall, the hypothetical plan has lots of assumptions, with which I’m not happy with. First of all, it requires lots of manual work by the volunteers or random people, and this work also includes the apk obfuscation, which was not discussed in detail. Then, the verification process itself should be somewhat permissive to allow potentially suspicious apps (I would like to hear how does this happen with current Play Store verification).</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>The project described in this article by no means is a finished solution, and if you have started to think what else could work, it means that the article has reached its original goal. I believe that we would eventually come up with a proper solution in the future. Thank you for reading!</p>

<p>Most leaders reflexively think of silos as BAD and collaboration as GOOD. This manifesto defends silos and challenges the value of collaboration.</p>
<h2>Increasing collaboration can do harm</h2>
<p>In general, you should aim to maximize collaboration <em>within</em> teams, and minimize collaboration <em>between</em> teams.</p>
<h3>Why maximize collaboration within teams?</h3>
<p>A collaborative team works together on one or two goals. Why?</p>
<ul>
<li>This maximizes <a href="https://www.rubick.com/communication-is-shared-state/">shared state</a> — everyone has a common understanding of goals, progress, and who is doing what.</li>
<li>This gives team members a better ability to focus and coordinate their work with each other.</li>
<li>Team members have overlapping areas of knowledge, so they can critique each other’s work and help each other grow.</li>
<li>They are more innovative, because the interplay between people as they work on the same goal helps generate more diverse thinking and improve decision-making.</li>
<li>When someone leaves the team, the fact that others have a shared understanding of the work means the team can survive and continue to work effectively.</li>
<li>People can go on vacation or leave without as much disruption.</li>
</ul>
<p>Collaborative teams feel great to be a part of — everyone shares the same victories and accomplishments together. A team that doesn’t collaborate often really isn’t a team at all.</p>
<h3>Why minimize collaboration between teams?</h3>
<p>To the maximum extent possible, teams should have what they need to succeed within the borders of their team. And where that is not true, you need some structure to ensure the team can get what it needs in a way that will scale with the organization’s growth.</p>
<p>As companies grow, communication and dependencies proliferate. Companies start out with many-to-many communication. As they grow, the communication patterns within the company must necessarily switch to being segmented and defined. Otherwise, the communication burden on teams will grow at an exponential rate, and the increasing complexity will degrade the effectiveness of the company.</p>
<p>I observed an example of this at New Relic:</p>
<ol>
<li>As the engineering organization grew, we encouraged a collaborative culture and rewarded people for collaboration between teams (it was even part of our promotion criteria — you can blame that on me!).</li>
<li>After a few years, the increasing number of teams made it more and more difficult to manage dependencies between teams, to the point that it eventually became impossible to accomplish any large project within the organization. I know, because I was one of the “best project managers”, so I got put on many of those large projects — and they were systematically impossible to execute on. We all tried heroically to make it work, but the system was rigged — there wasn’t a way to accomplish these larger projects.</li>
<li>The solution to this was to eventually define the interaction models between teams, reduce dependencies, and add some <a href="https://www.rubick.com/product-council/?utm_source=ck-silos&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=silos">structure to prioritization</a> and communication.</li>
</ol>
<p>Looking back in retrospect, it was as obvious as math what happened, but I see organizations fall into this trap over and over. We’ll talk more about how to structure these solutions in the second blog post in this series.</p>
<p>Collaboration <em>sounds</em> great, but it’s something you want to actively be combating between teams. A little collaboration is fine, but excessive collaboration between teams is a sign your organization isn’t structured well. If you ever wonder why Bezos took such a hard line on his <a href="https://chrislaing.net/blog/the-memo/#fn:1">API mandate</a> in 2002, this probably factored into it. Bezos structured Amazon so that teams were as independent as possible.</p>
<h2>What are silos?</h2>
<p>Silos are boundaries between groups of people, based on the organizational structure and teams they’re working on.</p>
<h2>Why do silos exist?</h2>
<p>Silos exist because humans have cognitive and communication limits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Humans can only handle a certain number of relationships</li>
<li>Humans have a limit to how much communication they can handle.</li>
<li>Humans are pre-wired to think in terms of teams and tribes. We work better in small groups.</li>
<li>Humans have cognitive limits on the amount they can focus on.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s important to recognize that these limits are real limits, and not something you can wish away. Every company in the world (above a certain size) operates in teams that specialize. We organize into teams and have org structures generally because that is what human beings need to work in larger groups.</p>
<p>There are ways to flex certain aspects of this. For example, a company that is designed to be fully asynchronous can rely on process and tooling to change some of these constraints. But even then, you’re moving the constraints around, not eliminating them completely. You need to operate in a way that recognizes these limits.</p>
<h2>Why do leaders want to break down silos?</h2>
<p>Leaders start talking about breaking down silos when they see that individual parts of the company aren’t achieving larger business outcomes and are excessively focused on their own area. Alternatively, they talk about breaking down silos when parts of the company aren’t well coordinated with each other. Generally this happens once the organization has become complex enough that the structure is getting in the way.</p>
<p>Here are a couple of examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Marketing is planning a major announcement of an upcoming launch, but can’t get a timing commitment from the product and engineering teams.</li>
<li>Two teams in engineering are building the same service, but in slightly different ways.</li>
</ul>
<p>Leaders see these things, and start blathering about “breaking down silos” and “increasing collaboration”. What’s wrong with that?</p>
<h2>“Breaking down silos” represents incomplete thinking</h2>
<p><strong>“Breaking down silos” is an exhortation rather than a diagnosis or prescription of how to improve the situation</strong>. “Breaking down silos” blames individuals for not having a big enough vision and working across boundaries, instead of looking with curiosity at the system and asking <em>why</em> they are doing what they’re doing. It’s expecting people to have your level of perspective without figuring out why they don’t.</p>
<p>But the main problem is that it isn’t specific enough.</p>
<h2>Communication != Collaboration != Coordination</h2>
<p>When you hear someone say they want teams to collaborate more or break down silos, encourage them to look at the problem from three perspectives:</p>
<h3>Coordination</h3>
<p>Usually when people talk about collaboration, what they’re really looking for is better coordination.</p>
<p>Coordination is “the harmonious functioning of parts for effective results” (<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/coordination">Merriam-Webster</a>)</p>
<p>The US military found that the best way to coordinate groups of people quickly and effectively was to <a href="https://www.marines.mil/News/Publications/MCPEL/Electronic-Library-Display/Article/899837/mcdp-1/">centralize coordination and decentralize decision-making and execution</a>. This is still the state of the art for organizational design. You want local groups to be able to act independently and have what they need to be successful. You want centralized functions to set high level objectives and coordinate where necessary to produce the right outcomes.</p>
<p>We’ll talk in the second post in this series about a multitude of ways you can coordinate groups of people working together.</p>
<h3>Communication</h3>
<p>Communication is transferring information from one person or group to another.</p>
<p>When people talk about needing increased collaboration, you can often achieve this more effectively by looking at the flow of information between people, and redesigning it. Typically, you can do something like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ask people how they are getting information today.</li>
<li>Find out what information people actually need.</li>
<li>Design the lightest weight version of this you can imagine.</li>
<li>Try it out</li>
<li>Get feedback and act on that feedback.</li>
</ol>
<p>One thing I’ve done over and over in many startups is set up weekly communication on projects in engineering. This helps the marketing organization understand how to coordinate their work with engineering, among other benefits.</p>
<h3>Collaboration</h3>
<p>Collaboration is when people work together to produce an outcome. When teams are collaborating, it means they’re working with other teams to achieve outcomes together. That’s often a sign the team isn’t set up well. Ideally, it should have what it needs to do what it needs without dependencies on other teams.</p>
<p>A team that has to collaborate to achieve its objectives is going to be less reliably successful. In general, teams shouldn’t be collaborating with more than a couple of teams, unless they’re explicitly set up to be that way. For example, in some organizations you might set up the design team as a “service” organization which provides design for a larger organization. For teams that are set up that way, it can be fine, but it usually should be very carefully thought through. What is the interaction model for the team, and how will it deal with the inevitable fact that there will be excess demands on it? We’ll cover some of these patterns and their tradeoffs in the second post in this series.</p>
<p>Of course, the world is messy, and you shouldn’t expect a complete lack of collaboration between teams. But when you see teams collaborate, that’s something to pay attention to.</p>
<h2>Technical analogy</h2>
<p>You might think of silos as “encapsulation”. Leaders want to dig into the internals of the classes holding the logic they need. But it’s a bad solution to just bolt that on — you really need to refactor things so that they are better structured.</p>
<h2>How do you get teams to coordinate better?</h2>
<p>In the next post in this series, I share concrete <a href="https://www.rubick.com/coordination-models/">patterns that help teams and departments work across organizational boundaries</a>.</p>

The answer is that corporate-run gambling is now pervasive in America, and Americans don’t like what they see. Gambling, particularly online sports betting, is now everywhere. About a fifth of Americans </span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/10/02/americans-increasingly-see-legal-sports-betting-as-a-bad-thing-for-society-and-sports/" rel="">placed</a><span> a bet in the past year, mostly through gambling apps. Since 2018, when online sports gambling got a big boost from a key Supreme Court decision, Americans have </span><a href="https://www.legalsportsreport.com/sports-betting-states/revenue/" rel="">bet</a><span> more than half a trillion dollars on sports. </span></p><p><span>And the attempts to change our culture are extremely visible; I watched the Dolphins-Ravens game last night on Amazon Prime, and I lost count of the number of ads for DraftKings and FanDuel, with various celebrities lending their names to this cultural phenomenon. Every major sports media network, sports league, and podcast are now working with a major gambling company. At this point, gambling is intrinsic to the financing of sports; FanDuel now </span><a href="https://www.theringer.com/2025/10/24/nba/nba-gambling-scandal-chauncey-billups-terry-rozier-adam-silver" rel="">operates</a><span> “15 regional sports networks across the country previously on the brink of bankruptcy.”</span></p><p><span>The broad consequences are also extremely visible. Take athletics. Americans love sports, and that cultural centerpiece is being corrupted in an orgy of greed and speculative ferver. Last week, the government </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/24/nyregion/nba-sports-betting-gambling-scandal.html" rel="">charged</a><span> six people, including two NBA players, for gambling-related fraud. It’s also contributing to a courser culture, with a lot of unfair pressure on athletes. According to </span><a href="https://www.usnews.com/banking/articles/2025-sports-betting-and-debt-survey" rel="">US News</a><span>, “21% of sports bettors say they’ve verbally abused an athlete, either in person or online, after losing money on a bet.”</span></p><p><span>And that’s not even getting into the costs of fostering a nation of gamblers, lured in by an app-based model that is far more convenient and addictive than traditional in-person betting. Today, four out of five </span><a href="https://www.usnews.com/banking/articles/2025-sports-betting-and-debt-survey" rel="">betters</a><span> are using betting apps or online platforms. A quarter of bettors can’t pay a bill because of their wagers, a third have gambling debts, more than half carry credit card debts, and a quarter of them are afraid they can’t control their gambling. Economists are </span><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4903302" rel="">finding</a><span> a “substantial increase in average bankruptcy rates, debt sent to collections, use of debt consolidation loans, and auto loan delinquencies” for consumers in states that legalized online sports betting versus those that restrict it to in-person locations. The estimates I’m told privately by experts in the field is that in the next five years, all gambling - including lotteries, Las Vegas casinos, and online sports betting - will likely see Americans lose a trillion dollars or so. </span></p><p><span>Last year, I did an Organized Money episode with </span><a href="https://www.organizedmoney.fm/p/episode-9-vice-monopolists-fanduel" rel="">Les Bernal and Dr. Kavita Fischer</a><span> on the problem; Fischer is a psychiatrist who downloaded Draft Kings in 2022 to unwind after putting her kids to bed. She ended up losing $600,000, explaining to the Wall Street Journal </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/hospitality/gambling-addiction-sports-betting-apps-4463cde0?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqe_LgM0Z396EKHXo_vX_T0lmObkaGlhcn_70DubGAlGLAdOYy3eVA3oEIMTn54%3D&amp;gaa_ts=6903c02c&amp;gaa_sig=4Unk99tCx4UcVWnftJq8NI6YmawFu_0g7uLipAxDCJHhMqxXNTJwZpnNcAEIbnSPCv8Prh1ibH__NiNBzMETJA%3D%3D" rel="">the story</a><span> of how DraftKings used sophisticated techniques to keep her betting, even as she desperately tried to stop.

Fischer’s story is very common, and it’s occurring among middle and upper middle class people who were never exposed to other forms of gambling, like state lotteries and casinos. It’s also hitting kids, who themselves are often calling in to help lines with addiction. It’s so common that Saturday Night Live did a viral skit for a fictional company called “Rock Bottom Kings,” which allows people to take bets on their degenerate gambling addict friend’s behavior. </p><div id="youtube2-wXZNuwY_5-U" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;wXZNuwY_5-U&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/wXZNuwY_5-U?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></p></div><p><span>Increasingly, people are turning against this form of betting. According to Pew,  43% of U.S. adults </span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/10/02/americans-increasingly-see-legal-sports-betting-as-a-bad-thing-for-society-and-sports/" rel="">say</a><span> “the fact that sports betting is now legal in much of the country is a bad thing for society,” up from 34% just a few years ago. And that’s concentrated among young men, who are most exposed; “47% of men under 30 say legal sports betting is a bad thing for society, up from 22% who said this in 2022.” And opposition is increasing faster among people who bet than people who don’t. It’s not that people oppose betting with friends, what’s problematic is the ability to build a business around being the house.</span></p><p><span>In an important sense, it’s odd that we’re even dealing with pervasive corporate-run gambling. Historically, Americans understood systemic gambling, and associated similar abuses of power like usury, as a moral and social catastrophe in waiting. That has been true since the 19th century, with many states making gambling unconstitutional, through to the fixing of the 1919 World Series, but it was also true well into the 20th century, when corporate gambling was constrained to mobster-run places like Las Vegas and Atlantic City. Even into the 1960s, courts </span><a href="https://scholarship.law.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=2957&amp;context=clr" rel="">prevented</a><span> the patenting of gambling machines on the grounds they conflicted with the “sound morals of society.”</span></p><p><span>And culturally, we understood it as well, with gambling represented as a sinful and harmful enterprise. Take the 1987 smash hit movie </span><em>Back to the Future II. </em><span>In it, the villain, Biff Tannen, uses a time machine to alter the past so that he becomes a wealthy and corrupt casino magnate over a dilapidated town, Hill Valley. The hero, Marty McFly, in turn, must find a way to revert Hill Valley to its previous state. </span><em>Back to the Future II</em><span> was the third highest grossing film of 1989, and I remember as a kid we all saw it, and in school all my friends wondered whether hoverboards were real. Everyone just knew that corporate-run gambling was seedy.</span></p><p><span>With a few exceptions, up until the 1960s this attitude applied to all corporate gambling, from sports betting to lotteries, which were seen as similar to the “numbers racket” of the mob. But in 1963, New Hampshire Governor John King, egged on by the conservative </span><em>Manchester Union Leader, </em><span>signed a bill to create the first state lottery, to the horror of most newspapers nationwide and the Federal government, which arrested out-of-state residents for buying tickets. </span></p><p><span>Why did New Hampshire allow its new “sweepstakes” game? Well, it was </span><a href="https://www.nhmagazine.com/how-nh-defied-the-feds-mob-and-church-to-create-the-first-state-lottery/" rel="">pitched</a><span> as part of the anti-tax revolution that would take over the nation fifteen years later. One of the key supporters was Bill Loeb, the arch-conservative publisher of the </span><em>Manchester Union Leader, </em><span>who “favored the Sweepstakes because he feared without it the Legislature would pass a sales tax — something he abhorred over all else.” </span></p><blockquote><p>Pointing to the state’s reliance on so-called “sin taxes,” Loeb penned the strongest defense of the lottery yet. “No one has to go to the track and bet. No one has to smoke tobacco. No one has to drink. But how do those who oppose the Sweepstakes propose to raise the money? Either a sales tax or a property tax or some other kind of levy that people will have to pay, even though it will hurt them dreadfully to do so.”</p></blockquote><p>The New Hampshire lottery served as the “legitimization” of gambling, turning it from a seedy activity into something sanctioned by a state. And it also set in motion the same dynamic with gambling we see today, which is that residents from outside of New Hampshire would buy lottery tickets from that state, because they couldn’t get them where they live. So their state officials would wonder why they are foregoing revenue, leading to a daisy chain of legalization. Corporate gambling tended to expand in a similar pattern. After people saw that a simple state lottery could bring in more revenue, they allowed more complex gambling games, and then in-person casinos and racetracks, slot machines, and sports betting. And every time someone tried to block the expansion, the response was “well people will just do it across state lines.”</p><p>After New Hampshire, New Jersey and New York created lotteries. Then, in the 1970s, a host of progressive-leaning states across the northeast created lotteries to deal with austerity budgets, and to capture the revenue they were foregoing when their own residents went to other states to buy lottery tickets. These included Connecticut, Massachusetts, Maryland, Maine, Illinois, Ohio, Rhode Island, Vermont, Pennsylvania, and Michigan. Much of the rest of the country legalized lotteries in the 1980s for similar reasons, though a few states - Utah, Alaska, and Hawaii - have not. </p><p><span>In the South, religious conservatives opposed gambling, but Reagan Republicans changed this dynamic. Moral scold Bill Bennett, who wrote “The Book of Virtues” and served as Secretary of Education and Drug Czar under Reagan, </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/03/us/relentless-moral-crusader-is-relentless-gambler-too.html" rel="">exempted</a><span> gambling from his list of sins, himself carrying millions in gambling debts. A key actor was eventual RNC Chair Frank Fahrenkopf, who brought casino interests into the national Republican world, welding it together with Wall Street cash and big hotel chains by forming the American Gaming Association. </span></p><p>Corporations got into gambling in a major way. “Before 1989, you couldn’t get mainstream, Wall Street money in this industry,” said one reporter. “Now, not only can you get, they’re throwing it at you.” Fahrenkopf talked about the inflow of big corporate interests, it was now “professionals - people who have gone to business school.” These were “some of the brightest business men and women now involved in running these companies,” with the ability to “sit down with Goldman Sachs, or Bear Sterns or whoever it might be and convince them that number one, it’s a legitimate business.”</p><p><span>Martin Scorcese, in the ending of the iconic movie </span><em>Casino, </em><span>described this shift from the mob control of Vegas to Wall Street control. “Where did the money to rebuild the pyramids come from?” asked Las Vegas Sands casino leader and mobster Sam “Ace” Rothstein after he lost control of the town. “Junk Bonds.”</span></p><div id="youtube2-fBp8lLjZohg" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;fBp8lLjZohg&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:&quot;78&quot;,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fBp8lLjZohg?start=78&amp;rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></p></div><p>When the internet became mainstream in the 1990s, online gambling wasn’t legal, but online gambling offerings from offshore casinos became a major problem. Tennessee Senator Bill Frist, with a coalition of progressives and religious conservatives, moved a bill called the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act in 2006, which banned money transfers to offshore gaming companies. But the UIGEA had an exemption for fantasy sports, which proponents laughably called a game of skill and not chance. Over the course of the next two decades, the firms that took advantage of this law then unleashed a state-by-state lobbying campaign to legalize online sports betting.</p><p><span>The Supreme Court, in 2018, </span><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/17pdf/16-476_dbfi.pdf" rel="">said</a><span> states could legalize online sports gambling, unleashing a lobbying campaign such that 39 states now allow it. Today, when you pass sports bars on Sunday’s, many of them now have special sections dedicated to gambling. On a moral and political level, many Americans came to accept corporate gambling as just another business, like usury or wild forms of financial speculation. </span></p><p>Democrats often invite gambling as a mechanism to bring in more revenue for the state. And on the right, a former casino magnate, Donald Trump, is now in the White House, and his track record running that sort of business simply didn’t enter the political debate. Trump drew immense support from the anti-gambling religious right, and progressive Democrats mocked Trump for losing money running a casino, but not for engaging in that business in the first place. </p><p>In other words, Biff Tannen’s dastardly scheme to organize a town around gambling interests would today be framed as just good economic development. </p><p>Beyond the substantive harm, there’s an ideological valence to corporate gambling. Corporate-run gambling is an unusual commercial activity, for two reasons. One is that there’s nothing produced, it’s a pure net transfer of wealth from the gambler to the casino. But the second and more important one is that it’s addictive, and thus coercive. </p><p>Gambling releases dopamine, the chemical behind pleasure and anticipation, and over time, it changes the chemistry of one’s brain to create a dependency on continuing the activity. As Fischer put it, “There was just something in my brain that made me keep going.” Thus, a company engaged in corporate gambling is seeking to take advantage of the other party’s very ability to govern their own rational faculties. </p><p>Most people think of legitimate market transactions as involving two parties coming together in a voluntary exchange based on reasonably honest information. You can go back to Aristotle and Thomas Aquinas, all the way through the populists and John Wanamaker, and find the basics of fair pricing - no coercion, no deception. But the coercion is real, and so is deception. Every online sports gambling commercial includes a help line if you have a problem, and all of the firms in the industry say they maintain ethical standards. And yet, as the Wall Street Journal story showed, their ideal customer is one who gambles excessively. </p><p><span>As legal scholar Matthew Lawrence noted, addiction is a </span><a href="https://scholarlycommons.law.emory.edu/faculty-articles/82/" rel="">fundamental threat</a><span> to liberty. Because there is an imbalance in power between the parties in the transaction, corporate gambling requires far stricter rules and regulations, or perhaps even bans, than markets for goods that are not addictive. </span></p><p>Corporate gambling also has significant broader negative consequences. Online sports betting corrupts sports and the public itself. And states often derive revenue from the practice, meaning that legislators, even if they wanted to eliminate the activity, would have to plug a fiscal hole. Like all products that foster addiction, corporate gambling creates a form of social pollution, in the form of ruined lives and public corruption. And that’s why it’s important to impose market rules that significantly limit the activity and the political power of those who profit from it.</p><p>While the religious right and Catholic institutions oppose gambling, progressives have not been particularly concerned until recently, preferring to scold around questions of race and gender than traditional fire and brimstone sins. But that is changing, as the left swings more towards concern over inequality and economics than non-commercial questions. </p><p>So what can be done?</p><p><span>Gambling is legal in other countries, for better or worse. There are a number of regulatory choices that lessen its impact. In the UK, for instance, they have what are called “</span><a href="https://harmreductionjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12954-024-01150-3" rel="">stake limits</a><span>” for certain online games, meaning that gamblers have a limit on the amount they can bet in any one contest. The stake limits </span><a href="https://www.gamblinginsider.com/news/28198/government-debates-gambling-reform-online-slot-stake-limits-and-statutory-levy-introduced" rel="">are lower</a><span> for certain ages. In addition, they regulate VIP programs such as the ones that entrapped Fischer, which has cut problem gambling somewhat.</span></p><p>In the U.S., we are just starting to figure out how to push back. There are possible levers around the use of data to target customers with advertisements, eliminating push notifications and VIP programs, prohibiting discrimination against “sharps,” aka people who are good at sports betting. </p><p><span>But there are significant hurdles, and not just the standard issues involved in dealing with well-capitalized corporate opponents, who engage in multiple forms of lobbying, everything from direct contacts with lawmakers to working with think tanks like </span><a href="https://www.progressivepolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/PPI-Legalized-Sports-Betting.pdf" rel="">the Progressive Policy Institute</a><span>. Unlike most other industries, corporate gambling is also a partnership with the state. To run a casino, race track, or online betting app, you need a license, and must pay the state some portion of your revenues. States themselves run lotteries. And that means gambling revenue is part of state budgets.</span></p><p><span>Take Maryland. Out of $24.86 billion of </span><a href="https://www.marylandcomptroller.gov/content/dam/mdcomp/md/reports/financial/FY2024-Closeout.pdf" rel="">state revenue</a><span> last year, $1.589 billion came from the lottery, the state’s casinos, sportsbooks and daily fantasy sports operators. Most of that was from casinos and lotteries, sports was just $89.9 million. But if you want to outlaw this harmful activity, you have to find a way to replace 6.4% of Maryland’s budget, which is slightly less than the entire amount the state brings in from corporate taxes. The fiscal gains from gambling revenues </span><a href="https://rockinst.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2016-04-12-Blinken_Report_Three-min.pdf" rel="">are vastly overstated</a><span>. In the short-term, it usually delivers, but quickly peters out. Indeed, Maryland Governor Wes Moore just </span><a href="https://www.legalsportsreport.com/233974/moore-signs-maryland-sports-betting-tax-hike/" rel="">increased taxes</a><span> on sports betting, as a way to plug a budget gap. And the costs are </span><a href="https://www.crainsnewyork.com/op-ed/op-ed-casino-revenues-are-often-short-lived-and-not-sustainable-over-long-run" rel="">likely higher</a><span> than the revenue gains. Gambling, as it turns out, is just as addictive to states as it is to gamblers, with less bang for the buck over time.</span></p><p><span>And it gets worse during economic downturns, as Pat Garofalo </span><a href="https://boondoggle.substack.com/p/the-biggest-lottery-scam-is-the-lottery" rel="">wrote</a><span> in his invaluable newsletter. </span></p><blockquote><p><span>Lottery playing increases </span><a href="https://taxfoundation.org/blog/does-lottery-revenue-rise-or-fall-during-economic-hardship/#:~:text=Of%20the%2042%20states%20with,.%20%2C%20in%202001%2D2." rel="">when joblessness rises</a><span>, and more than 20 state lotteries set sales records during the Great Recession.</span></p><p><span>Because states have tied specific programs to lottery funding, they </span><em>need</em><span> that desperation, or else lottery-tied funding falls during economic downturns, when other revenues are also going south, leaving states with more holes they need to fill.</span></p><p><span>Just look at </span><a href="https://www.governing.com/finance/what-happens-to-public-budgets-when-residents-spend-less-on-the-lottery?utm_campaign=Newsletter%20-%20GOV%20-%20Future%20of%20Finance&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_7WehIfJlb1uP4po4OjBslRQp91fDfrmHzge7Rpdrq7BjHEk9kLWH_Xf9Al028bB-6WJ9cjW_aaApgTQPU7575UtilXw&amp;_hsmi=387104456&amp;utm_content=387104456&amp;utm_source=hs_email" rel="">this recent interview</a><span> with the executive director of the Virginia lottery. Though he pays a lot of lip service to ensuring that Virginians don’t become addicted to lottery games, it’s clear his overriding concern is ensuring that people keep playing even as the state’s economic outlook worsens.</span></p><p>He brings up expanding online games in order to bring in more young players, explains that “offering a mix of gaming experiences and price points helps draw in different kinds of players,” and says he wants to put lottery games into restaurants and bars — because nothing says “we’re taking gambling addiction seriously” quite like giving people easy access to gambling and alcohol together.</p></blockquote><p><span>As Garofalo noted, </span><a href="https://www.governing.com/finance/what-happens-to-public-budgets-when-residents-spend-less-on-the-lottery?utm_campaign=Newsletter%20-%20GOV%20-%20Future%20of%20Finance&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_7WehIfJlb1uP4po4OjBslRQp91fDfrmHzge7Rpdrq7BjHEk9kLWH_Xf9Al028bB-6WJ9cjW_aaApgTQPU7575UtilXw&amp;_hsmi=387104456&amp;utm_content=387104456&amp;utm_source=hs_email" rel="">10 percent</a><span> of Virginia’s public education is tied to gambling money. Even though gambling costs a state more than it brings in, cutting corporate gambling likely means it’ll be necessary to tax the wealthy.</span></p><p><span>Beyond the fiscal hurdles, there are attempts to make it impossible to even regulate gambling at a state level. Kalshi, a company that operates what it calls “prediction markets” to allow people to speculate on things like elections, is now offering sports betting. Kalshi claims that its sports betting is not gambling, but a form of useful financial market-exchange. That’s of course nonsense, but the goal is to have a Federal regulator, the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, override state limits on gambling. If Kalshi wins on its legal argument, then online sports betting will be legal everywhere, without state permission. So far, Kalshi </span><a href="https://www.bhfs.com/insight/third-times-the-charm-for-gambling-regulators-in-kalshi-litigation/" rel="">has won</a><span> in Nevada and New Jersey, but lost in Maryland, which means this decision will eventually have to be addressed on appeal.</span></p><p><span>The politics of this particular administration on gambling are ugly; Trump’s first pick to run the CFTC was a board member of Kalshi; after he withdrew, the </span><a href="https://www.ingame.com/cftc-pick-selig-letter-backing-sports-contracts/" rel="">next pick</a><span> is a lawyer for a firm that invested in Kalshi. Moreover, Donald Trump Jr. is an investor in Kalshi, and President Trump’s company, TruthSocial, is </span><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/trump-truth-social-launches-prediction-market/" rel="">launching</a><span> a predictions market as well (as is DraftKings).</span></p><p>All of these dynamics make the institutions hard to reform. Yet, the most important tool is public opinion, and that has not been brought to bear until recently. </p><p>The underpinning of the anti-corporate gambling movement is the same as the anti-monopoly argument. A free society relies on rules that prevent arbitrary coercion, both in and out of the marketplace. For a long time, we have neglected the role of commerce in a moral order, choosing to ignore gambling, usury, fraud, and deceit, as well as monopolization and a whole variety of games around price. What’s happening, as we are enveloped in a world of unreality, of crypto and fraud, AI bubbles, and sports gambling, is that the corruption of our society, with the rise of scams and flattery, is becoming impossible to ignore.</p><p>Senator Benson’s bill to roll back online sports gambling in Maryland may be one of the first important moves to go on offense against corporate gambling, but it won’t be the last.</p><p><span>Thanks for reading!

<p><em>As part of our <a href="https://lil.law.harvard.edu/our-work/public-data-project/">Public Data Project</a>, LIL recently launched <a href="https://lil.law.harvard.edu/data-gov-archive/">Data.gov Archive Search</a>. In this post, we look under the hood and reflect on how and why we built this project the way we did.</em></p>

<hr>

<h2 id="rethinking-the-old-trade-off-cost-complexity-and-access">Rethinking the Old Trade-Off: Cost, Complexity, and Access</h2>

<p>Libraries, digital humanities projects, and cultural heritage organizations have long had to perform a balancing act when sharing their collections online, negotiating between access and affordability. Providing robust features for data discovery, such as browsing, filtering, and search, has traditionally required dedicated computing infrastructure such as servers and databases. Ongoing server hosting, regular security and software updates, and consistent operational oversight are expensive and require skilled staff. Over years or decades, budget changes and staff turnover often strand these projects in an unmaintained or nonfunctioning state.</p>

<p>The alternative, static file hosting, requires minimal maintenance and reduces expenses dramatically. For example, storing gigabytes of data on Amazon S3 may cost $1/month or less. However, static hosting often diminishes the capacity for rich data discovery. Without a dynamic computing layer between the user’s web browser and the source files, data access may be restricted to brittle pre-rendered browsing hierarchies or search functionality that is impeded by client memory limits. Under such barriers, the collection’s discoverability suffers.</p>

<p>For years, online collection discovery has been stuck between a rock and a hard place: accept the complexity and expense required for a good user experience, or opt for simplicity and leave users to contend with the blunt limitations of a static discovery layer.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="why-we-explored-a-new-approach">Why We Explored a New Approach</h2>

<p>When LIL began thinking about how to provide discovery for the <a href="https://source.coop/harvard-lil/gov-data/">Data.gov Archive</a>, we decided that building a lightweight and easily maintained access point from the beginning would be worth our team’s effort. We wanted to provide low-effort discovery with minimal impact on our resources. We also wanted to ensure that whatever path we chose would encourage, rather than impede, long-term access.</p>

<p>This approach builds on our recent experience when the Caselaw Access Project (CAP) hit <a href="https://lil.law.harvard.edu/blog/2024/03/26/transitions-for-the-caselaw-access-project/">a transition moment</a>. At that time, we elected to switch <a href="http://case.law/">case.law</a> to a static site and to partner with others dedicated to open legal data to provide more feature-rich access.</p>

<p>CAP includes some 11 TB of data; the Data.gov Archive represents nearly 18 TB, with the catalog metadata alone accounting for about 1 GB. Manually browsing the archive data in its repository, even for a user who knows what she’s looking for, is laborious and time-consuming. Thus we faced a challenge. Could we enable dynamic, scalable discovery of the Data.gov Archive while enjoying the frugality, simplicity, and maintainability of static hosting?</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="our-experiment-rich-discovery-no-server-required">Our Experiment: Rich Discovery, No Server Required</h2>

<p>Recent advancements in client-side data analysis led us to try something new. Tools like <a href="https://duckdb.org/docs/api/wasm/">DuckDB-Wasm</a>, <a href="https://phiresky.github.io/blog/2021/hosting-sqlite-databases-on-github-pages/">sql.js-httpvfs</a>, and <a href="https://protomaps.com/">Protomaps</a>, powered by standards such as WebAssembly, web workers, and HTTP range requests, allow users to efficiently query large remote datasets in the browser. Rather than downloading a 2 GB data file into memory, these tools can incrementally retrieve only the relevant parts of the file and process query results locally.</p>

<p>We developed Data.gov Archive Search on the same model. Here’s how it works:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Data storage:</strong> We store Data.gov Archive catalog metadata as sorted, compressed Parquet files on Source.coop, taking advantage of performant static file hosting.</li>
  <li><strong>In-browser query engine:</strong> Our client-side web application loads DuckDB-Wasm, a fully functional database engine running inside the user’s browser.</li>
  <li><strong>On-demand data access:</strong> When a user navigates to a resource or submits a search, our DuckDB-Wasm client executes a targeted retrieval of the data needed to fulfill the request. No dedicated server is required; queries run entirely in the browser.</li>
</ul>

<p>This experiment has not been without obstacles. Getting good performance out of this model demands careful data engineering, and the large DuckDB-Wasm binary imposes a considerable latency cost. As of this writing, we’re continuing to explore speedy alternatives like <a href="https://github.com/hyparam/hyparquet">hyparquet</a> and <a href="https://idl.uw.edu/arquero">Arquero</a> to further improve performance.</p>

<p>Still, we’re pleased with the result: an inexpensive, low-maintenance static discovery platform that allows users to browse, search, and filter Data.gov Archive records entirely in the browser.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="why-this-matters-for-libraries-digital-humanities-projects-and-beyond">Why This Matters for Libraries, Digital Humanities Projects, and Beyond</h2>

<p>This new pattern offers a compelling model for libraries, academic archives, and DH projects of all sizes:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Lower operating costs:</strong> By shifting from an expensive server to lower cost static storage, projects can sustainably offer their users access to data.</li>
  <li><strong>Reduced technical overhead:</strong> With no dedicated backend server, security risks are reduced, no patching or upgrades are needed, and crashing servers are not a concern.</li>
  <li><strong>Sustained access:</strong> Projects can be set up with care, but without demanding constant attention. Organizations can be more confident that their archive and discovery interfaces remain usable and accessible, even as staffing or funding changes over time.</li>
</ul>

<p>Knowing that we are not the only group interested in approaching access in this way, we’re sharing our generalized learnings. We see a few ways forward for others in the knowledge and information world:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Prototype or pilot:</strong> If your organization has large, relatively static datasets, consider experimenting with a browser-based search tool using static hosting.</li>
  <li><strong>Share and collaborate:</strong> Template applications, workflows, and lessons learned can help this new pattern gain adoption and maturity across the community.</li>
</ul>

<p>This project is still evolving, and we invite others—particularly those in libraries and digital cultural heritage—to explore these possibilities with us. We’re committed to open sharing as we refine our tools, and we welcome collaboration or feedback at <a href="mailto:lil@law.harvard.edu">lil@law.harvard.edu</a>.</p>

The Ministry achieved this status by <a href="https://nextcloud.com/blog/austrias-ministry-of-economy-takes-decisive-steps-toward-digital-sovereignty/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">migrating 1,200 employees to a Nextcloud-based cloud and collaboration platform</a> hosted on Austrian-based infrastructure.&nbsp;</p><p>This shift away from proprietary, foreign-owned cloud services, such as <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-you-can-get-microsoft-365-formerly-office-for-free-3-easy-ways/">Microsoft 365</a>, to an <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-open-source-and-how-does-it-benefit-you/">open-source</a>, European-based cloud service aligns with a growing trend among European governments and agencies. They want control over sensitive data and to declare their independence from US-based tech providers.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Also: <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/europes-plan-to-ditch-us-tech-giants-is-built-on-open-source-and-its-gaining-steam/">Europe's plan to ditch US tech giants is built on open source - and it's gaining steam</a></strong></p><p>European companies are encouraging this trend. Many of them have joined forces in the newly created non-profit foundation, the EuroStack Initiative. This foundation's goal is " to organize action, not just talk, around the pillars of the initiative: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/euro-stack_foundation-press-release-activity-7389635091049840641-J3gZ?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAAAKH4BBvA-ZwpVFbaZDTqwLgneEpGsrHQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Buy European, Sell European, Fund European</a>."&nbsp;</p><p>What's the motive behind these moves away from proprietary tech? Well, in Austria's case, Florian Zinnagl, CISO of the Ministry of Economy, Energy, and Tourism (BMWET), explained, "We carry responsibility for a large amount of sensitive data -- from employees, companies, and citizens. As a public institution, we take this responsibility very seriously. That's why we view it critically to rely on cloud solutions from non-European corporations for processing this information."</p><p><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/europes-plan-to-ditch-us-tech-giants-is-built-on-open-source-and-its-gaining-steam/">Austria's move and motivation echo similar efforts in Germany, Denmark, and other EU states and agencies</a>. The organizations include the German state of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/german-state-replaces-microsoft-exchange-and-outlook-with-open-source-email/">Schleswig-Holstein, which abandoned Exchange and Outlook for open-source programs</a>. Other agencies that have taken the same path away from Microsoft include the <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-european-military-just-ditched-microsoft-for-open-source-libreoffice-heres-why/">Austrian military</a>, <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-denmark-is-dumping-microsoft-office-and-windows-for-libreoffice-and-linux/">Danish government</a> organizations, and the <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-city-is-dumping-microsoft-office-and-windows-for-onlyoffice-and-linux-heres-why/">French city of Lyon</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Also: <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/inside-canonicals-plan-to-make-ubuntu-26-04-the-linux-desktop-that-finally-goes-mainstream/">Inside Canonical's plan to make Ubuntu 26.04 the Linux desktop that finally goes mainstream</a></strong></p><p>All of these organizations aim to keep data storage and processing within national or European borders to enhance security, comply with privacy laws such as the <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/gdpr-an-executive-guide-to-what-you-need-to-know/">EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</a>, and mitigate risks from potential commercial and foreign government surveillance.&nbsp;</p><p>Open-source software is seen as combining the virtues of faster development and better security, while providing companies and governments with more control, as general manager Thierry Carrez of the <a href="https://openinfra.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">OpenInfra Foundation</a> recently suggested: "Open infrastructure allows nations and organizations to maintain control over their applications, their data, and their destiny while benefiting from global collaboration." &nbsp;</p><!----><p>The US government is worried about this trend. <a href="https://pro.politico.eu/news/207200" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">American diplomats have complained to French and German officials</a> ahead of November's <a href="https://dig.watch/event/summit-on-european-digital-sovereignty" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Summit on European Digital Sovereignty</a>&nbsp;about the European push for digital sovereignty. This high-level event will bring together EU institutions, member states, public and private sector leaders, and other key stakeholders to advance Europe's digital sovereignty agenda.&nbsp;</p><p>While the US may not like it, with NextCloud's help, BMWET completed its migration in just four months. Although BMWET had already begun adopting Microsoft 365 and <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-copilot-is-taking-over-teams-heres-how-ai-will-shape-your-daily-workflow/">Teams</a>&nbsp;before the project's start, the shift was still considered a success. That's because instead of reversing its path, the ministry implemented a hybrid architecture: Nextcloud handles internal collaboration and secure data management, while Teams remains available for external meetings.</p><p>The project emphasized integration with existing workflows, including seamless integration with Outlook email and calendar via Sendent's Outlook app. This approach minimized disruption and ensured user acceptance. However, not all migrations progress so well.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, in Austria, the <a href="https://www.derstandard.de/story/3000000293383/prozentzeichen-statt-bundesadler-wie-die-justiz-ihre-it-umstellt" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ministry of Justice decided to replace Office with LibreOffice</a>. Yet the transition has run into trouble. It appears that the move of 20,000 desktops, which was prompted by a desire to reduce spending on Microsoft licenses, has been, as one person reported, an "unprofessional, rushed operation." Some offices are still on Office, others on LibreOffice, and they're running into incompatible document format problems and misfires in e-mail systems.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Also:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/10-open-source-windows-apps-i-cant-live-without-and-theyre-all-free/">10 open-source Windows apps I can't live without - and they're all free</a></strong></p><p>The moral of the story is that any switch from one software suite to another requires careful handling by the IT department and helpdesk staff. Otherwise, you end up with unhappy users.</p><p>That said, BMWET's bold shift to Nextcloud appears to have gone well. This initiative demonstrates that adopting sovereign cloud solutions can be practical, user-friendly, and rapid in the public sector. However, as Austria's Justice Ministry experience has shown, simply shifting to an open-source approach without careful planning can get in the way of getting work done.&nbsp;</p><div id="pinbox-575d8711-4f9c-4bea-8980-f0ae20a04381"><h4>Open Source</h4> <!---->  </div></div></div>]]></description>
