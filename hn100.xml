<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div lang="en"><section id="sec1"><p id="p-1">Imagine you are a company with a lot of remote employees, and they all hate the local Internet service providers (ISPs). Videoconferences are the worst: People cannot hear each other, they randomly start sounding like Darth Vader, and they occasionally just disappear from the conversation.</p><p id="p-2">Or you are a small ISP, and your <i>customers</i> say they hate you.</p><p id="p-3">When you talk to your ISP or supplier, they say, “Buy more bandwidth.” When your customers complain to their ISP, they are told the same thing. But when you measure how much bandwidth you are using at the busiest part of the day, it is 30% or 50%.</p><p id="p-4">In a sense, the suppliers are right: Bandwidth really boils down to the “diameter of the pipe” between you and your employees or customers. If it is too small your data, connections, and more will really get bogged down.</p>

<p id="p-5">Once you are not filling the pipe, though, when you are only 50% busy, you need to look at the software and see what is keeping your packets from arriving in a reasonable amount of time. For example, I once measured the time to send a “ping” to downtown Toronto from my home office in the suburbs. It took 0.13s to get downtown and back. That is the normal ping time for Istanbul, Turkey, roughly 8,000 km away.<a href="#FN1" data-jats-rid="FN1" data-jats-ref-type="fn"><sup>a</sup></a></p><p id="p-6">That is a pure software problem, and it is called <i>high latency</i>.</p></section><section id="sec2"><h2>Bandwidth Is How Much, Latency Is How Slow</h2><p id="p-7">If you think of the Internet as a series of pipes, then bandwidth conveys how much data you can send down the pipe.

You will have starved yourself. If you buy a pipe big enough to contain your data, you are fine. The data will all flow straight down the pipe instead of having to sit around waiting for the previous bytes to squeeze their way through.</p><p id="p-9">However, buying a pipe with a larger diameter than you need will not help. Your data will still flow into it without delay, but it will not go any faster. It will not exceed the speed of light.

The least latency you can have equals the length of the pipe divided by the speed of light.

Contention.</figcaption></figure></div></figure><p id="p-13">If you have bad router software, the smaller Zoom slices will have to sit around in a queue (buffering) until the photos finish. Because the Zoom slices are delayed, other people on the Zoom call may see you freeze or stutter. Sometimes you will sound like you are shouting from the bottom of a well. On really bad days, you will just drop out.</p></section><section id="sec4"><h2>Bad Router Software</h2><p id="p-14">In the home, the problem is in the software on the home router, which connects to the wider Internet. The bug is called <i>bufferbloat,</i><a href="#B1" data-jats-ref-type="bibr" data-jats-rid="B1"><sup>1</sup></a> as described by Phillipa Harrison in the <i>Communications</i> research article, “Buffer-Bloated Router? How to Prevent It and Improve Performance.”<a href="#B2" data-jats-ref-type="bibr" data-jats-rid="B2"><sup>2</sup></a> In this bug, the sender buffers up the photos and as soon as the network is available, sends them all. While doing that, it cannot send the videoconferencing slices, so it delays them and sends them only after the photos complete.</p><p id="p-15">That might be fine for computers, but humans discussing something need their words to come in the right order, without delays or interruptions. The photos should share the network fairly with the videoconference and not steal all the bandwidth.</p></section><section id="sec5"><h2>Good Router Software</h2><p id="p-16">In the best of all possible worlds, every router on the Internet would be running software that has the latest changes to minimize latency, usually fq_codel or CAKE. Unfortunately, not everyone can update as often as they would like, and router manufacturers are often years behind on rewriting their proprietary operating systems to include the newest fixes. Some are even back at PIE, a much older predecessor to CAKE.</p><p id="p-17">Home modem/router/Wi-Fi boxes are, if anything, worse. They get built, used, and thrown away when they die. They never get updated. The net result is a lot of old, buggy software on the Internet, and a lot of packets sitting in queues twiddling their thumbs as they wait for a chance to be sent.</p><p id="p-18">Individuals took control of the problem by adding a smarter router between their home and their ISP’s modem/router/Wi-Fi box. The smart router keeps data flowing as fast as the pipe will allow, sending “I’m having contention” signals that the older software can understand when any of the machines in your home network send too much.</p></section><section id="sec6"><h2>Fixing the ISP</h2><p id="p-19">Adding devices to the home does not scale. If you are a company, you cannot afford to buy a new home router for each of your employees. If you are an ISP, you cannot just tear out painfully expensive core routers to install newer ones.</p><p id="p-20">The answer is not to tear out routers but to adapt the techniques used in the home. If your customers hate you, put a device with modern software in the path to your customers, downstream of your routers. Such a device is dedicated only to dealing with buffering, bloat, and contention. That also keeps the price down, because an older single-socket Xeon with eight cores can handle 10Gbps of traffic.</p><p id="p-21">The name of the software for the ISP device is LibreQoS (<a href="https://libreqos.io/" data-jats-ext-link-type="uri">https://libreqos.io/</a>), where <i>QoS</i> means <i>quality of service</i>. It came out from the same team that pioneered the fq_codel and CAKE software that addressed the problem at the home-router end.</p><p id="p-22">They viewed the problem from the Internet end and set out to help ISPs and other companies that could not trivially buy more bandwidth, but instead had to make better use of what they had.</p><p id="p-23">Their solution is to apply a complete suite of fixes to IP networking, which includes:</p><ul data-jats-list-type="bullet"><li><p id="p-24">Fair queuing</p></li><li><p id="p-25">Bandwidth shaping</p></li><li><p id="p-26">Active queue management</p></li><li><p id="p-27">Diffserv handling</p></li><li><p id="p-28">Ack filtering</p></li><li><p id="p-29">Network topology awareness</p></li><li><p id="p-30">Parallel processing</p></li><li><p id="p-31">Bypassing Linux bridge overheads</p></li><li><p id="p-32">Built-in round-trip time measurement to show the improvement</p></li></ul><p id="p-33">All these fixes work together to find the highest rate that does not overload the slowest part of the system. That means packets do not have to sit in a queue at the ISP, waiting for a chance to be sent, like the videoconferencing packets waiting at home for an image to finish uploading.</p><p id="p-34">The first fixes are fair queuing and control of delay, from fq_codel.</p><p id="p-35">CAKE then added Active Queue Management (AQM), which performs the same kind of bandwidth probing that vanilla TCP does but adds in-band congestion signaling to detect congestion as soon as possible. The transmission rate is slowly raised until a congestion signal is received, then reduced. Once reduced, it starts increasing again, continuously searching for the highest rate it can use without causing a queue to build up. The algorithm used is an extension of fq_codel.</p><p id="p-36">The fairness component prevents particular flows from being starved of resources by other streams, like our photo example, or by hosts starting large numbers of streams to try stealing as much of the network bandwidth as they can.</p><p id="p-37">Diffserv is a mechanism for labeling packets as interactive (high priority) through bulk (low priority), so bulk file transfer can be recognized and kept from delaying videoconferences.</p><p id="p-38">Related to this, but not part of diffserv itself, is an algorithm to detect and properly prioritize sparse flows, so they will not be starved.</p><p id="p-39">Ack filtering entirely removes packets that are merely carrying an acknowledgment of received data, so long as there are enough non-empty packets flowing the same way to take over that task.</p><p id="p-40">Next, we come to LibreQoS itself, which adds components specific to running at the ISP end of the network. The first component is a network topology tree, because an ISP will have many routes to its customers, each with its own maximum rate that must be discovered and processed by its own instance of the flow-shaping code.</p><p id="p-41">On top of this sits a hierarchical token-bucket classifier that sorts the incoming packets into the correct CPU core and the correct “shaper” rule. The standard Linux shaper that CAKE uses is single-threaded and tends to run out of capacity above 6Gbps. The LibreQoS shaper is limited only by the number and speed of the CPU cores and Ethernet cards.</p><p id="p-42">LibreQoS 1.4 introduced a new fast Ethernet bridge, based on eXpress Data Path (XDP) and extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF), to avoid bottlenecking on the <code>ksoftirqd</code> thread in the kernel. When they were finished with the performance work, the LibreQoS crew added software to measure and manage the improvement: a new low-overhead <i>round-trip time sensor</i>, a packet-capture system, and a suite of real-time programs to measure and visualize the performance of large numbers of routes and customers.</p><p id="p-43">This is a mature technology and runs on standard equipment, such as an ISP might already have. As a concrete example, an ISP delivering 1Gbps service plans to its customers and with up to 10Gbps total throughput would need a CPU such as an Intel Xeon E-2388G with eight cores, 16GB of memory, and a dual-port 10G Ethernet card—a very ordinary 1u-sized machine from 2021.</p><p id="p-44">Now a company with bad performance can ask its ISP to fix it and point at the software and people who have already used it. If the ISP already knows it has a performance complaint, it can get ahead of the problem by proactively implementing LibreQoS.</p></section><section id="sec7"><h2>Proof</h2><p id="p-45">If you have already solved the problem with LibreQoS, you can see the fix happening in real time. In Figure <a href="#F4" data-jats-ref-type="fig" data-jats-rid="F4">4</a>, a customer is downloading Diablo 2 and Diablo 4 at the same time over a 100Mbps link. The link shows as completely saturated in the throughput graph, but the delay is tiny: 1.7ms with peaks to 3.1. Fair queuing keeps the delay below levels that humans or Zoom can detect.</p><figure id="F4" data-jats-position="float"><p><a data-fslightbox="https://cacm.acm.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/3690840_fig04.jpg" data-type="image" data-caption="Figure 4.

And <i>badly</i> is exactly how it behaved until I put a debloated home router in front of the ISP’s device.</p><figure id="F5" data-jats-position="float"><p><a data-fslightbox="https://cacm.acm.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/3690840_fig05.jpg" data-type="image" data-caption="Figure 5.

<p><strong>Content warning:</strong> This blog post references domestic abuse and violence but doesn’t go into specific detail.</p>
<p>I’m not an expert in that topic <em>at all</em>, so I may not use the preferred terminology in all instances. Sorry.</p>
</div>
<p>Last year (oh how time flies), we launched the <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/exit-this-page/">GOV.UK Design System’s Exit this Page component</a>, or EtP for short.</p>
<picture>
  <source type="image/webp" srcset="https://beeps.website/images/-6SGpmSnGw-300.webp 300w, https://beeps.website/images/-6SGpmSnGw-600.webp 600w, https://beeps.website/images/-6SGpmSnGw-900.webp 900w, https://beeps.website/images/-6SGpmSnGw-1164.webp 1164w" sizes="(min-width: 768px) 66vi, 100vi"><img loading="lazy" src="https://beeps.website/images/-6SGpmSnGw-1164.webp" width="1164" height="400" alt="A large red button with 'Exit this page' written on it in plain white text."></picture>
<p>On the surface, it’s a simple component. It’s a big red button that sticks to the top of the screen. If you click it, you’re taken away to BBC Weather.</p>
<p>But it does so much more.</p>
<p>If you press the <kbd>⇧ Shift</kbd> key on your keyboard three times, you get a visual indicator that you are activating the button. Upon the third press, the page you’re on is blanked out and you’re redirected away to… well, BBC Weather again.</p>
<p>It’s intended to be a safety tool. A way for people in unstable, potentially violent, domestic situations to quickly leave the page.</p>
<p>But one question that comes up a lot is…</p>
<h2 id="why-don%E2%80%99t-you-use-escape%3F">Why don’t you use Escape?</h2>
<p>It’s a decent question. Many other implementations of buttons like this exist, and of the ones that provide a keyboard shortcut, they almost universally use the Escape key: <kbd>Esc</kbd>.</p>
<p>And it’s literally called Escape. Why wouldn’t you use it for an escape function?</p>
<p>Basically, it doesn’t quite work like that. There was a veritable rabbit hole of barriers that ultimately led us towards using a different key.</p>

    <blockquote>
<p>Do rabbit holes normally have barriers, actually?</p>
</blockquote>
  </figure>
<h3 id="1.-escape-stops-the-browser-from-loading-pages">1. Escape stops the browser from loading pages</h3>
<p>In virtually all browsers, pressing Escape while a webpage is loading stops the loading process.</p>
<p>This is literally the last thing we want to happen for a feature whose sole job is to load a different page from the one you’re on.</p>
<p>If we had used Escape, it would be too easy for a user to accidentally cancel the redirection process and end up stuck on the current page, and that’d be a bit naff.</p>
<h3 id="2.-escape-performs-other-functions-in-the-operating-system">2. Escape performs other functions in the operating system</h3>
<p>In addition to cancelling loading, we found that the Escape key was used by too many other functions to reliably work for exiting the page.</p>
<p>For example, Escape is also used to exit fullscreen media (and on macOS, fullscreen apps), close modal dialogs and popovers (including those generated by native input controls), cancel a dragging interaction, clear a text input, and dismiss notifications.</p>
<p>Assistive technologies may also use the Escape key for functionality, and it is also used as part of keyboard shortcuts.</p>
<p>All of these take priority over the page’s JavaScript, which often meant needing to press the Escape key more than the requisite three times, creating confusion as to whether the function actually worked as advertised.</p>
<p>In the case of macOS and fullscreen apps, it even involved having to wait for the re-windowing animation to finish before the page could begin to intercept Escape key presses again. Very not ideal.</p>
<h3 id="3.-pressing-escape-isn%E2%80%99t-considered-a-user-interaction">3. Pressing Escape isn’t considered a user interaction</h3>
<p>Do you remember popup ads? When you’d open up a website and immediately a new window would open purely to shove advertising in your face?</p>
<p>How about autoplaying audio and videos? Or when pages begged you to stay when you tried to close them? Or those immediate “do you want notifications from us?” dialogs?</p>
<p>These are all the result of people exploiting JavaScript’s mostly-unrestricted ability to do stuff, usually to try and make money.</p>
<p>As a result of advertising people being bastards, more and more of what the web platform can do is now being locked behind the requirement of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Transient_activation">transient activation</a>—that is, the browser will refuse to run pieces of JavaScript unless it is <em>certain</em> that some manner of user interaction took place with the intention of running it.</p>
<p>Browsers use a few different heuristics to determine user interaction, including touches, mouse movements, and key presses. If it detects one of these that seems human enough, it will allow transiently activated code to run for a short period afterwards.</p>
<figure>
    <figcaption>
      <img src="https://beeps.website/images/ash/hwK5Ig77-0-150.webp" width="150" height="150" alt="An amphimorpho looking alarmed and grimacing.">
    </figcaption>
    <blockquote>
<p>This can have some unfortunate ramifications on accessibility.</p>
<p>As we’ve recently learned on the GOV.UK Design System team, webpage interactions made by some assistive software (in this case, Dragon NaturallySpeaking) are not considered user interactions for the purposes of transient activation, so some JavaScript code will either not work or will work inconsistently for users of that software.</p>
</blockquote>
  </figure>
<p>Redirecting the user away to another page via JavaScript is one such function that requires user interaction before it will run.</p>
<p>And <kbd>Esc</kbd> is <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/interaction.html#user-activation-processing-model:activation-triggering-input-event">the <em>only</em> keyboard key that doesn’t count as user interaction</a> for the purposes of transient activation.</p>
<p>This meant that if a user tried to use the EtP shortcut immediately after a page loaded, or after a short period having not interacted with the page (for example, if they were busy reading it), the redirection just wouldn’t work. Totally doubleplus ungood.</p>
<h2 id="alternative-keys">Alternative keys</h2>
<p>With adequate evidence that Escape wouldn’t work for us, we started looking at other non-typing keys we could use.</p>
<p>Testing with the Control key (<kbd>⌃ Ctrl</kbd>) worked much better, avoiding virtually all of the pitfalls of Escape, but there were still a few cons to it.</p>
<p>Control conflicted with VoiceOver’s default configuration—where pressing Control mutes VoiceOver.</p>
<p>Control was also the only key of those we were considering that wasn’t in a physically consistent location on different UK keyboards: While on standalone keyboards the key tends to appear in the far bottom-left, on laptops it is commonly offset inwards to make room for an additional function key.</p>
<p>This innocuous difference had the potential to slow down a user’s ability to quickly activate the shortcut, especially if they were using unfamiliar hardware.</p>
<p>The Alt or Option keys (<kbd>⎇ Alt</kbd> or <kbd>⌥ Option</kbd>), by comparison, were more problematic.</p>
<p>Most obviously: It’s named differently on different systems. Guidance and help documentation would get rather more verbose if we had to constantly call it Alt, Option, Opt, the key with <kbd>⌥</kbd> on it, and so on in every instance.</p>
<p>The key’s use for typing letters with diacritics and other ‘alt codes’ meant that the keypresses reported to the browser weren’t always aligned with what physical keys the user had actually pressed, meaning we couldn’t be reliably sure if the user was intending to exit the page or not.</p>
<p>Alt/Option, like Escape, also had the issue of being utilised by some browser- and system-level functions, such as a shortcut to access application menus.</p>
<p>In Chromium browsers on Windows, for example, pressing Alt would move keyboard focus out of the webpage and to the browser UI—completely removing the user from the webpage context. This prevented subsequent key presses from being detected, and obviously made EtP functionality not work at all.</p>
<h2 id="shift-was-better%2C-but-it%E2%80%99s-still-not-perfect">Shift was better, but it’s still not perfect</h2>
<p>So we landed on <kbd>⇧ Shift</kbd>. Shift works more consistently than Escape did, but still has a bunch of caveats:</p>
<ul>
<li>Its use during normal typing meant needing to be careful about which presses actually counted towards activation.</li>
<li>Pressing Shift three times requires many more presses if the Sticky Keys accessibility features is active. I found that it took between 6 and 9 presses with Windows Sticky Keys, depending on speed, and 9 presses with macOS Sticky Keys.</li>
<li>macOS’s Slow Keys feature still takes three presses, but they have to be spread across a period of a few seconds to avoid activating the ‘latching’ functionality.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/FreedomScientific/standards-support/issues/699">The JAWS screen reader in Chromium would register the first Shift keypress twice</a>, though this has potentially been fixed since.</li>
<li>Using Shift means that the shortcut is available on touch device’s virtual keyboards. However, these keyboards tend to behave unpredictably compared to their hardware equivalents. I wrote up <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/issues/4095">a massive bug report just about how the Shift key behaves on iOS</a>, part of which subsequently became <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=273681">a bug report</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite these shortfalls, Shift was ultimately the least flawed of the choices presented to us, with most of its issues being fairly minor and none of them being showstopping.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>So that’s where we are now.</p>
<p>In some ways, this is an unfortunate case of technology and web standards working against what would be the ideal user experience. <kbd>Esc</kbd> <em>would</em> be the ideal key to use, but it has too many caveats to work consistently.</p>
<p>We looked into opening the redirection page in a new tab and automatically closing the previous tab, as some similar tools do, but user research found that this often caused confusion (‘Why doesn’t the back button work?’, ‘Where did my work go?’) and doing that is also subject to transient activation requirements.</p>
<p>We would’ve also liked to have had the button overwrite or erase the user’s recent browser history, but we can’t do that either. (And for good reason!)</p>
<p>Ultimately, we had to land on the philosophy of doing better, but not aiming for perfection. We could never write a piece of JavaScript that could prevent domestic violence, prying surveillance, or controlling relationships—we can only do what we can do.</p>
<p>No one has complained about us using Shift instead of Escape, nor have we received any bug reports about it not working, but it certainly raises an eyebrow when folks hear about it for the first time…</p>
<p>As for the other major question we get…</p>
<h2 id="bonus%3A-why-does-it-redirect-the-user-to-bbc-weather%3F">Bonus: Why does it redirect the user to BBC Weather?</h2>
<p>As civil servants, we didn’t want to link to a news service as that could lead to claims of political bias.</p>
<p>I also argued (a lot) against linking to the Google homepage—despite this being ridiculously common—because… who actually uses the Google homepage? Google search is right there in your URL bar.</p>
<p>Even if you do go to Google’s homepage, the first action you normally take once there is to leave Google’s homepage.</p>
<p>If you walked in on someone and they were nervously staring at Google’s homepage, you’d be suspicious as hell.</p>
<p>BBC Weather’s homepage is a content-rich page. Users have a reason to be looking at it and to be looking for an extended period of time. It may even default to the user’s location, displaying significantly more personalised content in the process, which is surely less suspicious than a blank, generic search form.</p>

            <p>
              Thought this was neat? Why not

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



<p><strong>2023-10-13:</strong> Edited based on feedback, but preserves
the same content.</p>
<p>This is a little summary of my current thoughts on Rust. I wonder
whether I’ll look back in five years and see if my views have
changed.</p>
<h2 id="the-good">The Good</h2>
<p>So that Gentle Reader knows that I’m not entirely biased against the
language, there are obviously positive things to appreciate about
it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rust’s macros are very good. They act like Lisp’s macros, unlike
Haskell’s.</li>
<li>The fact that Rust has type-classes (“traits”) and sum types
(“enums”) and pattern matching is very attractive. Making orphans
package-wide rather than module-wide is a very good decision.</li>
<li>I like its treatment of records.</li>
<li>Its standard library does a few things well, like handling strings
as UTF-8.</li>
<li>Distinguishing mutability has its advantages, it’s easy to see that
a function is “morally” pure–if not actually pure–and that’s good for
reading.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="unsafe-and-panic">Unsafe and panic</h2>
<p>The use of unsafe is a little disturbing, because many libraries
feature it, and people are tempted to use it on private work projects to
quickly get around the language’s limitations. But it’s not much
different to using an FFI. I don’t see this is a big downside.</p>
<p><code>panic</code> is a little more bothersome, because Rust
libraries go to great pains (with many syntactic tricks like
<code>?</code> and auto-conversions from smaller error types to larger
ones) to handle errors explicitly, but then panics unwind the stack to
the top of the process, and panics inside a panic don’t run destructors,
etc. The overall effect is that, like <a href="https://chrisdone.com/posts/three-questions-of-lang-design/">my
three questions of language design</a>, the answer to “how you handle
errors” is “at least two, incompatible ways.”</p>
<h2 id="take-sugar">Take Sugar?</h2>
<p>Rust’s use of magical sugar constructs, where the compiler will
automatically insert dereferences and copies and drops for you has an
initial appealing “it’s all simple underneath” quality to it, but in
practice this leads to bad compile errors: The worst kind of compile
error is the one where the compiler is complaining about something that
it generated for you, rather than something you explicitly wrote.</p>
<p>This can be compared with Haskell’s use of monads, that provide
syntactic sugar. The more magic you introduce, the harder it is for
newbies to learn and to talk about.</p>
<h2 id="fetishization-of-efficient-memory-representation">Fetishization
of Efficient Memory Representation</h2>
<p>I’ve watched people on calls that are a couple years into Rust spend
20 minutes attempting to understand why their perfectly reasonable code
doesn’t fit into Rust’s tight memory restrictions.</p>
<p>I’ve also been Rust-splained, by people with white in their hair,
with an air of misty-eyed revelation, that once you “get” Rust’s memory
model of the stack and the heap,<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> that things just all fit
together wonderfully. There’s nothing wrong with that, but it’s a
theme.</p>
<p>This touches on another topic I’d like to write about elsewhere: the
difference between practice and theory and how users of languages like
Rust and Haskell that make big promises and require big sacrifices don’t
seem to distinguish the difference. <a href="https://chrisdone.com/posts/reasoning-violently/">It’s not the
technology that’s working poorly, it’s that you’re using it
wrongly.</a></p>
<p>In practice, people just want to be able to write a tree-like type
without having to play Chess against the compiler. I predict that
tracing garbage collectors will become popular in Rust eventually.</p>
<p>This is both Rust’s main goal–be like C, no garbage collection,<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> but safe–and also its main downside.
People waste time on trivialities that will never make a difference.</p>
<h2 id="the-rewrite-fallacy">The Rewrite Fallacy</h2>
<p>I see a lot of “we rewrote X in Rust and it got faster” posts. I
think that if you rewrite anything from scratch with performance in
mind, you’ll see a significant performance improvement. I’m suspicious
of how much Rust itself is needed versus the developers having some
performance discipline.</p>
<h2 id="complexity">Complexity</h2>
<p>Rust has arrived at the complexity of Haskell and C++, each year
requiring more knowledge to keep up with the latest and greatest. Go was
designed as the antidote to this kind of endlessly increasing language
surface area. Endless libraries re-treading existing patterns (web
services, parsers, etc.) in Rust. As a long-term Haskeller, I’ve done
more than 15 years of riding a hamster wheel like that. It is fun for a
while, but at some point I grew tired of it. This aspect of Rust puts me
off. I don’t need another <a href="https://chrisdone.com/posts/tamagotchi-tooling/">tamagotchi</a>.</p>

<p>All new language communities are nice. When things don’t matter much,
people have no reason to get mad.</p>
<p>As soon as people have a stake in something, that’s when things heat
up and tempers come out. You get a stake in a programming language by
writing a lot of code in it, or by building a business on it. When you
have a stake in how a language works, you’re highly sensitive to changes
that will make you do more work than needed, or will limit your
goals.</p>
<p>I’ve seen this play out for Haskell. Around 2007, when I started with
Haskell, the community was friendly as anything, evangelic, open. People
praised it for this. Everyone just felt blessed to be able to use this
exciting language. Today, it’s more like any other community. What
happened? People started using Haskell for real, that’s all.</p>
<p>Rust is going through the same thing, much more rapidly. Is it a
reason to avoid Rust? No.&nbsp;But a “nice” community isn’t a reason to join
an upcoming language, either.</p>
<p>Since I wrote this, people are already trying to <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36122270">fork Rust</a>
because they’re not happy with the governance of it. This doesn’t mean
anything deep other than that people are using Rust now, as stated
above, and the “friendly, welcoming” starts to become mixed with more
diverse moods and motivations.</p>
<h2 id="async-is-highly-problematic">Async is highly problematic</h2>
<p>Rust’s choice to exclude a runtime/scheduler blessed and built-in to
the language means they had to develop alternative strategies in the
language itself. This is not turning out well.</p>
<p><a href="https://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2015/02/01/what-color-is-your-function/">Coloured
Functions</a> is a powerful metaphor for the incompatibility between
async and synchronous functions and the awkward situations that mixing
them introduces. Some blog posts have attempted to downplay the
situation by focusing on technical aspects of specific syntactic forms.
That doesn’t really matter, though, because the reality is much simpler:
Async code is easier to use when dependencies are in an async form.</p>
<p>People will choose libraries that are async over libraries that are
not. However, maintainers that have written good, maintained code, are
also resistant to adopt async.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>One conversation I’ve overhead:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Person 1: Another difference between diesel and sqlx is that diesel
is not async yet and from looking at the issues it doesn’t seem to be
priority yet.</p>
<p>Person 2: That sounds like a major issue</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
<p>As the saying goes, the proof of the pudding is in the eating of the
pudding. Async introduces <a href="https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/399">long, heated
discussions.</a></p>
<p>The problem for Rust is that its users want a runtime, but want the
option of not having one. The result is a mess. When combined with
iterators, I think understanding such code is quite difficult.</p>
<p>Generally, I think Go, Erlang and Haskell are the better choice here
for general purpose use. A tracing garbage collector and green threads
make programmers more productive for general purpose programming (not
systems programming). Which brings me to the next section.</p>
<h2 id="as-a-general-purpose-language">As a general purpose
language</h2>
<p>I feel like Rust is self-defined as a “systems” language, but it’s
being used to write web apps and command-line tools and all sorts of
things.</p>
<p>This is a little disappointing, but also predictable: the more
successful your language, the more people will use your language for
things it wasn’t intended for.</p>
<p>This post still offends <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/identity.html">many who have tied Rust
to their identity</a>, but that’s their problem, not mine.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions-if-any">Conclusions, if any</h2>
<p>I won’t be using Rust for any of my own personal projects for the
above stated reasons. But it was used at my job at the time of writing,
so I felt the need to express myself about it.</p>
<p>But I wouldn’t mind using it as a replacement for single-threaded C
if I just use the standard library, that might be fun, although I don’t
do any embedded work, so I wouldn’t hold my breath.</p>
<p>I think that the excellent tooling and dev team for Rust, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ3w_jec1v8">subsidized by Big
Tech</a>, pulls the wool over people’s eyes and convinces them that this
is a good language that is simple and worth investing in. There’s danger
in that type of thinking.</p>

<p>I have a noted love for vim, but when I’m not using an IDE with a vim mode, I’m actually typically using <a href="https://neovim.io/">neovim</a>, alias <code>nvim</code>, which is a modern reimplementation of vim with much less technical debt, a scripting engine based on Lua instead of notoriously-idiosyncratic vimscript, and reasonable defaults like syntax highlighting enabled by default. It also has a full implementation of the <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/">Language Server Protocol</a>, which enables it to have very rich, Visual Studio Code-esque plugins.</p>
<h2 id="fzf">fzf</h2>
<p><img src="https://rwblickhan.org/_astro/fzf-ctrlr.DNEwGTNf_Kl21s.webp" alt="fzf&amp;#x27;s Ctrl-R behavior in action" width="1600" height="729" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf"><code>fzf</code></a> is a command-line fuzzy finder; given some input, <code>fzf</code> lets you search through the input with a fuzzy matching search term. One use I find for this is my custom <code>git</code> alias for a fancy branch switcher, <code>git b</code>, which lets me fuzzy-search for branch names when I want to switch branches.</p>
<p><img src="https://rwblickhan.org/_astro/fzf.Dipf4UqV_woRP7.webp" alt="fzf in action" width="556" height="169" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></p>
<p>It’s also useful on its own! It can helpfully install a replacement for your terminal’s Ctrl+R to fuzzy-search previous commands, as well as a Ctrl+T command to fuzzy-search files in the current directory (although, to be honest, I usually find this option less than effective).</p>
<h2 id="bat">bat</h2>
<p><img src="https://rwblickhan.org/_astro/bat.DtgX936y_2cmkBM.webp" alt="bat in action" width="1108" height="372" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/sharkdp/bat"><code>bat</code></a> is described as a “<code>cat(1)</code> clone with wings”. <code>cat</code> is technically supposed to be for concatenating text, but more often it’s simply used to print a file to the command line. <code>bat</code> leans into that usage by automatically piping large files into a pager, as well as adding syntax highlighting and <code>git</code> integration. I have <code>cat</code> aliased to <code>bat</code>.</p>
<h2 id="exa">exa</h2>
<p><img src="https://rwblickhan.org/_astro/exa.ZHpQ3Ose_Z11HahG.webp" alt="exa in action" width="890" height="60" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></p>
<p><a href="https://the.exa.website/">exa</a> is a modern replacement for <code>ls</code>. Although I do think it has more reasonable defaults than <code>ls</code>, I really only use it for one reason: the <a href="https://the.exa.website/features/colours">pretty colours</a>! I have <code>ls</code> aliased to <code>exa</code>.</p>
<h2 id="rg">rg</h2>
<p><img src="https://rwblickhan.org/_astro/rg.1m6wfl9s_ZuAkTd.webp" alt="rg in action" width="1093" height="120" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep">ripgrep</a>, aka <code>rg</code>, is a grep tool; it allows you to efficiently search the full text of all files in a directory using regular expressions. Admittedly, it’s often more convenient to use a real IDE’s search function, but <code>rg</code> works everywhere and is <em>blazingly</em> fast.</p>
<h2 id="fd">fd</h2>
<p><img src="https://rwblickhan.org/_astro/fd.ih_TKBXW_Z1Mhfco.webp" alt="fd in action" width="491" height="108" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/sharkdp/fd"><code>fd</code></a> is a modern replacement for <code>find</code>. Unlike <code>rg</code>, which searches the full text of files, <code>fd</code> just searches filenames. This is useful in large codebases where you know roughly what a file is named but don’t know what directory it lives in. <code>fd</code> has a more intuitive command-line interface than <code>find</code> and even ignores files in your <code>.gitignore</code> by default! I have <code>find</code> aliased to <code>fd</code>.</p>
<p>Notably, some of this behavior is also provided by <code>fzf</code>, but I usually find <code>fd</code> much more effective in actually finding what I want.</p>
<h2 id="delta">delta</h2>
<p><img src="https://rwblickhan.org/_astro/delta.Htmui8Ik_11SL1S.webp" alt="delta in action" width="1113" height="250" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></p>
<p>Don’t you wish your command-line <code>git diff</code> was as pretty as Github? Well, now it can be! <a href="https://github.com/dandavison/delta"><code>delta</code></a> makes <code>git diff</code> output much prettier, with word-level highlighting, line numbers, and an optional side-by-side mode.</p>
<h2 id="tldr">tldr</h2>
<p><img src="https://rwblickhan.org/_astro/tldr.B6SViaeT_KS4xl.webp" alt="tldr in action" width="557" height="449" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></p>
<p><code>tldr</code> is a utility that provides community-maintained help pages for command-line tools, meant to complement traditional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_page">man pages</a>, which are typically verbose. Instead, <code>tldr</code> provides a quick cheat-sheet for common use cases. I use the <a href="https://github.com/dbrgn/tealdeer">tealdeer</a> implementation of <code>tldr</code>.</p>
<h2 id="zoxide">zoxide</h2>
<p>zoxide is a replacement for <code>cd</code>, inspired by <code>z</code>, that lets you jump around quickly. At a basic level, it can completely emulate the behavior of typical <code>cd</code>. However, you can also give it a fuzzy search term, and it will use a “frecency” algorithm to determine which directory, anywhere on your system, to jump to. I have <code>cd</code> aliased to <code>z</code>, the binary for zoxide.</p>
<p>zoxide also has an interactive mode that uses <code>fzf</code> to fuzzy-find recent directory paths. I have that functionality aliased to <code>cdi</code>, though I haven’t gotten in the habit of using it yet.</p>
<h2 id="httpie">httpie</h2>
<p><a href="https://httpie.io/cli">HTTPie</a> is a recent discovery. I don’t need to use <code>curl</code> very often to make HTTP requests, but when I do, it’s always a bit painful to remember the syntax. HTTPie has a much more obvious command-line interface and also built-in support for making HTTPS requests.</p> </article></div>]]></description>

<p>WordPress.org users are now required to agree that they are not affiliated with website hosting platform WP Engine before logging in. It’s the latest shot fired by WordPress co-creator Matt Mullenweg in his crusade against the website hosting platform.</p><p>The checkbox on the login page for WordPress.org asks users to confirm, “I am not affiliated with WP Engine in any way, financially or otherwise.” Users who don’t check that box can’t log in or register a new account. As of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20241008225626/https://login.wordpress.org/"><u>Tuesday</u></a>, that checkbox didn’t exist.&nbsp;</p><div><p>💡</p><p><b><strong>Are you a current or former Automattic employee or have anything to share about the WordPress versus WP Engine situation? I would love to hear from you. Using a non-work device, you can message me securely on Signal at sam.404. Otherwise, send me an email at sam@404media.co.</strong></b></p></div><p>Since last month, Mullenweg has been publicly accusing WP Engine of misusing the WordPress brand and not contributing enough to the open-source community. WP Engine sent him a cease and desist, and he and his company, Automattic, sent one back. He’s banned WP Engine from using WordPress’ resources, and as of today, some contributors are reporting being kicked out of the community Slack they use for WordPress open-source projects.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://www.404media.co/content/images/2024/10/image.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1039" height="709" srcset="https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w600/2024/10/image.png 600w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w1000/2024/10/image.png 1000w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/2024/10/image.png 1039w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>A screenshot of the WordPress.org login page as it appears on Oct. 9 at 1:50 p.m. EST</span></figcaption></figure><p>Among WordPress community contributors, who keep the open-source project running, this checkbox added to the organization’s site is an inflection point in the story of a legal battle that they’ve been mostly isolated from until today.&nbsp;</p><p>“Right now the WordPress community is in chaos. People don’t know where they stand legally, they are being banned from participating for speaking up, and Matt is promising more ‘surprises’ all week,” one WordPress open-source community member who has contributed to the project for more than 10 years told me. They requested to speak anonymously because they fear retribution from Mullenweg. “The saddest part is that while WordPress is a tool we use in our work, for many of us it is much more than a software. It is a true global community, made up of long-time friends and coworkers who share a love for the open-source project and its ideals. We are all having that very abruptly ripped away from us.”&nbsp;</p><p>In a Slack channel for WordPress community contributors, Mullenweg said on Wednesday that the checkbox is part of a ban on WP Engine from using WordPress.org’s resources. </p><figure><img src="https://www.404media.co/content/images/2024/10/image-1.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="655" height="773" srcset="https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w600/2024/10/image-1.png 600w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/2024/10/image-1.png 655w"><figcaption><span>Screenshot via </span><a href="https://x.com/JavierCasares/status/1843963071183880345?ref=404media.co" rel="noreferrer"><span>@JavierCasares on X</span></a></figcaption></figure><p>Mullenweg explained the ban <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2024/09/wp-engine-banned/?ref=404media.co"><u>in a blog post</u></a> published on the WordPress.org site in September, saying it’s "because of their legal claims and litigation against WordPress.org.” (WP Engine named Automattic and Mullenweg as defendants in its lawsuit, which we'll get to in a moment, but not WordPress.org or the WordPress Foundation.)</p><p>“WP Engine is free to offer their hacked up, bastardized simulacra of WordPress’s GPL code to their customers, and they can experience WordPress as WP Engine envisions it, with them getting all of the profits and providing all of the services,” Mullenweg wrote in the blog. “If you want to experience WordPress, use any other host in the world besides WP Engine.”&nbsp;</p><p>WP Engine is an independent company and platform that hosts sites built on WordPress. WordPress.org is an open-source project, while WordPress.com is the commercial entity owned by Automattic, and which funds development of, and contributes to, the WordPress codebase. Last month, Mullenweg—who also co-founded Automattic—wrote <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2024/09/wp-engine/?ref=404media.co"><u>a post on the organization’s blog</u></a>, calling WP Engine a “cancer to WordPress” and accusing WP Engine of “strip-mining the WordPress ecosystem, giving our users a crappier experience so they can make more money” because the platform disables revision history tracking.</p><p>Mullenweg also criticized WP Engine for not contributing enough to the WordPress open source project, and its use of “WP” in its branding. “Their branding, marketing, advertising, and entire promise to customers is that they’re giving you WordPress, but they’re not. And they’re profiting off of the confusion,” he wrote. “WP Engine needs a trademark license to continue their business.” He also devoted most of <a href="https://youtu.be/fnI-QcVSwMU?si=3v7bDAXpaOaa21eE&amp;ref=404media.co"><u>a WordCamp conference talk</u></a> to his qualms with WP Engine and its investor Silver Lake.</p><p>WP Engine sent Automattic and Mullenweg a cease and desist letter demanding that he “stop making and retract false, harmful and disparaging statements against WP Engine,” the platform posted in September.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Today WP Engine sent what is called a “cease and desist” letter to Automattic demanding that Automattic and its CEO Matt Mullenweg stop making and retract false, harmful and disparaging statements against WP Engine.

</figure><p><a href="https://wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Cease-and-Desist-Letter-to-Automattic-and-Request-to-Preserve-Documents-Sent.pdf?ref=404media.co"><u>The letter</u></a> claimed that Mullenweg “threatened that if WP Engine did not agree to pay Automattic—his for-profit entity—a very large sum of money before his September 20th keynote address at the WordCamp US Convention, he was going to embark on a self-described ‘scorched earth nuclear approach’ toward WP Engine within the WordPress community and beyond.”</p><p>Automattic <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/25/legal-ping-pong-in-the-wordpress-world-continues-automattic-now-sends-wp-engine-a-cease-and-desist-letter-alleging-trademark-infringement/?ref=404media.co"><u>lobbed its own cease and desist</u></a> back. “Your unauthorized use of our Client’s trademarks infringes on their rights and dilutes their famous and well-known marks. Negative reviews and comments regarding WP Engine and its offerings are imputed to our Client, thereby tarnishing our Client’s brands, harming their reputation, and damaging the goodwill our Client has established in its marks,” <a href="https://automattic.com/2024/wp-engine-cease-and-desist.pdf?ref=404media.co"><u>the letter states.</u></a> “Your unauthorized use of our Client’s intellectual property has enabled WP Engine to compete with our Client unfairly, and has led to unjust enrichment and undue profits.”&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://wordpressfoundation.org/trademark-policy/?ref=404media.co"><u>The WordPress Foundation’s Trademark Policy page</u></a> was also changed in late September to specifically name WP Engine. “The abbreviation ‘WP’ is not covered by the WordPress trademarks, but please don’t use it in a way that confuses people,” it now says. “For example, many people think WP Engine is ‘WordPress Engine’ and officially associated with WordPress, which it’s not. They have never once even donated to the WordPress Foundation, despite making billions of revenue on top of WordPress.”</p><p>WP Engine filed a lawsuit against Automattic and Mullenweg earlier this month, accusing them of extortion and abuse of power, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/02/wp-engine-sues-automattic-and-wordpress-co-founder-matt-mullenweg/?ref=404media.co" rel="noreferrer">Techcrunch reported.</a></p><p>Last week, Mullenweg <a href="https://ma.tt/2024/10/alignment?ref=404media.co"><u>announced</u></a> that he’d given Automattic employees a buyout package, and 159 employees, or roughly 8.4 percent of staff, took the offer. “I feel much lighter,” he wrote.</p><p>According to screenshots posted by WordPress project contributors, there’s a heated debate happening in the WordPress community Slack at the moment—between contributors and Mullenweg himself—about the checkbox. </p><p>One contributor wrote that they have a day job as an agency developer, which involves working on sites that might be hosted by WP Engine.&nbsp;“That's as far as my association goes. However, ‘financially or otherwise’ is quite vague and therefore confusing,” they wrote. “For example, people form relationships at events, are former employees, collaborate on a project, contribute to a plugin, or have some other connection that could be considered impactful to whether that checkbox is checked. What's the base level of interaction/association that would mean not checking that box?”&nbsp;</p><p>Mullenweg replied: “It’s up to you whether to check the box or not. I can’t answer that for you.”&nbsp;</p><p>At least two WordPress open-source project contributors—Javier Casares and Andrew Hutchings—posted on X that they’ve been kicked out of the WordPress community Slack after questioning Mullenweg’s actions.</p><figure><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Well, I'm now banned from the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WordPress?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=404media.co">#WordPress</a> community. That is a first for me. I don't think I've ever been banned from an open source community before.<br>For my friends still there, stay safe and I hope you don't get too impacted by the fallout of what is going on.</p>— Andrew Hutchings (@LinuxJedi) <a href="https://twitter.com/LinuxJedi/status/1843966957495939093?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=404media.co">October 9, 2024</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>“A few of us asked Matt questions on Slack about the new checkbox on the .org login,” Hutchings posted. “I guess we shouldn't have done that.”</p><p>“In today's case, somebody changed the login and disconnected everybody, so, without explanation on the check, if you need to contribute to WordPress and access the website, you need to activate it,” Casares told me in an email. “In my case, this morning, I had to publish a post about a Hosting Team meeting this afternoon.” He had to check the box, he said, because without it he couldn’t access the platform to post it, but the vagueness of the statement concerned him.</p><p>He said the people banned this morning included contributors who have been contributing to the WordPress project for more than 10 years, or people related to other source-code projects.</p><p>“Why? Only Matt knows why he is doing everything he is doing. I really don't know,” Casares&nbsp;said.&nbsp;</p><p>“Matt’s war against WP Engine has been polarizing and upsetting for everyone in WordPress, but most of the WP community has been relatively insulated from any real effects. Putting a loyalty test in the form of a checkmark on the WordPress.org login page has brought the conflict directly to every community member and contributor. Matt is not just forcing everyone to take sides, he is actively telling people to consult attorneys to determine whether or not they should check the box,” the anonymous contributor I spoke to told me. “It is also more than just whether or not you agree to a legally dubious statement to log in. A growing number of active, dedicated community members, many who have no connection with WP Engine, have had their WordPress.org accounts completely disabled with no notice or explanation as to why. No one knows who will be banned next or for what... Whatever Matt’s end goal is, his ‘tactics,’ especially this legally and ethically ambiguous checkbox, are causing a lot of confusion and mental anguish to people around the world.”</p><p>Based on entries to his <a href="https://ma.tt/2024/10/rhino-dehorning/?ref=404media.co"><u>personal blog</u></a> and <a href="https://www.threads.net/@photomatt/post/DA0WWnTsESD?ref=404media.co"><u>social media posts</u></a>, Mullenweg has been on safari in Africa this week. Mullenweg did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Middlewares</h2><a id="user-content-middlewares" aria-label="Permalink: Middlewares" href="#middlewares"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Dito supports custom middlewares, which can be specified in the configuration. Currently available middleware includes:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>auth</code>: Adds authentication logic.</li>
<li><code>rate-limiter</code>: Limits the number of requests per IP using an in-memory approach.</li>
<li><code>rate-limiter-redis</code>: Limits the number of requests per IP using Redis for distributed management.</li>
<li><code>cache</code>: Caches responses using Redis, improving performance for idempotent responses (e.g., GET).</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Redis Integration</h2><a id="user-content-redis-integration" aria-label="Permalink: Redis Integration" href="#redis-integration"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Rate Limiting</h3><a id="user-content-rate-limiting" aria-label="Permalink: Rate Limiting" href="#rate-limiting"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Dito supports distributed rate limiting using Redis. The rate limiter can be configured per location with parameters like <code>requests_per_second</code> and <code>burst</code> to control the request flow.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Caching</h3><a id="user-content-caching" aria-label="Permalink: Caching" href="#caching"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The <code>cache</code> middleware uses Redis to store responses. It helps in reducing load on backends by caching responses for a configurable <code>ttl</code> (time-to-live). The cache can be invalidated based on request headers or specific conditions.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Implementing a New Middleware</h3><a id="user-content-implementing-a-new-middleware" aria-label="Permalink: Implementing a New Middleware" href="#implementing-a-new-middleware"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">To implement a new middleware, place your logic in the <code>middlewares/</code> directory and reference it in the configuration.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">TLS/SSL</h2><a id="user-content-tlsssl" aria-label="Permalink: TLS/SSL" href="#tlsssl"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Dito supports mTLS (mutual TLS) for secure connections to backends. You can specify:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>cert_file</code>: The client certificate.</li>
<li><code>key_file</code>: The client private key.</li>
<li><code>ca_file</code>: The certificate authority (CA) for verifying the backend.</li>

        <p>Last month, the UBL announced that it will deselect an extensive collection of foreign dissertations. We are happy to report now that The Internet Archive will be taking over this collection.</p>
        <div>
<p><span><span>The dissertations were originally part of an exchange programme between (mostly European) universities until the year 2004 but were never catalogued on arrival</span></span><span><span>. </span></span><span><span>As Leiden University Libraries has limited space for growth in its stacks</span></span><span><span>, it decided to deselect these dissertations, so that 3.2 km could be freed up for new acquisitions. The universities where these dissertations originally were defended informed UBL that they still have the dissertations and were not interested in receiving back the Leiden copy. The Internet Archive will now take over this collection from the UBL, and will take care of its future preservation and access. The UBL is pleased that The Internet Archive is able to give this collection of foreign dissertations a second life.</span></span></p>    <!-- Image block 1.0 -->

<p data-hk="00000001000000000000400020">There is a geometric thought experiment that is often used to demonstrate the counterintuitive shape of high-dimensional phenomena. This article is an interactive visual journey into the construct in the thought experiment, and the mathematics behind it.</p>

There are four blue circles, with a radius of one, packed into the box. One in each corner.
At the center of the box is a red circle. The red circle is as large as it can be, without overlapping the blue circles.
Drag the slider to add a third dimension.
On this and all other 3D diagrams, you can drag the image to rotate it, and scroll to zoom.</p>

<p data-hk="000000010000000000004000a290">When extending the construct to 3D, many things happen.
All the circles are now spheres, the red sphere is larger while the blue spheres aren’t,
and there are eight spheres while there were only four circles.</p>
<p data-hk="000000010000000000004000a300">The dimensional extension is decomposed into three phases.
First, the circles and square turn into spheres and a cube.
Next, the central ball grows, and everything else shifts so that it ends in the center.
Finally, four new spheres appear, completing the 3D version of the construct.</p>

We see that when we rotate the plane along the center of the left balls, the balls on the right, vanish and are replaced—within the plane—by the two balls, diagonally across.
There are a few important behaviors to note from this interactable.</p>

As visualizing higher dimensions is not intuitive, we can’t rely on a lower dimensional intersection of a higher dimensional object to guide us.

I don’t think the analogy is good.
A 3D sphere is perfectly circular, no matter how you slice it.
Similarly, an n-dimensional hyperball, is perfectly spherical from all perspectives.
It’s ballness just reaches into more hard to grasp dimensions than we’re used to.</p>

Intuitively, a sphere and a cylinder are both 3D extensions of a circle.
There is more volume in the cylinder than the sphere.
With some imprecision, we can thus consider the sphere loosing some volume when a dimension is added, while a cylinder or a box do not.
This <em data-hk="000000010000000000004000b5610">volume loss</em> occurs in every additional dimension.
So instead of considering n-balls to be spiky, it’s the space around them that outgrows them.</p>

<p>As the evil twin of <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-758-allow-except-and-except-expressions-without-parentheses/66453">PEP 758: Allow `except` and `except*` expressions without parentheses</a>, <a href="https://discuss.python.org/u/brettcannon">@brettcannon</a> and me present you <strong>PEP 760: No more bare excepts</strong>.</p>
<p>This PEP proposes disallowing bare <code>except:</code> clauses in Python’s exception-handling syntax. Currently, Python allows catching all exceptions with a bare <code>except:</code> clause, which can lead to overly broad exception handling and mask important errors. This PEP suggests requiring explicit exception types in all except clauses, promoting more precise and intentional error handling.</p>
<p>Please <strong>review the entire document</strong> before commenting as it contains several aspects of how to address the deprecation, tooling, rejected ideas and more.</p>

<p>I know this is off-topic for <em>this</em> thread, but I raised this as an issue with the PEP 760 PR (the PEP itself hasn’t been published yet).  I haven’t had time to look at the response from the PEP authors, but I would really like to preserve bare-<code>except</code> with an unconditional <code>raise</code> use case.  If that can’t be done, I suggested an alias for <code>BaseException</code> called <code>AnyException</code> so at least the modified code would read better:</p>
<pre data-code-wrap="python"><code>try:
    something()
except:
     transaction.abort()
     raise
else:
     transaction.commit()

<p>Can I ask why? I don’t find that any clearer than <code>except BaseException</code>, and if you are using that pattern I feel you should understand what you’re doing. As such, I don’t think learning what <code>BaseException</code> means is too much to ask.</p>

<p>It’s the comma <em>in the appropriate contex</em>; not every comma makes a tuple, but you can’t syntactically make a tuple without a comma.</p>

<p><code>BaseException</code> exposes the fact that it’s the root class in the exception hierarchy, and you have to connect that mentally to the fact that a) Python requires all exceptions to derive from it, and b) that pattern means “catch any exception”.  The latter just makes that obvious.  It’s obvious to <em>us</em> of course either way.</p>
<p>For me, I’d still prefer to allow a bare <code>except</code> if there’s an explicit empty <code>raise</code> in the body.</p>

<p>It would be nice to not have to use <code>sys</code>. What if we added an option to bind the exception in a <code>finally</code> block, as in:</p>
<pre data-code-wrap="python"><code>try:
    raise Exception("Hello")
finally e:
    if e is not None:
        e.add_note("World")
</code></pre>

              <p>+1 to keeping bare <code>except:</code> with <code>raise</code>.<br>
For better or worse, it’s correct, idiomatic code; the “Motivation” reasons don’t really apply to it.<br>
<code>pylint</code> and <code>ruff</code> allow this, and the the style guides their docs link to (PEP-8 and the <a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#24-exceptions">Google style guide</a>) also mention that it’s OK.

<p>Although it’s straightforward the implementation would be quite verbose as this implies doing an entire ast visitor just to detect raises below the bare except (in C).</p>
<p>The task becomes much simpler if we restrict it to detecting raises only at the same level of nesting but that feels somewhat odd.</p>
<p>I think this is an interesting case but you could skip all of this by just doing except BaseException and then all is good.</p>

            <p>This breaks so much existing code. Does the benefit outweigh this? IMHO it’s OK to emit warnings left and right, but outright rejecting bare excepts after just 3 releases of deprecation period seems… not cool. Please, be more conservative with breaking backward compatibility of the basic language. This is not an API of one standard library module, this is the Python language itself.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p>A relaxation of official rules around the correct use of apostrophes in German has not only irritated grammar sticklers but triggered existential fears around the pervasive influence of English.</p><p>Establishments that feature their owners’ names, with signs like “Rosi’s Bar” or “Kati’s Kiosk” are a common sight around German towns and cities, but strictly speaking they are wrong: unlike English, German does not traditionally use apostrophes to indicate the genitive case or possession. The correct spelling, therefore, would be “Rosis Bar”, “Katis Kiosk”, or, as in the title of a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/29/how-viral-tongue-twister-lightened-up-german-language" data-link-name="in body link">recent viral hit</a>, Barbaras Rhabarberbar.</p><p>However, guidelines issued by the body regulating the use of Standard High German orthography have clarified that the use of the punctuation mark colloquially known as the <em>Deppenapostroph</em><em> </em>(“idiot’s apostrophe”) has become so widespread that it is permissible – as long as it separates the genitive ‘s’ within a proper name.</p><p>The new edition of the Council for German Orthography’s style guide, which prescribes grammar use at schools and public bodies in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/germany" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Germany</a>, Austria and German-speaking Switzerland, lists “Eva’s Blumenladen” (Eva’s Flower Shop) and “Peter’s Taverne” (Peter’s Tavern) as usable alternatives, though “Eva’s Brille” (“Eva’s glasses”) remains incorrect.</p><p>The <em>Deppenapostroph </em>is not to be confused with the English greengrocer’s apostrophe, when an apostrophe before an ‘s’ is mistakenly used to form the plural of a noun (“a kilo of potato’s”).</p><p>The new set of rules came into effect in July, and the council said a loosening of the rules in 1996 meant that “Rosi’s Bar” had strictly speaking not been incorrect for almost three decades. Yet over the past few days, German newspapers and social media networks have seen a pedants’ revolt against the loosening of grammar rules.</p><p>A commentator in the tabloid Bild said seeing signs like “Harald’s Eck” (“Harald’s Corner”) made his “hair stand on end”, and that the proper use of the genitive form would be bemoaned by lovers of the German language.</p><p>A columnist in the venerable broadsheet the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung decried the council’s decision as further proof of the English language’s “victory march”, while one newspaper editor on LinkedIn complained that legalising the “idiot’s apostrophe” amounted to “genuflecting to English”.</p><p>Some linguists question whether the rise of the possessive apostrophe has much to do with the influence of English at all, however.</p><p>“The familiarity of English names may be a factor, but it could just as well stem from a desire to avoid confusion”, said Anatol Stefanowitsch, a linguist at Berlin’s Freie Universität. “What we tend to see when a language interacts with another prestige language is that it incorporates its vocabulary, and not grammar.”</p><figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement"><a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-10">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p id="EmailSignup-skip-link-10" tabindex="0" aria-label="after newsletter promotion" role="note">after newsletter promotion</p></figure><p>Even before the rule clarification, the German orthographic council permitted the use of the possessive apostrophe for the sake of clarity, such as “Andrea’s Bar” to make clear that the owner is called Andrea and not Andreas.</p><p>“There is a long tradition of conservative circles fretting about international influences on the German languages,” said Stefanowitsch. “It used to be French, and now it’s mainly English”.</p><p>The Dortmund-based association Verein Deutsche Sprache tries to counteract the influence of English with an “anglicism index” that proposes alternative German words, such as <em>Klapprechner</em><em> </em>instead of “laptop” or <em>Puffmais</em><em> </em>instead of “popcorn”.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>9 October 2024</p>
<p><a href="http://www.kva.se/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences</a> has decided to award the Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2024</p>
<p>with one half to</p>
<p><strong>David Baker</strong><br>University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA</p>
<p><em>“for computational protein design”</em></p>
<p>and the other half jointly to</p>
<p><strong>Demis Hassabis</strong><br>Google DeepMind, London, UK</p>
<p><strong>John M. Jumper</strong><br>Google DeepMind, London, UK</p>
<p><em>“for protein structure prediction”</em></p>
<h2>They cracked the code for proteins’ amazing structures</h2>
<p>The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2024 is about pro­teins, life’s ingenious chemical tools. David Baker has succeeded with the almost impossible feat of building entirely new kinds of proteins. Demis Hassabis and John Jumper have developed an AI model to solve a 50-year-old problem: predicting proteins’ complex structures. These discoveries hold enormous potential.</p>
<p>The diversity of life testifies to proteins’ amazing capacity as chemical tools. They control and drive all the chemi­cal reactions that together are the basis of life. Proteins also function as hormones, signal substances, antibodies and the building blocks of different tissues.</p>
<p>“One of the discoveries being recognised this year concerns the construction of spectacular proteins. The other is about fulfilling a 50-year-old dream: predicting protein structures from their amino acid sequences. Both of these discoveries open up vast possibilities,” says Heiner Linke, Chair of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry.</p>
<p>Proteins generally consist of 20 different amino acids, which can be described as life’s building blocks. In 2003, <strong>David Baker</strong> succeeded in using these blocks to design a new protein that was unlike any other protein. Since then, his research group has produced one imaginative protein creation after another, including proteins that can be used as pharmaceuticals, vaccines, nanomaterials and tiny sensors.</p>
<p>The second discovery concerns the prediction of protein structures. In proteins, amino acids are linked together in long strings that fold up to make a three-dimensional structure, which is decisive for the protein’s function. Since the 1970s, researchers had tried to predict protein structures from amino acid sequences, but this was notoriously difficult. However, four years ago, there was a stunning breakthrough.</p>
<p>In 2020, <strong>Demis Hassabis</strong> and <strong>John Jumper</strong> presented an AI model called AlphaFold2. With its help, they have been able to predict the structure of virtually all the 200 million proteins that researchers have identified. Since their breakthrough, AlphaFold2 has been used by more than two million people from 190 countries. Among a myriad of scientific applications, researchers can now better understand antibiotic resistance and create images of enzymes that can decompose plastic.</p>
<p>Life could not exist without proteins. That we can now predict protein structures and design our own proteins confers the greatest benefit to humankind.</p>

<p><em>MARK SURMAN, PRESIDENT, MOZILLA</em></p>



<p>Keeping the internet, and the content that makes it a vital and vibrant part of our global society, free and accessible has been a core focus for Mozilla from our founding. How do we ensure creators get paid for their work? How do we prevent huge segments of the world from being priced out of access through paywalls? How do we ensure that privacy is not a privilege of the few but a fundamental right available to everyone? These are significant and enduring questions that have no single answer. But, for right now on the internet of today, a big part of the answer is <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/products/anonym-technology-overview/">online advertising</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/building-a-more-privacy-preserving-ads-based-ecosystem/">started</a> engaging in this space because the way the industry works today is fundamentally broken. It doesn’t put people first, it’s not privacy-respecting, and it’s increasingly anti-competitive. There have to be better options. Mozilla can play a key role in creating these better options not just by advocating for them, but also by actually building them. We can’t just ignore online advertising — it’s a major driver of how the internet works and is funded. We need to stare it straight in the eyes and try to fix it. For those reasons, Mozilla has become more <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/the-future-of-ads-and-privacy/">active</a> in online advertising over the past few years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We have the beginnings of a theory on what fixing it might look like — a mix of different business practices, technology, products, and public policy engagements. And we have started to do work on all of these fronts. It’s been clear to us in recent weeks that what we haven’t done is step back to explain our thinking in the broader context of our advertising efforts. For this, we owe our community an apology for not engaging and communicating our vision effectively. Mozilla is only Mozilla if we share our thinking, engage people along the way, and incorporate that feedback into our efforts to help reform the ecosystem.</p>



<p>We’re going to correct that, starting with this blog post. I want to lay out our thinking about how we plan to shift the world of online advertising in a better direction.</p>



<h2><strong>Our theory&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>As we say in our <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/">Manifesto</a>: “…a balance between commercial profit and public benefit is critical … “ to creating an open, healthy internet. Through that balance, we can have an internet that protects privacy and access, while encouraging a vibrant market that rewards creativity and innovation. But that’s not what we have in online advertising today.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our theory for improving online advertising requires work across three areas that relate to and build upon one another:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Regulation: </strong>Over the years, improving<a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/netpolicy/2024/07/17/mozillas-policy-vision-for-the-new-eu-mandate-advancing-openness-privacy-fair-competition-and-choice-for-all/"> privacy</a> and<a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/netpolicy/2024/07/17/mozillas-policy-vision-for-the-new-eu-mandate-advancing-openness-privacy-fair-competition-and-choice-for-all/"> consumer protection</a> in advertising while enabling<a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/netpolicy/2022/04/12/competition-should-not-be-weaponized-to-hobble-privacy-protections-on-the-open-web/"> competition</a> has been at the core of our policy efforts. From <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/netpolicy/2021/12/17/privacy-sandbox-cma-dec2021/">pushing</a> to improve Google’s Privacy Sandbox proposals via engaging with the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) in the UK to<a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/netpolicy/2024/01/11/mozilla-weighs-in-on-state-comprehensive-privacy-proposals/"> advocating</a> for strong protections for universal opt-out mechanisms via state privacy laws in the United States, we have a long history of supporting legislation that puts users in more meaningful control of their data. We recognise that technology can only get us so far and needs to work hand-in-hand with legislation to fix the most egregious practices in the ecosystem. With the upcoming new mandate in the European Commission expected to focus on advertising and the push for a federal privacy legislation in the United States reaching a fever pitch, we intend to build upon this work to continue pushing for better privacy protections.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Standards:</strong> As a pioneer in shaping internet standards, Mozilla has always played a central role in crafting technical specifications that support an open, competitive, and privacy-respecting web. We are bringing this same expertise and commitment to the advertising space. At the Internet Engineering Task Force (<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-ppm-dap/">IETF</a>) and World Wide Web Consortium (<a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/privacy-preserving-attribution-for-advertising/">W3C</a>), Mozilla is actively involved in advancing cutting-edge proposals for privacy-preserving advertising. This includes collaborating on Interoperable Private Attribution (<a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/privacy-preserving-attribution-for-advertising/">IPA</a>) and contributing to the Private Advertising Technology Community Group (<a href="https://www.w3.org/community/patcg/">PATCG</a>). The goal of this work is to identify legitimate, lawful, and non-harmful use cases and promote a healthy web by developing privacy-respecting technical mechanisms for those use cases. This would make it practical to more strictly limit the most invasive practices like ubiquitous third-party cookies.</li>



<li><strong>Products</strong>: Building things is the only way for Mozilla to prove these hypotheses. For years, Mozilla products have supported an advertising business without the privacy-invasive techniques common today by deploying features such as <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/firefox-rolls-out-total-cookie-protection-by-default-to-all-users-worldwide/">Total Cookie Protection</a> and<a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/products/firefox/firefox-now-available-with-enhanced-tracking-protection-by-default/"> Enhanced Tracking Protection</a> to protect our users. And we’ll continue to explore ways to add advertiser value while respecting user privacy – including by exploring how we can support other businesses in achieving these goals via <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/mozilla-anonym-raising-the-bar-for-privacy-preserving-digital-advertising/">Anonym</a>. Our goal is to build a model to demonstrate how ads can sustain a business online while respecting people’s privacy. Laura expands upon our approach in <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/improving-online-advertising/">her blog</a>.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>We have work underway right now across all three of these areas, with much more to come in the weeks and months ahead.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>The way forward —&nbsp;together</h2>



<p>This theory, and the work to test it, will become an increasingly integral part of the discussions we already have underway with regulators and civil society, consumers and developers, and advertisers, publishers and platforms. We will continue to set up gatherings, share research, and explore new ways to collectively share ideas and move this ahead for all of us – both shaping and being shaped by the ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fixing the problems with online advertising feels like an intractable challenge. Having been fortunate enough to be part of Mozilla for well over a decade, I am excited to tackle this challenge head on. It’s an opportunity for us to bring a whole community — including often divergent voices from advertising, technology, government and civil society — to the table to look for a better way. Personally, I don’t see a world where online advertising disappears —&nbsp;ads have been a key part of funding creators and publishers in every era from newspapers to radio to television. However, I can imagine a world where advertising online happens in a way that respects all of us, and where commercial and public interests are in balance. That’s a world I want to help build. &nbsp;</p>
