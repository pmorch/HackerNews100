    </div><p>Patients are more likely to fall, get new infections, or experience other forms of harm during their stay in a hospital after it is acquired by a private equity firm, according to a new study led by researchers at Harvard Medical School.</p>

                                        
                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                    <p>The research, <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/10.1001/jama.2023.23147?guestAccessKey=e0cef9be-d55c-4bcf-8892-412af8f24355">published</a> Dec. 26 in <i>JAMA</i>, is among a handful of recent nationwide analyses of how <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/private+equity/" rel="tag">private equity</a> takeovers affect the quality of patient care in hospitals. The increases are seen in conditions or outcomes deemed preventable and are key measures of hospital safety and quality.</p>
<p>The findings come amid growing concerns about private <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/equity/" rel="tag">equity</a>'s increasing role in U.S. health care, with <a href="https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/explainer/2023/nov/private-equity-role-health-care">$1 trillion invested in the past decade</a>.</p>
<p>"We had previously found that private equity acquisitions led to higher charges, prices, and societal spending," said Zirui Song, associate professor of health care policy and medicine in the Blavatnik Institute and director of research in the Center for Primary Care at HMS. "Now, we're learning that there are also downstream concerns for the clinical quality of care delivered to <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/hospital+patients/" rel="tag">hospital patients</a>."</p>
<p>The researchers said the findings are alarming because they may reflect bottom-line incentives overshadowing patient care and safety.</p>
<p>"Hospital success is measured not only in dollars or the number of patients who pass through the doors, but also in lives saved, complication rates, patient satisfaction, and a number of other quality and safety metrics," said HMS research fellow Sneha Kannan, a physician in the Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care at Massachusetts General Hospital. "We need to make sure we fully understand the costs and benefits of this prominent new force in health care."</p>
<p>The economic repercussions of private equity acquisitions are not a new concern. Previous studies by Song and co-author Joseph Dov Bruch of the University of Chicago indicate that this high-debt, for-profit financial model of hospital ownership may also lead <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2769549">to increased spending</a> and <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama-health-forum/fullarticle/2795946">other economic implications</a>. Many have expressed concerns about hospital bankruptcies under private equity ownership that often leave underserved populations with limited access to care. But up until now, the effects of private equity deals on <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/382/bmj-2023-075244">patient health and quality of care</a> have remained understudied and poorly understood.</p>

                                                                                                        <!-- Google middle Adsense block -->
    
                                                                                                                                            <h2>Why private equity is different</h2>
<p>"When health systems buy hospitals, they generally do not use borrowed money," said Song, who is also an internal medicine physician at Mass General. "In contrast, the classic private equity buyout uses a small amount of cash, but a large amount of debt."</p>
<p>A <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/private+equity+firm/" rel="tag">private equity firm</a> raises some capital from investors and borrows the rest, putting debt on the acquired hospital with its physical assets, such as land and buildings, as collateral for the loan. The acquired hospital must then generate revenue to pay down that debt.</p>
<p>Private equity generates revenue by charging management fees to its investors—commonly, pension funds, endowments, and other institutions or individuals—as well as by focusing on high-revenue procedures, cost-cutting, reorganization, and financial engineering.</p>
<p>One argument in favor of private equity investments is that many struggling hospitals need capital and management expertise. However, most private equity buyouts are of successful operations. Private equity firms want to buy going concerns that are able to take on debt and generate revenue in the short run. These <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/financial+pressures/" rel="tag">financial pressures</a> can create perverse incentives favoring profit over patients, the researchers say.</p>

                                                                                                                                            <h2>Private equity and quality of care</h2>
<p>For this study, the researchers examined insurance claims data for all fee-for-service Medicare hospitalizations from 2009 to 2019, totaling more than 600,000 hospitalizations at 51 private equity hospitals and more than 4 million hospitalizations at 259 similar hospitals not acquired by private equity. The hospitals not acquired by private equity served as the control group to control for other factors that may have affected outcomes.</p>
<p>The researchers compared how often patients experienced certain outcomes before and after the hospital was acquired by private equity. For example, they looked at how often patients fell while in the hospital or how often they developed an infection after a procedure or a surgery. The team also analyzed the makeup of the patient populations and various other outcomes such as how often patients died, how long they stayed at the hospital, and how often they ended up readmitted after leaving the hospital.</p>
<p>After a hospital was acquired by private equity, admitted Medicare patients had a 25% increase in hospital-acquired complications, compared with patients admitted before acquisition. Patients also had 27% more falls and 38% more bloodstream infections caused by central lines, which are temporary surgically inserted ports that allow easy intravenous access for patients receiving repeated drug infusions or other treatments.</p>
<p>The increase was seen despite private equity hospitals' placing 16% fewer central lines than before the buyout. All of these results were calculated while taking into account changes, trends, and patterns over the same period of time at peer hospitals not owned by private equity to isolate the differences that were due to the change in ownership.</p>
<p>Curiously, the study found a small drop in hospital deaths at private equity hospitals. This, the researchers said, may be due to social and demographic factors—private equity patients were younger and less disadvantaged than those at peer hospitals not owned by private equity. It may also be due to patients getting transferred more often out of private equity hospitals. When the researchers followed patients longer after discharge, the small decrease in deaths dissipated within a month after leaving the hospital.</p>

                                                                                                        <!-- Google middle Adsense block -->
    
                                                                                                                                            <h2>Framework for policy solutions</h2>
<p>Policymakers, insurance companies, and public sector bodies have grown increasingly concerned about protecting patients and societal resources from the effects of private equity transactions.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Song and Christopher Cai, a HMS clinical fellow in medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital, outlined <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2804025">such a policy framework</a> in a <i>JAMA</i> viewpoint article, which included regulating fraud and abuse, increasing antitrust oversight, reducing moral hazard (such as by lowering the debt used in acquisitions), protecting against inflated prices, and transparency in reporting of private equity acquisitions.</p>
<p>Currently, only private equity acquisitions over $111.4 million must be reported. This threshold may capture many hospital acquisitions but leaves out most acquisitions of physician practices.</p>
<p>"Private equity firms have historically operated in the shadows in health care," Kannan said. "Going forward, it's important to lift the veil and increase transparency."</p>
<p>And both researchers and policymakers should be rigorous in their efforts to understand how private equity changes health care operations and the downstream consequences, the authors cautioned.</p>
<p>"Patients and providers, investors and taxpayers, employers and insurers, all have a stake in this," Song said. "Understanding what the corporatization of health care delivery means is a goal shared by many across society."</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			
			<h2>Shiny new things</h2>
<p>Introducing a brand new editor for Markdown tables. Table rows and columns are now easier to create, edit, sort, reorder, select, copy, and paste. These new table features can also be accessed via context menu, command palette, and hotkeys. Tables are still saved to plain text Markdown.</p>

<p>To add a table to a note, right click and choose <em>Insert → Table</em>, or use the command palette.</p>
<p>Once you insert a table, you can add new columns and rows by clicking on the sides of the table. Add text with inline formatting. Press <code>tab</code> to navigate between cells.</p>
<h2>Improvements</h2>
<h3>Properties</h3>
<ul>
<li>Properties can now be renamed globally. Renaming will cause the property to be modified in each corresponding file and the search is case-insensitive.</li>
<li>Global Search: Search now works with non-string property values. Search for boolean values <code>[property:TRUE]</code> or <code>[property:FALSE]</code> or empty values <code>[property:EMPTY]</code>. You can also use inequality operators to search for things like <code>[some_property:&gt;10]</code>.</li>
<li>Global properties view can now be filtered.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Editing experience</h3>
<ul>
<li>New formatting menu. You can now right click in the editor to change text formatting, paragraph styles, and insert elements such as lists and tables.</li>
<li>Right-click on a callout to quickly change the callout type from a list of default callout type options.</li>
<li>Pressing <code>Tab</code> when the <code>#</code> autocomplete is active will autocomplete the highlighted suggestion. If the highlighted suggestion has a <code>/</code> in it, like "#projects/in-review", <code>Tab</code> will autocomplete by <em>segment</em>, so "#projects" then press again to get "/in-review".</li>
</ul>
<h3>Sync</h3>
<ul>
<li>When viewing the version history for a file, changes made by the same user on the same device will now be grouped together. And Markdown will be rendered to more closely match reading mode.</li>
<li>Number of vaults has increased from 5 to 10</li>
<li>Maximum file size has increased from 100MB to 200MB</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-help/assets/10565871/bf2334dd-6add-4dfa-9adb-67ff183746ec" alt="Sync version history"></p>
<h3>Quality of life</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Outline view now has a "collapse all" button as well as a search field for filtering the list of headings in the file.</li>
<li>Files from outside Obsidian can now be dropped anywhere in the File Explorer pane instead of on top of the vault name. Similarly, dropping a file on top of any item in a folder will cause the file to get imported into that particular folder.</li>
<li>Pressing <code>Ctrl/Command-F</code> in any view with a search input (including Backlinks or Properties) will now focus the search input.</li>
<li>Menu options within the <code>...</code> pane menu (the <code>...</code> in the tab header) as well as the tab menu (right clicking on a tab) have been cleaned up and should now show more relevant options.</li>
<li>Copy, cut, and paste items in the Bookmarks view (works via hotkey only currently).</li>
<li>Bookmarks: Removed the "Bookmark this block..." context menu item.</li>
<li>Added new "Show trash" command to open the .trash folder in filesystem.</li>
<li>The Appearance section in settings has been reordered for clarity.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Onboarding</h3>
<ul>
<li>Obsidian will now use the system setting for light or dark mode by default, you can change this in Appearance settings.</li>
<li>Improved the experience when creating a new vault from scratch. If you select "Create new vault," the created vault will include a <code>welcome.md</code> file and show a side-by-side view with the Graph view.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bug fixes</h3>
<ul>
<li>The active context menu is now automatically dismissed when the view navigates away or a modal appears.</li>
<li>Clicking 'New file' on an empty tab should open the new file in the current tab instead of creating a new one.</li>
<li>Properties: Fixed issue where properties view sometimes displayed a stale value when switching between files.</li>
<li>Properties: Fixed bug where pressing the left arrow key (<code>←</code>) the start the input would cause the input to blur.</li>
<li>Word count and character count status bar items now ignore frontmatter.</li>
<li>Bookmarks: Fixed several edge cases where drag and drop would fail to work, including dragging an item to the bottom of the bookmark list.</li>
<li>Fixed bug where canceling a drag would not cause the actively hovered element to remove its styling.</li>
<li>Unclosed <code>[[</code> will no longer cause the next line to get rendered as a link.</li>
<li>Updated "Auto pair brackets" behavior so that <code>[[link]]'s</code> can be typed without the apostrophe getting paired.</li>
<li>Hover preview is no longer positioned on top of the cursor or target element if there isn't enough room to display the preview box.</li>
<li>Editor selection is no longer blurred when resizing a tab group.</li>
<li>Search: Minor tweak to avoid the content shifting a lot as the search counter ticks upward.</li>
<li>Vim: Fixed issue with character movements not respective atomic ranges.</li>
<li>Vim: Fixed issue where <code>O</code> on the first line of a file with properties would put the cursor in the wrong position.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Developers</h2>
<ul>
<li>As of 1.5.0, the <a href="https://obsidian.md/blog/goodbye-legacy-editor/">Legacy editor has been completely removed</a> from Obsidian.</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.obsidian.md/Reference/CSS+variables/Editor/Table">New CSS table variables for selection and dragging</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Breaking changes</h2>
<ul>
<li>File Explorer and Tags pane both received a small code refactor. This might affect some plugins that rely on the internal JS structure. Themes should not be affected.</li>
<li>Tags can no longer end in a <code>/</code>.</li>
</ul>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>


<article>


<p>I wouldn't mind this <strong>huge</strong> ad so much if the pancake mix was made with lentil flour...on second thought, that doesn't sound good:</p>

<img src="https://www.openmymind.net/assets/forposts/website-catalogs/walmart-1.png" alt="walmart search result showing ads instead of results">

<p>And if I complain about not being able to sort by price/quality (or weight), I assume some people will point out that choice adds complexity. But it's hard to understand what value this choice is adding:</p>

<img src="https://www.openmymind.net/assets/forposts/website-catalogs/walmart-2.png" alt="facet with a single option">

<p>Since we're talking about facets, I'm curious what category those other 632 products fall under:</p>

<img src="https://www.openmymind.net/assets/forposts/website-catalogs/walmart-3.png" alt="category facets showing 16 total products despite having 648 results">

<p>At costco, a search for "rice" yields this amazing facet:</p>

<img src="https://www.openmymind.net/assets/forposts/website-catalogs/costco-1.png" alt="Each facet contains all the products">

<p>Surprise, the search returned 25 results (seriously).</p>

<p>I'm particularly intrigued by rice that isn't vegan, lactose free, or gluten free:</p>

<img src="https://www.openmymind.net/assets/forposts/website-catalogs/costco-2.png" alt="Rice facet showing only 1 vegan option">

<p>The sorting made me check wiki to see how much revenue they have ($242 billion):</p>

<img src="https://www.openmymind.net/assets/forposts/website-catalogs/costco-3.png" alt="Case-sensitive sorting of brands">

<p>There must be a term in information theory that describes what's going on here:</p>

<img src="https://www.openmymind.net/assets/forposts/website-catalogs/redmart-1.png" alt="Search for 'alcohol' returns non-alcohol results">

<p>You can't tell, but the 2nd result <em>is also</em> alcohol free (the first 10 results are). For any Singaporean thinking that Alibaba ruined Lazada who ruined Redmart: no.</p>

<p>I don't think anyone would be offended if I said e-commerce in the Philippines has a lot of catching up to do. But this first page search result is something else (yes, they sell a lot of other laundry detergent):</p>

<img src="https://www.openmymind.net/assets/forposts/website-catalogs/landers-1.png" alt="Search for 'laundry detergent' returns umbrellas">

<p>The inspiration for this post is that nintendo.com lets you filter for <code>2+</code> players, but that includes single system, local wireless and online. So there's no way to get a list of games that supports couch coop. Unless you want to check 1680 games that is:</p>

<img src="https://www.openmymind.net/assets/forposts/website-catalogs/nintendo-1.png" alt="1680 2+ player games">

<p>Haha, J/K. The search won't return more than 1000 records.</p>

<p>And while we're talking about nintendo.com, if you goto Games &gt; Nintendo Switch Games:</p>

<img src="https://www.openmymind.net/assets/forposts/website-catalogs/nintendo-2.png" alt="nintendo.com homepage top nav">

<p>You'll get 120 games and only 120 games. Of course the list of switch games isn't under Games &gt; Nintendo Switch Games that would be silly. But, for days I've tried and failed to figure out what these 120 games have in common and why they get this special treatment. I can't sleep.</p>

<p>A pretty major milestone has been achieved: Britain has become the first major country to halve its carbon emissions. The rapid pace of UK environmental progress means that our output is now below 319 million tonnes&nbsp;– half the 652 million tonnes at our 1970 peak. This is in spite of Britain now having a far larger population and economy than 50 years ago.</p>

<article>

<header>
  <p><time>25 December, 2023</time>
    
  </p>
</header>



<p>The Thanksgiving long weekend (23-26 November) in 2023 was an interesting one for OpenZFS, that I managed to land myself in the middle of. The short version of events is that an apparent silent data corruption bug was discovered, which is kind of the worst case scenario for a data storage system.</p>
<p>It was a pretty intense few days for me, initially one of a few people looking into the bug, and then later being involved in working out a fix, talking to downstream vendors, responding to private and public messages with users, my own customers and the press, and doing damage control. It was mostly done with by the end of the weekend, though took a couple of weeks to mop up, and overall I’d rate it a qualified success for the project.</p>
<p>I’ve been writing this post on and off since then. A lot happened, and I have a lot of thoughts, and I wanted to get them all down, but it got too much. So this post just covers the bug itself, and I’m hoping to write more about the fuzzier stuff soon. If you’re reading this months later and I still haven’t, maybe <a href="https://despairlabs.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#8fe7eae3e3e0cfebeafcffeee6fde3eeedfca1ece0e2">ping me</a> and remind me that I promised!</p>
<h2 id="free-filesystem-lesson">Free filesystem lesson</h2>
<p>To understand what happened, you need to know a little bit about OpenZFS internals. If you have been paying attention to <a href="https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/issues/15526">the whole kerfuffle</a>, then you might recognise some of the moving parts as we go along!</p>
<h3 id="what-is-a-file-really">What is a file, really?</h3>
<p>If you lift the lid on a OpenZFS filesystem (or volume!) you’ll find that OpenZFS is an object store. The top-level object is called an “object set” (or just “objset”), and can be thought of as just a giant array of objects. In turn, each object has two parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>the “dnode”, which is a kind of metadata header that describes the object’s type, size, etc, and carries a pointer to its first data block</li>
<li>the object data, which is a tree of blocks, either an “indirect” block that just points to more blocks, or a “data” block, which is, well, data.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the purposes of this discussion, we can consider a simplified view of the world, with the objset at the top, a list of dnodes, each with a count of attached data blocks, and then a list of data blocks.</p>



    <img src="https://despairlabs.com/blog/posts/2023-12-25-openzfs-data-corruption-bug/dnodes.png" alt="">
    


<p>There isn’t more to it in concept. Higher-level filesystem concepts are just built out of more objects, for example, a directory is just a special kind of object (internally called a “ZAP”) that is just a dictionary of name → object index.</p>
<h3 id="not-all-data-is-data">Not all data is data</h3>
<p>If a data block contains all zeroes, we can use a little optimisation. Instead of allocating real space on the disk just to store a whole bunch of zeroes, we can instead keep a note to say “this block is all zeroes”. We don’t have to store anything then, because we can recreate it on request. This note is called a “hole”, and is what gives a “sparse file” its “sparseness”.</p>
<p>So here are our files again, with some holes:</p>



    <img src="https://despairlabs.com/blog/posts/2023-12-25-openzfs-data-corruption-bug/holes.png" alt="">
    


<p>In every way, these look like they did before: the dnode still reports how many blocks they have. All that changes is that if something tries to read from one of the hole blocks, OpenZFS will create a data buffer as normal, but instead of actually going to disk and getting the data to put in the buffer, it will just zero the buffer. Less space required, fewer IO operations to spend. Lovely!</p>
<h3 id="the-fastest-disks-are-memory">The fastest disks are memory</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, disks are slow, even very fast ones. Memory, however, is very fast. So, when you make a change to a file, say, write some new data to the end of it, OpenZFS makes that change in memory only, and later writes it (and any other changes) down to disk. This is fast, because it only touches memory, and can make the later disk part even faster, eg your program may have written over part of a file, then written over the same part again, so when it comes to to write the change to disk, it only has to write the final state, not both changes.</p>
<p>Of course, keeping changes in memory means we need extra housekeeping information to know that we have changes to write out when the time comes. We call the changed things “dirty”, and to track this, we keep some lists.</p>
<p>The objset has a list of dirty dnodes, and each dnode has a list of dirty blocks. So after our write, we have some nice linked lists of dirty things, ready to be written out.</p>



    <img src="https://despairlabs.com/blog/posts/2023-12-25-openzfs-data-corruption-bug/dirty.png" alt="">
    


<p>There is one crucially important detail, of course: until that data is written to disk, the version in memory is the latest, and what the application believes exists (applications don’t really know a whole lot about this disk stuff). So anything inside OpenZFS that wants to consider the current state of an object has to look at the dirty information as well, to know if its looking at the latest or not.</p>
<h3 id="data-first">Data first</h3>
<p>When it comes time to write everything out, first the blocks are written:</p>



    <img src="https://despairlabs.com/blog/posts/2023-12-25-openzfs-data-corruption-bug/data-written.png" alt="">
    


<p>And then the dnodes go out, and everything is on disk.</p>



    <img src="https://despairlabs.com/blog/posts/2023-12-25-openzfs-data-corruption-bug/dnode-written.png" alt="">
    


<p>I’ve of course left out a million tiny details, not least of which is the whole copy-on-write thing. This is a useful conceptual model though; in this part of the code you can largely take for granted that the layers below you will take care of all that.</p>
<h2 id="beware-of-holes">Beware of holes</h2>
<p>The crux of this bug is around hole detection.</p>
<p>Sometimes an application wants to know where the holes in a file are. A file copying program is a good example: its whole job is to read all the data from one file, and write it to another. If it can find out that there’s a hole, then it saves itself the trouble of reading that block, and it also tell the filesystem to make a hole in the copy too. Even less space and fewer IO operations to think about. Extra lovely!</p>
<p>For a program to find out about holes, it can call <a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/lseek.2.html"><code>lseek()</code></a> with the <code>SEEK_HOLE</code> or <code>SEEK_DATA</code> options, which say “tell me the position of the next hole” or “next data”.</p>
<p>Holes are actually stored on disk in OpenZFS as a zero-length block pointer. There’s also a clever optimisation, which is that if a program writes a full list of zeroes, the compression system will notice and “compress” it down to a hole. However, block pointers and compression belong to the IO layer, which is quite a way away from the object layer (the DMU).</p>
<p>As a result, there’s no way currently to discover if a dirty block will eventually be stored as a hole. For this reason, <code>lseek()</code> checks if the dnode is dirty, and if so, it waits for it to be written out before it goes looking for holes.</p>
<h3 id="hidden-dirt">Hidden dirt</h3>
<p>So now we come to the actual bug: the dirty check. Recall how we track dirty things:</p>



    <img src="https://despairlabs.com/blog/posts/2023-12-25-openzfs-data-corruption-bug/dirty.png" alt="">
    


<p>Before <a href="https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/pull/15571">we fixed it</a>, the dirty check for <code>lseek()</code> used to be “is this dnode on the dirty list?”. Note that this is a subtly different question from what we actually want to know, which is “is this dnode dirty?”.</p>
<p>And there’s the bug. There is a moment in the dnode write process where the dnode is taken off the “dirty” list, and put on the “synced” list. This happens before the data blocks are written out, so there is a moment where the dnode looks like this:</p>



    <img src="https://despairlabs.com/blog/posts/2023-12-25-openzfs-data-corruption-bug/dirty-gap.png" alt="">
    


<p>This gap is <em>tiny</em>. Hard to estimate, but we’re talking tens of CPU instructions. But if <code>lseek()</code> comes along in that moment, the dirty check fails, so it goes into the “search for data/holes” stage. And because that only sees fully allocated and written blocks, it actually sees something more like this:</p>



    <img src="https://despairlabs.com/blog/posts/2023-12-25-openzfs-data-corruption-bug/not-clean.png" alt="">
    


<p>And so, if a program asks about holes, it may well end up wrongly finding them in the last couple of blocks of the file.</p>
<h3 id="the-idea-of-data">The idea of data</h3>
<p>Of course, the data is there, and if the program had only read it, it would have found this, but OpenZFS gave it reason to believe that it wasn’t there, so it didn’t bother.</p>
<p>This whole madness started because <a href="https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/issues/15526#issuecomment-1823575126">someone posted an attempt at a test case</a> for a different issue, and then that <a href="https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/issues/15526#issuecomment-1823633960">test case started failing</a> on versions of OpenZFS that didn’t even have the feature in question. The key part of that test was that it used the <code>/bin/cp</code> program from <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/coreutils.html">GNU Coreutils</a>, which is almost ubiquitous on Linux systems. In v9.2 it started using <code>lseek()</code> to discover holes in source files.</p>
<p>When a new file is created, it starts life as:</p>



    <img src="https://despairlabs.com/blog/posts/2023-12-25-openzfs-data-corruption-bug/new-file.png" alt="">
    


<p>That is, just the metadata, no data.</p>
<p>When we add some data, it becomes:</p>



    <img src="https://despairlabs.com/blog/posts/2023-12-25-openzfs-data-corruption-bug/new-dirty.png" alt="">
    


<p>If we manage to catch it just right though, it looks like:</p>



    <img src="https://despairlabs.com/blog/posts/2023-12-25-openzfs-data-corruption-bug/new-hole.png" alt="">
    


<p><code>cp</code>’s opening move is <code>lseek(…, 0, SEEK_DATA)</code>, which is to say, “find the first data item from position 0”. When it works, it returns <code>0</code>, because that’s where the data is. If it fails, it sets error <code>ENXIO</code>, that is: no data here. So <code>cp</code> doesn’t read, and it writes zeroes (or a hole!) to the output.</p>
<p>Incidentally, that’s why this isn’t “corruption” in the traditional sense (and why a scrub doesn’t find it): no data was lost. <code>cp</code> didn’t read data that was there, and it wrote some zeroes which OpenZFS safely stored.</p>
<h2 id="the-long-way-home">The long way home</h2>
<p>In the course of exploring the problem, we found that setting the config parameter <code>zfs_dmu_offset_next_sync=0</code> defanged the reproducer. This quickly became the recommended workaround. It also brought some confusion of its own, as it appeared to improve performance, leading some to wonder if they should just leave it off permanently. It also turns out that it doesn’t actually stop the bug from occurring, just makes it vastly more difficult to hit. All this has been extremely difficult to explain, which naturally means I should expect success if I have one more go at it.</p>
<h3 id="transaction-pipeline">Transaction pipeline</h3>
<p>To understand this part we need to know a little about the transaction pipeline.</p>
<p>At any point in time, OpenZFS has three transactions in flight.</p>
<ul>
<li>The OPEN transaction, which receives new changes as they arrive.</li>
<li>The QUIESCING transaction, where the changes are combined and prepared to be written to disk.</li>
<li>The SYNCING transaction, which is being written out to disk right now.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the SYNCING transaction is written, everything is moved along. QUIESCING becomes the new SYNCING, OPEN moves to QUIESCING, and a new OPEN transaction is created. There’s more details of course, but this is the basic idea.</p>
<p>Changes are only added to the OPEN transaction. Once it moves to the next state, it can’t be modified again. So a busy object can end up with changes on multiple transactions. And this means that when we ask “is this object dirty?”, what we’re actually asking is “is this object dirty on transaction N?” or “is this object dirty on any transaction?”</p>
<h3 id="diary-of-a-change">Diary of a change</h3>
<p>Here’s a visual representation of how changes flow through the transaction pipeline. This is conceptual, of course - “clean” objects are not on any transaction, but then again, “transactions” are not a real thing either.</p>
<p>So lets imagine a nice normal clean object, on the current transaction.</p>



    <img src="https://despairlabs.com/blog/posts/2023-12-25-openzfs-data-corruption-bug/txg0.png" alt="">
    


<p>We append a block to it, which makes it dirty in memory in memory on the current transaction.</p>



    <img src="https://despairlabs.com/blog/posts/2023-12-25-openzfs-data-corruption-bug/txg1.png" alt="">
    


<p>On the next transaction, we append another block to it. Yellow here shows the changes that aren’t on disk yet but are considered “unchanged” on this transaction.</p>



    <img src="https://despairlabs.com/blog/posts/2023-12-25-openzfs-data-corruption-bug/txg2.png" alt="">
    


<p>This time we don’t make any modifications, so this object is “clean” on the OPEN transaction. The first change we made is now on the SYNCING transaction, and starts getting written out.</p>



    <img src="https://despairlabs.com/blog/posts/2023-12-25-openzfs-data-corruption-bug/txg3.png" alt="">
    


<p>The transactions move along again and the second change starts getting written out.</p>



    <img src="https://despairlabs.com/blog/posts/2023-12-25-openzfs-data-corruption-bug/txg4.png" alt="">
    


<p>All changes are are now written.</p>



    <img src="https://despairlabs.com/blog/posts/2023-12-25-openzfs-data-corruption-bug/txg5.png" alt="">
    


<h3 id="everywhere-is-dirty">Everywhere is dirty</h3>
<p>Earlier I wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The objset has a list of dirty dnodes, and each dnode has a list of dirty blocks. So after our write, we have some nice linked lists of dirty things, ready to be written out.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But with multiple transactions in flight, we actually need a dirty dnode list and a dirty block list for each transaction, which means things actually look more like this:</p>



    <img src="https://despairlabs.com/blog/posts/2023-12-25-openzfs-data-corruption-bug/dnode-lists.png" alt="">
    


<p>This of course means the dirty check is more complex too. I wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a result, there’s no way currently to discover if a dirty block will eventually be stored as a hole. For this reason, <code>lseek()</code> checks if the dnode is dirty, and if so, it waits for it to be written out before it goes looking for holes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The user’s view of the object (via system calls like <code>lseek()</code> is whatever is on the OPEN transaction. Because looking for holes means looking at the on-disk state, that means we have to wait until <em>all</em> pending changes are on disk. So our dirty check here has to be “is this object dirty on any transaction?”, which means checking if the dnode is on <em>any</em> dirty list.</p>
<h3 id="wait-for-service">Wait for service</h3>
<p>Recall that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>lseek()</code> checks if the dnode is dirty, and if so, it waits for it to be written out before it goes looking for holes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even if the object is dirty only on a single transaction, that wait can be long if the pool is very busy. So OpenZFS has a config option, <code>dmu_offset_next_sync</code> which controls what the <code>dmu_offset_next()</code> function (one of the work functions implementing <code>lseek()</code>) does when the dnode is dirty.</p>
<p>If set to <code>0</code>, and the object is dirty, then instead of waiting, the function simply returns an error, which causes <code>lseek()</code>  to return “data here”. This is allowed; its always safe to say there’s data where there’s a hole, because reading a hole area will always find “zeroes”, which is valid data. It can mean a loss of efficiency, because the application can’t do special things for holes, but at least the data is always intact. And because its a simple dirty check, its fast.</p>
<p>If its set to <code>1</code> (the default), it will wait instead. Specifically, it will do a dirty check, and if its dirty, it will wait until the currently-syncing transaction is written out. Then it will do another dirty check; if the object is still dirty, it will return an error (and so <code>lseek()</code> returns “data here”), and if clean, it will go into hole detection as normal.</p>
<p>So now we understand the apparent performance gain with <code>dmu_offset_next_sync=0</code> (it just never waits). But why does that also appear to mitigate the bug?</p>
<h3 id="doubly-dirty">Doubly dirty</h3>
<p>Recall that the bug occurs in the moment where the dnode is taken off the dirty list, but not yet put on the syncing list, and in that moment its not a list, so its erroneously considered to be clean.</p>
<p>Since there’s actually multiple lists, but this gap only occurs on the SYNCING list, it gives some idea of where the window you have to hit is. Its not a change “just made”, but actually made two transactions ago (from the perspective of the user). On a quiet system that can be whole seconds ago. On a busy object, with changes on multiple in-flight transactions, a single dirty check (ie <code>dmu_offset_next_sync=0</code>) is always going to result in “dirty”, and so <code>lseek()</code> returning “data here”, because even if there’s a gap on the SYNCING list, the dnode will also be on the OPEN or QUIESCING dirty lists, and so still be dirty. So the only time we can hit a gap is for the “some time later” case. Not out of the question, but incredibly difficult for any non-contrived workload (or even contrived - to my knowledge its <a href="https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/issues/15526#issuecomment-1826104073">only been seen on a quite large and unusual ARM64 system</a>, and even then its hard to hit).</p>
<p>In the “wait for sync” mode (<code>dmu_offset_next_sync=1</code>), we have two dirty checks, and either of them can go wrong. For the first check to fail its the same as above, the “some time later” case. Its the second that is more interesting, with a wait in between.</p>
<p>To get the wrong answer, the dnode must only be on the SYNCING list, so that when its removed, its not on any other lists. The two dirty checks are one transaction apart, so for the second to <em>incorrectly</em> return “clean”, the dnode must be dirty on two consecutive transactions. That’s not hard to arrange of course, but that alone isn’t really going to make much difference.</p>
<p>The difference is just the timing. The first (or only) dirty check can happen any time; whenever <code>lseek()</code> is called. The second however is always called just the after the transaction has synced and the next one is beginning sync. The object in question is dirty there, and is removed from the dirty list and added to the syncing list before it starts syncing, which means there’s a better-than-usual chance that its happening just as <code>dmu_offset_next()</code> loops and does the dirty check. Overall, it raises the chances of hitting the gap and getting the wrong answer.</p>
<h2 id="a-clone-in-time">A clone in time</h2>
<p>The original bug appeared to point to block cloning as being the cause of the problem, and it was treated as such until the problem was reproduced on an earlier version of OpenZFS without block cloning. This didn’t end up being the case, and it initially being blamed is perhaps a symptom of a deeper problem, but that’s for another post.</p>
<p>However some people did report that disabling block cloning entirely appeared to helped. So far we haven’t really found any reason why it would make a difference, other than at a distance by changing the timing - its faster to apply a clone than a write, because there’s no actual data to copy or write, so that allows more dirty dnodes and/or more transactions to be processed in a shorter amount of time. This alone means nothing, as the gap is still the same amount of time, but with other variables like hardware and workload, it could change it in the right way.</p>
<p>Another reason cloning was implicated was that the bug had been seen on FreeBSD. Its <code>/bin/cp</code> is not the Coreutils one, and doesn’t look for holes, but does call <code>copy_file_range()</code>, which hands off copying to the kernel to do the copy however it would like. This function has become known as “the cloning function” because the kernel might choose to service the copy via clones. However on FreeBSD it will also use <code>lseek()</code> under the hood to try to replicate holes in the file, and so can run into the same problem. <code>copy_file_range()</code> on Linux doesn’t do this, and that’s most peoples experience of cloning, leading to confusion.</p>
<p>That’s not to say there isn’t problems with block cloning at all - there’s a few known, which is why its currently disabled by default in OpenZFS releases. The upcoming 2.2.3 release will fix some significant issues with block cloning, and a comprehensive test suite is coming together. How block cloning became the whole thing it is, and the interaction with this and other issues in the public perception, is something I want to write more about, but this has gone on long enough.</p>
<h2 id="history-of-a-bug">History of a bug</h2>
<p>This bug has a long history, as can be seen by reading multiple earlier patches that made changes around it. All had seen <em>something</em> wrong, but hadn’t fully understood it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Nov 2021: <a href="https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/commit/de198f2d9507b6dcf3d0d8f037ba33940208733e"><code>de198f2</code></a> Fix lseek(SEEK_DATA/SEEK_HOLE) mmap consistency</li>

</ul>
<p>The proto-bug seems to go back even further, to <a href="https://github.com/illumos/illumos-gate/commit/c543ec060d#diff-9a7602b987a5c727d34def47076cc6fce32bdd5bdb114eb3c05c413595cc6116L1641">a 2006 commit</a> in early Sun ZFS. Among other changes, we see:</p>

That alone is not a bug; it might be that there’s something else preventing the off-list gap being hit (eg another lock), so maybe the bug was never in this version of ZFS. What has changed is that its no longer possible to understand the dirty state directly; its now reliant on what’s happening elsewhere in the system.</p>
<p>I’m not really blaming anyone - complex problems sometimes require complex solutions! Its just one of those things that the details of are long forgotten, so its on the reader to make sure they understand it, without much external guidance. There’s more to say about this, but not here.</p>
<h2 id="turn-tape-over">Turn tape over</h2>
<p>In the end its not a data corruption bug <em>as such</em>, but possibly that’s splitting hairs. As you see though, it has existed a long long time, and is fiendishly difficult to hit in almost all real-world scenarios, and even harder to hit <em>undetected</em>. It does reinforce the standard mantras about storage though: take backups, test your backups.</p>
<p>I’ll never exactly be happy about a data-loss bug, but what I am happy about is the way that a whole group of people appeared over a holiday weekend and worked together to solve an ancient mystery. I loved being a part of it, and I’m now looking for ways to get that happening in more proactive and less desperate situations.</p>
<p>That’s all for now. Hopefully more soon about all the other thoughts I had while working on this!</p>

Not a core dev was merging, not even Guido;<br>
The CI was spun on the PRs with care<br>
In hopes that green check-markings soon would be there;<br>
The buildbots were nestled all snug under desks,<br>
Even PPC64 AIX;<br>
Doc-writers, triage team, the Council of Steering,<br>
Had just stashed every change and stopped engineering,</p>
<p dir="auto">When in the "PRs" tab arose such a clatter,<br>
They opened GitHub to see what was the matter.<br>
Away to CPython they flew like a flash,<br>
Towards sounds of <code>PROT_EXEC</code> and <code>__builtin___clear_cache</code>.<br>
First <a href="https://github.com/brandtbucher/cpython/blob/justin/Tools/jit/README.md">LLVM was downloaded, unzipped</a><br>
Then the Actions were running <a href="https://github.com/brandtbucher/cpython/blob/justin/Tools/jit/build.py">a strange new build script</a>,<br>

            <p><b>Posted by</b> Rampant Coyote on August 12, 2014</p>
            
                        
<p><em>One of my most popular posts was also my very first… which has since been lost to the Great Blog Devouring of ’14. So…&nbsp; here’s the post from over ten years ago (has it been that long?!?!?!) about an event from almost twenty years ago. Still stuff I have to remind myself about some days.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://rampantgames.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/warhawk_1.jpg"><img decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" src="http://rampantgames.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/warhawk_1-300x225.jpg" alt="warhawk_1" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://rampantgames.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/warhawk_1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://rampantgames.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/warhawk_1.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a>In October of 1994, I’d just started as an honest-to-goodness videogame programmer at a small startup called SingleTrac which later went on to fame and glory (but unfortunately not much in the way of fortune) with such titles as <strong>Warhawk</strong>, the <strong>Twisted Metal</strong> series, and the <strong>Jet Moto</strong> series. But at the time, the company was less than 20 employees in size and had only been officially in business for about a month. It was sometime in my first week possibly my first or second day. In the main engineering room, there was a whoop and cry of success.</p>
<p>Our company financial controller and acting HR lady, Jen, came in to see what incredible things the engineers and artists had come up with. Everyone was staring at a television set hooked up to a development box for the Sony Playstation. There, on the screen, against a single-color background, was a black triangle.</p>
<p>“It’s a black triangle,” she said in an amused but sarcastic voice. One of the engine programmers tried to explain, but she shook her head and went back to her office. I could almost hear her thoughts… “We’ve got ten months to deliver two games to Sony, and they are cheering over a black triangle? <em>THAT</em> took them nearly a month to develop?”</p>
<p>What she later came to realize (and explain to others) was that the black triangle was a pioneer. It wasn’t just that we’d managed to get a triangle onto the screen. That could be done in about a day. It was the journey the triangle had taken to get up on the screen. It had passed through our new modeling tools, through two different intermediate converter programs, had been loaded up as a complete database, and been rendered through a fairly complex scene hierarchy, fully textured and lit (though there were no lights, so the triangle came out looking black). The black triangle demonstrated that the foundation was finally complete the core of a fairly complex system was completed, and we were now ready to put it to work doing cool stuff. By the end of the day, we had complete models on the screen, manipulating them with the controllers. Within a week, we had an environment to move the model through.</p>
<p>Afterwards, we came to refer to certain types of accomplishments as “black triangles.” These are important accomplishments that take a lot of effort to achieve, but upon completion you don’t have much to show for it only that more work can now proceed. It takes someone who really knows the guts of what you are doing to appreciate a black triangle.</p>
<p>Years later,&nbsp;I was chatting with another SingleTrac alumnus, and was excitedly relating my work on the multiplayer code. I’d spent a little over a week working on the underlying architecture, trying to make it clean and reliable and easy to use. It was all UDP rather than TCP/IP (for speed), so I created my own “guaranteed delivery” protocol for those rare packets that needed to be guaranteed. I’d rarely worked low-level network code before, so it was kind of a new experience. When all was said and done, I had another computer join the game and boom! There it was, on the host machine. Wow. No updates, it did next to nothing, but the core architecture was there. The rest SHOULD come together quickly. Explaining this to my buddy over IM, I explained, “It’s a black triangle.” He understood what I meant immediately. It’s a convenient shorthand metaphor.</p>
<p>So feel free to steal the term. And when progress seems a little slow because you are doing a bunch of hardcore architecture work, just remember it’s a black triangle.</p>

<p>So here’s a program written in a hurry, possibly in the style of a college CS student in about week six of learning C++ as a taught course. It’s simple, it works, and it can (naturally) be improved upon:</p>

<p>Not all choices can be made at compile-time, sometimes including which function (of several possibilities) to invoke. This article aims to cover all of the methods available to Modern C++ when selecting which function to call, with the decision made at runtime (based upon user input, for example). Terms covered in this article include function pointers, function objects, virtual functions and lambdas.</p>

<p>In this article we’re going to look at a feature new to C++23 which supports a way to return an error condition from a function where a result value was anticipated. This is enabled in a new header <code>&lt;expected&gt;</code> which (as far as I am aware) does not require specific compiler support. (MSVC 19.37 with <code>/std:c++latest</code> was used to test the program code in this article.)</p>

<p>When writing C++, we like to do as much of the work as possible at compile time; with C++ being a statically-typed language, we know the type(s) involved when compilation is taking place. In this article we’ll look at how to pass and receive, variables and results, of differing types depending on the nature of the function call itself. The four methods we will examine are: function overloading, template specialization, tag dispatch, and SFINAE.</p>

<p>Concepts finally appeared in the language with the completion of C++20—I say finally as work to specify them had been going on continuously since before the release of C++11. This article attempts to explain their rationale and usage, with examples that should compile on any up-to-date C++ compiler when specifying <code>-std=c++20</code> (or <code>/std:c++20</code> for MSVC).</p>



<p>So why do we need concepts when template syntax has been available since C++98? Put simply, templates have been (successfully) used in ways that were never envisaged; however the reporting of invalid instantiations and similar errors has not kept pace. Also, the use of <code>auto</code> in function parameter lists gives us template syntax “invisibly”, which the novice/intermediate coder may not expect.</p>

<p>Traits and policy classes are often used with C++ generics, but their role and purpose is often something of an enigma even to experienced C++ programmers. The definitions of these two terms overlap to some extent, and could be summarized as follows:</p>



<ul>
<li>Traits represent natural additional properties of a template parameter.</li>



<li>Policies represent configurable behavior for generic functions and types.</li>
</ul>



<p>In this article the example code will show use of both of these two, with type information obtained through a (specialized) traits class and functionality obtained from a (generic) policy class.</p>

<p>Functional programming (FP) is a discipline and practice of computer science where Mathematical concepts come to the fore. There are a number of popular FP languages out there, but we can stay with C++ and explore some of the themes of FP by using a subset of familiar syntax. In this article we’ll look at a number of FP concepts, such as purity, immutability and use of higher-order functions, and how they can be concisely and usefully represented in Modern C++.</p>



<h3>1. Purity</h3>



<p>A function is considered pure if its operation depends only upon its formal input parameters, that is not accessing any external (global) state. Global state in FP is a little like the historical Goto statement, shunned but sometimes necessary, and so is by design abstracted away as much as possible. A C++ lambda is pure if it has an empty capture clause, for example:</p>

<p>In the previous articles of this mini-series we’ve covered the use of custom serialization and deserialization functions to generate and interpret XML. In this article we’ll look at how to add to existing classes to give them the ability to utilize the (de-)serialization logic already written. The process is similar to before: create an in-memory model and then serialize it, or start with blank containers and then read in the data, checking for errors.</p>

<p>In the previous articles we’ve looked at creating an in-memory XML hierarchy (or DOM), and serializing from and deserializing to this memory model. In this article we’re going to look at querying the DOM in a similar fashion to JavaScript methods such as <code>document.getElementById()</code> available in a browser. The scheme chosen is to overload <code>operator []</code> (twice) and provide other convenience methods such as <code>name()</code> and <code>numberOfChildren()</code>.</p>

<p>The complement of serialization is deserialization, and this is typically more difficult as it requires character- or pattern-matching of the input, plus checking for erroneous input. To match a stream of XML the possibility of using <code>std::getline()</code> was considered, but this is too inflexible as regards whitespace. Stream input to a <code>std::string</code> was also considered, but again this is unsuitable as breaking all input at whitespace is not what is needed.</p>

<p>Data held in memory must be saved to a store in order to outlive the running-time of the program it belongs to. Simply dumping binary data to disk is not usually the best way, or even a practicable way, of achieving this (think security issues, endianness, 32-bits/64-bits etc.)</p>



<p>The terms “serialization” and its companion “deserialization” are used to describe the conversion between the in-memory model and a (usually textual) disk-file representation. As an example, consider a web-browser which reads an HTML web page (and its dependencies) from a network connection and converts (deserializes) it into a format which can be manipulated through the DOM (Document Object Model). In this article we’ll concentrate more on serialization, which is often a simpler task.</p>

<p>Learning a new programming language is hard, and is especially daunting when as a novice programmer the compiler rejects pretty much every program you write the first time you try to compile it. Of course, compiler errors and warnings are important as they encourage you to write correct code and ensure that your program actually runs at all, and works as expected.</p>



<p>C++ has traditionally been seen as one of the harder programming languages for beginners to pick up; ideally you should already  have some coding experience under your belt in (an)other programming language(s) before trying to learn Modern C++. This mini-series intends to examine the parts of C++ that novice (and more experienced) programmers sometimes fail to understand fully, leading to buggy and/or sub-optimal code.</p>

<p>In this article we’re going to continue the theme of a class-designer’s toolkit, looking at adding generics (template functionality) to C++ classes. Templates have been around since C++98, and almost all C++ programmers will have used them: <code>std::vector&lt;int&gt;</code> has the type <code>int</code>  as a parameter, itself being a specialization of a generic class. Any user-defined type can be used as a type parameter, having equal status to the built-in types.</p>



<h3>Generic classes</h3>



<p>Classes which are preceded by a the <code>template</code> keyword are automatically turned into generic classes. These classes can have any number of template parameters, we’re going to concentrate on classes having just one, this being a template type parameter. The class definition starts of as follows:</p>

<b> Explanation: </b> 
Single shots like this require planning. 

The first step is to realize that such an amazing 
<a href="https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap150624.html">triple-alignment</a> actually takes place.

The second step is to find the best location to photograph it.

But it was the third step: being there at exactly the right time -- 
and when the sky was clear -- that was the hardest.

Five times over six years the photographer tried and found 
<a href="https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210613.html">bad weather</a>. 

Finally, just ten days ago, the 
<a href="https://climatekids.nasa.gov/menu/weather-and-climate/">weather</a> 
was perfect, and a photographic dream was realized.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
  

  
  <p>written on Monday, December 25, 2023
  

  </p><p>You likely know that I've contributed <a href="https://lucumr.pocoo.org/projects">significantly to the Open Source community</a>, that I work <a href="https://sentry.io/welcome/">for an Open Source Company</a>, that we got <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36971490">shit for calling ourselves
Open Source</a> and that we
subsequently created <a href="https://fsl.software/">a new license</a> to address
at least some of these concerns.  I also shared <a href="https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2023/11/19/cathedral-and-bazaaar-licensing/">my personal thoughts</a> on that license recently
which unfortunately promptly <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38331173">attracted a bunch more negative comments</a> for that.  That
introduction might make me sound a tad bitter, so let's talk about
something else.</p>
<p>This Christmas I <a href="https://twitter.com/mitsuhiko/status/1738930820998369593">received a 3D printer</a> and I love
it for two reasons.  Firstly, it was an unexpected gift from my wonderful
wife, who chose it.  She organized me a brand new <a href="https://bambulab.com/en/a1">Bambu Lab A1</a> 3D printer.  It has been a few years since
I toyed around with 3D printing and it was mostly in the context of other
people assembling printers.  That's because even though I love toying
around with software, I cannot say the same for hardware.  This printer,
however, is remarkably easy to set up and use, significantly boosting my
enjoyment in this hobby.  For this purchase she had to balance my love for
Open Source with user friendly technology and I think given the good
experience, she chose well.</p>
<p>The printer comes with a brief guide for the initial setup.  In about 15
minutes of removing some screws and mounting some components we were off
to the races.  The cloud account appears optional but after scanning a QR
code I could operate it from my phone too.  It's quick, it's super plug and
play and it just feels like an incredibly well put together product.</p>
<p>Since I've had to leave the printer at home over the holidays, I've been
engaging in related activities like reading up, creating models, and
exploring the slicer software.  Emotions surrounding this printer are
<em>charged</em>.  If you step into the wrong parts of the internet you find a
lot of hate.  Some of it might be warranted, but others just feels
incredibly out of proportion.  I've noticed a fair amount of controversy
surrounding the printer online, largely centered on its Chinese origins,
its optional cloud service, and its impact on the Open Source 3D printing
community.  I won't talk much about the China part <a href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-reference-1">[1]</a> here, but I do
want to talk about the cloud and license aspect.</p>
<p>The reason I even write about this printer is the licensing situation and
a bit of a rant about Open Source communities.  Here is what I believe is
currently happening, and I'm saying this as a person that knew next to
nothing until a few days ago about 3D printing: Bambu Labs is making some
other players in that space reconsider Open Source.</p>
<p>Bambu entered the industry in a very different way than anyone else
before.  They offer a user friendly experience at a very attractive price
point (lower than some of the competition).  They also added built-in
cloud service stuff and with a really good quality.  But it's a space
dominated by Open Source hardware and software.  And they don't really do
that.  Bambu seems to add new people into the 3D printing community who
don't don't care (or not as much) about Open Source.  Yet Bambu heavily
relied on Open Source software to put them on the map.</p>
<p>If you open their Bambu Studio, you can see that it's built on top of
<a href="https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer">PrusaSlicer</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/supermerill/SuperSlicer">SuperSlicer</a>, both of
which are Open Source.  As both of those are licensed under AGPL (which is
a very viral license), <a href="https://github.com/bambulab/BambuStudio">so is Bambu Studio</a>.  But none of the firmware or
hardware designs of the Bambu printer are.  In fact, Bambu apparently is
also loading itself up with patents over in China, so they probably don't
care about Open Source much at all.  If I were Prusa (which in many ways
was the user friendly, dominant player before) I wouldn't be very happy.</p>
<p>So let's discuss Prusa: The Bambu A1 competes with Prusa's MK4 model
but is signficantly cheaper, faster and does more.  For the price of one
Prusa MK4 with shipping I could buy three Bambu A1 printers or two Bambu
A2 printers plus the AMS addon which adds multi-color printing.  There is
absolutely no reason to buy a Prusa MK4 today unless you want to support
Open Source or a European company (Prusa is from Czechia).</p>
<p>I was able tell that Prusa is reconsidering their Open Source approach and
that with a few days as a member of this community because people are
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/prusa3d/comments/10g6fgv/prusa_giving_up_on_its_open_source_roots/">complaining</a>
(The MK4 firmware is not Open Source).  Prusa is not hiding that they are
reconsidering their ways thanks to a blog post by their founder about how
they are <a href="https://blog.prusa3d.com/the-state-of-open-source-in-3d-printing-in-2023_76659/">reconsidering their Open Source ways</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[…] things we’ve been doing at Prusa Research for over ten years were
only possible thanks to the great <strong>3D printing community</strong> and
<strong>open-source philosophy</strong>. However, the new printers and software
releases have made me think again about the current state of open
source in the 3D printing world. How sustainable it is, how our
competitors deal with it, what it brings to the community, and what
troubles us as developers.  Consider this article as a <strong>call for
discussion</strong> – as a kick-off that will (hopefully) open up a new
perspective on the connection between open-source licensing, consumer
hardware, and software development.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>The open-source movement relies on the fact that <strong>everyone involved
plays by the same rules</strong>.</p>
<p>—Josef Průša in <a href="https://blog.prusa3d.com/the-state-of-open-source-in-3d-printing-in-2023_76659/">The state of open-source in 3D printing in 2023</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I strongly recommend reading that entire post, because it captures quite
well the challenging situation that Open Source companies are in.  My take
on this is very much the same as for our own situation at Sentry: building
a true Open Source company is hard.  Under the OSI definition of Open
Source you are put at a massive disadvantage as you are prevented from
putting protections in place that shield you from other competitors in
that place that chose not to play by the same rules but can leverage your
source.</p>
<p>Historically the GPL has provided some protections here, but in all
reality in the modern world it doesn't.  That's because distribution is
really no longer the defining element.  Yes, Bambu Studio has to be AGPL
licensed because so is what it's built on, but in many ways that's just the
enabler for a proprietary system that they have in place.  They have
reaped years of benefits from this, benefiting from the work of others.
Some paid, but also from many who contributed for free.</p>
<p>Here is what I think would be a negative outcome: if this situation forces
companies like Prusa to abandon their Open Source practices.</p>
<p>However, I believe this situation reaffirms my belief that licenses like
our <a href="https://fsl.software/">FSL</a> (TL;DR: it includes a two-year
commercial non-compete period, after which it transitions to either MIT or
Apache 2, depending on the choice) are a viable alternative, even though
they are not considered Open Source by today's definition.  Because one
thing is absolutely clear to me: Bambu carries inherent risk for me as a
user.  They manufacture the parts and provide the firmware.</p>
<p>If they go out of business, owning their device becomes much riskier than
owning printers from the Open Source community.  For an end-user, having an
Open Source license is a far stronger proposition.  That's why I find the
comparison of the FSL to a “source available” or even “proprietary”
license somewhat insulting. A hypothetical FSL-inspired license for Open
Source hardware would grant a hardware company a limited-time non-compete
advantage over other players in the space, while giving users and the
community the assurance that they hold the keys after two years.</p>
<p>The world around us is changing, and so must we as the Open Source
community.  Software distribution is no longer the main focus, with much
emphasis now on services.  The situation also changes for successful Open
Source hardware communities.  Their innovations are slowly reaching more
users, many of whom do not value Open Source as much. In some ways, the
protections in Open Source that worked in a commercial context are no
longer effective.</p>
<p>What Bambu has done — and which I believe will be appreciated in the long
term — is to make their products more accessible to a broader audience.  They
introduced 3D printing to people who were previously unwilling to invest
the time.  This means there's more potential for profit for everyone
involved, but it also means that it will be harder for Open Source to
compete, especially if Open Source entities don't get a grip of their user
experience and business models.  As a user, I wish I could have the Bambu
experience with an Open Source-like model, where the risk is managed over
the long term, while allowing the companies that create these products to
pay their employees and continue innovating.</p>

I collected some of the suggested projects and put them in a list at the end of this post.</i></p>

<p>I talk to a lot of students and professional developers that often want to start a side project, but aren't sure what to build. Below is a handful of software projects that taught me a lot. In fact, they're great because you could build them multiple times and learn new things each time. So whenever I don't know what to build or I want to learn a new programming language or framework, I start with one of these:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Text editor</li>
    <li>2D game - Space Invaders</li>
    <li>Compiler - Tiny BASIC</li>
    <li>Mini operating system</li>
    <li>Spreadsheet <small>(<i>hard!</i>)</small></li>
    <li>Video game console emulator <small>(<i>hard!</i>)</small></li>
</ul>


<br><h3>Text Editor</h3>

<p>We use text editors everyday, but do you know how it really works? Ignoring all of the fancy features that your favorite editor has, how would you implement a textbox that supports a movable text cursor and selecting, inserting, and deleting text? No, you can't use the builtin textbox component from your favorite GUI framework!</p>

<p>The biggest challenge is figuring out how to store the text document in memory. My first thought was to use an array, but that has horrible performance if the user inserts text anywhere other than the end of the document. Luckily, there are some nice data structures to learn to solve this.</p>

<p>Another hurdle was learning how a text cursor behaves in popular editors. For example, if I press the up arrow key with the cursor in the middle of the document, where will the cursor move? Same column? Not if that line is shorter. Keep pressing up. The cursor will snap back to the original column once a line is long enough. It turns out that the cursor has a memory for the column and tries to get back to it. It is these details that I never noticed until I tried to implement it.</p>

<img src="https://austinhenley.com/blog/images/textcursor.gif">

<p>After implementing the basic editor, I challenge you to implement two more features: undo/redo and word wrapping. Implementing undo/redo in an efficient way was mind blowing to me! I first tried keeping an array of previous states, then tried the Memento pattern, before finally settling on the Command pattern. Word wrapping forces you to separate the <i>visual</i> aspects of a text line from the memory aspects.</p>


<p>Things to learn:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Data structures for storing the text: array, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rope_(data_structure)">rope</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gap_buffer">gap buffer</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piece_table">piece table</a>.</li>
    <li>Behavior and implementation of the text cursor.</li>
    <li>Design patterns for undo/redo: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memento_pattern">memento</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_pattern">command</a>.</li>
    <li>Abstractions to separate the visual and memory aspects of the text.</li>
</ul>

<br><h3>2D game - Space Invaders</h3>

<p>Even the most simple games require some unique data structures and design patterns. The idea here is to implement a well-defined game from start to finish without getting bogged down on the other fun stuff (e.g., game design and art). Also, it is best if you use a barebones 2D graphics library (e.g., SDL, SFML, PyGame), not a big game engine that'll hide all of the interesting bits from you.</p>

<img src="https://austinhenley.com/blog/images/spaceinvaders.png">

<p>First, you'll have to learn to draw to the screen. I had no idea how this worked. You are actually clearing the screen then drawing each portion of the screen in rapid succession, many times a second, to create the effect that objects are moving.</p>

<p>Second, you'll learn all about the game loop. A game is effectively looping between drawing, getting user input, and processing the game logic.</p>

<p>Third, you'll learn how to process user input. I never paid attention to the subtlties of initially pressing, holding, and releasing keys or mouse buttons, let alone handling things like a double click. And how often do you check for user input? If you are constantly checking then that means the rest of the game is frozen!</p>

<p>Fourth, you'll learn how to create and manage all of your game objects and their state. For example, how do you generate a dynamic number of enemies? The factory pattern helps a lot.</p>

<p>Fifth, you'll learn how to apply the game's logic. When do bullet positions get updated? When do more enemies come onscreen? How do you know when an enemy is destroyed? When is the game over? I had never used the modulo operator prior to making games but it is littered all over my games' code.</p> 

<p>Once you get the basic game working, add a title screen menu, a game over screen, make sure the game runs at the same speed even on different computers, and explore how to implement more interesting enemies with AI. Still not enough? Add shader effects, sound, and online multiplayer!</p>


<p>Things to learn:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Drawing to the screen.</li>
    <li>Handling user input.</li>
    <li>Game loop.</li>
    <li>Creating and managing a dynamic number of objects (e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_(object-oriented_programming)">factory pattern</a>).</li>
    <li>State machines for enemy AI.</li>
    <li>Playing sound.</li>
    <li>Using shaders.</li>
    <li>Networking for online features.</li>
</ul>

<br><h3>Compiler - Tiny BASIC</h3>

<p>The most-eye opening projects I have worked on are compilers. Even now, if I have a free Sunday afternoon to do some coding, chances are it is a compiler. It is a great feeling when you create something that enables others to create more things. By implementing one I had to learn so much more about the intricacies of compilers that I normally would never think about (e.g., when do expressions get implicitly type converted).</p>

<p>I suggest writing the compiler from scratch for a very small BASIC-like language (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiny_BASIC">Tiny BASIC</a>) and compile to any other language that you know well. For example, you could write a Tiny BASIC compiler in Python that outputs C# code. It does <b>not</b> have to output assembly or C! Avoiding those will let you focus on the compiler itself.</p>

<img src="https://austinhenley.com/blog/images/peaybasic.png">

<p>The first hurdle is figuring out how to lex (or tokenize) the input code. Then you will parse the code, that is check the structure of the input and produce a tree representation of the code. The recursive descent parsing technique is beautiful! Next you will semantically check the input, ensuring the code makes sense and that the type rules are being followed. Finally, you can generate output!</p>

<p>This project has a ton of existing resources to help you, and a simple compiler can be completed in a few days. Don't let the jargon scare you. Plus the possibilities are endless to what you can add! Once you have the basic compiler working, you can add a standard library (in PeayBASIC I added simple 2D graphics functionality), optimization passes, and improve the error messages. Finally, you should write some example programs in your own language to show off to the world!</p>

<br><h3>Mini Operating System</h3>

<p>Over the years I have found myself applying fundamental concepts from operating systems to a variety of domains, like games and even predictive models of human behavior. In a classroom setting the algorithms and data structures used by operating systems might seem abstract or useless, but they really are useful. Implementing an operating system also helped me understand far more about what is going on under the hood.</p>

<img src="https://austinhenley.com/blog/images/marzos.png">

<p>There is a bit of a learning curve and some barriers to get started since it is dependent on hardware. However, by following a book or tutorial then you should be able to get a bootable OS working that can run your own programs. I highly recommend my colleague's free online book, <a href="http://osblog.stephenmarz.com/index.html">Making a RISC-V Operating System using Rust</a>.</p>

<h3>Spreadsheet</h3>

<p>A spreadsheet application, like Excel, combines some of the challenges from a text editor with those of a compiler. You'll have to learn how to represent the cell contents in memory and implement an interpreter for the programming language used for equations.</p>

</ul>


<br><h3>Video game console emulator</h3>

<p>Writing an emulator (or virtual machine) for a video game console combines the challenges of writing a compiler, an operating system, and a compiler all into one. It is quite rewarding to play a real game made by someone else with your emulator!</p> 

<p>Emulating a real video game console means writing a virtual machine that pretends to function just like the actual CPU and other hardware components. This allows you to run games designed for the video game console with your emulator.</p>

<p>I recommend starting by emulating CHIP-8, which is a simple, fictitious console, before moving on to a real video game console. The NES, SNES, Gameboy, and Gameboy Advance are all quite feasible to emulate, with a far amount of documentation and open source emulators already, though they each have their own quirks to make things interesting (e.g., certain games may rely on undocumented bugs/features of the specific hardware). There is also the PICO-8, which has become a very profitable "fantasy" console.</p>

(WECT) - Chief Judge Richard Myers ruled on Wednesday that the state violated the First Amendment when it told retired engineer Wayne Nutt to stop expressing his opinions about engineering without a state license, per an Institute for Justice announcement.</p><p>Nutt used his experience as an engineer to give his opinions about the designs of public works on the Internet. The NC Board of Examiners and Surveyors claimed that this was punishable by a misdemeanor unless he obtained a professional engineer’s license from the state.</p><p>“This is a win for more than just me,” said Wayne. “There are a lot of people in the same situation—people who have expertise that they’ve been blocked from talking about.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In an era where food security is becoming increasingly challenging, a fascinating study from <a href="https://liu.se/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Linköping University</a> offers a beacon of hope. This research introduces an innovative approach to soilless cultivation, or hydroponics, by integrating an electrically conductive cultivation substrate, aptly named “electronic soil” or eSoil.</p><h2 id="h-the-electronic-soil-revolution">The electronic soil revolution</h2><p><a href="https://cff2.earth.com/uploads/2023/12/25141710/Electronic-soil-with-growing-plant_credit-Thor-Balkhed_1medium.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eleni Stavrinidou</a>, an associate professor at the Laboratory of Organic Electronics at Linköping University and the leader of the <a href="https://liu.se/en/research/laboratory-of-organic-electronics/electronic-plants" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Electronic Plants group</a>, spearheads this pioneering research. Her team’s development of eSoil marks a significant advancement in hydroponics. </p><p>This novel substrate is not only environmentally friendly, being derived from cellulose and a conductive polymer called PEDOT, but it also offers a low-energy, safe alternative to previous methods that relied on high voltage and non-biodegradable materials like mineral wool.</p><p>The study’s findings are nothing short of remarkable. <a href="https://cff2.earth.com/uploads/2023/12/25142417/Electronic-soil-with-growing-plant_barley-seed_credit-Thor-Balkhed_3medium.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Barley seedlings</a>, traditionally not grown in hydroponic systems, exhibited a 50% increase in growth over 15 days when their roots were stimulated electrically using eSoil. </p><p>This discovery not only expands the range of crops suitable for hydroponic cultivation but also demonstrates the potential for more efficient growth with fewer resources.</p><h2 id="h-addressing-global-challenges">Addressing global challenges</h2><p>Stavrinidou emphasizes the urgency of finding new agricultural methods, citing the rising global population and the impact of climate change. </p><p>“The world population is increasing, and we also have climate change. So it’s clear that we won’t be able to cover the <a href="https://www.earth.com/news/reducing-food-waste-greater-food-security-less-environmental-benefits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">food demands</a> of the planet with only the already existing agricultural methods. But with hydroponics we can grow food also in urban environments in very controlled settings,”  Stavrinidou explains.</p><p>Hydroponics, characterized by its soil-free growth medium, reliance on water and nutrients, and a closed system that conserves water and nutrients, is already being used to cultivate crops like lettuce, herbs, and certain vegetables. </p><p>This method is particularly advantageous in areas with limited arable land or harsh environmental conditions.</p><h2 id="h-future-of-urban-agriculture">Future of urban agriculture</h2><p>While the results are promising, Stavrinidou admits that the underlying biological mechanisms are not yet fully understood. </p><p>“In this way, we can get seedlings to grow faster with less resources. We don’t yet know how it actually works, which biological mechanisms that are involved. What we have found is that seedlings process nitrogen more effectively, but it’s not clear yet how the electrical stimulation impacts this process,” says Starvrinidou.</p><p>The research from Linköping University is a significant step toward enhancing <a href="https://www.earth.com/earthpedia-articles/step-into-the-future-urban-farming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">urban agriculture</a>. eSoil’s low energy consumption and safety features, combined with the benefits of hydroponic cultivation, including space efficiency through <a href="https://www.earth.com/news/urban-gardens-promote-biodiversity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vertical farming</a>, present a sustainable solution to the growing demands for food.</p><p>As Stavrinidou cautiously notes, “We can’t say that hydroponics will solve the problem of <a href="https://www.earth.com/news/global-food-system-must-change-if-nations-hope-to-reduce-greenhouse-gas-emissions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">food security</a>. But it can definitely help, particularly in areas with little arable land and with harsh environmental conditions.” </p><p>In summary, this study  sheds light on the potential of hydroponics in urban settings, while also opening the door to further research and innovation in sustainable agriculture.</p><p>The full study was published in the journal <em><a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2304135120" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PNAS</a></em>.</p><p>—–</p><p>Like what you read? <a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Subscribe to our newsletter</a> for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.</p><p>Check us out on <a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EarthSnap</a>, a free app brought to you by <a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eric Ralls</a> and <a href="https://www.earth.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Earth.com</a>. </p><p>—–</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article> <div id="markdown-content"> <p>In a <a href="https://devos50.github.io/blog/2022/ipod-touch-qemu/">previous blog post</a>, I described how I managed to get an iPod Touch 1G up and running using the QEMU emulator. While I’m very happy that the emulator runs smoothly overall, its functionality is limited to some stock apps, not all of which are fully functional. Moreover, I received a few questions on whether it would be possible to run third-party apps. Unfortunately, the iPod Touch 1G (and iPhoneOS 1.0) do not come with the App Store or an SDK; thus, the amount of third-party apps that can run on this particular device and OS is limited.</p> <p>Therefore, I decided to shift focus to emulating an iPod Touch 2G, arguably one of the most popular and iconic iPod Touch devices. This device was also my first Apple product, and it motivated me to pursue iOS development. I targeted iOS 2.1.1, the lowest version of iOS that this device can run. This time, I started by emulating the bootrom and working towards userland emulation and executing SpringBoard, hoping to re-use most of the emulated hardware devices from the iPod Touch 1G. In this blog post, I will describe some challenges I encountered, architectural differences between the iPod Touch 2G and the iPod Touch 1G, and my further plans for emulation. All source code and instructions on how to run the emulator can be found <a href="https://github.com/devos50/qemu-ios" rel="external nofollow noopener noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in this GitHub repository</a>.</p> <p>For reverse engineering and understanding the components, I gratefully used <a href="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/munnerz/379924/raw/056b17f912d76f40d90b0bb8044dd6478d9c885d/iPod%2520Touch%25202G%2520IOReg%2520dump" rel="external nofollow noopener noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this device tree dump</a>, which has been tremendously helpful.</p> <h2 id="ipod-touch-2g-schematic">iPod Touch 2G Schematic</h2> <p>For reference, I created the schematic below to show some of the hardware components this device uses and grouped related elements. However, this schematic still needs to be completed since there are some components I still need to start looking at, such as components related to video encoding/decoding. However, I have some QEMU logic for all components in this diagram, and I believe it highlights how complicated these kinds of embedded devices are from an architectural perspective.</p> <p><a href="https://devos50.github.io/assets/img/ipod_touch_2g_schematic.jpeg"><img src="https://devos50.github.io/assets/img/ipod_touch_2g_schematic.jpeg" width="100%"></a></p> <h2 id="the-first-steps-with-securerom-and-llb">The First Steps with SecureROM and LLB</h2> <p>I started by emulating the 240.4 SecureROM bootrom, which I downloaded from <a href="https://securerom.fun/" rel="external nofollow noopener noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>. Similar to the iPod Touch 1G, the iPod Touch 2G uses the ARMv6 instruction set, so fortunately, I didn’t have to make significant changes to the emulated CPU in QEMU. The bootrom puts the device in DFU mode when a particular button combination is pressed or loads the low-level bootloader (LLB) stored on the NOR memory. Here, things started to be different from the iPod Touch 1G.</p> <p>The first difference is that the iPod Touch 2G has NOR memory accessed through the SPI controller. In comparison, the iPod Touch 1G used CFI flash, the functionality of which was already provided by QEMU. Therefore, I had to reverse engineer the communication protocol with the NOR, which was relatively easy as this protocol is rather straightforward. Its implementation can be found <a href="https://github.com/devos50/qemu-ios/blob/ipod_touch_2g/hw/arm/ipod_touch_nor_spi.c" rel="external nofollow noopener noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>.</p> <p>The second, more challenging difference is that the iPod Touch 2G uses the more secure IMG3 file format (instead of IMG2) to store binaries on the NOR/NAND. Luckily, IMG3 has been <a href="https://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/IMG3_File_Format" rel="external nofollow noopener noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">well-documented</a>, but it involves quite a bit of cryptographic operations, including RSA signatures and hashes to guarantee authenticity and integrity. Since I aim to get an emulator as close to the hardware as possible, I wanted to avoid patching the binaries to turn off signature verification. Therefore, I had to get the PKE engine up and running, which is responsible for modulo arithmetic when verifying RSA signatures. I computed the resulting numbers using OpenSSL’s <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/3/bn_mod_exp" rel="external nofollow noopener noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BIGNUM functionality</a>. Even though my implementation is <a href="https://github.com/devos50/qemu-ios/blob/ipod_touch_2g/hw/arm/ipod_touch_pke.c#L85" rel="external nofollow noopener noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a bit hacky</a>, it seems to pass the signature verification of all IMG3 images that are loaded.</p> <p>Some IMG3 images also rely on <a href="https://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/UID_key" rel="external nofollow noopener noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the UID key</a>, a key unique to each Apple device and fused into the application processor during manufacturing. Since I don’t have access to this key, I generated one myself and used that one <a href="https://github.com/devos50/qemu-ios-generate-nor/blob/ipod_touch_2g/generate_nor.c#L34" rel="external nofollow noopener noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">when storing IMG3 files on the NOR/NAND</a>. I then define the same key in the AES engine.</p> <p>I re-used many iPod Touch 1G emulator hardware components, including the timers, clocks, and vector interrupt controllers. It was straightforward to get past LLB as its main responsibility was initializing hardware components and loading iBoot, the main bootloader.</p> <h2 id="iboot-and-the-nand">iBoot and the NAND</h2> <p>For several months, I have been stuck in various functions of iBoot. The first challenge came from the LCD, which uses a different underlying communication protocol (MIPI-DSIM) than the iPod Touch 1G. The second challenge, which was much more difficult, was to get the NAND working where iBoot loads the kernel image from. The NAND in the iPod Touch 2G has two main differences from the iPod Touch 1G. First, the NAND driver uses a different communication protocol, referred to as FMSS in the kernel. Second, there were some significant differences in the VFL/FTL specifications, so I had to spend quite some time understanding the mapping function that translates a logical block number to a physical one.</p> <p>In the iPod Touch 1G and iPhoneOS 1.0, I could easily pass boot args to the kernel. However, Apple has turned off this functionality in production mode for the iPod Touch 2G. Therefore, I had to manually write this string to the appropriate location in kernel memory. There are probably better solutions than this, but some boot flags were necessary to set to get debug output printed to the terminal.</p> <div><pre><code>const char *boot_args = "kextlog=0xfff debug=0x8 cpus=1 rd=disk0s1 serial=1 pmu-debug=0x1 io=0xffff8fff debug-usb=0xffffffff";
cpu_physical_memory_write(0x0ff2a584, boot_args, strlen(boot_args));
</code></pre></div> <p>I also spent quite some effort getting past the kernel image’s signature verification. For some reason, my decryption algorithm does not correctly decrypt the final block when the length of the data is not a multiple of the key size, causing the CRC computation to fail. I am still unsure what I am doing wrong here, but to work around this, I patched the expected CRC code with the code I get during decryption. This workaround correctly validates the kernel image but should still be revised.</p> <h2 id="booting-the-kernel-and-springboard">Booting the Kernel and SpringBoard</h2> <p>The kernel boots most of the hardware components defined in the device tree. I did not have too many difficulties getting past the initialization of the remaining hardware components. IOKit, Apple’s framework for implementing drivers, is very well-structured, and its debug output makes it easy to identify when and where a driver gets stuck.</p> <p>When the kernel has booted, it launches <code>launchd</code>, which executes different system daemons, including SpringBoard. The configuration of most of these daemons is located in <code>/System/Library/LaunchDaemons.</code> The iPod Touch 2G has many different daemons, including ones related to media, DNS, FairPlay, and iTunes. To simplify things, I only enabled the necessary daemons to get SpringBoard operational and disabled all others for the time being.</p> <p>I was very happy that the multitouch driver worked out of the box since I spent quite some time getting it functional for the iPod Touch 1G. With that, I now have a basic iPod Touch 2G emulator!</p> <p><a href="https://devos50.github.io/assets/img/ipod_touch_2g_home.png"><img src="https://devos50.github.io/assets/img/ipod_touch_2g_home.png" width="400"></a></p> <h2 id="working-towards-wifi">Working towards WiFi</h2> <p>After SpringBoard became operational, I wanted to know how difficult it would be to get the WiFi controller functional. The iPod Touch 2G uses a Broadcom BCM4325, and one can communicate with that device through the SDIO controller. This driver is included in the kernel as a kernel module. I noticed that the kernel would not automatically load the BCM4325 kernel module, and to date, I’m still trying to figure out where and how exactly this module is loaded. To work around this issue, I <a href="https://github.com/devos50/qemu-ios/blob/ipod_touch_2g/hw/arm/ipod_touch_mbx.c#L33" rel="external nofollow noopener noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">patched the kernel</a> and added some instructions to load this kernel module manually. Again, it’s not ideal, but at least these drivers are loaded now.</p> <p>The SDIO standard is well-documented, and it took little time to get that part up and running. The BCM4325 hardware is more complicated, and the iOS kernel uploads a Linux kernel image to the device as part of the boot procedure. The hardware also has many registers, and their content is unclear. However, with some hacking, I could get past the initialization procedure, as seen in the screenshot below. The initialization procedure sometimes hangs, probably because of race conditions or other timing issues. However, full WiFi emulation is far from functional as basic primitives such as SSID scanning or connecting to a network are still not implemented.</p> <p><a href="https://devos50.github.io/assets/img/bcm4325.jpeg"><img src="https://devos50.github.io/assets/img/bcm4325.jpeg" width="100%"></a></p> <h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2> <p>I enjoyed working on this next step in emulating legacy Apple devices and improving my understanding of the hardware components in the iPod Touch 2G. I believe the iPod Touch 2G is more stable and easier to work with than the iPod Touch 1G and has quite some potential since it can natively run third-party applications. Below, I list some follow-up steps that would improve the usability of the emulator.</p> <ul> <li>Running <code>bash</code> would make debugging processes, executing applications, and collecting statistics from the device much easier. I have yet to look into this.</li> <li>I would also like to make installing third-party apps on the emulator much easier, which now requires a full rebuild of the NAND memory.</li> <li>Some compilation issues need to be resolved for the emulator to run on other platforms, including Windows and Linux.</li> <li>NAND persistence still needs to be fixed, e.g., writes to the NAND are not stored across sessions.</li> </ul> <p>I’m also happy to announce that I will give a talk about this project at FOSDEM’24 in Brussels, also see <a href="https://fosdem.org/2024/schedule/event/fosdem-2024-2826-breathing-life-into-legacy-an-open-source-emulator-of-legacy-apple-devices/" rel="external nofollow noopener noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>. Hope to see you there!</p> <p>As always, please let me know what you think by opening an issue on the GitHub repository, or by leaving a comment below.</p>      </div> </article></div>]]></description>

<p>First, we would like to apologize for the lack of blog posts this year. We planned to do more, but other priorities kept getting in the way. We continued to provide updates through our Discord and social medias during this time, but we plan to use this blog more often now.</p>
<p>This blog post will be a bit more serious than previous posts, as the subject matter is rather somber. We apologize for the lack of energy and quips you may have enjoyed in previous posts. This post will have information regarding several aspects of the shutdown, some of which have been covered on other social media posts. Please use the table of contents below to jump to your desired section.</p>

<h2 id="the-shutdown">The Shutdown</h2>
<p>In October of 2023, Nintendo <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/63227/~/announcement-of-discontinuation-of-online-services-for-nintendo-3ds-and-wii-u">announced the shutdown of Nintendo Network</a> for April of 2024. It was stated that a specific date and time would be announced later, and as of this post that has not happened yet. There have been no public announcements of any services shutting down early, though Nintendo stated they reserve they right to do so if:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"an event occurs that would make it difficult to continue online services for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U software"</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, it appears that Nintendo has begun a slow rollout of shutdowns. Intentional or not.</p>
<h2 id="super-mario-maker">Super Mario Maker</h2>
<p>This information was also detailed in a <a href="https://twitter.com/PretendoNetwork/status/1736325668412031255">Twitter thread</a>. You may read this there if you wish, or read the repost below.</p>
<p>Some time in early December 2023, Super Mario Maker began throwing error <code>106-0502</code> very often when trying to connect. It is unclear when this truly began, but the earliest occurrences we could find were around the 8th of December. Upon inspection, the cause for this error was clear: the server the game was attempting to connect to no longer existed. Our first assumption was that this was the beginning of the shutdown early, that Nintendo may have started turning off games without notice. After some more research, however, we discovered some users able to still connect.</p>
<p>Games on Nintendo Network function using 3 servers:</p>
<ol>
<li>The account server, which tells the client the location of the game's authentication server and provides the client with a token to connect with.</li>
<li>The game's authentication server, which logs the user in using the internal NEX account (details on this in the <a href="#new-accounts-prerequisite">New Accounts (Prerequisite)</a> section), and tells the client the location of the game's secure server.</li>
<li>The game's secure server, which is where all the game play content happens at.</li>
</ol>
<p>Every game on Nintendo Network uses the same 2 authentication servers. However each game has many dedicated secure servers. When logging in, the authentication server gives one of many randomly selected addresses to connect to. We believe this is some form of load balancing, splitting connections between many servers. The issue resulting in <code>106-0502</code> is that the authentication server is now giving clients addresses to dead servers. So far, we have only been able to identify a single working address for the game.</p>
<p>We believe this is due to Nintendo attempting to scale back how many servers are running for each game, to save on costs as the shutdown date approaches. They most likely made an error in their presumed load balancer to not remove these now dead servers from the pool of available addresses. We believe this was done completely unintentionally, however Nintendo shows no signs of fixing this error.</p>
<h2 id="new-accounts-prerequisite">New Accounts (Prerequisite)</h2>
<p>As briefly touched on in <a href="#super-mario-maker">Super Mario Maker</a>, Nintendo actually uses a series of internal accounts for several services. For games, these are called "NEX accounts". Some background knowledge is required for this section, which will be gone over now.</p>
<p>NEX is the software Nintendo uses for all 3DS and WiiU games (and some Switch games). It is based on a library called Rendez-Vous, made by Canadian software company <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040610104624/http://www.quazal.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=Sections&amp;file=index&amp;req=viewarticle&amp;artid=101&amp;page=1">Quazal</a>. Quazal, before being bought out by Ubisoft, would license Rendez-Vous to anyone. Many games, on many platforms, by many developers, all use some variation of Rendez-Vous as it was highly extensible. This is why our server libraries are <a href="https://twitter.com/PretendoNetwork/status/1727016210435641508">theoretically compatible with Ubisoft games</a>.</p>
<p>Nintendo licensed Rendez-Vous and modified it quite a bit, stripping out some more complex features and adding in some custom protocols, rebranding it to NEX. The important takeaway here is that Nintendo did not build this system from scratch, and instead modified a system made for generic game server usage.</p>
<h2 id="new-accounts">New Accounts</h2>
<p>Some time in late December 2023, new accounts could no longer go online in any games on both the WiiU and 3DS.</p>
<p>As mentioned in <a href="#new-accounts-prerequisite">New Accounts (Prerequisite)</a>, Nintendo did not make their game server software from scratch. Rendez-Vous comes with its own account system, likely due to it being designed for use in one-off games. At the time of its development, online multiplayer games were still very new and the concept of a unified account system (such as Nintendo Network or Uplay) spanning many different games made by the same company, was not a thing. Therefore, Nintendo needed to cope with this existing account system in some way.</p>
<p>On the 3DS, the console registers a new NEX account on the Friends server once during the console's setup process. Each 3DS, under normal circumstances, will only ever have a single account at a time (though this is not <em>always</em> true, but not relevant). This is why a NNID is not required to play most games online on the 3DS, as games use your NEX account to login to all game servers. Because of this, a new NEX account will never be created again unless the old one is removed using CFW or by factory resetting the console.</p>
<p>On the WiiU, a new NEX account is created automatically when the NNID is registered, and the NEX account is linked to this NNID. The console then alerts the Friends server of the new NEX account, much like 3DS. Despite using NNIDs, the WiiU also uses these NEX accounts to go online in all games.</p>
<p>Once a NEX account has been created, the Friends server synchronizes this account with all other game servers on Nintendo Network. This is due to the aforementioned account system provided by Rendez-Vous. Due to each game having their own server, and Rendez-Vous not having the concept of a unified account system, each game server has its own account system internally, which is synchronized with other games. It is actually possible to create accounts in other servers besides the Friends server if using a modified client, and those accounts will be usable in other games.</p>
<p>This synchronization process has been stopped. New NEX accounts are no longer being synchronized with any other servers on the network. This affects all games. Because of this, any attempt to connect to any game using an account made after this change was made will result in error <code>106-0303</code> on the WiiU and <code>006-0303</code> on the 3DS, internally called <code>RendezVous::InvalidUsername</code>.</p>
<p>It is not clear at this time whether this was intentional or not.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>We ask that you do not spam Nintendo's support lines with these issues. Doing so may cause Nintendo to pull the plug entirely early. There are only 3 possible scenarios:</p>
<ol>
<li>Nintendo is aware of these issues already, and spam would annoy them to the point of pulling the plug.</li>
<li>Nintendo is not aware of these issues, and alerting them may cause them to pull the plug. They have already stated that anything making things "difficult" may come with an early shutdown.</li>
<li>These issues were intentional, and spam would annoy them to the point of pulling the plug.</li>
</ol>

<p dir="auto">This is a powerful locally hosted web based PDF manipulation tool using docker that allows you to perform various operations on PDF files, such as splitting merging, converting, reorganizing, adding images, rotating, compressing, and more. This locally hosted web application started as a 100% ChatGPT-made application and has evolved to include a wide range of features to handle all your PDF needs.</p>
<p dir="auto">Stirling PDF makes no outbound calls for any record keeping or tracking.</p>
<p dir="auto">All files and PDFs are either purely client side, in server memory only during the execution of the task or within a temporay file only for execution of the task.
Any file which has been downloaded by the user will have already been deleted from the server by that time.</p>

<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Extra notes</h3>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Endpoints. Currently, the endpoints ENDPOINTS_TO_REMOVE and GROUPS_TO_REMOVE can include comma separate lists of endpoints and groups to disable as example ENDPOINTS_TO_REMOVE=img-to-pdf,remove-pages would disable both image-to-pdf and remove pages, GROUPS_TO_REMOVE=LibreOffice Would disable all things that use LibreOffice. You can see a list of all endpoints and groups <a href="https://github.com/Frooodle/Stirling-PDF/blob/main/Endpoint-groups.md">here</a></li>
<li>customStaticFilePath. Customise static files such as the app logo by placing files in the /customFiles/static/ directory. An example of customising app logo is placing a /customFiles/static/favicon.svg to override current SVG. This can be used to change any images/icons/css/fonts/js etc in Stirling-PDF</li>
</ul>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Environment only parameters</h3>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>SYSTEM_ROOTURIPATH</code> ie set to <code>/pdf-app</code> to Set the application's root URI to <code>localhost:8080/pdf-app</code></li>

<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Prerequisites:</h3>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>User must have the folder ./configs volumed within docker so that it is retained during updates.</li>
<li>Docker uses must download the security jar version by setting <code>DOCKER_ENABLE_SECURITY</code> to <code>true</code> in environment variables.</li>
<li>Then either enable login via the settings.yml file or via setting <code>SECURITY_ENABLE_LOGIN</code> to <code>true</code></li>
<li>Now the initial user will be generated with username <code>admin</code> and password <code>stirling</code>. On login you will be forced to change the password to a new one. You can also use the environment variables <code>SECURITY_INITIALLOGIN_USERNAME</code> and  <code>SECURITY_INITIALLOGIN_PASSWORD</code> to set your own straight away (Recommended to remove them after user creation).</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Once the above has been done, on restart, a new stirling-pdf-DB.mv.db will show if everything worked.</p>
<p dir="auto">When you login to Stirling PDF you will be redirected to /login page to login with those default credentials. After login everything should function as normal</p>
<p dir="auto">To access your account settings go to Account settings in the settings cog menu (top right in navbar) This Account settings menu is also where you find your API key.</p>
<p dir="auto">To add new users go to the bottom of Account settings and hit 'Admin Settings', here you can add new users. The different roles mentioned within this are for rate limiting. This is a Work in progress which will be expanding on more in future</p>
<p dir="auto">For API usage you must provide a header with 'X-API-Key' and the associated API key for that user.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">FAQ</h2>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Q1: What are your planned features?</h3>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Progress bar/Tracking</li>
<li>Full custom logic pipelines to combine multiple operations together.</li>
<li>Folder support with auto scanning to perform operations on</li>
<li>Redact text (Via UI not just automated way)</li>
<li>Add Forms</li>
<li>Multi page layout (Stich PDF pages together) support x rows y columns and custom page sizing</li>
<li>Fill forms mannual and automatic</li>
</ul>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Q2: Why is my application downloading .htm files?</h3>
<p dir="auto">This is a issue caused commonly by your NGINX congifuration. The default file upload size for NGINX is 1MB, you need to add the following in your Nginx sites-available file. <code>client_max_body_size SIZE;</code> Where "SIZE" is 50M for example for 50MB files.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Q3: Why is my download timing out</h3>
<p dir="auto">NGINX has timeout values by default so if you are running Stirling-PDF behind NGINX you may need to set a timeout value such as adding the config <code>proxy_read_timeout 3600;</code></p>

<p>This map story is about one specific map, the only one remaining from the Roman Empire. The map is 6.8 meters long, 33 centimeters tall and spans from today’s western France to Sri Lanka and from Aswan in the south to The Hague in the north — almost the entire extent of the known world. It shows the routes of the <strong>Cursus Publicus,</strong> the state-administered road network for couriers and official transportation. We know it as the <strong><a href="https://www.omnesviae.org/de/viewer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tabula Peutingeriana</a></strong>.</p>

facsimile of Peutinger’s copy of the map</figcaption></figure>



<p>Its name comes from the 16th century collector <strong>Konrad Peutinger,</strong> who owned the only copy of the map to survive the Middle Ages; it was made in the 1200s and consists of <strong>11 separate parchment panels</strong>. There was most likely a 12th panel showing the westernmost parts of the empire, including Britain, the Iberian Peninsula, and Morocco, but it hasn’t survived to the present day.</p>

<h3>Traveling the Cursus Publicus</h3>



<p>The Cursus Publicus was initiated by Emperor Augustus in 27 BC to 14 AD as a fast, secure service for <strong>government and military communication</strong> and <strong>official travel around the empire.</strong> Stations were located at intervals of one day's travel along its roads, with all stations providing <strong>facilities</strong> to repair vehicles, change horses (or mules, or donkeys), and rest for the night. Some also offered <strong>extra amenities,</strong> such as baths, luxurious lodging, temples, or fortifications. This made it possible for Augustus to introduce a system of one courier carrying each parcel or message all the way to its destination, instead relaying them from person to person as in earlier times.</p>



<p>The roads carried traffic as well as messengers, but they weren’t open to just anyone; <strong>travelers had to carry a permit</strong> from the government or military stating their name, dates of travel, and the route and lodgings to be taken. Forging of permits was not uncommon.</p>



<h3>A closer look at the Tabula Peutingeriana</h3>



<p>At first glance, it’s hard to recognize the shape of Europe on this map. To fit the format of the panels, the geography is <strong>heavily stretched and distorted:</strong> the Italian peninsula, for example, takes up a third of the entire map and is rotated so that its length seems to run from east to west instead of north to south. Some elements of the natural geography such as water, forests and rivers are present, but all are very distorted. This isn’t because ancient people didn’t know what the world really looks like — the Ptolemy world map was well known at this time and cartography was a recognized field of science.</p>

<p>But if you just <strong>focus on the roads,</strong> which are drawn in red, it’s clear where they lead and how various cities are connected. In other words, the Tabula Peutingeriana does look like a modern map — a modern transit map.</p>



<h3>The math of transit maps</h3>



<p>A public transit map is usually not geographically correct; it shows only what you need to get from station A to station B. Any other information — <strong>scale, distance, the exact position of the stops, and features of the city other than its transit lines</strong> — is stripped off the map to make it as easy as possible for passengers to find their route. The most abstract transit maps, showing only lines and stations, can be described as mathematical <strong>graphs.</strong></p>

<p>A graph is a mathematical object in which certain points, or <strong>vertices</strong>, are connected by lines, or <strong>edges</strong>. The nature of the graph is determined by the number of vertices and the particular way that the edges connect them. Everything else about it — <strong>where exactly we place the vertices, how long the edges are, whether they’re straight or curved or loopy</strong> — is irrelevant, mathematically speaking.</p>



<p>In fact, maps have been part of graph theory from the very beginning, ever since Leonard Euler introduced it as a field of mathematics in the late 1700s. In his paper on the seven bridges of Königsberg, he proved that in that city, where <strong>four land masses</strong> were connected by <strong>seven bridges</strong>, it was impossible to cross all seven bridges without crossing any bridge twice. What Euler did was to remove all features of the landscape except the land masses and bridges, and consider the <strong>land masses as vertices</strong> and <strong>bridges as edges connecting them.</strong> Since that graph preserves all the important information about how to get from one land mass to another (just like a transit map!), he could use it as a simple representation of the city in his proof.</p>







<p>Neither a modern transit map nor the Tabula Peutingeriana are cartographic maps — they are visualizations of graphs. The couriers’ stations are the graph’s vertices and each stretch of road connecting two stations is an edge. (In fact, the word tabula is a Latin term that can also mean chart, diagram, or figure.)</p>



<p>Just like in a modern transit map, <strong>zones with a lot of roads might be enlarged or distorted</strong> to show the network more clearly. This “distorted” view makes it easier to display the most important information: what route leads to your destination and which stations it passes along the way.</p>

<h3>Reading and using the Tabula Peutingeriana</h3>



<p>The map names 555 cities and 3500 other waystations. Each stop is marked with symbols showing the facilities on offer, including <strong>temples, harbors, public baths, and fortified walls</strong>. The most important cities — Rome, Constantinople, and Antioch — are marked with more decorated symbols.</p>







<p>Scholars think that travelers in the Roman Empire <strong>didn’t actually carry their maps on the road.</strong> They would have been inconvenient to copy out, and carrying around a seven meter long map sounds very impractical anyway. Instead, travelers would bring an <strong>itinerarium</strong> — a written list of destinations and their connections and distances to other cities nearby. These would have been cheaper to produce, so a traveler could easily get hold of an itinerary for the direction they were heading.</p>



<p>So when would the map have been used? Since there are no classical sources that mention the Tabula Peutingeriana, or any other road map, it’s hard to know exactly. It might have been used to <strong>plan longer trips in advance</strong>, or for <strong>political and military planning</strong> purposes.</p>



<p>The map also includes some information that doesn’t seem practical at all. For example, over India is a note reading <em>In hic locis elephanti nascuntur</em> (“Elephants are born here”). The furthest extent of the empire of Alexander the Great, in modern Tajikistan, is also marked with the note <em>Hic Alexander responsum accepit usq. quo Alexander</em> (“Here Alexander received an answer [to the question]: How far, Alexander?”) Some researchers argue that the map was not only a tool for navigating, but also a way to <strong>display the power of the Roman Empire.</strong> Roads were more important than conquered cities; without roads, there would be no way to send messages, move military troops, transport food and trade goods, and keep the entire Empire together.</p>







<h3>Life of the map</h3>



<p>There is no exact date for the first version of the map. It must have been copied many times, but the only copy to have survived to our days was made around the year 1200, 700 years after the fall of the Roman Empire. Every time the map was copied, the person drawing it had a chance to make their own additions and mistakes. The result is that the map <strong>mixes different centuries,</strong> showing a reality that never existed at any single point in time.</p>



<p>For example, the city of <strong>Pompeii</strong> is marked on the map even though it was abandoned after the volcanic eruption of 79 CE. But the map also has “Constantinople” instead of <strong>Byzantinum</strong> (its common name until 500 CE) and “Jerusalem” instead of <strong>Aelia Capitolina</strong> (as it was known to the Romans from 135–324 CE). Sometimes roads even appear duplicated because the same city is shown multiple times under different historical names. Certain additions were clearly made by Christian copyists, like the spot in the Sinai desert reading <em>Hic legem acceperunt i(n) monte Syna</em>&nbsp;(“Here on Mount Sinai they received the law”).</p>



<p>There is no information on the whereabouts of the map from the time it was first produced until the surviving copy was made. That copy was <strong>rediscovered <strong>in the library of the city Wor</strong>ms in 14<strong>94</strong>, </strong>and most probably stolen from  there by Conrad Celtes, a scholar and poet of the German Renaissance. Before Celtes died, he gave the map to his good friend Konrad Peutinger, whose family kept it for the next 200 years, giving it their name. For noble families in the Holy Roman Empire, artifacts that <strong>connected their empire to the ancient Romans</strong> had a special significance. The Peutinger family sold the map in 1714 and eventually in 1737 it was bought by the Habsburg Imperial Court Library in Vienna — now the Austrian National Library — <a href="https://digital.onb.ac.at/RepViewer/viewer.faces?doc=DTL_2764184" target="_blank" rel="noopener">where it still lives today.</a></p>

<p>There are lots of commercial alarm clocks with integrated clock projector on the market but I thought, it would be fun to build one myself.</p>
<p>Moreover it was a good project for becoming&nbsp;accustomed to the process of 3d-designing cases which can be 3d printed and to learn about designing tolerances.</p>
<p>The principle is easy – basically it works like a video beamer (or any other projecting clock^^).</p>

<h2>LCD and Calculations</h2>
<p>I choosed a small negative (background black) 64×32 LCD which has the dimensions of just 15mm x 12mm (active area 11.18mm x 5.58mm).</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="53" data-permalink="https://microengineer.eu/2018/05/01/diy-night-clock-projector/lcd/" data-orig-file="https://microengineer332294991.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/lcd.png" data-orig-size="398,347" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="lcd" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://microengineer332294991.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/lcd.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://microengineer332294991.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/lcd.png?w=398" src="https://microengineer332294991.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/lcd.png?w=1000" alt="lcd" srcset="https://microengineer332294991.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/lcd.png 398w, https://microengineer332294991.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/lcd.png?w=150&amp;h=131 150w, https://microengineer332294991.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/lcd.png?w=300&amp;h=262 300w" sizes="(max-width: 398px) 100vw, 398px"></p>
<p>The goal was to build a complete projector with not more than 50mm x 50mm x 50mm (which I didn’t managed … But close to^^).</p>
<p>A small LCD has the advantage that everything becomes smaller and cheaper – this influences heavily costs for optics because a smaller LCD needs smaller optics to project an low distorted image.</p>
<p>Moreover a smaller LCD needs smaller focal length for a decent sized imaged on the ceiling. A good distance would be 2m from LCD to ceiling.</p>
<p>The formula for image width depending from the focal length is defined as:</p>

<p>with:<br>
– S2 distance from lens to LCD and<br>
– S1 distance from lens to ceiling<br>
– W2 is the width of the LCD<br>
– W1 is the width of the projected image</p>
<p>The formulas show that the smaller the focal length the larger the projected image will be.</p>
<p>I decided to go for 25mm because there are cheap lenses which can be obtained for about $12 in china.</p>
<p>For our values that would magnify the image by about x80 – 11.1mm LCD width would become 88.1cm image width on the ceiling in a distance of 2m.</p>
<h2>Light and Condensor Lens</h2>
<p>It was not really clear how strong a LED has to be in order to get a reasonable well readable picture in the night on the ceiling.</p>
<p>To be sure – actually I wasn’t really – I decided to use a high power LED with 1W and use a cheap chinese condensor lense to parallelize the light before it passes the LCD (this has do be done anyway but a condensor lens makes it possible to use more light because condensors are shaped in a way that allowes to get the lens as near to the LED as possible – so catching more light).</p>

<p>The two pictures show the condensor-lense which is directly mounted to the PCB the resulting light spot on the ceiling. It is a really gread lens which is made for my LED – so it fits perfectly and parallelizes the light nicely.</p>
<h2>Electronics Construction</h2>
<p>Two PCBs were designed – one holding the LCD and the actual projecting board.</p>

<p>The latter is equipped with 1W LED driver, STM32F103 Cortex ARM, a rotary encoder (for changing settings like brightness, standby-timer, time, …), USB, IR (both not used yet).</p>
<h2>Mechanics Construction</h2>
<p>Originally, I aimed for 50mm x 50mm x 50mm but I only managed to get to 60mm x 60mm x 60mm 😥 😉</p>
<p>Here an overview about all I designed:</p>

<p>From left to right: Case with DIY projection lens (I skip this part – it worked but not really well), Sony E-Mount, C-Mount. In the middle the rest.</p>
<h3>LCD-Holder</h3>
<p>A custom LCD-holder was designed to perfectly mount the LCD on the right place on the PCB.</p>

<h3>Case – C-Mount Variant</h3>
<p>There are incredibly cheap chinase C-Mount lenses with a focal length of 25mm. They are sooo cheap that image quality is really really bad when using for fotography.</p>

We were looking for a good way to turn high-level product asks into actionable work and Discovery Trees fit the bill for us.

                  <p><span>The biggest missing element, in my mind, of the pro-"classicist" and anti-"mockist" view is that the practice of writing unit tests with mocking leads to refactoring your code until it works with that approach, which in turn leads to better-designed code. I don't like the emphasis of "yeah but refactoring code leads to needing to rewrite mocked tests", because if you've designed your code well, then the need to adjust an api boundary should be less frequent than the need to adjust the internal implementation details. Focusing on integration tests means you can get away with poorly designed code full of corner cases that your integration tests can't catch. Besides, "we can keep the fast feedback loop with parallel tests" really increases the demands on complicated tooling that breaks often.</span></p></div></td></tr>
