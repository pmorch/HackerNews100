            <pubDate>Tue, 09 Jan 2024 09:18:53 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://calv.info/heat-pumps">https://calv.info/heat-pumps</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38923969">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Over the last few months, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bakershogry/">Baker</a> and I have been digging in deep on <a href="https://heatpumpshooray.com/">Heat Pumps</a>. I'm putting my explorations here on pause but wanted to write up everything we've learned over the last few months.</p>
<p>Heat pumps are unique in that they are a tool for fighting climate change, where <strong>we have the technology <em>today</em></strong>. It's the same tech that we've been using in refrigerators and AC units for decades. Switching to heat pumps would reduce <a href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions">hundreds of MT of CO2 emissions per year</a>. And yet, they are only present in <a href="https://www.eia.gov/consumption/residential/data/2020/hc/pdf/HC%206.1.pdf">15% of US single-family homes</a>.</p>
<p>Unlike more speculative areas of climate tech, adopting heat pumps en-masse is more a question of <strong>deployment</strong>. There are barriers with <strong>financing</strong>, the <strong>purchase journey</strong>, the <strong>large up-front install cost</strong>, and the <strong>lack of differentiated outcomes</strong>. I'll get to all of these down below.</p>
<p>Overall, it feels like a space which is ripe for disruption, which is why you see a lot of startup founders starting to investigate this space. Every step in the process today is broken, which means that there is a lot to improve.</p>
<p><em>Author's note: I'm not a grizzled heat pump or HVAC expert, so it's certainly possible I got some stuff wrong. What follows is the result of about six months of research. If you have a correction, please reach out.</em></p>
<h2>Types of heat pumps</h2>
<p>If you're totally new to the space: <strong>heat pumps are a high-efficiency, climate-friendly option to heat and cool your home</strong>. They run on pure electricity, and are 3-4x more efficient than existing electric options. They are one of our best tools in the fight against climate change, and should be deployed in every home in America.</p>
<div><p><img src="https://calv.info/heat-pumps/heat-pump-cycle.jpg"></p><p><span>The heat pump cycle. Via https://airteamltd.com/</span></p></div>
<p>Heat pumps consist of the same set of components...</p>
<p><strong>An outdoor unit</strong> which either collects heat from the outdoors to be brought inside, or releases heat collected from indoors. It will typically have a fan to move air across a set of coils (metal) which conduct heat from the refrigerant. there are two primary styles of these: "barrel-style" which look more like a traditional AC unit and "box-style" which are the boxes you see on <a href="http://heatpumpshooray.com/">Heat Pumps, Hooray!</a>.</p>
<div><p><img src="https://calv.info/heat-pumps/mitsubishi-unit.jpg"></p><p><span>An outdoor unit</span></p></div>
<p><strong>An indoor unit (or indoor heads)</strong> which either pulls heat in from inside the home or disperses it out. think of it as functionally the same thing as the outdoor unit, but it sits <em>inside</em> your house and looks different based on how heat is distributed throughout the home (see below)</p>
<p><strong>Refrigerant lines</strong> which exchange heat between the indoors and outdoors. these are metal tubes that carry a substance known as refrigerant which has an extremely low boiling point.</p>
<p><strong>A compressor</strong> which is used to modulate pressure of the refrigerant</p>
<p><strong>A reversing-valve</strong> which changes the directional flow of refrigerant to either heat or cool your home. when you adjust the thermostat 'mode', it is effectively changing the direction of the reversing-valve.</p>
<p><strong>Sometimes: heat strips / resistive heating</strong>: in <em>very</em> cold climates below -5 degrees F, heat pump capacity will go down to the point where it may have trouble meeting the heating load. To combat this, certain heat pumps ship with resistive elements (imagine a toaster oven that generates heat by running through a wire).</p>
<p>Additionally, there are a few other 'flavors' of heat pumps depending on your home setup, but all of these consist of the same core parts.</p>
<h4>Heat pump flavors: how heat is distributed</h4>
<p>If you want to install a heat pump in your home, you have several options for how that process works.</p>
<p><strong>Option 1: Central-ducted</strong> - most US homes have duct-work to move heat (and air!) throughout the house. In these systems, there's a central set of tubes which run air throughout the house, kind of like blood vessels will carry blood throughout the body. Centrally ducted heat pumps are the most popular, since about 60% of US homes already have ducts. If you have ducts, using that ductwork is typically the cheapest and most effective way to distribute heat.</p>
<p><strong>Option 2: Mini-split aka ductless</strong> - for homes without duct-work, or cases where you want to condition a specific room (e.g. think of a garage), you can use a mini-split unit. This works in the same way as the central units, but instead of hiding the indoor unit in a basement or closet, they are instead mounted visibly on the walls. Refrigerant lines will run directly from an outdoor unit to an indoor one. Because these can't heat the whole home, they are typically smaller. In some cases, you can route refrigerant to multiple 'heads' inside the home.</p>
<div><p><img src="https://calv.info/heat-pumps/mini-split.jpg"></p><p><span>Mini-split units don't use central ducts and instead sit on your wall</span></p></div>
<p><strong>Option 3: Mono-block or 'packaged'</strong> - there's one other type of heat pump which is generally less popular because it's not as flexible or performant for many housing configurations, the 'mono-block' unit. These combine indoor and outdoor units into a single form factor that sits outside the house, and then moves air inside. It benefits from simplicity of install (no refrigerant lines), but won't be nearly as efficient as a split system and has a bigger outdoor footprint.</p>
<p><strong>Option 4: Air-to-water</strong> - for households who have radiant heating, heat pumps (or heat pump water heaters) can exchange heat with water. This is less popular in the US, but a popular way to heat in Europe.</p>
<h4>Heat pump flavors: heating sources</h4>
<p>In addition to how heat is distributed inside, there are also differences in how heat pumps.</p>
<p><strong>Air-source heat pumps</strong> are the most common heat pump variety, that you see everywhere. These exchange heat with the outside air, just like an AC Unit.</p>
<div><p><img src="https://calv.info/heat-pumps/air-source-heat-pump.jpg"></p><p><span>Air-source heat pumps sit outside your home</span></p></div>
<p><strong>Dual-fuel</strong> - a dual fuel heat pump setup is basically the same as centrally ducted, but it just means that you <em>don't</em> replace your existing furnace, and have the heat pump installed alongside it. This is a popular route for homeowners looking to gradually transition. With dual-fuel, the heat pump and the gas furnace can never run simultaneously, so it won't save much money on heating. But it can be useful for gradually moving to electric heating.</p>
<p><strong>Air-to-ground (aka ground-source)</strong> - in extreme climates (think the northeast), heat pump heating and cooling both become lower efficiency. pulling heat out of the very cold air is hard to do, as is pushing heat into hot humid days. it turns out that if you <a href="https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/geothermal-heat-pumps">drill down ~30-40 feet, the soil temperature will remain more or less constant throughout the year</a>. this gives a heat pump much better efficiency.</p>
<h2>The market</h2>
<p>Today's market participants are split into a few different layers: <strong>consumers, contractors and technicians, wholesalers, and manufacturers</strong>.</p>
<p>Let's start with <strong>consumers</strong>. Furnace equipment typically has a lifetime of 20 years, while AC equipment has a lifetime of more like 15 years. When your furnace or AC dies (or perhaps you want to get an AC for the first time), you have a magical window of opportunity to upgrade to a heat pump.</p>
<p>Today, most consumers will either call the number on the side of the unit left by the original installer (an ingenious and basically zero-cost lead-flow technique), or will search on Yelp, Angie's List, or Google to find a contractor. Typically these lead-flow businesses will get ~$60-80 per lead.</p>
<p>Typically the breakdown is...</p>
<ul>
<li>2-4k equipment cost (pure hardware)</li>
<li>4-15k labor cost (removing old equipment, running refrigerant lines, install)</li>
<li>10-20k (maybe) duct upgrades, panel upgrades</li>
</ul>
<p>That labor cost has a wide variance. It's mostly a function of supply and demand. In areas where many people have AC, it's relatively easy to retrofit a heat pump and it happens all the time</p>
<p>Most of the time, heat pump upgrades will be done under <em>duress</em>. About 80% of furnace replacements happen during a "break-fix" scenario, where the existing equipment has stopped working and new equipment needs to be installed. It's much more difficult to ask for a bigger replacement (both in terms of time and cost) when the heating is out and your family is cold! Homeowners will call a <strong>contractor</strong> (also referred to as an HVAC technician) who comes in to investigate the issue.</p>
<p><strong>Contracting firms</strong> are typically both small and fragmented. There are <a href="https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes499021.htm">300,000 HVAC technicians in the US</a>, but <a href="https://www.ibisworld.com/industry-statistics/number-of-businesses/heating-air-conditioning-contractors-united-states/">145,000 companies</a>! That means many of them are either sole proprietors, or just a few individuals with a truck.</p>
<p>It's a good business to be in, generally speaking. Individual shops may be making anywhere from $500k to $10m per year depending on the size of operations. The <a href="https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes499021.htm">mean hourly wage for a technician is $26/hour</a>.</p>
<p>Most contractors that we've talked with indicate that there's a severe labor shortage. Contractors have to be experts at system design, understanding heating and cooling loads, some electrical work, pressure variations, and construction. It’s a skilled trade that takes a long time to master.</p>
<p>New contractors typically learn via the <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Mentor_teacher/Apprenticeship_model"><strong>apprenticeship model</strong></a>, but in the last few years, fewer individuals have entered these trades. In some cases, contractors aren't even taking new jobs for months. Demand for contractors spikes twice per year; the first hot day in summer, and the first cold day of the winter.</p>
<p>Over the last few years, there's been an increase in private equity roll-up vehicles buying up these firms. Many of them are trying to centralize and bring technology to key functions (scheduling, financing, invoicing) and allow the technicians to spend more time on their specialized work.</p>
<p>Contractors have not historically adopted a lot of software, though there are companies trying to serve them (<a href="https://www.servicetitan.com/">ServiceTitan</a>).</p>
<p>Finally there are the <strong>manufacturers</strong>. These are the only large players in the market, they are a handful of publicly traded companies, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier_Global">Carrier</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trane">Trane</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lennox">Lennox</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitsubishi_Group">Mitsubishi</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daikin">Daikin</a>. Each of them bring in <a href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001466258/45e3cbd7-53cc-416d-9ed7-6e84d9b7c7ce.pdf#page=3">$1b+ in hardware, and typically maintain a 20% margin</a>.</p>
<div><p><img src="https://calv.info/heat-pumps/trane-finances.png"></p><p><span>Trane's financials from their 10-K filing. 4.3b in revenue, 20% margin</span></p></div>
<p>Many technicians have agreements directly with wholesalers or the manufacturer. As a result, it's tough to buy a heat pump unit <em>even if you really wanted to</em>. Similar to the way car dealerships worked 20 years ago, you have to go through the dealer (aka the contractor or wholesaler) who is a licensed retailer for the manufacturer.</p>
<p>These manufacturers are slightly disincentivized from pushing heat pump adoption for two reasons: 1) many of them <em>also</em> sell furnaces and A/C units, and have whole divisions responsible for those P&amp;L statements 2) they want to maintain a margin on equipment. Rather than provide equipment that is higher-cost but easier to install, they will try and ship the lowest possible cost, and then pass the labor costs on to the end consumer.</p>
<p>There are <a href="https://www.eia.gov/consumption/residential/data/2020/hc/pdf/HC%202.1.pdf"><strong>77 million single-family homes in the US</strong></a>, and roughly <a href="https://rpsc.energy.gov/tech-solutions/hvac"><strong>3 million</strong> furnace or AC units installed per year</a>.</p>
<h2>Installing a heat pump</h2>
<p>Okay, so what's a heat pump install look like? There's a few different pieces..</p>
<p><strong>On-site visit</strong>: the purpose of this is two-fold. One part of it is to actually assess the quote and ensure that there aren't any issues. The second is to help sell the homeowner on the desired solution. As part of this on-site visit, the contractor will want to do some initial system sizing to determine what sort of system you need.</p>
<p>In repair cases, the first visit ends up being the most important. When a technician says that the existing equipment is and needs to be replaced, they set the framing for the entire journey.</p>
<p>The output of the system design should include a <strong>load sizing report for the home</strong>. It should indicate how many BTUs you need to heat your home in the winter, and how many tons of cooling you need in the summer.</p>
<p>As it turns out, load sizing is a surprisingly tricky problem to get right. Design will depend on your room configuration, insulation, and even position of the home relative to the sun. The “gold standard” way to do this is by running a <a href="https://www.acca.org/standards/technical-manuals/manual-j"><strong>Manual J calculation</strong></a> on the home, and doing a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blower_door"><strong>blower door test</strong></a> which assesses the actual leakiness of the home.</p>
<p>Many contractors will skip this step if replacing the existing equipment with a newer version of the same equipment. This is another reason that contractors will prefer to stick with replacing existing systems vs swapping out for a heat pump.</p>
<p>There's a few things that will blow up a quote...</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>new ductwork</strong> - if you live in a climate where it doesn't get too hot, you might have small ductwork. The ducts don't need to be very big because gas furnaces heat at a high temperature (140F). Heat pumps heat at a much lower temperature (100-110F), which means they need to move more volume of air to work. Getting to this increased volume requires increasing the duct size, which tends to add 10-20k to the up-front cost. In practice, if existing ductwork is insufficient, the installer will instead recommend a ductless system, which also tends to be more expensive (remember, if you have ducts, they are the cheapest way to deliver heat).</li>
<li><strong>panel upgrade / and new 240v outlets</strong> - older homes were wired in a time before we had all these electric appliances (solar panels, evs, etc). A heat pump might require upgrading your panel to accommodate increased amperage. Doing a panel upgrade isn't terribly expensive, but it might add 2-3k to rewire the home. It also increases the end-to-end time for the job, as the utility may have to upgrade service to the home.</li>
<li><strong>new insulation</strong> - insulating a home is expensive, but probably the thing you should do before making any other upgrades. in most cases, insulation will be the #1 thing you can do to make your home more efficient.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Install</strong>: a heat pump should be able to be installed in about a day. The technicians will have to remove any old units, and run any new refrigerant lines (aka drilling holes in the walls of your home). If you have an existing AC, the technicians can likely re-use the refrigerant lines already in your walls. The technicians will install the outdoor unit by placing it on a concrete slab and hooking it up to the electrical outlets, as well as the different indoor units. Often, technicians will recommend installing new thermostats as part of this process. Finally, they'll need to "charge" the refrigerants, filling the lines with R-410A (or another refrigerant).</p>
<p><strong>Follow-up / maintenance:</strong> most installers offer a 1-year warranty on any work that they do. Callbacks with heat pumps are most frequently due to leaking refrigerant (which also is bad from a climate-perspective, more on that below).</p>
<h2>Utilities</h2>
<p>There's one other player in this market who we didn't talk about yet: <strong>utilities</strong> and <strong>government funding</strong>.</p>
<p>The government has set aside budgets to help consumers drive the adoption of green technology. Typically these budgets are set at the federal level, and then flow down to the 'state energy office'. Each state energy office then works with local utilities (<a href="https://www.coned.com/en/">ConEd</a>, <a href="https://www.pge.com/">PG&amp;E</a>) or NGOs (<a href="https://www.bayren.org/">BayRen</a>) to provide programs for consumers to adopt high-efficiency devices.</p>
<p>While the large budget numbers are set at the federal level, actually dispersing that money is very much a local issue.</p>
<p>I've personally found the way utilities work to be a hard thing to reason about, but in general, here's how people have described their incentives to me...</p>
<ul>
<li>utilities charge each consumer a <strong>'fixed service fee</strong>' which is something like $20/mo. this costs them basically nothing to service (think of it like the gym membership)</li>
<li>utilities generally <strong>want to decrease peak demand</strong> on their systems, while simultaneously keeping customers connected and paying the service fee. the higher the demand, the more expensive it is for a utility to deliver that energy, so utilities will minimize spike and lower-margin "peak load"</li>
<li>utilities are <strong>'procurement engines',</strong> they are very good at funding new capital improvements, if they can show a return on those projects. they tend to build little in-house</li>
<li><strong>electric</strong> utilities will incentivize <strong>switching to all-electric</strong>. <strong>gas</strong> utilities will incentivize <strong>high-efficiency devices</strong>. in some cases, utilities which do both will figure out the cost to serve individual homes, and try and switch load to whatever method is cheapest to serve.</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite all this, the software and data utilities provide is an area that is ripe for startups to dig into. It's also a slog, the most well-known company here is <a href="https://www.oracle.com/industries/utilities/opower-energy-efficiency/">Opower</a>, but there aren't many others willing to brave the high-touch sales cycle.</p>
<h2>Incentives and rebates</h2>
<p>A key result of that government funding is that utilities often offer $2k-3k <em>per heat pump install</em> to bring higher-efficiency devices into the home. With the <a href="https://www.rewiringamerica.org/app/ira-calculator">Inflation Reduction Act this number has expanded dramatically for low and middle income families</a>.</p>
<p>There's a lot of problems that exist with these incentives...</p>
<p><strong>Discovery</strong> - before they can apply for incentives, homeowners have to know about them! The unfortunate thing is that these incentives are spread across many different sites. In many cases, incentives are "good until the money runs out", which means a consumer might be expecting <em>more</em> money back.</p>
<p><strong>Eligibility</strong> - woof, incentive eligibility is a complex thing. Often it depends on a multitude of factors: the exact unit which was installed, the sizing vs existing equipment, the household income, and more. It is difficult for homeowners and contractors alike to wade through to know how much money they are eligible for.</p>
<p><strong>Application</strong> - applying for rebates requires an annoying amount of paperwork. In cases of things like EV chargers, consumers can fill out the applications themselves. For a heat pump, it will probably require 2-3 hours of contractor time... which is why many contractors just don't bother!</p>
<p><strong>Financing</strong> - the biggest incentives have historically come in the form of tax credits that you can claim off your tax bill at the end of the year. This means that the consumer has to 'float' the cost of the install up-front, until they can claim the rebate months later. More progressive utilities will partner with banks to <a href="https://www.velocitycu.com/loans/austin-energy/">provide interest-free loans</a>, but there's still a big gap here.</p>
<h2>Heat pump economics (am I getting ripped off?)</h2>
<p>You might be wondering how money flows as part of this process...</p>
<ul>
<li>the <strong>wholesalers</strong> will typically charge <strong>3-5k</strong> per heat pump unit. Higher efficiency units will be more expensive (<strong>6-8k</strong>). The manufacturer will try and maintain a <strong>30% margin</strong>, with higher-efficiency units having a greater margin.</li>
<li>the <strong>installers</strong> will pass that cost onto the consumer, and then typically <em>double the cost of the unit for labor</em>. For a 5k system, there will be minimum 5k in labor costs. In certain geos with a more competitive labor market (SF, Seattle), we've even seen labor account for <strong>70-90% of the bill</strong>.</li>
<li>the average consumer with a high-efficiency gas furnace will save something like <strong>~$200/year on fuel costs</strong>. the consumers using more expensive forms of energy (e.g. fuel oil) will save closer to <strong>$2,000 per year</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>contractors</strong> will usually include some buffer room</li>
</ul>
<p>The net-result is that <strong>in a heat-pump popular market with many AC units</strong> and mild climate (think Austin, TX), the cost will be something like <strong>$8-10k to switch to a heat pump</strong>. In a market where AC usage is much rarer (SF), or the climate is more extreme (e.g. Seattle, Boston), <strong>a heat pump install might run you $20k.</strong></p>
<h2>A word on Refrigerants</h2>
<p>While I'm generally bullish on heat pumps and convinced that we must adopt them to prevent climate change, today's heat pumps aren't <em>all</em> sunshine and rainbows. There's one big problem with rolling them out: <strong>refrigerants</strong>.</p>
<p>Remember, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refrigerant">refrigerants are substances which transfer heat from outside in (or vice versa)</a>. Refrigerants have a very low boiling point (think -40 degrees F). The low boiling point makes it easy to change the pressure to adjust whether a refrigerant is liquid or gas, which is good for heating transfer, but can create problems elsewhere.</p>
<p>Notably, many refrigerants have a high<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming_potential"> <strong>global-warming-potential</strong> (GWP)</a>. This number is measured relative to CO2 (which has a GWP of 1), and expresses how much worse a molecule of refrigerant is when it comes to global warming.</p>
<p>There have been thousands of refrigerants categorized over time. They are typically numbered by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_refrigerants">R-{Ccount - 1}{Hcount + 1}{Fcount}</a> when viewed as pure chains, but when they are combined the numbering scheme changes to be more sequential.</p>
<p>Today's most popular refrigerant is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-410A">R-410A</a>. It is a mixture of CHF<sub>2</sub>CF<sub>3</sub> and CH<sub>2</sub>F<sub>2</sub> has a GWP of 1,400. (It should be noted that even with some refrigerant leakage, <a href="https://heatpumpshooray.com/">we still see that heat pumps come out ahead when it comes to GWP</a>)</p>
<p>Over time, we've been steadily outlawing high global-warming-potential refrigerants (remember CFCs and HFCs?). <a href="https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/us-will-dramatically-cut-climate-damaging-greenhouse-gases-new-program-aimed-chemicals">And in 2024, the industry is gearing up to phase out R-410A</a>.</p>
<p>The one problem is that there aren't a lot of other <em>good</em> alternatives that exist. Refrigerants fall into two classes...</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>flammable</strong>: these are refrigerants like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propane_refrigeration">Propane (R-290)</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isobutane">Isobutane</a>. We can't roll them out without updating a bunch of building codes. <em>As an aside, it's sort of crazy to me that we decide to limit propane in building codes, when we pipe natural gas into homes all the time to literally light it on fire.</em></li>
<li><strong>high-pressure</strong>: among the leading non-flammable refrigerants is <a href="https://www.danfoss.com/en/about-danfoss/our-businesses/cooling/refrigerants-and-energy-efficiency/refrigerants-for-lowering-the-gwp/carbon-dioxide-co2/">CO2</a>. It's not flammable (good!) has a GWP of 1 (also good!) but requires a <em>lot</em> more pressure to turn from vapor to liquid (bad!). This means more expensive compressors.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finding new refrigerants is an active area of research, and will probably require a sea change. Most of the big manufacturers seem to be heavily investigating this area of research.</p>
<h2>Buckets of problems</h2>
<p><strong>Consumer awareness</strong> - most consumers don't know (or care much) about how they get their heat. Despite being available for many years, heat pumps have only recently entered the popular discourse. Unlike solar or EVs, heat pumps are pretty much invisible, and it's not yet a status symbol in any dimension.</p>
<p><strong>Urgency of problem</strong> - most HVAC systems are replaced when the old system has broken. Consumers typically don't have a ton of appetite to do a lengthy heat pump install when they can't keep their home warm! On the flip side, when an HVAC system is working smoothly, consumers have little desire to switch it out and add risk to the process.</p>
<p><strong>Contractor incentives</strong> - contractors typically want to avoid any sort of callback. The easiest way to do this is to replace the existing equipment. It minimizes risk, and additional labor hours. You don't have to worry about running into issues which might lead to a drastically higher quote (duct sizing or panel upgrades).</p>
<p><strong>Regional markets</strong> - one reason HVAC is tricky for startups to tackle is that it's a highly fragmented, very regional market. The pitch for consumers is actually different depending on geo. In SF or Seattle, heat pumps might be viewed as 'adding an AC for the first time'. In the southeast, it's a way of reducing your electricity bill by 2-3x. In the northeast, heat pumps are best positioned to replace expensive sources of fuel like fuel oil.</p>
<h2>Areas of opportunity</h2>
<p><strong>Financing</strong>. Solar has a rich set of options for financing the big up-front cost. These largely do not exist with heat pumps today (though local utilities may sometimes run 0% APR loan programs). Applying for rebates and incentives is an arduous process, and often <em>still</em> requires that you spend money up-front.</p>
<p><strong>System design</strong>. Designing a system for a home is tricky, and often involves a visit to the home. This is both annoying for consumers, and costs the contractor as it requires an extra 2-3h of transit time to prepare a quote that they may not even be paid for! The holy grail here would be working in the same way that solar does: going directly from address -&gt; design. We've built a lot of this modeling into <a href="http://heatpumpshooray.com/">Heat Pumps, Hooray!</a>, but there's still internals of the system which require more work to surface (ductwork, panel, refrigerant lines). There are some companies focused exclusively on system design (<a href="https://www.coolcalc.com/">CoolCalc</a>, <a href="https://www.getarch.com/">Arch</a>, <a href="https://www.getconduit.com/">Conduit</a>).</p>
<p><strong>New heat pumps and refrigerants</strong>. There's a number of startups trying to build new heat pumps: <a href="https://www.gradientcomfort.com/">Gradient</a>, <a href="https://stow.energy/">Stow</a>, <a href="https://dandelionenergy.com/">Dandelion Energy</a>, and others. A system like Gradient's window unit doesn't require any sort of contractor install and works for multi-family apartment buildings. Dandelion takes a differentiated approach by focusing on ground-source heat pumps, which are more difficult to purchase.</p>
<p><strong>Purchase journey.</strong> Right now, it's fairly difficult to get a heat pump even if you are highly motivated and not budget constrained. There's a number of companies trying to help the purchase journey: <a href="https://www.woltair.com/">Woltair</a> in Poland, <a href="https://lun.energy/">Lun</a> in the EU. Each of them are working to make buying a heat pump more similar to buying a dishwasher or washer/dryer online.</p>
<p>Additionally there are some other pathways that folks are trying to explore that I'm a little less bullish on, but I thought are worth mentioning here.</p>
<p><strong>Luxury products?</strong> A number of folks are investigating whether heat pumps might become a luxury product. I'm personally skeptical here. Heating and cooling are a lot less tangible than an EV or having solar on your roof. That said, if you could find a way to turn a heat pump into a futuristic technological device or a high-status symbol, I think you'd have a lot of luck. <a href="https://www.quilt.com/">Quilt</a> is one such company, applying high industrial design to an antiquated market. For products like an induction stove where you use it daily, I think this approach can work much better (a la <a href="https://www.impulselabs.com/">Impulse</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Whole-home electrification</strong>. It's far more common to upgrade a single component at a time. But there are a few companies trying to do whole-home electrification by providing better hardware and software: <a href="https://www.lunarenergy.com/">Lunar Energy</a>, <a href="https://www.elephantenergy.org/">Elephant Energy</a>.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p>Happy New Year everyone! In late December 2023 (Christmas Day to be precise), CPython core developer <a href="https://github.com/brandtbucher">Brandt Bucher</a> submitted a <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/113465">little pull-request to the Python 3.13</a> branch adding a JIT compiler.</p>
<p>This change, once accepted would be one of the biggest changes to the CPython Interpreter since the Specializing Adaptive Interpreter added in Python 3.11 (which was also from Brandt).</p>
<p>In this blog post, we’re going to have a look at this JIT, what it is, how it works and what the benefits are.</p>
<h2>What is a JIT?</h2>
<p>JIT, or “Just in Time” is a compilation design that implies that compilation happens on demand when the code is run the first time. It’s a very broad term that could mean many things. I guess, technically the Python compiler is already a JIT because it compiles from Python code into Bytecode.</p>
<p>What people <em>tend</em> to mean when they say a JIT compiler, is a compiler that emits <strong>machine code</strong>. This is in contrast to an AOT (Ahead of Time) compiler, like the GNU C compiler, GCC or the Rust compiler rustc which generates the machine code once and distributes as a binary executable.</p>
<p>When you run Python code, it is first compiled into bytecodes. There are plenty of talks and videos about this process online so I don’t want to rehash this too much, but what is important to note about Python bytecodes is:</p>
<ol>
<li>They mean nothing to the CPU and require a special bytecode interpreter loop to execute</li>
<li>They are high level and can equate to 1000’s of machine instructions</li>
<li>They are type agnostic</li>
<li>They are cross-platform</li>
</ol>
<p>For a very simple Python function <code>f()</code> that defines a variable <code>a</code> and assigns the value <code>1</code>:</p>
<pre><code>def func():
    a = 1
    return a
</code></pre>

<p>It compiles to 5 bytecode instructions, which you can see by running <code>dis.dis</code>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import dis
&gt;&gt;&gt; dis.dis(f)
 34           0 RESUME                   0

 35           2 LOAD_CONST               1 (1)
              4 STORE_FAST               0 (a)

 36           6 LOAD_FAST                0 (a)
              8 RETURN_VALUE
</code></pre>

<p>I have a more interactive disassembler called <a href="https://github.com/tonybaloney/dissy">dissy</a> as well if you want to try something more complicated.</p>
<p>For this function, Python 3.11 compiled into the instructions <code>LOAD_CONST</code>, <code>STORE_FAST</code>, <code>LOAD_CONST</code>, and <code>RETURN_VALUE</code>. These instructions are interpreted when the function is run by a massive loop written in C.</p>
<p>If you were to write a very crude Python evaluation loop in Python equivalent to the one in C, it would look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>import dis

def interpret(func):
    stack = []
    variables = {}
    for instruction in dis.get_instructions(func):
        if instruction.opname == "LOAD_CONST":
            stack.append(instruction.argval)
        elif instruction.opname == "LOAD_FAST":
            stack.append(variables[instruction.argval])
        elif instruction.opname == "STORE_FAST":
            variables[instruction.argval] = stack.pop()
        elif instruction.opname == "RETURN_VALUE":
            return stack.pop()


def func():
    a = 1
    return a
</code></pre>

<p>If you gave this interpreter our test function, it would execute them and print the results:</p>
<pre><code>print(interpret(func))
</code></pre>

<p>This loop with a big switch/if-else statement is an equivalent, albeit simplified version of how CPython’s interpreter loop works. CPython is written in C and compiled by a C compiler. For the sake of simplicity I’ll build out this example in Python.</p>
<p>For our interpreter, everytime you want to run the function, <code>func</code> it has to loop through each instruction and compare the bytecode name (called the opcode) with each if-statement. Both this comparison and the loop itself add an overhead to the execution. That overhead seems redundant if you run the function 10,000 times and the bytecodes never change (because they are immutable). It would be more efficient to instead generate the code in a sequence instead of a evaluating this loop every time you call the function.</p>
<p>This is what a JIT does. There are many types of JIT compiler. Numba is a JIT. PyPy has a JIT. Java has lots of JITs. Pyston and Pyjion are JITs.</p>
<p>The JIT that is proposed for Python 3.13 is a copy-any-patch JIT.</p>
<h2>What is a copy-and-patch JIT?</h2>
<p>Never heard of a copy-and-patch JIT? Don’t worry, nor had I and nor have most people. It’s an idea <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3485513">only proposed recently in 2021</a> and designed as a fast algorithm for dynamic language runtimes.</p>
<p>I’ll try and explain what a copy-and-patch JIT is by expanding our interpreter loop and rewriting it as a JIT. Before, the interpreter loop did two things, first it interpreted (looked at the bytecode) then it executed (ran the instruction). What we can do instead is to seperate those tasks and have the interpreter output the instructions and not execute them.</p>
<p>A <strong>copy-and-patch</strong> JIT is the idea that you <strong>copy</strong> the instructions for each command and fill-in-the-blanks for that bytecode arguments (or <strong>patch</strong>). Here’s a rewritten example, I keep the loop very similar but each time I append a code string with the Python code to execute:</p>
<pre><code>def copy_and_patch_interpret(func):
    code = 'def f():\n'
    code += '  stack = []\n'
    code += '  variables = {}\n'
    for instruction in dis.get_instructions(func):
        if instruction.opname == "LOAD_CONST":
            code += f'  stack.append({instruction.argval})\n'
        elif instruction.opname == "LOAD_FAST":
            code += f'  stack.append(variables["{instruction.argval}"])\n'
        elif instruction.opname == "STORE_FAST":
            code += f'  variables["{instruction.argval}"] = stack.pop()\n'
        elif instruction.opname == "RETURN_VALUE":
            code += '  return stack.pop()\n'
    code += 'f()'
    return code
</code></pre>

<p>This result for the original function is:</p>
<pre><code>def f():
  stack = []
  variables = {}
  stack.append(1)
  variables["a"] = stack.pop()
  stack.append(None)
  return stack.pop()
f()
</code></pre>

<p>This time, the code is <strong>sequential</strong> and doesn’t require the loop to execute. We can store the resulting string and run it as many times as we like:</p>
<pre><code>compiled_function = compile(copy_and_patch_interpret(func), filename="&lt;string&gt;", mode="exec")

print(exec(compiled_function))
print(exec(compiled_function))
print(exec(compiled_function))
</code></pre>

<p>What was the point in that? Well the resulting code does the same thing, but it should run faster. I gave the two implementations to <a href="https://pypi.org/project/richbench/">rich bench</a> and the copy-and-patch method runs faster <em>(Keep in mind though that loops in Python are very slow compared to C.)</em></p>
<h2>Why a copy-and-patch JIT?</h2>
<p>This technique of writing out the instructions for each bytecode and patching the values has upsides and downsides compared to a “full” JIT compiler. A full JIT compiler would normally compile high-level bytecodes like <code>LOAD_FAST</code> into lower level instructions in an IL (Intermediate Language). Because every CPU architecture has different instructions and features, it would be monumentally-complicated to write a compiler that converts high-level code directly to machine code and supports 32-bit and 64-bit CPUs, as well as Apple’s ARM architecture as well as all the other flavours of ARM. Instead most JIT’s compile first to an IL that is a generic machine-code-like instruction set. Those instructions are things like “PUSH A 64-bit integer”, “POP a 64-bit float”, “MULTIPLY the values on the stack”. The JIT can then compile IL into machine-code at runtime by emitting CPU-specific instructions and storing them in memory to be later executed (similar to how we did in our example).</p>
<p>Once you have IL, you can run all sorts of fun optimizations on the code like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant_folding">constant propagation</a> and loop hoisting. You can see an example of this in <a href="https://live.trypyjion.com/">Pyjion’s live compiler UI</a>.</p>
<p>The big downside with a “full” JIT is that the process of compiling once into IL and then again into machine code is <strong>slow</strong>. Not only is it slow, but it is memory intensive. To illustrate this, data from recent research <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/spe.3267">“Python meets JIT compilers: A simple implementation and a comparative evaluation”</a> showed that Java-based JITs for Python like GraalPy, and Jython can take up to 100 times longer to start than normal CPython and consume up to an additional Gigabyte of RAM to compile. There are already full JIT implementations for Python.</p>
<p>Copy-and-patch was selected because the compilation from bytecodes to machine code is done as a set of “templates” that are then stitched together and patched at runtime with the correct values. This means that your average Python user isn’t running this complex JIT compiler architecture inside their Python runtime. Python writing it’s own IL and JIT would also be unreasonable since so many are available off-the-shelf like LLVMs and ryuJIT. But a full-JIT would require those being bundled with Python and all the added overheads. A copy-and-patch JIT only requires the LLVM JIT tools be installed on the machine where CPython is compiled from source, and for most people that means the machines of the CI that builds and packages CPython for python.org.</p>
<h2>So how does this JIT work?</h2>
<p>The copy-and-patch compiler for Python works by extending some new (and honestly not widely known about) APIs to Python 3.13’s API. These changes enable pluggable optimizers to be discoverable at runtime in CPython and control how code is executed. This new JIT is an optional optimizer for this new architecture. I assume that it will be the default in future versions once the major bugs have been squashed. </p>
<p>When you compile CPython from source, you can provide a flag <code>--enable-experimental-jit</code> to the configure script. This will generate machine-code templates for the Python bytecodes. This happens by first copying the C code for each bytecode, for example for LOAD_CONST, the simplest:</p>
<pre><code>frame-&gt;instr_ptr = next_instr;
next_instr += 1;
INSTRUCTION_STATS(LOAD_CONST); // Not used unless compiled with instrumentation
PyObject *value;
value = GETITEM(FRAME_CO_CONSTS, oparg);
Py_INCREF(value);
stack_pointer[0] = value;
stack_pointer += 1;
DISPATCH();
</code></pre>

<p>The instructions for this bytecode are first compiled by the C compiled into a little shared library and then stored as machine code. Because there are some variables normally determined at runtime, like <code>oparg</code>, the C code is compiled with those parameters left as <code>0</code>. There is then a list of the 0 values that need to be filled in, called holes. For <code>LOAD_CONST</code>, there are 2 holes to be filled , the oparg and the next instruction:</p>
<pre><code>static const Hole _LOAD_CONST_code_holes[3] = {
    {0xd, HoleKind_X86_64_RELOC_UNSIGNED, HoleValue_OPARG, NULL, 0x0},
    {0x46, HoleKind_X86_64_RELOC_UNSIGNED, HoleValue_CONTINUE, NULL, 0x0},
};
</code></pre>

<p>All of the machine code is then stored as a sequence of bytes in the file <code>jit_stencil.h</code> which is automatically generated by a new build stage. The disassembled code is stored as a comment above each bytecode template, where <code>JIT_OPARG</code> and <code>JIT_CONTINUE</code> are the holes to be filled:</p>
<pre><code>0000000000000000 &lt;__JIT_ENTRY&gt;:
pushq   %rbp
movq    %rsp, %rbp
movq    (%rdi), %rax
movq    0x28(%rax), %rax
movabsq $0x0, %rcx
000000000000000d:  X86_64_RELOC_UNSIGNED        __JIT_OPARG
movzwl  %cx, %ecx
movq    0x28(%rax,%rcx,8), %rax
movl    0xc(%rax), %ecx
incl    %ecx
je      0x3d &lt;__JIT_ENTRY+0x3d&gt;
movq    %gs:0x0, %r8
cmpq    (%rax), %r8
jne     0x37 &lt;__JIT_ENTRY+0x37&gt;
movl    %ecx, 0xc(%rax)
jmp     0x3d &lt;__JIT_ENTRY+0x3d&gt;
lock
addq    $0x4, 0x10(%rax)
movq    %rax, (%rsi)
addq    $0x8, %rsi
movabsq $0x0, %rax
0000000000000046:  X86_64_RELOC_UNSIGNED        __JIT_CONTINUE
popq    %rbp
jmpq    *%rax
</code></pre>

<p>The new JIT compiler, will when activated copy the machine-code instructions for each bytecode into a sequence and replace the values for each template with the arguments for that bytecode in the code object. The resulting machine code is stored in memory and then each time the Python function is run, that machine-code is executed directly.</p>
<p>You can see the JITted code if you compile <a href="https://github.com/brandtbucher/cpython/pull/32">my branch</a> and try it on this <a href="https://gist.github.com/tonybaloney/7e12e416ad69968e297547498f7bcde1">test script</a> then give it to a disassembler like Ada Pro or Hopper. At the moment,  the JIT is only used if the function contains the <code>JUMP_BACKWARD</code> opcode which is used in the <code>while</code> statement but that will change in the future.</p>
<h2>Is it faster?</h2>
<p>The initial benchmarks show something of <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/113465#issuecomment-1876225775">a 2-9% performance improvement</a>. You might be disappointed by this number, especially since this blog post has been talking about assembly and machine code and nothing is faster than that right? Well, remember that CPython is already written in C and that was already compiled to machine-code by the C compiler. In most cases, this JIT will be executing almost the same machine-code instructions as it was before.</p>
<p><strong>However</strong>, think of this JIT as being the cornerstone of a series of much larger optimizations. None of which are possible without it. For this change to be accepted, understood and maintained in an open-source project it needs to start simple.</p>
<h2>The future is bright, the future is JIT compiled</h2>
<p>The challenges with the existing interpreter being compiled ahead-of-time are that there are fewer opportunities for serious optimizations. Python 3.11’s adaptive interpreter was a step in the right direction, but it needs to go a lot further for Python to see a step-change in performance. </p>
<p>I think that whilst the first version of this JIT isn’t going to seriously dent any benchmarks (yet), it opens the door to some huge optimizations and not just ones that benefit the toy benchmark programs in the standard benchmark suite. </p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>   

<p>It’s Tuesday morning. The year is 2009. You’re just waking up after a long and boozy New Year’s Eve with friends. Your head rings, and your mouth is the type of dry that makes you question your adulthood. You feel something scratch against your arm. Did you take a lover last night? Sort of. It’s a pizza box. Meat lovers.</p>
<p>You reach for your phone. There’s no TikTok or Snapchat yet. Facebook and Instagram are a thing, but they exist as a type of social syndicator— a place to see what your friends were up to last night. You already know as much. The occasional whiff of rank vodka keeps your memory jogged. You tap the browser icon and start typing a web￼ address, perhaps appending <code>www</code> as a precautionary ￼relic. <em>Who got drunker than me</em>, you wonder. After a brief page load, you arrive at textsfromlastnight.com. “<em>I cant get the smell of ass out of my nose</em>,” reads the top post.</p>
<p>You scroll, pausing only for the occasional forward to your best friend, who undoubtedly hurts as much as you. You both laugh at the crass misfortunes of others and quietly hope you hadn’t somehow made it onto the front page yourself.</p>
<p>You copy the link to the best of the bunch, the story that made you laugh the hardest, and post it to your Facebook.</p>
<h2 id="for-you-but-not-by-us" tabindex="-1">For you, but not by us. <a href="#for-you-but-not-by-us">#</a></h2>
<p>For better or worse, the web doesn’t work like that anymore. No one clicks a webpage hoping to learn which cat <em>can haz cheeseburger</em>. Weirdos, maybe. <em>Sickos</em>.</p>
<p>No, we get our content from a For You Page now— algorithmically selected videos and images made by our favorite creators, produced explicitly for our preferred platform. Which platform doesn’t matter much. So long as it’s one of the big five. Creators churn out content for all of them.</p>
<p>It’s a technical marvel, that internet. Something so mindblowingly impressive that if you showed it to someone even thirty years ago, their face would melt the fuck off. So why does it feel like something’s missing? Why are we all so collectively unhappy with the state of the web?</p>
<h2 id="where-did-all-the-websites-go" tabindex="-1">Where <em>did</em> all the websites go? <a href="#where-did-all-the-websites-go">#</a></h2>
<p>A tweet went viral this Thanksgiving when a Twitter user posed a question to their followers. A peek at the comments, and I could only assume the tweet struck a nerve. It certainly did with me. It's why I wrote this piece.</p>
<p><img src="https://fromjason.xyz/img/image-wheredidallthewebsitesgo.jpg" alt="tweet"></p>
<p>Everyone had their own answer. Some comments blamed the app-ification of the web. "<em>Everything is an app now!</em>," one user replied. Others point to the death of Adobe Flash and how so many sites and games died along with it. Everyone agrees that websites have indeed vanished, and we all miss the days we were free to visit them.</p>
<p>I have good news and bad news.</p>
<p>The good news is that websites didn’t go anywhere. There are currently one billion websites on the World Wide Web. Here’s a few from my bookmarks that are <em>amazing</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://anthonybourdain.tumblr.com/">Anthony Bourdain’s Tumblr</a></li>
<li><a href="https://yesterweb.org/">Yesterweb.org</a></li>

<li><a href="https://cari.institute/aesthetics">CARI Aesthetics</a></li>
<li><a href="https://potato.cheap/">The Cheap Web</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Cool, right? So here’s the bad news— <em>we</em> are the ones who vanished, and I suspect what we really miss are the joys of discovery.</p>
<h2 id="we-miss-curation" tabindex="-1">We miss curation <a href="#we-miss-curation">#</a></h2>
<p>We used to know how to do this. Not long ago, we were good at separating the signal from noise. Granted, there’s a lot more noise these days, but most of it comes from and is encouraged by the silos we dwell in.</p>
<p>Somewhere between the late 2000’s aggregator sites and the contemporary For You Page, we lost our ability to <em>curate</em> the web. Worse still, we’ve outsourced our discovery to corporate algorithms. Most of us did it in exchange for an endless content feed. By most, I mean upwards of 90% who don’t make content on a platform as understood by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule">90/9/1 rule</a>. And that’s okay! Or, at least, it makes total sense to me. Who wouldn’t want a steady stream of dopamine shots?</p>
<p>The rest of us, <a href="https://www.fromjason.xyz/p/notebook/how-do-we-stop-meta-in-2024-we-fix-the-information-loop/">posters, amplifiers, and aggregators</a>, traded our discovery autonomy for a chance at fame and fortune. Not all, but enough to change the social web landscape.</p>
<p>But that gold at the end of the rainbow isn’t for us. “Creator funds” pull from a fixed pot. It’s a line item in a budget that doesn’t change, whether one hundred or one million hands dip inside it. Executives in polished cement floor offices, who you’ll never meet, <em>choose</em> their winners and losers. And I’m guessing it’s not a meritocracy-based system. They pick their tokens, round up their shills, and stuff Apple Watch ads between them.</p>
<p>So when we wonder where all the websites have gone, know it’s the <em>curators</em> we’re nostalgic for because the curators showed us the best the web had to offer once upon a time. And the curators— the tenders, aggregators, collectors, and connectors— can bring us back to something better. Because it’s still out there, we just have to find it.</p>
<p>Here’s the best part. You can be that curator right now, at this very moment. You can start to rebuild the interconnectivity that made the web fun to explore. And you don’t need to be a computer scientist to do it.</p>
<p>Open a Linktree account or whatever. And instead of adding your other social media accounts, add three links to your favorite blog posts. Or, add links to a few artists with their own sites. Or your favorite aggregator sites. It doesn’t matter what you include, so long as we make portals to other digital green spaces that exist outside of Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Then, throw that list into your link-in-bio</strong>. I just <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jasondotgov/">swapped my IG link</a> from my home page to a post listing my favorite blogging platforms. Most, if not all, are from “indie” developers. And who knows, maybe someone clicks on it and the web gains a new writer. How cool would that be?</p>
<p>So what do ya say? Let's make a bunch of open web <em>portals</em> for 2024! I guess I set this up for a two-parter, haven’t I? I’ll see you at the next post.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>We introduce Mixtral 8x7B, a Sparse Mixture of Experts (SMoE) language model. Mixtral has the same architecture as Mistral 7B, with the difference that each layer is composed of 8 feedforward blocks (i.e. experts). For every token, at each layer, a router network selects two experts to process the current state and combine their outputs. Even though each token only sees two experts, the selected experts can be different at each timestep. As a result, each token has access to 47B parameters, but only uses 13B active parameters during inference. Mixtral was trained with a context size of 32k tokens and it outperforms or matches Llama 2 70B and GPT-3.5 across all evaluated benchmarks. In particular, Mixtral vastly outperforms Llama 2 70B on mathematics, code generation, and multilingual benchmarks. We also provide a model fine-tuned to follow instructions, Mixtral 8x7B - Instruct, that surpasses GPT-3.5 Turbo, Claude-2.1, Gemini Pro, and Llama 2 70B - chat model on human benchmarks. Both the base and instruct models are released under the Apache 2.0 license.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
<p>Are you <em>sure</em> holding it to your head really makes it better? Your experiment is very poorly designed because you have only sampled instances where the remote wasn't working when your head wasn't in the picture. This is blatant <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_bias" rel="nofollow noreferrer">selection bias</a>.</p>

<p>No doubt, putting the remote near your head (or anything else conductive) will significantly <em>alter</em> the electromagnetic radiations of the remote. But is it <em>better</em>, or just <em>different</em>? If it wasn't working to start, then you changed something, then it worked, that doesn't mean it's better. You need to also try holding it to your head, then find instances where that doesn't work, then try using the remote normally.</p>

<p>It's a common flaw in human reasoning at work here. People like to attribute success in some random or complex process to some ritual (in this case, putting the remote on your head) rather than simply realizing the success was due to an unrelated perturbation of the system, or simply another trial. Here's a familiar (at least, to people of the right age) instance of this flaw:</p>

<p><a href="http://xkcd.com/218/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Voo3d.png" alt="XKCD comic"></a></p>

<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_System" rel="nofollow noreferrer">NES</a> had game cartridges that were notoriously unreliable. The culprit was a cheaply designed electrical contact. Child wisdom had it that taking the cartridge out, vigorously blowing into the cartridge, and putting it back in would fix it. Each clan of children probably had some variation on this ritual, with important details, such as pushing the cartridge up and down a couple times, shaking the cartridge, leaving the door open, pressing the reset button multiple times, and so on. In reality, removing and re-inserting the cartridge and rebooting the NES just introduced another trial, and eventually it worked. The rest is insignificant ritual and superstition. (But don't tell any kids from the 80's that -- they won't believe you!)</p>

<p>That's not to say it's not <em>possible</em> your head does improve the remote's range. Indeed, your head will be inductively and capacitively coupled to the antenna. Significant RF currents will exist in your head, and some of this energy will be radiated, and your head will radiate differently than the antenna in the remote.</p>

<p>Perhaps, by virtue of your head's increased size, it makes a more efficient antenna. It's also possible, by virtue of your head's lower conductivity compared to copper, that it's a <em>less</em> effective antenna. It's also possible your head will act as a reflector, directing more of the radio's energy at the car. It's also possible your head will refract the waves away from the car.</p>

<p>The point is <em>we don't know</em>. All the research I've done turns up anecdotal evidence at best, by people who are not RF engineers performing similarly poorly designed experiments, or people who have talked to "an expert". I've never seen data collected by a qualified engineer with proper test equipment.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p id="e784">For those interested, let me provide more context below.</p><figure><figcaption><em>Liquidity has been a problem I wanted to solve for almost a decade. From our </em><a href="https://carta.com/blog/carta-series-a/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Series A deck</em></a><em> back in 2014.</em></figcaption></figure><p id="c81e"><strong>Nasdaq for Private Markets?</strong></p><p id="0306">We started eShares 10 years ago as the “Nasdaq for Private Markets” (we were not “the captable company”) because I wanted to solve the liquidity problem for founders, employees, and angel investors. The percentage of startups that get to IPO is so small that 99% of founders never receive liquidity and spend a decade or more paper rich but cash poor. That seemed a problem worth solving.</p><p id="9853">Fast forward to today, our business is broken down as follows: the captable business is about $250M/year, fund administration is about $100M, private equity is about $20M, and the secondary trading business is about $3M. We have done a decent job at building the captable business, an ok job at fund admin (but feeling the growing pains), and an abysmal job at the secondary business.</p><p id="03c1">It is my greatest failure and disappointment. Some of my other ideas have worked — like captables, 409As, fund administration, private equity. But ALL of my ideas around liquidity — auctions, investor matching, secondary trading, open tender offers, have not worked. I might not be the entrepreneur that can solve this problem.</p><p id="bf4c"><strong>Because We Have the Data, We Can’t Use It</strong></p><p id="4f4c">But I am learning something else — Carta might not be <em>the company</em> that can solve this problem. Many people think we are best poised to solve liquidity because we have captable data. But that same argument is used for data products. People say “You have all the data so you should put Pitchbook out of business!” But it is precisely <em>because </em>we have the data, that we can’t use it. It is our customers’ data, not ours. That’s why in ten years Carta has never released a data product. I use Pitchbook and Techcrunch when I research a company before I meet the CEO.</p><p id="efbe">Having ground truth data is not an advantage if we can’t use it. And it is a disadvantage if people think we use it. For example, if we send emails to prospects through publicly available information, how do customers know if we sourced it publicly or internally? Will they believe us if we tell them? And does it matter?

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>GTA Online. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gtaonline/comments/9vgo0g/how_the_fuck_are_20_minute_load_times_acceptable/">Infamous</a> for its slow loading times. Having picked up the game again to finish some of the newer heists I was <em>shocked</em> (/s) to discover that it still loads just as slow as the day it was released 7 years ago.</p>
<p>It was time. Time to get to the bottom of this.</p>
<h2 id="Recon"><a href="#Recon" title="Recon"></a>Recon</h2><p>First I wanted to check if someone had already solved this problem. Most of the results I found pointed towards anecdata about <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://metro.co.uk/2017/11/01/why-does-gta-v-take-so-long-to-load-7041927/">how the game is so sophisticated</a> that it needs to load so long, stories on how the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/271590/discussions/0/217690940938819317/">p2p network architecture</a> is rubbish (not saying that it isn’t), some elaborate ways of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://gtaforums.com/topic/908000-fastest-way-to-load-into-gtao-single-player-first-or-straight-in/">loading into story mode and a solo session after that</a> and a couple of mods that allowed skipping the startup R* logo video. Some more reading told me we could save a whopping 10-30 seconds with these combined!</p>
<p>Meanwhile on my PC…</p>
<h2 id="Benchmark"><a href="#Benchmark" title="Benchmark"></a>Benchmark</h2><figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br><span>3</span><br><span>4</span><br><span>5</span><br><span>6</span><br><span>7</span><br><span>8</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>Story mode load time:  ~1m 10s</span><br><span>Online mode load time: ~6m flat</span><br><span>Startup menu disabled, time from R* logo until in-game (social club login time isn't counted).</span><br><span></span><br><span>Old but decent CPU:   AMD FX-8350</span><br><span>Cheap-o SSD:          KINGSTON SA400S37120G</span><br><span>We have to have RAM:  2x Kingston 8192 MB (DDR3-1337) 99U5471</span><br><span>Good-ish GPU:         NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p>I know my setup is dated but what on <em>earth</em> could take 6x longer to load into online mode? I couldn’t measure any difference using the story-to-online loading technique <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gtaonline/comments/kycy7a/gtao_loading_times_using_different_methods/">as others have found before me</a>. Even if it did work the results would be down in the noise.</p>
<h2 id="I-Am-Not-Alone"><a href="#I-Am-Not-Alone" title="I Am (Not) Alone"></a>I Am (Not) Alone</h2><p>If <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gtaonline/comments/ht4i56/your_average_online_loading_time/">this poll</a> is to be trusted then the issue is widespread enough to mildly annoy more than 80% of the player base. It’s been 7 years R*!</p>
<p><img src="https://nee.lv/images/pasted-0.png" alt="🎵What does the poll say?🎵"></p>
<p>Looking around a bit to find who are the lucky ~20% that get sub 3 minute load times I came across <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdCqDdjp6iU">a</a> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJzr3qfyCyg">few</a> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK7BUFx_NGk">benchmarks</a> with high-end gaming PCs and an online mode load time of about 2 minutes. I would <del>kill</del> <em>hack</em> for a 2 minute load time! It does seem to be hardware-dependent but something doesn’t add up here…</p>
<p>How come their story mode still takes near a minute to load? (The M.2 one didn’t count the startup logos btw.) Also, loading story to online takes them only a minute more while I’m getting about five more. I know that their hardware specs are a lot better but surely not 5x better.</p>
<h2 id="Highly-accurate-measurements"><a href="#Highly-accurate-measurements" title="Highly accurate measurements"></a>Highly accurate measurements</h2><p>Armed with such powerful tools as <em>the Task Manager</em> I began to investigate what resources could be the bottleneck.</p>
<p><img src="https://nee.lv/images/pasted-1.png" alt="Can you smell it?"></p>
<p>After taking a minute to load the common resources used for both story and online modes (which is near on par with high-end PCs) GTA decides to max out a single core on my machine for four minutes and do nothing else.</p>
<p>Disk usage? None! Network usage? There’s a bit, but it drops basically to zero after a few seconds (apart from loading the rotating info banners). GPU usage? Zero. Memory usage? Completely flat…</p>
<p>What, is it mining crypto or something? I smell code. <em>Really bad code</em>.</p>
<h2 id="Single-thread-bound"><a href="#Single-thread-bound" title="Single thread-bound"></a>Single thread-bound</h2><p>While my old AMD CPU has 8 cores and it does pack a punch, it was made in the olden days. Back when AMD’s <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://valid.x86.fr/bench/6u7sdy/1">single-thread performance</a> was <em>way</em> behind Intel’s. This might not explain all of the load time differences but it should explain most of it.</p>
<p>What’s odd is that it’s using up <em>just</em> the CPU. I was expecting vast amounts of disk reads loading up resources or loads of network requests trying to negotiate a session in the p2p network. But this? This is probably a bug.</p>
<h2 id="Profiling"><a href="#Profiling" title="Profiling"></a>Profiling</h2><p>Profilers are a great way of finding CPU bottlenecks. There’s only one problem - most of them rely on instrumenting the source code to get a perfect picture of what’s happening in the process. And I don’t have the source code. Nor do I need microsecond-perfect readings - I have 4 minutes’ worth of a bottleneck.</p>
<p>Enter stack sampling: for closed source applications there’s only one option. Dump the running process’ stack and current instruction pointer’s location to build a calling tree in set intervals. Then add them up to get statistics on what’s going on. There’s only one profiler that I know of (might be ignorant here) that can do this on Windows. And it hasn’t been updated in over 10 years. It’s <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://lukestackwalker.sourceforge.net/">Luke Stackwalker</a>! Someone, please give this project some love :)</p>
<p><img src="https://nee.lv/images/pasted-2.png" alt="The power of statistics compels you!"></p>
<p>Normally Luke would group the same functions together but since I don’t have debugging symbols I had to eyeball nearby addresses to guess if it’s the same place. And what do we see? Not one bottleneck but two of them!</p>
<h2 id="Down-the-rabbit-hole"><a href="#Down-the-rabbit-hole" title="Down the rabbit hole"></a>Down the rabbit hole</h2><p>Having borrowed <em>my friend’s</em> completely legitimate copy of <em>the industry-standard disassembler</em> (no, I really can’t afford the thing… gonna learn to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://ghidra-sre.org/">ghidra</a> one of these days) I went to take GTA apart.</p>
<p><img src="https://nee.lv/images/pasted-3.png" alt="Gibberish Galore"></p>
<p>That doesn’t look right at all. Most high-profile games come with built-in protection against reverse engineering to keep away pirates, cheaters, and modders. Not that it has ever stopped them.</p>
<p>There seems to be some sort of an obfuscation/encryption at play here that has replaced most instructions with gibberish. Not to worry, we simply need to dump the game’s memory while it’s executing the part we want to look at. The instructions have to be de-obfuscated before running one way or another. I had <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/glmcdona/Process-Dump">Process Dump</a> lying around, so I used that, but there are plenty of other tools available to do this sort of thing.</p>
<h2 id="Problem-one-It’s…-strlen"><a href="#Problem-one-It’s…-strlen" title="Problem one: It’s… strlen?!"></a>Problem one: It’s… strlen?!</h2><p>Disassembling the now-less-obfuscated dump reveals that one of the addresses has a label pulled out of somewhere! It’s <code>strlen</code>? Going down the call stack the next one is labeled <code>vscan_fn</code> and after that the labels end, tho I’m fairly confident it’s <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/chakra-core/ChakraCore/blob/master/pal/src/safecrt/sscanf.c#L47"><code>sscanf</code></a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://nee.lv/images/pasted-4.png" alt="A graph a day keeps the skeptics away"></p>
<p>It’s parsing something. Parsing what? Untangling the disassembly would take forever so I decided to dump some samples from the running process using <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://x64dbg.com/">x64dbg</a>. Some debug-stepping later it turns out it’s… JSON! They’re parsing JSON. A whopping <strong>10 megabytes</strong> worth of JSON with some <strong>63k item entries</strong>.</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br><span>3</span><br><span>4</span><br><span>5</span><br><span>6</span><br><span>7</span><br><span>8</span><br><span>9</span><br><span>10</span><br><span>11</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>...,</span><br><span>{</span><br><span>    <span>"key"</span>: <span>"WP_WCT_TINT_21_t2_v9_n2"</span>,</span><br><span>    <span>"price"</span>: <span>45000</span>,</span><br><span>    <span>"statName"</span>: <span>"CHAR_KIT_FM_PURCHASE20"</span>,</span><br><span>    <span>"storageType"</span>: <span>"BITFIELD"</span>,</span><br><span>    <span>"bitShift"</span>: <span>7</span>,</span><br><span>    <span>"bitSize"</span>: <span>1</span>,</span><br><span>    <span>"category"</span>: [<span>"CATEGORY_WEAPON_MOD"</span>]</span><br><span>},</span><br><span>...</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p>What is it? It appears to be data for a “net shop catalog” according to some references. I assume it contains a list of all the possible items and upgrades you can buy in GTA Online.</p>
<p>But 10 megs? That’s nothing! And using <code>sscanf</code> may not be optimal but surely it’s not that bad? Well…</p>
<p><img src="https://nee.lv/images/pasted-5.png" alt="Ouch!"></p>
<p>Yeah, that’s gonna take a while… To be fair I had no idea most <code>sscanf</code> implementations called <code>strlen</code> so I can’t blame the developer who wrote this. I would assume it just scanned byte by byte and could stop on a <code>NULL</code>.</p>
<h2 id="Problem-two-Let’s-use-a-Hash-…-Array"><a href="#Problem-two-Let’s-use-a-Hash-…-Array" title="Problem two: Let’s use a Hash- … Array?"></a>Problem two: Let’s use a Hash- … Array?</h2><p>Turns out the second offender is called right next to the first one. They’re both even called in the same <code>if</code> statement as seen in this ugly decompilation:</p>
<p><img src="https://nee.lv/images/pasted-6.png" alt="Beggar thy neighbour"></p>
<p>All labels are mine, no idea what the functions/parameters are actually called.</p>
<p>The second problem? Right after parsing an item, it’s stored in an array (or an inlined C++ list? not sure). Each entry looks something like this:</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br><span>3</span><br><span>4</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span><span><span>struct</span> {</span></span><br><span>    <span>uint64_t</span> *hash;</span><br><span>    <span>item_t</span>   *item;</span><br><span>} entry;</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p>But before it’s stored? It checks the <em>entire</em> array, one by one, comparing the hash of the item to see if it’s in the list or not. With ~63k entries that’s <code>(n^2+n)/2 = (63000^2+63000)/2 = 1984531500</code> checks if my math is right. Most of them useless. You have unique <em>hashes</em> why not use a <em>hash map</em>.</p>
<p><img src="https://nee.lv/images/pasted-7.png" alt="Oof!"></p>
<p>I named it <code>hashmap</code> while reversing but it’s clearly <code>not_a_hashmap</code>. And it gets even better. The hash-array-list-thing is empty before loading the JSON. And all of the items in the JSON are unique! They don’t even <em>need</em> to check if it’s in the list or not! They even have a function to directly insert the items! Just use that! Srsly, WAT!?</p>
<h2 id="PoC"><a href="#PoC" title="PoC"></a>PoC</h2><p>Now that’s nice and all, but no one is going to take me seriously unless I test this so I can write a clickbait title for the post.</p>
<p>The plan? Write a <code>.dll</code>, inject it in GTA, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/TsudaKageyu/minhook">hook</a> some functions, ???, profit.</p>
<p>The JSON problem is hairy, I can’t realistically replace their parser. Replacing <code>sscanf</code> with one that doesn’t depend on <code>strlen</code> would be more realistic. But there’s an even easier way.</p>
<ul>
<li>hook strlen</li>
<li>wait for a long string</li>
<li>“cache” the start and length of it</li>
<li>if it’s called again within the string’s range, return cached value</li>
</ul>
<p>Something like:</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br><span>3</span><br><span>4</span><br><span>5</span><br><span>6</span><br><span>7</span><br><span>8</span><br><span>9</span><br><span>10</span><br><span>11</span><br><span>12</span><br><span>13</span><br><span>14</span><br><span>15</span><br><span>16</span><br><span>17</span><br><span>18</span><br><span>19</span><br><span>20</span><br><span>21</span><br><span>22</span><br><span>23</span><br><span>24</span><br><span>25</span><br><span>26</span><br><span>27</span><br><span>28</span><br><span>29</span><br><span>30</span><br><span>31</span><br><span>32</span><br><span>33</span><br><span>34</span><br><span>35</span><br><span>36</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span><span><span>size_t</span> <span>strlen_cacher</span><span>(<span>char</span>* str)</span></span></span><br><span><span></span>{</span><br><span>  <span>static</span> <span>char</span>* start;</span><br><span>  <span>static</span> <span>char</span>* end;</span><br><span>  <span>size_t</span> len;</span><br><span>  <span>const</span> <span>size_t</span> cap = <span>20000</span>;</span><br><span></span><br><span>  </span><br><span>  <span>if</span> (start &amp;&amp; str &gt;= start &amp;&amp; str &lt;= end) {</span><br><span>    </span><br><span>    len = end - str;</span><br><span></span><br><span>    </span><br><span>    </span><br><span>    <span>if</span> (len &lt; cap / <span>2</span>)</span><br><span>      MH_DisableHook((LPVOID)strlen_addr);</span><br><span></span><br><span>    </span><br><span>    <span>return</span> len;</span><br><span>  }</span><br><span></span><br><span>  </span><br><span>  </span><br><span>  </span><br><span>  len = builtin_strlen(str);</span><br><span></span><br><span>  </span><br><span>  </span><br><span>  <span>if</span> (len &gt; cap) {</span><br><span>    start = str;</span><br><span>    end = str + len;</span><br><span>  }</span><br><span></span><br><span>  </span><br><span>  <span>return</span> len;</span><br><span>}</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p>And as for the hash-array problem, it’s more straightforward - just skip the duplicate checks entirely and insert the items directly since we know the values are unique.</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br><span>3</span><br><span>4</span><br><span>5</span><br><span>6</span><br><span>7</span><br><span>8</span><br><span>9</span><br><span>10</span><br><span>11</span><br><span>12</span><br><span>13</span><br><span>14</span><br><span>15</span><br><span>16</span><br><span>17</span><br><span>18</span><br><span>19</span><br><span>20</span><br><span>21</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span><span><span>char</span> __fastcall <span>netcat_insert_dedupe_hooked</span><span>(<span>uint64_t</span> catalog, <span>uint64_t</span>* key, <span>uint64_t</span>* item)</span></span></span><br><span><span></span>{</span><br><span>  </span><br><span>  <span>uint64_t</span> not_a_hashmap = catalog + <span>88</span>;</span><br><span></span><br><span>  </span><br><span>  <span>if</span> (!(*(<span>uint8_t</span>(__fastcall**)(<span>uint64_t</span>*))(*item + <span>48</span>))(item))</span><br><span>    <span>return</span> <span>0</span>;</span><br><span></span><br><span>  </span><br><span>  netcat_insert_direct(not_a_hashmap, key, &amp;item);</span><br><span></span><br><span>  </span><br><span>  </span><br><span>  <span>if</span> (*key == <span>0x7FFFD6BE</span>) {</span><br><span>    MH_DisableHook((LPVOID)netcat_insert_dedupe_addr);</span><br><span>    unload();</span><br><span>  }</span><br><span></span><br><span>  <span>return</span> <span>1</span>;</span><br><span>}</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p>Hell yes, it did! :))</p>
<p>Most likely, this won’t solve everyone’s load times - there might be other bottlenecks on different systems, but it’s such a gaping hole that I have no idea how R* has missed it all these years.</p>
<h2 id="tl-dr"><a href="#tl-dr" title="tl;dr"></a>tl;dr</h2><ul>
<li>There’s a single thread CPU bottleneck while starting up GTA Online</li>
<li>It turns out GTA struggles to parse a 10MB JSON file</li>
<li>The JSON parser itself is poorly built / naive and</li>
<li>After parsing there’s a slow item de-duplication routine</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="R-please-fix"><a href="#R-please-fix" title="R* please fix"></a>R* please fix</h2><p>If this somehow reaches Rockstar: the problems shouldn’t take more than a day for a single dev to solve. Please do something about it :&lt;</p>
<p>You could either switch to a hashmap for the de-duplication or completely skip it on startup as a faster fix. For the JSON parser - just swap out the library for a more performant one. I don’t think there’s any easier way out.</p>
<p>ty &lt;3</p>
<h2 id="Small-update"><a href="#Small-update" title="Small update"></a>Small update</h2><p>I was expecting to get some attention but nowhere near this much! After reaching the top of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26296339">HN</a> this post has spread like wildfire! <strong>Thank you for the overwhelming response :)</strong></p>
<p>I’ll do more writing if something interesting comes along, but don’t expect anything of this scale soon - there was a lot of luck involved.</p>
<p>A few people suggested spamming this post to Rockstar’s support - please don’t! I’m sure they’ve seen this by now. Continuing would only bog down support tickets for everyone else. Social media is fair game in my book tho.</p>
<p>Several HN comments suggested I add a donate button, as they would like to buy me a beer (thank you!) so I’m <del>placing a link in the footer</del>.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading and all the support :)</p>

<li>Got confirmation from R* that this is getting a fix soon</li>
<li>Just got awarded $10k through their H1 in-game bounty as an exception :)) (usually only for security issues)</li>
<li>Trying to figure out what’s a W8 and how to fill it (lol)</li>
<li>I did try asking for more technical details but they couldn’t say anything</li>
<li>Will do another  benchmark on my same old setup as soon as the update is out, I’m sure their engineers won’t disappoint :)</li>

<p>Apple’s limited warranty doesn’t cover damage caused by liquids, even for water-resistant products like the iPhone, Apple Watch, and some AirPods models. Because of this, Apple has different methods to detect if the device has been exposed to liquids. And on the latest Macs, Apple now has a way of knowing if liquids have been detected in the USB-C ports.</p>







<p>As noted by <em>9to5Mac</em>, <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/10/25/macos-sonoma-14-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">macOS Sonoma 14.1</a> includes a new system daemon named “liquiddetectiond,” which, as the name suggests, can identify when the computer has been exposed to liquids. More specifically, this daemon runs in the background to collect liquid detection analysis from each USB-C port on the Mac.</p>



<p>This daemon is described as a “Liquid Detection and Corrosion Mitigation Daemon.” iPhones and iPads have a similar daemon, which is used to alert users when liquid is detected in the connector so that they immediately unplug the charging cable to prevent damage.</p>



<p>On the Mac, however, the code suggests that the daemon is only used for “analytics” and is not associated with end-user features. While Apple may eventually implement an alert similar to the one that already exists in iOS, it seems more likely that the data collected by this daemon will be used for technicians to determine whether a Mac is eligible for free repair.</p>



<p>Of course, that’s just one more way for Apple to know if the Mac has been exposed to liquids. As <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201880" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple’s website describes</a>, “Mac laptop computers and some Apple wired and wireless keyboards have Liquid Contact Indicators (LCI) to help determine if these products have been exposed to liquid.”</p>

<p>These indicators are strategically placed inside the devices and change color when they come into contact with liquids. Putting a digital liquid detector on USB-C ports is just another way to ensure that technicians are right about claiming that a Mac has been exposed to liquids.</p>



<p>It’s unclear at this point whether the new daemon works with any Macs running the latest version of macOS or only with <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/10/30/new-m3-imac/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">M3 Macs</a> due to some extra hardware requirement.</p>

Using this fact, we show how arbitrary programs can be compiled into Find+Replace transformers, potentially aiding interpretability research. We also demonstrate the superior performance of Find+Replace transformers over GPT-4 on a set of composition challenge problems.

<p>United Airlines has found loose bolts and other parts on 737 Max 9 plug doors as it inspects its fleet of Boeing jets following the Friday rapid depressurization aboard an Alaska Airlines jet of the same make, according to three people familiar with the findings.</p>
<p>The discrepant bolts and other parts on the plug doors have been found on at least five aircraft, one of the people told <em>The Air Current</em>.</p>
<p><span>A Boeing representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokeswoman for the Federal Aviation Administration declined to comment on the United findings, and pointed to the agency’s </span><a href="https://www.faa.gov/newsroom/updates-grounding-boeing-737-max-9-aircraft"><span>earlier statements</span></a><span>.</span></p>

<p><span>United confirmed the findings in a statement, saying, “Since we began preliminary inspections on Saturday, we have found instances that appear to relate to installation issues in the door plug – for example, bolts that needed additional tightening. These findings will be remedied by our Tech Ops team to safely return the aircraft to service.”</span></p>
<p><span>The findings aboard the five United aircraft will likely significantly widen the fall-out from the grounding, intensifying the focus on Boeing and Spirit AeroSystems. The pair together is responsible for the assembly, installation and quality checks of the aircraft structure.</span></p>

<p><span>Across the five aircraft, there is little consistency in the locations of the errant parts, according to documents reviewed by </span><i><span>The Air Current.</span></i><span> In one instance, United found that the bolts that affix the lower hinge of the plug door were not fully seated, and that the washers on the bolts could “spin”.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Another aircraft was found to have loose bolts on the upper forward guide fitting on the plug and another on the forward guide roller that is an attachment point to the fuselage on the door frame. Additionally, screws that are part of the lower hinge bracket at the bottom of the plug on another aircraft were found to not be fully screwed in.</span></p>
<p><span>The five aircraft were delivered to United between November 2022 and September 2023, according to ch-aviation, and would likely not have been through a heavy maintenance C check that occurs every 4,000 to 6,000 hours or two to three years.</span></p>
<p><span>United is the only other U.S. airline to fly the 737 Max 9 and is the largest operator with 79 in its fleet. Alaska operates 65.</span></p>
<p><span>Boeing earlier Monday confirmed that it had formally distributed a Multi-Operator Message (MOM) to 737 Max 9 operators, prescribing the specific inspection criteria that would satisfy the <a href="https://theaircurrent.com/feed/dispatches/faa-orders-temporary-grounding-of-boeing-737-max-9-fleet/">emergency airworthiness directive</a> issued by the FAA on January 6, a day after the Alaska accident.</span></p>
<p><span>Alaska on Monday morning </span><a href="https://news.alaskaair.com/alaska-airlines/operations/as-1282/"><span>said</span></a><span> that before inspections could begin, the FAA would need to approve operators’ inspection processes to ensure compliance, and that the airline would need to develop detailed inspection instructions and processes for its maintenance technicians to follow. Alaska said that it canceled roughly 140 flights for Monday due to the 737 Max 9 grounding.</span></p>
<p><span>NTSB investigators announced late Sunday that they had recovered the plug that violently separated from the Alaska flight at 16,000 feet. No one was hurt in the accident.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The board has not released any specific findings related to the door or said whether the accident was in any way caused by discrepancies in the plug installation.</span></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Now, Dillin and his team have expanded that finding by discovering new details about how mitochondria in the brain communicate with cells across the worm’s body to extend life.</p>
<p>First, he had to understand why damage to the brain’s mitochondria could possibly have a beneficial effect on the organism. A mitochondrion’s process for generating energy requires exceedingly complex molecular machinery with dozens of different protein parts. When things go awry, such as when some components are missing or misfolded, mitochondria activate a stress response, known as the unfolded protein response, which delivers repair enzymes to help the complexes assemble properly and restore mitochondrial function. In this way, the unfolded protein response keeps cells healthy.</p>
<p>Dillin expected this process to unfold only inside the neurons with damaged mitochondria. Yet he observed that cells in other tissues of the worm’s body also turned on repair responses even though their mitochondria were intact.</p>

<p>It’s this repair activity that helped the worms live longer. Like taking a car to a mechanic regularly, the unfolded protein response seemed to keep cells in good running order and function as anti-aging detailing. What remained mysterious was how this unfolded protein response was communicated to the rest of the organism.</p>
<p>After some investigation, Dillin’s team discovered that the mitochondria in stressed neurons were using vesicles — bubblelike containers that move materials around the cell or between cells — to carry a signal called Wnt beyond the nerve cells to other cells in the body. Biologists already knew that Wnt plays a role in setting up the body pattern during early embryonic development, during which it also triggers repair processes like the unfolded protein response. Still, how could Wnt signaling, when turned on in an adult, avoid activating the embryonic program?</p>
<p>Dillin suspected that there had to be another signal that Wnt interacted with. After further work, the researchers discovered that a gene expressed in the mitochondria of the germline — and in no other mitochondria — can interrupt Wnt’s developmental processes. That result suggested to him that <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.08.21.554217v2">germline cells play critical roles</a> in relaying the Wnt signal between the nervous system and tissues throughout the rest of the body.</p>
<p>“The&nbsp;germline is absolutely essential&nbsp;for this,” Dillin said. It isn’t clear, however, whether the germline mitochondria act as amplifiers, receiving the signal from the brain’s mitochondria and transmitting it to other tissues, or if the receiving tissues are “listening” for signals from both sources.</p>
<p>Either way, the strength of the germline signal regulates the organism’s life span, Dillin said. As a worm ages, the quality of its eggs or sperm declines — what we refer to as the ticking of a biological clock. The decline is also reflected in the germ cells’ changing ability to transmit signals from the brain’s mitochondria, he suggested. As the worm grows older, its germline transmits the repair signal less effectively, and so its body declines, too.</p>

<p>Scientists don’t yet know whether these findings apply to humans and how we age. Still, the hypothesis makes sense from a broader evolutionary standpoint, Dillin said. As long as the germ cells are healthy, they send pro-survival signals to ensure that their host organism survives to reproduce. But as the quality of the germ cells declines, there is no evolutionary reason to keep extending life span further; from evolution’s perspective, life exists to reproduce itself.</p>
<p>The fact that mitochondria can talk among themselves might seem somewhat alarming, but there is an explanation. Long ago, mitochondria were free-living bacteria that joined forces with another type of primitive cell to work together in what became our modern complex cells. So, their ability to communicate is probably a relic from the free-living bacterial ancestor of mitochondria.</p>
<p>“This little thing that’s been ticking inside of cells for billions of years still retains its bacterial origins,” Dillin said. And if his research in worms holds up in more complex organisms like humans, it’s possible that your mitochondria are talking right now about your age.</p>

<p>'<strong>Как пропатчить KDE2 под FreeBSD?</strong>' or '<strong>How does one patch KDE2 under FreeBSD?</strong>' is a phrase largely confined to Russian and East European <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/cultures/the-internet">Internet</a> culture.</p>
<p>Since its inception, 'Как пропатчить KDE2 под FreeBSD?' has gained some media coverage for being publicly answered by Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev and Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko.</p>
<p>'KDE2' refers to the 'K Desktop Environment', a community of open source applications, and 'FreeBSD' refers to the open source operating system.</p>

<em>RusNet</em> and <em>Bash</em>
</h3>
<p>On May 8th, 2004, Alexander Kosyrin, a prominent Russian enthusiast of Japanese animation, or '<em>animeshnikov</em>', known as <a href="http://dead-persimmon.livejournal.com/" target="_blank">'DEAD_PERSIMMON'</a> on <em><a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/sites/livejournal">LiveJournal</a></em> and 'Sashok' on <em>Internet Relay Chat</em>, initiated a satirical conversation on the '#<a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/cultures/anime-manga">anime</a>' channel of <em>RusNet</em>, Eastern Europe's and Central Asia's largest <em>Internet Relay Chat</em> network.</p>
<p>The following quotation is a simplification of the actual conversation.</p>
<p>In Russian,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sashok: Здравствуйте, это канал об аниме?<br>
Да.<br>
Sashok: Как мне пропатчить KDE2 под FreeBSD?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In English,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sashok: Hello, is this the '#anime' channel?<br>
Yes.<br>
Sashok: How does one patch KDE2 under FreeBSD?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alexander Kosyrin intended to satirize the community of the '#anime' channel of <em>RusNet</em>, which was composed of enthusiasts of computer programming, network administration, and information technology who seldom discussed Japanese animation, preferring to discuss more 'geeky' topics. For humorous purposes, Alexander Kosyrin acknowledged that the channel was '#anime' but posted the irrelevant message anyways, instead of posting in the more appropriate '#freebsd', '#unix', or '#kde' channels.</p>
<p>On August 30th, 2004, <a href="http://bash.org.ru/quote/42" target="_blank">the quotation was submitted to and accepted by 'www.bash.org.ru'</a> <sup id="fnr1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup>, a website similar to 'www.bash.org' as they both serve as archives of <em>Internet Relay Chat</em> conversations. The quotation became popular on the website with a score of 62,214 and spawned numerous popular derivatives, such as <a href="http://bash.org.ru/quote/2671" target="_blank">this</a> ,</p>
<p>In Russian,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>moontiger: мне нравятся лозунги типа "рок против наркотиков"<br>
moontiger: и "панк против водки"<br>
moontiger: ну там "скины против расизма"<br>
moontiger: и еще "готы против суицида"<br>

moontiger: ну и, конечно, "КАМ против кефира"<br>
moontiger: [в угоду колену] "анимешники против KDE2 под FreeBSD"</p>

<p>In English,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>moontiger: I like slogans like "Rock Against Drugs"<br>

moontiger: And there's "Skinheads Against Racism"<br>
moontiger: And even "Goths Against Suicide"<br>
moontiger: And "Satanists Against Lucifer"<br>
moontiger: And of course, "KAM Against Kafir"<br>
moontiger: And "Anime Fans Against KDE2 Under FreeBSD"</p>

<h3 id="livejournal"><em>LiveJournal</em></h3>
<p>On October 16th, 2005, A group of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaschenism" target="_blank">pseudo-Jewish trolls called Kaschenists</a> <sup id="fnr2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup> formed a <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/kde2podfreebsd/" target="_blank"><em>LiveJournal</em> group called 'kde2podfreebsd'</a> which dedicated itself to <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/cultures/trolling">trolling</a> enthusiasts of Japanese animation by frequently mentioning 'How does one patch KDE2 under FreeBSD?' as seen <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/kde2podfreebsd/1527.html" target="_blank">here</a> .</p>

<p>As a result, strict rules were implemented in the '#anime' channel of <em>RusNet</em> and in the <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/ru_anime" target="_blank"><em>LiveJournal</em> group 'ru_anime'</a> which prohibited any mention of KDE2 or FreeBSD in a humorous context.</p>
<h3 id="russian-president-vladimir-putin">Russian President Vladimir Putin</h3>
<p>Russian President <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/people/vladimir-putin">Vladimir Putin</a> was scheduled to appear at a conference on July 6th, 2006 in which Internet users could submit and vote on questions <a href="http://president.yandex.ru/" target="_blank">here</a> . In the <a href="http://president.yandex.ru/theme.xml?id=76" target="_blank">'Internet Connection' category</a> , some humorous questions were submitted.</p>
<p><a href="http://president.yandex.ru/question.xml?id=155546" target="_blank">The most popular question</a> <sup id="fnr3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup> with 28,424 votes, submitted by Кросавчег, 19, of Moscow, was,</p>

<p><a href="http://president.yandex.ru/question.xml?id=194536" target="_blank">The third most popular question</a> , submitted by Серега, 27, of Tambov, was,</p>

<p>In English,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Comrade President, how does one patch KDE2 under FreeBSD?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite the questions' popularity, neither question was answered.</p>

 <h3 id="kazakh-president-nursultan-nazarbayev">Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev</h3>
<p>In a similar conference held on June 7th, 2007, Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev was asked the most popular question, which was <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070927194049/http://e.gov.kz/online/showCard.jsp?id=424" target="_blank">this</a> ,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How does one patch KDE2 under FreeBSD?<br>
47,955 votes</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nursultan Nazarbayev managed to answer the question seriously, saying,</p>
<p>In Kazakh,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ответ на этот вопрос лежит в чисто технической плоскости. Могу сказать, что в Казахстане сейчас усиленно развивается национальная индустрия программного обеспечения и думаю, что решения, основанные на технологии Open Source имеют право на жизнь. Существует проект Национальной защищённой операционной системы в рамках государственной программы формирования электронного правительства, которая сейчас реализуется Агентством РК по информатизации и связи. Думаю, что подобные проекты достаточно перспективны. В связи с этим возникают определённые проблемы с подготовкой специалистов в соответствующих областях, но они все решаемы. Существуют курсы по изучению программного обеспечения Open Source, на которых можно получить соответствующие знания." Кроме того, считаю целесообразным упомянуть об истории возникновения вопроса. Данный вопрос был задан 8 мая 2004 года на чате #anime (аниме – японский жанр мультипликации) видимо в шутку, частично связанную с тем, что в числе почитателей аниме (анимешников) много unix-администраторов. по другой версии вопрос был серьёзно задан лицом, не знающим, что такое аниме, но предполагающим, что чат посвящён вопросам администрирования unix. С тех пор шутка приобрела большую популярность.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In English,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The answer to this question is purely technical. I can say that Kazakhstan is now vigorously developing its own software industry and I think that solutions based on open source technologies should be considered. There is a state program for e-government which is now being implemented by the State Agency of Information and Communication. I think that such projects are quite promising. In this regard, there are certain problems with the training of specialists in relevant fields, but they are all being solved. There are courses on open source software where you can get such knowledge. <br>
Also, I consider it appropriate to mention the history of the issue. This question was asked on May 8, 2004 on the chat #anime (anime – Japanese animation), apparently in jest, partly associated with the fact that these anime lovers (animeshnikov) were also UNIX administrators. It was asked by someone wanting to discuss anime, but I suppose that the discussion was devoted to UNIX administration. Since then, the joke has become very popular.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Reuters</em> wrote of the bizarre queries on June 1st, 2007, in an article titled <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL0131903220070601" target="_blank">'Kazakhs shower president with cryptic questions'</a> , which noted,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The cryptic software question -- "How does one patch KDE under FreeBSD?" -- appeared to be the most popular query posted on the webcast site, with more that 11,000 people asking for it to be forwarded to the 66-year-old leader.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin faced a similar question and answer session on the Internet last year when Russians asked their leader questions such as whether he planned to employ "giant, humanoid war robots".</p>

<blockquote>
<p>More than 9,000 people wanted to know "when the authorities will start chopping off civil servants' tongues for lying to the president in the most outrageous way", was the portal's second-most favorite question as of Friday evening.</p>

The <a href="http://president2007.pravda.com.ua/view_popular/" target="_blank">most popular question</a> , which gained 37,627 votes, was submitted by Нестор on December 24th, 2007,</p>

<p>Viktor Yushchenko <a href="http://president2007.pravda.com.ua/answers/" target="_blank">provided the following answer</a> <sup id="fnr4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup>,</p>
<p>In Ukrainian,</p>

<p>In English,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear friends, the programmers at the Presidential Secretariat can patch KDE2 in different operating systems. The second option would be to use newer software that does not confuse users.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His 'second option' likely refers to fact that KDE2 became outdated when KDE3 was released on April 3rd, 2002.</p>

However, he gave the invitation to his friend, who then received an <em><a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/subcultures/xbox">XBox</a> 360</em> at the conference. The question was not asked to Steve Ballmer, likely due to its reference to competing products and irrelevant subject.</p>

<p>While 'Как пропатчить KDE2 под FreeBSD?' is popular on the 'Runet', or 'Russian Internet', it remains obscure in the Anglosphere, though a <a href="http://www.google.ca/search?q=how+does+one+patch+kde2+under+freebsd&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=HCUvTOeQKMShnQfL8ZX5CA&amp;start=0&amp;sa=N" target="_blank"><em></em></a><em><a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/sites/google">Google</a> Search</em> for 'How does one patch KDE2 under FreeBSD?' does reveal some trolling on support forums<sup id="fnr5"><a href="#fn5">[5]</a></sup>.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
                    <div id="post-wrapper">
                            <p>Last week I got a message from my dad (who works with me at a client) with an image attached.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://pictshare.net/hdkhikv83m.png"><figcaption>Message from dad</figcaption></figure>
<p>I asked him to unplug it, store it in a safe location, take photos of all parts and to make an image from the SD card (since I mostly work remote). I have worked on many Raspberry Pi projects and I felt confident I could find out what it does.</p>
<p>At this point nobody thought it was going to be malicious, more like one of our staffers was playing around with something.</p>
<h2>The parts</h2>
<p>There were 3 parts: </p>
<ul>
<li>A Raspberry Pi b first generation</li>
<li>a mysterious USB dongle</li>
<li>a 16GB sd card (a fast one)</li>
</ul>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://pictshare.net/gfss00puet.jpg"><figcaption>USB dongle and SD card</figcaption></figure>
<h2>First thing to do: Ask everybody who can access this network closet</h2>
<p>The number of people who can access this small cabinet is very limited. Only 4 people have a key for this room:</p>
<ol>
<li>The manager</li>
<li>The groundskeeper</li>
<li>My co-worker</li>
<li>Me</li>
</ol>
<p>None of them knew anything about this so I asked my IT colleagues and they were as baffled as I was. I heard of people getting paid to put things like this in places they shouldn't and for this reason I was very interested in finding out what it actually does.</p>
<h2>What is that USB dongle though?</h2>
<p>To help me solve this mistery <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/9xveq5/rogue_raspberrypi_found_in_network_closet_need/">I asked reddit</a> and surely enough they identified the dongle as a microprocessor, almost as powerful as the Rasberry Pi itself: the <a href="https://wiki.makerdiary.com/nrf52832-mdk/">nRF52832-MDK</a>. A very powerful wifi, bluetooth and RFID reader.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://pictshare.net/lrc3fnqrl7.jpg"><figcaption>The nRF52832-MDK usb dongle</figcaption></figure>
<p>This was - no doubt - to give the old Raspberry Pi a wifi and bluetooth connection. Great so now this thing has wifi too..</p>
<h2>Time to dissect the SD card image</h2>
<p>The SD card has a few partitions. Most ext4 (linux) and one fat16 (boot)</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://pictshare.net/htpg3y9xhu.png"><figcaption>GParted view of the image</figcaption></figure>
<p>Great, time to mount it.</p>
<p>My debian box told me the first big clue: It's a resin installation</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.pictshare.net/wt9hqp.png"><figcaption>Resin partitions on the SD Card</figcaption></figure>
<h2>WTF is Resin?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.balena.io/">Resin (now renamed to Balena)</a> is a paid <a href="https://www.balena.io/what-is-balena">IOT web service</a> where you can generate images for IOT devices, deploy those devices and get updates and data from and to resin.</p>
<p>Resin also installs a VPN on the device so the collected data is transferred securely. Obviously this device was meant to be picked up again since it leaves a trail as the service is a paid one.</p>
<h2>Closer look at the partitions</h2>
<p>First partition is called <strong>"resin-boot"</strong> </p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.pictshare.net/n7rq00.png"></figure>
<p>See something that catches your eye? We got a <code>config.json</code>. Quick jackpot?</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.pictshare.net/y9tq3d93ru.png"><figcaption>config.json on the resin-boot partition</figcaption></figure>
<p>What we can extract from this file:</p>
<ol>
<li>The application deployed to this resin device is called <strong>"logger"</strong>. Not a good sign</li>
<li>We got a <strong>username</strong>. This seems to be the username for the resin account associated with this device</li>
<li>Confirmation that the device used a <strong>VPN</strong> via Port 443</li>
<li>A registration date. It was registered (or first deployed or set up?) on <strong>May 13th 2018</strong></li>
</ol>
<h3>About that username..</h3>
<p>When I googled the username found in the config.json file I found a person in the same town where this Pi was found. The company then checked their records for this person but found nothing.</p>
<p>Oddly enough I found a website from 2001 where parents of "gifted children" write articles about them and for some reason sign those articles with their home address and phone numbers. So I have a name and the address of this whole family.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://pictshare.net/800/9drvd1.jpg"><figcaption>Not the actual site but a similar one</figcaption></figure>
<p>This could be a wrong lead as usernames tend to be used by multiple people but let's just keep that name in mind.</p>
<h3>resin-data</h3>
<p>The data directory didn't have any data stored (as in: <em>collected data</em>) but there was a nodejs app which was heavily obfuscated and to this day I can't tell exactly what it was doing. It seems to talk via a serial connection to the dongle but I can't extract what data is actually collected. I can only assume that it collected movement profiles of bluetooth and wifi devices in the area (around the Managers office) and maybe raw wifi packets.</p>
<p>But I found something much more interesting: a <code>LICENSE.md</code> file</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.pictshare.net/7ora0e.png"><figcaption>Screenshot of the LICENSE.md file</figcaption></figure>
<p>Odd.. Why would this nodejs app include a confidential piece of software? I googled the company from the copyright header and guess what? </p>
<h2>The guy from the username I found in the config file is a part owner</h2>
<p>It is beyond me why a co-founder of a company would distribute these devices around town but well..</p>
<hr>
<h2>Getting the attackers home address</h2>
<p>Another very interesting thing I found was a file on the third partition (<code>resin-state</code>) in the path <code>/root-overlay/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/</code>. The file is called <strong>resin-wifi-01</strong> and guess what it contains?</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.pictshare.net/8vdh9k.png"></figure>
<p>It contains the wifi credentials to the wifi that was used to set the device up (or to test it). Definitely not the wifi of the company. And what do we do, when we want to find out a location associated with a wifi name? We go to wigle.net, enter the SSID (=wifi name) and it tells us where on the world it is found.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.pictshare.net/6ztf78.png"><figcaption>not the actual name and not the actual location</figcaption></figure>
<p>And guess what? The address we found of that gifted persons parents? <strong>That's exactly where our Pi was set up</strong> according to Wigle.net</p>
<h2>Aftermath</h2>
<h2>How and when did the Pi even get there?</h2>
<p>I checked the DNS logs and found the exact date and time when the Pi was first seen in the network. I checked the RADIUS logs to see which employee was at the premises at that time and I saw multiple error messages that a deactivated account tried to connect to wifi.</p>
<p>That deactivated account belongs to an ex employee who (for some reason) made a deal with management that he could still have a key for a few months until he moved all his stuff out of the building (don't ask..).</p>
<h2>What now</h2>
<p>Legal has taken over, I did my part and the rest is over my pay grade.</p>
<p>For me it was a very interesting challenge and I'd like to thank every person on reddit who helped me with one piece of the puzzle.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="contents">
			<h2>The Eight Golden Rules of Interface Design</h2>
			<p>I have often been asked to distill the vast corpus of user interface design into a few key principles. While I was reluctant to do this, it turned out to be a good exercise to write “Golden Rules,” that are applicable in most interactive systems. These principles, derived from experience and refined over three decades, require validation and tuning for specific design domains. No list such as this can be complete, but even the original list from 1985, has been well received as a useful guide to students and designers. Jakob Nielsen, Jeff Johnson, and others have expanded these rules and included their variations, which enriches the discussion. Each edition of the book produces some changes. This version is from Section 3.3.4 of the Sixth edition:<br>
			</p><p>
				Shneiderman, B., Plaisant, C., Cohen, M., Jacobs, S., and Elmqvist, N., Designing the User Interface: Strategies for Effective Human-Computer Interaction: Sixth Edition, Pearson (May 2016) <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/DTUI6">http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/DTUI6</a></p>
			
			
			<hr>
				
			<h3>1. Strive for consistency.</h3>
			<p>Consistent sequences of actions should be required in similar situations; identical terminology should be used in prompts, menus, and help screens; and consistent color, layout, capitalization, fonts, and so on, should be employed throughout. Exceptions, such as required confirmation of the delete command or no echoing of passwords, should be comprehensible and limited in number</p>
 
			<h3>2. Seek universal usability.</h3>
			<p>Recognize the needs of diverse users and design for plasticity, facilitating transformation of content. Novice to expert differences, age ranges, disabilities, international variations, and technological diversity each enrich the spectrum of requirements that guides design. Adding features for novices, such as explanations, and features for experts, such as shortcuts and faster pacing, enriches the interface design and improves perceived quality.</p>
 
			<h3>3. Offer informative feedback.</h3>
			<p>For every user action, there should be an interface feedback. For frequent and minor actions, the response can be modest, whereas for infrequent and major actions, the response should be more substantial. Visual presentation of the objects of interest provides a convenient environment for showing changes explicitly (see the discussion of direct manipulation in Chapter 7).</p>
 
			<h3>4. Design dialogs to yield closure.</h3>
			<p>Sequences of actions should be organized into groups with a beginning, middle, and end. Informative feedback at the completion of a group of actions gives users the satisfaction of accomplishment, a sense of relief, a signal to drop contingency plans from their minds, and an indicator to prepare for the next group of actions. For example, e-commerce websites move users from selecting products to the checkout, ending with a clear confirmation page that completes the transaction.</p>
 
			<h3>5. Prevent errors.</h3>
			<p>As much as possible, design the interface so that users cannot make serious errors; for example, gray out menu items that are not appropriate and do not allow alphabetic characters in numeric entry fields (Section 3.3.5). If users make an error, the interface should offer simple, constructive, and specific instructions for recovery. For example, users should not have to retype an entire name-address form if they enter an invalid zip code but rather should be guided to repair only the faulty part. Erroneous actions should leave the interface state unchanged, or the interface should give instructions about restoring the state.</p>
 
			<h3>6. Permit easy reversal of actions.</h3>
			<p>As much as possible, actions should be reversible. This feature relieves anxiety, since users know that errors can be undone, and encourages exploration of unfamiliar options. The units of reversibility may be a single action, a data-entry task, or a complete group of actions, such as entry of a name-address block.</p>
 
			<h3>7. Keep users in control.</h3>
			<p>Experienced users strongly desire the sense that they are in charge of the interface and that the interface responds to their actions. They don’t want surprises or changes in familiar behavior, and they are annoyed by tedious data-entry sequences, difficulty in obtaining necessary information, and inability to produce their desired result.</p>
 
			<h3>8. Reduce short-term memory load.</h3>
			<p>Humans’ limited capacity for information processing in short-term memory (the rule of thumb is that people can remember “seven plus or minus two chunks” of information) requires that designers avoid interfaces in which users must remember information from one display and then use that information on another display. It means that cellphones should not require reentry of phone numbers, website locations should remain visible, and lengthy forms should be compacted to fit a single display. </p>
 
			<p>These underlying principles must be interpreted, refined, and extended for each environment. They have their limitations, but they provide a good starting point for mobile, desktop, and web designers. The principles presented in the ensuing sections focus on increasing users’ productivity by providing simplified data-entry procedures, comprehensible displays, and rapid informative feedback to increase feelings of competence, mastery, and control over the system.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
            <p>What are the trade-offs between different kinds of CRDTs (Conflict-free Replicated Data Types)? Most introductory talks cover just state-based and operations-based CRDTs because that's what the original paper formulated. But since then, there have been other variations, and I haven't seen much written about them in blog posts, so I'll cover their trade-offs here. </p><ul><li><a href="https://www.bartoszsypytkowski.com/the-state-of-a-state-based-crdts/">State-based CRDTs</a> (convergent CRDTs)</li><li><a href="https://www.bartoszsypytkowski.com/operation-based-crdts-protocol/">Operation-based CRDTs</a> (commutative CRDTs)</li><li><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.2803.pdf">δ-state-based CRDTs</a></li><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230607175939/https://novasys.di.fct.unl.pt/~alinde/publications/a12-van_der_linde.pdf">Δ-state-based CRDTs</a></li></ul><p>The basics of <a href="https://crdt.tech/">CRDTs</a> are covered in a lot of other different places [^1], so I won't try to speed run it here. Let's just jump into the differences.</p><h2 id="state-based-crdts-convergent-crdts">State-based CRDTs (Convergent CRDTs)</h2><p>In State-based CRDTs, a replica's state can be updated by a merge operation with another replica's state. But if the <a href="https://architecturenotes.co/fallacies-of-distributed-systems/">network is unreliable and can deliver events out of order</a>, how would all the replicas achieve convergence and agreement of all their states? The trick is simply to restrict ourselves to data structures and operations that are immune to net-splits and out-of-order delivery. </p><p>First, the internal data structure of the CRDT must be monotonically increasing. Second, the merge operation has to be commutative, associative, and idempotent with respect to the internal data structures.</p><p>These constraints make the CRDT immune to the unreliable network. As long as all replicas eventually see every state update event, they're guaranteed to converge to the same state. Due to the use of vector clocks, replicas coming in and out of the network are easily handled. The internal bookkeeping grows linearly with the number of replicas.</p><p>The rest of the design problem is how to build useful data structures out of only monotonically increasing elements. Luckily, there is already a <a href="https://github.com/pfrazee/crdt_notes/tree/68c5fe81ade109446a9f4c24e03290ec5493031f#portfolio-of-basic-crdts">menagerie of CRDTs</a> that can model numbers, arrays, maps, strings, and other common data structures.</p><p>State-based CRDTs are theoretically sound, but in practice, it has a glaring downside: they require sending the entire state of a replica over the network to other replicas. This can be prohibitive for all but the smallest states like counters and registers. That's because a CRDT needs to maintain internal bookkeeping of "which replica said what" at some logical time in order to resolve conflicts for any new state changes. The end-user queries this internal bookkeeping for a current value, like a functional view calculated from the actual state, the internal bookkeeping. For anything beyond a counter or register, this internal bookkeeping can be too big for sets and maps. And as the number of replicas grows, it can grow too big too quickly.</p><p>Therefore, most current CRDT implementations are not state-based but op-based. </p><div><p>💡</p><p>- Uses merge function to converge<br>- Merge function needs to be commutative, associative, and idempotent<br>- Internal data structure needs to be monotonically increasing</p></div><div><p>👍</p><p>- Easy syncing protocol that just broadcasts new state to other replicas<br>- Does not need to keep a history to sync (as we'll see later)</p></div><div><p>👎</p><p>- Sending the entire state over the wire is impractical for all but the simplest CRDTs<br>- Internal data structure grows linearly with the number of replicas<br>- Harder to accommodate replicas that come in and out of the network</p></div><h2 id="operation-based-crdts-commutative-crdts">Operation-based CRDTs (Commutative CRDTs)</h2><p>Current practical implementations of CRDTs opt for a way to ship smaller pieces of data over the wire while retaining the same properties as a state-based CRDT. We will give up a merge function and instead use a defined set of operations that can be used on the state. It's akin to defining <a href="https://guide.elm-lang.org/effects/">a command in an effect system</a>. Like before, the operations will need to be constrained to give us the property of uncoordinated syncing between replicas. The operations will need to be both commutative and associative, but unlike the merge function, they do not have to be idempotent.</p><p>Without idempotency, the syncing protocol now cannot just be an out-of-order delivery of updates like in state-based CRDTs. Instead, we require the operations to be delivered in causal order. When a replica syncs and catches up to the latest state, the operations are applied in causal order. Any concurrent operations will result in the same state, due to the commutative and associative properties of the operations. We're shifting part of the complexity of the merge function into the sync protocol.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Our internal bookkeeping to converge to the same state with concurrent operations doesn't use vector clocks. Instead, we can keep a log of the causal history of all the operations that occurred. Our internal bookkeeping no longer grows with the number of replicas, but instead with the number of events. </p><p>Op-based CRDTs can scale easily with the number of replicas and with an unknown number of replicas that come in and out of the network easily. However, like blockchains, it has an ever-growing internal bookkeeping if it wants to allow any replica to sync regardless of how long it has been offline.</p><p>There are two ways to address this ever-growing bookkeeping. One or the other may be feasible depending on the requirements of your application. </p><p>The first is to adopt what accountants do: close books at the end of every month and quarter. All replicas keep a rolling window of the latest N days of data and throw away data that's older than N days. And if a replica has been offline longer than a certain number of days, then they cannot be expected to sync and will need to reload from the latest. </p><p>The second is to keep all the history, but find ways to compress it. This is what the CRDT library <a href="https://youtu.be/x7drE24geUw?si=syBk3NTxeDQekk30&amp;t=3201">Automerge does</a>. This can sound like a bad idea, but we already have software that keeps its entire history around that developers use every day: <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-Objects">Git</a>. Of course, not all application requirements allow us to do this, but in my opinion, we don't do enough of it. Disks are comparatively cheap now, and the <a href="https://interjectedfuture.com/persistent-data-structure-redux/">benefits of immutability</a> far outweigh the downsides.</p><p>To query for the value of an op-based CRDT, we can apply all operations from the history log to an empty state to get the current state. Alternatively, we can keep a cache of the latest state in memory and update it on every operation.</p><div><p>💡</p><p>- Applies operations to converge state<br>- Operations need to be commutative and associative<br>- Internal data structure needs to be monotonically increasing</p></div><div><p>👍</p><p>- Small amount of data sent over the network to sync<br>- Easier to accommodate replicas that come in and out of the network<br>- Data is immutable, hence diffs, undos, and comparisons are easy.</p></div><div><p>👎</p><p>- Syncing protocol needs to implement causal delivery of operations <br>- Internal data structure is a history of operations that grows linearly with the number of operations</p></div><h2 id="delta-state-crdts">Delta-state CRDTs</h2><p>Delta-state CRDTs try to solve the data-over-the-wire problem differently. Instead of breaking the merge function into operations to send over the wire, we try to calculate the minimum amount of state to send to other replicas to sync.</p><p>There are two versions of delta-state CRDTs. In the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.2803.pdf">first δ-state CRDT paper</a>, we do something similar to op-based CRDTs: we create a set of operations, called delta-mutators) that are used to update the state. But instead of sending these operations over the wire, delta-mutators generate a diff between the states before the delta-mutator was applied and after it was applied. The diff is then stored in a buffer to be sent out to all other replicas. </p><p>But this buffer isn't a queue. The buffer holds the diff between the current state and the state when the buffer was last sent to other replicas. This is possible because the delta-mutator diffs are composable. This means if we have two diffs, d<sub>12</sub> (a diff between State X<sub>1</sub> and State X<sub>2</sub>) and d<sub>23</sub> (a diff between State X<sub>2</sub> and State X<sub>3</sub>), the composition of the two diffs would be D<sub>13</sub> (computed with d<sub>12</sub> ⨆ d<sub>23</sub>). Hence, the application of d<sub>12</sub> and then d<sub>23</sub> is the same as the application of the composition D<sub>13</sub>. The paper calls these compositions, delta-groups. </p><p>And because the diffs exist in the same join-semilattice as the states, you can use the same merge function to merge the diffs received from other replicas into your own local state.</p><p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230607175939/https://novasys.di.fct.unl.pt/~alinde/publications/a12-van_der_linde.pdf">second Δ-state paper</a> takes a slightly different approach. While the 𝛿-state CRDT has a replica send the same diff to all other replicas, in the Δ-state CRDT, we notice that the information about which replica has which part of the state is already encoded in the vector clock internal bookkeeping of the CRDTs. Hence, we can tailor the diff that we send to each replica. Therefore, we can toss the buffer and calculate the exact diff of the state that another replica needs. But by trading off the buffer, you now need to keep track of tombstones.</p><p>Delta-CRDTs retain the idempotency property of state-based CRDTs but do not require lots of bandwidth to sync replicas. </p><div><p>💡</p><p>- Merge either full state or deltas to converge<br>- Merge function needs to be commutative, associative, and idempotent<br>- Internal data structure needs to be monotonically increasing</p></div><div><p>👍</p><p>- Small amount of data sent over the network to sync<br>- Syncing protocol is simple and just needs to broadcast to all other replicas</p></div><div><p>👎</p><p>- Internal data structure grows with the number of replicas<br>- Internal data structure can get complex, like using <a href="https://www.bartoszsypytkowski.com/optimizing-state-based-crdts-part-2/">Dots</a>.<br>- Merge function implementation can get complex.</p></div><h2 id="the-search-continues">The Search Continues</h2><p>While all of these CRDTs have strengths and weaknesses, I'm looking for something where I don't have to compromise.

<p><img title="Blue steps" src="https://www.solvermax.com/images/blog/crossword/blue-steps.png" alt="Blue steps" width="300" height="180"></p>
<p>In our <a title="Optimal but not practical - Virtual machine" href="https://www.solvermax.com/blog/optimal-but-not-practical-virtual-machine">previous article</a>, we solved a mixed integer linear program (MILP) model with more than 8 million binary variables. Not long ago, a model of that size would have been unsolvable. Yet, once we had a computer with sufficient memory, the model was solved to optimality by an open source solver in 3 hours.</p>
<p>Of course, not all large models are solvable – even some small models are unsolvable, or at least hard to solve. Nonetheless, modern solvers, in association with modern computers, enable us to solve models that not-so-long-ago were beyond our capabilities.</p>
<p>In our next article, we'll look to compile crosswords using a MILP model. We're not the first to consider using a MILP model to compile crosswords. An article published in 1989 reported attempts to compile small crosswords using MILP models. The article's conclusion was very pessimistic, noting that:</p>
<blockquote><p>...the prospects of using integer programming for any type of puzzle of realistic size and with a substantial lexicon remain bleak.</p><span>Wilson, 1989, <a title="Crossword compilation using integer programming" href="https://academic.oup.com/comjnl/article-pdf/32/3/273/947308/320273.pdf">Crossword compilation using integer programming</a></span></blockquote>
<p>The problems Wilson encountered were insufficient computer memory and the time needed to solve a very small crossword grid, even though he was using a then state-of-the-art million dollar superminicomputer.</p>
<p>But a lot has changed in the 35 years since 1989. Computer hardware is many times faster, and memory capacity has increased enormously. In addition, optimization solver software has improved by orders of magnitude. Models that were difficult to solve in 1989 are now trivial. Solutions that were impossible to find in 1989 may now be within reach.</p>
<p>In this article, we estimate the magnitude of speed improvement for optimization solvers and computer hardware in the 35 years from 1989 to 2024. The results may be surprising.</p>
<h2>1989: Crossword compilation using integer programming</h2>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>As a motivating example, we consider an early attempt to compile crosswords using a mixed integer linear program (MILP). The paper <a title="Crossword compilation using integer programming" href="https://academic.oup.com/comjnl/article-pdf/32/3/273/947308/320273.pdf">Crossword compilation using integer programming</a>, was published in 1989 by J. M. Wilson. That article proposes two MILP model formulations for compiling crosswords:</p>
<figure>
<figcaption>Figure 2. Prime 750 superminicomputer</figcaption>
<img title="Prime 750 superminicomputer" src="https://www.solvermax.com/images/blog/crossword/prime750.jpg" alt="Prime 750 superminicomputer" width="468" height="400">

</figure>
<ul>
<li>Model 1, whole words. Model 1 attempts to fit whole words into a 4x4 fully interlocking puzzle (i.e. no black cells), as shown in Figure 1. With a lexicon of 100 4-letter words, the problem size was 800 variables and 524 constraints. A solution for this 4x4 <a title="double word square" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_square#Double_word_squares">double word square</a> puzzle was found in 1,800 seconds.</li>
<li>Model 2, individual letters. Model 2 attempts to place individual letters into a grid. It is more memory-efficient than Model 1, but it failed to find any solutions within 3,000 seconds, even for very small grids. In any case, Model 2 has a loose formulation that can create "words" that are not in the lexicon, so a solution (if found) may not be valid.</li>
</ul>
<p>From Wilson's experience, we observe that:</p>
<ul>
<li>A key modelling issue was memory usage, especially as the lexicon size increases. The models used a lexicon of 100 words, which is very limiting given that there are several thousand 4-letter English words.</li>
<li>Solutions were difficult to find, even for very small grids.</li>
<li>A model with 800 variables and 524 constraints is now considered to be small. In 1989 it was a large model.</li>
<li>Dense American-style puzzles (like Figure 1) are much harder to solve than sparser British-style crossword puzzles. This is likely because a dense grid has more word intersections. We'll explore this issue further in our next article.</li>
<li>The modelling was performed on a <a title="Prime 750 superminicomputer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Computer">Prime 750 superminicomputer</a>, an example of which is shown in Figure 2. The Prime 750 superminicomputer had up to 8 MB of RAM and it ran at 1 million instructions per second (MIPS). The Prime 750 was a state-of-the-art computer at the time. Depending on configuration, a <a title="THE EXECUTIVE COMPUTER; A Chip With Supercomputer Power" href="https://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/05/business/the-executive-computer-a-chip-with-supercomputer-power.html">system cost several hundred thousand US dollars</a> in the mid to late 1980s. That equates to about US\$1,000,000 today, <a title="U.S. Inflation Calculator" href="https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/">adjusted for inflation</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Wilson's paper refers to <a title="Crossword compilation with Horn clauses" href="https://academic.oup.com/comjnl/article/30/2/183/404335">another paper</a> that uses a lexicon of 1,000 4-letter words to compile crosswords using first-order predicate logic in the Prolog programming language, noting that, "This size of lexicon would present an almost impossible task for an integer programming model."</p>
<p>Overall, Wilson was pessimistic about using integer programming for compiling crosswords, considering it to be impractical, concluding that "the prospects of using integer programming for any type of puzzle of realistic size and with a substantial lexicon remain bleak".</p>
<p>So, integer programming was not a viable method for compiling crossword puzzles in 1989. But a lot has changed since then.</p>
<h2>Computers and solvers have improved enormously</h2>
<p>Wilson's paper was published in 1989. As we write this article in early 2024, that's 35 years ago. Since 1989, computers have become much faster, and they have a lot more memory. In addition, linear programming solvers have improved in both speed and sophistication.</p>
<p>In the following sections we attempt to estimate the magnitude of improvement in the 35 years since 1989.</p>
<h2>Computer improvements</h2>
<h3>Computer speed improvement: 1989-2024</h3>
<p>Computer processing speed has increased enormously over time. According to the <a title="50 years of microprocessor trend data" href="https://github.com/karlrupp/microprocessor-trend-data">50 years of microprocessor trend</a> data shown in Figure 3, single-thread Computer Processing Unit (CPU) performance (using the <a title="SpecINT benchmark" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPECint">SpecINT benchmark</a>) improved from an average score of 67 in 1988-1989 to 105,300 in 2021. That equates to a factor of 1,572 times faster.</p>
<p>From 2021 to 2023, <a title="CPU single thread benchmark scores" href="https://www.cpubenchmark.net/singleThread.html">CPU single thread benchmark scores</a> improved by a further 10%, for a total factor from 1989 to 2023 of 1,729 times faster.</p>
<figure>
<figcaption>Figure 3. 50 years of microprocessor trend data</figcaption>
<img title="50 years of microprocessor trend data" src="https://www.solvermax.com/images/blog/crossword/cpu.png" alt="50 years of microprocessor trend data" width="769" height="446">
</figure>
<p>Until 2004, almost all CPUs had a single processing core. Since then, the number of logical CPU cores (i.e., physical cores and/or parallel threads within a physical core) has been increasing. A typical desktop computer now has at least several cores, with many having one or two dozen cores. Some CPUs have hundreds of cores. Graphics card GPUs typically have thousands of cores, though that is a different story.</p>
<p>Many solvers can use multiple CPU cores, to a greater or lesser extent. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><a title="Gurobi" href="https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/current/refman/threads.html">Gurobi</a> and <a title="CPLEX" href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/icos/22.1.1?topic=parameters-parallel-mode-switch">CPLEX</a> use multiple cores, by default, when solving models.</li>
<li>The <a title="Octeract" href="https://octeract.gg/octeract-engine/">Octeract solver engine</a> relies on parallel processing for its high performance in solving non-linear models.</li>
<li>The open-source <a title="HiGHS" href="https://ergo-code.github.io/HiGHS/dev/parallel/#Future-plans">HiGHS</a> solver has "limited opportunities for exploiting parallel computing", though greater use of multiple CPU cores is planned soon.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, the speed improvement for multiple cores compared with a single core, according to <a title="Amdahl's law" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl%27s_law">Amdahl's law</a>, is generally much less than a linear multiple of the number of cores.</p>
<p>For this analysis, we make the sweeping assumption that using multiple CPUs somewhat more than doubles the performance of a single CPU. That is, we estimate that total computer processing speed increased by a factor of about 4,000 times (= 2.3 x 1,729) from 1989 to 2024.</p>
<h3>Computers have a lot more memory</h3>
<p>The Prime 750 superminicomputer used by Wilson could have up to 8 MB of RAM (though some installations had only 2 or 4 MB of RAM). A modern desktop PC may have 8 GB of RAM – i.e., 1,024 times as much memory.</p>
<p>Though 8 GB of RAM is quite small for a computer in 2024. For example, the virtual machine we used in <a title="Optimal but not practical - Virtual machine" href="https://www.solvermax.com/blog/optimal-but-not-practical-virtual-machine">our previous article</a> has 128 GB of RAM – that's 16,384 times the maximum memory available in a million dollar computer in 1989.</p>
<p>Computer memory in 2024 is also many times faster than it was in 1989. We assume that the memory speed does not materially change our estimate of CPU speed increase.</p>
<h3>Computer costs has plummeted</h3>
<p>In this analysis, we're comparing a 1989 superminicomputer with a 2024 desktop PC – because those are the machines that would typically be used for optimization modelling in their respective eras. But this is not an entirely fair comparison, as the superminicomputer cost a million dollars (in today's money), while a high specification desktop computer now costs only a few thousand dollars – a reduction of more than 99%. If we maintained cost parity, then the performance of a 2024 computer would be even greater.</p>
<h3>Summary of computer hardware improvements</h3>
<p>Compared with 35 years ago, computers are thousands of times faster, with thousands of times more memory, and their cost has fallen by more than 99%.</p>
<h2>Solver improvements</h2>
<h3>Our estimate is based on aggregating separate estimates for periods of time</h3>
<p>The best estimate we can find of how much optimization solvers have improved is published by Gurobi. We start with an analysis by Gurobi estimating the <a title="Computation progress in linear and mixed integer programming" href="https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/read/54431495/computational-progress-in-linear-and-mixed-integer-programming">computation progress in linear and mixed integer programming</a> from 1991 to 2008. We then look at an updated analysis to 2020, which we extend to 2023.</p>
<h3>CPLEX performance improvement: 1991 to 2008</h3>
<figure>
<figcaption>Figure 4. CPLEX speed improvement for MILP from 1991 to 2008</figcaption>
<img title="CPLEX speed improvement" src="https://www.solvermax.com/images/blog/crossword/cplex-speedup.png" alt="CPLEX speed improvement" width="664" height="359">
</figure>
<p>Figure 4 shows Gurobi's assessment of speed improvement for the CPLEX solver when solving MILP models, for each major software version (bars) and cumulative (line), from 1991 to 2008.</p>
<p>The total cumulative speed improvement is a factor of almost 30,000 times faster (note the log scale for the right-hand axis).</p>
<p>Over those 17 years, this equates to about 1.8 times faster per annum, on average. Though improvements don't occur at a steady rate, with especially large improvements occurring in CPLEX versions 2.1-3.0 (inclusion of the dual simplex method) and in CPLEX versions 6.0-6.5 (many improvements gleaned from "mining" the academic literature).</p>
<p>Importantly, this estimate is just the improvement in solver software performance, not allowing for the speed increase of computer hardware over the same period.</p>
<p>Note that we ignore any improvement in solver performance from 1989 to 1991, as we don't have that information. But if the same rate of improvement (1.8 times per annum) had occurred in those 3 years, then we would have another factor of almost 6 times faster.</p>
<h3>Gurobi performance improvement: 2009 to 2023</h3>
<p>Dr. Bixby, one of the founders of Gurobi, presented an <a title="Optimization: Past, Present, Future with Dr. Robert Bixby" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R8-nt5NyiE">updated analysis</a> of solver performance improvement in 2021, as shown in Figure 5.</p>
<figure>
<figcaption>Figure 5. Gurobi speed improvement for MILP from 2009 to 2020</figcaption>
<img title="Gurobi speed improvement" src="https://www.solvermax.com/images/blog/crossword/bixby-2021.png" alt="Gurobi speed improvement" width="639" height="348">
</figure>
<p>The figure states a cumulative improvement factor of 3,730,625 times, from CPLEX 1.2 to Gurobi 9.1 (released in 2020). Given the CPLEX improvement factor of 29,530 above, this implies an additional improvement for Gurobi of 126 times for the period 2009 to 2020.</p>
<p>Subsequent versions of Gurobi claim performance improvements for MILP models of:</p>
<ul>
<li><a title="Version 9.1 to 9.5" href="https://www.gurobi.com/wp-content/uploads/9.5-launch-Presentation.pdf">Version 9.1 to 9.5 (2021)</a>: 15%</li>
<li><a title="Version 9.5 to 10.0" href="https://www.gurobi.com/whats-new-gurobi-10-0/">Version 9.5 to 10.0 (2022)</a>: 13%</li>
<li><a title="Version 10.0 to 11.0" href="https://www.gurobi.com/whats-new-gurobi-11-0/">Version 10.0 to 11.0 (2023)</a>: 8.6%</li>
</ul>
<p>Combining these changes, we estimate that from 2009 to 2023 the Gurobi solver's speed improved by a factor of about 178 times.</p>
<p>A factor of 178 over 14 years equates to an average rate of about 1.45 times per annum. This is lower than the 1.8 times annual average rate from 1991 to 2009, but it is still impressive nonetheless.</p>
<h3>Solver performance improvement: 1989 to 2024</h3>
<p>Overall, by combining each of the solver-related steps above, we can estimate the cumulative improvement in solver performance over the last 35 years.</p>
<p>The result is that MILP solver performance improved by a factor of 5 million times (in round numbers) from 1989 to 2024. This is conservative estimate, as we exclude any improvement that may have occurred from 1989 to 1991, and from 2023 to 2024.</p>
<p>This improvement, assuming the same computer hardware, is equivalent to a model that takes 60 seconds to solve in 2023 taking 10 years to solve if started in 1989. That is, if it was possible to solve at all in 1989.</p>
<p>Note that our solver performance increase estimate is based on the commercial solvers CPLEX and Gurobi. An open-source solver, like HiGHS, is generally not as fast as CPLEX or Gurobi – perhaps by an order of magnitude, more-or-less, depending on the model. Though that hardly seems significant, given the magnitude of speed improvements over the past three+ decades.</p>
<h2>Solver + computer performance improvement: 1989 to 2024</h2>
<figure>
<figcaption>20 billion times faster</figcaption>
<p>Solving MILP models is about 20 billion times faster than it was 35 years ago.</p>
</figure>
<h3>Combined result</h3>
<p>Combining the computer hardware speed increase of 4,000 times with the solver software performance improvement of 5 million times, the total improvement from 1989 to 2024 is a factor of 20 billion times faster!</p>
<p>At that rate, a model that takes 60 seconds to solve in 2023 would have taken 38,000 years to solve if started in 1989.</p>
<h3>A grain of salt</h3>
<p>Of course, we shouldn't take these estimates too literally.</p>
<p>Firstly, there's substantial room for variation in our estimates. Some numbers are uncertain, while others are simply guesses. Also, aggregating the various factors in a multiplicative manner may not be entirely valid.</p>
<p>Secondly, there are many elements that contribute to how fast, or even whether, a MILP model can be solved, in addition to computer and solver raw speed. Other elements include memory size, programming language features, the fit between solver methodology and a model's specific characteristics, and changes in solver features.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the magnitude of speed increases we've described in this article surely help in solving larger, more difficult MILP models. A lot.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In this article, we estimate the speed improvement in computer hardware and optimization solver software since 1989. This assessment is motivated by an academic paper by Wilson, published 35 years ago, describing an attempt to compile crossword puzzles using mixed integer linear programming (MILP). That attempt was largely unsuccessful, as the task was beyond the capability of MILP solvers at that time.</p>
<p>But both computers and MILP solvers have advanced enormously since 1989 – by a combined factor of around 20 billion time faster! That improvement should be enough to offset at least some of Wilson's pessimism about being able to compile crossword puzzles using MILP models. Likewise for many other optimization models.</p>
<p>In the next article, we attempt to formulate and solve a MILP to compile crossword puzzles. This is still a difficult problem, though given the improvement in computer and solver speed, there is some basis for optimism that the task is now possible.</p>

I’m sure not very many people would understand how large this work. It started
so many years ago that I don’t even know how long I’ve been working on it.
Definitely years and not just 1 or 2. I remember that before I joined the OpenBSD community,
Vadim Zhukov did a lot of work in the Qt/KDE area. In the early days, it was
good to have someone to talk to, or just to know “you’re not alone”. This has
not been the case for a long time.  I’ve been doing it alone for years, just
like Vadim did it alone for years. It’s probably the burden of the project, we
are a super small team of OpenBSD kernel and ports developers.</p>
<p>It should be mentioned that last year kn@ - Klemens Nanni helped with a lot of
reviews and thus made it possible that we have KDE as packages.</p>
<p>I’m beginning to wonder as I write. What happens now? What happen next? Do I
have plans? Sure I could just continue to maintain the whole thing.
What will definitely be interesting is the KDE switch from Qt5 to Qt6. This
should not be a big challenge for OpenBSD. All dependencies like all Qt6
modules are ported. So this will just be a task of hard work.</p>
<p>Here are some thoughts on what we could work on.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/openbsd/ports/blob/master/meta/kde/pkg/README-plasma#L91" target="_blank">
    Fix KWin compositor</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/openbsd/ports/blob/master/meta/kde/pkg/README-plasma#L68" target="_blank">

<li><a href="https://networkmanager.dev/docs/libnm/latest/" target="_blank">

<li><a href="https://apps.kde.org/discover/" target="_blank">

</ul>
<p>Perhaps it is normal that after such a big achievement, a period of reflection
begins. Let us be surprised what 2024 will bring.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><section><main><p>I've always found distributed systems to be the most fascinating branch of
computer science. I think the reason is that distributed systems are subject to
the rules of the physical world just like we are. Things are never perfect, you
cannot get everything you want, you’re always limited by physics, and often by
economics, or by who you can communicate with. Many problems in distributed
systems simply do not have a clean solution, instead there are different
trade-offs you can make.</p>
<p>While at Citus Data, Microsoft, and now Crunchy Data, the focus of my work has
been on distributed PostgreSQL architectures. At the last
<a href="http://pgconf.eu/">PGConf.EU</a> in December, I gave a talk titled
“<a href="https://www.postgresql.eu/events/pgconfeu2023/sessions/session/4826-postgresql-distributed-architectures-best-practices/">PostgreSQL Distributed: Architectures &amp; Best Practices</a>”
where I went over various kinds of distributed PostgreSQL architectures that
I’ve encountered over the years.</p>
<p>Many distributed database discussions focus on algorithms for distributed query
planning, transactions, etc. These are very interesting topics, but the truth is
that only a small part of my time as a distributed database engineer goes into
algorithms, and an excessive amount of time goes into making very careful
trade-offs at every level (and of course, failure handling, testing, fixing
bugs). Similarly, what many users notice within the first few minutes of using a
distributed database is how unexpectedly slow they can be, because you quickly
start hitting performance trade-offs.</p>
<p>There are many types of distributed PostgreSQL architectures, and they each make
a different set of trade-offs. Let’s go over some of these architectures.</p>
<h2 id="single-machine-postgresql"><a href="#single-machine-postgresql">Single machine PostgreSQL</a></h2>
<p>To set the stage for discussing distributed PostgreSQL architectures, we first
need to understand a bit about the simplest possible architecture: running
PostgreSQL on a single machine, or "node".</p>
<p>PostgreSQL on a single machine can be incredibly fast. There’s virtually no
network latency on the database layer and you can even co-locate your
application server. Millions of IOPS are available depending on the machine
configuration. Disk latency is measured in microseconds. In general, running
PostgreSQL on a single machine is a performant and cost-efficient choice.</p>
<p>So why doesn’t everyone just use a single machine?</p>
<p>Many companies do. However, PostgreSQL on a single machine comes with
operational hazards. If the machine fails, there’s inevitably some kind of
downtime. If the disk fails, you’re likely facing some data loss. An overloaded
system can be difficult to scale. And you’re limited to the storage size of a
disk, which when full will cease to process and store data. That very low
latency and efficiency clearly comes at a price.</p>
<p>Distributed PostgreSQL architectures are ultimately trying to address the
operational hazards of a single machine in different ways. In doing so, they do
lose some of its efficiency, and especially the low latency.</p>
<h2 id="goals-of-a-distributed-database-architecture"><a href="#goals-of-a-distributed-database-architecture">Goals of a Distributed Database Architecture</a></h2>
<p>The goal of a distributed database architecture is to try to meet the
availability, durability, performance, regulatory, and scale requirements of
large organizations, subject the physics. The ultimate goal is to do so with the
same rich functionality and precise transactional semantics as a single node
RDBMS.</p>
<p>There are several mechanisms that distributed database systems employ to achieve
this, namely:</p>
<ul>
<li>Replication - Place copies of data on different machines</li>
<li>Distribution - Place partitions of data on different machines</li>
<li>Decentralization - Place different DBMS activities on different machines</li>
</ul>
<p>In practice, each of these mechanisms inherently comes with concessions in terms
of performance, transactional semantics, functionality, and/or operational
complexity.</p>
<p>To get a nice thing, you’ll have to give up a nice thing, but there are many
different combinations of what you can get and what you need to give up.</p>
<h2 id="the-importance-of-latency-in-oltp-systems"><a href="#the-importance-of-latency-in-oltp-systems">The importance of latency in OLTP systems</a></h2>
<p>Of course, distributed systems have already taken over the world, and most of
the time we don’t really need to worry a lot about trade-offs when using them.
Why would distributed <em>database</em> systems be any different?</p>
<p>The difference lies in a combination of storing the authoritative state for the
application, the rich functionality that an RDBMS like PostgreSQL offers, and
the relatively high impact of latency on client-perceived performance in OLTP
systems.</p>
<p>PostgreSQL, like most other RDBMSs, uses a synchronous, interactive protocol
where transactions are performed step-by-step. The client waits for the database
to answer before sending the next command, and the next command might depend on
the answer to the previous.</p>
<p>Any network latency between client and database server will already be a
noticeable factor in the overall duration of a transaction. When PostgreSQL
itself is a distributed system that makes internal network round trips (e.g.
while waiting for WAL commit), the duration can get many times higher.</p>
<p><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/lPM0ntuwQfh8VQgJRu0mFg/41566cae-dec8-4d8d-9b32-a8c23cb70200/public" alt="latency diagram" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>Why is it bad for transactions to take longer? Surely humans won’t notice if
they need to wait 10-20ms? Well, if transactions take on average 20ms, then a
single (interactive) session can only do 50 transactions per second. You then
need a lot of concurrent sessions to actually achieve high throughput.</p>
<p>Having many sessions is not always practical from the application point-of-view,
and each session uses significant resources like memory on the database server.
Most PostgreSQL set ups limit the maximum number of sessions in the hundreds or
low thousands, which puts a hard limit on achievable transaction throughput when
network latency is involved. In addition, any operation that is holding locks
while waiting for network round trips is also going to affect the achievable
concurrency.</p>
<p><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/lPM0ntuwQfh8VQgJRu0mFg/f094a883-daa1-4a52-caa5-5590bce9fe00/public" alt="connections and processes diagram" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>While in theory, latency does not have to affect performance so much, in
practice it almost always does. The CIDR ‘23 paper
<a href="https://www.cidrdb.org/cidr2023/papers/p50-ziegler.pdf">“Is Scalable OLTP in the Cloud a solved problem?”</a>
gives a nice discussion of the issue of latency in section 2.5.</p>
<h2 id="postgresql-distributed-architectures"><a href="#postgresql-distributed-architectures">PostgreSQL Distributed Architectures</a></h2>
<p>PostgreSQL can be distributed at many different layers that hook into different
parts of its own architecture and make different trade-offs. In the following
sections, we will discuss these well-known architectures:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Network-attached block storage</strong> (e.g. EBS)</li>
<li><strong>Read replicas</strong></li>
<li><strong>DBMS-optimized cloud storage</strong> (e.g. Aurora)</li>
<li><strong>Active-active</strong> (e.g. BDR)</li>
<li><strong>Transparent Sharding</strong> (e.g. Citus)</li>
<li><strong>Distributed key-value stores with SQL</strong> (e.g. Yugabyte)</li>
</ul>
<p>We will describe the pros and cons of each architecture, relative to running
PostgreSQL on a single machine.</p>
<p>Note that many of these architectures are orthogonal. For instance, you could
have a sharded system with read replicas using network-attached storage, or an
active-active system that uses DBMS-optimized cloud storage.</p>
<h3 id="network-attached-block-storage"><a href="#network-attached-block-storage">Network-attached block storage</a></h3>
<p>Network-attached block storage is a common technique in cloud-based
architectures where the database files are stored on a different device. The
database server typically runs in a virtual machine in a Hypervisor, which
exposes a block device to the VM. Any reads and writes to the block device will
result in network calls to a block storage API. The block storage service
internally replicates the writes to 2-3 storage nodes.</p>
<p><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/lPM0ntuwQfh8VQgJRu0mFg/4cd769ee-098e-4f1e-072c-1b15dcfcb500/public" alt="Network-attached block storage architecture in the cloud" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>Practically all managed PostgreSQL services use network-attached block devices
because the benefits are critical to most organizations. The internal
replication results in high durability and also allows the block storage service
to remain available when a storage node fails. The data is stored separately
from the database server, which means the database server can easily be
respawned on a different machine in case of failure, or when scaling up/down.
Finally, the disk itself is easily resizable and supports snapshots for fast
backups and creating replicas.</p>
<p>Getting so many nice things does come at a significant performance cost. Where
modern Nvme drives generally achieve over &gt;1M IOPS and disk latency in the tens
of microseconds, network-attached storage is often below 10K IOPS and &gt;1ms disk
latency, especially for writes. That is a ~2 order of magnitude difference.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Higher durability (replication)</li>
<li>Higher uptime (replace VM, reattach)</li>
<li>Fast backups and replica creation (snapshots)</li>
<li>Disk is resizable</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Higher disk latency (~20μs -&gt; ~1000μs)</li>
<li>Lower IOPS (~1M -&gt; ~10k IOPS)</li>
<li>Crash recovery on restart takes time</li>
<li>Cost can be high</li>
</ul>
<p>💡 <strong>Guideline</strong>: the durability and availability benefits of network-attached
storage usually outweigh the performance downsides, but it’s worth keeping in
mind that PostgreSQL can be much faster.</p>
<h3 id="read-replicas"><a href="#read-replicas">Read replicas</a></h3>
<p>PostgreSQL has built-in support for physical replication to read-only replicas.
The most common way of using a replica is to set it up as a hot standby that
takes over when the primary fails in a
<a href="https://www.crunchydata.com/blog/database-terminology-explained-postgres-high-availability-and-disaster-recovery">high availability set up</a>.
There are many blogs, books, and talks describing the trade-offs of high
availability set ups, so in this post I will focus on other architectures.</p>
<p>Another common use for read replicas is to help you scale read throughput when
reads are CPU or I/O bottlenecked by load balancing queries across replicas,
which achieves linear scalability of reads and also offloads the primary, which
speeds up writes!</p>
<p><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/lPM0ntuwQfh8VQgJRu0mFg/67558330-e428-41c2-a876-3d6fe88ba000/public" alt="read replica diagram" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>A challenge with read replicas is that there is no prescribed way of using them.
You have to decide on the topology and how you query them, and in doing so you
will be making distributed systems trade-offs yourself.</p>
<p>The primary usually does not wait for replication when committing a write, which
means read replicas are always slightly behind. That can become an issue when
your application does a read that, from the user’s perspective, depends on a
write that happened earlier. For example, a user clicks “Add to cart”, which
adds the item to the shopping cart and immediately sends the user to the
shopping cart page. If reading the shopping cart contents happens on the read
replica, the shopping cart might then appear empty. Hence, you need to be very
careful about which reads use a read replica.</p>
<p><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/lPM0ntuwQfh8VQgJRu0mFg/646e4756-c11e-49e8-c4b3-b6b139e32900/public" alt="digram of inserts lagging behind a read replica" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>Even if reads do not directly depend on a preceding write, at least from the
client perspective, there may still be strange time travel anomalies. When load
balancing between different nodes, clients might repeatedly get connected to
different replica and see a different state of the database. As distributed
systems engineers, we say that there is no “monotonic read consistency”.</p>
<p>Another issue with read replicas is that, when queries are load balanced
randomly, they will each have similar cache contents. While that is great when
there are certain extremely hot queries, it becomes painful when the frequently
read data (working set) no longer fits in memory and each read replica will be
performing a lot of redundant I/O. In contrast, a sharded architecture would
divide the data over the memory and avoid I/O.</p>
<p>Read replicas are a powerful tool for scaling reads, but you should consider
whether your workload is really appropriate for it.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Read throughput scales linearly</li>
<li>Low latency stale reads if read replica is closer than primary</li>
<li>Lower load on primary</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Eventual read-your-writes consistency</li>
<li>No monotonic read consistency</li>
<li>Poor cache usage</li>
</ul>
<p>💡 <strong>Guideline:</strong> Consider using read replicas when you need &gt;100k reads/sec or
observe a CPU bottleneck due to reads, best avoided for dependent transactions
and large working sets.</p>
<h3 id="dbms-optimized-cloud-storage"><a href="#dbms-optimized-cloud-storage">DBMS-optimized cloud storage</a></h3>
<p>There are a number of cloud services now like Aurora and AlloyDB that provide a
network-attached storage layer that is optimized specifically for a DBMS.</p>
<p>In particular, a DBMS normally performs every write in two different ways:
Immediately to the write-ahead log (WAL), and in the background to a data page
(or several pages, when indexes are involved). Normally, PostgreSQL performs
both of these writes, but in the DBMS-optimized storage architecture the
background pages writes are performed by the storage layer instead, based on the
incoming WAL. This reduces the amount of write I/O on the primary node.</p>
<p><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/lPM0ntuwQfh8VQgJRu0mFg/8f4c2648-db97-40f8-1581-7d4a6ce0fa00/public" alt="diagram of dbms-optmized storage" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>The WAL is typically replicated directly from the primary node to several
availability zones to parallelize the network round trips, which increases I/O
again. Always writing to multiple availability zones also increases the write
latency, which can result in lower per-session performance. In addition, read
latency can be higher because the storage layer does not always materialize
pages in memory. Architecturally, PostgreSQL is also not optimized for these
storage characteristics.</p>
<p>While the theory behind DBMS-optimized storage is sound. In practice, the
performance benefits are often not very pronounced (and can be negative), and
the cost can be much higher than regular network-attached block storage. It does
offer a greater degree of flexibility to the cloud service provider, for
instance in terms of attach/detach times, because storage is controlled in the
data plane rather than the hypervisor.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Potential performance benefits by avoiding page writes from primary</li>
<li>Replicas can reuse storage, incl. hot standby</li>
<li>Can do faster reattach, branching than network-attached storage</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Write latency is high by default</li>
<li>High cost / pricing</li>
<li>PostgreSQL is not designed for it, not OSS</li>
</ul>
<p>💡 <strong>Guideline:</strong> Can be beneficial for complex workloads, but important to
measure whether price-performance under load is actually better than using a
bigger machine.</p>
<h3 id="active-active"><a href="#active-active">Active-active</a></h3>
<p>In the active-active architecture any node can locally accept writes without
coordination with other nodes. It is typically used with replicas in multiple
sites, each of which will then see low read and write latency, and can survive
failure of other sites. These benefits are phenomenal, but of course come with a
significant downside.</p>
<p>First, you have the typical eventual consistency downsides of read replicas.
However, the main challenge with an active-active setup is that update conflicts
are not resolved upfront. Normally, if two concurrent transactions try to update
the same row in PostgreSQL, the first one will take a “row-level lock”. In case
of active-active, both updates might be accepted concurrently.</p>
<p>For instance, when you perform two simultaneous updates of a counter on
different nodes, the nodes might both see 4 as the current value and set the new
value to 5. When replication happens, they’ll happily agree that the new value
is 5 even though there were two increment operations.</p>
<p><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/lPM0ntuwQfh8VQgJRu0mFg/627e299d-d26a-439d-cfe4-83049c73b200/public" alt="diagram of an active-active architecture" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>Active-active systems do not have a linear history, even at the row level, which
makes them very hard to program against. However, if you are very prepared to
live with that, the benefits could be attractive especially for very high
availability.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Very high read and write availability</li>
<li>Low read and write latency</li>
<li>Read throughput scales linearly</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Eventual read-your-writes consistency</li>
<li>No monotonic read consistency</li>
<li>No linear history (updates might conflict after commit)</li>
</ul>
<p>💡 <strong>General guideline:</strong> Consider only for very simple workloads (e.g. queues)
and only if you really need the benefits.</p>
<h3 id="transparent-sharding"><a href="#transparent-sharding">Transparent sharding</a></h3>
<p>Transparent sharding systems like Citus distribute tables by a shard key and/or
replicate tables across multiple primary nodes. Each node shows the distributed
tables as if they were regular PostgreSQL tables and queries &amp; transactions are
transparently routed or parallelized across nodes.</p>
<p>Data is stored in shards, which are regular PostgreSQL tables, which can take
advantage of indexes, constraints, etc. In addition, the shards can be
co-located by the shard key (in “shard groups”), such that joins and foreign
keys that include the shard key can be performed locally.</p>
<p><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/lPM0ntuwQfh8VQgJRu0mFg/1cb5e4db-c901-40e3-5327-73a5c6caa500/public" alt="transparent sharding diagram" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>The advantage of distributing the data this way is that you can take advantage
of the memory, IO bandwidth, storage, and CPU of all the nodes in an efficient
manner. You could even ensure that your data or at least your working set always
fits in memory by scaling out.</p>
<p>Scaling out transactional workloads is most effective when queries have a filter
on the shard key, such that they can be routed to a single shard group (e.g.
single tenant in a
<a href="https://www.crunchydata.com/blog/designing-your-postgres-database-for-multi-tenancy">multi-tenant app</a>).
That way, there is only a marginal amount of overhead compared to running a
query on a single server, but you have a lot more capacity. Another effective
way of scaling out is when you have compute-heavy analytical queries that can be
parallelized across the shards (e.g.
<a href="https://www.crunchydata.com/blog/postgres-citus-partman-your-iot-database">time series / IoT</a>).</p>
<p>However, there is also higher latency, which reduces the per-session throughput
compared to a single machine. And, if you have a simple lookup that does not
have a shard key filter, you will still experience all the overhead of
parallelizing the query across nodes. Finally, there may be restrictions in
terms of data model (e.g. unique and foreign constraints must include shard
key), SQL (non-co-located correlated subqueries), and transactional guarantees
(snapshot isolation only at shard level).</p>
<p>Using a sharded system often means that you will need to adjust your application
to deal with higher latency and a more rigid data model. For instance, if you
are building a
<a href="https://docs.citusdata.com/en/stable/get_started/tutorial_multi_tenant.html">multi-tenant application</a>
you will need to add tenant ID columns to all your tables to use as a shard key,
and if you are currently loading data using INSERT statements then you might
want to switch to COPY to avoid waiting for every row.</p>
<p>If you are willing to adjust your application, sharding can be one of the most
powerful tools in your arsenal for dealing with data-intensive applications.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Scale throughput for reads &amp; writes (CPU &amp; IOPS)</li>
<li>Scale memory for large working sets</li>
<li>Parallelize analytical queries, batch operations</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>High read and write latency</li>
<li>Data model decisions have high impact on performance</li>
<li>Snapshot isolation concessions</li>
</ul>
<p>💡 <strong>General guideline:</strong> Use for multi-tenant apps, otherwise use for large
working set (&gt;100GB) or compute heavy queries.</p>
<h3 id="distributed-key-value-storage-with-sql"><a href="#distributed-key-value-storage-with-sql">Distributed key-value storage with SQL</a></h3>
<p>About a decade ago, Google Spanner introduced the notion of a distributed
key-value store that supports transactions across nodes (key ranges) with
snapshot isolation in a scalable manner by using globally synchronized clocks.
Subsequent evolutions of Spanner then added a SQL layer on top, and ultimately
even a PostgreSQL interface. Open source alternatives like CockroachDB and
Yugabyte followed a similar approach without the requirement of synchronized
clocks, at the cost of significantly higher latency.</p>
<p>These systems have built on top of existing key-value storage techniques for
availability and scalability, such as shard-level replication and failover using
Paxos or Raft. Tables are then stored in the key-value store, with the key being
a combination of the table ID and the primary key. The SQL engine is adjusted
accordingly, distributing queries where possible.</p>
<p><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/lPM0ntuwQfh8VQgJRu0mFg/de7bc03c-8f80-4384-383a-0d38dde0d800/public" alt="key value store diagram" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>In my view, the relational data model (or, your typical PostgreSQL app) is not
well-served by using a distributed key-value store underneath. Related tables
and indexes are not necessarily stored together, meaning typical operations such
as joins and evaluating foreign keys or even simple index lookups might incur an
excessive number of internal network hops. The relatively strong transactional
guarantees that involve additional locks and coordination can also become a drag
on performance.</p>
<p>In comparison to PostgreSQL or Citus, performance and efficiency are often
<a href="https://gigaom.com/report/transaction-processing-price-performance-testing/">disappointing</a>.
However, these systems offer much richer (PostgreSQL-like) functionality than
existing key-value stores, and better scalability than consensus stores like
etcd, so they can be a great alternative for those.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Good read and write availability (shard-level failover)</li>
<li>Single table, single key operations scale well</li>
<li>No additional data modeling steps or snapshot isolation concessions</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Many internal operations incur high latency</li>
<li>No local joins in current implementations</li>
<li>Not actually PostgreSQL, and less mature and optimized</li>
</ul>
<p>💡 <strong>General guideline:</strong> Just use PostgreSQL 😉 For simple applications, the
availability and scalability benefits can be useful.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></h2>
<p>PostgreSQL can be distributed at different layers. Each architecture can
introduce severe trade-offs. Almost nothing comes for free.</p>
<p>When deciding on the database architecture, keep asking yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li>What do I really want?</li>
<li>Which architecture achieves that?</li>
<li>What are the downsides?</li>
<li>What can my application tolerate? (can I change my application?)</li>

<p>Even with state-of-the-art tools, deploying a distributed database system is
never a solved problem, and perhaps never will be. You will need to spend some
time understanding the trade-offs. I hope this blog post will help.</p>

    </div><p>The yellowfin tuna commonly enjoyed in sashimi, poke bowls and salad sandwiches may soon disappear from these dishes if current over-exploitation rates remain unchanged, especially in the Indian Ocean.</p>


										      
																																	<p>A <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2023.106902">paper</a>, titled "Multiple lines of evidence highlight the dire straits of yellowfin <a href="https://phys.org/tags/tuna/" rel="tag">tuna</a> in the Indian Ocean," and published in <i>Ocean and Coastal Management</i> shows that since industrial exploitation started in 1950, the global biomass—the weight of a given <a href="https://phys.org/tags/population/" rel="tag">population</a> in the water—of yellowfin tuna has decreased, on average, by 54% across the four populations managed by tuna Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (RFMO). In the Indian Ocean, yellowfin tuna biomass has experienced a 70% decline in the past 70 years.</p>
<p>"If we look at more recent years, we can see that global yellowfin tuna populations continue to struggle. Biomass continues to decline everywhere except for stabilizing trends in the Western Pacific Ocean, prompted by management interventions," said Kristina Heidrich, lead author of the study and Ph.D. candidate with the Sea Around Us—Indian Ocean at the University of Western Australia (UWA).</p>
<p>"In most places, extractions have regularly surpassed the maximum sustainable yield or MSY limit, which is the level that would allow for the highest possible catches to be sustained over time, given that <a href="https://phys.org/tags/environmental+conditions/" rel="tag">environmental conditions</a> don't change much," added Dirk Zeller, co-author of the study and director of the Sea Around Us—Indian Ocean.</p>

																																						
																																			<p>To strengthen their evaluations, Heidrich and her co-authors used multiple methodologies. Since yellowfin tuna is normally assessed by RFMOs, they used the organizations' time series and assessment results of yellowfin tuna biomass to estimate its annual fluctuations from 1950 to 2020.</p>
<p>In parallel, they applied the CMSY++ approach, which relies mainly on time series of fisheries catches to assess the status of fish stocks. Finally, they analyzed 955 records of yellowfin tuna obtained from fisheries-independent sampling with Baited Remote Underwater Video Systems (BRUVS), which record biological and <a href="https://phys.org/tags/ecological+data/" rel="tag">ecological data</a> such as a species' size, biomass and how abundant it is in an area.</p>
<p>"The data collected with BRUVS provided a more holistic and fisheries-independent picture of the pelagic community and the status of the populations, which can complement fisheries-dependent data and analyses," said Jessica Meeuwig, co-author of the paper and director of UWA's Marine Futures Lab.</p>
<p>"These fisheries-independent BRUVS data suggest that, since 2014, yellowfin tuna in the Indian Ocean are the least common, least abundant, have the lowest biomass, and are the smallest yellowfin tuna in the existing dataset."</p>
<p>The CMSY++ approach, on the other hand, showed that even though yellowfin tuna exploitation rates slightly exceeded the MSY limit in the past decade in the eastern and western Pacific Ocean and in the Atlantic Ocean, these populations are not currently undergoing overfishing. That's not the case for the Indian Ocean, where overfishing is ongoing.</p>

																																			<p>"Beyond yellowfin tuna fisheries contributing more than US$16 billion to the <a href="https://phys.org/tags/global+economy/" rel="tag">global economy</a> yearly, the species is an <a href="https://phys.org/tags/apex+predator/" rel="tag">apex predator</a> that plays a critical role in the functioning, productivity and overall health of marine ecosystems," said Daniel Pauly, co-author of the study and principal investigator of the Sea Around Us initiative at the University of British Columbia.</p>
<p>"The risk of population collapse is high if current management does not adapt. Stringent management constraints must be implemented to reduce overall fishing capacity, rebuild overfished populations, and reduce the <a href="https://phys.org/tags/collateral+damage/" rel="tag">collateral damage</a> these fisheries cause to other species such as sharks."</p>
<p>The researchers note that, by using multiple lines of evidence that cross-validate each other, such as the ones they employed, management organizations can improve the confidence, transparency and accuracy of the information that guides their decisions. They also propose stricter management measures such as a reduction of fishing capacity, ensuring that the MSY limit is observed and implementing effective catch limits.</p>
<p>"In the Indian Ocean in particular, a catch reduction of 30% from 2020 levels is urgent to halt and reverse the decline in <a href="https://phys.org/tags/yellowfin+tuna/" rel="tag">yellowfin tuna</a> population," Heidrich said.</p>
