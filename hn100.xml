<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 id="heading--a-99percent-approval-rating-is-nearly-s"><b><i>A 99% approval rating is nearly s</i></b><i>tatistically</i><i><b> impossible. Apple says it gets one every year.&nbsp;</b></i></h2><p><b>Key Points:&nbsp;</b></p><ul><li><p>In its May earnings call, Apple claimed that the iPhone 14 had a 99% customer satisfaction rating citing a third party research firm it hired.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Apple has made a similar claim in every single earnings call for the past seven years.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>A customer satisfaction rating this high is nearly impossible to find using traditional survey methods and a representative sample.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Independent sources find iPhone satisfaction ratings significantly lower than what Apple claims.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Apple’s claimed iPhone satisfaction is far higher than what other consumer companies and brands claim for beloved products.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>We asked Apple’s press team to explain how the company arrived at these results. They opened our email 73 times, but didn’t respond.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Our best guess is that Apple wants to make bold customer satisfaction claims, and has hired a third-party research firm that will produce those numbers to make them seem more credible – and perhaps to provide plausible deniability.</p></li><li><p>That firm is likely using a highly unrepresentative sample of tech enthusiasts and early adopters to generate extraordinary satisfaction numbers that Apple then presents as representative of consumers generally.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>Toward the end of its earnings call in May, Apple made an extraordinary claim: “The latest survey of US Consumers from 451 Research measured customer satisfaction at 99% for the iPhone 14 family,” Apple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said.&nbsp;</p><p>The problem is a 99% satisfaction rate is so high, there’s almost no way to get it using standard survey methods and a representative sample.&nbsp;</p><p>“Even if every single person actually loved their iPhone it would still be nearly impossible to find near unanimous satisfaction using traditional survey methods,” said economist and PerfectRec founder Joe Golden. “A few percent of people just won’t understand the question, or will give the wrong response by mistake,” Golden said.&nbsp;</p><p>If Apple’s claims of 99% satisfaction were true, it would mean the iPhone 14 was not only the most popular mass market consumer product of all time, but it would also probably make it the most popular&nbsp;<i>anything of all time.&nbsp;</i>To get a sense of just how extraordinary Apple’s iPhone 14 claims were, we looked at some other satisfaction numbers and approval ratings for context.&nbsp;</p><p>America’s favorite holiday, Thanksgiving, enjoys 82% popularity according to a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1277607/most-popular-holidays-in-the-united-states/#:~:text=Thanksgiving%2C%20Memorial%20day%2C%20and%20Veterans,Veterans%20day%20with%2077%20percent."><u>2023 survey by Statista</u></a>. Memorial Day comes in second at 77%.&nbsp;</p><p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.imdb.com/chart/top/?ref_=nv_mv_250"><u>three most popular movies</u></a>&nbsp;of all time on IMDB are&nbsp;<i>The Shawshank Redemption</i>,&nbsp;<i>The Godfather</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>The Dark Knight</i>. They have ratings of 9.2, 9.2 and 9.0 respectively. </p><p>If we look at some of the most popular retailers in America, we find satisfaction ratings maxing out in the 80s. Trader Joe’s fans will stand in line for hours for groceries but still give the store just an 84%&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theacsi.org/industries/retail/supermarkets/"><u>satisfaction rating</u></a>, according to a survey by the American Customer Satisfaction Institute. 82% of Costco customers say they are&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theacsi.org/industries/retail/general-merchandise-retailers/"><u>satisfied with the retailer</u></a>, and they pay $60-120 a year for the privilege of shopping there.</p><p>What about politics where tribal loyalties tend to trump facts?&nbsp;<a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/203006/obama-job-approval-ratings-politically-polarized-far.aspx"><u>According to Gallup</u></a>, President Barack Obama enjoyed an average approval rating across his two terms of just 83%&nbsp;<i>among Democrats</i>. Donald Trump performed a bit better among Republicans while in the White House, averaging an&nbsp;<a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/203198/presidential-approval-ratings-donald-trump.aspx"><u>86% approval rating</u></a>&nbsp;from members of his own party. Even Syrian dictator Bashar Al-Asad only&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Syrian_presidential_election"><u>managed 95% support</u></a>&nbsp;in the last election, and that was condemned by the United Nations for being undemocratic.&nbsp;</p><p>In fact, the only other poll we could find claiming 99% support for&nbsp;<i>anything</i>&nbsp;was a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/is-america-still-sweet-on-ice-cream-national-survey-reveals-our-relationship-may-be-cooling-off-300488561.html#:~:text=Among%20the%20findings%3A%20While%2099,due%20to%20%22health%22%20concerns."><u>press release</u></a>&nbsp; that said 99% of Americans enjoy ice cream. It was authored by a frozen dessert company. I’d note they didn’t bother sharing methodology for such an implausible claim.&nbsp;</p><p>So what is going on with Apple’s claimed iPhone satisfaction rates? We reached out to Apple to find out, but didn’t get any response. When we kept digging, this is what we found.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="heading--third-party-sources-find-much-lower-satisfaction-rates-for-the-iphone">Third-party sources find much lower satisfaction rates for the iPhone</h2><p>Independent sources do not match Apple’s claimed satisfaction rates.&nbsp;</p><p>The American Consumer Satisfaction Institute regularly surveys consumers about cell phones and wireless carriers. Their&nbsp;<a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/05/16/iphone-beats-samsung-in-satisfaction-survey/"><u>latest survey</u></a>&nbsp;found iPhone satisfaction at 81% for 5G models and 78% for other models. That was the highest combined satisfaction rate of any smartphone manufacturer, but still a far cry from the company’s own findings through 451 Research.</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/6fetvjj0zxvn/35oovuXDQwc5z2k5OE3DZh/dee474b1b912e34dedb3c640b2828bf0/satisfaction-survey.png?fit=fill&amp;w=768" height="639" width="768" alt=""></p><p>User reviews on Google tell a similar story. People love the iPhone, but not as much as Apple claims.&nbsp;</p><p>While Apple has not published their methodology, a&nbsp;<a href="https://451research.com/images/Marketing/press_releases/iPhone-PR-1_31_2018-f.pdf?&amp;utm_campaign=2018_vocul_apple_pr&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=press_release&amp;utm_term=apple_iphone_pr"><u>2018 press release</u></a>&nbsp;about the survey from its creator, 451 Research shows at least two categories of support: “Very Satisfied” and “Somewhat Satisfied.” If Apple and 451 Research are using a traditional five-point satisfaction scale ranging from “Not At All Satisfied” to “Very Satisfied,” those responses would correspond to four and five stars respectively.&nbsp; If we map that to ratings for the iPhone on Google Reviews, which uses a five-star scale, we find that&nbsp; between 87% to 90% of users are rating the iPhone 4+ stars, depending on the model. Those are great reviews, but they are not a 99% satisfaction rate.&nbsp;</p><p>Even if you took the most favorable approach to Apple and said anything that’s not a one-star review counts as satisfied, you would still fall short of Apple’s claimed satisfaction rates. Six percent of users rate the various iPhone 14 models 1 star on Google as of July 6, 2023. That extremely generous scale would translate into a satisfaction rate of 94%, still not the 99% Apple is claiming.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="heading--when-other-consumer-companies-brag-about-satisfaction-they-cite-much-lower-numbers">When other consumer companies brag about satisfaction, they cite much lower numbers&nbsp;</h2><p>An analysis of dozens of earnings call transcripts show that executives are usually extremely cautious about satisfaction claims.&nbsp;</p><p>Companies love talking about how happy their customers are, but in the context of heavily scrutinized public earnings calls, they tend to keep their remarks extremely vague. When the word “satisfaction” is used at all, it’s usually part of broad statements like Disney CEO Bob Iger pledging to “<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4576588-walt-disney-company-dis-q1-2023-earnings-call-transcript"><u>increase park capacity while preserving guest satisfaction</u></a>.”&nbsp;</p><p>We combed through the last four quarters of earnings transcripts from consumer favorites like Costco, Disney and McDonald’s as well as popular electronics companies like Samsung and Sony, for claims about customer satisfaction. The only quantitative claim we found was Sony touting that the PlayStation Plus subscription service enjoyed 72% customer satisfaction in a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/irday/pdf/2022/GNS_E.pdf"><u>2022 investor presentation</u></a>.</p><p>Even outside of investor calls, it’s unusual for consumer-facing companies to make concrete claims about customer satisfaction. One example of the few examples we found was the appliance company Dyson, which thought an 84% customer satisfaction rating for one of its vacuum cleaners was impressive enough to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/search/news/?keyword=customer%20satisfaction&amp;page=1&amp;pagesize=100"><u>merit a press release</u></a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Apple, by contrast, has claimed 98%-or-above approval in every investor call for the last half decade.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4550156-apple-inc-aapl-q4-2022-earnings-call-transcript"><u>Q4, 2022</u></a>&nbsp;- “And the latest survey of US consumers from 451 Research indicates iPhone customer satisfaction of 98%” - Luca Maestri</p></li><li><p><a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4463261-apple-inc-aapl-ceo-tim-cook-on-q4-2021-results-earnings-call-transcript"><u>Q4, 2021</u></a>&nbsp;- “The latest survey of U.S. consumers from 451 Research indicates iPhone customer satisfaction of 98% for iPhone, and our active installed base of iPhones reached a new all-time high.” - Luca Maestri</p></li><li><p><a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4382943-apple-inc-aapl-ceo-tim-cook-on-q4-2020-results-earnings-call-transcript"><u>Q4, 2020</u></a>&nbsp;- “In fact, in the U.S., the last survey of consumers from 451 Research indicates iPhone customer satisfaction of 98% for iPhone 11, 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max combined.” - Luca Maestri</p></li><li><p><a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4300690-apple-inc-aapl-ceo-tim-cook-on-q4-2019-results-earnings-call-transcript"><u>Q4, 2019</u></a>&nbsp;- “And in the U.S., the latest survey of consumers from 451 Research indicates iPhone customer satisfaction of 99% for iPhone XR, XS and XS Max combined.” - Luca Maestri</p></li><li><p><a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4217359-apple-aapl-q4-2018-results-earnings-call-transcript"><u>Q4, 2018</u></a>&nbsp;- “The latest survey of U.S. consumers from 451 Research indicates customer satisfaction of 98% for iPhone X, 8, and 8 Plus combined.” - Luca Maestri</p></li></ul><p>You can see the full list of Apple’s earnings call satisfaction claims in the appendix. The trend goes back to at least 2011.Other research firms were hired to produce the satisfaction claims prior to 2016, finding similar results.</p><p>It’s worth noting that Apple cites third-party research firms they have hired in every single quantitative mention of customer satisfaction they make on earnings calls going back to at least 2013. Why do this? Apple is the largest company in the world and almost certainly has extremely precise in-house measures of customer satisfaction. The answer likely has to do with credibility and deniability. An extraordinary claim sounds more credible if it’s coming from an independent party, even if you pay to produce it. Furthermore, if investors or others start asking questions about something as eyebrow raising as near-universal satisfaction, it’s easier to deflect than if Apple had produced the statistic in house.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="heading--we-contacted-apple-and-451-research-to-try-and-figure-out-what-was-going-on-with-the-satisfaction-numbers-they-didnt-respond">We contacted Apple and 451 Research to try and figure out what was going on with the satisfaction numbers.

By not mentioning that the survey participants are highly non-representative, Apple’s claims about the survey’s results are misleading, and out of step with basic best practices when reporting survey results. Apple gives the impression that this survey is representative of the population by not indicating otherwise.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="heading--our-take">Our Take&nbsp;</h2><p>The iPhone is an extraordinary phone. We recommend it to consumers using PerfectRec every day. But we’re 99% confident something doesn’t quite add up about Apple’s customer satisfaction claims.*&nbsp;</p><p><b>Consider:&nbsp;</b></p><ul><li><p>Independent sources report iPhone satisfaction levels that are significantly lower than what Apple claims.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>The iPhone 14 did not get a great critical reception when it launched late last year, and earlier research by PerfectRec found user reviews for the model were&nbsp;<a href="https://www.perfectrec.com/posts/the-iphone-14-is-apples-biggest-disappointment"><u>significantly worse</u></a>&nbsp;than previous editions of the handset.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Other companies with beloved consumer products tout much lower satisfaction rates when they talk about satisfaction at all.</p></li><li><p>It would be extraordinarily hard to find near-universal satisfaction using normal survey research methods and a representative sample.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>It is likely that Apple continues to work with 451 Research not despite its unusual results but because of them. Apple wants to make extraordinary customer satisfaction claims and has found an outside research firm to produce them. 451 Research polls an unrepresentative panel of tech professionals, early adopters and gadget enthusiasts about their iPhone satisfaction, which Apple presents as reflecting the opinions of iPhone users as a whole. It doesn’t. The iPhone is perhaps the most successful consumer product in the world. Its market long ago grew beyond early adopters and gadget enthusiasts.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s worth noting that Apple almost certainly has highly accurate internal measures of customer satisfaction. But instead of sharing those, the company instead highlights and likely misrepresent the findings of a third-party research firm they hired.&nbsp;</p><p>“We’re not calling on the SEC to investigate these customer satisfaction claims, since they have more important cases to go after,” Golden said.&nbsp; “But extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, and we believe Apple should review the survey results they trumpet on every earnings call. If they truly think they are valid, they should publish their methodology, and if not, they should issue retractions.”&nbsp;</p><p>*<i>In this case, it’s a figure of speech.&nbsp;</i></p><h2 id="heading--about">About:</h2><h3 id="heading--joe-golden">Joe Golden&nbsp;</h3><p>Dr. Joe Golden is founder and CEO of PerfectRec.

<p>The FCC reached out to me and is asking all of you who signed the petition to also file a comment in their docketing system for the ATSC 3 petition. This is very easy to do and will just take a few minutes. So far there are only about a dozen or so complaints filed. We can do better!! </p>

<p>2. On the first line for proceedings type in 16-142 . The system will then display the text “Authorizing Permissive Use of the “Next Generation” Broadcasting Television Standard.” Click on that to lock in the docket number. Here’s what it looks like:</p>

<p><br>3. Fill in your information. A US address is required and note that this will be part of the public record.</p>
<div><p>4. Write your comment in the comment section. It’s important to provide some detail especially how this change will make it difficult for YOU to consume over the air television.</p><p>Below is what I submitted, you are free to <strong><em>re-purpose</em></strong> this for your own submission but DO NOT COPY AND PASTE. The commission values feedback on how this transition will impact consumers and each unique story helps build the case better than a form letter. </p></div>
<blockquote>
<p>I am writing in opposition to DRM Encryption being part of the ATSC 3.0 standard. Over the last several weeks broadcasters have aggressively rolled out encryption on their ATSC 3 signals throughout the United States. At the moment this restricts most currently available tuners from being able to tune ATSC 3 content.</p>
<p>The standard’s voluntary rollout began with much promise. Prior to ATSC 3 being enabled here in Connecticut I could not reliably receive ATSC 1.0 content. When ATSC 3 spun up last year I could finally receive reliable over the air signals at my home. That was until WFSB-TV encrypted their broadcast and I’m now blocked from watching that station.</p>
<p>Encrypting over the air signals goes against the spirit of serving the public’s interest. Encryption adds an additional and unnecessary point of failure for receiving important information during emergency situations.</p>
<p>There are anti-trust implications too. Encryption restricts the consumer’s right to watch content from the public airwaves using tuners and personal recording equipment of their choice. With ATSC 1.0 consumers have many choices for watching and recording over the air television. With ATSC 3 only equipment blessed by the broadcasters through an arduous, opaque and expensive process will be allowed to tune content. One broadcaster, E.W. Scripps, purchased a manufacturer of tuning and recording equipment giving Scripps an advantage in the marketplace over competing products.</p>
<p>The broadcasters have said encryption is important for copy protection or other nonsense about protection from hackers and “deep fakes.” But the reality is they are trying to protect broadcast retransmission fees that now make up a significant portion of their revenue.</p>
<p>Lawyers for the broadcasters have effectively stopped every large scale retransmission effort making encryption unnecessary to protect their broadcast exclusivity rights. What this is really about is making it more difficult for everyday consumers to watch free over the air TV in an effort to push us back onto paid subscription services.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s really important if you care about this issue to make a submission. It doesn’t have to be long – just long enough for you to convey the impact that DRM encryption will have in accessing broadcasts on the public airwaves. </p>
<p>I still plan to drop this petition off with the FCC and congressional stakeholders in person with the Antenna Man. But the more of us who tell the FCC directly the better!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://fingerprint.com/blog/apple-macos-mdns-brute-force/">https://fingerprint.com/blog/apple-macos-mdns-brute-force/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36712788">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><em>This article is the second in a series that explores potential privacy vulnerabilities in Apple devices. In the <a href="https://fingerprint.com/blog/apple-id-region-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">first article</a>, we discussed detecting a system Apple ID region. This article presents a technique for revealing a user's first name without permissions using the mDNS protocol.</em></p><p>

<strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong> <a href="https://fingerprint.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fingerprint</a> as a company does not use this technique in our products, and we do not provide cross-site tracking services. We focus on detecting and preventing fraud and supporting modern privacy trends for removing third-party tracking entirely. There should be open discussions about such techniques to help internet browser providers fix them quickly.</p></div>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>In this article, we explain how the real name of a macOS user can be leaked through a browser without permissions. The proof of concept <a href="https://mdns-name-guesser.vercel.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">demo</a> is optimized for performance rather than accuracy and results may be affected by device or network configuration.</p>
<p>The name brute-forcing technique uses a pre-made list of the 50 most popular gender-specific names from a specific country origin. Our experiments showed that this is enough to detect a macOS user’s name correctly in 65% of the cases on average.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="multicast-dns-protocol-and-apple-bonjour">Multicast DNS protocol and Apple Bonjour&nbsp;</h2>
<p>The exploit implementation relies on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast_DNS" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">multicast DNS</a> (mDNS) protocol. In simple terms, the mDNS protocol is designed to register, discover, or broadcast device names over a local network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For instance, when a specific device, such as a printer, wants to be discovered on a local network, it sends a registration UDP packet to the reserved internal IP address <code>224.0.0.251</code>, which contains a hostname like <code>HP_LaserJet_Printer.local</code>. The <code>.local</code> domain TLD indicates that the hostname should be resolved using the mDNS protocol.</p>
<p>Such packets are automatically broadcast by a router to other devices in a local network, so they can cache the hostname. Alternatively, devices can send query packets to the same reserved IP address and try to discover a specifically named device, which may not exist in the network.</p>
<p>Some examples of mDNS hostnames are:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>johns-mac-mini.local</code></li>
<li><code>david-ZenBook-UX431DA-UM431DA.local</code></li>
<li><code>james-iphone.local</code>&nbsp;</li>
<li><code>canon-mf644c.local</code></li>
<li><code>bedroom-appletv.local</code></li>
<li><code>dlinkrouter.local</code></li>
</ol>
<p>The multicast DNS protocol is widely used on Apple devices as part of the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/bonjour/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple Bonjour</a> feature.</p>
<p>By default, Apple devices expose the first name of a user in their local hostnames, which we are going to use for the name brute-forcing technique. You can view or change your macOS local hostname in the <strong>Sharing</strong> section of <strong>System Settings.</strong></p>

<h2 id="resolving-mdns-hostnames-from-a-browser">Resolving mDNS hostnames from a browser</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, the multicast DNS protocol is based on UDP packets. Browser JavaScript environments do not support arbitrary UDP sockets, so it is not possible to use the mDNS protocol directly in a browser.</p>
<p>However, we can resolve hostnames from browsers by using a timing workaround. Let’s make two regular <code>fetch</code> GET requests to existing <code>device-1.local</code> and non-existing <code>device-2.local</code> mDNS addresses:</p>

<p>The browser will try to resolve the hostname provided in a URL address. If the address is resolved, it will send a TCP packet to the 80 port, which in our case will most likely be closed. On the screenshot above you can see two different error messages:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED</code> for the existing <code>device-1.local</code></li>
<li><code>ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED</code> for non-existing <code>device-2.local</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Both errors will be mapped into the same <code>Failed to fetch</code> JavaScript error, so we can’t rely on the error type, but we can perform a timing attack. Local networks are fast, so the valid mDNS hostname registered in the network will be resolved in a reasonable time frame, which is significantly faster than the default connection timeout. In the example above, the difference is four milliseconds for a valid address versus five seconds for an invalid one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This approach is consistent enough for the proof of concept solution and works similarly in all major browsers. In practice, you can use any network JavaScript API, such as <code>iframe</code>, <code>Image</code> or <code>WebRTC</code>, to perform timing attacks for DNS resolving.</p>
<h2 id="macos-user-name-brute-forcing">MacOS user name brute-forcing</h2>
<p>As illustrated earlier, the default macOS local hostname contains the user's first name and device name. Moreover, the hostname depends on a system language locale:</p>
<ul>
<li>English: <code>&lt;name&gt;s-macbook-pro.local</code></li>
<li>French: <code>macbook-air-de-&lt;name&gt;.local</code></li>
<li>Russian: <code>mac-mini-&lt;name&gt;.local</code></li>
</ul>
<p>For example, we can take the top 1,000 names, the top 10 locales, and five common macOS device names. In this scenario, it would be necessary to test 50,000 distinct hostnames, which might take over an hour. A more efficient strategy would be to limit the search scope to a single locale, a single device, and the 50 most common names within that specific locale. While this affects accuracy, it makes the attack more feasible in practical terms and significantly faster in general.</p>
<p>The locale selection can be based on a browser time zone, language, or IP address location. Safari browser, for example, reveals the system locale with the <code>navigator.language</code> property, which is typically consistent with the targeted hostname locale. Also, there are other workarounds to discover the user's country of origin, such as the <a href="https://fingerprint.com/blog/apple-id-region-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple ID region detection</a> method discussed previously.</p>
<p>The device options can be narrowed down by using the screen resolution. For instance, the <code>1728x1117</code> resolution is most likely a 16-inch Macbook Pro. An extended screen can be detected by using the <code>screen.isExtended</code> property, which will fallback the device options to three to five of the most commonly used Apple macOS devices.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://mdns-name-guesser.vercel.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">proof of concept demo</a> has a name country origin and name gender selectors, which results in 50-100 potential hostnames that can be enumerated within seconds. Among the 100 FingerprintJS employees who participated in an internal test, the demo successfully predicted the name in 65% of instances. <a href="https://github.com/fingerprintjs/blog-macos-mdns-brute-force" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The source code is available on GitHub.</a></p>

<p>It's important to mention that the proof of concept demo is simply a demonstration of the attack and may not be successful in some cases. Some of the factors that could impact the results are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The presence of rare or unique names or non-standard macOS hostnames</li>
<li>Particular network configurations or VPN networks</li>
<li>Enabled firewall in macOS network settings</li>
</ul>
<p>If the demo does not work for you, consider using the advanced configuration settings to verify the list of the probed names and the device name pattern applied. If you use a VPN, consider testing it with and without VPN, because the result may change.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Considering the inherent weaknesses and numerous limitations, this attack isn't practical. It can be effortlessly detected in the network tab of browser developer tools unless there is deliberate intent from a website owner to de-anonymize its visitors.</p>
<p>This series of articles merely explores the boundaries of internet privacy and relies on unconventional privacy breaching techniques. As another example, by combining this method with <a href="https://fingerprint.com/blog/external-protocol-flooding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">detection of installed applications</a>, there’s a potential to develop a harmful website capable of displaying your real name and job title, based on the list of professional applications used, all without requiring any permissions.</p>
<p>Even though this article mentions Apple devices running macOS, the mDNS discovery technique can be utilized in variety of ways. For instance, it could be used to perform a local network scan to detect devices such as printers, smart TVs, smart speakers, and other home IoT devices.</p>
<p>This method is also applicable to iPhones and iPads, given that <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/wi-fi-syncing-mchlada1d602/mac" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sync over Wi-Fi</a> or Safari remote debug features are activated.</p></div></div>]]></description>

        <h2 id="how-hype-will-turn-your-security-key-into-junk">How Hype Will Turn Your Security Key Into Junk</h2>
<p>In the last few months there has been a lot of hype about "passkeys"
and how they are going to change authentication forever. But that hype
will come at a cost.</p>
<p>Obsession with passkeys are about to turn your security keys (yubikeys,
feitian, nitrokeys, ...) into obsolete and useless junk.</p>
<p>It all comes down to one thing - resident keys.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-resident-key">What is a Resident Key</h2>
<p>To understand the problem, we need to understand what a
discoverable/resident key is.</p>
<p>You have probably seen that most keys support an 'unlimited' number of
accounts. This is achieved by sending a "key wrapped key" to the
security key. When the Relying Party (Authentication Server) wants to
authenticate your security key, it will provide you a "credential id".
That credential ID is an encrypted blob that only your security key can
decrypt. If your security key can decrypt that blob it yields a private
key that is specific to that single RP that you can use for signatures.</p>

<p>This is what is called a non-resident or non-discoverable credential.
The reason is that the private key must be <em>discovered</em> by the security
key having the Credential ID provided to it externally. This is because
the private keys are <em>not resident</em> inside the security enclave - only
the master key is.</p>
<p>Contrast to this, a resident key or discoverable credential is one where
the private key is <em>stored</em> in the security key itself. This allows the
security key to discover (hence the name) what private keys might be
used in the authentication.</p>

<p>Now, the primary difference here is that resident/discoverable keys
consume <em>space</em> on the security key to store them since they need to
persist - there is no credential id to rely on to decrypt with our
master key!</p>
<h3 id="are-non-resident-keys-less-secure">Are non-resident keys less secure?</h3>
<p>A frequent question here is if non resident keys are less secure than
resident ones. Credential ID's as key wrapped keys are secure since
they are encrypted with aes128 and hmaced. This prevents them being
tampered with or decrypted by an external source. If aes128 were broken
and someone could decrypt your private-key in abscence of your security
key, they probably could also break TLS encyrption, attack ssh and do
much worse. Your key wrapped keys rely on the same security features
that TLS relies on.</p>
<h2 id="resident-keys-and-your-security-key">Resident Keys and Your Security Key</h2>
<p>Now that we know what a resident key is, we can look at how these work
with your security keys.</p>
<p>Since resident keys store their key in the device, this needs to consume
<em>space</em> inside the security key. Generally, resident key slots are at a
premium on a security key. Nitrokeys for example only support 8 resident
keys. Yubikeys generally support between 20 and 32. Some keys support
<em>no</em> resident keys at all.</p>
<p>The other problem is what CTAP standard your key implements. There are
three versions - CTAP2.0, CTAP2.1PRE and CTAP2.1.</p>
<p>In CTAP2.1 (the latest) you can individually manage, update and delete
specific resident keys from your device.</p>
<p>In CTAP2.0 and CTAP2.1PRE however, you can not. You can not delete a
residentkey without <em>resetting the whole device</em>. Resetting the device
also resets your master key, meaning all your non-resident keys will no
longer work either. This makes resident keys on a CTAP2.0 and CTAP2.1PRE
device a serious commitment. You really don't want to accidentally fill
up that limited space you have!</p>
<p>In most cases, your key is <em>very likely</em> to be CTAP2.0 or CTAP2.1PRE.</p>
<h2 id="so-why-are-resident-keys-a-problem">So Why Are Resident Keys a Problem?</h2>
<p>On their own, and used carefully resident keys are great for certain
applications. The problem is the hype and obsession with <em>passkeys</em>.</p>
<p>In 2022 Apple annouced their passkeys feature on MacOS/iOS allowing the
use of touchid/faceid as a webauthn authenticator similar to your
security key. Probably quite wisely, rather than calling them
"touchid" or "credentials" or "authenticators" Apple chose to have
a nicer name for users. Honestly passkeys is a good name rather than
"webauthn authenticator" or "security key". It evokes a similar
concept to passwords which people are highly accustomed to, while also
being different enough with the 'key' to indicate that it operates in
a different way.</p>
<p>The problem (from an external view) is that passkeys was a branding or
naming term of something - but overnight authentication thought leaders
needed to be <em>on the hype</em>. "What is a passkey?". Since Apple didn't
actually define it, this left a void for our thought leaders to answer
that question for users hungry to know "what indeed is a passkey?".</p>
<p>As a creator of a relying party and the webauthn library for Rust, we
defined passkeys as the name for "all possible authenticators" that a
person may choose to use. We wanted to support the goal to remove and
eliminate passwords, and passkeys are a nice name for this.</p>
<p>Soon after that, some community members took to referring to passkeys to
mean "credentials that are synchronised between multiple devices".
This definition is at the least, not harmful, even if it doesn't
express that there are many possible types of authenticators that can be
used.</p>
<p>Some months later a person took the stage at FIDO's Authenticate
conference and annouced "a passkey is a resident key". Because of the
scale and size of the platform, this definition has now stuck. This
definition has become so invasive that even <em>FIDO</em> now use it as <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/#faq">their
definition</a>.</p>
<p>Part of the reason this definition is hyped is because it works with an
upcoming browser feature that allows autocomplete of a username and
webauthn credential if the key is resident. You don't have to type your
username. This now means that we have webauthn libraries pushing for
residentkey as a requirement for all registrations, and many people will
follow this advice without seeing the problem.</p>
<p>The problem is that security keys with their finite storage and lack of
credential management will fill up <em>rapidly</em>. In my password manager I
have more than 150 stored passwords. If all of these were to become
resident keys I would need to buy at lesat 5 yubikeys to store all the
accounts, and then another 5-10 as "backups". I really don't want to
have to juggle and maintain 10 to 15 yubikeys ...</p>
<p>This is an awful user experience to put it mildly. People who choose to
use security keys, now won't be able to due to passkeys resident key
requirements. What will also confuse users is this comes on the tail of
FIDO certified keys marketing with statements (which are true with
non-resident keys) like:</p>
<p><em>Infinite key pair storage</em></p>
<p><em>There is no limit to the number of accounts registered in [redacted]
FIDO® Security Key.</em></p>
<p>To add further insult, an expressed goal of the Webauthn Work Group is
that users should always be free to choose any authenticator they wish
without penalty. Passkeys forcing key residency flies directly in the
face of this.</p>
<p>This leaves few authenticator types which will work properly in this
passkey world. Apples own passkeys, Android passkeys, password managers
that support webauthn, Windows with TPM 2.0, and Chromium based browsers
on MacOS (because of how they use the touchid as a TPM).</p>
<h2 id="what-can-be-done">What Can Be Done?</h2>
<h3 id="submit-to-the-webauth-wg-browsers-to-change-rk-preferred-to-exclude-security-keys">Submit to the Webauth WG / Browsers to change rk=preferred to exclude security keys</h3>
<p>Rather than passkeys being resident keys, passkeys could be expanded to
be all possible authenticators where some subset opportunistically are
resident. This puts passwordless front and center with residency as a
bonus ui/ux for those who opt to use devices that support unlimited
resident keys.</p>
<p>Currently there are three levels of request an RP can make to request
resident keys. Discouraged, Preferred and Required. Here is what happens
with different authenticator types when you submit each level.</p>

</span></code></pre>
<p>Notice that in rk=preferred the three columns behave the same as
rk=required?</p>
<p>Rather than passkeys setting rk=required, if rk=preferred were softened
so that on preferred meant "create a resident key only if storage is
unlimited" then we would have a situation where Android/iOS would
always get resident keys, and security keys would not have space
consumed.</p>
<p>However, so far the WG is resistant to this change. It is not out of the
question that browsers could implement this change externally, but that
would in reality be down to the chrome team to decide.</p>
<h3 id="insist-on-your-passkey-library-setting-rk-discouraged">Insist on your Passkey library setting rk=discouraged</h3>
<p>Rather than rk=required which excludes security keys, rk=discouraged is
the next best thing. Yes it means that android users won't get
conditional UI. But what do we prefer - some people have to type a
username (that already has provisions to autocomplete anyway). Or do we
damage and exclude security keys completely?</p>
<h3 id="contact-fido-and-request-rk-storage-as-a-certification-feature">Contact FIDO and request RK storage as a certification feature</h3>
<p>Currently FIDO doesn't mandate any amount of storage requirements for
certified devices. Given that FIDO also seem to want resident keys, then
they should also mandate that certified devices have the ability to
store thousands of resident keys. This way as a consumer you can pick
and select certified devices.</p>
<h3 id="something-else">Something Else?</h3>
<p>If you have other ideas on how to improve this let me know!</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The hype around passkeys being resident keys will prevent - or severly
hinder - users of security keys from choosing the authenticator they
want to use online in the future.</p>

If you aren’t familiar with them: Factorio is an open-world RTS where you build and optimize supply chains in order to launch a satellite and restore communications with your home planet, and Kafka is a distributed streaming platform, which handles asynchronous communication in a durable way.</p><p id="7dd5">I wonder how far we can take the analogy between Factorio and Kafka before it starts to break down. Let’s start from scratch, explore the core Kafka concepts through Factorio visualizations, and have some fun along the way.</p><figure><figcaption>If you don’t have a lot of time to spare, don’t download Factorio.</figcaption></figure><h2 id="e1ae">Why bother with async messaging?</h2><p id="8292">Let’s say we have three microservices. One for mining iron ore, one for smelting iron ore into iron plates, and one for producing iron gear wheels from these plates. We can chain these services with synchronous HTTP calls. Whenever our mining drill has new iron ore, it does a POST call on the smelting furnace, which in turn POSTs to the factory.</p><figure><figcaption>From left to right: mining, smelting and producing — tightly coupled via synchronous communication</figcaption></figure><p id="c2d1">This setup served us well, until there was a power outage in the factory. The furnace’s HTTP calls failed, causing the mining drill’s calls to fail as well. We can implement <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CircuitBreaker.html" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">circuit breakers</a> and retries to prevent cascading failures and message loss, but at some point we’ll have to stop trying, or we’ll run out of memory.</p><figure><figcaption>Power outage at the factory</figcaption></figure><p id="b3c9">If only there was a way to decouple these microservices... This is, of course, where Kafka comes in. With Kafka, you can store streams of records in a fault-tolerant and durable way. In Kafka terminology, these streams are called <em>topics</em>.</p><figure><figcaption>Microservices decoupled by asynchronous messaging</figcaption></figure><p id="1cf3">With asynchronous topics between services, messages, or <em>records</em>, are buffered during peak loads, and when there is an outage. These buffers obviously have limited capacity, so let’s talk about scalability.</p><p id="4521">We can increase storage capacity and throughput by adding Kafka servers to the cluster. Another way is to increase disk size (for storage), or CPU and network speed (for throughput). Which of these options give you the best value for money is use-case specific, but buying <em>bigger </em>servers — unlike buying <em>more</em> servers — is subject to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diminishing_returns" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">the law of diminishing returns</a>.

These substreams are called <em>partitions.</em> Whenever a service <em>produces</em> a new record, this service gets to decide which partition the record should land on.</p><figure><figcaption>A wagon producing records, a partitioner that puts messages on the right partition, and a topic with four partitions.</figcaption></figure><p id="07ee">The <a href="https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/trunk/clients/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/clients/producer/internals/DefaultPartitioner.java#L69" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">default <em>partitioner</em></a><em> </em>hashes the message key and modulos that over the number of partitions:</p><figure></figure><p id="44f4">That way messages with the same key always end up on the same partition.</p><p id="8c62">Note that messages are only guaranteed to be ordered within the context of a producer and partition.

When you start listening to a topic, by default the records from all partitions are routed to you. It’s common though, to have multiple instances of a microservice running at the same time to achieve higher throughput or availability. If they all start listening to the topic, each record gets processed by each instance, which is usually not what you want.</p><figure><figcaption>All microservice instances consume all messages</figcaption></figure><p id="cd25"><em>Consumer groups </em>allow you to evenly divide the partitions among multiple consumers. When a microservice instance joins the consumer group, Kafka will reassign some of the partitions to it. Likewise, when an instance crashes, or leaves the group for another reason, its partitions will be assigned to other instances. Kafka makes sure the partitions are always evenly divided among the consumers in each group.</p><figure><figcaption>A single consumer group with three consumers</figcaption></figure><p id="0525">If there’s a topic where the number of records per partition are skewed, you might be in trouble. An instance might not be able to keep up, because it was assigned the partition with many records, while other instances are idle. It’s up to you to make sure that there are no partitions that have vastly more records than others.</p><figure><figcaption>Messages are piling up on a hot partition</figcaption></figure><p id="6201">Each consumer keeps track of which records it has processed. Since records are processed in order, a simple <em>offset </em>is enough. Every once in a while (5 seconds by default), a consumer will <em>commit</em> its offset to Kafka<em>.</em></p><p id="f018">When a consumer leaves its group, its partitions are given to other consumer in the group. The new consumers will be able to start requesting records starting at the offset where the previous consumer stopped.</p><p id="e71a">It is possible that a record was processed, but not yet committed. You’ll either have to start at the committed offset, or start processing new messages and skip everything that’s not yet processed. This is why Kafka can only guarantee that messages are delivered at least once, or at most once.</p></div><div><p id="e033">The analogy no longer really makes sense when we start duplicating data. With Kafka, we can process a single record multiple times. Multiple consumer groups can consume the same records. Topics can be stored with a <em>replication factor </em>of three for reliability. Topics can have a <em>retention period</em> after which records are deleted. All this is possible because data, unlike iron, can be duplicated easily.</p><p id="5d27">This is a good place to end this post. We’ve covered all the major concepts of Kafka and you should have a general understanding of how Kafka works. Let’s wrap up with a short recap.</p><h2 id="d898">What we learned</h2><p id="f248">Kafka is a distributed streaming platform that stores records in a durable way through replicating records across multiple servers. Topics consist of partitions, that store records in order. Partitioners decide which records belong on which partitions. Consumer groups are optional, and help distribute partitions among consumers for scalability. Offsets are committed as checkpoints for when consumers crash.</p><p id="89e2">And that, in a nutshell, is how Kafka works.</p><p id="b734"><em>edit: Like how I teach?

  <p>Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Opill (norgestrel) tablet for nonprescription use to prevent pregnancy— the first daily oral contraceptive approved for use in the U.S. without a prescription. Approval of this progestin-only oral contraceptive pill provides an option for consumers to purchase oral contraceptive medicine without a prescription at drug stores, convenience stores and grocery stores, as well as online. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The timeline for availability and price of this nonprescription product is determined by the manufacturer. Other approved formulations and dosages of other oral contraceptives will remain available by prescription only.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>“Today’s approval marks the first time a nonprescription daily oral contraceptive will be an available option for millions of people in the United States,” said Patrizia Cavazzoni, M.D., director of the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “When used as directed, daily oral contraception is safe and is expected to be more effective than currently available nonprescription contraceptive methods in preventing unintended pregnancy.”</strong></p>

<p>Nonprescription availability of Opill may reduce barriers to access by allowing individuals to obtain an oral contraceptive without the need to first see a health care provider. Almost half of the 6.1 million pregnancies in the U.S. each year are unintended. Unintended pregnancies have been linked to negative maternal and perinatal outcomes, including reduced likelihood of receiving early prenatal care and increased risk of preterm delivery, with associated adverse neonatal, developmental and child health outcomes. Availability of nonprescription Opill may help reduce the number of unintended pregnancies and their potential negative impacts.</p>

<p>The contraceptive efficacy of norgestrel was established with the original approval for prescription use in 1973. HRA Pharma <a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-application-process-nonprescription-drugs/prescription-nonprescription-rx-otc-switches">applied</a> to switch norgestrel from a prescription to an over-the-counter product. For approval of a product for use in the nonprescription setting, the FDA requires that the <a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/nda/2023/017031Orig1s041SumR.pdf">applicant demonstrate</a> that the product can be used by consumers safely and effectively, relying only on the nonprescription drug labeling without any assistance from a health care professional. Studies showed that consumer understanding of information on the Opill Drug Facts label was high overall and that a high proportion of consumers understood the label instructions, supporting their ability to properly use the drug when it is available as an over-the-counter product. When properly used, Opill is safe and effective.</p>

<p>Opill should be taken at the same time every day; adherence to daily use at the same time of day is important for the effectiveness of Opill. Using medications that interact with Opill can result in decreased efficacy of Opill or the other medication, or both, potentially resulting in unintended pregnancy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The most common side effects of Opill include irregular bleeding, headaches, dizziness, nausea, increased appetite, abdominal pain, cramps or bloating.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Opill should not be used by those who have or have ever had breast cancer. Consumers who have any other form of cancer should ask a doctor before use. Opill also should not be used together with another hormonal birth control product such as another oral contraceptive tablet, a vaginal ring, a contraceptive patch, a contraceptive implant, a contraceptive injection or an IUD (intra-uterine device).</p>

<p>Use of Opill may be associated with changes in vaginal bleeding patterns, such as irregular spotting and prolonged bleeding. Consumers should inform a health care provider if they develop repeated vaginal bleeding after sex, or prolonged episodes of bleeding or amenorrhea (absence of menstrual period). Individuals who miss two periods (or have missed a single period and have missed doses of Opill) or suspect they may be pregnant should take a pregnancy test. Consumers should discontinue Opill if pregnancy is confirmed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Opill is not for use as emergency contraception and does not prevent pregnancy after unprotected sex. Oral contraceptives do not protect against transmission of HIV, AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases such as chlamydia, genital herpes, genital warts, gonorrhea, hepatitis B and syphilis. Condoms should be used to prevent sexually transmitted diseases.</p>

<p>The FDA granted the approval to Laboratoire HRA Pharma, recently acquired by Perrigo Company plc.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2023/07/13/Rust-1.71.0.html">https://blog.rust-lang.org/2023/07/13/Rust-1.71.0.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36709361">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>The Rust team is happy to announce a new version of Rust, 1.71.0. Rust is a programming language empowering everyone to build reliable and efficient software.</p>
<p>If you have a previous version of Rust installed via rustup, you can get 1.71.0 with:</p>
<pre><code>rustup update stable
</code></pre>
<p>If you don't have it already, you can <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/install.html">get <code>rustup</code></a> from the appropriate page on our website, and check out the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/releases/tag/1.71.0">detailed release notes for 1.71.0</a> on GitHub.</p>
<p>If you'd like to help us out by testing future releases, you might consider updating locally to use the beta channel (<code>rustup default beta</code>) or the nightly channel (<code>rustup default nightly</code>). Please <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/new/choose">report</a> any bugs you might come across!</p>
<h2>What's in 1.71.0 stable</h2>
<h3>C-unwind ABI</h3>
<p>1.71.0 stabilizes <code>C-unwind</code> (and other <code>-unwind</code> suffixed ABI variants<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>).</p>
<p>The behavior for unforced unwinding (the typical case) is specified in <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/2945-c-unwind-abi.md#abi-boundaries-and-unforced-unwinding">this
table from the RFC which proposed this feature</a>. To summarize:</p>
<p>Each ABI is mostly equivalent to the same ABI without <code>-unwind</code>, except that
with <code>-unwind</code> the behavior is defined to be safe when an unwinding operation
(<code>panic</code> or C++ style exception) crosses the ABI boundary. For <code>panic=unwind</code>,
this is a valid way to let exceptions from one language unwind the stack in
another language without terminating the process (as long as the exception is
caught in the same language from which it originated); for <code>panic=abort</code>, this
will typically abort the process immediately.</p>
<p>For this initial stabilization, <em>no change</em> is made to the existing ABIs (e.g.
<code>"C"</code>), and unwinding across them remains undefined behavior. A future Rust
release will amend these ABIs to match the behavior specified in the RFC as the
final part in stabilizing this feature (usually aborting at the boundary).
Users are encouraged to start using the new unwind ABI variants in their code
to remain future proof if they need to unwind across the ABI boundary.</p>
<h3>Debugger visualization attributes</h3>
<p>1.71.0 stabilizes support for a new attribute, <code>#[debug_visualizer(natvis_file = "...")]</code> and <code>#[debug_visualizer(gdb_script_file = "...")]</code>, which allows
embedding Natviz descriptions and GDB scripts into Rust libraries to
improve debugger output when inspecting data structures created by those
libraries. Rust itself has packaged similar scripts for some time for the
standard library, but this feature makes it possible for library authors to
provide a similar experience to end users.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/reference/attributes/debugger.html#the-debugger_visualizer-attribute">reference</a>
for details on usage.</p>
<h3>raw-dylib linking</h3>
<p>On Windows platforms, Rust now supports using functions from dynamic libraries without requiring those libraries to be available at build time, using the new <code>kind="raw-dylib”</code> option for <code>#[link]</code>.</p>
<p>This avoids requiring users to install those libraries (particularly difficult for cross-compilation), and avoids having to ship stub versions of libraries in crates to link against. This simplifies crates providing bindings to Windows libraries.</p>
<p>Rust also supports binding to symbols provided by DLLs by ordinal rather than named symbol, using the new <code>#[link_ordinal]</code> attribute.</p>
<h3>Upgrade to musl 1.2</h3>
<p>As <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2023/05/09/Updating-musl-targets.html">previously announced</a>,
Rust 1.71 updates the musl version to 1.2.3. Most users should not be affected by this change.</p>
<h3>Const-initialized thread locals</h3>
<p>Rust 1.59.0 stabilized <code>const</code> initialized thread local support in the standard
library, which allows for more optimal code generation. However, until now this
feature was missed in release notes and
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/macro.thread_local.html">documentation</a>.
Note that this stabilization does not make <code>const { ... }</code> a valid expression
or syntax in other contexts; that is a separate and currently unstable
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/76001">feature</a>.</p>
<pre><code>use std::cell::Cell;

thread_local! {
    pub static FOO: Cell&lt;u32&gt; = const { Cell::new(1) };
}
</code></pre>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Abdusemi was distracted. He had just been dealing with a young Uyghur man who tried to take his own life, and with another teenager who ran off halfway through drug rehab. He was frayed but resigned. This was a typical day. The psychologist who volunteered to help him shoulder the burden of supporting these ethnic minority kids fleeing China gave up three months into his term under the strain. Now Abdusemi was alone again.</p>
<p>Abdusemi Hoten runs a hostel in an Istanbul suburb where many of the city’s 50,000 Uyghurs settle, housing boys and young men who have fallen into drug and alcohol abuse and are seeking refuge from sleeping on the streets or in derelict buildings. He made mistakes himself after losing touch with his own family in 2016, and he feels called to rescue others from what so easily might have been his own fate.</p></div><div>
<p>He knows what they go through. News of his own family’s treatment by Chinese authorities shook him hard. His mother was taken to a so-called reeducation camp and his father was sentenced to five years in prison. He has had no news from either parent since. Penniless, Hoten’s life unraveled quickly. He ended up taking drugs and living rough until an uncle found him and gently guided him back. Now, in his mid-thirties, he is newly wed and in the final stages of a Ph.D.</p>
<p>The hostel survives from hand to mouth. Its original funders, the East Turkestan New Generation Movement Association in Istanbul, and the U.S.-based Campaign for Uyghurs, left Hoten to manage it on his own. His peppercorn salary from random handouts barely covers the rent, but his commitment to the cause is unwavering.</p>
<p>“I have tried to hand the project over, but no one wants to take it on,” Hoten told The China Project. “They don’t feel like I do about these guys. If I don’t do this, who will help them?”</p>
<p>The donation in 2019 of a four-story apartment building by a well-wisher was just the start of Hoten’s efforts to assist the scores of young Uyghur males he found sleeping in the basements around Istanbul, high on the drugs Chinese traffickers scared them into peddling. In exchange for the dirty work, the young Uyghurs were promised that their families would be “looked after” back home in Xinjiang.</p>
<p>“If they refused, they were told their families would be harmed,” said Hoten, who frequently scours the neighborhood at night for kids sheltering on construction sites. “In their vulnerable state, they were prepared to believe anything.”</p>
<p>The problems the Uyghur youths face are complex. Some as young as 14 became de facto orphans when the money their parents sent for their Turkish education dried up and the emotional rug was pulled from under them.</p>
<p>“Not only were they left to fend for themselves, but they worried all the time about what was happening to their families,” Hoten said. “Stories of child abductions, rape, and long prison sentences filled their days and nights. They felt lost.”</p>
<p>For an exiled Uyghur in Istanbul, success is difficult to measure. Facing the many who don’t make it every day, Hoten often is tempted to lose heart. Today, however, he basked in one of his triumphs. He had just received an invitation to the wedding of a former hostel resident.</p>
<p>Mewlan had come to Hoten hooked on cocaine. It had been a long and slow path to recovery. After three weeks in the “cold turkey suite” at the top of their building, where residents sweat it out with pain killers as a last resort, Mewlan graduated to the third and then the second floor, each with more freedom. Every now and again, he relapsed and stole hostel equipment to get his next fix, but soon he would return contrite, ready to try again.</p>
<p>Hoten believed in Mewlan and always took him back. Finally, he was ready to be sent on a work placement, far from Istanbul and temptation, to a restaurant in Central Anatolia. He was billeted with a family in Kayseri, where a large community of Uyghurs flourishes. They helped to keep him on the straight and narrow. He met his Uyghur fiancé there, and the rest is history.</p>
<p>“This kind of success keeps me going and helps me feel like all those struggles were worth it,” Hoten said.</p>
<p>The hostel was almost at capacity with 36 residents going through a program of lectures, activities, English lessons, and work placement for those who were ready. Specialist medical and psychological help was called on regularly for pro-bono assistance.</p>
<p>“The need is overwhelming,” Hoten said. “We are a small outfit and need to expand, but I am one person and cannot do everything.”</p>
<p>Faced with his own limitations and a building whose crumbling masonry is an earthquake hazard, he fears for the future.</p>
<p>“These problems are urgent and not going to go away. As the years go by waiting for news from home, the trauma is also increasing. These guys need more help than I can give them alone,” Hoten said. “We need a reliable funding source and a new building or I cannot guarantee the future. We have many success stories like Mewlan. They are all worth helping.”</p>
<h3>Healing arts</h3>
<p>Samarjan Saidi, 34, runs a youth center in the heart of a conservative Uyghur suburb in Istanbul, not far from Hoten’s hostel. He, too, has seen Uyghur youth fall prey to cheap Chinese drugs and spiral down. He knows of two drug deaths and a couple of others who returned voluntarily to the Uyghur region, not able to face a future without their families, despite knowing that “reeducation,” or worse, awaited them. They have not been heard from since.</p>
<p>“Hopelessness is the big mental health issue here,” Saidi told The China Project. “Their future stretches unpredictably in front of them. Even if they have plans, there is no one by their side to help see them through.”</p>
<p>Saidi, born in the Uyghur region, was taken to Denmark at the age of 10 by his mother, who left Xinjiang to pursue a doctorate. His father and brother stayed behind and were marooned when Beijing began the clampdown on China’s Muslim minorities. Saidi became a Danish citizen and eventually trained as a civil engineer. Concern over the plight of those fleeing their homelands led him to abandon his career to work with refugees who landed in Denmark. For nine years, he ran a boxing gym catering to that growing community, but his hankering to return to his birthplace never left.</p>
<p>When a return to northwestern China became impossible, Saidi decided instead to travel to Turkey to help expose what China was doing to Uyghurs in Xinjiang. In Istanbul, he made himself available as a translator to international reporters interviewing the first wave of Uyghur refugees.</p>
<p>Saidi collated 2,500 witness accounts given by Uyghurs who escaped the roundups in China. Over three years, he processed an avalanche of interviews, translated countless testimonials, and coordinated recovery workshops.</p>
<p>“The trauma of listening to all this every day was just too much,” Saidi said. “I couldn’t take any more pain. I became stressed and depressed, and had to take a step back.”</p>
<p>He moved sideways, starting a kickboxing club for young Uyghurs. They met in a dark basement and, after expanding to tutoring English and math, his venue became a thriving hub. Funding became available to move aboveground and eventually they found a large, light, and airy floor of an office block, a beauty parlor abandoned during COVID. Three months later, painted and decorated, it was transformed into what initially was named the Palwan Youth Center. <em>Palwan</em> means “strong man” in Uyghur. Artistic young Uyghur boys and girls piled in to assist in fixing it up and, wanting a softer feel, renamed it the Bostan Youth Center. <em>Bostan</em> means “oasis.” The kickboxing club moved nearby and continues to be popular.</p>
<p>Saidi is full of ideas for courses and projects he’d like to pursue, but defers to the kids’ leadership. There are 300 young Uyghurs registered with the center and, daily, about 30 regulars turn up to drink tea, chat, play cards, and watch movies together, discussing them afterward. Some practice guitar or the long-necked two-stringed lute called the dutar. Others pick up woodworking and movie-making skills in a workshop. Still others learn to create in the art studio.</p>
<p>“We’re slow and deep. Not a quick fix,” said Saidi. “Our kids like to be secret, so there are no films or videos of them. They need to feel safe here.”</p>

<p>Their first group project was the “<a href="https://www.codastory.com/authoritarian-tech/uyghur-students-open-genocide-experience-exhibition-in-istanbul/">Uyghur Genocide Museum</a>,” a multimedia simulation of detention camp conditions suffered by their relatives and friends in Xinjiang. It opened in Istanbul to local and international visitors for a week in November 2021, filling a series of spaces in the arched corridors of the East Turkistan Foundation with satellite images of internment camps, photos, news features, and their own artistic renderings inspired by reading survivor accounts given to the <a href="https://uyghurtribunal.com/">Uyghur Tribunal</a> in London in 2021. A central feature of the exhibition was a cold steel “Tiger Chair,” to which prisoners are tied and forced to confess, and a table full of instruments of torture.</p>
<p>“They wanted to show visitors that this is real and it is happening to people today,” Saidi said. “They feel strongly that the world must know what is happening to their people.”</p>

</div>
<p>The Bostan Youth Center is manned by around 10 adult volunteers who come to hang out with the kids. Saidi is the only full-timer, paid sporadically whenever donations come in. They operate an informal mentoring scheme and look out for youngsters who are struggling.</p>
<p>“We try to understand each kid — who they are and where their interests lie,” Saidi said. “Some are very needy spiritually and emotionally. They have a lot of trauma and their situation is complicated.”</p>
<p>Young Uyghurs at the center often are matched with volunteers who have a psychology background.</p>
<p>“It takes a while for those who come to build trust in a community where suspicion is rife,” Saidi said. “Some want help with practicalities such as making a study plan, others just want to come here to sit and listen. They don’t even want to talk. That’s fine with us, everyone is different.”</p>

<p>Zuleyha, the center’s volunteer art tutor, is a fashion design student. She declined to share her surname. It’s her job to give a few basic techniques to the young people who come to her and let them find their own way. She loves being part of the community and the opportunity she has to bring out the best in members of the group.</p>
<p>Zuleyha said sometimes the kids just draw for the sake of it, and other times they work toward an exhibition.</p>
<p>“It is really exciting to see how they learn, increase in confidence, and develop their own style,” she said.</p>
<h3>Safe space</h3>
<p>Many Uyghurs at the center feel they have lost everything.</p>
<p>“They hang onto their Uyghurness and their language,” said Saidi, stressing the importance of the center itself as a Uyghur-speaking space, where Uyghur festivals, community, hospitality, customs around tea, food, and traditional games are celebrated.</p>
<p>At the center, Saidi would love to develop the idea of Meshrep, a Uyghur communal event now banned in the homeland as a threat to Beijing’s idea of national unity. Beijing abolished the Uyghur evening gatherings of music and humorous attempts to keep the wayward in line, dishing out mock punishments to make a point.</p>
<p>“The Chinese government pushes the idea that being Uyghur is just about singing and dancing,” Saidi said. “Those who were brought up in the Uyghur region never had a chance to experience other aspects of our ancient culture.”</p>
<p>In the 1980s, worried that Meshrep would address youth disenfranchisement, unemployment, and religion, the Chinese Communist Party clamped down hard. The only so-called Meshrep today are eviscerated versions of the original: song-and-dance programs on Chinese state TV, or Uyghur culture festivals put on for Han Chinese or foreign tourists.</p>
<p>Saidi hopes a version of Meshrep will emerge from youth center life to encourage unity, leadership, team building, and promote the fun aspects of Uyghur culture and music. Keeping their culture pure is a challenge.</p>
<p>“We are living in a new country whose culture has elements of our own. There are bound to be overlaps and varying degrees of assimilation,” Saidi said, acknowledging the inevitability of intermarriage, no matter how great the desire to marry among Uyghurs. “Somehow, we must learn to keep our own culture alive, but realize that we will need to move forward, and might not be able to keep everything.”</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://github.com/ory/kratos/releases/tag/v1.0.0">https://github.com/ory/kratos/releases/tag/v1.0.0</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36708907">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-pjax="true" data-test-selector="body-content" data-view-component="true"><p>We are thrilled to announce Ory Kratos v1.0, the powerful Identity, User Management, and Authentication system! With this major update, Ory Kratos brings a host of enhancements and fixes that greatly improve the user experience and overall performance.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/ory/kratos/assets/3372410/b84ed043-6e9b-4934-9f78-127345721bbf"><img src="https://github.com/ory/kratos/assets/3372410/b84ed043-6e9b-4934-9f78-127345721bbf" alt="ory-kratos-v1"></a></p>
<h2>Ory Kratos 1.0 is stable and robust</h2>
<p>Several compelling reasons led to label Ory Kratos as a major release and graduated project: Ory Identities on Ory Network, powered by Ory Kratos, has been serving production traffic for well over a year, flawlessly. Ory Kratos is successfully processing over 100 million API requests daily and has about 100 million Docker Pulls. We have maintained stability within the Ory Kratos APIs for nearly two years, demonstrating their robustness and reliability. No breaking changes mean that developers can trust the stability of Ory Kratos in production.</p>
<h2>Notable changes</h2>
<p>Ory Kratos 1.0 introduces a variety of new features while focusing on stability, robustness, and improved performance. Major enhancements include support for social login and single-sign-on via OpenID connect in native apps, emails sent through HTTP rather than SMTP, and full compatibility with Ory Hydra v2.2.0. Users will also find multi-region support in the Ory Network for broader geographic reach, improved export functionality for all credential types, and enhanced session management with the introduction of the "provider ID" parameter. Other additions comprise distroless images for leaner resource utilization and faster deployment and support for the Lark OIDC provider.</p>
<h2>New features and full multi-region support in Ory Network</h2>
<p>Significant improvements and fixes accompany these new features. Enhanced OIDC flows now include the ability to forward prompt upstream parameters, offering developers increased flexibility and customization options. The logout flow also supports the <code>return_to</code> parameter, facilitating more flexible redirection post-user logout. Performance has been a key focus, with Ory Kratos 1.0 now capable of handling hundreds of millions of active users monthly. Critical bug fixes have been applied to prevent users from being redirected to incorrect destinations, ensuring smoother authentication and authorization. Additionally, there's more support for legacy systems via implemented crypt(3) hashers and a fix for metadata patching has been deployed to ensure consistent user metadata management. For a detailed view of all changes, refer to the changelog on GitHub. Feedback and support are, as always, greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>This change adds a new delivery method to the courier called <code>mailer</code>. Similar to SMS functionality it posts a templated Data model to a API endpoint.  This API can then send emails via a CRM or any other mechanism that it wants.</p>
<p><code>Mailer</code> still uses the existing email data models so any new email added will automatically be sent to the API/CRM as well.</p>

<p><a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2023/06/life-before-cell-phones-internet-after-work.html">In a recent article</a> written for <em>Slate</em>, journalist Dan Kois recounts the shock his younger coworkers expressed when they discovered that he had, earlier in his career, earned a master’s degree while working a full-time job. “It was easy,” he explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I worked at a literary agency during the day, I got off work at 5 p.m., and I studied at night. The key was that this was just after the turn of the millennium. ‘But what would you do when you had work emails?’ these coworkers asked. ‘I didn’t get work emails,’ I said. ‘I barely had the internet in my apartment.'”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In his article, Kois goes on to interview other members of Generation X about their lives in the early 2000s, before the arrival of smartphones or even widely available internet. They shared tales of coming home and just watching whatever show happened to be on TV (maybe “Seventh Heaven,” or “Law and Order”). They also talked about going to the movies on a random weekday evening because they had nothing else to do, or just heading to a bar where they hoped to run into friends, and often would.</p>



<p>The threads that kept catching my attention, however, were about work communication. “The very idea that, once work hours were over, no one could get hold of you—via email, text, Slack, whatever—is completely alien to contemporary young people,” Kois explained. But this reality made a <em>huge</em> difference when it came to the perception of busyness and exhaustion. When work was done at work, and there was no chance of continuing your labors at home, your job didn’t seem nearly as all-consuming or onerous .</p>



<p>There’s a lot about early 2000s culture I’m not eager to excavate, but this idea of the constrained workday certainly seems worthy of nostalgia.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>DriveBC's Twitter account maxed out sharing crucial road condition information during a weekend of wildfire evacuations. Experts say it spells the end of social media as a reliable platform during an emergency.</p><div id="details-body" data-words="1143" itemprop="articleBody">
        <p>A B.C. government Twitter account updating residents about driving conditions reached its tweet limit on a weekend it&nbsp;was sharing information about&nbsp;wildfire evacuations.</p>

<p>The incident, which occurred earlier this month, prompted the Ministry of Transportation’s DriveBC account to issue a warning.</p>

<p>“HEADS UP - As many others have this weekend, <a href="https://twitter.com/DriveBC/status/1675600911782256640" target="_blank">@DriveBC</a> on Twitter and its sub accounts have exceeded the temporarily imposed post rate limit,” tweeted the ministry account July 2.</p>

<p>“We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause, and appreciate your patience while we work to resolve this issue going forward.”</p>

<p>The outage, first reported by CBC News, lasted little more than an hour but nevertheless has worried emergency preparedness experts, who say it's the&nbsp;latest sign that the&nbsp;once-reliable platform can no longer be counted on.</p>

<p>“It's kind of the end of public alerting through social media,” said Ryan Reynolds, an emergency preparedness consultant with Resilience Mapping Canada.</p>

<p>“These limits basically mean that we can't distribute that information quickly and easily at any scale.”</p>

<p>DriveBC has a dedicated <a href="https://drivebc.ca/" target="_blank">website</a>, but many access its automated messages through its Twitter account, a platform accessed by more than a quarter of Canadians in 2023, according to the company’s <a href="https://datareportal.com/reports/digital-2023-canada" target="_blank">advertising data</a>.</p>

<p>In the past, Twitter’s more than 370 million&nbsp;users have accessed the platform&nbsp;as a last bastion of critical information during social upheavals and disaster. It played a crucial role redirecting Pakistanis to a Red Crescent emergency help line during massive floods in 2022, and amplified emergency service information when Hurricane Ian struck Florida last September.</p>

<p>Since Elon Musk’s takeover of the platform, however, Twitter has put new rules in place that limit the number of automated tweets an account can send without paying. The move was carried out partly as a response to rising concerns artificial intelligence platforms would use the historical archives of social media platforms to train their large language models.</p>

<p>“We've been trying to use private infrastructure as public infrastructure for communications,” said Reynolds. “But it really doesn't work once things change.”</p>

<p>“We need to acknowledge that we still want to be where everyone is (so on social media), but we also need fallbacks that are much more reliable.”</p>

<h3>Other jurisdictions feeling pinch of Twitter’s new limits</h3>

<p>B.C. is far from the first jurisdiction to feel the effects of recent tweet limits. The U.S. National Weather Service uses Twitter to share hurricane and tornado alerts. But on July 4, its Boulder, Colo., bureau tweeted that rate limits meant it was unable to sift through tweets during active severe weather events.</p>

<p>“Due to issues with Twitter rate limits, we are unable to access most tweets at this time,” said NWS Boulder.</p>

<p>“Send reports to our other social media accounts or direct through our email/phone lines.”</p>

<p>Similar warnings were posted to the weather service’s bureaus in <a href="https://twitter.com/NWSWilmingtonNC/status/1675570926350651392?s=20" target="_blank">North Carolina</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/NWSWakefieldVA/status/1675258587206275073" target="_blank">Virginia</a>.</p>

<p>Some agencies have responded by cutting off their use of Twitter as a source of critical information. Last week, Dutch politicians told <a href="https://www.rappler.com/technology/social-media/twitter-not-suited-emergency-communications-dutch-say/" target="_blank">Reuters</a> Twitter had become an unreliable platform after the Netherlands’ most intense summer storm on record ripped through North Holland.</p>

<p>In New York, the <a href="https://new.mta.info/press-release/statement-mta-acting-chief-customer-shanifah-rieara-suspending-use-of-twitter-service" target="_blank">Metropolitan Transportation Authority</a> said in April it would suspend use of the platform for service alerts after it was twice locked out of the platform’s Application Programming Interface (API).</p>

<p>“The MTA has terminated posting service information to Twitter, effective immediately, as the reliability of the platform can no longer be guaranteed,” said North America’s largest transportation authority in a press release.</p>

<p>"The MTA does not pay tech platforms to publish service information and has built redundant tools that provide service alerts in real time.”</p>

<h3>Big disasters in big cities present&nbsp;largest risk</h3>

<p>Twitter’s API service limits tweets for non-paying users to 1,500 a month — not enough for many emergency accounts. And while a&nbsp;small fee for the platform's 'Blue Check' service will increase that ceiling for individual users, the cost of an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/21/23691784/elon-musk-twitter-disaster-alert-accounts-fire-storm-tsunami-earthquake" target="_blank">enterprise account</a> has reportedly climbed into the tens of thousands of dollars.</p>

<p>Twitter did not respond to Glacier Media's questions.</p>

<p>Reynolds says Twitter's recent posting limits will likely have a limited effect on communication during emergency events in smaller communities, simply because they are less likely to send out as many tweets.</p>

<p>But he worries what might happen during a major disaster, such as a powerful earthquake striking large population centres in Metro Vancouver or the Capital Regional District on southern Vancouver Island.</p>

<p>“For a place like say Metro Vancouver, that's going to be a very different story, where you're seeing potentially very large number of messages going out during an emergency,” Reynolds said.</p>

<p>Like many government information services, <a href="https://drivebc.ca/" target="_blank">DriveBC</a> and the <a href="https://wildfiresituation.nrs.gov.bc.ca/map" target="_blank">BC Wildfire Service</a> share information on their own websites. But Reynolds worries whether such websites could handle the surge in traffic should a disaster occur in a major population centre.</p>

<p>“That's the official way to get that message out,” he said of the websites. “It has to be bulletproof and support that messaging, but I'm not convinced that that's the case right now. There aren't really good alternatives yet.”</p>

<p>A spokesperson from Metro Vancouver said it plans to use a number of communication platforms to inform residents in an emergency — including the app <a href="https://alertable.ca/#/" target="_blank">Alertable</a>.</p>

<p>“Metro Vancouver is active on social media, but doesn’t rely on any one platform or method to get important information out during an emergency,” said the spokesperson.</p>

<p>The B.C.'s Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure was not immediately available for comment.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Government playing catch-up with 'tech bros'</h3>

<p>Reynolds says he's worried regional, provincial and federal governments aren't taking household disaster preparedness seriously enough.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A former researcher at the University of British Columbia, Reynolds led the development of an <a href="https://www.nsnews.com/highlights/disaster-app-helps-bc-communities-plan-for-climate-fallout-4695240" target="_blank">emergency app</a> to prepare and warn British Columbians of everything from floods to tsunamis and fires.</p>

<p>Initially rolled out in seven communities on Vancouver Island, Reynolds planned to scale up the app across B.C. But the province turned down two of his grant applications and he says the project, developed after years of community-level research, will become “dead” unless&nbsp;Public Safety Canada picks it up.</p>

<p>“That's a concern for me,” he said. “We need to have either a Canadian alerting app that is send only — the part of Twitter that we need for emergency management — or we need to reinforce the alternative approaches.”</p>

<p>Reynolds said that could come through partnering with the U.S. and Mexico or even NATO so Canada doesn’t have to “reinvent the wheel.”</p>

<p>In the meantime, apps like <a href="https://www.alertready.ca/" target="_blank">Alert Ready</a> offer a good option to receive emergency alerts, but they have their limits when it comes to preparing households beforehand, said Reynolds.</p>

<p>“We're losing these other passive solutions. We don't really have a great replacement for them right now,” he said. “This is just the privatization of social media, and the kind of balkanization of social media that we weren't anticipating.”</p>

<p>“Emergency management moves at a much slower rate than tech bros.”</p>

<h2 id="battalion">Battalion</h2>
<p><img src="https://cyber.dabamos.de/unix/x11/battalion.gif" alt="battalion" height="530" width="650"></p><p>Battalion is a 3D game from 1994, originally written for the Silicon Graphics
Indy UNIX workstation. The player controls a monster to blow up a city. The
author dedicated a
<a href="https://www.evl.uic.edu/aej/AndyBattalion.html">website</a> to the
game.</p>

<p>Depending on the perspective, the controls are a little awkward. You may
want to change the camera with key <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>,
<code>3</code>, or <code>4</code>. Use the mouse to rotate and to move
forward/backward. The arrow keys only work if the mouse cursor is placed in the
center of the screen. Shoot with the left control key or the left mouse button,
and tilt the head with <code>A</code> and <code>Z</code> to target helicopters
and jets. The camera can be rotated with <code>I</code>, <code>J</code>,
<code>K</code>, and <code>L</code>. Alter the rendering details with
<code>D</code>. Press <code>G</code> to grab the mouse cursor and
<code>P</code> to pause the game.</p>

<p>I made a quick &amp; dirty

<p>In a letter to the heads of <span><a href="https://apnews.com/hub/internal-revenue-service" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the IRS</a></span>, the Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission and the IRS watchdog, seven lawmakers say their findings “reveal a shocking breach of taxpayer privacy by tax prep companies and by Big Tech firms.” </p><p>Their report said highly personal and financial information about sources of taxpayers’ income, tax deductions and exemptions was made accessible to Meta as taxpayers used the tax software to prepare their taxes.</p>

<p>That data came to Meta through its Pixel code, which the tax firms installed on their websites to gather information on how to improve their own marketing campaigns. In exchange, Meta was able to access the data to write targeted algorithms for its own users. </p><p>The program collected information on taxpayers’ filing status, income, refund amounts, names of dependents, approximate federal tax owed, which buttons were clicked on the tax preparers’ websites and the names of text entry forms that the taxpayer navigated, the report states. </p><p>Taxpayer data was also shared with Google, through its own tracking tools — though the firm told lawmakers that it never used the information to track users on the internet, according to the report. </p><p>The letter to federal agencies was signed by Sens. Elizabeth Warren, Ron Wyden, Richard Blumenthal, Tammy Duckworth, Bernie Sanders, Sheldon Whitehouse and Rep. Katie Porter. The lawmakers called for the agencies to “immediately open an investigation into this incident.”</p>
    

<p>They ask the agencies to investigate “and prosecute any company or individuals who violated the law,” saying it could result in billions of dollars in criminal liability to the firms.</p><p>The Markup, a nonprofit journalism outlet focusing on technology, <span><a href="https://themarkup.org/pixel-hunt/2022/11/22/tax-filing-websites-have-been-sending-users-financial-information-to-facebook" target="_blank" rel="noopener">initially reported</a></span> on the data-sharing between tax firms and Meta in November. A TaxAct representative said the firm has engaged with Warren’s office to explain its usage of the analytical tools and that protecting customers is its top priority. </p><p>A TaxSlayer representative said Wednesday that the report “contains numerous false or misleading statements” regarding the taxpayers’ personal and filing information sent to Meta and Google and it will request a retraction or correction from Warren’s office. </p><p>H&amp;R Block said that it takes protecting client privacy very seriously and has taken steps to prevent the sharing of information through the Pixel coding.</p><p>And Meta said that it has been clear in its policies that advertisers “should not send sensitive information about people through our Business Tools.”</p><p>“Doing so is against our policies and we educate advertisers on properly setting up Business tools to prevent this from occurring,” the company said in an emailed statement. “Our system is designed to filter out potentially sensitive data it is able to detect.”</p>
    

<p>Meta’s Facebook has a history of failure when it comes to protecting user privacy. </p><p>One of its <span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/e0e0df2083fe40c0b0ad10ff1946f041" target="_blank" rel="noopener">biggest scandals erupted in 2018 when investigations revealed that Cambridge Analytica,</a></span> a firm with ties to Donald Trump’s onetime political strategist Steve Bannon, had paid a Facebook app developer for access to the personal information of about 87 million Facebook users. That data was then used to target U.S. voters during the 2016 campaign that culminated in Trump’s election as the 45th president.</p><p>Facebook agreed to a $725 million user settlement in that case, and later was <span><a href="https://apnews.com/general-news-7fa2c8a26b34436d89a1c7aff9914f70" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fined $5 billion</a></span> by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.</p><p>This May, the FTC proposed <span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/facebook-kids-messenger-ftc-privacy-children-6158aa59dee25c473e49f7df16f502ec" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sweeping new changes</a></span> to its standing privacy order for Meta that would bar the company from using any data collected from children under 18, including via its virtual reality technologies. The new rules would also force Meta to pause new products and services until an independent assessor confirms that they comply with the FTC order. The under-18 concerns stem largely from Facebook’s Messenger for Kids app, which has long drawn fire for insufficient privacy protections for its younger users.</p><p>Also in 2018, the company disclosed that <span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/65986276c04449ffb3e795ce0eef29d4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">almost 50 million accounts</a></span> had been vulnerable to the theft of digital “user tokens” that attackers could use to log into personal accounts.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="article-body">
<p>Today, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) has added 802.11bb as a standard for light-based wireless communications. The publishing of the standard has been <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230712214664/en/Global-LiFi-Firms-Welcome-the-Release-of-IEEE-802.11bb-Global-Light-Communications-Standard" data-url="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230712214664/en/Global-LiFi-Firms-Welcome-the-Release-of-IEEE-802.11bb-Global-Light-Communications-Standard">welcomed</a> by global Li-Fi businesses, as it will help speed the rollout and adoption of the &nbsp;data-transmission technology standard.</p><p>Advantages of using light rather than radio frequencies (RF) are highlighted by Li-Fi proponents including pureLiFi, Fraunhofer HHI, and the Light Communications 802.11bb Task Group. Li-Fi is said to deliver “faster, more reliable wireless communications with unparalleled security compared to conventional technologies such as Wi-Fi and 5G.” Now that the IEEE 802.11bb Li-Fi standard has been released, it is hoped that interoperability between Li-Fi systems with the successful Wi-Fi will be fully addressed.</p><p>Of course, Li-Fi isn’t going to sweep away Wi-Fi and 5G alternatives (nor wired networks). Radio waves still have a distinct advantage with regard to transmission through the atmosphere at great distance, and though opaque objects. Instead, work must concentrate on using horses for courses – with Li-Fi advantages being harvested where possible.</p><div data-nosnippet=""><p><iframe data-lazy-priority="high" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kDqA1-ldTOI" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div><p>In the Fraunhofer HHI video above you can see a Li-Fi system re-using a building’s lighting infrastructure for data. Don’t worry, the lights don’t visibly blink or flash, as the data transmission uses part of the infrared spectrum.</p><p>Where Li-Fi shines (pun intended) is not just in its purported speeds <a href="https://lifi.co/lifi-speed/" data-url="https://lifi.co/lifi-speed/">as fast as 224 GB/s</a>. Fraunhofer’s Dominic Schulz points out that as it works in an exclusive optical spectrum, this ensures higher reliability and lower latency and jitter. Moreover “Light’s line-of-sight propagation enhances security by preventing wall penetration, reducing jamming and eavesdropping risks, and enabling centimetre-precision indoor navigation,” says Shultz.</p><figure data-bordeaux-image-check=""><div><p><picture><source type="image/webp" alt="pureLiFi Light Antenna ONE module" onerror="if(this.src &amp;&amp; this.src.indexOf('missing-image.svg') !== -1){return true;};this.parentNode.replaceChild(window.missingImage(),this)" data-normal="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/tomshardware/media/img/missing-image.svg" data-srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/59Vxt7JgAzAXun92orxpS4-320-80.jpg.webp 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/59Vxt7JgAzAXun92orxpS4-480-80.jpg.webp 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/59Vxt7JgAzAXun92orxpS4-650-80.jpg.webp 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/59Vxt7JgAzAXun92orxpS4-970-80.jpg.webp 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/59Vxt7JgAzAXun92orxpS4-1024-80.jpg.webp 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/59Vxt7JgAzAXun92orxpS4-1200-80.jpg.webp 1200w" data-sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)" data-original-mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/59Vxt7JgAzAXun92orxpS4.jpg" data-pin-media="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/59Vxt7JgAzAXun92orxpS4.jpg"><source type="image/jpeg" alt="pureLiFi Light Antenna ONE module" onerror="if(this.src &amp;&amp; this.src.indexOf('missing-image.svg') !== -1){return true;};this.parentNode.replaceChild(window.missingImage(),this)" data-normal="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/tomshardware/media/img/missing-image.svg" data-srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/59Vxt7JgAzAXun92orxpS4-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/59Vxt7JgAzAXun92orxpS4-480-80.jpg 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/59Vxt7JgAzAXun92orxpS4-650-80.jpg 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/59Vxt7JgAzAXun92orxpS4-970-80.jpg 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/59Vxt7JgAzAXun92orxpS4-1024-80.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/59Vxt7JgAzAXun92orxpS4-1200-80.jpg 1200w" data-sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)" data-original-mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/59Vxt7JgAzAXun92orxpS4.jpg" data-pin-media="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/59Vxt7JgAzAXun92orxpS4.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/59Vxt7JgAzAXun92orxpS4.jpg" alt="pureLiFi Light Antenna ONE module" onerror="if(this.src &amp;&amp; this.src.indexOf('missing-image.svg') !== -1){return true;};this.parentNode.replaceChild(window.missingImage(),this)" data-normal="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/tomshardware/media/img/missing-image.svg" data-srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/59Vxt7JgAzAXun92orxpS4-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/59Vxt7JgAzAXun92orxpS4-480-80.jpg 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/59Vxt7JgAzAXun92orxpS4-650-80.jpg 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/59Vxt7JgAzAXun92orxpS4-970-80.jpg 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/59Vxt7JgAzAXun92orxpS4-1024-80.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/59Vxt7JgAzAXun92orxpS4-1200-80.jpg 1200w" data-sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)" data-original-mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/59Vxt7JgAzAXun92orxpS4.jpg" data-pin-media="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/59Vxt7JgAzAXun92orxpS4.jpg" srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/59Vxt7JgAzAXun92orxpS4-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/59Vxt7JgAzAXun92orxpS4-480-80.jpg 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/59Vxt7JgAzAXun92orxpS4-650-80.jpg 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/59Vxt7JgAzAXun92orxpS4-970-80.jpg 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/59Vxt7JgAzAXun92orxpS4-1024-80.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/59Vxt7JgAzAXun92orxpS4-1200-80.jpg 1200w"></picture></p></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description"><span itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: pureLiFi)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Now the IEEE 802.11bb standard is published, manufacturers can have greater confidence in the ecosystem and start integrating the tech, where suitable.

<p>General availability of GitHub’s merge queue means good-bye to traffic jams on your team’s busiest branches. No more rushing to merge your pull requests before someone else merges theirs 🥵. Turn on GitHub’s merge queue today and accelerate your merge velocity 🚀.</p>
<p>Any team that is part of a managed organization with public repositories and GitHub Enterprise Cloud users will be able to enable this feature on their respective repository and start streamlining their team’s pull requests immediately. If this describes you, then let the commit parties commence 🎉.</p>
<h2 id="introducing-merge-queue-our-newest-feature-to-improve-team-velocity">Introducing merge queue: our newest feature to improve team velocity<a href="#introducing-merge-queue-our-newest-feature-to-improve-team-velocity" aria-label="Introducing merge queue: our newest feature to improve team velocity"></a></h2>
<p>Collaborative coding is powerful. But to be at your team’s most optimized state, you need automated branch management that enables multiple developers to commit code on a daily basis, without frustration. This can happen if your team’s branch is busy with many team members onboarding the same commit onramp. This can be frustrating for your team, but, more importantly, it gets in the way of shipping velocity.&nbsp; We don’t want that journey for you!</p>
<p>This is why we built merge queue. We’ve reduced the tension between branch stability and velocity. Merge queue takes care of making sure your pull request is compatible with other changes ahead of it and alerting you if something goes wrong. The result: your team can focus on the good stuff—write, submit, and commit.&nbsp; No tool sprawls here. This flow is still in the same place with the enablement of a modified merge button because GitHub remains your one-stop-shop for an integrated, enterprise-ready platform with the industry’s best collaboration tools.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-merge-queue-work">How does merge queue work?<a href="#how-does-merge-queue-work" aria-label="How does merge queue work?"></a></h2>
<p>

		</p>
<p>Merge queue is designed for high-performance teams where multiple users regularly commit to a single branch. Prior to merge queue, engineers would need to attempt to merge directly onto an already busy branch—potentially running into code conflicts, and then spiraling into a cycle of rework.</p>
<p>With GitHub’s merge queue, a temporary branch is created that contains:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">The latest changes from the base branch</li>
<li aria-level="1">The changes from other pull requests already in the queue</li>
<li aria-level="1">The changes from your pull request</li>
</ul>
<p>CI then starts, with the expectation that all required status checks must pass before the branch (and the pull requests it represents) are merged. Merge queue is the ultimate branch traffic controller.</p>
<p>We’re thrilled that Block, one of our enterprise customers, has been unlocking the magic of this streamlined workflow–queue-then-next-play.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>We would routinely experience post-merge build failures in our monorepo several times a week and merge queue has practically eliminated all build failures in that category. This has greatly reduced our on-call burden and lessened the friction our developers’ experience during their daily workflows.</p></blockquote><figcaption> - Jon Graves, Engineering Manager at Block Inc</figcaption></figure>

<p>Enhance your team’s performance and speed by enabling this new branch protection.</p>
<p>As a repository administrator:</p>
<ul>
<li>For your target branch, <strong>enable the branch protection setting</strong>, “Require merge queue.”</li>
<li><strong>Set your preferences</strong> for the merge queue: merge method, build on currency, merge limits, only merge non-failing pull requests, status check timeout.</li>
</ul>
<p>As an engineer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open the pull request to be added to the queue, click ‘<strong>Merge when ready’</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>We’ve all come across a LEGO set from childhood and felt the temptation to try building it one more time — making the generous assumption, of course, that all the pieces are in the box, to say nothing of the instructions. If you’re missing a few bricks, you can always turn to the robust secondary market in LEGO components. If you’re missing the manual, there’s now one place you should look first: <a href="https://archive.org/details/lego-set-instructions?utm_source=join1440&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;sort=-week&amp;page=4">the LEGO building instructions collection at the Internet Archive</a>. There you’ll find digitized materials for more than 6,800 different sets, including such popular releases as the <a href="https://archive.org/details/lego-building-instructions-10304">LEGO Chevrolet Camaro Z28</a>, the <a href="https://archive.org/details/lego-building-instructions-21321/21321_A_Digital%20Booklet%20-%20DE/">LEGO International Space Station</a>, and the <a href="https://archive.org/details/lego-building-instructions-31198">LEGO cover photo of <em>Meet the Beatles</em></a>.</p>

<p>Since they were first brought to market in the late nineteen-fifties, LEGO’s signature building bricks have been primarily considered children’s toys. And of course, most of us got to know LEGO in childhood; I myself have fond memories of working my way up to the <a href="https://ramblingbrick.com/2021/02/14/an-ice-place-to-be-revisiting-ice-planet-2002/">Ice Planet 2002 series</a>, with its still much-referenced transparent orange chainsaws.</p>


<p>But even after coming of age, the serious enthusiast need not leave LEGO behind: the company has put out such adult-oriented models as <a href="https://amzn.to/3A3R6aI">the Colosseum</a>, <a href="https://amzn.to/43kNFtT">Andy Warhol’s Marilyn Monroe</a>, <a href="https://amzn.to/44JkZM6">the Eiffel Tower</a>, and <a href="https://amzn.to/3NHNUt6">the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum</a>, to name just a few whose instructions are downloadable from the Internet Archive.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.metafilter.com/199906/LEGO-Building-Instructions">The Metafilter discussion of the Internet Archive’s LEGO building instructions collection</a> reveals not only that some are excited indeed about the existence of this resource, but also that others consider building from instructions to be a misuse of the medium. It may be true that following specific documented steps for hours on end may encourage a certain slackening of the imagination. But then, it may also be true that physically working one’s way through a complex assembly process can build dexterity and generate ideas for later freeform constructions. However we approach LEGO, and whatever age at which we approach it, we need only keep in mind the Danish imperative that gave the company its name: <em>leg godt </em>— play well. Enter the collection of instructions here.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.openttd.org/news/2023/07/08/our-infrastructure">https://www.openttd.org/news/2023/07/08/our-infrastructure</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36706453">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
        <p>This post is part of a two-part series, of which this is the first.
In this post, we go a bit into the infrastructure that runs OpenTTD, from BaNaNaS to our main website.
The <a href="https://www.openttd.org/news/2023/07/09/infra-migration">second post</a> will explain a bit about the migration we just did to get to this infrastructure.</p>

<p>Often I get comments that people are surprised how complex OpenTTD’s infrastructure is, and why that is.
With this post, I will try to explain a bit what is going on in the backend, and why it takes a bit of effort to keep everything running smoothly.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>The question: how does OpenTTD’s infrastructure look, or even: why is it so complex, is a rather complicated question to answer in a few words.
The most accurate answer to the first is: look at over yourself in our <a href="https://github.com/OpenTTD/infra">Infrastructure-as-Code</a> repository.
But that is hardly helping anyone understand the concepts.</p>

<p>I will highlight some of the services we use from providers like AWS, Cloudflare, etc, and what backend services we deliver ourself.</p>

<h2 id="providers-and-their-services">Providers and their services</h2>

<p>To build OpenTTD’s infrastructure, we try to reuse as many existing components as possible.
Sadly, as we have a very specific need, this isn’t always possible.
Take for example our in-game content service (called BaNaNaS): this has to be custom made, as there is no service like it.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, even those services use as many existing components as possible.
To give you a bit of a feel for it, let’s delve into a few of them.</p>

<h3 id="cloudflare-pages">Cloudflare Pages</h3>

<p><a href="https://pages.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare Pages</a> allows hosting of a website over HTTP(S).
You upload HTML pages, and it takes care of the rest.</p>

<p>It has one drawback: it is meant for (mostly) static sites.
This is changing quickly with the integration with Cloudflare Workers (see below), but even then it is not meant for fully dynamic sites, like BaNaNaS, server-listing, etc.</p>

<p>We use Cloudflare Pages for everything that is mostly static.
This includes our main webpage, the survey-results, but also OpenTTD’s Pull Request Previews.</p>

<h3 id="cloudflare-r2">Cloudflare R2</h3>

<p>All binary files are stored in <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/products/r2/">Cloudflare R2</a>, basically a bucket service.
All BaNaNaS content, releases, nightlies, etc: they all go here.</p>

<p>None of our R2 buckets are connected directly to a public domain; there is always a Cloudflare Worker in between, making sure the requests are valid, making sure our CDN feels like directory listing, etc etc.</p>

<p>One important note here is, that Cloudflare’s access sucks balls (sorry, there really isn’t any reason to sugarcoat this one).
There isn’t any RBAC yet, which means that if you create an API token for Cloudflare R2 with Write access, it can write in EVERY BUCKET, including the deletion of files.
This of course is a potential security issue, as we need our services (like BaNaNaS, or when we make a new nightly) to write in those buckets, and that code can make mistakes (we are all human after all).
To harden things a bit more, even writing a new file to R2 is done via a Cloudflare Worker.
An interesting fact is that a Cloudflare Worker can be bound to a single R2 bucket, where it cannot access any other.</p>

<p>This is really the only real complaint I have about Cloudflare; although AWS’s IAM is far far better, if we consider AWS’s IAM all the way on the right side of the access rights spectrum, Cloudflare’s API tokens are far on the left.
There is a lot of room between those two, and I hope Cloudflare addresses that soon.
Either way, slapping a simple Cloudflare Worker between it really isn’t the biggest problem.</p>

<h3 id="cloudflare-workers">Cloudflare Workers</h3>

<p><a href="https://workers.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare Workers</a> allows running small pieces of Javascript or WASM in the Cloudflare network, to handle HTTP(S) traffic.
It can do all kinds of things, like serving files from Cloudflare R2, redirect traffic, cache pages, and much more.</p>

<p>In that sense they are very similar to AWS Lambdas, just way more powerful.</p>

<p>Almost all our websites have a Cloudflare Worker in front of them to handle one thing or the other.
For example, when you visit <a href="https://forum.openttd.org/">https://forum.openttd.org</a> you end up on a Cloudflare Worker, which returns a redirect message.
But also our <a href="https://cdn.openttd.org/">CDN</a> makes use of a Cloudflare Worker: R2 (and any bucket service for that matter) normally doesn’t serve <code>index.html</code> when you visit a folder.
But to give the CDN the look and feel of a directory listing, it is important that it does.
This is what the Cloudflare Worker is taking care of.
If you visit a folder, it actually requests the <code>index.html</code> and serves that; it looks to you like it is listing a directory, but in fact it is just serving a HTML file.</p>

<h3 id="nomad">Nomad</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.nomadproject.io/">Nomad</a> is similar to Kubernetes, AWS ECS, AWS EKS, Azure AKS, etc, but a bit simpler to work with in a day-to-day.
Where in Kubernetes you can do everything, Nomad is more opinionated, and because of that does a lot more things for you.</p>

<p>A nomad cluster consists of different nodes, or Nomad clients.
A client can run jobs, which either can be a script, or a container, or really anything.</p>

<p>In total we run five Nomad clients for OpenTTD:</p>
<ul>
  <li>2 public facing clients.</li>
  <li>3 internal clients.</li>
</ul>

<p>All clients are hosted on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/t4/">AWS EC2 T4g</a> instance, the cheapest EC2 instances AWS has.
This type is an ARM64.</p>

<p>To keep the AWS infrastructure as cheap as possible, we wanted to avoid needing a NAT gateway: if you use IPv4, you need something that allows you to talk with the outside world.
On AWS you do this by installing NAT gateways.
Sadly, those are (relatively speaking) rather expensive.
So instead, we run as much as we can IPv6-only.
This allows us to use an egress-only gateway, which avoids the need for a NAT gateway.
There are a few issues with using IPv6-only, but we will touch on that in a second.</p>

<p>Ideally we would do without the two public facing clients, but this is not possible (yet).
Although we can route all our HTTP(S) traffic via Cloudflare (see below), our custom TCP protocols can not.</p>

<p>To solve this, there are two solutions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Either use an AWS service (read: AWS’s NLB), which costs 30 USD a month.</li>
  <li>Or build a Network Load Balancer yourself.</li>
</ul>

<p>We picked the second option here, and run our own NLB on the two public facing clients.
Nomad made this painfully simple, and took only a few to set up properly.</p>

<p>The other issue to solve for any cluster, is service discovery.
Nomad’s built-in service discovery helps out a lot, but it leaves for a last mile: how does an external connection know where a service is running.
For this we run nginx on all clients in the cluster.
Nginx uses Nomad’s service discovery information to forward traffic to the right instance.
As example, if a service is running on port 12001 on client B, the nginx on all clients are configured to accept a connection on localhost on port 12001, and redirect this to the correct service.
This makes it very simple to route information, and Nomad automatically updates the configuration when it changes.
This means that if a service is restarted, and launches on client C for example, the nginx is automatically reconfigured to forward all traffic to client C now.</p>

<p>Lastly, most services work with a canary: this means that when a service is updated, first a new instance is launched.
If this turns out to run stable, nginx is reconfigured to use this new instance.
Only then the old instance is shut down.
This should, in theory, gives the least amount of downtime possible.
Even during software updates.</p>

<h3 id="cloudflare-access">Cloudflare Access</h3>

<p>To reduce the attack surface on our infrastructure, only the two public facing clients have open ports from the Internet.
And only those ports used for our custom TCP protocols are opened.
Everything else is kept internal, including the communication with Cloudflare.</p>

<p>For Cloudflare to talk to our Nomad cluster, we use <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/access/">Cloudflare Access</a>.
Or, more specifically, <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/products/tunnel/">Cloudflare Tunnels</a>, part of Cloudflare Access.</p>

<p>All three internal clients run an <code>cloudflared</code> instance, which creates several outbound connections (over IPv6) to connect to several Cloudflare Point-of-Presence (PoP).
Via this connection, Cloudflare can talk to our internal services and back.
The way Cloudflare Tunnels and our Nomad cluster works, means it is very resilient to outages:</p>
<ul>
  <li>As <code>cloudflared</code> is connected to at least three PoPs, if one goes down, the other two take over instantly.</li>
  <li>When one of the Nomad clients drops, or is replaced, there are at least two more Nomad clients that run <code>cloudflared</code>, and Cloudflare will use them instantly.
This means you, as end-user, notice as little as possible from updates, outages, crashes, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>An example: say you visit <a href="https://bananas.openttd.org/">https://bananas.openttd.org/</a>.
You first enter Cloudflare, which uses one of the three tunnels to reach one of the three internal clients.
Here, nginx picks up the connection, and routes you to the actual service running in the Nomad cluster.</p>

<p>It is impossible to create a direct HTTP(S) connection to our backend services from the Internet.
It is always routed via Cloudflare.
The benefit of this is that Cloudflare has their <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/waf/">Web Application Firewall</a> running on our HTTP(S) communication.
This means that if people want to play nasty and find issues in our services, they first need to bypass Cloudflare’s WAF.
And this is not an easy thing to do.</p>

<h3 id="internal-traffic-is-ipv6-only">Internal traffic is IPv6-only</h3>

<p>As mentioned above, all internal traffic is IPv6-only.
It is only Cloudflare and the two public facing Nomad clients that listen on IPv4.</p>

<p>There are a few challenges here.
The database for the BaNaNaS backend services is hosted on github.com, and github.com sadly doesn’t listen on any IPv6 address.
Similar for Sentry (which we use to monitor for errors in the backend services) and Discord.</p>

<p>To overcome this problem, where we can’t talk over IPv6 to these services, we have several proxies running on the Cloudflare network to close this gap.
Basically, we don’t call github.com, but we call github-proxy.openttd.org.
Cloudflare routes the request to github.com over IPv4, and everyone is happy.</p>

<p>Owh, and no, you cannot use those proxies yourself.
We whitelisted those proxies on Cloudflare Access to only the IPv6 range used by our Nomad cluster.
Sorry (not sorry).</p>

<h2 id="openttds-backends">OpenTTD’s Backends</h2>

<p>So now we all talk the same language for the providers and their services used, let’s touch upon our own backends.
We will not go in too much detail on those; if you want to know more, I suggest looking up the repositories involved.</p>

<h3 id="bananas-in-game-content-service">BaNaNaS (in-game content-service)</h3>

<p>All our content is stored on Cloudflare R2.
There are three backend services involved:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/OpenTTD/bananas-api">API</a>, serving a JSON-based REST API for listing and manipulating BaNaNaS content.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/OpenTTD/bananas-frontend-web/">web</a>, serving <a href="https://bananas.openttd.org/">https://bananas.openttd.org/</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/OpenTTD/bananas-server">server</a>, serving the custom TCP protocol and the HTTP indexer.</li>
</ul>

<p>The API can read/write to the R2, and the server can read from it.
The web only uses the API to do its thing.</p>

<p>The HTTP indexer in the server should be moved up to a Cloudflare Worker, and it should only serve the custom TCP protocol.
But this is future work.</p>

<p>As we really like to support older clients for as long as we can, we also have to deal with some silly choices we made in, for example, OpenTTD 0.7.
One of those choices is that the HTTP indexer has to be reachable via HTTP (besides HTTPS), and also listened on <a href="https://binaries.openttd.org/">https://binaries.openttd.org/</a>.
This domain has been deprecated for years now, as it is not really descriptive in what it does.
But as we still want to make sure if you start OpenTTD 0.7, you can still use BaNaNaS, it still exists, and still does its job.
In this specific case, there is a Cloudflare Worker redirect the traffic from one domain to the other.
And in OpenTTD 14 and later, it will use HTTPS instead of HTTP.</p>

<p>On the topic of HTTP vs HTTPS: OpenTTD’s infrastructure makes HTTPS mandatory, with the exception of BaNaNaS.
For the above mentioned reasons.
It is hard to let go …</p>

<h3 id="multiplayer">Multiplayer</h3>

<p>The multiplayer is composed of two parts: an old (pre-12.0) part and a new part.
Between all different components we use <a href="https://redis.io/">Redis</a> to communicate.
This makes it so you can see both old and new servers in the server-listing, despite them incapable of talking to each other directly.</p>

<p>The best thing about the whole multiplayer, you can shut everything down, and wipe the Redis database.
But after startup, it will be populated with the correct data again in minutes.
Basically, it doesn’t need any persistent storage, and as such, it doesn’t have any.
This kind of architecture makes it very easy to deal with, as problems only exists temporarily.
Even in the worst case, a restart brings everything back up and running again.</p>

<p>The services involved here are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/OpenTTD/game-coordinator">coordinator</a>, handling 12.0+ servers and clients.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/OpenTTD/master-server">master</a>, handling pre-12.0 servers and clients, and hosts the API.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/OpenTTD/master-server-web">web</a>, serving <a href="https://servers.openttd.org/">https://servers.openttd.org/</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Needless to say, here too, Cloudflare Workers should take over the API from master, as that is currently just a bit silly how it is implemented.
It can also take over the web part completely, as it is just simple listing.
But this too, future work.</p>

<h3 id="cdn-releases-etc">CDN (releases, etc)</h3>

<p><a href="https://cdn.openttd.org/">https://cdn.openttd.org/</a> contains all our releases ever made.
Every nightly (or at least the source), is available as far back as 2004.
Release 0.1.1 can be found there.</p>

<p>I hope obvious by now, this is hosted on Cloudflare R2, with a Cloudflare Worker in front of it.
The Worker deals with GET requests, and make sure you see a nice directory listing when you visit the website.
But is also deals with PUT requests, to add new files.</p>

<p>These PUT requests need a <code>X-Signature</code>, to validate you are allowed to upload new files.
This signature is signed with a private/public RSA-key, where only the services that need to upload files know the private part.</p>

<p>For example, <a href="https://github.com/OpenTTD/OpenTTD">https://github.com/OpenTTD/OpenTTD</a> has a GitHub Secret called <code>CDN_SIGNING_KEY</code>, which can only be used to upload files in <code>openttd-releases</code> and <code>openttd-nightlies</code>.
This gives us a bit security that not just everyone can upload files, and prevents accident in scripts to delete or overwrite files; as this is simply impossible.</p>

<h3 id="other-services-translator-dorpsgek-website-wiki">Other services (translator, DorpsGek, website, wiki)</h3>

<p>There are a ton of other services, like <a href="https://github.com/OpenTTD/eints">translator</a>, <a href="https://github.com/OpenTTD/DorpsGek">DorpsGek</a> (our Discord / IRC bot), the <a href="https://github.com/OpenTTD/website">website</a>, <a href="https://github.com/TrueBrain/TrueWiki">wiki</a>, etc.</p>

<p>None of them are really all that interesting.</p>

<p>Translator and DorpsGek run in Nomad.
The wiki does too, but Cloudflare caches as much as possible (as it is purely an HTTPS website; just very dynamic).
The website is fully done in Cloudflare Pages: the GitHub workflow uploads a new site every day directly to Cloudflare Pages.</p>

<h3 id="other-bits-and-pieces-docs-preview-redirects">Other bits and pieces (docs, preview, redirects)</h3>

<p>So much more services we run to make things easier.</p>

<p>We publish the documentation on <a href="https://docs.openttd.org/">https://docs.openttd.org/</a>.
This is done when a new nightly is produced, and uploaded to a Cloudflage Pages.</p>

<p>We also allow OpenTTD Pull Requests to be previewed.
The WASM version of OpenTTD is also uploaded to Cloudflare Pages, but as a branch.
And a Cloudflare Worker on <a href="https://preview.openttd.org/">https://preview.openttd.org/</a> loads the right branch to serve you the latest preview.
This in combination with <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/targeting-different-environments/using-environments-for-deployment">GitHub Deployments</a>, gives you a nice “View Deployment” button to press on Pull Requests.</p>

<p>Lastly, we have a ton of domains that simply redirect.
<a href="https://bugs.openttd.org/task/1">https://bugs.openttd.org/task/1</a> redirects to the GitHub issue, <a href="https://forum.openttd.org/">https://forum.openttd.org/</a> points you to the subforum on tt-forums.net, etc.
The list is long, and not all that interesting.</p>

<h2 id="wrap-up">Wrap-up</h2>

<p>I hope that with this post you have a bit more insight what is actually going on in OpenTTD’s infrastructure, and that it is not a simple website.
In total, we store over 150GiB of data, transfer over 6TiB of data monthly, have more than 10M requests a month, and serve thousands of unique visitors every week.</p>

<p>If, after reading this story, you still have questions or are just curious, feel free to drop by on <a href="https://discord.gg/openttd">Discord</a> in <code>#openttd-development</code> and ask your question.
Or if you just want to express your happiness with the insight this post gave you, you are also very welcome!</p>

<!-- intro -->

        <h2 id="intro">What's dt? <a href="#intro">⌾</a></h2>
        <p>
          dt is a utility and programming language. The utility is intended for
          ergonomic in-the-shell execution. The language is straightforward
          (in the most literal sense) with a minimal syntax that allows for
          high-level, higher-order programming.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's meant to supplement (<i>not replace!</i>) other tools like awk,
          sed, xargs, and shell built-ins. Something like the Perl one-liners
          popular yesteryear, but hopefully easier to read and reason through.
        </p>
        <p>
          In particular dt is intended to be generally useful, with zero
          pretense of elegance. The philosophy might be summed up with some
          <a href="https://www.redgreen.com/">Red Green</a> quotes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>If it ain't broke, you're not trying.</li>
          <li>...the handyman's secret weapon, duct tape.</li>
          <li>This is only temporary, unless it works.</li>
          <li>Spare the duct tape, spoil the job.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          dt is released as open source software, usable under the (permissive)
          terms of <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause">
          the BSD 3-Clause license</a>.
        </p>

        <h4>Excuse me, is it "duct" or "duck" tape?</h4>
        <p>
          I mean sure, "duct tape" and "duck tape" are both fine. "Duct tape"
          is the more common name today. The older name is "duck tape" after
          the duck cloth under the adhesive.
        </p>
        <p><i>
          As an aside: If you care about such things, make sure to read up on
          how today's common version became popular. A 51-year-old woman named
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vesta_Stoudt">Vesta Stoudt</a>,
          mother of 8, mailed her idea for a better ammunition box seal to the
          president (who approved production) after her bosses didn't do
          anything with the suggestion.
        </i></p>

        $ dt   \\pls usage pls   quit
        ( [&lt;a&gt;] -- ) Print the values of the most recent quote, each followed by a newline, to standard output.
        </pre>

        <p>
          In dt, everything is evaluated left-to-right. This means we don't
          write "3 + 4" because the "+" wouldn't have enough information to add
          yet. Instead we write <span>3 4 +</span>.
        </p>
        <pre>        $ dt 3 4 + pl   quit
        7
        </pre>

        <p>
          All commands are evaluated left-to-right, including <span>def</span>
          which is a command that defines more commands. In dt, a command
          is a binding to a value or a "quote" of values and commands. In other
          words, a command is what other languages call functions, variables,
          procedures, subroutines, bindings, etc. Some commands are built-in,
          others are defined in dt source code. Anyway let's
          <span>def</span> some stuff to use it. (I'm going to
          feed the code as a single string to avoid escapes, and assume a
          shell that can interpret multiline strings.)
        </p>
        <pre>        $ dt '3 \three def
              4 \four def
              [+ pl] \add-and-print def
              three four add-and-print
              quit'
        7
        </pre>
        <p>
          Above you can see we bound <span>3</span> to a new
          command <span>three</span> and did similar for
          <span>four</span>. These are like variables, but
          can also be thought of as a command that produces a single value.
        </p>
        <p>
          Above you can also see we bound <span>+</span> and
          <span>pl</span> in sequence to a new command
          <span>add-and-print</span>. Calling this performed
          its two commands.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes you just want to bind as values that would not execute the
          code immediately (For example: to bind a quote as a list). for this
          we can use <span>:</span> to bind values.
        </p>
        <pre>        $ dt  3 4 [+ pl]   [three four add-and-print]: \
              three four add-and-print \
              status \
              quit
        [ 3 4 [ + pl ] ]
        </pre>
        <p>
          This bound three values to three identifiers. It didn't execute the
          last quotation though, it simply provided it again. Let's finish up
          by executing with <span>do</span>.
        </p>
        <pre>        $ dt  3 4 [+ pl]   [three four add-and-print]: \
              three four add-and-print \
              do \
              quit

<p dir="auto">Note that it still requires Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 or newer to be installed. Moving to clang/llvm soon :)</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Porting Xbox360 executables to Windows</h2>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/rexdex/recompiler/blob/master/_images/xbox_remcompiler.jpg"><img src="https://github.com/rexdex/recompiler/raw/master/_images/xbox_remcompiler.jpg" alt="DolphinDemoScreenshot"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The idea is simple: <em>what if you could take the Xbox360 game and run it on your PC?</em> Is this even possible in principle? I was pondering this question few years ago and that should not come as a surprise that there are some obvious technical difficulties in getting this done:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Different CPUs</strong> - Xbox360 uses PowerPC based CPU, our PCs are based on x86 architecture. They are different in so many ways that I don't even know where to start :) PowerPC is RISC based, has shitloads of registers but very simple instructions. x86 is totally different on the other hand - not so many registers and many more instructions that are more complicated (addressing modes...). It's obvious that a simple transcription is not feasible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Memory Layout</strong> - Xbox360 uses BigEndian byte ordering, x86 CPUs use LittleEndian. To be compatible with incoming data that is being read from files and read/written into the memory all memory based operands must be byteswapped. This may pose a significant performance issue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Encrypted executable image</strong> - Yup, for various reasons the executables on Xbox360 are encrypted. There are some cleaver guys in Russia though that figured how :)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Different and outdated GPU architecture</strong> - If we want to see any graphics rendered the GPU needs to be emulated. There are two hard nuts to crack: first, the shaders we see will be complied into the GPU compatible format, no HLSL on input, sorry. Those shaders will have to be reverse engineered as well. Secondly, the Xbox360 GPU was using ~10MB of internal memory called EDRAM that was serving as a temporary storage of render target for the duration of rendering. Although some cards today still use similar concept this is never exposed directly to the user. Since there a lot of different ways people used the EDRAM on Xbox this part has to be emulated. To be honest probably differently for every game.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Inlining of graphics/kernel functions</strong> - Some of the functions used while compiling the executable were inlined directly into the compiled code making it much harder to write a simple API level wrapper. This kills the dream of making "function level" wrapper where we could just go and wrap the "d3d-&gt;DrawPrimitive" call directly. Nope, this is not going to happen.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Fortunately, every problem is solvable and the answer is <em><strong>YES</strong></em> in principle. If you want to know how, keep reading :)</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Current state of the project</h2>
<p dir="auto">Currently the published branch of the project allows to run simple Xbox360 demo apps (samples). I've not yet attempted to run it with any real game as it probably would not work with anything big and serious. Also, on the legal side, this is a fine line because getting anything bigger is tricky as it requires going basically to the Torrent Sites and digging through old Xbox Live Arcade content or pirated game. Xbox360 is not yet abandonware :) For the same reason there are no source executables given, you need to get one "from somewhere". Sorry :(</p>
<p dir="auto">Stuff currently implemented:</p>
<p dir="auto"><em><strong>Backend</strong></em> (offline processing):</p>
<ul dir="auto">

<li>PowerPC instruction disassembly</li>
<li>Program blocks reconstruction</li>

<li><em>Time Machine</em> tool that makes it possible to find previous instruction that touched given register or memory</li>
</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How to run it ?</h2>
<p dir="auto">(NOTE: You require Visual Studio 2015 to build and use this project - at present it is entirely Windows-specific with regards to the code and the build process.)</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Get <code>wxWidgets 3.1.0</code> and compile it to obtain the x64 DLLs. Place them in <code>dev\external\wxWidgets-3.1.0\</code>.</li>
<li>Open the solution <code>recompile.sln</code> under <code>dev\src</code> with Visual Studio. This is the top-level VS solution that we will use to build the project.</li>
<li>Compile the whole solution. You should now have binaries and their associated symbols under <code>_bin\Debug</code> in your project root directory.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Now you have two ways to use a binary XEX file and obtain x86-64 code from it. The first way is to use the GUI, which can be launched using <code>recompiler_tools</code>. This way is straightforward - create a new project (or open an existing <code>.rep</code> project), add an image to it (this is your XEX file), and then use the toolbar to build the imported image. You will see a log window pop up and at the end of the process, you should be able to click on the <em>Run</em> button to run your newly recompiled binary.</p>
<p dir="auto">The second way is to use the command-line APIs as follows:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Run <code>recompiler_api -command=decompile -in=imagePath -out=outputPath</code> to decompile your image. <code>imagePath</code> should point to your XEX file, and <code>outputPath</code> should point to the folder where you want the output (uncompressed XEX, with the filename <code>output.pdi</code>) to go to.</li>
<li>Run <code>recompiler_api -command=recompile -in=pdiPath -out=outputPath -generator=cpp_msvc</code> to recompile the PDI output from the previous step into native code. At the end of the process you should have the recompiled binary, <code>code.bin</code> in <code>outputPath</code>.</li>
<li>Run <code>xenon_launcher -fsroot=dataPath -image=binPath</code> to launch the recompiled binary. <code>dataPath</code> refers to the folder where the assets of the binary can be found (example: <code>projects\xenon\dolphin</code> for the file <code>dolphin.xex</code>), and <code>binPath</code> is the location of the <code>.bin</code> file from the previous step.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">To exit the app (or end the <code>xenon_launcher</code> process), simply close the GPU output window.</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">XEX</h2>
<p dir="auto">First, the XEX (Xbox Executable) format must be ripped apart and the actual code has to be extracted. XEX is a Xbox360 specific executable packing/encryption format. It's not very complicated and quite good description can be found here: <a href="http://free60.org/wiki/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">Free60</a>. There are also some old references <a href="http://www.openrce.org/forums/posts/111" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Inside the XEX there are some platform specific headers (like file certificate, media/region information, file encryption key, etc) but also there's a normal
PE style executable, unfortunately it's packed and encrypted.</p>
<p dir="auto">Decryption of any actual executables requires knowing the secret AES key that is used internally by the loader to compute another AES key that is actually used to decrypt the file content. I found it on a Russian site few years ago but could not retrace my steps any more, most likely the site is down gone for good. The rest of the XEX format suggests strongly that it was basically built on top of existing PE image loader that existed in the OS. The compression used in the XEX is either simple block based compression or a variation of LZ compression. Both were identified and reversed years ago by people trying to break the Xbox360 anti-piracy protection.</p>
<p dir="auto">Anyway, after dealing with those two bumps on the road and unpacking the "internal EXE" from the XEX we follow normal disassembly procedure. In general case we end up with a list of sections:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content=".rdata   0x00000400-0x0004C100 r__
.pdata   0x0004C200-0x00053358 r__
.text    0x00060000-0x0026B158 r_x
.data    0x00270000-0x00289D50 rw_
.XBMOVIE 0x00289E00-0x00289E08 rw_
.idata   0x00290000-0x00290268 rw_
.XBLD    0x002A0000-0x002A0090 r__
.reloc   0x002A0200-0x002B2EF4 r__"><pre><code>.rdata   0x00000400-0x0004C100 r__
.pdata   0x0004C200-0x00053358 r__
.text    0x00060000-0x0026B158 r_x
.data    0x00270000-0x00289D50 rw_
.XBMOVIE 0x00289E00-0x00289E08 rw_
.idata   0x00290000-0x00290268 rw_
.XBLD    0x002A0000-0x002A0090 r__
.reloc   0x002A0200-0x002B2EF4 r__
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">The only section that contains executable code is the .text section and only that section requires disassembly. Rest of the sections must still be loaded into the memory when we try to execute the code since data may be read/written into those addresses. For now I did not implement any data relocation so the unpacked image must be loaded exactly under its base address. Fortunately on 64-bit systems this is achievable fairly easily.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Disassembly</h2>
<p dir="auto">Disassembling the PowerPC instructions is a pleasure. After we identify the .text (code) section in the PE executable the rest is straightforward. Every instruction is always 4 bytes so there is no ambiguity like with x86 instructions and even if we don't know how to decode a particular instruction we can easily continue with the rest of the code. This allows us to have semi-working solution way sooner than with x86. See the <a href="https://github.com/rexdex/recompiler/blob/master/dev/src/platforms/xenon/xenonDecompiler/xenonInstructionDecoding.cpp">actual file</a> for details.</p>
<p dir="auto">Basically in this project I've tried 3 ways to approach the subject:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">Script based (for faster iteration) - I've written a LUA script that was doing the disassembly. It was fast to iterate in small samples but very slow to run and disassemble millions of instructions in normal executables was taking minutes. Even to check if an instruction is valid instruction was taking way too much time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Data driven pattern matching - Basically a big XML with binary "rules" that were matching bit patterns and emitting instructions. This was much faster but because of the corner cases in the PowerPC instruction encoding it got messy in the end and required me to do a lot of copy-pasting. Performance wise it was fast and could work if not for a one little detail: it's not enough just to disassemble the code, we still need to extract some "metadata" out of the code (like register dependencies, calculated jump addresses, etc). This still requires us to know a little bit about the instruction that just its name. So, the template-based disassembler was producing an instruction named "bc" but I still had to write manual code to understand that it's a "conditional branch" and even more code to be able to evaluate this condition.</p>
</li>

<p dir="auto">Finally I ended up with an abstract CPUInstruction class that is implemented for every instruction that CPU implements + a big ass C++ switch() to do the disassembly. This is actually very nice and maintainable solution.</p>

<p dir="auto">The <em><strong>biggest</strong></em> and most valuable resources on this topic were the official PowerPC instruction set documentation: <a href="http://fileadmin.cs.lth.se/cs/education/EDAN25/PowerISA_V2.07_PUBLIC.pdf" rel="nofollow">Power ISA Version 2.07</a></p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Testing the disassembler</h2>
<p dir="auto">I had lots of bugs in the disassembler. Of course, I could write a unit test for each instruction but that would just take ages. The fastest way I've found to test the correctness of the disassembly is to compare the output with something that we know works. Basically, disassembling any big PowerPC executable by IDA or any other disassemble and comparing the output of tens of millions of instructions is a very good step towards some level of trust that the disassembler is working :)</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">XBox360 specific instructions</h2>
<p dir="auto">Xbox360 has a special version of the PowerPC CPU that has 128 VMX registers (instead of 32 ones in the standard CPU). Those registers are used for vectorized math operations (similarly to SSE). There's no way to address 128 registers in normal PowerPC instructions because there are only 5 bits delegated to indicate the register index in every instruction and this pattern is CPU-wide. Unfortunately, the opcodes for those special instructions are not available on the internet (or are buried deeply). I ended up reversing the opcodes manually by observing the bit patters in the generated listing files. There's a simple tool I've wrote for that <a href="https://github.com/rexdex/recompiler/blob/master/dev/tools/xprint/XOpPrint.cpp">XPrint</a>. Typical output of a decoded instruction bit pattern looks like this:</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Abstract instruction</h2>
<p dir="auto">The result of disassembly process is an "unpacked instruction". The most useful thing is that the opcode and operands are unpacked so an easy "ToString" method can be written for presentation purposes. Surprisingly, this structure captures a lot of quirks of not only the PowerPC instructions but Intel as well. On PowerPC the operand type is closely related to the particular instruction type (add vs addi, etc). On Intel this is not the case and the same instruction (add) may be used with immediate value as well as memory location, etc. To capture this generalization the Operand structure is introduced.</p>

<p dir="auto">In practice, the unpacked format is not good enough for many operations. After the disassembly is completed more work is needed to get the code to a useful state than just unpacking. For example, we need to identify the "blocks" - places in the code where execution enters a particular linear set of instruction that are going to be executed without interruptions until a "jump" or "call" to another block. It's nice and useful to abstract this instruction concept a little bit more. This is done by the following class:</p>

<p dir="auto">By filling in this class the decompiler can express much more about the instruction - i.e. what is it going to do with the control flow of the program or what registers are being read/written by it. Each actual PowerPC instruction has its opcode class that is able to transform the Instruction into the InstructionExtendedInfo.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Blocks</h2>
<p dir="auto">After all instructions are disassembled it's important to identify blocks of instructions that can have known single place of entry. This is done by analyzing all the "call" and "jump" instructions that can be resolved. This is not foolproof as it does not identify properly the indirect calls (vtable, function pointers) and indirect jumps (switch statements). The more knowledge about a block we have and the more certainty about the points of entry the faster code we will be able to generate.</p>

<p dir="auto">There are more optimization steps possible that I'm currently working on - for example if all blocks in a function are "well behaved" - no indirect jumps are found and the function follows ABI rules - clear preamble can be identified + all return statements have proper cleanup code, then we can promote the whole function to a single C++ function pulling all blocks inside + defining all VOLATILE registers inside the function (on stack) and not using the ones in the <em>regs</em> structure.</p>
<p dir="auto">Next optimization step can occur when two "well behaved" functions are calling each other. Then, instead of going through the generic call via the returned "next instruction address" we can generate code like this:</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p>Have you ever noticed that you can’t really “buy” an ebook? Sure, when you click that “Buy Now” button on your ereader, tablet, or phone, it feels like a complete, seamless transaction. But the minute you try to treat your ebook like a physical book – say by sharing it with a friend, selling it to someone else, donating it to a school library, or sometimes even reading it offline, reality sets in. You can’t do any of those things.</p><p>With most ebooks, even if you think you “own” them, the publisher or platform you bought them from will say otherwise. Publishers and platforms insist that you only buy a license to access the books, not the rights to do anything else with them. And because platforms like Amazon and Apple control most of the technology we use to read ebooks, their opinion often dictates the reality of the ebook ecosystem. Beyond controlling books, these platforms can also do several things no physical bookseller has ever had the power to do. They can track your reading habits, stop you from reselling or lending a book, change the book’s content, and delete it from your digital library altogether – even after you’ve bought it. This doesn’t happen in the print book market, where you can still feel confident that when you buy a book, it’s yours to share, sell, or simply read without it being tracked or censored.</p><p>Something happened when we shifted to digital formats that created a loss of rights for readers. Pulling back the curtain on the evolution of ebooks offers some clarity to how the shift to digital left ownership behind in the analog world.</p><p>While most publishers still sell physical books, when it comes to ebooks, the vast majority appear to have made a collective decision to shift to offering only limited licenses. Some of the reasons for this shift are economic, some legal, some technological, and others psychological – a belief that limiting or eliminating digital ownership of books will raise publisher revenues, forstall free copies leaking onto unauthorized websites, and allow publishers and platforms unprecedented control and tracking of the behaviors of readers, as well as universities and libraries that provide ebooks. Whether these beliefs map to reality, however, is hotly contested.</p><blockquote><p>Just as platforms control our tweets, our updates, and the images that we upload, platforms can also control the books we buy, keeping tabs on how, when, and where we use them, and at times, modifying or even deleting their content at will.</p></blockquote><p>Economically, platforms and publishers also believe licensing gives them more control over how ebooks generate revenues. For example, they currently use licensing to charge libraries for the right to lend the book to patrons, or tying ebooks to platforms that monitor user behavior, creating a new revenue stream based on selling user data.</p><p>Legally, the shift from selling to licensing attempts to circumvent centuries of law that have limited publisher control over post-sale uses of books. This law is a copyright doctrine called “exhaustion” or “first sale.” The idea behind first sale is that publishers were always entitled to make money from the first time they sold a book, but after that, the sold copy is beyond their control. The new owner can decide to resell, lend, or use the book in any manner they see fit. Licensing attempts to keep that control with the copyright owner, forever.</p><p>Technologically, publishers have turned to companies like Amazon, Apple, and OverDrive to distribute and control their ebooks. These publisher-platform partnerships presented new opportunities for publishers to remain involved in the post-sale life of a book. Just as platforms control our tweets, our updates, and the images that we upload, platforms can also control the books we buy, keeping tabs on how, when, and where we use them, and at times, modifying or even deleting their content at will. That same control also allows platforms to monitor when and how you read, which is key to new revenue streams based on selling user data.</p><p>Finally, psychologically, publisher-platform partnerships have reinforced a belief long held by publishers that with greater legal and technological control, they will reap greater financial rewards. Publishers believe these rewards flow from forcing purchasers to pay for additional uses (such as when libraries want to lend out ebooks to patrons), and by limiting how books are shared and distributed outside of their control. While it is unclear that any of these beliefs have manifested into reality, the psychology has taken hold, in part because ebook platforms have now locked publishers into this partnership in ways that make it extremely difficult to disentangle.</p><p>This report explains that, while there is nothing new about publishers’ desire to seek novel ways to increase revenues, along with control and surveillance of readers, the new publisher-platform partnership creates a mechanism to align the ebook market with those goals. That new market alignment raises questions about whether these shifts are the best option for readers and institutional book buyers, particularly libraries. It also raises questions about how the newest players in the market – ebook distribution platforms – shape things to align with their own interests.</p><p>In order to fully understand the dynamics at play, we interviewed over 30 stakeholders that fill various essential roles in the ebook marketplace, from publishers to platform CEOs to literary agents, librarians, and lawyers.<sup tabindex="3" id="2DB9ANiNeJKOGIxzrjmXlB"></sup> We discussed the priorities, concerns, and constraints that help shape their participation in the ebook marketplace. Our goal was to understand and document how this world looks through their eyes, and synthesize those views into broader conclusions. In the following sections, we will deconstruct the shifts that have made it difficult to actually own an ebook collection, as well as the challenge that lies ahead if we wish to resurrect ownership as a consumer choice for ebooks.<sup tabindex="3" id="4lGdPO2VYhEgPKbYhdYsxk"></sup></p><p>Our study leads us to several key conclusions:</p><ul><li><p>By turning to platforms as the primary technical means for conveying ebooks, publishers have introduced a third major player into the ebook supply chain: ebook platform companies. Together with publishers, platforms have restricted the ebook market to one composed primarily of licensing instead of sales.</p></li><li><p>The platform companies have motives and goals that are independent of those of publishers or purchasers (including institutional buyers such as libraries and schools). Rather than looking to profit from individual sales, like a bookstore does, platforms compete to collect and control the most aggregate content and consumer data. This enables what are now widely known as “surveillance capitalism” revenue models, from data brokering to personalized ad targeting to the use of content lock-in subscription models.<sup tabindex="3" id="20lJVDR0YulTjg2xABmKUF"></sup> These platforms’ goals are sometimes at odds with the interests of libraries and readers.</p></li><li><p>The introduction of platforms, and especially publisher-platform partnerships, has created new forms of legal and technological lock-in on the publisher side, with dependencies on platform infrastructure posing serious barriers to publishers independently selling ebooks directly to consumers. Platforms have few incentives to support direct sales models that do not require licensing, as those models do not easily support tracking user behavior.</p></li><li><p>The structure of the ebook marketplace has introduced new stressors into both the publishing and library professions. Publishers and libraries feel they are facing existential crises/collapse, and their fears are pushing them into diametrically opposed viewpoints. Publishers feel pressured to protect and paywall their content, while libraries feel pressure to maintain relevant collections that are easily accessible via digital networks. Both libraries and publishers feel dependent on the ebook platform companies to provide the ebooks that readers demand, allowing the platform economy (which is already dominated by only a few large companies) to have even more power over the ebook marketplace.</p></li><li><p>Because of the predominance of the publisher-platform licensing model for the ebook marketplace, important questions exist as to the impact, if any, that digital library lending of books has on that market. For example, while some evidence exists that the availability of second-hand physical books via libraries and used bookstores might compete with direct publisher book sales, it is less clear that the digital loan of a single title by a library competes with platform ebook subscriptions and locked-in book purchases. Moreover, given that publisher-platform partnerships profit from surveillance of book buyers, consumers who choose more privacy-friendly library loans may represent an entirely distinct market that places significant value on data protection.</p></li><li><p>While access to user data generated by platform surveillance of readers is a potential benefit to publishers, in practice publishers do not fully exploit (and may not have full access to) that information.</p></li></ul><h2 id="the-emergence-of-the-publisher-platform-partnership">The Emergence of the Publisher-Platform Partnership</h2><p>Before getting into the details of how the ebook marketplace has evolved, it is worth considering the major market players and how they relate to one another.<sup tabindex="3" id="zvGYWDwrpXbA9ufmX4wkV"></sup> This is key to understanding why the publisher-platform partnership has been so effective in structuring the ebook market in a way that is different from the physical book market.</p><h3 id="the-physical-book-market">The Physical Book Market</h3><p>One simplified way to imagine the physical book market is as having two poles. One pole is publishers. The other is purchasers.</p><div><p>Figure 1. The physical book market.</p><p><img id="6GOlP27STGmELVu5PZIvgE" src="https://images.ctfassets.net/7yhm3nqs96oa/78HEbBa9RuszDMhDlwfx0V/e302e837e151c32f6fa3e58ad9190940/fig-1.png" alt="A graphic illustrating a spectrum with two poles, 'Publishers' and 'Purchasers'."></p><p>One simplified way to imagine the physical book market is as having two poles. One pole is publishers. The other is purchasers.</p></div><p>The publishers work with authors to bring individual titles to market. It is the role of the publishers to manage the economic life of the book. Most authors hand over control of the economic life of the book – marketing, design, manufacturing, distribution – to the publishers.</p><p>The purchasers take a book out of the publisher’s control and into the world. The purchaser may be an institutional purchaser, like a library, or an individual reader who wants to own the book themselves. The purchaser may also provide others access to the books, such as public school students or library patrons. Whatever form they take, once the purchaser has purchased the book, the book leaves the control of the publisher and becomes the property of the purchaser.</p><p>Of course, bookstores (and equivalent intermediaries in the institutional context) are also an important part of this equation. They serve as a bridge between publishers and purchasers. Bookstores order books from publishers, market them to purchasers, and ultimately deliver them into the hands of purchasers.</p><div><p>Figure 2. Bookstores serve as a bridge between publishers and purchasers.</p><p><img id="6mqa9Yfn8Fd8AUoHB9h8kf" src="https://images.ctfassets.net/7yhm3nqs96oa/1YP8XH4xS7QQ681L5oxbPw/fff65e6e67107d9079fbcb2bc3604d17/fig-2.png" alt="A graphic illustrating the spectrum from Figure 1 with two poles, 'Publishers' and 'Purchasers', but adding 'Bookstores' as a bridge between the two poles."></p><p>Bookstores order books from publishers, market them to purchasers, and ultimately deliver them into the hands of purchasers.</p></div><p>However, bookstores have only a transitory moment of control over the books. When they order books, they either sell them to purchasers or return them to publishers. The bookstores have no direct control over how publishers decide to create individual titles, nor do they have the ability to control how purchasers use the books, once they are purchased. In fact, all of the flows in the physical book market are essentially one way – from publishers, to bookstores, to purchasers.</p><h3 id="the-ebook-market-and-the-publisher-platform-partnership">The Ebook Market and the Publisher-Platform Partnership</h3><p>The ebook market is different in some key ways. One important difference is that the flows in the ebook market do not move in just one direction. Swapping ebook platforms for bookstores creates a long-term connection among everyone involved in the transaction. Unlike distributors and bookstores, ebook platforms have an ongoing relationship with ebooks that extends well beyond the point of purchase. Not only do ebook platforms market and sell the books – they are where purchasers go to manage and read them. This ongoing relationship with the ebook is fundamentally different from the temporary transactional nature bookstores play in the physical book market.

These nodes are in constant dialogue with each other, well past the point of purchase.</p></div><p>By maintaining contact with the ebook and the purchaser in perpetuity, platforms have the opportunity to generate new types of data about purchasers and their habits. Publishers and platforms team up to exercise levels of control over purchasers and copies of ebooks in ways that are impossible in the physical book market.</p><p>Like all partnerships, the publisher-platform partnership encompasses distinct incentives that are often – but not always – aligned.<sup tabindex="3" id="6spWjgzXzXYDOxuHlGkoyz"></sup> When publishers and platforms coordinate, they can shape the market in their favor by limiting traditional rights of purchasers.</p><p>Publishers and platforms share incentives to increase control over how ebooks are used, especially at the expense of the purchasers. Both can also benefit from accessing reader data, although, as discussed in more detail below, the nature of the benefits differs somewhat. Publishers and platforms also have an interest in preventing purchaser behavior that they disapprove of. Sometimes, that behavior is illegal behavior, such as large-scale pirating of ebooks. Other times, that behavior is simply behavior that the publishers and platforms see as contrary to their own interests, such as lending an ebook to a friend.</p><p>There are also times when the publishers’ and platforms’ interests do not align. Platforms have clear incentives to lock purchasers into their platform, and monetizing user data is core to their business models. Publishers have incentives to sell more books, which could potentially benefit from a diversity of platforms competing with each other for different types of purchasers. Publishers may also be less effective than platforms at fully exploiting user data, and less interested in doing so.</p><p>While these differences are important, the aligned interests of the publisher-platform partnership have been powerful enough to create an ebook market that is very different from the physical book market. This paper focuses on a number of dynamics that flow from the partnership, and changes that those dynamics create.</p><h2 id="from-physical-book-sales-to-ebook-licensing-an-opportunity-for-publishers-to-achieve-long-held-goals">From Physical Book Sales to Ebook Licensing – An Opportunity for Publishers to Achieve Long-Held Goals</h2><p>The markets for ebooks and physical books are very different. Some of those differences are obvious – physical books are easy to measure and identify as individual objects, while ebooks are more fluid and ephemeral as data that can be stored, transmitted, and accessed in myriad ways. Other differences emerge only when readers attempt to treat ebooks like physical books, and in doing so run into legal and technological restrictions.</p><p>As we will explain below, physical books are governed by rules of property and ownership that can be traced back centuries. These rules give people who own physical books clear rights over how they can use those books. However, the rules that govern ebooks are much less clear.</p><h3 id="from-owning-to-purchasing-with-licenses-and-tracking">From Owning to ‘Purchasing’ (With Licenses and Tracking)</h3><p>For centuries, the law has always balanced the right of an author or publisher to control their intellectual property with the right of a book purchaser to control the copy they buy. Every sale of a physical book involves an exchange. Purchasers pay money to the publisher. In return, publishers give up their ownership over that copy of the book being sold. The purchaser owns their copy of the book and can treat it as their private property, not worrying what the publisher might want.</p><p>Over the years, publishers have made many attempts to avoid this exchange, controlling both the purchase price and what purchasers do with the books after they are sold. For example, in the early 1900s, publishers tried to control resale prices on the books people bought from retailers by stamping mandatory resale prices on a book’s front page.<sup tabindex="3" id="1c2hgE9w9tQXD6pTuwcVQ3"></sup> (That attempt was rejected by the US Supreme Court).<sup tabindex="3" id="Qdtm4hR65hIuXea02Y8Fs"></sup> Publishers also tried to limit where people could resell books they bought, in one case claiming that a book sold in Thailand couldn’t be resold in the US.<sup tabindex="3" id="7xbMzSd6WDeztyUyYg47oX"></sup> (That attempt was also rejected by the US Supreme Court, in 2013).<sup tabindex="3" id="fR4UAMQcRvuyXuZQdwX6o"></sup> These attempts failed because the publisher’s copyright does not give them absolute control of a book in perpetuity; the copyright system is a balance between publishers and purchasers.<sup tabindex="3" id="2PZ7hxi50VmyCXGtHco4vG"></sup> If publishers want the benefits of the copyright system, they also have to accept the limits it imposes on their power.</p><p>Publishers do not get to tell purchasers what they can do with physical books, because of a longstanding principle in copyright law called “exhaustion,” also known as “the First Sale Doctrine.”<sup tabindex="3" id="2MDHbtEFeQOMWnrBpsQ7mr"></sup> This rule says that as soon as a copyright holder parts with a copy of their work – whether through a sale, a donation, or even by throwing copies in a trash bin – they no longer have any claim of control over that copy. Instead, whomever comes into lawful possession of that copy now has all of the “incidents of ownership” that come with any other form of personal property. This rule is not limited to physical objects that are protected by copyright. It protects anyone who purchases any sort of physical object. In the same way that a car company cannot shut down independent used car lots and toaster companies cannot police the prices of used toasters at thrift stores, publishers cannot claim control over the copies of books we lawfully own.</p><blockquote><p>Copyright law provides incentives for publishers to help produce books, periodicals, and magazines. It also supports institutions such as libraries and archives that work to preserve those works after they are sold and ensure long-lasting access.</p></blockquote><p>This rule exists for many reasons – respect for personal property, market efficiency, privacy, and preservation chief among them. Copyright law provides incentives for publishers to help produce books, periodicals, and magazines. It also supports institutions such as libraries and archives that work to preserve those works after they are sold and ensure long-lasting access. For physical books, all of this happens seamlessly every day because of the First Sale Doctrine.</p><p>The advent of digital books has reinvigorated this long-running battle over post-exchange uses, with publishers claiming that they have the right to charge money for an ebook and decide what happens to that digital copy after money has changed hands.<sup tabindex="3" id="7krG0C9Eat6ArdKa0LOIDN"></sup></p><h3 id="publishers-belief-that-secondary-markets-and-library-lending-undermine-profits">Publishers’ Belief That Secondary Markets and Library Lending Undermine Profits</h3><p>For decades, publishers have expressed displeasure over the ways the First Sale Doctrine has prevented them from exercising control over books once they were sold to customers. These critiques often target the secondary market, where used books are sold at prices, times, and places beyond publishers’ control by sellers with no obligations to report those sales back to the original publishers. After several failed attempts to challenge the First Sale Doctrine in the context of the physical book market, many of the publishers’ concerns seem now to be manifesting within the rules of ebook distribution platforms and licenses.<sup tabindex="3" id="2YYlZG4b9Usdro4BJRUmJ7"></sup></p><p>Economic studies paint a complex picture of the interplay among used book markets, new book sales, publisher profits, and overall consumer welfare for physical books.<sup tabindex="3" id="5LjgEpfSdz4IMncO2z6BUG"></sup> In some cases, the used book market may increase publisher profits because people are willing to pay a higher price for a new book they know they can sell later. In other cases, a lower-priced used copy of a book could steer a purchaser away from paying full price for a new copy. However, even in the case of consumer preferences for cheaper used copies, or borrowing books from libraries instead of purchasing them, it is unclear how often used book purchases or library loans are actual substitutes for new-book buying. Participants who work with libraries at Big Five publishing houses did recognize that libraries are sites of discovery that lead to book sales. There are also other social benefits of secondary markets, such as privacy and preservation, that can impact the analysis.</p><blockquote><p>Regardless of the actual impact that a robust secondary market may have on an individual publisher’s sales and profits, for well over a century publishers have demonstrated that they believe the secondary market acts to undercut prices, sales, and profits in the primary book market.</p></blockquote><p>Regardless of the actual impact that a robust secondary market may have on an individual publisher’s sales and profits, for well over a century publishers have demonstrated that they believe the secondary market acts to undercut prices, sales, and profits in the primary book market. This belief that the secondary market is harming their business has driven publishers’ behavior since at least the start of the 20th century. That publisher wariness of the uncontrolled use of books is key to understanding publisher motivations as the ebook market has evolved.</p><p>Bobbs-Merrill Company v. Straus, the 1908 Supreme Court case that established the First Sale Doctrine in United States common law, flowed directly from a publisher’s attempt to control the minimum price that the novel The Castaway could be sold for on the secondary market.<sup tabindex="3" id="7t3qetQJIPQI3jdRI3XFMI"></sup> In that case, The Castaway’s publisher, the Bobbs-Merrill Company, added a notice to each copy of the book that no dealer was “authorized” to sell the book for less than $1. When the Straus brothers purchased a number of copies and decided to sell them for less than $1, Bobbs-Merrill sued to enforce its $1 price floor. Ultimately, the US Supreme Court ruled that Straus did not need “authorization” from Bobbs-Merrill (or anyone else) to sell the books at whatever price they chose. Once Bobbs-Merrill sold the books, their preferences for how the books were used did not matter.</p><p>This hostility toward the secondary market continued even after the Bobb-Merrill decision tamped down publishers’ legal power to limit it. In 1931, a group of book publishers hired PR pioneer Edward Bernays – the “father of spin” – to fight against used “dollar books” and the general practice of book lending. Bernays decided to run a contest to “look for a pejorative word for the book borrower, the wretch who raised hell with book sales and deprived authors of earned royalties.” The contest generated an impressive list of verbal assaults on those who would dare to lend or receive a book without paying for the privilege to do so. Suggested names included “book weevil,” “bookbum,” “culture vulture,” “book-bummer,” and “book buzzard.”<sup tabindex="3" id="6QseBo4rIORVNcno54jSYs"></sup></p><div><p>Figure 4.

E. Ferguson’s 1969 revised-edition economics textbook, he genially declared that “[s]ince everyone knows the basic reason for a revised edition is to kill off the existing used book market, it would be idle to suggest otherwise.”<sup tabindex="3" id="3AJG6tMH2dtfVeMZqyK40q"></sup> Similarly, in 1974, it was reported that “[p]ublisher’s representatives have no doubt” second-hand copies of textbooks acted as “a drain on publishers’ and authors’ profits.”<sup tabindex="3" id="3FYsONgiNNSIMVeXjG3W9p"></sup></p><p>Publishers demonstrated their antipathy toward the secondary market again when Amazon launched its secondary book market. In 2002, Association of American Publishers (AAP) President Patricia Schroeder told The New York Times: “I wring my hands, pound my desk and say, ‘Aargh,’” because publishers could not legally prevent Amazon from immediately offering used books for sale (at a price outside of the publishers’ control), once those books entered the market.<sup tabindex="3" id="61RrrcdhyxSwewnjGZ5kQG"></sup> Schroeder pleads for more control over the secondary market: “‘We asked could we at least talk about when something could become available as a used book? Could we maybe wait three months after the book was published?”</p><p>Amazon founder Jeff Bezos responded to the complaints by reminding publishers about the First Sale Doctrine: “When someone buys a book, they are also buying the right to resell that book, to loan it out, or to even give it away if they want. Everyone understands this.”<sup tabindex="3" id="3IhMkqhmu0I5NVoUAWH4b0"></sup> In short, Bezos said tough luck – ownership confers certain rights, including the right to resell.<sup tabindex="3" id="1LC092NTJpWSj8VDsJhKPZ"></sup></p><p>Having no luck in judicial courts or the courts of public opinion when it came to controlling the secondary market for physical books, publishers saw a new opportunity as they began to offer ebooks to the public. They saw ebook licenses – not sales – as a way to retain control over digital books by preventing secondary markets from developing. Platforms like Amazon, and other secondhand booksellers, cannot resell ebooks they or their users do not own. Borrowing from the software industry’s playbook, publishers adopted the practice of licensing content from ebooks instead of selling ebooks outright. By licensing ebooks, publishers could claim they avoid transferring digital ownership, which would create first sale rights for purchasers. A research study participant formerly at a Big Five publishing house explained the practical effect of this approach: “With a license, you can’t give it away. You can’t sell it. You can use it. And you can see why you have to do that. Right? Because if we sold you the digital file, you could resell it to whoever you want at whatever price you wanted. And there’s no limit.”</p><p>Although concerns about the secondary market usually are discussed in the context of used book sales, participants in the publishing industry also expressed wariness about book owners lending their books to friends. As a former executive at a major publishing house noted, one benefit of a license was that once you pay for an ebook, “you can’t give it away.”</p><p>Decades of publisher hostility does not prove that the secondary market actively harms the interests of publishers or authors. While there are publishing employees who do not seem to believe the resale of books is an ongoing concern to publishers, because they are resold through bookstores and similar venues, there is still evidence of a pervasive belief within the publishing industry that the ability of book purchasers to resell their books outside of publisher control is a problem that needs to be addressed. This belief may help explain the publishing industry’s enthusiasm for digital distribution models that eliminate first sale and the independent secondary market entirely.</p><h3 id="fear-loathing-and-imitation-of-the-music-industry-s-digital-marketplace">Fear, Loathing, and Imitation of the Music Industry’s Digital Marketplace</h3><p>The vendors and publishing workers interviewed for this study consistently cited the history of the music industry’s trials, tribulations, and ultimate transition to digital as a cautionary tale that helps explain why publishers adamantly prefer to structure all ebook purchases as licenses instead of sales. Publishers and booksellers saw music industry empires crumble in the early 2000s as open digital music formats such as MP3 became popular. Companies like Sam Goody and Tower Records shuttered their physical storefronts as people started downloading music from unauthorized sources like Napster, Kazaa, Aimster, Grokster, and LimeWire instead of buying physical copies.</p><p>For most study participants, the music industry acted as a powerful negative example of what could happen during a digital transition. It was cited by the publishers as a foundation of the current ebook market in proceedings against the Internet Archive’s Controlled Digital Lending service. “Mindful of the havoc wrought on the music industry by piracy and the uncontrolled appropriation of digital content, the Publishers developed a sustainable market for affordable ebooks with critical controls, including limiting commercial ebooks to one user account.”<sup tabindex="3" id="682dNKITriu1elj3V9GhrM"></sup></p><p>Later, a senior vice president of a Hachette imprint reiterated these concerns in the same proceeding. “Many authors (and some publishers) were initially wary of entering the ebook market, in large part because it emerged in the wake of the destruction that websites like Napster caused to the music industry.”<sup tabindex="3" id="2Z8NYKWsEzkMj8lKj5FQhq"></sup></p><p>Chantal Restivo-Alessi, the chief digital officer of HarperCollins, serves as a personal bridge between the two industries. “The ebook was developed in the shadow of rampant piracy in the music industry in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Concerns about the widespread unauthorized distribution of digital copies were front of mind when the company first began to evaluate the ebook format decades ago and have remained in the forefront of my thoughts once I joined the company in 2012. I know this history first-hand because I worked in the record industry from 1996 to 2007.”<sup tabindex="3" id="2KGjB0dGQaslq1nYC7uxWM"></sup></p><p>While it is not entirely clear how this history has influenced individual decision-making, its pervasiveness in discussions around ebooks is noteworthy in and of itself. “Books are a thin-margin business,” a former executive at a Big Five publisher said. “So if you have a drop of say, 15% of people who go into bookstores, they will not be able to make it through. And so you would have what happened to music stores happen to bookstores, and nobody in publishing wants to see that.”</p><p>One study participant, who is an executive with a book trade association, believes publishers misinterpreted how the music industry was ravaged by these changes.</p><blockquote><p>“There’s some aspects of what happened with music that applies to journal publishing and there are some types of books that might emulate what’s happening to journal publishing, but I think overall, what happened with music was that people didn’t want the bundle. They didn’t want the album. Most people, they wanted a song, or they wanted a couple of songs. And there was no market to create those songs until Napster came along. And Napster did it in a way that violated copyright and got it shut down but it opened the barn door to oh, we can sell songs and Apple stepped in, particularly among other [technology companies], and said, ‘Alright, we can help you, the label, sell more songs.’”</p></blockquote><p>In the early 2000s, Amazon experimented with the idea of selling a few pages of a book digitally. As Jim Zarroli reported for NPR in 2005, there didn’t appear to be much of a market for this service and it didn’t take long for Amazon to discontinue this service.<sup tabindex="3" id="7yZmSVKq9OlZ1hqWyRFBcz"></sup></p><p>“People don’t buy chapters,” the same participant added. “They do in education, but not in trade. It’s not to say that there isn’t some Napsterization of aspects of book publishing; I think for retail it’s not really relevant.”</p><p>Nonetheless, what happened with music and other entertainment formats was enough to have publishers concerned. As one executive with an ebook platform company recalled, in the early 2010s, publishers were extremely worried about the entire industry’s ability to be turned upside down by piracy.</p><blockquote><p>“In 2021, 2022, 2023, they’re looking at it more from the point of view of subscription and streaming models and the change to economics that happens when you move from selling things one at a time to selling things through subscription services. So they seem to spend a lot of time thinking about the music industry.”</p></blockquote><p>The focus on unauthorized file-sharing systems like Napster as a threat to ebook publishers overshadows the eventually successful, legitimate market for digital music. Today, music labels can distribute copies of music on platforms like Apple’s iTunes and Amazon’s MP3 Store and independent music sites like Bandcamp. These sites all sell music files to consumers, yet the publishing industry appears to have ignored these models in favor of more platform-based licensing approaches such as Spotify. While the experience of individual artists has varied significantly, the fact that the music industry has managed to stay afloat despite the loss of physical storefronts and albums, benefitting from new platform streaming models that depend on user subscriptions, digital ads, and data collection, has had an impact on the publishing mentality.<sup tabindex="3" id="5sOaYes191ZnjqKEValesZ"></sup></p><p>“Music went through some bumps, but now I would say the music industry is in a pretty great state, right?” an executive at an ebook subscription service platform said. “Between Spotify and Apple Music, there’s still a lot of subscription revenue out there for music. So I think there may be some bumps in the road in embracing the escription model, but I think that in the long run it’s going to be much better for the [publishing] industry for everyone to just embrace it.”</p><p>In some ways, fears that are discussed in the context of the music industry may really be anxiety about change more broadly. Multiple study participants that maintain professional relationships with major publishers recall publishers’ long-term reluctance to embrace the ebook format simply because it was outside their comfort zone.</p><h3 id="publishers-interpret-changes-in-copyright-law-as-an-opportunity-to-shut-down-secondary-markets">Publishers Interpret Changes in Copyright Law As An Opportunity to Shut Down Secondary Markets</h3><p>Courts have not settled on how to treat digital ownership, and publishers are taking advantage of this unresolved legal issue. The advent of digital technology has complicated and obfuscated the distinction between sales and licenses for digital goods.<sup tabindex="3" id="58Vjpmcw8E5n3RIIzg6ogk"></sup> One reason that copyright is so complicated online is the way digital goods are copied. When physical books are copied, it is easy to quantify and track those copies. Each copy can be counted, lifted, stacked, and stored on a tangible shelf. Digital copies are much harder to quantify and track.<sup tabindex="3" id="bMfumoE1jIG86ijrATfdC"></sup> With digital technology, there is rarely, if ever, a single copy of a work, even when the work is sold. Copies bought on CD or DVD are then loaded into the memory of a laptop computer. Downloads purchased via the cloud end up stored locally on a phone or tablet and across numerous cloud servers.</p><blockquote><p>This rhetorical shift from ‘selling’ individual copies on digital media to ‘licensing’ a collection of multiple copies for use in digital memory began to obfuscate who controlled the digital item that was sold to the consumer.</p></blockquote><p>Digital copies, even those purchased lawfully, often required a temporary instance of the software to be loaded into digital memory. As a result, copyright owners began to claim that a copyright license for these additional copies was needed to cover the copies of the work that existed in computer memory.<sup tabindex="3" id="CGOCeiF6XxOYfqGaVU7sM"></sup> This rhetorical shift from “selling” individual copies on digital media to “licensing” a collection of multiple copies for use in digital memory began to obfuscate who controlled the digital item that was sold to the consumer.</p><p>Even the notion of a “copy” soon became more metaphysical than physical in the world of digital content. The existence of a single “copy” became illusory, especially as modern computer storage systems learned to fragment even single files into thousands or millions of “shards” so they could be stored efficiently across various memory locations. Those same systems can make multitudes of ephemeral copies of files in the process of achieving mundane tasks like displaying the page of an ebook on a screen. Even if a consumer could argue that they owned the “copy” they bought, the tough question soon became: Where exactly is this copy? And how does the consumer find it if they want to resell it, lend it, or even give it away to a friend or family member?</p><h3 id="courts-begin-to-weigh-in">Courts Begin to Weigh In</h3><p>US courts struggled with how to think about the notion of a digital copy, and how to distinguish between a digital sale and a digital license. While some early courts were able to draw a distinction by analyzing a CD or DVD sale as controlled by copyright law and the installation of the digital content on a computer governed by whether a separate “contract” existed between the seller and the buyer, later courts could not make such clear-cut distinctions between copyright, which is governed by the First Sale Doctrine, and contract law-bound ownership arrangements, which are not.<sup tabindex="3" id="1uFAyHE8q3XvuAGVjv6hdG"></sup></p><p>In the summer of 2010, the US Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals heard three different copyright appeals, all of which turned on the notion of whether or not a consumer who had purchased or been gifted a digital copy could make independent uses of that copy against the wishes of the copyright owner. The first case was <i>UMG Recordings, Inc. v. Augusto</i>.<sup tabindex="3" id="UsKUWVAiXDee2KtwhdOt8"></sup> The major record label UMG had a practice of sending unsolicited promotional (“promo”) CDs to DJs and other music fans. Troy Augusto, an entrepreneurial CD collector, would lawfully purchase used promo CDs and resell them, even though they often had a label on them stating “Not for Resale.” The second case was <i>Vernor v. Autodesk</i>, a similar case in which Tim Vernor bought and resold used copies of Autodesk’s architectural software program, AutoCad.<sup tabindex="3" id="1QozKvR57TqRWRKIadhKaa"></sup> Finally, in <i>MDY v. Blizzard</i>, the court heard a case as to whether purchasers of Blizzard’s World of Warcraft (WoW) video game infringed its copyright when they used a third-party “bot” program to autopilot their videogame characters through menial tasks in the game, a practice which Blizzard had forbidden in its game rules.<sup tabindex="3" id="2sEA7d6eJLclsIgZQszcc5"></sup></p><p>In each of these cases, questions of digital ownership were central. Despite the similarities among the fact patterns, the same three judges decided all three cases differently. Augusto emerged victorious, the court deciding that the lawful recipient owners of the promo CDs had a legal right to give their CDs to anyone and, thus, he had a legal right to resell them as he pleased. Vernor, on the other hand, was out of luck. The court decided that the Autodesk license was somehow stronger than the “Not for Resale” label on the CDs, and that digital software, oddly, was in some way inherently different from digital music, without saying exactly how. And in <i>MDY</i>, the court went a third way, saying that depending on the license term and language, the consumer sometimes had a right to use the software as she liked, and other times, she didn’t. It appeared that the terms copyright holders attached to digital media were important, although it remained unclear exactly how the power of terms interacted with the rights of users.</p><p>Then, in 2018, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals gave its own gloss on digital ownership. In <i>Capitol Records v. ReDigi</i>, the court considered whether a consumer who “bought” digital music songs from Apple’s iTunes Store had a right to resell them, and relatedly, whether the online marketplace ReDigi could help facilitate such sales.<sup tabindex="3" id="3qPqpqsS5zY2lmfztH2Tac"></sup> Here, the battle over rhetoric, technology, and copyright law reached a fever pitch. On the one hand, ReDigi had engineered a system that ensured the transfer of a music file securely from the seller’s computer to the purchaser’s without any extra copies being made. On the other hand, because the transfer was done through ReDigi’s cloud-based service, the transfer process involved making multiple intermediary copies of the original file, including the final copy on the purchaser’s computer. In deciding the case, the court interpreted this second digital location as a “copy” of the file, instead of a relocation of the original file from one computer to the other. And as such, that made the buyer’s copy an infringing reproduction of the song instead of a resale of the buyer’s copy.</p><p>All of this conflicting case law left quite a state of confusion for what it means to “own” digital goods. To some degree, that is still the case. The Supreme Court, to its credit, has tried to clarify in both a copyright case involving internationally sold used books and a patent case involving the reselling of printer toner cartridges that the First Sale Doctrine means just that – copyright and patent owners get to set the terms only the first time they sell a copy that contains their work.<sup tabindex="3" id="5KfLwIkGfYmGTushxvv4g8"></sup> But, because neither case was entirely digital in nature, the conflict and confusion between the Supreme Court’s approach and cases like ReDigi, MDY, Vernor, and Augusto remains.<sup tabindex="3" id="5qu03W33IWLkp7Rg6ACaTW"></sup></p><p>The vast majority of publishers have since taken advantage of this confusion, and have begun to insist that approaches like Vernor, which maximize the control that license terms can have on users, represent the current state of the law.<sup tabindex="3" id="1GjTKHfhzNhbmevQUg0Djc"></sup> What the US courts or Congress will ultimately decide on these issues and how that will impact digital ownership of ebooks remains to be seen. In the meantime, publishers continue to move forward on building a walled garden for ebooks built on licenses and technological limitations for consumers and cultural institutions.</p><h3 id="digital-distribution-changes-the-economics-of-book-production">Digital Distribution Changes the Economics of Book Production</h3><p>Another murky area of the ebooks analysis is what it costs to publish an ebook. Is it more expensive to publish paper or electronic copies of books? Publishers sometimes claim that it is expensive to publish an ebook, but concrete numbers about how much ebooks cost to produce are hard, if not impossible, to find. Although reliable empirical data is limited, ebooks appear to be relatively inexpensive to produce when compared to physical books. One participant from a Big Five publisher stated simply that “Ebooks are easy to create in a form that everyone accepts as acceptable.” What that means, according to one digital sales representative at a Big Five publisher, is that the people who work on ebook files have to “design the file in such a way that it recognizes what device it’s being rendered on. We make sure that [the file] can be rendered on that device.”</p><p>This individual went on to explain that when file formats are not fully compatible across devices, text can display with unwanted spaces and characters that take away from the user’s experience. “When a book is designed, believe it or not, it’s like a work of art. We actually have book designers who actually design how fonts look on a page.”</p><blockquote><p>A lot of our effort in print is dedicated toward optimizing that in terms of, you know, the paper that we acquire, the printing, space, transportation, shipping. None of that is required for ebooks.</p></blockquote><p>A participant from a trade publishing association had a more nuanced view that comes across as more critical of the process: “Generally people see digital books as more expensive, but I would argue that they are not in terms of prep work, and that when it’s more expensive it’s because your workflow wasn’t built to support multiple outputs…. I’m keenly aware of what happens with digital formats when you first start trying to do them. You create a separate workflow with separate processes, you make more mistakes, things don’t work out, and then they kind of become calcified.”</p><p>According to an independent publisher, “If it’s a book with text, it just means creating a flowable epub file, which is not hard. If it is an illustrated book, then a fixed format epub is usually created, unless the publisher wants to pay extra for fancy features and custom coding.” Flowable epub files work across platforms because they are responsive and the text works and “reflows” in whatever device it’s being used on.<sup tabindex="3" id="2KodjMstv8sQpaHHayRcOx"></sup></p><p>The relative economy of ebooks may also flow from the fact that ebook files are created once at the time of initial publication and then distributed in response to demand. One Big Five publishing house employee noted the inefficiencies inherent in the physical book distribution model when compared to ebooks: “A lot of our effort in print is dedicated toward optimizing that in terms of, you know, the paper that we acquire, the printing, space, transportation, shipping. None of that is required for ebooks.”</p><p>The economy of ebooks can also make hits especially profitable when, as a study participant from a trade association confirmed regarding ebooks, “the marginal cost is closer to zero.” A former Big Five executive also seemed to confirm this thought: “In an ebook, there’s no variable cost at all once you set up the system, right? You can put one book through, 100 books through, 50,000 books through. No additional cost, you’re just transferring files.”</p><p>Even if a book is a bust, there are still cost savings when publishers are dealing with the ebook format. In ebook publishing, there are no unsold copies. Publishing industry norms allow bookstores to return any unsold copies of a book to the publisher. In those cases, the publisher has paid to create the book, ship the book to the bookseller, return the book to the publishers, and destroy the copy. These costs do not exist when ebooks are distributed on demand.</p><h2 id="ebooks-reduce-the-friction-in-library-lending-raising-concerns-for-publishers">Ebooks Reduce the Friction in Library Lending, Raising Concerns for Publishers</h2><p>In addition to music industry-related fears, publishers are afraid that libraries lending ebooks will undermine the publishing business in a way that paper book lending doesn’t. Although some argue that ebook licensing helped increase access to broad digital collections during the COVID pandemic, ebooks and ebook licensing also limit the content and distribution of libraries’ collections.</p><p>In addition to visiting libraries to pick out paper books to take home, library patrons also use their library cards to access ebooks through websites that are made by third-party vendors and accessible on library websites. Instead of owning or controlling books, libraries sign digital library “access agreements” with companies like Hoopla, which select which ebooks library patrons can access and decide the terms of that access and lending for the libraries.<sup tabindex="3" id="X2SzzYATpNzUkOTdI0CtO"></sup> These types of arrangements with ebook platforms worry library workers, who feel their roles are being replaced by the new vendors, or eliminated entirely. Other ebook platforms like OverDrive do let librarians handle decisions around collection development for ebooks because libraries can pick and choose individual titles. However, the same cost and restrictions still apply to librarians that use OverDrive.</p><h3 id="publishers-worry-that-patron-lending-may-undermine-sales">Publishers Worry That Patron Lending May Undermine Sales</h3><p>Publishers worry that one-click access through libraries will discourage readers from purchasing books. One participant from a Big Five publisher in digital explained, “What is the difference between, you know, say, there’s a new book coming out, and a customer has a choice to buy it on Amazon or log on at home and download it from their library for free? There’s much more incentive to download it for free and if there’s no limit to whether that book is available…. we don’t want everyone who wants to read [the] book knowing that they can get it through the library the same day and date of the release and they don’t sell anything at all.”</p><p>Publishers made a similar point in their lawsuit against the Internet Archive’s Controlled Digital Lending program. “The convenience of library ebook lending – particularly the ability to check out ebooks instantaneously, anytime and anywhere – makes it a highly attractive proposition to consumers who might otherwise purchase ebooks.”<sup tabindex="3" id="5oKAXkxc91zraVEgXpAcXh"></sup></p><p>This concern is often described as a lack of “friction” compared to physical book lending. It is rooted in the view that the ease of accessing books on ebook platforms like OverDrive’s Libby is now roughly equal to the ease of purchasing those same ebooks.</p><blockquote><p>For the consumer, borrowing a free ebook from a library’s website, on the one hand, or obtaining it from Amazon or other e-retailers, on the other hand, are extremely similar experiences, except that one is free and one is not.</p></blockquote><p>Participants associated with the publishing industry often drew a contrast between the similarity of the ebook purchasing and lending experiences on one hand, and the differences between the physical book purchasing and lending experiences on the other. However, those comparisons often exclusively attributed burdens to lending physical books that exist for purchasing physical books as well. For example, travel time and the possibility of a book not being available was often cited as a point of friction in library lending, while being essentially ignored for bookstore purchases.</p><p>A former executive at a Big Five publishing house used this framework to describe the friction involved with lending physical books: “If I’m a consumer in the old days, I could buy a book in the bookstore and read it. Or I could get in the car, drive down to the library instead of the bookstore, look to see if they had it. Check it out. If I hadn’t finished it in two weeks, I was going to have to bring it back. I was gonna forget to bring it back. I was gonna have to pay a fine. Oh, my kid lost it. Where the hell did that book go? Now I’m gonna get charged for the goddamn book and I don’t even have it.” While the post-check-out friction is specific to libraries, everything up to that point would also apply to the bookstore experience.</p><p>This concern was echoed by the senior VP of Grand Central Publishing (an imprint of Hachette) in the Internet Archive Controlled Digital Lending litigation. “We believe that the ‘friction’ involved in checking out physical books from libraries – the delays when a popular book is not available, the time and costs associated with traveling to the library to check out a physical book – may motivate some library patrons to purchase their own copy rather than check the book out from the library.”<sup tabindex="3" id="20h5i3xiZVVhUD70DR0DGM"></sup></p><p>While participants from the publishing industry often drew sharp contrasts between the lending and purchasing experience of physical books, they highlighted the similarity between lending and purchasing ebooks. The same executive continued: “Perhaps most importantly, the convenience of ebook lending – particularly the ability of users to check ebooks out instantaneously anytime and anywhere – makes it a highly attractive proposition to consumers who would otherwise purchase books instead of going to the library. Critically, the experience of checking out a library ebook is functionally identical to downloading a copy from Amazon.”<sup tabindex="3" id="5zYrriZsPe9AHjS7cRM317"></sup></p><p>The chief digital officer at HarperCollins drew the same connection. “For the consumer, borrowing a free ebook from a library’s website, on the one hand, or obtaining it from Amazon or other e-retailers, on the other hand, are extremely similar experiences, except that one is free and one is not.”<sup tabindex="3" id="2YpILzCnx0apDyH4wgswqu"></sup></p><p>A senior VP at Wiley expanded: “An ebook would be capable of far more efficient reproduction and distribution than a print book, allowing it to serve exponentially greater demand.”<sup tabindex="3" id="4YIq12OkVXepdXDxZI4aCZ"></sup></p><p>Publishers are also concerned that library lending of ebooks will “train” readers that the value of ebooks is zero. This fear of training in the ebook market appears to be more acute than in the physical book market because of the publisher perception that ebook lending and purchasing is more similar than physical book lending and purchasing. The same former publishing executive explained: “And then the final significant danger is the deterioration in value. And that comes primarily through library lending. Right? The library lending issue is very difficult because it educates a whole group of people that books are essentially free.”</p><p>This concern about “free” books is echoed in the publishers’ complaint against the Internet Archive’s Controlled Digital Lending system: “[B]y providing copies of digital books for free, [the Internet Archive] devalues the book market. Consumers begin to view works as cheap and become increasingly unappreciative of what it takes to produce them and unwilling to pay fair value for them.”<sup tabindex="3" id="1TFjLvcnq1g6fUdGT8XwuG"></sup> This concern is not unprecedented – music platforms have been similarly critiqued for devaluing the artists’ and labels’ labor.<sup tabindex="3" id="1ZJHBBcOZ6UwPwkjwqgKxe"></sup></p><p>The former publishing executive worries that nobody will buy ebooks if they can get an identical copy for free from a library. “And that lowers the amount of cash that comes into the system, which lowers the author’s advances, which makes it more difficult to be a publisher, and eventually makes it very difficult to make a living writing books.”</p><p>In conversations with participants, it was not always clear why publishers tend to view library copies of ebooks as “free.” Although these copies are free to patrons, they are available to patrons because libraries have purchased them from publishers. Increased patron demand for individual titles would encourage libraries to purchase additional copies from publishers. Publishers highlight that library acquisitions contribute to profits in their complaint against the Internet Archive’s Controlled Digital Lending program: “Harm to and loss of community support for public libraries, in turn, hurts the publishers, since these libraries pay for their books, which, in turn, hurts authors, who share in and depend upon compensation for their copyrights.”<sup tabindex="3" id="2yVTe92N7eKA9CF4hLXPev"></sup></p><p>In that same proceeding, one executive touted the growth of revenue in the library ebook market. “In fiscal year 2015, library ebook licenses in the United States constituted 2.3% of HarperCollins’ total US ebook revenue. By fiscal year 2020, that share grew substantially to 7.4% and reached 12.9% of all US ebook revenue by mid-2021. (HarperCollins’ fiscal year ends June 30.) Indeed, as of mid-2021, HarperCollins earned over $19 million in revenue from library ebook licenses in the United States, which was nearly twice as much revenue as we earned from library ebook licenses in the United States during FY 2020.”<sup tabindex="3" id="71P3eFvQ803Nbf8CZ4z85U"></sup></p><p>It is not entirely clear how publishers understand the relationship between library acquisitions and retail sales. In a declaration that is part of the Internet Archive Controlled Digital Lending litigation, one publishing executive described conclusions he drew from OverDrive circulation data (the data and analysis itself was filed under seal). “While library ebook circulations made up 50% of the total units downloaded of trade ebooks between 2017 and 2020, ebooks obtained by libraries which resulted in those circulations brought in only 13% of total ebook revenue for Hachette…. The data discussed above has led Hachette to conclude that readers who were previously purchasing retail ebooks are switching to library ebooks, which means that we lose retail sales to free borrows.”<sup tabindex="3" id="1PkGpLgY9EiYEscceyywpR"></sup> Left unexplored in the publishers’ public analysis was how many of those library loans they believed replaced potential retail sales, how many loans per ebook publishers would view as reasonable, and how many loans per ebook libraries expect when deciding to pay for ebook access in the first place.<sup tabindex="3" id="pK3fwomnxxBS4uyBhAxFH"></sup></p><p>In one podcast, a Macmillan executive alleged that people used libraries to get around buying books: “I have a friend right now who has 11 library cards, never waits for a bestselling book, used to spend $500 a year on books.”<sup tabindex="3" id="3S6SCUF2PM0iX8gacpvFf4"></sup> Study participants affiliated with the publishing industry were often quick to point to that type of lost revenue when discussing library ebook lending in interviews.

Participants from the publishing industry often noted during our interviews that paper books tend to degrade physically, especially when they are shared.<sup tabindex="3" id="7JOgHcrpnjMJG2y0ZnK1JJ"></sup> This was often contrasted with ebooks, which were commonly described as lasting in perpetuity.<sup tabindex="3" id="1cW5Z6qd28GZND7g3Arznh"></sup> This industry understanding of the relative durability of books and ebooks – regardless of its veracity – raises questions about how to think about the value of a single copy of a book, in either physical or electronic form.</p><p>The physical fragility of paper books created an opportunity for publishers to resell copies of a popular title multiple times, especially to libraries, where books go through a lot of wear and tear as they are read by numerous patrons. As a former Big Five publishing executive explained, “Physical books fall apart. And they actually fall apart reasonably fast. Physical books get lost. Physical books don’t get returned to the library. So the library has to keep ordering the book every once in a while; think how many times your local library has ordered up Pride and Prejudice. Right? Since it was published. They’ve ordered a lot of copies of that book.”</p><p>The same former executive contrasted the fragility of physical books with ebooks: “Digital file, oh, that lasts forever. They buy it once, it lasts forever.” Another executive simply asserted that an ebook “does not degrade.”<sup tabindex="3" id="35svVqvuoS82YrXVdVk2tg"></sup></p><p>While this sentiment was common among participants, it is unclear how accurately it reflects real-world dynamics. Popular physical books may wear out quickly, but copies of other titles remain in a library’s collection for years, decades, or even centuries, waiting for the occasional patron interest. When it comes to digital, publishers have demonstrated that they can create licensing schemes that require libraries to re-purchase books at a regular interval, or after a certain number of patrons check them out.<sup tabindex="3" id="3mIGj2FW3ptR3xvKhX6kUr"></sup></p><p>Furthermore, as anyone who has ever tried to open a digital file that is more than a few years old may know, the “forever” nature of digital copies is far from proven. The Internet Archive has described the work involved in maintaining its digital collection, in that it “processes and reprocesses the books it has digitized as new optical character recognition technologies come around, as new text understanding technologies open new analysis, as formats change from djvu to daisy to epub1 to epub2 to epub3 to pdf-a and on and on. This takes thousands of computer-months and programmer-years to do this work.”<sup tabindex="3" id="6heQph82laQx73JsgLN1Et"></sup></p><p>It may be relevant that the nature of this degradation is not identical between physical books and ebooks. Physical books tend to wear out in a way that correlates with their popularity. The most popular titles wear out quickly, while less-popular titles may last in perpetuity (or at least until the acidic compounds in the paper they are printed on destroys them). In contrast, ebooks tend to become less accessible over time. All titles grow obsolete at the same rate, and all may disappear if the platform distributing them goes out of business. As that happens, the most popular titles may be the only ones that are replaced.</p><p>Regardless of their rate of decay, some libraries may devote resources to maintaining their digital collections, just as some libraries may devote resources to maintaining their physical collections. However, other libraries could adopt the same strategy for replacing outdated ebooks that they already use for worn-out physical books: purchase new copies.</p><h3 id="concentration-and-consolidation-make-it-easier-to-push-the-market-in-publishers-favor">Concentration and Consolidation Make It Easier to Push the Market in Publishers’ Favor</h3><p>The changes in copyright law and technological realities have been unfolding against a backdrop of continued concentration within the publishing industry itself. This consolidation of power among publishers made it easier to avoid competitive pressures that may have prevented the ebook market from evolving in a way that is so different from the physical book market. It has also given publishers leverage in the ebook market to force libraries to follow their lead.

While bookstores play an important part in that market, the First Sale Doctrine tends to limit their permanent influence: A bookstore’s relationship with a physical book ends the moment that it is sold. Deciding to shop at a new bookstore does not involve re-purchasing all of the books you purchased from others.</p><p>Balancing interests in the ebook market is more complex. In addition to publishers and readers, ebook platforms have ongoing interests in how ebooks are created, distributed, and controlled. Those interests exist independently from the interests of publishers and readers. Licensing allows ebook platforms to exercise that influence in an ongoing manner. In many (although not all) cases, publishers and platforms find their interests aligned when it comes to shaping the ebook market. This publisher-platform partnership rebalances the playing field in the ebook market, tilting things away from purchasers and toward the publishers and platforms.</p><p>The result is an ebook market that is designed to support the preferences of publishers and platforms, at the expense of the interests of the purchasers. It replaces sales and ownership with licenses tying ebooks to both publishers and platforms in perpetuity. These perpetual ties also create new opportunities for publishers and platforms to monetize reader data by spying on ebook readers.</p><p>While locking purchasers into platforms serves some interests of both publishers and platforms, that lock-in has unique impacts on publishers, platforms, and purchasers.</p><h3 id="digital-rights-management-technology-creates-lock-in">Digital Rights Management Technology Creates Lock-In</h3><p>Licenses are the legal tools that platforms and publishers use to control how purchasers can use ebooks. Digital Rights Management (DRM) is the primary technical tool used to implement that control, sidestepping first sale rights. Publishers and book platforms use DRM to prevent consumers from downloading, saving, sharing, and other common first sale-permitted activities. DRM tools make it very hard, if not impossible (and possibly illegal),<sup tabindex="3" id="2zOrbrYQlZRJ3xApJnfQCb"></sup> for users to move the ebooks in their collection between platforms and ereaders.<sup tabindex="3" id="6qNR8fDNkIHGNYyA5nEjeS"></sup> If a consumer licenses access to a book on Kindle, they cannot open that file on a NOOK, or on any other platform or app.</p><p>The full motivations behind implementing DRM are not always entirely clear. Many participants connected DRM with concerns about large-scale piracy.<sup tabindex="3" id="55z8DKxsx1YZ2ztsRMQ9XU"></sup> At the same time, they also noted approvingly that DRM would prevent casual lending between friends. (One publishing executive even stated that DRM played an important role in ensuring that local library spending benefited local members of the community.)<sup tabindex="3" id="46N7NktJ3BMUVUsDUMID6"></sup></p><p>While sometimes conflated by participants, stealing books and sharing books are distinct activities in the world of physical books and first sale. Printing and distributing multiple, unauthorized copies of a physical book would violate the copyright in that book. In contrast, sharing the single copy of the book you purchased with a friend would be well within your rights under copyright law.</p><p>Although the DRM benefits both publishers and platforms by reducing purchaser control over ebooks, participants suggest that the use of DRM is driven primarily by publisher demands. None of them suggested that DRM was being driven solely by the platforms. Applying DRM is a major condition for publishers to work with ebook platforms at all.</p><p>“From a retailer perspective, we still believe it’s the publisher’s problem and not so much ours,” a digital director at an ebook platform company said. “If the publisher says, I will not give you these books unless you get with the times [and implement DRM], let’s say the industry is going in a certain direction. So then we would have to do software updates to support that. But we as a retailer are not driving that decision. We would just support where it goes.”</p><p>While DRM may be driven by publisher demands, it benefits platforms as well. Several participants agree that customers get hooked into ebook platforms and say the inability to easily transfer ebook files between different platforms, particularly with Amazon, makes it difficult for customers to switch between platforms, leading to a further concentration of market share among a few dominant players.</p><p>“With ebook, there’s Digital Rights Management on ebooks so you just don’t have the cross-pollination across platforms that one would hope for,” one participant said. “If you buy from Kindle, you cannot play it on a NOOK, you cannot play it on a Kobo device, so when you’re in the ecosystem of a company, that’s pretty much where you stay.”</p><p>Participants’ mixed views on the purpose of DRM tracked responses reported by industry analyst Mike Shatzkin over a decade ago. In an informal survey of “[n]ine very high-level executives in seven different top dozen publishing houses, plus four literary agents with extremely powerful client lists,” Shatzkin reported that “[e]leven of the 13 agreed with me that DRM is necessary to protect sales. Ten of the 13 agreed with me that DRM is not an effective deterrent to piracy. And 12 of the 13 agreed with me that DRM’s main benefit is to prevent casual sharing!”<sup tabindex="3" id="5tGZBKwelDVIiZctoVEkdG"></sup> Respondents then, and study participants today, understood that DRM’s practical effect was preventing the type of casual sharing between friends that is allowed under the First Sale Doctrine, and that DRM is not an effective anti-piracy measure.</p><p>One participant, who is an executive at an ebook platform company, explained how DRM is meant to limit the legal transferability of ownership, and not just prevent illegal piracy. “Nobody wanted there to be a secondary market for ebooks, and I think mostly because nobody could imagine how you would control it or because you’re dealing with perfect replicas, like how do you ever keep that in the box?” the participant explained. “So the focus was on maintaining the perimeter through DRM, rather than a focus on ownership structure that could just prove to be impractical to try and enforce.”</p><blockquote><p>The DRM placed on ebooks, when combined with ebook licensing schemes’ limitations on first sale uses, can collapse the distinct activities of ‘lending’ and ‘piracy’ into a single violation of the license.</p></blockquote><p>The DRM placed on ebooks, when combined with ebook licensing schemes’ limitations on first sale uses, can collapse the distinct activities of “lending” and “piracy” into a single violation of the license. In doing so, the DRM, and licensing limitations, can use the pretext of preventing an illegal activity (large-scale copyright infringement) to restrict a legal activity that has long been disliked by some publishers (loaning a copy of a book to a friend).</p><p>One participant at a Big Five publisher explained it like this: “We want customers to be able to read the book, to keep the book forever. What we don’t want [is] to have someone take that ebook file and then share it with 10,000 other friends for free.”</p><p>During the Internet Archive Controlled Digital Lending proceeding, the senior VP for Online and Digital Sales at Penguin Random House also conflated the ability to lend an ebook to a friend with worldwide piracy: “If the ebook could be shared among devices belonging to multiple users, the cost would be significantly higher to reflect the broader distribution. And the price to purchase an ebook file, without restrictions on its further use or distribution, would be utterly unaffordable as a practical matter given that it could potentially satisfy global ebook demand for that title.”<sup tabindex="3" id="6RY1T53kuKgcmq7BwntNLa"></sup></p><p>Copyright law prohibits a single user from sharing a single ebook with 10,000 friends. DRM does as well. However, only DRM prohibits a user from sharing a single ebook with a single friend.</p><p>The concern that individuals lending books might undermine sales was explicitly described by other participants as well. “So I think it’s a conflicted sense around whether ebooks are good for publishing and good for the industry and whether or not they’re kind of providing the basis for either undermining sales because of consumer sales by making it easier to lend and sometimes undermining sales because of piracy,” said the participant from the trade book association.</p><p>As another participant in the digital side of one of the Big Five publishing houses explained, “[publishers] license because they want to make sure there is an artificial lifespan on the file, and an artificial cap on the sharing of that file.”</p><p>Many participants appeared to believe that DRM does effectively prevent unauthorized copies of ebooks from appearing online. A former executive at a Big Five publishing house explained that “If there weren’t enough protections, and the plain fact of the matter is, you know, 50 or 60% of the books out there were pirated, readily available for free, essentially, copyright would be gone.”</p><blockquote><p>Whatever other benefits DRM may bring to publishers, publisher insistence on applying DRM to ebooks has also undermined the development of a more-competitive platform landscape.</p></blockquote><p>Another participant in a director role at a platform company echoed this sentiment: “Once a book is out there in the world, there’s nothing to stop it from going viral. Especially, certainly, you’re never going to see that happen with a John Grisham or James Patterson [book]. … There’s no way that they would make that DRM free.”</p><p>Both of these doomsday descriptions fail to account for today’s reality in which the majority of DRM-protected ebooks are already illicitly available online.</p><p>Other industry players appear to have less confidence in DRM as an anti-piracy tool. In January 2023, International Publishers Association (IPA) President Karine Pansa claimed that the fear of unauthorized distribution of ebooks was keeping entire regions out of ebooks despite the existence of DRM: “In Africa and the Arab world, we hear publishers saying that they won’t shift to digital because the risk of piracy is too great and their copyright enforcement regimes want to protect them.”<sup tabindex="3" id="3a0UJykiQ5dALijA91wiR0"></sup></p><p>Regardless of its actual effectiveness as an anti-piracy measure, DRM has effectively reduced readers’ freedom to own the books they pay for.</p><p>Finally, DRM creates a somewhat striking dynamic between publishers and the platform companies. Whatever other benefits DRM may bring to publishers, publisher insistence on applying DRM to ebooks has also undermined the development of a more-competitive platform landscape. It is notable that even though there are clear benefits to platforms when DRM is used to lock purchasers into specific walled gardens, the industry consensus is that the use of DRM is driven by the publishers themselves. Publishers’ decades-long focus on eliminating the secondary market may have led them to insist on technology that locked them into a handful of platforms.</p><h3 id="platform-companies-use-walled-garden-infrastructure-to-make-purchaser-and-publisher-lock-in-profitable">Platform Companies Use Walled Garden Infrastructure to Make Purchaser and Publisher Lock-In Profitable</h3><p>Ebook platforms lock in publishers and purchasers by building digital walled gardens, while simultaneously collecting data from both parties. Ebook platforms lock in publishers with their distribution agreements, and they lock in users by allowing people to see ebooks only on the platform where they were originally purchased (and prohibiting downloading, sharing, and other off-platform access).<sup tabindex="3" id="xVB8NhUhuQXEYXR6cs5a9"></sup> This lock-in is in the interest of platforms, and creates some benefits for publishers. However, when it comes to walled gardens, the long-term interests of publishers and platforms may not be fully aligned.</p><p>Platforms leverage license agreements that prevent purchasers from taking their books outside the digital garden walls. This makes platforms sticky to purchasers. Once a purchaser has one ebook on a platform, they are likely to return for a second, third, and so-on. That allows platforms to convert their walled garden structure into increased ebook sales.</p><p>Ebook platform lock-in has specific impacts on libraries. Some platform schemes require libraries to pay for bundles of publications instead of picking out their own books. Before digital content was provided on internet-connected platforms, libraries had robust “collection development” teams tasked with reading through book reviews, advertisements, and other recommendations to curate their library collections title-by-title. That old model has been replaced by the modern digital platform model, in which a continuous stream of “content” is available on every library visitors’ “feed.”<sup tabindex="3" id="5UZk7DDpvxowZfnKqrofVq"></sup> In public libraries, these content collections can contain titles that are downright offensive or incorrect – in 2022, some librarians noticed that Hoopla, an OverDrive competitor, was platforming Holocaust denial propaganda and books containing incorrect information about reproductive healthcare, LGBTQIA issues, and other similarly problematic works.<sup tabindex="3" id="7ficU5VTjzXcL19BhxuP5I"></sup></p><p>As one collections development librarian at an academic library told us, this purchasers’ mindset discourages libraries from sharing digital resources and developing unique collections: “Every single library that I know of was just throwing money at the problem [during the pandemic]. Like, fine, we’ll get all of the Project Muse ebooks. Fine, we’ll get all of the JSTOR ebooks. And so we just funneled money into these publishers, but we couldn’t actually be like, okay, [my library’s] buying all of Johns Hopkins so that Yale can buy all of JSTOR and we’ll just lend. Like we couldn’t do that. We all just bought the same stuff and that’s terrible from a collection development standpoint.”</p><p>This study participant believes academic libraries are united in thinking this approach isn’t working, to the point that some university librarians are turning their collection focus back to purchasing print books: “Because [print books are] a for-sure thing, like there’s a physical object. We can lend that physical object,” the study participant added.</p><p>Libraries may choose not to participate in the ebook market because of what they perceive as restrictive, and sometimes seemingly exploitative, terms of use. The platform providers tack on digital bells and whistles to the items they sell, like product-related metrics, customer ratings, and algorithm-driven “see more like this” options. These data analytics and algorithmic features add value to the copyrighted material by giving consumers extra information about the content they’re viewing, but they are also tools for publishers to assert more control over the materials they provide to consumers. By embedding add-ons into items that used to be sold outright, publishers can claim that the raw material of their publications are inseparable from the platforms and metadata they’re attached to.<sup tabindex="3" id="3GvJoVhGUNLAuJtH1mI8Uh"></sup></p><blockquote><p>Walled garden platforms are uniquely poised to provide their owners (or those with access to their data) a ‘God’s-eye view’ of their consumers’ habits, preferences, and decision-making tendencies.</p></blockquote><p>As discussed in more detail below, these features are also tools for personal data collection and use. Walled garden platforms are uniquely poised to provide their owners (or those with access to their data) a “God’s-eye view” of their consumers’ habits, preferences, and decision-making tendencies. Publishers can use customer ratings and other consumer feedback to intuit what particular users will want, based on their data, and predict what they will buy in the future, and to decide what books to publish and what prices to charge.</p><h3 id="publishing-platforms-also-lock-in-publishers">Publishing Platforms Also Lock In Publishers</h3><p>Platforms don’t just lock in readers. They also lock in publishers. Market-dominating platforms like Amazon and OverDrive have emerged as obligatory content middlemen that publishers must cooperate with in order to have their books seen by most consumers. According to one estimate, Amazon leads the US ebook market with around 81% of the market share in 2020.<sup tabindex="3" id="6sbFyZJL9WFG1z18ckd2oq"></sup> OverDrive claims at least 90% of public libraries in the US and Canada as clients.<sup tabindex="3" id="1E9f5oEtKxIrkQnHcXtjnT"></sup></p><p>Participants regularly described how the limits of Amazon’s market-dominating Kindle, in particular, undermined economic incentives to innovate.</p><p>“We would want to create better versions of children’s books, you know, something that has, like, better picture quality, better audio, whatever. But Amazon’s devices don’t support audio. So immediately you just can’t have a read-along children’s book,” explained one participant from a Big Five publisher.</p><p>Another participant from a trade association echoed that sentiment: “That’s one of the reasons why ebooks suck. They don’t really take advantage of the medium at all [and] the least common denominator is Kindle. It’s kind of a black-and-white provisioning – Amazon doesn’t even fully support accessibility for print-disabled audiences. We could be doing a lot more with digital formats. But we’re not because the primary distribution mechanism, Amazon, you know, 80% of the market, doesn’t really care about innovation in the ebook market. And as a result, we kind of puddle along.”</p><p>In part, this dependence on third-party platforms is because many publishers prefer to outsource the process of creating and supporting ebook files to third parties. A director of an ebook distribution platform explains that ebook distribution is “just not [the publishers’] focus. Like, they’d have to create a whole structure like an ecomm [an ecommerce platform]. And some of them will have it, like [Penguin Random House] has it but, you know, an e-comm structure that gets supported and iterates… it’s a business, it’s a massive undertaking, quite honestly. And if their focus is to bring content to the world, and make some money off of it, it’s a distraction.”</p><p>Another participant working at a Big Five publisher agreed: “It just wasn’t feasible, like the amount of time and effort put into developing and maintaining the site or a space where customers can redeem their files from, really did not represent the actual sales that we were getting through those stores.”</p><p>Amazon, and other popular consumer platforms for ebooks, use their power in the ebook market to directly contradict publisher preferences. They offer publishers’ books for prices below their retail price, making it harder for publishers to recoup their publishing costs.<sup tabindex="3" id="6X9zXy9SCd7GcIXxm4x1UU"></sup> They also leverage the consumer data they collect on their platforms to prevent competing platforms from taking hold in the market,<sup tabindex="3" id="4VJm3doJQAR9FFxjVkC4bi"></sup> and they have even created their own self-publishing services that route authors away from the traditional publishers, setting up a new, rival publishing industry.<sup tabindex="3" id="4RQjZ7KIMVIK9247aMtCSe"></sup></p><p>“There’s a lot of issues tied up with the publishing industry’s relationship with Amazon, and it’s a difficult subject to speak on,” a journalist on the book industry beat said. “I’m not gonna guarantee that someone’s not going to burst through my door here and put a bag over my head and throw me in the back of the van [for agreeing to participate in this research study].”</p><p>This ownership of the ebook customer base can also give platforms like Amazon control over which books readers discover in the first place. “The ways that you would make a decision about how to buy those books feel like they’re much more controlled by the apps and what the apps recommend to you, as opposed to like, this author recommends it and it got this review,” one study participant, who wishes to remain anonymous, said. One participant with a market research group pointed out that data about consumer behavior tends to stay with the platforms and not be shared with the publishers.</p><p>“Unlike Elsevier, they don’t have a good view into [data]” the participant said. “The platforms that do own themselves… Those guys can and do use data like that to optimize their catalogs.But the publishers themselves don’t have visibility into that. And the main players like Kindle will never share it. So [publishers] are kind of at a disadvantage in that respect.</p><p>Platforms can also disrupt existing publisher-purchaser relationships. In 2020, the Association of American Publishers, the Authors Guild, and the American Booksellers Association wrote to the House Antitrust Subcommittee to urge the government to step in and provide more oversight to protect the publishing industry from Amazon.<sup tabindex="3" id="Ne43M8fWJE5j5yuWhYZzX"></sup> The publisher organizations blamed Amazon for not competing on a “level playing field when it comes to book distribution,” and claims that the ebook giant “owns and manipulates the playing field, leveraging practices from across its platform that appear to be well outside of fair and transparent competition.” And because the company is the dominant platform for so much of the ebook market, publishers have no choice but to try to make the relationship work, even though Amazon exploits them.</p><h3 id="publishers-and-purchasers-explore-creating-their-own-platforms">Publishers and Purchasers Explore Creating Their Own Platforms</h3><p>Both publishers and purchasers have attempted to sidestep some of the challenges presented by independent platforms by creating their own.</p><p>There is some evidence that at least some publishers see the value in developing their own ebook distribution platforms. Both Simon &amp; Schuster and Penguin Random House pride themselves on developing robust ebook creation and distribution pipelines. According to one participant familiar with the operation, Simon &amp; Schuster is beginning to see smaller publishers leave relationships with OverDrive and enter into distribution agreements with them instead. Direct ownership over its own ebook distribution could help Simon &amp; Schuster avoid problems that arise when its interests do not align with the interests of platforms.</p><p>There are also examples of institutional purchasers working to create their own platforms. New York Public Library (NYPL) is one of the only public library systems in the country to launch its own library lending app, which one NYPL employee said became an important initiative for reinstating contact with patrons.</p><p>“Our patrons were seeing content, content was being promoted to our patrons, that is not stuff that we would necessarily have promoted,” one NYPL employee familiar with the project said. “We were getting concerned about what that relationship looks like. Sometimes we would hear patrons talk about how, you know, they check things out from Libby [an app from OverDrive]. Well, they actually check things out from NYPL, through Libby. We were starting to lose some of that connection. [NYPL developed its own platform because] we wanted to have more control over the relationship with the patrons but also with the publishers.”</p><p>This fear of disintermediation was echoed by the publishers in their complaint against the Internet Archive’s Controlled Digital Lending program. “[Internet Archive’s] website undercuts public libraries by disintermediating them.”<sup tabindex="3" id="1Ps9GouC1NiY4yeGtksICH"></sup></p><h3 id="publishing-platforms-offer-new-benefits-to-readers-and-publishers">Publishing Platforms Offer New Benefits to Readers and Publishers</h3><p>While the platforms impose limitations on both purchasers and publishers, they also provide benefits. Ebook platforms give readers a reprieve from the performative aspects of reading a physical book in public. It’s no wonder romance fiction is one of the top ebook genres, according to study participants familiar with general purchaser habits and trends. Ebooks also have a functional appeal for some reader demographics, a director at a leading market research company explained: “Older readers tend to really like them because they can do things like have larger font sizes, they can adjust the font, they’re easier to read for people who have or are starting to have issues with their vision.”</p><p>A book industry consultant also talked about the distinction between ebooks with plain text versus ebooks with pictures and features like hyperlinks: “Ebooks have functional capabilities that print books do not have.”</p><p>Platforms offer services that keep customers coming back. For writer Louryn Strampe, Kindle’s built-in dictionary was particularly helpful when rereading a book like Gravity’s Rainbow.<sup tabindex="3" id="qtc7xl491bCT7G0UUCnJW"></sup> Other readers value knowing that an ebook listed by a platform is always available.</p><p>“They’re never out of stock,” the consultant said. “They’re never out of print. You can always deliver the next one.”</p><p>The platforms also aggregate customers and titles, increasing convenience for consumers and drawing them to books they may not ordinarily see in the course of their physical shopping errands. On digital platforms, consumers can access a particular ebook, song, or video while also interacting with elements of the online store. Consumers can shop online, browsing algorithmically curated digital collections instead of merely getting a singular, pre-selected item; personalize the items they’ve bought by creating online annotations and filing systems to hold their favorite products; leave comments and have conversations with other shoppers; and rate and rank the items they’re perusing.</p><p>While some platforms invest deeply in algorithmic recommendation and curation, other platforms intentionally avoid relying on these tools.</p><p>“Because we’re a bookseller, I think we have good curation,” one director at an ebook platform company said. “The stores are already making lots and lots of decisions every day on what they want to get behind and what’s important to the company and the idea of elevating certain writers that we think should be elevated. … Ebook, in a lot of ways, just follows what the larger goals are.”</p><p>At the same time, it is important to disentangle the benefits of platforms as a concept from the version of platforms that exist today. There is no reason that easy digital access to books must be paired with proprietary file formats that prevent customers who purchase books from bringing them elsewhere, or transferring them to someone else. There is also no reason that digital access to books must involve data extraction from consumers for marketing and other commercial purposes. Almost all platform features could also function in a world where customers owned their ebooks and were free to bring them to (or remove them from) platforms as they saw fit, without having to worry about the privacy and use of their ebook data. Similarly, there are many examples of digital goods that are sold, not licensed, online.<sup tabindex="3" id="m5PVnkYYWUgsS31uO2Yxa"></sup></p><h2 id="monetizing-data-and-tracking-users-provide-additional-incentives-for-publishers-and-platforms-to-retain-control">Monetizing Data and Tracking Users Provide Additional Incentives for Publishers and Platforms to Retain Control</h2><p>Platforms don’t just let publishers license instead of sell ebooks or lock consumers into particular walled gardens. They also create entirely new money-making opportunities in personal data and data analytics markets. While both publishers and platforms are attempting to use and monetize this data, platforms appear to be more aggressively invested in its use.</p><p>Locking readers into platforms generates data that was formerly impossible to collect. Today, platforms are able to gather location data on users, both in terms of what page they’re on and where they’re using their device. This is in stark contrast to what publishers or bookstores can track when a customer walks out the door of a bookstore with a paper book in hand. That book sale transaction has ended at the point of sale, making it impossible to know if they read the book at home, on a plane, or in a hospital. It’s impossible to know whether a reader lingers on a particular page. It’s impossible to know if a reader recommends the book to their friends. All of this data can now be harvested from ebook platforms.<sup tabindex="3" id="1q0K7nNfJtnivbmyvdFz6W"></sup></p><p>That data can be especially valuable when combined with other data and sold through data brokers. Data brokers specialize in collecting personal data or data about companies and selling or licensing that information to third parties for any number of reasons. Personal data collection and sale is a multibillion -dollar business. Data brokering, sharing, and sale to advertisers, companies, and even public institutions is a ballooning nascent business. Ebook platforms give publishers the opportunity to participate in the personal data industry. Many platforms are already there.</p><p>Ebook platforms require customers to provide personal information in order to access ebooks. This information can include your name, address, digital payment information, and whatever other personal data points the platform owner wants. Once you start using the platform, your every move on the platform becomes a data point that could be collected. While it’s not clear what types of data various platforms collect, people have discovered that Amazon tracks every time a user taps their Kindle ebook reader,<sup tabindex="3" id="3eBaVaJaexHKxnZXgV0xqj"></sup> and companies like Gale sell data analytics that tell libraries what decisions to make by “blending ebook and audiobook vendor data” with “segmentation and lifestyle data.” Gale’s ebook reader data is specific enough to mark readers’ locations on a map and provide information including their estimated household income and how many children they have.<sup tabindex="3" id="5Fs002ahHekafEKsRq7zRh"></sup></p><p>Consumer data is valuable, both to ebook platforms, and as a separate saleable item that ebook platforms and publishers can barter and sell with others. As one journalist with experience covering the topic put it: ebooks really give Amazon a wealth of customer data. “It really helps build out a customer profile, and I think that’s one of the major things that Amazon has going for it that publishers don’t, and that libraries don’t, because Amazon owns the customer. They own the customer profile. They own the data, and that’s just a huge part of how the digital environment functions.”</p><p>Platform services are a conduit for consumer data, allowing companies to track their consumers’ choices. Ebook platforms can track consumers, not just at the point of sale and beyond, but before sales occur on the platform. The companies can lead consumers to products based on their personal online habits and prior choices.</p><p>It’s no surprise that ebook platforms are following most other industries and infusing their ebook readers and ebook selection platforms with internet-connected data collectors. While it’s not clear how or if trade publishers will use this type of data, academic publishers are learning how to leverage readers’ data to manipulate the pricing of their ebooks, depending on who is using them, and by generating metrics that predict how impactful various publications will be.<sup tabindex="3" id="6Cyp7CD2CnyFwTVJzFlpUf"></sup></p><p>Ostensibly, when an ebook provider can see exactly what every one of its customers does with each of its products and services, it can use that data to understand what consumers want, even before the consumers themselves know what they want.<sup tabindex="3" id="3vJxjt8y11UkQrr6sLu1Rf"></sup> This data can also distort what books are published, replacing human editorial evaluation of new works with data-driven decisions that act to replicate what has succeeded in the past.<sup tabindex="3" id="1YD6S1YNj2oZDtFO4MVrej"></sup> Today, “Publishers can know that you raced through a novel to the end, or that you abandoned it after 20 pages.

The reality is that we’re always thinking across the industry, we have to. And I think that it will come. My job is to hopefully have it come at a time and with capabilities that support a transition to a different way of working because I don’t want it to disrupt book publishing, I want to help book publishing get better and bigger.”</p><p>Regardless of how ebook publishers and platforms are using their licensees’ and platform visitors’ data, they understand the potential value of that data and can see how academic publishing has created an entirely new data analytics market (selling author metrics, sales predictions, etc.) that is a multibillion-dollar industry.<sup tabindex="3" id="4TUo215E3ORPop3aOcZdBQ"></sup> Ebooks platforms will likely, eventually, learn how to harness the profit opportunities of “big data.” It is less clear if the publishers themselves will follow suit.</p><h3 id="publishers-are-working-to-use-reader-data">Publishers Are Working to Use Reader Data</h3><p>Most ebook platforms are already collecting myriad customer data.

In discussing the use of data with participants who work for and with publishers, a distinction emerged between marketing and production data on one hand, and manuscript evaluation on the other.</p><p>“This is a business that’s 500 years old,” said one participant from a trade association. “You know, even in the US and the current model, it’s close to 100 years old. And the reason is that we don’t use data. I mean, we just don’t really think about it. People, you kind of do shortcuts and shorthands.”</p><p>Manuscript evaluation was regularly described as something that existed outside of the world of data. “No one wants to believe that a machine can read a book and tell you anything about the book,” the same participant said. “This is what editors do. And it can only be done in an analog way reading one manuscript at a time. And you know a good book when you see it. And that’s the only way to choose a book.”</p><p>This sentiment was echoed by one former Big Five executive: “Their editors, senior editors, executive editors, publishers, and it’s all sort of intuitive, right? So it’s a business based on intuition.”</p><p>Instead of being used at the core of publishing and editing choices, data is being used for manufacturing and marketing decisions. Online tracking allows publishers to trace the journey from ebook to newsletter signups. “We also have links where it’s like, sign up for our mailing list and newsletters. We also track that to see how many customers actually, you know, subscribe to our mailing lists for ebooks,” said one Big Five employee.</p><p>One former executive leader at a publishing house explained how this information actually shaped manufacturing choices: “But to me, it should be about making the back-end efficient, making good decisions based on real data as opposed to oh, I feel really good this morning so I think I’m going to spend more money. The enhancing ability to run a productive business, you bet. How many books should we print? Human intuition should not enter that. How many orders do we have? What’s the rate that we’re selling the book at? What are the channels of distribution? Here’s how many we’re going to print, here’s the cost of the book. Here’s how long it takes us to go back to press on this type of book. Here’s the cause of piles. Man, that’s a very complex decision. Actually, do we reprint this book right now? Sometimes [it’s] really easy. But when it’s a tough decision, it’s really tough. And you need lots of data.”</p><p>There are places where marketing and manuscript evaluation can overlap. One participant on the digital side of one of the Big Five described a system where branded cookbooks could be quickly created in response to industry trends. The publisher maintained a content management system with 10,000 recipes that could be repurposed and repackaged, “They would see like, you know, okay, this Stranger Things is trending or, you know, like, which, suddenly, a lot of like witchy products are trending.

For example, a former Big Five executive’s explanation for why he does not use Spotify for his music may also resonate with concerns that others have expressed about having to license ebooks: “I don’t do Spotify and all that stuff. I do [individually purchased tracks through] Apple Music. Because I put it on my machine, and I do some of it through the cloud, then what I do is, every few years, I take a machine, and I take it offline, and I have my music. So I can always then put that back on my computer and have my music. Because you know, what happens if, I don’t know, a weather event wipes out a significant amount of the server farms in the United States? Oh you’re not gonna be able to get your stream of music or stream of anything else. And you see what Apple does with music is fantastic, right? They, in the new terms that you sign on in order to have your iTunes and all those songs you bought over the last 25 years. They have the right to swap out versions and they do it all the time. So suddenly your favorite acoustic version of that song that you love and you’ve been listening to for 20 years, you put it on and it’s a different song. It’s the same song, but it’s a different performance. They just swap it out.

While there is no direct evidence to suggest explicit coordination, the increasing concentration in both the publishing and platform markets for ebooks, coupled with the massive simultaneous shift from sales to licensing, raises important questions about the nature and extent of any implicit or explicit coordination. For example, the near-universal refusal to offer individual or institutional consumers the option to legally own an ebook at any price raises the possibility that some agreement might be responsible.</p><p>The absence of this option, on top of publisher-platform-reader lock-in, whereby access to books is prohibited on other platforms, could create substantial barriers to entry for new participants.</p><p>Two solutions can address these problems. One is to mandate that any ebook purchased should be delivered in a format that allows interoperability between ebook reading platforms. This would allow both purchasers and publishers to shift from platform to platform depending on which ones offer them the most competitive and preferred treatment, including new entrants to the market. The second solution is to mandate that vendors offer the option to “buy” ebooks (as opposed to rent/stream/license or more “temporal” transactions). This would require vendors to offer the ebook with the incidents of digital ownership, including the right to preserve the copy they buy, resell it, and be free of surveillance while they read it.<sup tabindex="3" id="71963W19xRWdR4zOVDQOO6"></sup></p><h3 id="economic-examinations-of-the-ebook-market-should-distinguish-between-the-market-for-digital-ownership-of-ebooks-and-the-market-for-platform-controlled-licensing-of-ebooks">Economic Examinations of the Ebook Market Should Distinguish Between the Market for Digital Ownership of Ebooks and the Market for Platform-Controlled Licensing of Ebooks</h3><p>At the same time that publishers have been investing more heavily in ebook platforms and less in traditional ebook sales, they are suing one library, the Internet Archive, for offering ebook loans under a system called Controlled Digital Lending (CDL).<sup tabindex="3" id="7DIkkqi8ervoPlNMVVBh5E"></sup> CDL is a special system for library ebook lending that uses technology to follow a first sale framework. For example, libraries can lend out only one ebook copy at a time for each physical copy of the book they own.<sup tabindex="3" id="2VmQYmd8FkpBczcvcGre6K"></sup> This “owned-to-loaned” ratio simulates the economics of first sale for physical library books, where each physical book owned can be loaned to only one patron at a time. CDL is currently being implemented by a wide range of libraries in a wide range of ways.</p><p>The reasons behind the CDL lawsuit may be related to publishers’ ongoing belief that library loans cost them profits, and that shutting down digital library loans will recoup those losses. As noted in this paper, that belief was shaped by a physical book environment where readers were choosing between purchasing a book from a bookstore or borrowing a functionally identical copy of a book from the library.</p><blockquote><p>The complexities of these platform economics raise serious questions about how digital library lending, especially under a CDL approach, competes with current publisher business models.</p></blockquote><p>However, the ebook marketplace looks very different from this physical book model. Bookstore ebook sales are a small and diminishing part of the market. Instead, licensed copies distributed via surveillance-driven platforms dominate the market, generating revenue from individual and bulk purchases, as well as subscriptions, advertising, and data analytics. The complexities of these platform economics raise serious questions about how digital library lending, especially under a CDL approach, competes with current publisher business models. This ambiguity is particularly relevant to the Internet Archive lawsuit, as one of the four “fair use” factors at issue in the case is the effect of CDL on the market for the books being lent out. The greater the difference in the economic model of digital ownership versus platform-controlled licensing, the less market harm publishers can prove.</p><h3 id="digital-ownership-should-be-normalized-instead-of-publisher-refusal-to-sell-ebooks">Digital Ownership Should Be Normalized Instead of Publisher Refusal to Sell Ebooks</h3><p>The deals that vendors strike with libraries on behalf of publishers often come with nondisclosure agreements libraries are expected to sign, waiving their right to talk about the different deals vendors are able to score with different libraries. This anti-competitive practice discourages librarians from inquiring about the deals vendors make with other libraries to determine whether or not they are getting a raw deal. Through our interviews with different participants, we learned that some academic libraries are opting to return back to purchasing physical books as a way to get around the constraints of ebook licenses.</p><p>Academic publishers, including MIT Press, are looking at preservation in terms of perpetual access, even though public libraries, who are not frequent purchasers of academic press books, are more likely to concede to a perpetual access license because the mission of public libraries is more preservation-oriented. One source with a larger metro public library system said that it viewed perpetual access as a form of preservation if proper backups are in place: “If we’re licensing ebooks and we get a perpetual license to those ebooks, there’s always the threat that the company that’s licensing it to us goes down and we lose that access. So we’ve built some preservation requirements into these things that say that you the publisher actually have to deposit copies into escrow, and they sit on this server that we can’t access until or unless the company goes bankrupt. At that point, the server unlocks and now we get access to all this content that we actually paid for. But now we get to preserve it because the company that licensed it to us originally went away.” Whether more libraries can negotiate these types of contractual agreements depends on how well resourced the staff at each system is, as well as how this would apply to their specific collection priorities and needs.</p><h3 id="library-privacy-laws-should-be-updated-to-preserve-intellectual-freedom-on-ebook-platforms">Library Privacy Laws Should Be Updated to Preserve Intellectual Freedom on Ebook Platforms</h3><p>Academic publishers are already using purchasers’ personal data to assess researchers’ impact and to do other data analytics. Right now, it is unclear whether, or how, trade publishers will use personal data to predict and assess consumers’ habits, but we know that ebook platforms are using personal data to assess customers’ reading habits and for “more like this” advertising and other marketing and tools used to track and assess consumer preferences and trends.</p><p>In light of the platforms’ data collections and use, and the potential for publishers to similarly use purchasers’ data, lawmakers should ensure that data privacy laws protect consumers that use ebook platforms.</p><p>Library professionals and legal scholars have carved out a special privacy right for people as they read and research.<sup tabindex="3" id="2aINC10CkzakshRmOw6slr"></sup> Librarian ethics include “intellectual freedom,” the principle of a private right to read and research based on the idea that people should be able to read, learn, and debate without being monitored and recorded.<sup tabindex="3" id="2S8H8hXapmJb8bR6slCFSX"></sup> The right of every individual to both seek and receive information from all points of view without restriction is inherent in First Amendment freedoms of speech, association, and assembly. When people know that their research and reading habits are being tracked and recorded, it has a chilling effect on people’s ability to seek information. Most states have laws that protect people’s library records as confidential,<sup tabindex="3" id="3XFqcYZpgLOoWkhxTKCDCr"></sup> and those laws should be updated to ensure that they cover ebook platforms. These laws codify the American Library Association’s best practices to protect intellectual freedom, including keeping circulation records and other patron-identifying records confidential.<sup tabindex="3" id="ONr1MqzjqHvs3kbb8TMZq"></sup> Librarians also lobbied state governments to pass library patron privacy laws to safeguard print book readers’ privacy, convincing every state to pass a library-patron privacy law. (The two states that lack privacy laws have attorney generals’ opinions guaranteeing library privacy.)<sup tabindex="3" id="293CmfG5Hj0AIkhQSTW4gh"></sup></p><p>These library laws were passed long before ebooks and the ebook platform industry existed. The lawmakers and librarians that drafted library privacy legislation did not imagine our current ebook systems, and they did not predict that personal data analytics would become a prominent feature of book marketing or a copyright-protection measure on most digital information platforms. Many states have updated their library privacy laws to include email records and electronic book circulation trackers (associated with library card barcodes, etc.), but few have been amended to account for internet-connected ebook platforms and ereaders. Librarians have raised their concerns about the threats ebook platforms pose to their patrons’ intellectual freedom, but state legislators have yet to update the laws to reflect those concerns.<sup tabindex="3" id="2nof5tpEpFQ59C6PVr4kug"></sup></p><p>As we wait for data privacy legislation in Congress, states could update their library privacy laws to increase their scope, if they haven’t already done so. Today’s library privacy laws should protect as confidential records all of the personal data collected in libraries, including data collected by third-party vendors, as they do paper and other electronic library records.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>On behalf of the Thunderbird team, <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Modules/Thunderbird#Thunderbird_Council">Thunderbird Council</a>, our global community of contributors, and our extended Mozilla family, I am incredibly excited to announce the initial launch of Thunderbird 115 “Supernova” for Linux, macOS, and Windows! With this year’s version, we’re delivering much more than just another yearly release. Supernova represents a modernized overhaul of the software – both visually and technically – while retaining the familiarity and flexibility you expect from Thunderbird.</p>



<p>“Supernova is the beginning of a new era for Thunderbird,” says Ryan Sipes, Thunderbird’s Product and Business Development Manager. “It lays a beautiful, solid groundwork for future releases that will make Thunderbird a significantly better email client – and we won’t stop until it’s the best option out there.”</p>



<p>“During the past year we reworked some of the oldest parts of our code base with the goal of modernizing them to make maintenance and extensibility easier,” says Alex Castellani, Thunderbird’s Director of Product Engineering. “We did our best to strike a comfortable balance between new features and interface changes to appeal to new users, while maintaining the current layout and interface that millions of our users know and love. This is <a href="https://blog.thunderbird.net/2023/02/the-future-of-thunderbird-why-were-rebuilding-from-the-ground-up/">the first step</a> towards a more flexible, reliable, and customizable Thunderbird that will accommodate different needs, preferences, and workflows.”</p>



<p>Here’s a brief look at some of the best new features and improvements in Thunderbird 115. For the complete list, please visit <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/new-thunderbird-115-supernova">this support article</a>.</p>



<hr>



<h3>Modernized Cards View</h3>



<figure><a href="https://blog.thunderbird.net/files/2023/07/115.png"><img decoding="async" width="1680" height="1050" src="https://blog.thunderbird.net/files/2023/07/115.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.thunderbird.net/files/2023/07/115.png 1680w, https://blog.thunderbird.net/files/2023/07/115-252x158.png 252w, https://blog.thunderbird.net/files/2023/07/115-600x375.png 600w, https://blog.thunderbird.net/files/2023/07/115-768x480.png 768w, https://blog.thunderbird.net/files/2023/07/115-1536x960.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1680px) 100vw, 1680px"></a></figure>



<p>Supernova’s new Card View is our version of the well-known vertical layout for the Message List, perfect for people used to modern webmail. Card View emulates a mobile interface list with multi-line support, offering a more comfortable appearance to reduce cognitive burden. (And because we want Supernova to feel familiar for veteran users, the legacy “Table” view is still available.)</p>



<h3>Brand New Thunderbird Logo</h3>



<p>Supernova ships with a brand new Thunderbird logo honoring our history and vital connection to Mozilla, while representing the revitalization of our brand and a promising, sustainable future.</p>


<div>
<figure><a href="https://blog.thunderbird.net/files/2023/07/appmenu-default.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://blog.thunderbird.net/files/2023/07/appmenu-default.png" alt="" width="189" height="297" srcset="https://blog.thunderbird.net/files/2023/07/appmenu-default.png 273w, https://blog.thunderbird.net/files/2023/07/appmenu-default-252x396.png 252w" sizes="(max-width: 189px) 100vw, 189px"></a><figcaption>New Thunderbird AppMenu ≡</figcaption></figure></div>


<h3>Dynamic Unified Toolbar</h3>



<p>Supernova features a single dynamic toolbar, presenting frequently used and contextual options based on the tab or Space that is currently active. Take full control by customizing the toolbar and window layout to perfectly fit your workflow.</p>



<h3>Intuitive AppMenu</h3>



<p>The new Application Menu (≡) in Supernova is now keyboard-accessible, and redesigned for faster, easier navigation. Fewer submenus, persistent global options, and consistent iconography combine to create a much more intuitive experience.</p>



<h3>Improved Calendar Design</h3>



<figure><a href="https://blog.thunderbird.net/files/2023/07/cal.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://blog.thunderbird.net/files/2023/07/cal.png" alt="" width="840" height="531" srcset="https://blog.thunderbird.net/files/2023/07/cal.png 1554w, https://blog.thunderbird.net/files/2023/07/cal-252x160.png 252w, https://blog.thunderbird.net/files/2023/07/cal-600x380.png 600w, https://blog.thunderbird.net/files/2023/07/cal-768x486.png 768w, https://blog.thunderbird.net/files/2023/07/cal-1536x973.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px"></a></figure>



<p>As part of an ongoing effort to modernize and upgrade Thunderbird’s Calendar, Supernova introduces an improved “mini-month” layout, improvements to the day/week/month grid, a pleasing color palette, and several more minor changes.</p>



<h3>Elegant Density Control</h3>



<figure><a href="https://blog.thunderbird.net/files/2023/07/Appmenu_Density@2x.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://blog.thunderbird.net/files/2023/07/Appmenu_Density@2x.png" alt="" width="596" height="596" srcset="https://blog.thunderbird.net/files/2023/07/Appmenu_Density@2x.png 1400w, https://blog.thunderbird.net/files/2023/07/Appmenu_Density@2x-252x252.png 252w, https://blog.thunderbird.net/files/2023/07/Appmenu_Density@2x-600x600.png 600w, https://blog.thunderbird.net/files/2023/07/Appmenu_Density@2x-160x160.png 160w, https://blog.thunderbird.net/files/2023/07/Appmenu_Density@2x-768x768.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 596px) 100vw, 596px"></a><figcaption>Change your density setting and font size easily from the new AppMenu</figcaption></figure>



<p>Working with multiple monitors and display resolutions? Supernova lets you dial in the perfect density settings and font sizes for the entire application, with just a single click from the AppMenu.</p>



<h3>New + Sortable Folder Modes</h3>


<div>
<figure><a href="https://blog.thunderbird.net/files/2023/07/folderpane.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://blog.thunderbird.net/files/2023/07/folderpane.png" alt="" width="218" height="528" srcset="https://blog.thunderbird.net/files/2023/07/folderpane.png 284w, https://blog.thunderbird.net/files/2023/07/folderpane-252x610.png 252w" sizes="(max-width: 218px) 100vw, 218px"></a></figure></div>


<p>Supernova gives you more control by introducing sortable Folder Modes. Display all of your Tags in the Folder Pane, turn on and off Local Folders, or move your favorite Folder Mode sections up and down with one click. Less scrolling, more productivity.</p>



<h3>Eye-Catching Tags View</h3>



<p>Tags are a familiar and powerful part of your workflow, so Supernova adds an eye-catching “Tags” view to the Folder Pane. Quickly jump to your custom, color-coded tag categories to find and filter your messages even faster.</p>



<h3>Improved Address Book</h3>



<p>Supernova continues to iterate on the modernized Address Book introduced in Thunderbird 102. You’ll enjoy a new tabular view, an improved Edit view, delete buttons, and better accessibility.</p>



<h3>Better Accessibility</h3>



<p>Speaking of accessibility, Supernova substantially improves Thunderbird’s keyboard navigation and screen reader accessibility across the entire application. We’ve also greatly expanded the ability to navigate Mail content and buttons using the TAB and arrow keys.</p>



<h3>More To Come…</h3>



<p>Supernova is constantly evolving. Throughout the next year, we’ll deliver many improvements to existing Supernova features and introduce brand new ones, including Thunderbird Sync. Upgrade to version 115 and experience the future of Thunderbird!</p>



<hr>



<h3>How To Get Thunderbird 115 “Supernova”</h3>



<p>As with any major release, we sometimes become aware of corner cases after significant public testing. The Thunderbird team will wait to enable automatic updates until we’re confident no such issues exist. We’ll keep you posted right here, and on social media platforms. (Existing Thunderbird 102 users will continue to see security updates during this time).&nbsp;</p>



<p>On Linux, the timing of this release and subsequent automatic updates may be determined by your distribution’s maintainers. If it’s convenient for you, we recommend installing the <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/org.mozilla.Thunderbird">Thunderbird Flatpak from Flathub</a>, which is now packaged and maintained by the Thunderbird team.&nbsp;(Please note that 115 is <em>not </em>live on Flathub at time of publication, but as always we’ll keep you updated.)</p>



<p>If you don’t want to wait for an automatic update, Thunderbird 115 is also available to download directly at <a href="https://thunderbird.net/">thunderbird.net</a> for Windows, Linux, and macOS. </p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

                

                
                    
                        <p>Hey folks, welcome to the digest! Today’s issue is about a pain point developers encounter when shipping desktop-class apps to the browser.</p>
<h2>File editors and database apps</h2>
<p>Most desktop applications are what I call <strong>file editors</strong>.</p>
<p>By file editor, I mean that the user selects a file on disk, and the program loads it into memory. User changes are applied in-memory and periodically saved back to disk.</p>
<p>Most <em>web</em> apps, by contrast, are what I call <strong>database apps</strong>.</p>
<p>Instead of loading a whole file into memory upfront, database apps render views of the data by fetching data from a database as needed to render the UI. When the user makes changes to the data, those changes are persisted back to the database via API calls.</p>
<p>Database apps are a good fit for “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete" target="_blank">CRUD</a>” tools like calendars, todo lists, and tools with three-letter acronyms containing “manager” (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system" target="_blank">CMS</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management" target="_blank">CRM</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_information_management" target="_blank">PIM</a>).</p>
<p>One of the challenges of writing desktop-class software that runs in the browser is that file editors do not translate as naturally to the architecture of the web as database apps do.</p>
<p>To understand why these apps work differently, let's look at one.</p>

<p>The design tool <a href="https://figma.com/" target="_blank">Figma</a> is a good example of a file editor that runs in the browser.</p>
<p>When you open a Figma design, your browser downloads (over WebSocket) a “Fig file” corresponding to that design. The file contains binary data serialized with <a href="https://github.com/evanw/kiwi/tree/master" target="_blank">kiwi</a>. Kiwi is a binary format similar to Google’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol_Buffers" target="_blank">Protobuf</a>, open-sourced by former Figma CTO Evan Wallace.</p>
<p>You can think of a kiwi file essentially as compressed JSON. Officially, the kiwi schema used by Figma is <a href="https://forum.figma.com/t/inquiry-about-the-fig-file-format/6351/2" target="_blank">undocumented</a>, but there have been some <a href="https://github.com/liaobinbin/fig-to-json/tree/main" target="_blank">attempts to reverse-engineer</a> it, and <a href="https://blog.photopea.com/photopea-4-6-open-figma-files.html" target="_blank">at least one third-party tool</a> supports it.</p>
<p>Translated to JSON by a third-party tool, it looks something like this:</p>
<p><img alt="image.png" src="https://buttondown.imgix.net/images/f751c5c0-e72e-4d9f-b855-752ff4a0627d.png?w=960&amp;fit=max"></p>
<h2>S3 as a filesystem</h2>
<p>Figma persists these Fig files to Amazon S3.</p>
<p>A naive approach would have been for the client to treat S3 like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_File_System" target="_blank">network file system</a> and use it the same way a desktop app would use its local file system. This would have two problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>The whole file would have to be sent for every change, which is a waste of bandwidth as files get large.</li>
<li>Figma supports multiple concurrent users per document. If every change caused the entire document to be rewritten, race conditions from concurrent edits would cause data loss.</li>
</ul>
<p>Figma avoids both of these problems by taking a <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/how-figmas-multiplayer-technology-works/" target="_blank">more sophisticated approach</a>. When you open a Fig file, it’s actually loaded in two places: in your browser, and on a server.</p>
<p>Instead of writing back the entire file on each change, clients stream back only the changed data. The server applies those changes to its own in-memory copy to keep it synchronized.</p>
<p>The tricky part is that when multiple users open the same Fig file concurrently, Figma’s infrastructure needs to ensure that they are all connected to the same server. That server can then be the sole authority on the state of that document, and write to it without race conditions.</p>
<h2>Why not use a database?</h2>
<p>Figma <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/how-figma-scaled-to-multiple-databases/" target="_blank">stores file metadata</a> in a Postgres database. Instead of going to the trouble of using S3 too, they could have also used the database for document data, in one of two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>They could stuff the whole document into a binary blob or json(b) column next to the metadata.</li>
<li>They could represent the document itself as rows and tables in a relational database.</li>
</ol>
<p>#1 is essentially (ab)using the database as a file system, <a href="https://www.brentozar.com/archive/2021/07/store-files-in-a-file-system-not-a-relational-database/" target="_blank">which is bad</a>.</p>
<p>#2 at least has the aura of using the database <em>as a database</em>, but it adds a bunch of complexity to the application layer, which needs to be able to translate between a document representation in memory and a relational representation in the database.</p>
<p>In either case, another consideration at scale is that S3 can be 10-100x cheaper byte-for-byte than a database. The query capabilities available in a database come at the cost of computational overhead, and it’s a waste to pay that overhead when you have a known, file-like access pattern.</p>
<h2>Durability</h2>
<p>Writing the whole document to S3 is relatively slow, so Figma only does it every 30-60 seconds. But if the system responsible for writing those checkpoints fails (say, the power goes out), Figma doesn’t want to lose 30-60 seconds worth of changes. So they <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/making-multiplayer-more-reliable/" target="_blank">buffer changes</a> at a higher frequency by saving them to DynamoDB, as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write-ahead_logging" target="_blank">write-ahead log</a>.</p>
<h2>Generalizing Figma’s approach</h2>
<p>This post came out of research we’ve been doing towards building an open-source document database that takes a similar approach.</p>
<p>Recently, we introduced <a href="https://docs.jamsocket.com/locking-a-backend-to-a-resource/" target="_blank">“locking”</a> into Jamsocket and <a href="https://plane.dev/" target="_blank">Plane</a>, which can guarantee that at most one backend runs per document, motivated by desire for a Figma-like data architecture.</p>
<p>If these problems resonate with problems you’ve experienced building browser-based apps, please drop me a line by replying to this email, I’d love to learn more about the problems you’ve encountered.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Congress members revealed the <a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Attacks%20on%20Tax%20Privacy_Formatted.pdf">results</a> of a seven-month investigation into tax-filing companies. Lawmakers found that H&amp;R Block, TaxAct, and TaxSlayer "recklessly shared" potentially hundreds of millions of taxpayers' sensitive personal and financial data with Google and Meta "for years" in apparent violation of laws prohibiting tax preparers from sharing tax return information without customers' consent.</p>
<p>In a press release provided to Ars from the office of Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), lawmakers alleged a "massive, likely illegal breach of taxpayer privacy." Insisting upon urgent redress, lawmakers are now calling upon the Department of Justice, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the Federal Trade Commission, and the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration to "fully investigate this matter and prosecute any company or individuals who violated the law."</p>
<p>The Congress members' report said that "any tax return preparer who 'knowingly or recklessly discloses'" tax return information "is subject to a fine up to $1,000 per violation, and a prison term of up to one year."</p>
<p>"The companies shared millions of taxpayers’ tax return data, meaning they could face billions of dollars in potential criminal liability," lawmakers wrote in a <a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2023.07.11%20Letter%20to%20IRS,%20TIGTA,%20FTC,%20DOJ%20on%20tax%20prep%20pixel%20data%20sharing.pdf">letter</a> to federal agencies.</p>
<p>For its investigation, congressional staff interviewed representatives at tax-filing sites, as well as at Meta and Google. These interviews uncovered what their report said was "a troubling pattern and practice of data sharing by tax prep companies, a complete lack of corporate responsibility and accountability on the part of tax prep companies and Big Tech firms, and a potentially illegal use of sensitive taxpayer information."</p>
<p>"Under the law, 'a tax return preparer may not disclose or use a taxpayer’s tax return information prior to obtaining a written consent from the taxpayer,'" lawmakers' letter said.</p>
<p>The only exception allows for data sharing with "auxiliary service providers" working "in connection with the preparation of a tax return." However, lawmakers said that "Meta and Google likely do not meet the definition of 'auxiliary service providers,'" partly because "the data sharing with Meta was for advertising purposes—not 'in connection with the preparation of a tax return.'"</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>The congressional probe followed a bombshell <a href="https://themarkup.org/pixel-hunt/2022/11/22/tax-filing-websites-have-been-sending-users-financial-information-to-facebook">report</a> from The Markup in November 2022, revealing that tax-filing websites had been sharing customers' sensitive financial information with Meta. After being contacted by The Markup, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/11/major-tax-filing-websites-secretly-share-income-data-with-meta/">all three tax-filing websites confirmed</a> that they'd removed or disabled the Meta Pixel tracking tools that were gathering sensitive data.</p>
<p>But while tax-filing websites were quick to stop collecting data, nobody's sure how much information was collected. One unnamed company told Congress that "every single taxpayer who used their websites could have had at least some of their data shared."</p>
<p>Lawmakers in their letter called tax prep companies "untrustworthy and incompetent." Attempting to research if tax prep companies had gained consent to disclose and use data from its users, Congress was blocked by the companies, who refused to "provide current and historical versions of disclosure agreements and privacy policies." Undeterred, Congress consulted Internet archives to access historical versions of company policies and pieced together that none of the companies appeared to have gained consent from their customers to share the sensitive data with Meta and Google.</p>
<p>TaxSlayer and H&amp;R Block did not immediately responded to Ars' request to comment, but a TaxAct spokesperson told Ars that the company cooperated with lawmakers and works to protect user privacy.</p>
<p>"TaxAct has engaged with Senator Warren and her staff to provide transparent, detailed explanations on our use of these standard analytics tools," TaxAct's spokesperson told Ars. "TaxAct has always complied with laws that protect our customers’ privacy and, as noted in the report, we disabled the tools in question while we evaluated potential concerns. Protecting the rights and privacy of our customers is our top priority, and we are committed to engaging with stakeholders to address any concerns and to help advance public policy."</p>
<p>A Meta spokesperson told Ars that Meta stands by a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/11/major-tax-filing-websites-secretly-share-income-data-with-meta/">statement provided to Ars</a> last year, saying that “advertisers should not send sensitive information about people through our business tools. Doing so is against our policies and we educate advertisers on properly setting up business tools to prevent this from occurring. Our system is designed to filter out potentially sensitive data it is able to detect.”</p>
<p>A Google spokesperson told Ars that the company has "strict policies and technical features that prohibit Google Analytics customers from collecting data that could be used to identify an individual. Site owners—not Google —are in control of what information they collect and must inform their users of how it will be used. Additionally, Google has strict policies against advertising to people based on sensitive information.”</p>
