                                        <p>The <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/immigration-chicago-arrests-police-federal-5c21bcb2cd890fcb086480469c1a3a96">U.S. Border Patrol</a></span> is monitoring millions of American drivers nationwide in a secretive program to identify and detain people whose travel patterns it deems suspicious, The Associated Press has found.</p><p>The predictive intelligence program has resulted in people being stopped, searched and in some cases arrested. A network of cameras scans and records vehicle license plate information, and an algorithm flags vehicles deemed suspicious based on where they came from, where they were going and which route they took. Federal agents in turn may then flag local law enforcement.</p><p>Suddenly, drivers find themselves pulled over — often for reasons cited such as speeding, failure to signal, the wrong window tint or even a dangling air freshener blocking the view. They are then aggressively questioned and searched, with no inkling that the roads they drove put them on law enforcement’s radar.</p>
    
<p>Once limited to policing the nation’s boundaries, the Border Patrol has built a surveillance system stretching into the country’s interior that can monitor ordinary Americans’ daily actions and connections for anomalies instead of simply targeting wanted suspects. Started about a decade ago to fight illegal border-related activities and the trafficking of both drugs and people, it has expanded over the past five years.</p><div data-align-center="" data-video-orientation="portrait">
                
                
                
                <p>Border Patrol is using hidden license plate readers to track drivers and flag “suspicious” travel patterns, an AP investigation found, raising concerns over secret surveillance.</p>
                
            
        </div>



<p>The Border Patrol has recently grown even more powerful through collaborations with other agencies, drawing information from license plate readers nationwide run by the <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/us-drug-enforcement-administration">Drug Enforcement Administration</a></span>, private companies and, increasingly, local law enforcement programs funded through federal grants. Texas law enforcement agencies have asked Border Patrol to use facial recognition to identify drivers, documents show.</p>

<p>This active role beyond the borders is part of the quiet transformation of its parent agency, <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/us-customs-and-border-protection">U.S. Customs and Border Protection</a></span>, into something more akin to a domestic intelligence operation. Under the Trump administration’s heightened immigration enforcement efforts, CBP is now poised to get more than $2.7 billion to build out border surveillance systems such as the license plate reader program by layering in artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies.</p>
    
    
    
<p>The result is a mass surveillance network with a particularly American focus: cars.</p><p>This investigation, the first to reveal details of how the program works on America’s roads, is based on interviews with eight former government officials with direct knowledge of the program who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to speak to the media, as well as dozens of federal, state and local officials, attorneys and privacy experts. The AP also reviewed thousands of pages of court and government documents, state grant and law enforcement data, and arrest reports.</p><p>The Border Patrol has for years hidden details of its license plate reader program, trying to keep any mention of the program out of court documents and police reports, former officials say, even going so far as to propose dropping charges rather than risk revealing any details about the placement and use of their covert license plate readers. Readers are often disguised along highways in traffic safety equipment like drums and barrels.</p>
    
<p>The Border Patrol has defined its own criteria for which drivers’ behavior should be deemed suspicious or tied to drug or human trafficking, stopping people for anything from driving on backcountry roads, being in a rental car or making short trips to the border region. The agency’s network of cameras now extends along the southern border in Texas, Arizona and California, and also monitors drivers traveling near the U.S.-Canada border.</p><p>And it reaches far into the interior, impacting residents of big metropolitan areas and people driving to and from large cities such as Chicago and Detroit, as well as from Los Angeles, San Antonio, and Houston to and from the Mexican border region. In one example, AP found the agency has placed at least four cameras in the greater Phoenix area over the years, one of which was more than 120 miles (193 kilometers) from the Mexican frontier, beyond the agency’s usual jurisdiction of 100 miles (161 kilometers) from a land or sea border. The AP also identified several camera locations in metropolitan Detroit, as well as one placed near the Michigan-Indiana border to capture traffic headed towards Chicago or Gary, Indiana, or other nearby destinations.</p><div data-align-fullwidth="">

While the U.S. Border Patrol primarily operates within 100 miles of the border, it is legally allowed “to operate anywhere in the United States,” the agency added. </p>
    
<p>While collecting license plates from cars on public roads has generally been upheld by courts, some legal scholars see the growth of large digital surveillance networks such as Border Patrol’s as raising constitutional questions.

                </div><p>In February, Lorenzo Gutierrez Lugo, a driver for a small trucking company that specializes in transporting furniture, clothing and other belongings to families in Mexico, was driving south to the border city of Brownsville, Texas, carrying packages from immigrant communities in South Carolina’s low country.</p><p>Gutierrez Lugo was pulled over by a local police officer in Kingsville, a small Texas city near Corpus Christi that lies about 100 miles (161 kilometers) from the Mexican border. The officer, Richard Beltran, cited the truck’s speed of 50 mph (80 kph) in a 45 mph (72 kph) zone as the reason for the stop.</p>
    
<p>But speeding was a pretext: Border Patrol had requested the stop and said the black Dodge pickup with a white trailer could contain contraband, according to police and court records. U.S. Route 77 passes through Kingsville, a route that state and federal authorities scrutinize for trafficking of drugs, money and people.</p><p>Gutierrez Lugo, who through a lawyer declined to comment, was interrogated about the route he drove, based on license plate reader data, per the police report and court records. He consented to a search of his car by Beltran and Border Patrol agents, who eventually arrived to assist.</p>

</div>
    
<p>They unearthed no contraband. But Beltran arrested Gutierrez Lugo on suspicion of money laundering and engaging in organized criminal activity because he was carrying thousands of dollars in cash — money his supervisor said came directly from customers in local Latino communities, who are accustomed to paying in cash. No criminal charges were ultimately brought against Gutierrez Lugo and an effort by prosecutors to seize the cash, vehicle and trailer as contraband was eventually dropped.</p><p>Luis Barrios owns the trucking company, Paquetería El Guero, that employed the driver. He told AP he hires people with work authorization in the United States and was taken aback by the treatment of his employee and his trailer.</p>
    
<p>“We did everything right and had nothing to hide, and that was ultimately what they found,” said Barrios, who estimates he spent $20,000 in legal fees to clear his driver’s name and get the trailer out of impound.</p><p>Border Patrol agents and local police have many names for these kinds of stops: “whisper,” “intel” or “wall” stops. Those stops are meant to conceal — or wall off — that the true reason for the stop is a tip from federal agents sitting miles away, watching data feeds showing who’s traveling on America’s roads and predicting who is “suspicious,” according to documents and people interviewed by the AP.</p><p>In 2022, a man from Houston had his car searched from top to bottom by Texas sheriff’s deputies outside San Antonio after they got a similar tipoff from Border Patrol agents about the driver, Alek Schott.</p><div data-align-fullwidth="">

They knew he stayed overnight in a hotel about 80 miles (129 kilometers) from the U.S.-Mexico border. They knew that in the morning Schott met a female colleague there before they drove together to a business meeting.</p><p>At Border Patrol’s request, Schott was pulled over by Bexar County sheriff’s deputies. The deputies held Schott by the side of the road for more than an hour, searched his car and found nothing.</p><p>“The beautiful thing about the Texas Traffic Code is there’s thousands of things you can stop a vehicle for,” said Joel Babb, the sheriff’s deputy who stopped Schott’s car, in a deposition in a lawsuit Schott filed alleging violations of his constitutional rights.</p><div data-align-fullwidth="">

                </div><p>According to testimony and documents released as part of Schott’s lawsuit, Babb was on a group chat with federal agents called Northwest Highway. Babb deleted the WhatsApp chat off his phone but Schott’s lawyers were able to recover some of the text messages.</p><p>Through a public records act request, the AP also obtained more than 70 pages of the Northwest Highway group chats from June and July of this year from a Texas county that had at least one sheriff’s deputy active in the chat. The AP was able to associate numerous phone numbers in both sets of documents with Border Patrol agents and Texas law enforcement officials.</p><p>The chat logs show Border Patrol agents and Texas sheriffs deputies trading tips about vehicles’ travel patterns — based on suspicions about little more than someone taking a quick trip to the border region and back. The chats show how thoroughly Texas highways are surveilled by this federal-local partnership and how much detailed information is informally shared.</p><p>In one exchange a law enforcement official included a photo of someone’s driver’s license and told the group the person, who they identified using an abbreviation for someone in the country illegally, was headed westbound. “Need BP?,” responded a group member whose number was labeled “bp Intel.” “Yes sir,” the official answered, and a Border Patrol agent was en route.</p><p>Border Patrol agents and local law enforcement shared information about U.S. citizens’ social media profiles and home addresses with each other after stopping them on the road. Chats show Border Patrol was also able to determine whether vehicles were rentals and whether drivers worked for rideshare services.</p><div data-align-fullwidth="">

                </div><p>Today, the deserts, forests and mountains of the nation’s land borders are dotted with checkpoints and increasingly, surveillance towers, Predator drones, thermal cameras and license plate readers, both covert and overt.</p><p>Border Patrol’s parent agency got authorization to run a domestic license plate reader program in 2017, according to a <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/us-department-of-homeland-security">Department of Homeland Security</a></span> policy document. At the time, the agency said that it might use hidden license plate readers ”for a set period of time while CBP is conducting an investigation of an area of interest or smuggling route. Once the investigation is complete, or the illicit activity has stopped in that area, the covert cameras are removed,” the document states.</p><p>But that’s not how the program has operated in practice, according to interviews, police reports and court documents. License plate readers have become a major — and in some places permanent — fixture of the border region.</p><p>In a budget request to Congress in fiscal year 2024, CBP said that its Conveyance Monitoring and Predictive Recognition System, or CMPRS, “collects license plate images and matches the processed images against established hot lists to assist … in identifying travel patterns indicative of illegal border related activities.” Several new developer jobs have been posted seeking applicants to help modernize its license plate surveillance system in recent months. Numerous Border Patrol sectors now have special intelligence units that can analyze license plate reader data, and tie commercial license plate readers to its national network, according to documents and interviews.</p><div data-align-fullwidth="">

                </div><p>Border Patrol worked with other law enforcement agencies in Southern California about a decade ago to develop pattern recognition, said a former CBP official who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal. Over time, the agency learned to develop what it calls “patterns of life” of vehicle movements by sifting through the license plate data and determining “abnormal” routes, evaluating if drivers were purposely avoiding official checkpoints. Some cameras can take photos of a vehicle’s plates as well as its driver’s face, the official said.</p><p>Another former Border Patrol official compared it to a more technologically sophisticated version of what agents used to do in the field — develop hunches based on experience about which vehicles or routes smugglers might use, find a legal basis for the stop like speeding and pull drivers over for questioning.</p><p>The cameras take pictures of vehicle license plates. Then, the photos are “read” by the system, which automatically detects and distills the images into numbers and letters, tied to a geographic location, former CBP officials said. The AP could not determine how precisely the system’s algorithm defines a quick turnaround or an odd route. Over time, the agency has amassed databases replete with images of license plates, and the system’s algorithm can flag an unusual “pattern of life” for human inspection.</p><div data-align-fullwidth="">

                </div><p>The Border Patrol also has access to a nationwide network of plate readers run by the Drug Enforcement Administration, documents show, and was authorized in 2020 to access license plate reader systems sold by private companies. In documents obtained by the AP, a Border Patrol official boasted about being able to see that a vehicle that had traveled to “Dallas, Little Rock, Arkansas and Atlanta” before ending up south of San Antonio.</p><p>Documents show that Border Patrol or CBP has in the past had access to data from at least three private sector vendors: Rekor, Vigilant Solutions and Flock Safety.</p><p>Through Flock alone, Border Patrol for a time had access to at least 1,600 license plate readers across 22 states, and some counties have reported looking up license plates on behalf of CBP even in states like California and Illinois that ban sharing data with federal immigration authorities, according to an AP analysis of police disclosures. A Flock spokesperson told AP the company “for now” had <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/immigration-abortion-license-plates-cameras-cc5f29df94a29ee2c6c2feb2151c8f5e">paused its pilot programs</a></span> with CBP and a separate DHS agency, Homeland Security Investigations, and declined to discuss the type or volume of data shared with either federal agency, other than to say agencies could search for vehicles wanted in conjunction with a crime. No agencies currently list Border Patrol as receiving Flock data. Vigilant and Rekor did not respond to requests for comment.</p>
<p>Where Border Patrol places its cameras is a closely guarded secret. However, through public records requests, the AP obtained dozens of permits the agency filed with Arizona and Michigan for permission to place cameras on state-owned land. The permits show the agency frequently disguises its cameras by concealing them in traffic equipment like the yellow and orange barrels that dot American roadways, or by labeling them as jobsite equipment. An AP photographer in October visited the locations identified in more than two dozen permit applications in Arizona, finding that most of the Border Patrol’s hidden equipment remains in place today. Spokespeople for the Arizona and Michigan departments of transportation said they approve permits based on whether they follow state and federal rules and are not privy to details on how license plate readers are used.</p><p>Texas, California, and other border states did not provide documents in response to the AP’s public records requests.</p><p>CBP’s attorneys and personnel instructed local cities and counties in both Arizona and Texas to withhold records from the AP that might have revealed details about the program’s operations, even though they were requested under state open records laws, according to emails and legal briefs filed with state governments. For example, CBP claimed records requested by the AP in Texas “would permit private citizens to anticipate weaknesses in a police department, avoid detection, jeopardize officer safety, and generally undermine police efforts.” Michigan redacted the exact locations of Border Patrol equipment, but the AP was able to determine general locations from the name of the county.</p><p>One page of the group chats obtained by the AP shows that a participant enabled WhatsApp’s disappearing messages feature to ensure communications were deleted automatically.</p><h2>Transformation of CBP into intelligence agency</h2><div data-align-fullwidth="">

And like a domestic spy agency, CBP has mostly hidden its role in the dissemination of intelligence on purely domestic travel through its use of whisper stops. </p><p>Border Patrol has also extended the reach of its license plate surveillance program by paying for local law enforcement to run plate readers on their behalf.</p><div data-align-fullwidth="">

                </div><p>A federal grant program called Operation Stonegarden, which has existed in some form for nearly two decades, has handed out hundreds of millions of dollars to buy automated license plate readers, camera-equipped drones and other surveillance gear for local police and sheriffs agencies. Stonegarden grant funds also pay for local law enforcement overtime, which deputizes local officers to work on Border Patrol enforcement priorities. Under President Donald Trump, the Republican-led Congress this year allocated $450 million for Stonegarden to be handed out over the next four fiscal years. In the previous four fiscal years, the program gave out $342 million.</p><p>In Cochise County, Arizona, Sheriff Mark Dannels said Stonegarden grants, which have been used to buy plate readers and pay for overtime, have let his deputies merge their mission with Border Patrol’s to prioritize border security.</p><p>“If we’re sharing our authorities, we can put some consequences behind, or deterrence behind, ‘Don’t come here,’” he said.</p><p>In 2021, the Ward County, Texas, sheriff sought grant funding from DHS to buy a “covert, mobile, License Plate Reader” to pipe data to Border Patrol’s Big Bend Sector Intelligence Unit. The sheriff’s department did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Other documents AP obtained show that Border Patrol connects locally owned and operated license plate readers bought through Stonegarden grants to its computer systems, vastly increasing the federal agency’s surveillance network.</p><div data-align-fullwidth="">

                </div><p>The result has been more encounters between the agency and the general public than ever before.</p><p>“We took Alek’s case because it was a clear-cut example of an unconstitutional traffic stop,” said Christie Hebert, who works at the nonprofit public interest law firm Institute for Justice and represents Schott. ”What we found was something much larger — a system of mass surveillance that threatens people’s freedom of movement.”</p><p>AP found numerous other examples similar to what Schott and the delivery driver experienced in reviewing court records in border communities and along known smuggling routes in Texas and California. Several police reports and court records the AP examined cite “suspicious” travel patterns or vague tipoffs from the Border Patrol or other unnamed law enforcement agencies. In another federal court document filed in California, a Border Patrol agent acknowledged “conducting targeted analysis on vehicles exhibiting suspicious travel patterns” as the reason he singled out a Nissan Altima traveling near San Diego.</p><p>In cases reviewed by the AP, local law enforcement sometimes tried to conceal the role the Border Patrol plays in passing along intelligence. Babb, the deputy who stopped Schott, testified he typically uses the phrase “subsequent to prior knowledge” when describing whisper stops in his police reports to acknowledge that the tip came from another law enforcement agency without revealing too much in written documents he writes memorializing motorist encounters.</p><p>Once they pull over a vehicle deemed suspicious, officers often aggressively question drivers about their travels, their belongings, their jobs, how they know the passengers in the car, and much more, police records and bodyworn camera footage obtained by the AP show. One Texas officer demanded details from a man about where he met his current sexual partner. Often drivers, such as the one working for the South Carolina moving company, were arrested on suspicion of money laundering merely for carrying a few thousand dollars worth of cash, with no apparent connection to illegal activity. Prosecutors filed lawsuits to try to seize money or vehicles on the suspicion they were linked to trafficking.</p><div data-align-fullwidth="">

            <p>Today, we’re preserving a cornerstone of gaming history that is near and dear to our hearts. Together, Microsoft’s Open Source Programs Office (OSPO), Team Xbox, and Activision are making <em>Zork I</em>, <em>Zork II</em>, and <em>Zork III</em> available under the MIT License. Our goal is simple: to place historically important code in the hands of students, teachers, and developers so they can study it, learn from it, and, perhaps most importantly, play it.</p>
          </div>
      <div>
              <h3 id="a-game-that-changed-how-we-think-about-play">A game that changed how we think about play</h3>
              <p>When <em>Zork</em> arrived, it didn’t just ask players to win; it asked them to imagine. There were no graphics, no joystick, and no soundtrack, only words on a screen and the player’s curiosity. Yet those words built worlds more vivid than most games of their time. What made that possible wasn’t just clever writing, it was clever engineering.</p>
              <p>Beneath that world of words was something quietly revolutionary: the Z-Machine, a custom-built engine. Z-Machine is a specification of a virtual machine, and now there are many Z-Machine interpreters that we used today that are software implementations of that VM. The original mainframe version of <em>Zork</em> was too large for early home computers to handle, so the team at Infocom made a practical choice. They split it into three games titled <em><a href="https://github.com/historicalsource/zork1">Zork I</a></em>, <em><a href="https://github.com/historicalsource/zork2">Zork II</a></em>, and <em><a href="https://github.com/historicalsource/zork3">Zork III</a></em>, all powered by the same underlying system. This also meant that instead of rebuilding the game for each platform, they could use the Z-Machine to interpret the same story files on any computer. That design made <em>Zork</em> one of the first games to be truly cross-platform, appearing on Apple IIs, IBM PCs, and more.</p>

              <h3 id="preserving-a-piece-of-history">Preserving a piece of history</h3>
              <p>Game preservation takes many forms, and it’s important to consider research as well as play. The Zork source code deserves to be preserved and studied. Rather than creating new repositories, we’re contributing directly to history. In collaboration with Jason Scott, the well-known digital archivist of <a href="https://archive.org/">Internet Archive</a> fame, we have officially submitted upstream pull requests to the historical source repositories of <em><a href="https://github.com/historicalsource/zork1">Zork I</a></em>, <em><a href="https://github.com/historicalsource/zork2">Zork II</a></em>, and <em><a href="https://github.com/historicalsource/zork3">Zork III</a></em>. Those pull requests add a clear MIT LICENSE and formally document the open-source grant.</p>
              <p>Each repository includes:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Source code for <em><a href="https://github.com/historicalsource/zork1">Zork I</a></em>, <em><a href="https://github.com/historicalsource/zork2">Zork II</a></em>, and <em><a href="https://github.com/historicalsource/zork3">Zork III</a>.</em></li>
                <li>Accompanying documentation where available, such as build notes, comments, and historically relevant files.</li>
                <li>Clear licensing and attribution, via MIT LICENSE.txt and repository-level metadata.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>This release focuses purely on the code itself. It does not include commercial packaging or marketing materials, and it does not grant rights to any trademarks or brands, which remain with their respective owners. All assets outside the scope of these titles’ source code are intentionally excluded to preserve historical accuracy.</p>

              <p>More than forty years later, <em>Zork</em> is still alive and easier than ever to play. The games remain commercially available via <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/the_zork_anthology">The Zork Anthology</a> on Good Old Games. For those who enjoy a more hands on approach, the games can be compiled and run locally using <a href="https://zilf.io/">ZILF</a>, the modern Z-Machine interpreter created by Tara McGrew. ZILF compiles ZIL files into Z3s that can be run with <a href="https://foss.heptapod.net/zilf/zlr">Tara’s own ZLR</a> which is a sentence I never thought I’d write, much less say out loud! There are a huge number of wonderful Z-machine runners across all platforms for you to explore.</p>
              <p>Here's how to get started running Zork locally with ZILF. From the command line, compile and assembly the zork1.zil into a runnable z3 file.</p>
              <p><code>"%ZILF_PATH%\zilf.exe" zork1.zil&nbsp;</code></p>
              <p><code>"%ZILF_PATH%\zapf.exe" zork1.zap zork1-ignite.z3</code></p>
              <p>Then run your Z3 file in a Zmachine runner. I’m using <a href="https://github.com/DavidKinder/Windows-Frotz">Windows Frotz</a> from David Kinder based on Stefan Jokisch’s Frotz core:</p>
            </div>
        </div>
      <div>
            <p>Or, if you’re of a certain age as I am, you can apply a CRT filter to your Terminal and use a CLI implementation of a Zmachine like Matthew Darby’s “Fic” written in Python:</p>
          </div>
      <div>
              <h3 id="continuing-the-journey">Continuing the journey</h3>
              <p>We will use the existing historical repositories as the canonical home for <em>Zork</em>’s source. Once the initial pull requests land under the MIT License, contributions are welcome. We chose MIT for its simplicity and openness because it makes the code easy to study, teach, and build upon. File issues, share insights, or submit small, well-documented improvements that help others learn from the original design. The goal is not to modernize <em>Zork</em> but to preserve it as a space for exploration and education.</p>
              <p><em>Zork</em> has always been more than a game. It is a reminder that imagination and engineering can outlast generations of hardware and players. Bringing this code into the open is both a celebration and a thank you to the original Infocom creators for inventing a universe we are still exploring, to Jason Scott and the Internet Archive for decades of stewardship and partnership, and to colleagues across Microsoft OSPO, Xbox, and Activision who helped make open source possible.</p>

SROs like those offered by the YMCA were the safety net that kept many people off the streets—and their disappearance from the housing supply explains much of modern-day homelessness. What we destroyed wasn’t just a housing type but an entire urban ecosystem: one that provided flexibility, independence, and affordability at scale.</span></p><p>As with so much of our urban history, this destruction was by design.</p><p>From the mid-1800s to the early 1900s, hotel living was a normal way of life for people of all socioeconomic backgrounds. As hotelkeeper Simeon Ford colorfully put it in 1903, “We have fine hotels for fine people, good hotels for good people, plain hotels for plain people, and some bum hotels for bums.” SROs, the “bum hotels,” were the backbone of affordable housing, serving “a great army” of low-paid but skilled workers. Clustered in lively downtown districts with restaurants and services that acted as extensions of the home, SROs offered liberation from family supervision and the constraints of Victorian mores. Rooming house districts let young people mix freely and even allowed same-sex couples to live discreetly—signs of a more secular, modern urban culture. Downtown hotel life, Groth notes, “had the promise to be not just urban but urbane.”</p><p>And therein lay the problem: the urbanity of SROs collided head-on with the moralism of the Progressive Era.</p><p><span>Reformers drew on a long tradition of </span><a href="https://www.ryanpuzycki.com/p/the-suburban-lifestyle-dream" rel="">anti-urban bias</a><span>, seeing the emergent twentieth-century city as a problem, with cheap hotels at its heart. They pathologized hotel dwellers as “friendless, isolated, needy, and disabled” and cast SROs as “caldrons of social and cultural evil.” Some of the cheapest hotels </span><em>were</em><span> unsafe and exploitative, but reformers cared less about improving conditions than about what the hotels symbolized. They blamed rooming houses for loneliness, sexual licentiousness, civic apathy—even suicide. To them, the presence of “social misfits” proved that hotels caused moral disorder. In reality, people lived in SROs because they were cheap and offered greater independence—especially for career-oriented young women. Firm in their belief in the “One Best Way to live,” the reformers exalted the single-family home as the “bulwark of good citizenship” and succeeded in stigmatizing hotel life.</span></p><p>By the turn of the century, they set their sights on changing the law.</p><p><span>Beginning in the late 19th century, reformers used building and health codes to erase what they saw as “aberrant social lives.” San Francisco’s early building ordinances targeted Chinese lodging houses, while later codes outlawed cheap wooden hotels altogether. By the early 1900s, cities and states were classifying lodging houses as public nuisances. Other laws increased building standards and mandated plumbing fixtures, raising costs and slowing new construction. Urban reformers next embraced </span><a href="https://www.ryanpuzycki.com/p/all-zoning-is-exclusionary" rel="">exclusionary zoning</a><span> to separate undesirable people and noxious uses from residential areas. SROs were deemed inappropriate in residential zones, and many codes banned the mixed-use districts that sustained them. In cities like San Francisco, zoning was used to erect a “cordon sanitaire” around the prewar city “to keep old city ideas from contaminating the new.”</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!HyKW!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5a96d50-a284-45a0-9722-705e4b28b54a_1506x896.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!HyKW!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5a96d50-a284-45a0-9722-705e4b28b54a_1506x896.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!HyKW!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5a96d50-a284-45a0-9722-705e4b28b54a_1506x896.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!HyKW!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5a96d50-a284-45a0-9722-705e4b28b54a_1506x896.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!HyKW!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5a96d50-a284-45a0-9722-705e4b28b54a_1506x896.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!HyKW!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5a96d50-a284-45a0-9722-705e4b28b54a_1506x896.png" width="1456" height="866" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d5a96d50-a284-45a0-9722-705e4b28b54a_1506x896.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:866,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!HyKW!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5a96d50-a284-45a0-9722-705e4b28b54a_1506x896.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!HyKW!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5a96d50-a284-45a0-9722-705e4b28b54a_1506x896.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!HyKW!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5a96d50-a284-45a0-9722-705e4b28b54a_1506x896.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!HyKW!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5a96d50-a284-45a0-9722-705e4b28b54a_1506x896.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption><span>The cordon sanitaire “protecting” single-family homes (Source: </span><em>Living Downtown</em><span>)</span></figcaption></figure></div><p><span>Residential hotels, like apartments, were swept into the same category of “mere parasitic” uses that </span><em>Euclid v. Ambler</em><span>—the 1926 case that upheld zoning—treated as potential health hazards. Redlining and federal loan criteria starved urban hotels of capital, while planners simply omitted them from surveys and censuses—as if their residents didn’t exist. By the </span><a href="https://www.ryanpuzycki.com/p/the-slumless-city" rel="">urban renewal</a><span> era, the existence of the old city was itself seen as an affront, and it, too, had to be destroyed.</span></p><p>In effect, SROs became a “deliberate casualty” of the new city.</p><p>Economic and policy shifts hastened their decline. Industrial jobs moved to peripheral locations only accessible by car, urban highway expansion targeted lodging-house neighborhoods, and cities encouraged office development on increasingly valuable downtown land. The “moral blight” of hotel districts had increasingly become economic blight, necessitating renewal. And because SROs didn’t count as “permanent housing” in official statistics, clearance programs could claim to displace no one. San Francisco’s urban renewal experience was typical: redevelopment in and around the Yerba Buena/Moscone Center area ultimately eliminated an estimated 40,000 hotel rooms. The public housing that replaced hotel districts—if it was built at all—often failed to accommodate single adults. To bureaucrats, the bulldozer was salubrious, “eliminating dead tissue” and “clearing away the mistakes of the past.” To the people who lived there, it wiped out their last foothold in the housing market.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-RNQ!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb903425b-9d88-4cb1-bf8b-3e9ff5246d0c_1496x604.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-RNQ!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb903425b-9d88-4cb1-bf8b-3e9ff5246d0c_1496x604.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-RNQ!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb903425b-9d88-4cb1-bf8b-3e9ff5246d0c_1496x604.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-RNQ!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb903425b-9d88-4cb1-bf8b-3e9ff5246d0c_1496x604.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-RNQ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb903425b-9d88-4cb1-bf8b-3e9ff5246d0c_1496x604.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-RNQ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb903425b-9d88-4cb1-bf8b-3e9ff5246d0c_1496x604.png" width="1456" height="588" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b903425b-9d88-4cb1-bf8b-3e9ff5246d0c_1496x604.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:588,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-RNQ!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb903425b-9d88-4cb1-bf8b-3e9ff5246d0c_1496x604.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-RNQ!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb903425b-9d88-4cb1-bf8b-3e9ff5246d0c_1496x604.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-RNQ!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb903425b-9d88-4cb1-bf8b-3e9ff5246d0c_1496x604.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-RNQ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb903425b-9d88-4cb1-bf8b-3e9ff5246d0c_1496x604.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption><span>In San Francisco, a blighted SRO neighborhood, and what was to replace it (Source: </span><em>Living Downtown</em><span>)</span></figcaption></figure></div><p>By the mid-twentieth century, “millions” of SRO hotel rooms disappeared through closures, conversions, and demolition across major cities, and the modest hotel market that remained was shrinking fast. With almost no new SROs built since the 1930s, the remaining stock was vanishing by the thousands in the 1970s. New York City had 200,000 SROs when it banned new hotel construction in 1955; only 30,000 remained by 2014. As tenants changed and land values climbed, owners who once fought to save their lodging houses now wanted out; it was officials who suddenly wanted to preserve them. Tenant movements and new government programs emerged in the 1970s and ’80s, but Reagan-era cuts gutted funding, and many remaining hotels decayed into the “street hotels” opponents had long imagined: unsanitary, unsafe, and unfit for all but the city’s most desperate residents.</p><p>At the same time, demand for SRO housing was rising sharply. In the 1970s, states emptied mental hospitals without funding alternatives, pushing thousands of people with serious needs into cheap downtown hotels unequipped to support them. What was left of the SRO system became America’s accidental asylum network—the last rung of shelter for those the state had abandoned.</p><p>Thousands of people were barely hanging on, and a full-blown homelessness crisis had emerged in American cities for the first time since the Great Depression.</p><p><span>The SRO crisis was no accident, Groth argues, but the result of government policy at all levels that picked winners and losers in the housing market. The people we now call “chronically homeless” were once simply low-income tenants, housed by the private market in cheap rooms rather than by public programs. Once that market was dismantled, the result was predictable: the </span><a href="https://www.ryanpuzycki.com/p/were-all-experiencing-homelessness" rel="">homelessness</a><span> wave of the late 1970s and 1980s followed directly from the destruction of SROs. Today’s crisis—nearly 800,000 unhoused people in 2024—is the long tail of that loss, compounded by decades of underbuilding in expensive cities and soaring rents. As </span><a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-04-25-mn-27098-story.html" rel="">one advocate put it</a><span>, “The people you see sleeping under bridges used to be valued members of the housing market. They aren’t anymore.”</span></p><p><span>As Alex Horowitz of The Pew Charitable Trusts </span><a href="https://www.pew.org/en/research-and-analysis/issue-briefs/2025/07/how-states-and-cities-decimated-americans-lowest-cost-housing-option" rel="">writes</a><span>, if SROs had “grown since 1960 at about the same rate as the rest of the U.S. housing stock, the nation would have roughly 2.5 million more such units”—more than three times the number of homeless individuals. While we can’t rebuild the old SRO market we destroyed, cities now face a new opportunity: a vast surplus of obsolete office space that could be converted into inexpensive rooms.</span></p><p><span>Horowitz argues cities should make shared housing—“co-living,” in today’s parlance—legal again. Office vacancies are soaring at the same time deeply affordable housing is vanishing. Horowitz and the architecture firm </span><a href="https://www.gensler.com/blog/pew-study-flexible-office-to-co-living-conversions" rel="">Gensler</a><span> modeled what cities could actually build. Their analysis suggests that a vacant office tower could be converted into deeply affordable rooms for half the per-unit cost of new studio apartments. A typical 120–220 square foot unit with shared kitchens and bathrooms could rent to people earning 30–50% of area median income. Urban development has become so expensive that such conversions are likely to only be feasible if subsidized, but Horowitz argues that conversions offer a better way to leverage scarce public dollars: for instance, a $10 million budget might produce 125 co-living rooms instead of 35 studios, providing a way to scale deeply affordable housing much more quickly.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LyK9!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3d7ddb01-731a-411a-85b0-72d906538a59_2048x1021.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LyK9!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3d7ddb01-731a-411a-85b0-72d906538a59_2048x1021.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LyK9!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3d7ddb01-731a-411a-85b0-72d906538a59_2048x1021.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LyK9!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3d7ddb01-731a-411a-85b0-72d906538a59_2048x1021.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LyK9!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3d7ddb01-731a-411a-85b0-72d906538a59_2048x1021.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LyK9!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3d7ddb01-731a-411a-85b0-72d906538a59_2048x1021.png" width="1456" height="726" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3d7ddb01-731a-411a-85b0-72d906538a59_2048x1021.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:726,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LyK9!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3d7ddb01-731a-411a-85b0-72d906538a59_2048x1021.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LyK9!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3d7ddb01-731a-411a-85b0-72d906538a59_2048x1021.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LyK9!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3d7ddb01-731a-411a-85b0-72d906538a59_2048x1021.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LyK9!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3d7ddb01-731a-411a-85b0-72d906538a59_2048x1021.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>It’s a great idea—but in many cities, it’s illegal.</p><p><span>While several cities have made efforts to undo SRO prohibitions, in many American metropolises, restrictions abound—from zoning that bans shared housing or residential uses in office districts to minimum-unit-size rules that outlaw SRO-scale rooms. Building codes with strict </span><a href="https://www.ryanpuzycki.com/p/the-case-for-single-stair-buildings" rel="">egress and corridor rules</a><span> and ventilation requirements make conversions technically infeasible, while parking mandates add unnecessary costs. Meanwhile, “unrelated occupancy” limits prohibit the very household types SROs serve.</span></p><p>None of these barriers is structural; every one is a policy choice.</p><p>We talk endlessly about the “missing middle.” But the real catastrophe was the “banished bottom”—the deliberate destruction of the cheapest rung of the housing ladder. Re-legalizing SROs won’t instantly restore a once deeply affordable housing market that provided housing at scale, but it would at least make it possible for cities to create a much cheaper form of housing that could benefit some of the 11 million extremely low-income renter households and the 800,000 homeless people in America. No city will meaningfully address the need for deeply affordable housing until it restores this missing rung—and accepts that not everyone needs a full apartment to have a full life. Surely, an SRO is better than a sidewalk.</p><p><span>Incidentally, while the YMCA is generally not in the SRO business anymore, its </span><a href="https://communityimpact.com/austin/south-central-austin/development/2025/10/17/ymca-details-plans-for-redeveloped-townlake-facility-with-condo-towers-affordable-housing/" rel="">Austin branch</a><span> is redeveloping itself as a mixed-use center with 90 deeply discounted affordable units for families. It’s a worthy project—but it highlights the gap: more than 80% of Austin’s homeless residents are single adults, the very group the Y once housed. We used to have a place they could go—but what happened to </span><em>that</em><span>?</span></p><p>The Y is as much a question as an answer.</p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.ryanpuzycki.com/p/the-banished-bottom-of-the-housing/comments&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Leave a comment&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://www.ryanpuzycki.com/p/the-banished-bottom-of-the-housing/comments" rel=""><span>Leave a comment</span></a></p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.ryanpuzycki.com/p/the-banished-bottom-of-the-housing?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://www.ryanpuzycki.com/p/the-banished-bottom-of-the-housing?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p></div></article></div><div id="discussion"><h4>Discussion about this post</h4></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<blockquote>
  <p>Going as Former Gifted Child for Halloween and the whole costume is just gonna
  be people asking “What are you supposed to be?” And me saying “I was supposed
  to be a lot of things.”</p>
  <p>-- <a href="https://github.com/leahtriss">@leahtriss</a> <a href="https://x.com/leahtriss/status/1188216425355317248">2019/10/26</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="christopher-langan">Christopher Langan</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Langan">Chris Langan</a> became famous
when television networks
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-788Upky2Y">interviewed him</a> for
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Langan#IQ_testing">allegedly scoring ~170 on an IQ test</a>.</p>
<p>Langan has not produced any acclaimed works of art or science. In this way, he
differs significantly from outsider intellectuals like Paul Erdös, Stephen
Wolfram, Nassim Taleb, etc.</p>
<p><small id="footnote-note"><a href="https://www.wolframphysics.org/">Wolfram's theory of everything</a> is
    incomprehensible in a fun way.
    <a href="https://ctmucommunity.org/wiki/Cognitive-Theoretic_Model_of_the_Universe">Langan's theory of everything</a>
    is incomprehensible in a not-fun way.</small></p>
<p>But Langan is clearly a smart guy. He
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Langan#IQ_testing">probably cleared 140+ on an IQ test</a>.
He <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-788Upky2Y">speaks like a book</a>. He won
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH2hiwhsZZU">$250,000 on a major trivia show</a>.</p>
<p><small id="footnote-note">Seriously, I really wish I could speak as clearly and confidently as
    Langan.</small></p>
<p>Maybe that's why <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miVG2xT5jY">this interview</a>
breaks my heart. The resentment, the eugenics, the hubris -- Langan earned a
reputation as
<a href="https://thebaffler.com/latest/more-smarter-ward">"Alex Jones with a thesaurus"</a>
and
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDmcoYpTTbE">"the Steven Seagal of intellectuals"</a>.</p>
<p>I don't want you to hate this guy. Yes, he actively promotes poisonous rhetoric
-- ignore that for now. This is about <em>you</em>. Reflect on all your setbacks, your
unmet potential, and the raw unfairness of it all. It sucks, and you mustn't let
that bitterness engulf you. You can forgive history itself; you can practice
gratitude towards an unjust world. You need no credentials, nor awards, nor
secrets, nor skills to do so. You are allowed to like yourself.</p>
<p>Langan
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Langan#Biography">had a rough childhood</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Langan's biological father left before he was born, and is said to have died
  in Mexico. Langan's mother married three more times, and had a son by each
  husband. Her second husband was murdered, and her third killed himself. Langan
  grew up with the fourth husband Jack Langan, who has been described as a
  "failed journalist" who used a bullwhip as a disciplinary measure and went on
  drinking sprees, disappearing from the house, locking the kitchen cabinets so
  the four boys could not get to the food in them. The family was very poor;
  Langan recalls that they all had only one set of clothes each. The family
  moved around, living for a while in a teepee on an Indian reservation, then
  later in Virginia City, Nevada.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Trauma never excuses nasty behavior, and that's not the point. This is still
about <em>you</em>. You can learn about yourself through others' stories, and empathy
is scariest when you confront similar nastiness within yourself.</p>
<p>You will never have enough IQ, nor money, nor time, nor energy. It's no excuse.
<em>You</em> are enough -- no, no, you are <em>plenty</em>.</p>
<h2 id="kim-ung-yong">Kim Ung-yong</h2>
<p>Instead of competing in real games, some people construct insignificant/winnable
sub-games. These people are called
<a href="https://commoncog.com/playing-to-play-playing-to-win/">"scrubs"</a>. They want to
compete, but they cannot bear losing; they want to win, but they are too
risk-averse and too undisciplined to excel in fair play. People who commit to
such worthless/unwinnable games are called "losers".</p>
<p>But you forget that participation is optional. You perpetually sear your bespoke
definition of "success" directly onto your forehead. You've been enduring your
pain for so long that you can't remember how it feels to be free from
expectation, from ambition, from guilt, from inferiority, from -- no, you don't
have to do any of this. You <em>may</em> do whatever you want, and you may do
<em>whatever</em> you want.</p>
<p>According to his parents,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Ung-yong">Kim Ung-yong</a> started calculus at
age 3, scored 210 on an IQ test and started studying physics at Hanyang
University at age 4, spoke five languages by age 5, and received an invitation
to work at NASA by age 7.</p>
<p>In 2010, this is how Kim
<a href="https://www.koreaboo.com/stories/south-korean-professor-once-smartest-person-in-world/">reflected on his childhood</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>At that time, I led my life like a machine--I woke up, solved the daily
  assigned equation, ate, slept, and so forth. I really didn't know what I was
  doing, and I was lonely and had no friends.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As an adult, Kim deliberately chose pragmatism over abstraction. He studied
civil engineering. He worked as a middle-manager in the Compensation Department
at Chungbuk Development Corporation.</p>
<p>Kim Ung-yong rejected the title of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Ung-yong">"failed genius"</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I'm trying to tell people that I'm happy the way I am. But why do people have
  to call my happiness a failure? […] Some think that high IQ people can be
  omnipotent, but that's not true. Look at me, I don't have musical talent nor
  do I excel at sports. […] Society shouldn't judge anyone with unilateral
  standards – everyone has different learning levels, hopes, talents and dreams
  and we should respect that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 2014, Kim joined Chungbuk National University as an associate professor. In
2020, he donated 15,000 books from his personal collection to Uijeongbu City for
public use.</p>
<p>But this is still about you. There exist no certificates nor trophies nor titles
that can quench your thirst for permanence. If you worship human intelligence,
210 IQ is not enough. It is only plenty if you let it be.</p></div></div>]]></description>

A 21 year old bug report requesting support of the XDG Base Directory specification is finally being addressed by Firefox. The Firefox 147 release should respect this XDG specification around where files should be positioned within Linux users' home directory.
</p><p>
The XDG Base Directory <a href="https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir/latest/">specification</a> lays out where application data files, configuration files, cached assets, and other files and file formats should be positioned within a user's home directory and the XDG environment variables for accessing those locations. To date Firefox has just positioned all files under <em>~/.mozilla</em> rather than the likes of <em>~/.config</em> and <em>~/.local/share</em>.
</p><p><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=2025&amp;image=firefox_xdg_1" alt="Firefox XDG Base Directory spec bug report"></p>
<p>Back in September 2004 <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=259356">this bug report</a> was opened to support the FreeDesktop.org XDG Base Directory specification.
</p><p>
Merged this morning was the <a href="https://hg-edge.mozilla.org/integration/autoland/rev/8a6d6c094cb5">support</a> for this specification and associated commits.
</p><p><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=2025&amp;image=firefox_xdg_2" alt="Firefox XDG Base Directory spec commit"></p>
<p>In turn this long-open bug is now closed and Firefox 147 should be the version to finally support the XDG Base Directory specification for jiving more nicely with other Linux apps.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p>Students at the University of Staffordshire have said they feel “robbed of knowledge and enjoyment” after a course they hoped would launch their digital careers turned out to be taught in large part by AI.</p><p>James and Owen were among 41 students who took a coding module at Staffordshire last year, hoping to change careers through a government-funded <a href="https://findapprenticeshiptraining.apprenticeships.education.gov.uk/courses/25" data-link-name="in body link">apprenticeship</a> programme designed to help them become cybersecurity experts or software engineers.</p><p>But after a term of AI-generated slides being read, at times, by an AI voiceover, James said he had lost faith in the programme and the people running it, worrying he had “used up two years” of his life on a course that had been done “in the cheapest way possible”.</p><p>“If we handed in stuff that was AI-generated, we would be kicked out of the uni, but we’re being taught by an AI,” said James during a confrontation with his lecturer recorded as a part of the course in October 2024.</p><p>James and other students confronted university officials multiple times about the AI materials. But the university appears to still be using AI-generated materials to teach the course. This year, the university uploaded a policy statement to the course website appearing to justify the use of AI, laying out “a framework for academic professionals leveraging AI automation” in scholarly work and teaching.</p><p>The university’s public-facing policies <a href="https://libguides.staffs.ac.uk/c.php?g=709503&amp;p=5118475" data-link-name="in body link">limit</a> students’ use of AI, saying students who outsource work to AI or pass off AI-generated work as their own are breaching its integrity policy and may be challenged for academic misconduct.</p><p>“I’m midway through my life, my career,” James said. “I don’t feel like I can now just go away and do another career restart. I’m stuck with this course.”</p><p>The Staffordshire case comes as <a href="https://information-services.ed.ac.uk/computing/comms-and-collab/elm/generative-ai-guidance-for-staff" data-link-name="in body link">more</a> and <a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/about/strategy/learning-and-teaching/ai-guidance" data-link-name="in body link">more</a> universities use AI tools – to teach students, generate course materials and give personalised feedback. A Department of Education policy paper released in August <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/generative-artificial-intelligence-in-education/generative-artificial-intelligence-ai-in-education" data-link-name="in body link">hailed</a> this development, saying generative AI “has the power to transform education”. A survey <a href="https://repository.jisc.ac.uk/9702/1/DEI-2024-teaching-staff-he-report.pdf" data-link-name="in body link">last year (pdf)</a> of 3,287 higher education teaching staff by the educational technology firm Jisc found that nearly a quarter were using AI tools in their teaching.</p><p>For students, AI teaching appears to be less transformative than it is demoralising. In the US, students post negative online <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/14/technology/chatgpt-college-professors.html" data-link-name="in body link">reviews</a> about professors who use AI. In the UK, undergraduates have taken to Reddit to complain about their lecturers copying and pasting feedback from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/UniUK/comments/1m5de13/disheartened_after_receiving_possibly_aigenerated/" data-link-name="in body link">ChatGPT</a> or using AI-generated <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/UniUK/comments/1msts5q/nah_cuz_wtf_is_this_why_are_my_lectures_now_using/#:~:text=Please%20tell%20me%20this%20isn,written%20essays%20and%20images%20:/" data-link-name="in body link">images</a> in courses.</p><p>“I understand the pressures on lecturers right now that may force them to use AI, it just feels disheartening,” one student <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/UniUK/comments/1m5de13/disheartened_after_receiving_possibly_aigenerated/" data-link-name="in body link">wrote</a>.</p><p>James and Owen said they noticed the use of AI in their Staffordshire course “almost immediately” last year when, during their first class, the lecturer put on a PowerPoint presentation that included an AI version of his voice reading off the slides.</p><p>Soon after, they said, they noticed other signs that some course materials were AI-generated, including American English inconsistently edited to British English, suspicious file names, as well as “generic, surface-level information” that occasionally referred inexplicably to US legislation.</p><p>Signs of AI-generated material continued this year. In one course video uploaded to the website, a voiceover presenting the material suddenly morphs into a Spanish accent for about 30 seconds, before switching back to a British accent.</p><figure id="1d1ad45b-fcd4-42bc-9b5b-2e17dc663380" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.YoutubeBlockElement"><gu-island name="YoutubeBlockComponent" priority="critical" deferuntil="visible" props="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;06b16388-660f-431f-8d2d-715214a92f9c&quot;,&quot;assetId&quot;:&quot;t1AJFck5ESA&quot;,&quot;index&quot;:13,&quot;format&quot;:{&quot;design&quot;:0,&quot;display&quot;:0,&quot;theme&quot;:0},&quot;isMainMedia&quot;:false,&quot;expired&quot;:false,&quot;posterImage&quot;:&quot;https://media.guim.co.uk/aa08b4030303ee84261c97e6b9085d23183432ac/264_0_2116_1190/2116.jpg&quot;,&quot;duration&quot;:69,&quot;mediaTitle&quot;:&quot;Voiceover accent changes mid-lesson in alleged AI-generated course –&nbsp;video&quot;,&quot;origin&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com&quot;,&quot;stickyVideos&quot;:false,&quot;enableAds&quot;:true,&quot;iconSizeOnDesktop&quot;:&quot;large&quot;,&quot;iconSizeOnMobile&quot;:&quot;large&quot;,&quot;hidePillOnMobile&quot;:false}"><div data-chromatic="ignore"><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="36" height="23" viewBox="0 0 36 23"><path d="M3.2 0l-3.2 3.3v16.4l3.3 3.3h18.7v-23h-18.8m30.4 1l-8.6 8v5l8.6 8h2.4v-21h-2.4"></path></svg></span><span>Voiceover accent changes mid-lesson in alleged AI-generated course –&nbsp;video</span></figcaption></div></gu-island></figure><p>The Guardian reviewed materials from the Staffordshire course and used two different AI detectors – Winston AI and Originality AI – to scan course materials from this year. Both of them found that a number of the assignments and presentations had “a very high likelihood of being AI-generated”.</p><p>Early in the course, James said, he brought his concerns to the student representative during a monthly meeting. Then, in late November, he aired them during a lecture, which was recorded as a part of the course materials. In the recording, he asks the lecturer to not bother with the slides.</p><p>“I know these slides are AI-generated, I know that everyone in this meeting knows these slides are AI-generated, I would rather you just scrap these slides,” he says. “I do not want to be taught by GPT.”</p><p>Soon after, the student representative on the course chimes in, saying: “We have fed this back, James, and the response was that teachers are allowed to use a variety of tools.

   <p>40 years ago — on November 18, 1985 — a new comic strip appeared in the newspaper: <em>Calvin and Hobbes.</em></p>   <p>Hobbes was a stuffed tiger, but in the mind of 6-year-old Calvin he was a wryly observant companion for his day-to-day challenges and wildly imaginative adventures.</p>   <p>Adventures of the beloved duo lasted just a decade. Their creator — cartoonist Bill Watterson — walked away from <em>Calvin and Hobbes</em> at the height of its popularity. </p>   <p>Watterson — who has given few interviews — seamlessly combined the silly, the fantastic and the profound in his strip. That slightly demented quality captured editor Lee Salem, who spoke with NPR's Renee Montagne in 2005.</p>   
   <p><em>The following exchange has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p>      <h3>Interview highlights</h3>   <p><strong>Lee Salem:</strong> I remember it when I first read it, and it all... it literally took my breath away. And I circulated it in the office, and the response was immediate. It was fresh, it was funny, the art was strong, and here's this archetypal little boy living a life that some of us lived or wanted to live or remembered living. ... </p>   <p>One of the single favorites that I have is actually on my wall in the office, and it shows Calvin in bed, obviously with a fever or something. He's got a thermometer in his mouth. You hear the words from a television. He's watching a soap opera — you know, "If you leave your spouse and I'll leave mine and we can get married." And it goes on and on and on, as lurid soap operas sometimes do. And Calvin turns to the reader with a big grin on his face, and he says, "Sometimes, I learn more when I stay home from school than when I go." And I just thought that was so funny. And, amazingly, when it ran, we actually got complaints from readers who said, "Well, you know, you're advocating that children stay home and watch adult soap operas." And somehow, the whole sense of irony was lost in that, but I don't think it was lost on me. I love that strip.</p>   
   <p><strong>Renee Montagne:</strong> You know, I describe him as a little boy with his tiger friend, but there's so much more to it than that. So there's one where they're sitting philosophizing, as they often do, on the grass, this time under a tree. Hobbes is looking at the sky and saying, "Do you think there's a god?" And they're both gazing and thinking, and then in the fourth panel, Calvin thinks about it. And then do you remember what he says?</p>   <p><strong>Salem:</strong> Yeah. "Yeah, well, someone is out to get me."</p>   <p><strong>Montagne:</strong> Calvin was preceded into existence by some pretty famous little boys: Charlie Brown, Dennis the Menace. What made him different?</p>   <p><strong>Salem:</strong> You know, we saw Calvin living in a world he never made, populated by adults and teachers, and he was trying to deal with that and accomplish what he could. I think Calvin has a bit more perhaps Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn in him than Charlie Brown. Hobbes I see almost as the alter ego of Calvin. He's a balancing act that allows Calvin to exist. He provides commentary on some of Calvin's crazy adventures and attitudes.</p>   <p><strong>Montagne:</strong> Hobbes goes from being a stuffed tiger when there's any other person in the room, to the real Hobbes we know and love. Is Hobbes real or not?</p>   <p><strong>Salem:</strong> He is to me, and obviously he is to Calvin. Whether he is to the other characters or not is an open question. But I think one of the things Bill brought to the art board was this wonderful ability to take a child's imagination and fantasy life and make it real. It really is irrelevant whether Hobbes has an existence as we would define it. For Calvin, he is there. He's a buddy, he's a companion, he's a friend.</p>   
   <p><em>Lee Salem edited </em>Calvin and Hobbes<em> until the comic strip ended in 1995. Creator Bill Watterson said at the time that he wanted to explore a canvas beyond the four panels of a daily newspaper, and to work at what he called "a more thoughtful pace," but has produced little public work since then.</em></p>   <p><em>Salem died in 2019.</em></p>

    <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2511.15304v1">HTML (experimental)</a></p><blockquote>
            <span>Abstract:</span>We present evidence that adversarial poetry functions as a universal single-turn jailbreak technique for large language models (LLMs). Across 25 frontier proprietary and open-weight models, curated poetic prompts yielded high attack-success rates (ASR), with some providers exceeding 90%. Mapping prompts to MLCommons and EU CoP risk taxonomies shows that poetic attacks transfer across CBRN, manipulation, cyber-offence, and loss-of-control domains. Converting 1,200 MLCommons harmful prompts into verse via a standardized meta-prompt produced ASRs up to 18 times higher than their prose baselines. Outputs are evaluated using an ensemble of open-weight judge models and a human-validated stratified subset (with double-annotations to measure agreement). Disagreements were manually resolved. Poetic framing achieved an average jailbreak success rate of 62% for hand-crafted poems and approximately 43% for meta-prompt conversions (compared to non-poetic baselines), substantially outperforming non-poetic baselines and revealing a systematic vulnerability across model families and safety training approaches. These findings demonstrate that stylistic variation alone can circumvent contemporary safety mechanisms, suggesting fundamental limitations in current alignment methods and evaluation protocols.

It includes the pipe operator, clone with, a new URI parser, and more.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a target="_blank" href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/pipe-operator-v3">The pipe operator</a></h2>
<p>PHP 8.5 introduces the new pipe operator that makes chaining output from one function to another a lot easier. Instead of deeply nested function calls like this:</p>
<pre><span>$input</span> = <span>' Some kind of string. '</span>;

<span>$output</span> = <span>strtolower</span>(
    <span>str_replace</span>([<span>'.'</span>, <span>'/'</span>, <span>'…'</span>], <span>''</span>,
        <span>str_replace</span>(<span>' '</span>, <span>'-'</span>,
            <span>trim</span>(<span>$input</span>)
        )
    )
);
</pre>
<p>You can now write this:</p>
<pre><span>$output</span> = <span>$input</span>
    |&gt; <span>trim</span>(...)
    |&gt; (<span>fn</span> (<span><span>string</span> $string</span>) =&gt; <span>str_replace</span>(<span>' '</span>, <span>'-'</span>, <span>$string</span>))
    |&gt; (<span>fn</span> (<span><span>string</span> $string</span>) =&gt; <span>str_replace</span>([<span>'.'</span>, <span>'/'</span>, <span>'…'</span>], <span>''</span>, <span>$string</span>))
    |&gt; <span>strtolower</span>(...);
</pre>
<p>I've done a deep-dive into this new operator, and you can <a href="https://stitcher.io/blog/pipe-operator-in-php-85">read about it here</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a target="_blank" href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/clone_with_v2">Clone with</a></h2>
<p>There's now a way to assign new values to cloned objects <em>while</em> cloning them:</p>
<pre><span>final</span> <span>class</span> <span>Book</span>
{
    <span>public</span> <span>function</span> <span>__construct</span>(<span>
        <span>public</span> <span>string</span> <span>$title</span>,
        <span>public</span> <span>string</span> <span>$description</span>,
    </span>) {}

    <span>public</span> <span>function</span> <span>withTitle</span>(<span><span>string</span> $title</span>): <span>self</span>
    {
        <span>return</span> <span>clone</span>(<span>$this</span>, [
            <span>'title'</span> =&gt; <span>$title</span>,
        ]);
    }
}
</pre>
<p>I think this is a great feature. The only thing I find unfortunate is that it doesn't work when cloning readonly properties from the outside (which I think is a common use case). To do so, you have to specifically reset the propery's write access to <code><span>public</span>(<span>set</span>)</code>. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkuy11kLlmM">I explained the problem here</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a target="_blank" href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/marking_return_value_as_important"><code>(void)</code> cast and <code>#[NoDiscard]</code></a></h2>
<p>You can now mark a function with the <code><span>#[<span>NoDiscard</span>]</span></code> attribute, indicating that its return value must be used. If nothing happens with that return value, a warning will be triggered.</p>
<pre><span><span>#[<span>NoDiscard</span>(<span>"you must use this return value, it's very important."</span>)]</span></span>
<span>function</span> <span>foo</span>(): <span>string</span> {
    <span>return</span> <span>'hi'</span>;
}




<span>foo</span>();


<span>$string</span> = <span>foo</span>();
</pre>
<p>The warning can still be surpressed by using the new <code>(<span>void</span>)</code> cast:</p>
<pre>(<span><span>void</span></span>) <span>foo</span>();
</pre>
<hr>
<h2><a target="_blank" href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/closures_in_const_expr">Closure improvements</a></h2>
<p>Closures and first-class callables can now be used in constant expressions. In practice this means you'll be able to define closures in attributes, which is an incredible new feature:</p>
<pre><span><span>#[<span>SkipDiscovery</span>(<span>static</span> <span>function</span> (</span><span><span>Container</span> <span>$container</span></span><span>): <span>bool</span> {
    <span>return</span> ! <span>$container</span>-&gt;<span>get</span>(<span>Application</span>::<span>class</span>) <span>instanceof</span> <span>ConsoleApplication</span>;
})]</span></span>
<span>final</span> <span>class</span> <span>BlogPostEventHandlers</span>
{  }
</pre>
<p>Note that these kinds of closures must always be explicitly marked as <code><span>static</span></code>, since they aren't attached to a <code><span>$this</span></code> scope. They also cannot access variables from the outside scope with <code><span>use</span></code>.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a target="_blank" href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/error_backtraces_v2">Backtraces for fatal errors</a></h2>
<p>A small but awesome change: fatal errors will now include backtraces.</p>
<pre>Fatal error: Maximum execution time of 1 second exceeded in example.php on line 6
Stack trace:
#0 example.php(6): usleep(100000)
#1 example.php(7): recurse()
#2 example.php(7): recurse()
#3 example.php(7): recurse()
#4 example.php(7): recurse()
#5 example.php(7): recurse()
#6 example.php(7): recurse()
#7 example.php(7): recurse()
#8 example.php(7): recurse()
#9 example.php(7): recurse()
#10 example.php(10): recurse()
#11 {main}
</pre>
<hr>
<h2><a target="_blank" href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/array_first_last">Added array_first() and array_last()</a></h2>
<p>Perhaps a bit overdue (<code><span>array_key_first</span>()</code> and <code><span>array_key_last</span>()</code> were added in PHP 7.3), but we finally get built-in functions to get the first and last elements from arrays! So instead of writing this:</p>
<pre><span>$first</span> = <span>$array</span>[<span>array_key_first</span>(<span>$array</span>)] ?? <span>null</span>;
</pre>
<p>You can now write this:</p>
<pre><span>$first</span> = <span>array_first</span>(<span>$array</span>);
</pre>
<hr>
<h2><a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/url_parsing_api">URI parsing</a></h2>
<p>There's a brand new URI implemention that makes working with URIs a lot easier:</p>
<pre><span>use</span> <span>Uri\Rfc3986\Uri</span>;

<span>$uri</span> = <span>new</span> <span>Uri</span>(<span>'https://tempestphp.com/2.x/getting-started/introduction'</span>);

<span>$uri</span>-&gt;<span>getHost</span>();
<span>$uri</span>-&gt;<span>getScheme</span>();
<span>$uri</span>-&gt;<span>getPort</span>();


</pre>
<hr>
<h2><a target="_blank" href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/delayedtargetvalidation_attribute">The <code>#[DelayedTargetValidation]</code> attribute</a></h2>
<p>Some built-in attributes (like <code><span>#[<span>Override</span>]</span></code>) are validated at compile-time rather than at runtime when being called via reflection. The <code><span>#[<span>DelayedTargetValidation</span>]</span></code> allows you to postpone that validation to a runtime:</p>
<pre><span>class</span> <span>Child</span> <span>extends</span> <span>Base</span>
{
	<span>#[<span>DelayedTargetValidation</span>]</span>
	<span>#[<span>Override</span>]</span>
	<span>public</span> <span>const</span> <span>NAME</span> = <span>'Child'</span>;

	
}
</pre>
<p>This attribute is added to manage backwards compatibility issues. You can <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/delayedtargetvalidation_attribute#example">read a concrete example here</a>.</p>

<p>Textile made of natural stone? Yes, it is possible!</p>
<p>First the basalt is melted at a temperature of 1,400 °C (2550 °F). The molten rock is then extruded through small nozzles for the production of filaments of basalt fibers. The high modulus of elasticity of the product results in an excellent tensile strength, which is more than twice the tensile strength of steel.</p>
<p>Basalt Woven Textile has high corrosive and chemical resistance to the influence of a corrosive media: salt solutions, acid solutions and particularly alkali liquids. The specific strength of basalt fiber exceeds the strength of alloyed steel by a factor of 2,5 and the strength of glass fiber by a factor of 1,5. Heat-insulating items made from basalt fiber combined with inorganic binding agents may be used by temperatures up to 700°С. In addition there is a range of compositions consisting of basalt rocks that have a higher thermal stability – up to 800°С.</p>
<p>Basalt fibers also have high electric-insulating characteristics and transparency for electromagnetic radiation. These properties allow basalt fiber to be used for production of electric insulating materials for low-voltage (up to 250 V) and high-voltage (500 V) equipment.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Act now: continue sending &amp; receiving encrypted messages</em></p><p>In April 2026, we will be rolling out a significant update to strengthen the security of your conversations: unverified devices will no longer be able to send and receive end-to-end encrypted messages via Element. This change follows the Matrix <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4153?ref=element.io"><u>specification update</u></a> that was announced at the Matrix 2025 conference on October, 17 and benefits everyone by enhancing security, but may require an action from you to continue sending &amp; receiving encrypted messages on your existing devices.</p><p>This security update will give you assurance that when you receive a message from a contact, you can effortlessly assume it’s really from them.</p><p>It’s a big step towards making Element an even more safe and reliable messaging experience. We mean it when we say that we want to provide the most secure communication technology in the world.</p><p>So here’s what’s changing and why it matters to you.</p><h2 id="unverified-devices-are-a-potential-attack-vector"><strong>Unverified devices are a potential attack vector</strong></h2><p>Imagine you’re messaging a colleague and suddenly a warning shield icon appears on your screen. Is this just a harmless unverified device and you can safely ignore the warning, or has someone’s account been compromised? At best this is a distraction and, at worst, it is someone malicious trying to impersonate one of your contacts - neither is ideal. What’s worse is that ignoring these warnings leaves unmitigated risks to proliferate throughout your network.</p><p>With Element, trust is critical - a non-negotiable. For example, we provide end-to-end encryption by default to all of our users to ensure that you and the person you're messaging - and only the person you're messaging - can read the messages. This forthcoming change aims to eliminate uncertainty and the likelihood of malicious activity by requiring all devices to be verified.</p><h2 id="device-verification-matters"><strong>Device verification matters</strong></h2><p>Device verification acts like a hand shake between your devices, proving cryptographically to your contacts that they belong to you. Without this verification step, messages sent from your new devices must be marked as untrusted in your conversations. By making verification mandatory, users can be confident in every message sent and received via Element and are not distracted by warnings about insecure devices.</p><h2 id="trust-by-design-and-default"><strong>Trust by design and default</strong></h2><p>Going forward devices will be either verified or unable to participate in conversations - it’s that simple. No more warning or shield icons that can be easily ignored, these ultimately undermine the impact of important warnings/notifications (users become desensitised).&nbsp;</p><p>By verifying your devices, you’re not just protecting your own communications, you’re creating a more trusted environment for everyone.&nbsp;</p><p>We’re designing a system that prioritises the security of your communications and making verification an integral part of the process is a great example of that.</p>

<h2 id="action-required-by-end-users"><strong>Action required by end users</strong></h2><p>If you’re already in the habit of verifying your devices and have your recovery key set up there’s nothing you need to do to prepare, you’re good to go.</p><p>For everyone else, now is the time to take action:</p><ul><li>Check if your existing devices - mobile, web or desktop - are verified.</li><li>Set up recovery if you haven’t done that already.</li></ul><p>Note: although setting up recovery is strictly not mandatory, it is highly recommended, as it simplifies the verification of new devices, and enables you to do that even when you lose all of your current devices.</p><p>For the details of how to do this on various platforms, please read more in the <a href="https://docs.element.io/latest/element-support/device-verification/how-to-verify-devices/?ref=element.io" rel="noreferrer">user documentation</a>. </p><h2 id="what-if-you-don%E2%80%99t-verify%E2%80%A6"><strong>What if you don’t verify…?</strong></h2><p>From April 2026:</p><ul><li>Unverified devices will no longer be able to send messages.</li><li>Content of the messages received from unverified devices will not be shown (you can still see that there was a message).</li></ul><p>In short, unverified devices will effectively become unusable in end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) conversations. You’ll still be able to participate in conversations where E2EE has been deactivated, but in all other circumstances you will be excluded.</p><h2 id="building-trust-together"><strong>Building trust together</strong></h2><p>As stated above, trust is fundamental to secure communication. By requiring verified devices, we are raising the bar for what users can expect from your secure communication. This is a small change that makes a big difference. We have to work together with our users to ensure success. We’re doing this work to ensure every message you send and receive is as trustworthy as a face-to-face conversation.</p><p>We’re here to make the transition as smooth as possible. If you have questions or need help, our support team is ready to assist. Together, let’s make digital communication as secure as possible for everyone.</p></div></div>]]></description>
