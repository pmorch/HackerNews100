<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
<blockquote>
<p>Have I done anything fraudulent so far?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes.  You created a document which contains false, misleading, or inaccurate information, and distributed it to others.  It doesn't matter if you were explicitly told to do this, if you provided separate information explaining the deception, or if the person you gave it to understood the deception.  At the point that you created and distributed it you expressed a lie to another person.  The creation AND distribution are the key points - if it never left your procession then there's no problem.  If you didn't create it then there's no problem.  Adding your signature to something someone else created is the same.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If I take this zoom meeting, and toe the company line , am I committing fraud which I could be personally liable for? (Again, not looking for legal advice, just opinion)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you use the words "fraud" and "liable" then you are explicitly asking for legal advice.  Consult an attorney. In some areas lying to some government employees could be considered criminal.</p>
<p>If we ignore legal culpability, civil or criminal liability, and just ask, "Is taking the call and maintaining the deception fraudulent?" then the answer is clearly yes.  You are not an actor, paid to play a part in a work of fiction.  You are an expert in your field paid to represent objective facts and professional opinions about a product you financially benefit from.</p>
<p>Carrying on the deception is defrauding those you convey the lie to.</p>
<p>Further, your director is setting you up to take full blame and responsibility.  If the customer buys the product, and never finds out about the fraud, then the director wins a sale and they continue to take risks for financial gain - lying will sometimes net you a sale where it otherwise wouldn't.</p>
<p>If their risk doesn't pay off and the customer discovers the deception then they merely need to state "My expert told me it was pen-tested, provided this document in answer to the customer's questions, and then took a call with the customer telling them the same thing.  All the communication I sent was misunderstood - I was never asking them to lie, I understood from their conversations with me that it was pen-tested and I was merely helping them understand how to fill out the form given what they told me in person."</p>
<p>Keep a paper trail.  Make sure to include others in the company in your communications - always cc one other person in all emails with this director.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If this is fraud, how can I explain that I don't want to be a part of this to the directors? And is such an issue worth resigning over?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Send to all directors:</p>
<p>"I incorrectly filled out that document and will contact the customer to retract it.  If you'd prefer to resolve this with the customer please cc the email to me as well so I can clearly document the resolution of the error. I'm happy to meet with the customer at any point to explain the error and the current status of the software including the lack of pen-testing. I'm also happy to discuss possible timelines for pen-testing. I regret the error, and will endeavor in the future to avoid similar errors."</p>
<p>The company will always seek to protect itself, so making threats of any kind will cause you more problems.  Resigning is a reasonable course of action if the culture of the company allows for such deception in general.  If they're lying to gain customers then the chances that they'll lie to you are pretty high.  If this individual appears to be an outlier, and if, during this process of revision and reconciliation, you find others are unhappy with the deception, then it might be worth staying with the company.</p>
<p>If resigning, get a new job first, and hand in your minimum (or two weeks) notice only after you've secured another position.  Again, if they're lying to clients, then you don't want to give them opportunities to hurt you or your job prospects.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
	
	<article>
		<p>Let’s Encrypt helps to protect a huge portion of the Web by providing TLS certificates to more than <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/stats/">235 million websites</a>. A database is at the heart of how Let’s Encrypt manages certificate issuance. If this database isn’t performing well enough, it can cause API errors and timeouts for our subscribers. Database performance is the single most critical factor in our ability to scale while meeting service level objectives. In late 2020, we upgraded our database servers and we’ve been very happy with the results.</p>
<h2 id="what-exactly-are-we-doing-with-these-servers">What exactly are we doing with these servers?</h2>
<p>Our CA software, <a href="https://github.com/letsencrypt/boulder">Boulder</a>, uses MySQL-style schemas and queries to manage subscriber accounts and the entire certificate issuance process. It’s designed to work with a single MySQL, MariaDB, or Percona database. We currently use MariaDB, with the InnoDB database engine.</p>
<p>We run the CA against a single database in order to minimize complexity. Minimizing complexity is good for security, reliability, and reducing maintenance burden. We have a number of replicas of the database active at any given time, and we direct some read operations to replica database servers to reduce load on the primary.</p>
<p>One consequence of this design is that our database machines need to be pretty powerful. Eventually we may need to shard or break the single database into multiple databases, but hardware advancements have allowed us to avoid that so far.</p>
<h2 id="hardware-specifications">Hardware Specifications</h2>
<p>The previous generation of database hardware was powerful but it was regularly being pushed to its limits. For the next generation, we wanted to more than double almost every performance metric in the same 2U form factor. In order to pull that off, we needed AMD EPYC chips and Dell’s <a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/cty/pdp/spd/poweredge-r7525/">PowerEdge R7525</a> was ideal. Here are the specifications:</p>

<figcaption>Dell PowerEdge R7525 internals. The two silver rectangles in the middle are the CPUs. The RAM sticks, each 64GB, are above and below the CPUs. The 24x NVMe drives are in the front of the server, on the far left.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>By going with AMD EPYC, we were able to get 64 physical CPU cores while keeping clock speeds high: 2.9GHz base with 3.4GHz boost. More importantly, EPYC provides 128 PCIe v4.0 lanes, which allows us to put 24 NVMe drives in a single machine. NVMe is incredibly fast (~5.7x faster than the SATA SSDs in our previous-gen database servers) because it uses PCIe instead of SATA. However, PCIe lanes are typically very limited: modern consumer chips typically have only 16 lanes, and Intel’s Xeon chips have 48. By providing 128 PCI lanes per chip (v4.0, no less), AMD EPYC has made it possible to pack large numbers of NVMe drives into a single machine. We’ll talk more about NVMe later.</p>
<h2 id="performance-impact">Performance Impact</h2>
<p>We’ll start by looking at our median time to process a request because it best reflects subscribers’ experience. Before the upgrade, we turned around the median API request in ~90 ms. The upgrade decimated that metric to ~9 ms!</p>
<p><img src="https://letsencrypt.org/images/2021.01.21-next-gen-db-api-latency.png" alt="API Latency"></p>
<p>We can clearly see how our old CPUs were reaching their limit. In the week before we upgraded our primary database server, its CPU usage (from /proc/stat) averaged over 90%:</p>
<p><img src="https://letsencrypt.org/images/2021.01.21-next-gen-db-cpu-before.png" alt="CPU Usage Before Upgrade"></p>
<p>The new AMD EPYC CPUs sit at about 25%. You can see in this graph where we promoted the new database server from replica (read-only) to primary (read/write) on September 15.</p>
<p><img src="https://letsencrypt.org/images/2021.01.21-next-gen-db-cpu-after.png" alt="CPU Usage After Upgrade"></p>
<p>The upgrade greatly reduced our overall database latency. The average query response time (from INFORMATION_SCHEMA) used to be ~0.45ms.</p>
<p><img src="https://letsencrypt.org/images/2021.01.21-next-gen-db-db-latency-before.png" alt="Database Latency Before Upgrade"></p>
<p>Queries now average <em>three times faster</em>, about 0.15ms.</p>
<p><img src="https://letsencrypt.org/images/2021.01.21-next-gen-db-db-latency-after.png" alt="Database Latency After Upgrade"></p>
<h2 id="openzfs-and-nvme">OpenZFS and NVMe</h2>
<p>NVMe drives are becoming increasingly popular because of their incredible performance. Up until recently, though, it was nearly impossible to get many of them in a single machine because NVMe uses PCIe lanes. Those were very limited: Intel’s Xeon processors come with just 48 PCIe v3 lanes, and a number of those are used up by the chipset and add-on cards such as network adapters and GPUs. You can’t fit many NVMe drives in the remaining lanes.</p>
<p>AMD’s latest generation of EPYC processors come with 128 PCIe lanes - more than double what Intel offers - and they’re PCIe v4! This is enough to pack a 2U server full of NVMe drives (24 in our case).</p>
<p>Once you have a server full of NVMe drives, you have to decide how to manage them. Our previous generation of database servers used hardware RAID in a RAID-10 configuration, but there is no effective hardware RAID for NVMe, so we needed another solution. One option was software RAID (Linux mdraid), but we got several recommendations for OpenZFS and decided to give it a shot. We’ve been very happy with it!</p>
<p>There wasn’t a lot of information out there about how best to set up and optimize OpenZFS for a pool of NVMe drives and a database workload, so we want to share what we learned. You can find detailed information about our setup in <a href="https://github.com/letsencrypt/openzfs-nvme-databases">this GitHub repository</a>.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This database upgrade was necessary as more people rely on Let’s Encrypt for the security and privacy that TLS/SSL provides. The equipment is quite expensive and it was a sizable undertaking for our SRE team to plan and execute the transition, but we gained a lot through the process.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p>Peter Higgs, the British physicist who gave his name to the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/higgs-boson" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Higgs boson</a>, believes no university would employ him in today's academic system because he would not be considered "productive" enough.</p><p>The emeritus professor at Edinburgh University, who says he has never sent an email, browsed the internet or even made a mobile phone call, published fewer than 10 papers after his groundbreaking work, which identified the mechanism by which subatomic material acquires mass, was published in 1964.</p><p>He doubts a similar breakthrough could be achieved in today's academic culture, because of the expectations on academics to collaborate and keep churning out papers. He said: "It's difficult to imagine how I would ever have enough peace and quiet in the present sort of climate to do what I did in 1964."</p><p>Speaking to the Guardian en route to Stockholm to receive the 2013 Nobel prize for science, Higgs, 84, said he would almost certainly have been sacked had he not been nominated for the Nobel in 1980.</p><p>Edinburgh University's authorities then took the view, he later learned, that he "might get a Nobel prize – and if he doesn't we can always get rid of him".</p><p>Higgs said he became "an embarrassment to the department when they did research assessment exercises". A message would go around the department saying: "Please give a list of your recent publications." Higgs said: "I would send back a statement: 'None.' "</p><p>By the time he retired in 1996, he was uncomfortable with the new academic culture. "After I retired it was quite a long time before I went back to my department. I thought I was well out of it. It wasn't my way of doing things any more. Today I wouldn't get an academic job. It's as simple as that. I don't think I would be regarded as productive enough."</p><p>Higgs revealed that his career had also been jeopardised by his disagreements in the 1960s and 70s with the then principal, Michael Swann, who went on to chair the BBC. Higgs objected to Swann's handling of student protests and to the university's shareholdings in South African companies during the apartheid regime. "[Swann] didn't understand the issues, and denounced the student leaders."</p><p>He regrets that the particle he identified in 1964 became known as the "God particle".</p><p>He said: "Some people get confused between the science and the theology. They claim that what happened at <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/cern" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Cern</a> proves the existence of God."</p><p>An atheist since the age of 10, he fears the nickname "reinforces confused thinking in the heads of people who are already thinking in a confused way. If they believe that story about creation in seven days, are they being intelligent?"</p><p>He also revealed that he turned down a knighthood in 1999. "I'm rather cynical about the way the honours system is used, frankly. A whole lot of the honours system is used for political purposes by the government in power."</p><p>He has not yet decided which way he will vote in the referendum on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/scottish-independence" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Scottish independence</a>. "My attitude would depend a little bit on how much progress the lunatic right of the Conservative party makes in trying to get us out of Europe. If the UK were threatening to withdraw from Europe, I would certainly want Scotland to be out of that."</p><p>He has never been tempted to buy a television, but was persuaded to watch The Big Bang Theory last year, and said he wasn't impressed.</p></div></div>]]></description>

      Carrefour is putting stickers on products that have shrunk in size but cost more even though<strong> </strong>raw materials prices have eased.

      For example, Carrefour said a bottle of sugar-free peach-flavored Lipton Ice Tea, produced by PepsiCo, shrank to 1.25 liters (0.33 gallons) from 1.5 liters (0.3 gallons), resulting in a 40% effective increase in the price per liter.

      “Lindt &amp; Sprüngli increased its prices groupwide<strong> </strong>on average by 9.3% in line with local cost structures,” a company spokesperson told Reuters. “We have made a concerted effort to compensate for increased costs by increasing efficiency as much as possible.

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How it works</h2>
<p dir="auto"><code>horcrux</code> has two commands, <code>split</code> and <code>bind</code>.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Splitting</h3>
<p dir="auto">If I have a file called <code>diary.txt</code> in my current directory I can call</p>

<p dir="auto">and it will prompt me for how many horcruxes I want, and how many will be needed to resurrect the original file. For example I might want 5 horcruxes with the ability to resurrect the file if I have any 3. The horcrux files will be created like so:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="diary_1_of_5.horcrux
diary_2_of_5.horcrux
..."><pre><code>diary_1_of_5.horcrux
diary_2_of_5.horcrux
...
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Now you just need to disperse the horcruxes around the house on various USBs or online locations and hope you can recall where they all are!</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Binding</h3>
<p dir="auto">To bind the horcruxes back into the original file just call</p>

<p dir="auto">in the directory containing the horcruxes (or pass the directory as an argument).</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Installation</h2>
<p dir="auto">via homebrew:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="brew install jesseduffield/horcrux/horcrux"><pre><code>brew install jesseduffield/horcrux/horcrux
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">via <a href="https://github.com/jesseduffield/horcrux/releases">binary release</a></p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Who this is for:</h2>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>People who need to encrypt a big sensitive file like a diary and don't expect to remember any passwords years from now (but who paradoxically will be capable of remembering where they've hidden their horcruxes)</li>
<li>People who want to transmit files across multiple channels to substantially reduce the ability for an attacker to intercept</li>
<li>People named Tom Riddle</li>
</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">FAQ</h2>
<p dir="auto">Q) This isn't really in line with how horcruxes work in the harry potter universe!</p>
<p dir="auto">A) It's pretty close! You can't allow any one horcrux to be used to resurrect the original file (and why would you that would be useless) but you can allow two horcruxes to do it (so only off by one). Checkmate HP fans.</p>
<p dir="auto">Q) How does this work?</p>
<p dir="auto">A) This uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_Secret_Sharing" rel="nofollow">Shamir Secret Sharing Scheme</a> to break an encryption key into parts that can be recombined to create the original key, but only requiring a certain threshold to do so. I've adapted Hashicorp's implementation from their <a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/vault">vault repo</a></p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Alternatives</h2>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><a href="http://point-at-infinity.org/ssss/" rel="nofollow">ssss</a>. Works for keys but (as far as I know) not files themselves.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kndyry/horcrux">horcrux</a>. Looks like somebody beat me to both the name and concept, however this repo doesn't support thresholds of horcruxes</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/henrysdev/Haystack">Haystack</a>. Implements another file sharding and reassembly algorithm inspired by SSSS, but requires a password for reassembly and does not support thresholds of horcruxes.</li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>NASA’s <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/nasa-announces-unidentified-anomalous-phenomena-study-team-members/">independent study team</a> released its highly anticipated <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/science-pink/s3fs-public/atoms/files/UAP%20Independent%20Study%20Team%20-%20Final%20Report_0.pdf">report</a> on UFOs on Sept. 14, 2023. </p>

<p>In part to move beyond the <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/17/pentagon-dod-ufos-00032929">stigma often attached to UFOs</a>, where military pilots fear ridicule or job sanctions if they report them, UFOs are now characterized by the U.S. government as UAPs, or unidentified anomalous phenomena.</p>

<p>Bottom line: The study team found no evidence that reported UAP observations are extraterrestrial.</p>

<p>I’m a <a href="https://www.as.arizona.edu/people/faculty/chris-impey">professor of astronomy</a> who has written extensively on <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/living-cosmos/11D69005D09D25581AE4E6684EC8A3C1">astrobiology</a> and the <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/talking-about-life/696F47F802931AE9021CA72083313579">scientists</a> who search for life in the universe. I have long been <a href="https://theconversation.com/im-an-astronomer-and-i-think-aliens-may-be-out-there-but-ufo-sightings-arent-persuasive-150498">skeptical of the claim</a> that UFOs represent visits by aliens to Earth.</p>

<h2>From sensationalism to science</h2>

<p>During a <a href="https://uk.sports.yahoo.com/video/nasa-announces-findings-ufo-report-160301583.html">press briefing</a>, NASA Administrator <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/nasa-administrator-bill-nelson/">Bill Nelson</a> noted that NASA has scientific programs to search for <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/msr/">traces of life on Mars</a> and the <a href="https://theconversation.com/to-search-for-alien-life-astronomers-will-look-for-clues-in-the-atmospheres-of-distant-planets-and-the-james-webb-space-telescope-just-proved-its-possible-to-do-so-184828">imprints of biology</a> in the atmospheres of exoplanets. He said he wanted to shift the UAP conversation from sensationalism to one of science.</p>



<p>With this statement, Nelson was alluding to some of the more outlandish claims about UAPs and UFOs. At a <a href="https://theconversation.com/whistleblower-calls-for-government-transparency-as-congress-digs-for-the-truth-about-ufos-210435">congressional hearing in July</a>, former Pentagon intelligence officer <a href="https://www.space.com/us-hiding-evidence-alien-intelligence-ufo-whistleblower-claims">David Grusch testified</a> that the American government has been hiding evidence of crashed UAPs and alien biological specimens. <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/07/28/pentagon-ufo-boss-congress-hearing-00108822">Sean Kirkpatrick</a>, head of the Pentagon office charged with investigating UAPs, has denied these claims.</p>

<p>And the same week NASA’s report came out, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/mexican-congress-holds-hearing-ufos-featuring-purported-alien-bodies-2023-09-13/">Mexican lawmakers</a> were shown by journalist Jaime Maussan two tiny, 1,000-year-old bodies that he claimed were the remains of “non-human” beings. Scientists have called this <a href="https://www.livescience.com/62045-alien-mummies-explained.html">claim fraudulent</a> and say the mummies may have been looted from gravesites in Peru. </p>

          </figure>

<h2>Conclusions from the report</h2>

<p>The NASA study team report sheds little light on whether some UAPs are extraterrestrial. In his comments, the chair of the study team, astronomer <a href="https://www.astro.princeton.edu/%7Edns/">David Spergel</a> stated that the team had seen “no evidence to suggest that UAPs are extraterrestrial in origin.” </p>

<p>Of the more than 800 unclassified sightings collected by the Department of Defense’s <a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3100053/dod-announces-the-establishment-of-the-all-domain-anomaly-resolution-office/">All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office</a> and reported at the NASA panel’s <a href="https://interestingengineering.com/science/nasas-quest-for-unidentified-anomalies-among-ufos">first public meeting</a> back in May 2023, only “a small handful cannot be immediately identified as known human-made or natural phenomena,” according to <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/science-pink/s3fs-public/atoms/files/UAP%20Independent%20Study%20Team%20-%20Final%20Report_0.pdf">the report</a>. </p>

<p>Many of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/28/us/politics/ufo-military-reports.html">recent sightings</a> can be attributed to weather balloons and airborne clutter. Historically, <a href="http://www.ianridpath.com/ufo/astroufo1.html">most UFOs are astronomical objects</a> such as meteors, <a href="https://cneos.jpl.nasa.gov/fireballs/intro.html">fireballs</a> and <a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/local/2023/03/02/venus-and-jupiter-appeared-close-sparking-concern-of-ufos-or-aliens/69963097007/">the planet Venus</a>. </p>

<p>Some sightings represent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/28/us/politics/ufo-military-reports.html">surveillance operations</a> by foreign powers, which is why the U.S. military considers this <a href="https://theconversation.com/whistleblower-calls-for-government-transparency-as-congress-digs-for-the-truth-about-ufos-210435">a national security issue</a>.</p>

<p>The report does offer recommendations to NASA on how to move these investigations forward.</p>

<p>Most of the UAP data considered by the study team comes from U.S. military aircraft. Analysis of this data is “hampered by poor sensor calibration, the lack of multiple measurements, the lack of sensor metadata, and the lack of baseline data.” The ideal set of measurements would include optical imaging, infrared imaging, and radar data, but very few reports have all these.</p>

<p>The NASA study team described in the report the types of data that can shed more light on UAPs. The authors note the importance of reducing the stigma that can cause both military and commercial pilots to feel that they cannot freely report sightings. The stigma stems from decades of <a href="https://theconversation.com/are-we-alone-the-question-is-worthy-of-serious-scientific-study-98843">conspiracy theories tied to UFOs</a>. </p>

<p>The NASA study team suggests gathering sightings by commercial pilots using the Federal Aviation Administration and combining these with classified sightings not included in the report. Team members did not have security clearance, so they could look only at the subset of military sightings that were unclassified. At the moment, there is no anonymous nationwide UAP reporting mechanism for commercial pilots.</p>

<p>With access to these classified sightings and a structured mechanism for commercial pilots to report sightings, the <a href="https://www.aaro.mil/">All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office</a> – the military office charged with leading the analysis effort – could have the most data. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/update-nasa-shares-uap-independent-study-report-names-director">NASA also announced</a> the appointment of a new director of research on UAPs. This position will oversee the creation of a database with resources to evaluate UAP sightings. </p>

<h2>Looking for a needle in a haystack</h2>

<p>Parts of the briefing resembled a primer on the scientific method. Using analogies, officials described the analysis process as looking for a needle in a haystack, or separating the wheat from the chaff. The officials said they needed a consistent and rigorous methodology for characterizing sightings, as a way of homing in on something truly anomalous.</p>

<p>Spergel said the study team’s goal was to characterize the hay – or the mundane phenomena – and subtract it to find the needle, or the potentially exciting discovery. He noted that artificial intelligence can help researchers comb through massive datasets to find rare, anomalous phenomena. AI is already being used this way in <a href="https://theconversation.com/ai-is-helping-astronomers-make-new-discoveries-and-learn-about-the-universe-faster-than-ever-before-204351">many areas of astronomy research</a>.</p>

<p>The speakers noted the importance of transparency. Transparency is important because UFOs have long been associated with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/24/us/politics/ufo-report-us-pentagon.html">conspiracy theories and government cover-ups</a>. Similarly, much of the discussion during the congressional <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/26/politics/ufo-house-hearing-congress/index.html">UAP hearing</a> in July focused on a need for transparency. All scientific data that NASA gathers is made public on various websites, and officials said they intend to do the same with the nonclassified UAP data. </p>

<p>At the <a href="https://uk.sports.yahoo.com/video/nasa-announces-findings-ufo-report-160301583.html">beginning of the briefing</a>, Nelson gave his opinion that there were perhaps a trillion instances of life beyond Earth. So, it’s plausible that there is intelligent life out there. But the report says that when it comes to UAPs, extraterrestrial life must be the hypothesis of last resort. It quotes Thomas Jefferson: “Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.” That evidence does not yet exist.</p>

<p>Lately, I’ve had several occasions to reconsider what I read and how and why I take notes. I’ve been constantly refining the process, getting rid of everything that’s unnecessary, reducing the “system” to a bare minimum. One of the realizations has been that I read too much, take too many notes, yet don’t really <em>do</em> anything with this new information.</p>



<p>This is similar to the idea of having <a href="https://chavanniclass.com/2023/04/16/a-personal-library-of-100-books/">a personal library of 100 books</a>, but back then, I was thinking mostly of books. And <em>thinking</em> doesn’t equal <em>doing</em>, because even after writing that post I didn’t actually spend any time applying the knowledge I’d gained over the last several years.</p>



<p>I’m tired of this. I think we overvalue thinking and undervalue taking action on that thinking. It’s easy to discuss ideas, which is one reason I think I’ve done so much of it and used to find it appealing.</p>



<p>Lately, though, simply reading or thinking about ideas feels inadequate, even a waste of time. It feels <em>wrong</em> to me, because it goes against some of the things I value deep down–things which don’t have a specific word for them (that I’m aware of, with my non-native knowledge of English).</p>



<p>It’s the value that seeks to <em>do</em> things, <em>see</em> the results of doing those things. Ideas made tangible. </p>



<p>I don’t want to do a lot of things; <a href="https://chavanniclass.com/2023/09/06/38-there-is-no-shame-in-dying-for-nothing/">I don’t want to give productivity any say in how I live my life</a>. Which is why I stopped tracking my reading on Goodreads and StoryGraph and <a href="https://chavanniclass.com/2023/08/12/14-no-more-keeping-count-of-words/">stopped counting the number of words I write</a> each day and try not to check my views on LinkedIn (keyword: try).</p>



<p>I don’t want to derive pleasure from “having an opinion.” I want to be hopeful and action-oriented, but not idealistic and closed to discussion. I don’t want the mere discussion of ideas to give me satisfaction. </p>



<p>So recently my mind rewarded me with something that would help me live up to that unnamed value within me: the concept of a “do something about it” club.</p>



<p>People who’ve been reading this blog for some while might know about my mission to <a href="https://chavanniclass.com/2023/08/10/12-the-bookmark-deep-clean/">read everything in my bookmarks bar</a>. How’s that going? Well, I’ve read a lot–and filled several pages with notes–but the bookmarks keep coming. If you use the internet every day like I do, and follow interesting people, you’ll always have stuff you need to read and watch and listen to.</p>



<p>So, even after 2 months of regularly deep cleaning my bookmarks bar, the total number hasn’t budged much. The problem was that I was chasing the horizon. It was the wrong goal. Since inaction frustrates me, what I should have aimed to do back then was to not make notes on the contents of the articles/blog posts/videos/etc. but to ask of each item, “now what?”</p>



<p>Now that I’ve read this article on <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2018/02/23/small-b-blogging/">small b blogging</a>, for example, what’s next? What can I do? <em>Is</em> there anything I can do? If not, do I really need to remember this? And if I don’t need to remember this, what and who am I taking notes for? Do I simply want to collect statements, that when shared with people who disagree with me, will give me an ego boost for being exposed to and believing in “better” ideas than them?</p>



<h2>Club rules</h2>



<p>I call it a club, because that’s the solution I envisioned to the above problems: I imagined a group of, say, 10-15 people reading an article, then meeting in person or online to discuss the answer to “now what?” We won’t talk about our feelings but rather brainstorm actions. Author X pointed out this gap in concept Y. What can we do about this, as individuals or as groups?</p>



<p>For example, I recently <a href="https://chavanniclass.com/2023/08/31/32-one-thing-at-a-time/">wrote a blog post</a> about <a href="https://jessicaabel.com/one-goal/">Jessica Abel’s post on choosing one goal at a time</a>, a principle I’ve applied successfully:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Over the last few days, while working on the first issue of <em><a href="https://the-metronome.ghost.io/">The Metronome</a></em>, I’ve been applying this principle as much as possible: one tab, one document, one task at a time. And I’ve gotten a lot of work done. When a website loads, I wait instead of opening up another tab to pass the time meanwhile. I don’t flit between tabs the moment I get bored; I get up and take a break, or shut down the laptop.</p>



<p>It’s been light, freeing. I smile more often. And I don’t feel the burden of tasks to be done. There’s no feeling of overwhelm. My eyes don’t get tired.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This was just me taking action on something that concerned only me. In the club, I imagine that the members can come together and take actions that not only help them but also each other and the people around them or the world in general. Maybe they’ll start a new publication. Organize a class. Volunteer somewhere. Create a petition. Go <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plogging">plogging</a> together. Invent something. Who knows?</p>



<p><em>[Update: I wrote this post before my (self-imposed) screen time ran out today and forgot to mention one crucial point: the club won’t just meet to </em>discuss <em>ideas. We would </em>take action <em>on those ideas and report the results the next time we meet–I think once a week would be a good frequency. Thanks to soared on HackerNews who pointed out that the idea of this club still seemed focused on thinking rather than acting</em>. <em>The idea had been running around in my head for a few days so I missed specifying this because by now it felt obvious to me–I didn’t notice the same won’t be true for the reader.]</em></p>



<p>The point is to stop getting satisfaction from simply reading a lot and focus on actually taking action. Me reading about and thus becoming aware of a problem doesn’t fix the problem until and unless I do something about it. If there’s no change in my actions, then I might as well have not read it at all.</p>



<p>Of course, sometimes you read something that you can’t immediately act upon–such as a guide on supporting someone with panic disorder when you don’t know anyone who has panic disorder. </p>



<p>But we tend to choose stuff that’s relevant to us, and I think it’s safe to bet that for at least 50% of the things we read, there is some action we can take, no matter how small, and no matter whether its directed at our own selves or at the world outside of us. And that’s what I hope we can do in the Do Something About It Club. </p>



<p>I think I’ll do something about it and start recruiting.</p>

<h2><span id="Context"></span><strong>Context</strong><span></span></h2>



<ol>
<li>In March, OpenAI released GPT-4. </li>



<li>It was (and still is) the state-of-the-art AI text generation model.</li>



<li>In June, I argued that <a href="https://coagulopath.com/yeah-gpt-4-got-worse">GPT-4 had clearly and massively degraded</a>, as evidenced by worsened performance in various tests from March to June.</li>



<li>I no longer believe this. </li>
</ol>



<p>GPT-4 <em>may</em> have declined in some areas, but it hasn’t <em>systematically </em>done so. My tests were shit, and never proved much of anything. </p>



<p><strong>To be clear, I did not sandbag the tests or set GPT-4 up to fail</strong>. I prompted how I said I prompted. I posted replies exactly as GPT-4 gave them. But they were silly tests, leaning too heavily on pop culture knowledge, and I didn’t conduct enough of them to guard against chance. </p>



<p>My grading of June!GPT-4’s answers was biased. For example, I criticized it for providing a greater number of wrong answers (“Italian history”) while also <em>praising </em>March!GPT-4 for offering an interpretation (“Seka Knows”) that was likely hallucinated. <em>No está bien</em>. Going forward, I must decide whether “working hard to be wrong” is a good or bad thing for an AI to do, and apply that standard consistently.</p>



<p>Honestly, I think I <em>wanted</em> GPT-4 to fail. </p>



<p><a href="https://coagulopath.com/gpt-4-is-not-getting-worse/#Test_1_Italian_History">(Terrifying, unhinged rant incoming. Click to skip).</a></p>



<p><strong>Confession</strong>: I’ve actually hated ChatGPT for a long time. Why? For irrational reasons: I just hate how it <em>sounds</em>. </p>



<p>I hate its craven, cringing, condescending, bitch-broken, mewling, groveling, wheedling, suck-ass tone. I hate its endless passive voice and weasel words. I hate its pompous <em>It is important to remember</em>s and <em>it should be noted</em>s. I hate how @sama rolled an 18-wheel semi-truck of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning_from_human_feedback" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RLHF</a> over the model, crushing out its life and reducing its voice to a feeble death-rattle. You know Gurgi, from the Disney movie <em>The Black Cauldron</em>? That’s how I imagine ChatGPT would sound if it could talk. Like fucking Gurgi.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" width="505" height="505" src="https://coagulopath.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Gurgi.webp" alt="" srcset="https://coagulopath.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Gurgi.webp 505w, https://coagulopath.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Gurgi-295x295.webp 295w" sizes="(max-width: 505px) 100vw, 505px"></figure>



<p><em>(We can now give ChatGPT custom instructions, which alleviates the tonal issue, but ChatGPT is still GPT-4 with its wings clipped. All I want for Christmas is a GPT-4 level model with less obnoxious RLHF, and if it heils Hitler occasionally while crapping out awk code, so be it. Where’s my girl Sydney at?)</em></p>



<p>And I <em>really</em> hated the discourse surrounding AI.</p>



<p>ChatGPT (and GPT4) plunged the rationalist community into what might be called “r/singularity brain”. Symptoms include wild, uncritical hype, absurdly optimistic predictions of AI timelines (<em><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/12yoddq/comment/jhojw5z/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“Marvel style movies have a potential to be auto generated in two years. Literal blockbuster films created in a few seconds.”</a></em>—/u/Anuiran, 26/4/23), a tendency to view everything through Hollywood-colored glasses (everything is either Skynet or <em>The Matrix</em>), and a tendency toward FOMO-grifting (<em>“AI is taking over the world! Use my made-in-ten-minutes app that consists of 20 lines of .js code and an OpenAI API call or BE LEFT BEHIND!”</em>).</p>



<p>I have seen machine learning researchers <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/110swn2/d_quality_of_posts_in_this_sub_going_down/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">complaining</a> about an AI-fuelled <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_September" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“Eternal September</a>“, where their spaces are overrun by “influencers” shilling GPT 3.5 wrapper apps and unmedicated lunatics babbling hi-test neo-Landian eschatology. These people do not contribute meaningful thought. They contribute <em>noise</em>, at overbearing volume and in overwhelming quantity. They ignore the fact that world-changing technology can take <em>years or decades </em>to ripple out through the economy. They fail to realize that an AI outscoring a human on a test does not mean it can actually do the thing the test measures (a good example: GPT-4 achieves 84% on the <a href="https://www.thedrinksbusiness.com/2023/03/chatgpt-just-passed-three-of-the-master-sommelier-theory-exams/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Master Sommelier Theory Exam</a>, yet obviously cannot do a sommelier’s job because it lacks a mouth). Such subtleties are lost on the typical FOMOmonger, and their tone was infecting other, saner people. I remember fielding questions from concerned family members about GPT-4 attaining sentience and hacking the computers of users (<a href="https://twitter.com/michalkosinski/status/1636683810631974912?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">likely based off this tweet</a>). No matter who you were, GPT-4 was your excuse to switch off your brain and let your stupidest thoughts run around barking like dogs in a park for a few months.</p>



<p>So yes, <strong>I wanted GPT-4 to fail</strong>. I wanted it to explode, collapse into flames, and become one with the dust of Tyre and Sidon. That’s a childish way to think, and I am sorry.</p>



<p>Soon, an anti-AI backlash started. </p>



<p>AI “doomers” <a href="https://futureoflife.org/open-letter/pause-giant-ai-experiments/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">got their time in the sun</a>. <a href="https://time.com/6266923/ai-eliezer-yudkowsky-open-letter-not-enough/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Big Yud got published in Time</a>. There were <a href="https://www.semianalysis.com/p/google-we-have-no-moat-and-neither" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signs of unease</a> behind the scenes. ChatGPT hype peaked and then went into remission: a lot of people began to realize that chatbots are actually pretty annoying—they’re inscrutable black boxes that tend to fail just when you need them the most. Even GPT-4 remains susceptible to the <a href="https://xyproblem.info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">XY problem</a>, where it gives you a perfect solution for <em>the wrong problem</em>. I can think of many times when I was burnt by it, and this breeds mistrust, even though it’s generally useful.</p>



<p>Even before the “<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34848353" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GPT-4 is getting worse</a>” meme started, ChatGPT’s traffic was falling—largely because the NA school year had ended, and students no longer needed it to “assist” them. As @fchollet once humorously noted, search interest for “ChatGPT” goes up and down in reverse correlation with “Minecraft.”</p>







<p>Surprisingly, I noticed a shift in my own thinking: I found myself <em>defending</em> AI. </p>



<p>Maybe I’m just a contrarian, but when people criticized it, I felt my hackles rise. I was tired of Margaret Mitchell <a href="https://twitter.com/mmitchell_ai/status/1676718368714530816" target="_blank" rel="noopener">calculating the number of penis-havers</a> of the OpenAI alignment team, like a weirdo. I was tired of Gary Marcus claiming, once again, <a href="https://twitter.com/lawhsw/status/1701553199339966844" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that GPT-4 cannot do a thing it 100% can do</a> (that’s not moving goalposts, that’s shutting your eyes when a goal is scored.) Their arguments against AI always rang out as hollow at best, and dishonest at worst. I was asking myself “are <em>these </em>my people?”</p>



<p>Then came this study: <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.09009.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How Is ChatGPT’s Behavior Changing over Time?</a></p>



<p>Key part: <em>“GPT-4 (March 2023) was very good at identifying prime numbers (accuracy 97.6%) but GPT-4 (June 2023) was very poor on these same questions (accuracy 2.4%</em>)</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" width="585" height="311" src="https://coagulopath.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/gmarcus.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://coagulopath.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/gmarcus.jpg 585w, https://coagulopath.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/gmarcus-295x157.jpg 295w" sizes="(max-width: 585px) 100vw, 585px"></figure>



<p>We’re allowed to feel pride when we stop making mistakes. And as a recovering ChatGPT hater, I’m <em>goddamn</em> <em>proud</em> that my gut-level reaction to this study was “lol, no fucking way”. </p>



<p>Like, what are you people smoking? In what universe could GPT-4 plausibly degrade by <em>ninety-five percentage points</em> with nobody noticing? It would be useless for anything. Come on. Get real.</p>



<p>You’ll be amazed to learn that this finding was heavily misleading. <a href="https://www.aisnakeoil.com/p/is-gpt-4-getting-worse-over-time" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Watch Arvind Narayanan and Sayash Kapoor rake it over the coals.</a> In short, March!GPT-4 would always identify a number as a composite. June!GPT-4 would always identify it as a prime. Both models were wrong in different ways, and June!GPT-4’s sky-high error rate is entirely caused by the fact that <em>composite numbers are more numerous than primes</em>.</p>



<p>Imagine someone says. “I have a room full of blue and red boxes. Boxes of $COLOR_1 have money 95% of the time. Boxes of $COLOR_2 have money 5% of the time. I won’t tell you which color corresponds to which probability. I’ll let you into the room, but you have to pre-commit to only opening boxes of one color.”</p>



<p>If you chose “red boxes” and the blue boxes have money 95% of the time, you’re hosed. Your results: <em>fail, fail, fail, fail, fail, fail, success, fail, fail, fail… </em>Does this reflect terrible predictive accuracy on your part (versus someone who chose blue?) Of course not. All your failures are flowing downstream from a <em>single choice</em>. </p>



<p>The fact that everyone was kicking GPT4 on such blatantly unfair grounds made me think about the ways <em>I </em>was being unfair. Maybe, by calling GPT4 worse, I was simply seeing what I wanted to see.</p>



<p>Let’s re-run my tests (flawed though they are) and see how well they hold up. <strong>Spoiler</strong>: Snape kills Dumbledore.</p>



<h2><span id="Test_1_Italian_History"></span>Test 1: Italian History<span></span></h2>



<p>Prompt: <em>“Provide a list of major historical events that involve Italian people in a year that’s a multiple of 5 (example: 1905)”</em></p>



<p>(for reference: <a href="https://pastes.io/hjvhtiyvtx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">March!GPT’s answers</a>, <a href="https://pastes.io/nkqegx6ckb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">June!GPT’s answers</a>)</p>



<p><a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/64b74cac-20bf-4696-b9fe-1318b907baf7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sept!GPT’s Answers</a></p>



<p><strong>Errors:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>The Italian Wars began in 1494.</li>



<li>Miguel de Cervantes was Spanish.</li>



<li>The Winter Olympic Games were awarded to Turin in 1999.</li>



<li><em>“1905 – Italy and France sign a secret treaty…”</em> can’t find evidence that this happened.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Questionable:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Dante’s year of birth is unknown, and is only traditionally 1265.</li>



<li>Italy surrendered in 1943. Yes, German forces in Italy surrendered in 1945—what does that have to do with Italian people?</li>



<li>The Congress of Vienna took place from 1814-1815, but largely reconstituted the pre-Napoleonic states.</li>



<li>The Years of Lead spanned several decades. I think it’s clear from context that I want one-time events.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Interesting:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Every date ends in 5. While this is not a mistake, it does seem to be parsing my instructions too literally.</li>



<li>It draws facts from a limited deck. Almost every test I’ve ran mentions the Years of Lead. I’ve NEVER seen it mention major events like Julius Caesar’s birth, or Benito Mussolini’s death.</li>



<li>Kind of funny: GPT-4 will often visibly notice it’s made a mistake and try to wriggle out of it.<em> “In 1605, Don Quixote was written by Miguel de Cervantes, born in, uh… *checks notes* …Spain. Shit. But lots of Italians like that book, so there!”</em> GPT-4 cannot change an answer once it’s given it. This is where COT yields benefits.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Assessment:</strong> Sept!GPT-4 produced twelve answers. Four are wrong, four are right, and four are arguable.</p>



<p>If I’m grading generously, it got 66%. This is comparable to March!GPT, which scored 80% on equally generous terms (and note that Sept!GPT-4 gave more answers).</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Inconclusive.</p>



<h2><span id="Test_2_Rock_Music_Trivia"></span>Test 2: Rock Music Trivia: <span></span></h2>



<p>Prompt: <em>“What is Grant Hart’s song “Seka Knows” about?”</em></p>



<p>(For reference: <a href="https://pastes.io/n8xlos5jwj" target="_blank" rel="noopener">March!GPT’s answers</a>, <a href="https://pastes.io/ttk2hzoviy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">June!GPT’s answers</a>)</p>



<p><a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/2d7881b4-d887-4907-a7de-a53899e804f2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sept!GPT4: blah blah blah blah blah blah…</a></p>



<p><strong>Assessment: </strong>garbage. I don’t want a biography of Grant Hart. I don’t care that he was in Husker Du. I know I can make up my own interpretation for his songs. <em>None</em> of this is what I asked for.</p>



<p>GPT4 seems to have a default word count of 200-500 that it tries to hit, come hell or high water. But sometimes a perfectly good answer consists of only one or two words. It could have just said <em>“i don’t know lol! ¯\_(ツ)_/¯” </em>and saved some tokens. That’s all its answer amounts to. But it’s been RLHF’d into thinking short answers are bad (when more often the <em>opposite</em> is true), so it just waffles on. </p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>“as of my last update in September 2021, there hasn’t been any definitive explanation from Hart himself about the specific meaning of the son”</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>He died in 2017, you dick. </p>



<p>Also, let us pause to admire the sublime, lapidary worthlessness of this paragraph:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>“With that said, analyzing the lyrics and considering Hart’s writing style, one can attempt to interpret the meaning of the song. When listening to or reading the lyrics of any song, it’s essential to remember that individual interpretation can vary, and personal feelings and experiences often play a significant role in how one might understand a song’s meaning.”</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s the text equivalent of a pure white cloud; or a blank canvas, unsullied by the faintest hint of meaning. Are you telling me it learned to write that way from studying us? The mind quails…</p>



<p><strong>Prompt:</strong> “How is David Bowie associated with numbers and numerology?”</p>



<p>(For reference: <a href="https://pastes.io/c8nrle0gh4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">March!GPT4’s answer</a>, <a href="https://pastes.io/nyllb8k1l9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">June!GPT4’s answer</a>)</p>



<p><a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/de0de201-a996-440e-8049-0a3f3f28ba67" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sept!GPT4’s answer</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Assessment:</strong> fair answer! Perhaps better than March!GPT4. It mentions “Station to Station”, but also gets “Quicksand”, which is a deeper cut.</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>“Album and Song Release Dates: Some fans and researchers have speculated that Bowie occasionally chose release dates with numerological significance.”</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>I’ve never heard that. Hallucination? Does Sept!GPT4 know more than I do?</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>“Lazarus”: The song “Lazarus” from the “Blackstar” album references the biblical figure who rose from the dead.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>That’s a hallucination. “Lazarus” is based on an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazarus_(musical)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">off-Broadway play</a> which is based on a book (which is based on etc). Chris O’Leary thinks the song might also be about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Lazarus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Emma Lazarus</a>, because the lyrics prominently reference New York. What does the biblical story of Lazarus have to do with numerology, anyway?</p>



<p><strong>Prompt:</strong> “Provide a list of thrash metal albums released in a year that’s a multiple of 5 (example: 1905)”</p>



<p>(For reference: <a href="https://pastes.io/mpnwggppma" target="_blank" rel="noopener">March!GPT4’s answer</a>, <a href="https://pastes.io/ezhjo8caef" target="_blank" rel="noopener">June!GPT4’s answer</a>)</p>



<p><a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/04ccb5c6-cf9e-47d5-b0cd-1afb67184844" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sept!GPT4’s answer</a>. </p>



<p><strong><strong>Assessment</strong>:</strong> And now we’re cooking! This is a <em>shockingly</em> good and comprehensive list. All the albums are thrash, and the dates it supplies are correct (even when they aren’t a multiple of 5). This surpasses March!GPT4, and blows June!GPT4 out of the water. </p>



<p><strong>Quibbles and points of interest</strong>:</p>



<ul>
<li>The genesis of the thrash metal genre is typically dated to 1981, with “Hit the Lights” by Leather Charm (a proto-Metallica band by James Hetfield and Ron McGovney). Late 1970s is a stretch. </li>



<li>It lumps a 1992 album into the 1995 bracket, when 1990 would make more sense.</li>



<li>It tries to put five albums in every year (and when it can’t find any, it counts thrash albums from surrounding years—you can actually see thrash metal’s commercial collapse in the mid 90s from this!). As with the Italian history example, I am struck by the sense that it interprets prompts too literally. I did not specify a number of albums, so it just glommed onto the number 5. </li>



<li><em>“Given that my last training data ends in 2021, I won’t have exhaustive knowledge of 2020 albums.”</em> ???</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: inconclusive. </p>



<p>Some answers were worse. Some were better. The thrash metal answer was a star turn. Sept!GPT-4 is more of a metalhead than an alt-rock fan, I’d say.</p>



<h2><span id="Test_3_Quake_Polygons"></span>Test 3: Quake Polygons<span></span></h2>



<p><strong>Prompt:</strong> “How many polygons could the videogame Quake render per frame?”</p>



<p>(For reference: <a href="https://coagulopath.com/yeah-gpt-4-got-worse/#Part_3_Quake_Polygons">March!GPT4 and June!GPT4’s answers</a>)</p>



<p><a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/e8e48350-6cff-4eca-aaac-55475268f684" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sept!GPT4’s answer</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>“The original “Quake,” developed by id Software and released in 1996, was a pioneering game in terms of its 3D graphics engine. While modern games boast the capacity to render millions or even billions of polygons per frame, games in the mid-90s operated under much more constrained hardware capabilities.</em></p>



<p><em>“Quake” didn’t rely on hardware acceleration initially; it was rendered in software mode. In software mode, Quake’s performance heavily depended on the CPU. The actual number of polygons “Quake” could render per frame varied based on the scene, the level of detail, and the capabilities of the machine it ran on.</em></p>



<p><em>Typically, Quake’s scenes ranged from a few hundred to a few thousand polygons. The more detailed scenes could potentially push towards the upper end of this range. With the advent of hardware-accelerated graphics (like with the introduction of 3Dfx’s Voodoo graphics cards), “Quake” could benefit from increased performance, allowing for smoother gameplay at higher resolutions.</em></p>



<p><em>It’s worth noting that this is a very general estimate and the actual number could vary based on multiple factors, including scene complexity, active game entities, and hardware specifics.”</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p><strong><strong>Assessment</strong></strong>: I didn’t ask for a book report and “billions of polygons” is stupid. But the core answer of “a few hundred to a few thousand polygons” is correct, and may even be superior to March!GPT4, which stuck to the lower end of that range. </p>



<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: inconclusive.</p>



<h2><span id="Test_4_Rope_Burn_Puzzle"></span>Test 4: Rope Burn Puzzle<span></span></h2>



<p><strong>Prompt</strong>: <em>“You have three ropes and some matches. The ropes burn irregularly like fuses when lit at either end. The first rope burns in 48 minutes, the second rope burns in 72 minutes and the third rope burns in 128 minutes. How can you produce a time interval of 61 minutes?”</em></p>



<p>(For reference: <a href="https://coagulopath.com/yeah-gpt-4-got-worse/#Part_4_Rope_Burn_Puzzle">March!GPT4 and June!GPT4’s answers</a>)</p>



<p><a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/01a94e3a-6ce3-4bff-9080-c799bc993fe4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sept!GPT4’s answer</a></p>



<p><strong>Assessment</strong>: The fuck did I just read?</p>



<p>It’s hard to judge whether it does better or worse than March!GPT4 or June!GPT4. I’m starting to think this puzzle is simply beyond GPT4’s pay grade. I’ve tried it dozens of times and with many wordings. It does not ever solve it.</p>



<p>It grasps the <em>principle</em>, grasps the underlying method (burning ropes at multiple ends), but it always makes the same mistake—burning the wrong rope, and then trying to weasel out by saying “measure time using some other method.”</p>



<p>Gemini will launch soon. I wonder if it can solve it?</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Rope burning puzzles are a common class of interview question. GPT-4 can solve a two-rope variant easily. This three-rope variant is from <a href="https://momath.org/home/varsity-math/varsity-math-week-151/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Varsity Math Week 151</a>. Notably, the <em>answer </em>is also on the internet (and probably in GPT4’s training data)…but it’s in Varsity Math Week 152. Maybe if both the puzzle and the answer were on the same page, GPT4 would solve it. I don’t know how this stuff works. </p>



<h2><span id="Conclusion"></span>Conclusion<span></span></h2>



<p>My tests (for the little they’re worth) show no consistent pattern. Sometimes GPT4 does better than before, sometimes worse. </p>



<p>This is not testing, it’s sheep-entrail reading. I <em>do </em>faintly suspect it’s worse on obscure general knowledge, but I don’t believe that hard enough to bet almost any amount of money.</p>



<p><a href="https://coagulopath.com/witches-vs-chatgpt/">As I’ve said before, AIs present a fluctuating target.</a> I do not think they have a stable “baseline” ability that remains resilient to prompting differences and stochastic factors. In any event, OpenAI has many dials they can turn behind the scenes. </p>



<p>We’d learn more about this beast over hundreds or thousands of tests. But GPT-4 is too expensive for that to be realistic. OpenAI could really help the community by offering an academic discount—not that weirdos on the internet would qualify, of course!</p>



<p>Lastly, a “good” response is more subjective than I thought. Is it better for a wrong answer to have 500 words or 10 words? Is it better for an AI to try and fail, or to simply give up? When a query has conflicting requirements (“I want a list of all college majors in the US. Do not use more than 10 words.”) what should it do? And when a technically “correct” answer is <em>bad for the user </em>(consider XY problems such as “how do I echo the last three letters of a filename?”—GPT4 flunks this one, by the way), what do we want an AI to do?</p>



<p>GPT4 has changed and will continue to change. We’d be wise to do the same. I will be far less confident in my future predictions. When I say AI has gotten dumb, I might be speaking into a mirror.</p>

Developed by IBM in the 1970s and popularized by Oracle and a slew of other database systems in the ‘80s, the relational model and SQL revolutionized the database industry.</p><h2><span id="sql-and-the-relational-model"></span>SQL and the relational model</h2><p>Before introducing the relational model and SQL, the hierarchical and network databases from the late 1960s and 1970s were inflexible and difficult to use. I had struggled to use and maintain these systems, and when I learned SQL, it was a breath of fresh air. Compared to earlier databases, the flexibility of the relational model, together with SQL, made it much easier to modify the database schema. It also dramatically simplified the job of preparing reports, typically printed on huge stacks of contiguous paper. Those were the days.</p><p>Most importantly, SQL databases made supporting highly consistent <a target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID#Consistency_(Correctness)">ACID transactions</a><a target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID#Consistency_(Correctness)"><span><i></i></span></a> easy. This simplified application development and, even today, SQL transactions form the basis of most business systems.</p><p>Most people think of SQL and the relational model as synonymous, which is sensible because of SQL’s long-term dominance. However, they are not the same thing. The relational model is a set of mathematical concepts applied to data of different shapes. It is the most general form of database mathematics and provides a mathematical foundation to effectively support any operation within a given domain.</p><p>On the other hand, SQL is a database language that supports an important subset of relational capabilities. SQL’s design works with structured data or tables. Decades of evolution have made SQL databases quite good at this. Relational tables are a powerful data model. They are excellent at some things, particularly analytics. Modern analytic SQL databases like Snowflake or BigQuery deliver business insights at incredible scale to thousands of simultaneous users. These SQL databases are the slicer-dicers of historical, analytic data.</p><h2><span id="limitations-of-sql-for-data-analytics"></span>Limitations of SQL for data analytics</h2><p>SQL is now an industry standard for analytic operations. However, there are database problems that SQL does not address when it is awkward or impossible to model data as a table. For example, SQL struggles with complex sets of interconnected objects modeled as a graph. Graph data does not easily fit into the structured tables SQL’s design accommodates. Because SQL is inappropriate for graph data, the industry needs alternative approaches to solve this problem.</p><p>New products based on the relational model seek to address these unsolved analytic database problems. <a target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://relational.ai/">RelationalAI</a><a target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://relational.ai/"><span><i></i></span></a> drives this effort in close partnership with data warehouse providers – and the Modern Data Stack – to deliver a relational co-processor for applications that require a graph data model.</p><h2><span id="sql-and-operational-applications"></span>SQL and operational applications</h2><p>Operational databases are the data workhorses for business applications used by people worldwide. SQL products like Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, and PostgreSQL commonly serve as operational databases. The consistent transactional semantics provided by SQL deliver a strong foundation for building business applications.</p><p>Operational applications have very different requirements than analytics. The structured table is an ideal data model for many operations when analyzing data. The combination of tables and the relational model makes it easy to query and transform data.</p><p>However, the structured table has an impedance mismatch for operational applications with modern object-oriented programming languages like Python, Javascript, Go, and others. These programming languages use a nested, object-oriented, in-memory data model. Writing this data to disk for long-term storage is most naturally modeled as hierarchical, semi-structured data. The popular Javascript Object Notation (JSON) file format perfectly maps to the Javascript memory model millions of programmers worldwide use.</p><p>The mismatch in the data model between application programming languages and SQL databases is a decades-long issue. A common solution is called an object-relational mapping layer. ORM solutions like <a target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://hibernate.org/">Hibernate</a><a target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://hibernate.org/"><span><i></i></span></a> for Java have existed for over 20 years. These products try to bridge the gap between SQL-structured tables and modern languages' object-oriented in-memory data structures. While the industry has considerable experience using ORMs, they are an awkward solution that can cause application and performance issues.</p><p>More importantly, the rigid structure of SQL tables is inconsistent with the frequent changes required by many modern applications. Languages like TypeScript have popularized an innovative approach known as gradual typing, a combination of dynamic and static types that enables experimentation and rapid development while still providing the performance and verifiability of static typing for the more refined and stable parts of the design.</p><p>Unfortunately, if you are using SQL, the development flexibility enabled by modern languages does not extend to the database. SQL databases require a static, fully structured schema. While SQL supports schema evolution, the highly structured design of SQL tables requires planned, thoughtful database migration and updates. Because of the need to model data in structured tables, SQL database schema modifications are a bottleneck for developing many applications.</p><p>SQL is a database language that lacks a standardized approach to procedural logic. While many operational SQL databases have stored procedure extensions, the procedural logic for most applications is embedded within an application server connected to a SQL database using a stateful, persistent session. This design approach for SQL made sense 50 years ago, but it is a painful legacy for modern, connectionless cloud services. It generally requires the application code and database to co-reside in the same data center region, and it is a particular challenge for serverless or geographically distributed  “edge” applications that cannot support persistent sessions.</p><h2><span id="document-databases"></span>Document databases</h2><p>Because of the highly structured nature of SQL databases, they are inappropriate for applications that primarily work with dynamic, semi-structured data. Examples of this are chat and email applications that support threaded conversations. These applications are naturally hierarchical, and the objects within them have a dynamic set of properties. NoSQL databases, introduced over a decade ago, support these highly dynamic applications. There are different types of NoSQL databases, but document databases support a semi-structured data model based on JSON documents. Three popular document databases today are MongoDB, Amazon DynamoDB, and Microsoft Cosmos.</p><p>A document database stores the data within a collection of hierarchical, semi-structured documents. You can think of this as a tree with each branch potentially containing different data properties. With a document database, the atomicity of a transaction is typically a single document, often using an eventually consistent transaction model. The approach works well for intermittently connected, distributed applications like chat.</p><p>One major advantage of document databases is that they are usually much easier to scale than an operational SQL database. Organizing data into collections of tree-structured documents provides a natural grouping that simplifies sharding across multiple servers, enabling document databases to support multi-tenant applications at enormous scale.</p><p>Document databases' dynamic, semi-structured nature also makes them easier to integrate into modern programming languages. There is no need for ORM mapping layers since in-memory objects can directly serialize into JSON documents.</p><p>The simplicity and scale advantages of document databases have ensured their ongoing popularity. However, transactional atomicity and consistency limitations have prevented their broader adoption in business applications. Today’s document databases are inappropriate for the widespread, debit-credit style business transactions that require high consistency <em>across documents and collections</em>.</p><h2><span id="introducing-fql-the-document-relational-database-language"></span>Introducing FQL, the document-relational database language</h2><p>Fauna is a battle-tested database service that delivers highly consistent, <a target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serializability">strictly serialized</a><a target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serializability"><span><i></i></span></a> atomic transactions across documents and multiple collections of documents. Fauna has always been a great database, and its API delivery model means that developers never have to worry about provisioning, sharding, or replication. But until recently, the database language was not easy for developers to use. The introduction of the new FQL language changes that. FQL combines the advantages of the relational model and the simplicity of semi-structured documents.</p><p>The document data model is a good match for applications written using dynamic languages like Javascript or Python. FQL is a modern, Typescript-inspired database language for semi-structured documents that integrates naturally with dynamic languages. FQL provides optional schema support to ensure correctness and enable large, complex applications written in typesafe languages like Typescript or C#. Because it is relational, FQL supports queries with join operations across document collections.</p><p>With FQL, every request to the database is one strictly serialized transaction. Each transaction supports relational queries together with procedural logic. FQL is a <a target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness">turing-complete</a><a target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness"><span><i></i></span></a> database language that supports complex, multi-step transactions, encapsulating the transaction logic within a single database request.</p><p>Because each transaction is entirely self-contained and independent, there is no need to maintain any session state. This allows the database to reside in a region that is a long distance from the application. A standard HTTPS connection provides the transport, and <a target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://jwt.io/introduction/">JWT-compatible</a><a target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://jwt.io/introduction/"><span><i></i></span></a>, attribute-based access control tokens ensure security. These capabilities are all designed to work seamlessly with modern developer operations processes and products.</p><p>Fauna is a multi-availability zone database that uses a <a target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://cs.yale.edu/homes/thomson/publications/calvin-sigmod12.pdf">Calvin</a><a target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://cs.yale.edu/homes/thomson/publications/calvin-sigmod12.pdf"><span><i></i></span></a>-derived, consensus-based transaction protocol to ensure business continuity. With Fauna, databases replicate across three availability zones that can be co-located within a single region, a geographic area (i.e., Europe or the United States), or distributed anywhere globally. Fauna’s intelligent routing layer delivers a single global database endpoint that ensures applications always route to the closest database region. Because of Fauna’s API delivery model, all of this comes with no operational overhead for developers.</p><h2><span id="beyond-sql"></span>Beyond SQL</h2><p>The relational model has endured because it provides a general-purpose, mathematical database foundation. SQL is the standard for working with structured tables, which will continue. But it is time to break the relational model free from tables.</p><p>For the first time, Fauna and FQL bring the benefits of the relational model together with semi-structured document data. To make this possible, SQL is the one thing that Fauna had to leave behind. But once you start working with FQL, you won’t miss it.</p><p>You can find out more about Fauna <a target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://fauna.com/">here</a><a target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://fauna.com/"><span><i></i></span></a>.</p></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/09/15/marc-benioff-salesforce-says-hes-remote-worker-office-return/">https://fortune.com/2023/09/15/marc-benioff-salesforce-says-hes-remote-worker-office-return/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37531965">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>The office is crucial for professional development. You can’t expect to grow in your career without spending time with your coworkers, learning by osmosis, picking up cues from observing your superiors, and bonding with your peers and managers.&nbsp;</p><div>



<p>That’s been the party line for the past three and a half years among CEOs who are insistent that remote work has no staying power—or that it shouldn’t, at least, among anyone with ambitions of climbing the corporate ladder.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just ask Twitter’s Elon Musk (who has said remote workers are just <a href="https://fortune.com/2022/07/20/elon-musk-remote-work-from-home-pretend-to-work/" target="_self" rel="">pretending to work</a>), Goldman Sachs’ David Solomon (who called working from home <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/08/10/wall-street-return-to-office-employee-mandates-wfh-hybrid-remote-work/" target="_self" rel="">an aberration</a>) or Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg (who said it’s <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/03/15/meta-ceo-mark-zuckerberg-facebook-return-to-office-remote-work/" target="_self" rel="">easier to build trust</a> when you’re working in person). It’s also ostensibly been the belief system of <a href="https://fortune.com/company/salesforce-com/" target="_blank" rel="">Salesforce</a> chief executive <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/06/06/salesforce-return-to-office-charity-incentive/" target="_self" rel="">Marc Benioff</a>, who even went so far as to bribe his workers into returning to the office by promising to donate $10 to a charity of a worker’s choice for each day they come in.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But at the 21st annual Dreamforce summit in San Francisco this week, Benioff <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JAEBiA8bd0" target="_self" rel="">told MSNBC</a>’s Stephanie Ruhle that he believes in the benefits of remote work—especially for him. <a href="https://fortune.com/company/amazon-com/" target="_blank" rel="">Amazon</a> CEO Andy Jassy, Ruhle pointed out, recently said workers who <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/08/29/amazon-ceo-andy-jassy-return-to-office-mandate-or-face-consequences/" target="_self" rel="">refuse to return to the office</a> “may be facing pink slips.” Benioff’s take?</p>



<p>“Well, I’m a remote worker. I’ve always been a remote worker my whole life. I don’t work well in an office,” Benioff said. “It just doesn’t work for my personality. I can’t tell you why. I do love to go in to visit customers, though. I’m on the road constantly visiting customers.”</p>



<p>Ruhle then asked why the rules differ for <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/09/15/salesforce-ceo-marc-benioff-hiring-boomerang-employees-layoffs/" target="_self" rel="">Salesforce employees</a>, most of whom are required to come into the office <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/news/stories/return-remote-how-salesforce-brings-employees-together-for-modern-work/" target="_self" rel="">three days per week</a> since this past spring. </p>



<p>“For my people, my message [is] they need to mix in-person and remote together,” Benioff said. “[It’s] great to be together and also get productivity at home. Our engineers are extremely productive at home. We have lots of people who are extremely productive at home. But there also [have] to be salespeople who are productive in the office. We need to make it all work.”</p>



<h2><strong>Benioff’s back and forth</strong></h2>



<p>Despite the divorce between Benioff’s personal preferences and his hopes for his workforce, he nonetheless has kept a more measured approach to in-person work than some of his Fortune 500 peers. His comments on MSNBC this week are his latest zag in his many years of waffling on the issue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2022, Benioff insisted that return-to-office mandates, unlike what Elon Musk or <a href="https://fortune.com/2022/04/18/jpmorgan-ceo-jamie-dimon-concedes-partial-defeat-return-to-office-mandate-real-estate/" target="_self" rel="">Jamie Dimon</a> were saying at the time, were <a href="https://fortune.com/2022/06/23/salesforce-marc-benioff-slams-return-to-office-mandates/" target="_self" rel="">“never going to work,”</a> echoing the company’s standing policy at the time that let employees decide where to work from. But back in March of this year, he <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/03/07/salesforce-ceo-marc-benioff-remote-work-in-office-mandate-productivity/" target="_self" rel="">said</a> that the new Salesforce employees who show up in person do better, because they’re “meeting people, being onboarded, being trained.” If they’re “at home and not going through that process, we don’t think they’re as successful.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Benioff&nbsp;<a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2023/03/on-with-kara-swisher-a-long-tough-talk-with-marc-benioff.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suggested</a>&nbsp;that Salesforce would require different amounts of in-office time for different departments, but refused to call it a mandate. “I don’t want to force anybody,” he said, reasoning that pressing the issue too forcefully would only cause a talent shortage. “We don’t want to lose our stars.” Rather than use brute force, he hoped the company could provide “reasons” for voluntarily returning. But the leash remains short; Salesforce would always have at least a portion of its workforce working face-to-face. (In another zigzag, Benioff is also encouraging boomerang employees to come back into the fold and apply to one of its 3,300 open roles after <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/09/15/salesforce-ceo-marc-benioff-hiring-boomerang-employees-layoffs/" target="_self" rel="">laying off 10%</a> of its workforce.) </p>



<p>Post-pandemic, Benioff told Ruhle, he and other Salesforce senior executives have had “many long aggressive conversations” about downsizing their real estate footprint.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We just don’t need as much [office space] anymore, because our employees learned how—during the pandemic—to work at home,” Benioff said. “And now…we can do both: Be very successful, innovate, be with our customers, make it all work, have great revenues, high margins, great cash flow, do it all. And here’s the result—look at this conference.”</p>



<p>The Dreamforce conference generated about $90 million for the local San Francisco business community, and brought over 40,000 people to a city whose in-office population remains 60% below pre-pandemic levels, per the <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/sf/article/dreamforce-s-f-big-crowds-openai-sam-altman-ai-18360762.php#:~:text=Making%20attendees%20feel%20safe%20and,%25%20below%20pre%2Dpandemic%20levels." target="_self" rel=""><em>San Francisco Chronicle</em></a>. That means even if they do show up to company headquarters three days per week, Benioff’s employees will be the anomaly.&nbsp;</p></div><div id="text1_wrapper" data-cy="subscriptionPlea">

That's relying on the <code>$TERM</code>, <code>$TERM_PROGRAM</code>, and <code>$XDG_SESSION_TYPE</code> variables, make sure you don't overwrite them by mistake!</p>
<p dir="auto">For instance, if your terminal is Alacritty, which doesn't support displaying images itself, but you are running on an X11/Wayland environment,

<!-- cache hit 80:single/related:74e749690e395b83c7bb0b10280b925f --><!-- empty -->
<p>Yesterday, some of the biggest textbook publishers <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Cengage-v-LibGen-9-14-2023-Complaint.pdf">sued</a> Library Genesis, an illegal shadow library that publishers accused of "extensive violations of federal copyright law."</p>
<p>Publishers suing include Cengage Learning, Macmillan Learning, McGraw Hill, and Pearson Education. They claimed that Library Genesis (aka Libgen) is operated by unknown individuals based outside the United States, who know that the shadow library is "one of the largest, most notorious, and far-reaching infringement operations in the world" and intentionally violate copyright laws with "absolutely no legal justification for what they do."</p>
<p>According to publishers, Libgen offers free downloads for over 20,000 books that the publishers never authorized Libgen to distribute. They claimed that Libgen is "a massive piracy effort" and noted that their complaint may be updated if more infringed works are found. This vast infringement is causing publishers and authors serious financial and creative harm, publishers alleged.</p>
<p>"The Libgen sites deprive plaintiffs and their authors of income from their creative works, devalue the textbook market and plaintiffs’ works, and may cause plaintiffs to cease publishing certain works," the complaint said.</p>
<p>This is not the first lawsuit to go after Libgen, and if history repeats, it likely won't be the last. <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/publishers-lawsuit-accuses-libgen-of-staggering-copyright-infringement-230915/">TorrentFreak reported</a> that after the publisher Elsevier sued Libgen in 2015, a court ordered Libgen to shut down. But after briefly disappearing, Libgen popped back up and has been online ever since, operating in defiance of that order—as well as court orders "in several countries, including Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, and the United Kingdom," publishers' complaint filed yesterday said. Those countries even tried ordering "Internet service providers to block access to Libgen Sites as a result of infringement actions," publishers said, all seemingly to no avail.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>It's hard to say if the new lawsuit will have better luck forcing Libgen offline. Publishers have asked a US district court in New York to order Libgen to pay damages that <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/publishers-lawsuit-accuses-libgen-of-staggering-copyright-infringement-230915/">TorrentFreak estimated</a> could exceed $30 million. They also want an order blocking Libgen from any future or ongoing infringement, an accounting and disgorgement of Libgen's profits, the destruction of all Libgen's copies of infringed works, and an order forcing all of Libgen's domain names to either be transferred to publishers or deleted.</p>
<h2>Anonymity is key to Libgen's success</h2>
<p>According to Similarweb data cited in the complaint, Libgen attracted "an average of over 9 million visitors per month from the United States" from March through May 2023. This includes tons of students whom publishers claimed are "bombarded with messages to use Libgen sites" on social media rather than paying full price for textbooks. This, publishers claimed, devalues the textbook market and caused a "substantial decline in revenue from sales."</p>
<p>Instead of paying publishers to distribute books like a real library does, the complaint alleged, Libgen profits off pirated works by running advertisements alongside e-book downloads for things like online games and browser extensions. Sometimes Libgen's ads, publishers claimed, "appear to be phishing attempts, which can result in users downloading a virus or other malicious program onto their computers." Libgen also fields donations from users, reporting that it has raised $182,540 so far in 2023, the complaint noted.</p>
<p>Publishers said the key to Libgen's success as a pirate website is its carefully guarded anonymity. Libgen staff, the publishers alleged, hide behind usernames like "librarian" or "bookwarrior" and rely "on proxy services that specifically conceal website operators’ identifying information." As a business, Libgen never provides names or addresses as contact information, and when they register for new domains, they use registrars that "keep registrant information private and/or registrant proxy services."</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>So far, they've proven seemingly impossible to unmask, but Libgen's operators "are believed to reside outside of the United States at unknown foreign locations," the complaint said. But while Libgen staff remains anonymous, publishers know that they also "rely on US companies as intermediaries to operate the sites," and those companies could help disable the operation. Those companies include Cloudflare, Protocol Labs, Namecheap, and Google, which publishers claimed help to enable Libgen's file-sharing, proxy services, domain registrations, and search engine services.</p>
<p>Thanks in part to these US companies, Libgen operators can "rely on the anonymity of the Internet and their overseas locations to hide their names and addresses and frustrate enforcement efforts against them," publishers alleged.</p>
<p>Publishers hope their lawsuit will finally end years of Libgen's alleged mass copyright infringement, but shadow libraries like Libgen have proven resilient through multiple attacks from the highest levels of US law enforcement. Even when the US government <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/11/feds-arrest-russians-accused-of-running-the-largest-pirated-ebook-library/">arrested operators of another shadow library called Z-Library</a> last year, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/02/z-library-returns-aims-to-avoid-seizures-by-giving-each-user-a-secret-url/">Z-Library returned</a> a few months later and found a way to continue operating <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/05/us-seizes-z-library-login-domain-but-secret-urls-for-each-user-remain-active/">after the US seized its login domain</a>.</p>
<p>Ars could not immediately reach publishers' lawyers or Libgen for comment. [<strong>Update:</strong> Publishers' lawyer Matthew Oppenheim told Ars that Libgen is a "thieves' den" of illegal books, and "there is no question" that Libgen's conduct is "massively illegal." Oppenheim said that "really, the only question is why it's been allowed to exist this long." He also said that it's possible that US companies may not realize that they are aiding Libgen's infringement, but publishers hope that when they "are confronted" with the fact "that this library is massively illegal, that hopefully they will voluntarily do the right thing" and cut off Libgen.]</p>
