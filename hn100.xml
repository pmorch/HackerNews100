<h3>from the <i>QWACs-in-the-web</i> dept</h3>

<p>The EU is currently updating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EIDAS">eIDAS</a> (electronic IDentification, Authentication and trust Services), an EU regulation on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the European Single Market. That’s clearly a crucial piece of legislation in the digital age, and updating it is sensible given the fast pace of development in the sector. But it seems that something bad has happened in the process. Back in March 2022, a group of experts sent an <a href="https://www.eff.org/files/2022/03/02/eidas_cybersecurity_community_open_letter_1_1.pdf">open letter to MEPs</a> [pdf] with the dramatic title “Global website security ecosystem at risk from EU Digital Identity framework’s new website authentication provisions”. It warned:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The Digital Identity framework includes provisions that are intended to increase the take-up of <strong>Qualified Website Authentication Certificates</strong> (QWACs), a specific EU form of website certificate that was created in the 2014 eIDAS regulation but which – owing to flaws with its technical implementation model – has not gained popularity in the web ecosystem. The Digital Identity framework mandates browsers accept QWACs issued by Trust Service Providers, <strong>regardless of the security characteristics of the certificates or the policies that govern their</strong> <strong>issuance</strong>. This legislative approach introduces significant weaknesses into the global multi-stakeholder ecosystem for securing web browsing, and will significantly increase the cybersecurity risks for users of the web.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The near-final text for eIDAS 2.0 has now been agreed by the EU’s negotiators, and it seems that it is even worse than the earlier draft. A new site from Mozilla called “<a href="https://last-chance-for-eidas.org/">Last Chance to fix eIDAS</a>” explains how new legislative articles will require all Web browsers in Europe to trust the the certificate authorities and cryptographic keys selected by the government of EU Member States. Mozilla explains:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>These changes radically expand the capability of EU governments to surveil their citizens by ensuring cryptographic keys under government control can be used to intercept encrypted web traffic across the EU. Any EU member state has the ability to designate cryptographic keys for distribution in web browsers and browsers are forbidden from revoking trust in these keys without government permission.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>This enables the government of any EU member state to issue website certificates for interception and surveillance which can be used against every EU citizen, even those not resident in or connected to the issuing member state. There is no independent check or balance on the decisions made by member states with respect to the keys they authorize and the use they put them to. This is particularly troubling given that adherence to the rule of law has <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/agenda/briefing/2022-05-02/6/rule-of-law-in-hungary-and-poland-plenary-debate-and-resolution">not been uniform</a> across all member states, with documented instances of <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20230524IPR91910/hungary-meps-denounce-deliberate-and-systematic-efforts-to-undermine-eu-values">coercion by secret police</a> for political purposes.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To make matters worse, browser producers will be forbidden from carrying out routine and necessary checks:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The text goes on to ban browsers from applying security checks to these EU keys and certificates except those pre-approved by the EU’s IT standards body – ETSI. This rigid structure would be problematic with any entity, but government-controlled standard bodies are especially susceptible to <a href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/nsas-subversion-nists-algorithm">misaligned incentives</a> in cryptography. ETSI in particular has both a <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/02/ets-isnt-tls-and-you-shouldnt-use-it">concerning</a> <a href="https://news.rub.de/english/press-releases/2021-06-16-it-security-backdoor-mobile-phone-encryption-90s-still-exists">track</a> <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/4a3n3j/backdoor-in-police-radios-tetra-burst">record</a> of producing compromised cryptographic standards and a <a href="https://www.etsi.org/committee/li">working group</a> dedicated entirely to developing interception technology.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/european-signature-dialog/">European Signature Dialog</a>, which aims “to connect major European Trust Service Providers to share best practices, develop a common industry viewpoint on regulatory issues and empower European solutions for guaranteed data-security,” disagrees with Mozilla’s analysis. In <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/european-signature-dialog_mozilla-campaign-pushes-serious-misinformation-activity-6978078620279824384-ByAc/">a post on LinkedIn</a> it writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Mozilla has recently launched a campaign that pushes serious misinformation about the current eIDAS legislation in order to block changes to Article 45 covering the EU’s Qualified Web Authentication Certificates (“QWACs”).</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A <a href="https://www.european-signature-dialog.eu/ESD_answer_to_Mozilla_misinformation_campaign.pdf">document</a> [pdf] from European Signature Dialog offers what it claims are refutations of Mozilla’s analysis. I will leave it to technical experts to decide who is right on the detailed points it discusses – for those interested in understanding the underlying technology, there’s an <a href="https://educatedguesswork.org/posts/eidas-article45/">excellent introduction to eIDAS and QWACs</a> from Eric Rescorla on the Educated Guesswork blog. But there’s a less technical issue too. Mozilla writes that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>forcing browsers to automatically trust government-backed certificate authorities is a key tactic used by authoritarian regimes, and these actors would be emboldened by the legitimising effect of the EU’s actions. In short, if this law were copied by another state, it could lead to serious threats to cybersecurity and fundamental rights.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To which European Signature Dialog responds:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The European Union is not controlling the “roots” used by the issuers of QWACs, and so the EU can’t use the certificates to “spy” on EU citizens. Mozilla should be ashamed of itself for suggesting this.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>While it may be true that the European Union itself is not controlling the roots, what Mozilla says is that the <strong>individual </strong><strong>governments of EU Member States</strong> will indeed be able to do precisely that, which means their intelligence services, for example, will be able to carry out <a href="https://last-chance-for-eidas.org/art45interception.html">surveillance of encrypted Web traffic</a>.</p>
<p>European Signature Dialog concludes its reply to Mozilla’s analysis by asking “Why is Mozilla spreading this misinformation”, and answering its own question with: “Mozilla is generally perceived as a Google satellite, paving the way for Google to push through its own commercial interests”. Attacking the motives of Mozilla in this way, suggesting that it is just some “satellite” of Google, suggests a lack of confidence in the other arguments the European Signature Dialog has offered.</p>
<p>Moreover, the insinuation that this is just an attempt by Google to head off some pesky EU legislation is undercut by the fact that separately from Mozilla, 335 scientists and researchers from 32 countries and various NGOs have signed a <a href="https://nce.mpi-sp.org/index.php/s/cG88cptFdaDNyRr">joint statement criticizing the proposed eIDAS reform</a>. If the latest text is adopted, they warn:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>the government-controlled authority would then be able to intercept the web traffic of not only their own citizens, but all EU citizens, including banking information, legally privileged information, medical records and family photos. This would be true even when visiting non-EU websites, as such an authority could issue certificates for any website that all browsers would have to accept. Additionally, although much of eIDAS2.0 regulation carefully gives citizens the capability to opt out from usage of new services and functionality, this is not the case for Article 45. Every citizen would have to trust those certificates, and thus every citizen would see their online safety threatened.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It concludes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>This regulation does not eliminate any existing risk. Instead, by undermining the existing secure web authentication processes, introduces new risks with no gain by European citizens, businesses, and institutions. Moreover, if this regulation becomes a reality, it is only to be expected that other countries will put pressure on browsers to obtain similar privileges as EU Member States — as <a href="https://censoredplanet.org/kazakhstan">some have unsuccessfully attempted in the past</a> — globally endangering web security.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Confirming the bad faith of the EU negotiators, these new and dangerous elements of eIDAS were added in closed-door meetings without any public consultation of experts. It’s a blatant power-grab by the EU, already attempting to circumvent encryption elsewhere with its <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/10/26/eu-pitched-client-side-scanning-by-targeting-certain-eu-residents-with-misleading-ads/">Chat Control</a> proposals. It must be stopped before it undermines core elements of the Internet’s security infrastructure not just in the EU, but globally too as result of its knock-on effects.</p>

          <div>
            <p><span>A performance and resilience optimization to the authorization microservice contained a memory leak that was exposed under high traffic. This resulted in a number of pages returning 404’s that should not have. Testing the build in our canary ring did not expose the service to sufficient traffic to discover the leak, allowing it to graduate to production at 6:37 PM UTC.  The memory leak under high load caused pods to crash repeatedly starting at 6:42 PM UTC, failing authorization checks. These failures triggered alerts at 6:44 PM UTC. Rolling back the authorization service change was delayed as parts of the deployment infrastructure relied on the authorization service and required manual intervention to complete. Rollback completed at 7:08 PM UTC and all impacted GitHub features recovered after pods came back online.  We are evaluating changes to our rollout strategy to better detect this sooner and with less impact, changes to remove the dependency between authorization services and deployment rollback, and incident response improvements to reduce the overall time to recover.<p>This incident is unrelated to the Slack integration incident.  The combined status updates are a limitation of our status reporting tooling and we recognize the confusion this creates. Work to address this was already in progress and will be complete this month.</p></span>

Their specific impulse is up to three times greater than chemical rockets, they produce comparable amounts of thrust and they could be designed to accept a variety of propellants, from CO2 to ammonia.

The idea to use nuclear energy to propel spacecraft dates back to 1944. Serious testing has been done on nuclear rockets, with ground tests in 1955 and functional gigawatt-scale rockets firing for several minutes by the 1970s. The Strategic Defense Initiative rekindled studies into nuclear propulsion with Project Timberwind, a program that ran until 1991 and resulted in modern designs that were even more capable.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p><span><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-AQ3-WzSAq7g/YWhILE6uBuI/AAAAAAAAFys/WQsiqD4Fc3M5YLd-_fIRCFIoyEJEPBcBwCNcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Copernicus_NTP_2500x1000.jpg"><img data-original-height="622" data-original-width="1600" height="248" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-AQ3-WzSAq7g/YWhILE6uBuI/AAAAAAAAFys/WQsiqD4Fc3M5YLd-_fIRCFIoyEJEPBcBwCNcBGAsYHQ/w640-h248/Copernicus_NTP_2500x1000.jpg" width="640"></a></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span>We are now in the midst of another revival of this technology.

Then, we would acquire the ability to send even heavier payloads to orbit and beyond.</span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span>The modern nuclear rocket</span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span>The design and performance targets for nuclear propulsion has shifted considerably over the last few decades. The initial efforts in the 1970s were straightforward in the desire for maximum power and thrust. </span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><a href="https://fas.org/nuke/space/la-10062.pdf"><span>Project Rover</span></a><span>, for example, resulted in the Phoebus-2A reactor that managed an output of 4000 MW for 12 minutes during a test run. As a fully developed engine, it would have managed 5000 MW and 825s of specific impulse. It would have held 300 kg of enriched uranium and had a relatively cool core temperature of 2300 K (although the goal was 2500 K). Total mass was 9300 kg, meaning it had an impressive power density of 537 kW/kg.</span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span>The ultimate version of this sort of maximum power engine would be the Pebble Bed reactors from the 1980s Strategic Defence Initiative era </span><a href="https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA305996.pdf"><span>Project Timberwind</span></a><span>. The largest version aimed to operate at 3000K to achieve a specific impulse of 1000s). 12,000 MW of power served to produce 2451 kN of thrust. Power density was a whopping 1450 kW/kg.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span>More recent nuclear thermal rockets have taken a different direction. Each rocket is smaller, aiming for a thrust level of around 100 kN. Multiples are used to ensure reliability during operation. Core temperatures are reduced to prolong engine life. With no hope of being used within an atmosphere, they are vacuum-only designs with a reduced focus on power density. Instead, additional capabilities such as the ability to produce electricity continuously are featured.&nbsp;</span></span></p><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-MUpf83Q9fI4/YWhKUkF93sI/AAAAAAAAFzU/enT5m7RBcVEEzf8N02sIVgi49a-Qr3OqACNcBGAsYHQ/s1326/16-Figure14-1.png"><img data-original-height="776" data-original-width="1326" height="374" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-MUpf83Q9fI4/YWhKUkF93sI/AAAAAAAAFzU/enT5m7RBcVEEzf8N02sIVgi49a-Qr3OqACNcBGAsYHQ/w640-h374/16-Figure14-1.png" width="640"></a></td></tr><tr><td>A <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Nuclear-Thermal-Propulsion-(NTP)%3A-A-proven-growth-Borowski-McCurdy/772072e3043c7e6ee50f8e420f4f3145e4c6d5e1">Copernicus</a> Mars vehicle equipped with three SNREs.</td></tr></tbody></table><p dir="ltr"><span><span>An example of this would be the</span><a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20120012928/downloads/20120012928.pdf"><span> ‘Borowski SNRE’</span></a><span> NERVA-derived design that produces 111 kN of thrust. When operated at 2800K, it achieves a specific impulse of 925s.

Five times more fuel in total would be needed to complete the same missions as with highly enriched uranium fuel, or a greatly increased amount of neutron reflector is necessary to surround the reactor core to achieve the same power output. Either way, the power density will suffer.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span>An additional aspect of nuclear thermal rocket development needs to be addressed: the choice of propellant. Nearly all tests and designs focus on the use of liquid hydrogen as it has the potential to deliver the highest specific impulse. However, other propellants </span><a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/19910012833/downloads/19910012833.pdf"><span>have been considered</span></a><span>, especially in the context of ISRU where spacecraft are refueled with whatever is available at their destination.

It is six times denser than liquid hydrogen, can be stored at 100K, which is compatible with liquid oxygen, and it can be produced using water and carbon dioxide. At high temperatures, it breaks down into hydrogen and carbon, turning it from a 16 g/mol molecule into a 3.25 g/mol plasma. That is how it achieves a specific impulse only mildly lower than what is achievable using liquid hydrogen. Zubrin lists its specific impulse as 606s when heated to 2800K, or 625s at 3000K.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span>Nuclear Starship</span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span>A nuclear-powered Starship would not be a complete overhaul of the design.</span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>It will still be a 50m tall steel tube that launches atop the SuperHeavy booster, using vacuum-optimized engines fed by large propellant tanks, and a set of smaller gimballed engines optimized for landing, with flaps to handle reentry. Dry mass in the final version will be 120 tons and about 30 tons of propellant is reserved for landing.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span>It might be unsurprising to you that we cannot simply bolt on nuclear rockets to the Starship and expect everything to work. Special modifications have to be made to accommodate the new propulsion system, ranging from new attachment points to control software, but we will focus on the most impactful one: radiation shielding.</span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span>The shape of the Starship is not well adapted to handling the radiation from a nuclear rocket. There are large flaps extending to the sides that could scatter radiation back into the crew compartment at the top. Retracting them when the nuclear rockets are in use would be a good idea. Designs which were meant to be nuclear from the start also usually place their reactor or nuclear rocket far from the main body of the spaceship, on the end of a long boom or tapered propellant tanks. Radiation released from a fission reaction spreads as a sphere in all directions - if it is placed further away, the main body of the spaceship intercepts a smaller fraction of it.&nbsp;</span></span></p><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-URnX-Zg2Ni8/YWhV2lx_OEI/AAAAAAAAF1M/-YzDaNRFfpkw_BYTGtaidqye4CQjbHdZwCNcBGAsYHQ/s907/rns_rear.PNG"><img data-original-height="698" data-original-width="907" height="492" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-URnX-Zg2Ni8/YWhV2lx_OEI/AAAAAAAAF1M/-YzDaNRFfpkw_BYTGtaidqye4CQjbHdZwCNcBGAsYHQ/w640-h492/rns_rear.PNG" width="640"></a></td></tr><tr><td>The ideal rear end of a nuclear-propelled spacecraft, based on the <a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/19720009983/downloads/19720009983.pdf">RNS</a>.</td></tr></tbody></table><p dir="ltr"><span>The fraction of radiation that cannot be avoided is handled using radiation shielding, with different layers meant to absorb different types of radiation. It is placed as close as possible to the reactors or engines to create the widest shadow of protection, which is why they are also called shadow shields.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>A fission reaction mainly produces fission fragments, gamma rays and neutrons. Fission fragments are heavy ions that do not travel very far. Gamma rays are penetrating photons that are best absorbed by a dense material. Neutrons are high velocity subatomic particles with no charge; they are best dealt with using a material that contains as much hydrogen as possible, like water.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span>We want to use as little </span><a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20150006884/downloads/20150006884.pdf"><span>shielding mass</span></a><span> as possible.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p><span><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-A6X9mZ0m9ls/YWhO7P-8iuI/AAAAAAAAF0E/blL1jCnc-eglru5nn1qUJoSWjduUGJxOACNcBGAsYHQ/s987/risk1.PNG"><img data-original-height="987" data-original-width="716" height="640" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-A6X9mZ0m9ls/YWhO7P-8iuI/AAAAAAAAF0E/blL1jCnc-eglru5nn1qUJoSWjduUGJxOACNcBGAsYHQ/w464-h640/risk1.PNG" width="464"></a></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span>The densest elements are the best protection against gamma rays, with tungsten (W) being an ideal choice (lead would melt too easily and depleted uranium is not practical).&nbsp;</span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span>Lithium Hydride (LiH) is the most mass-efficient protection against neutrons. Boron Carbide (B4C) is 20% heavier than LiH for the same protection, but it melts at 3036K is a very strong ceramic, which is ideal for surfaces exposed to reentry heating.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span>It must be noted that some radiation protection is already built-in. The beryllium or graphite reflector within the nuclear reactor prevents some radiation from leaving. The 30 tons or more of landing propellant, especially methane, is effective at absorbing neutrons too and will always be present while in space. A much larger load of propellant will be drained as the nuclear propulsion is used, representing several meters of shielding. Furthermore, there will be a 25 meter separation between the engines and the crew compartment, so only 1/625 of the radiation is actually intercepted.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><a href="https://alternatewars.com/BBOW/Space_Engines/AIAA-2004-3863_TRITON.pdf"><span>Different</span></a><span> </span><a href="http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/radiation.php#id--Radiation_Shielding--Shielding--Shadow_Shield"><span>estimates</span></a><span> for the shielding required place the total at about 440 kg/m^2, which corresponds to 2 cm tungsten plus 2 cm of Boron Carbide. The engines themselves are about 1 meter wide, whether they produce 500 MW or 5000 MW of power, so the shielding to be added to each engine is about 345 kg. Perhaps this estimate is optimistic, but we can rely on all the previously mentioned protections to make up for any deficiency. Consider also that the effectiveness of radiation shielding is not linear but improves exponentially with its thickness - it is easy to adjust protection levels.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span>Finally, there would be significant changes to be made to supply propellant to nuclear rocket engines. We would extend them to take up the volume currently occupied by liquid oxygen. We won’t be changing the total volume of propellant tanks available to us, for a fair comparison with other versions of the Starship. If we selected liquid hydrogen, we would need specially designed tanks with insulation and active cooling. If we feed the nuclear rockets with liquid methane, we can use the same type of propellant tanks as exists today.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span>The propellant tanks dedicated to landing would also have to be changed. A nuclear Starship is expected to have a heavier dry mass, so more propellant is needed to land it, which means larger tanks.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span>With all these modifications in mind, let’s dive into the numbers.</span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span>Performance analysis</span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span>We will calculate the performance of a SpaceX starship equipped with nuclear propulsion.</span></span><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0IG6v_xCgXQ/YWhPg6tMvsI/AAAAAAAAF0M/q7xeWcFIqosTCp8HpOCpY2gTiGcWgqzCQCNcBGAsYHQ/s1554/starship1.PNG"><img data-original-height="734" data-original-width="1554" height="302" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0IG6v_xCgXQ/YWhPg6tMvsI/AAAAAAAAF0M/q7xeWcFIqosTCp8HpOCpY2gTiGcWgqzCQCNcBGAsYHQ/w640-h302/starship1.PNG" width="640"></a></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span>Two nuclear rockets are considered: a 150 kW/kg near-term design operating at 2800K, and a 1000 kW/kg far-term design operating at 3000K.

We will consider the use of traditional hydrogen propellant as well as the methane alternative, and either try to match the accelerations possible with chemical rockets or aim for a lower performance.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span>To begin, let’s begin by breaking down the existing Starship design.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span>It has three vacuum Raptors massing 1.87 tons each, three sea-level Raptors massing 1.11 tons each.

Having a Starship stage that is too lightweight means the SuperHeavy booster reaches extreme velocities that a boostback burn cannot sufficiently reduce, and without any form of thermal protection, it could become too damaged to land itself. Preventing this means reserving more propellant for the boostback burn, but this in turn means the Starship stage is released at a lower velocity.

The fuel becomes intensely radioactive. After shutdown, up to 1% of the maximum power output keeps getting released. That’s several megawatts in this case. It falls off rapidly, but radiation levels near the engine would remain lethal for days and harmful for weeks. Remember, it is unshielded around the sides and rear, so there is no protection for someone coming from those angles. NASA estimates that a nuclear rocket engine returns to its ‘safe’ state after a month.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Rapid reuse becomes complicated. Discharging the payload to orbit and then reentering means the nuclear engines are still ‘hot’ after landing. Even if the landing itself is performed with chemical Raptor engines rather than with active nuclear engines, the residual radioactivity means that any ground crew would need to be fully protected, the refueling facilities will all have to be shielded and adding a new payload then stacking it back on top of a Superheavy Booster without contaminating them become very difficult tasks.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span>Even in space, where we don’t mind irradiating the empty environment, there are issues. Approaching the International Space Station becomes impossible unless the Starship ‘cools down’ for a month in orbit. Docking maneuvers between a Starship and the craft meant to refuel it have to be done along a narrow corridor between each ship’s radiation shadows. Moon landings take place about 3 days after departure from orbit and the use of the main engines. Nuclear rockets would still be ‘hot’ by then and dangerous to any astronaut approaching from the surface. They would have to land far away from any lunar bases, and rely on shielded rovers to transfer payload across the Moon’s surface across a safe distance. The lack of any air to grant free radiation shielding means this safe distance will be very large.</span></span></p><p><span><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ShY5DCmDM_k/YWhX2VAEb0I/AAAAAAAAF1s/_ksBS-6WdwQmkMEbzbrNfoYbtB9Skv-IACNcBGAsYHQ/s2549/Starship-2019-Mars-reentry-render-SpaceX-1-crop-3-c.jpg"><img data-original-height="1175" data-original-width="2549" height="296" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ShY5DCmDM_k/YWhX2VAEb0I/AAAAAAAAF1s/_ksBS-6WdwQmkMEbzbrNfoYbtB9Skv-IACNcBGAsYHQ/w640-h296/Starship-2019-Mars-reentry-render-SpaceX-1-crop-3-c.jpg" width="640"></a></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span>It is less of an issue for Mars missions. Even the shortest missions take more than 2 months and this gives enough time for the nuclear rocket engines to become safe again.

But this is necessarily a smaller number of missions compared to the Earth-Earth or Earth-Moon missions.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span>And finally, there’s the ISRU.</span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span>Martian Starships return to Earth after being refilled by propellant produced by CO2 and water found locally. Vast fields of solar panels or fission reactors produce electricity to crack these molecules and reform them into oxygen and methane. A methane nuclear Starship needs nearly three times as much methane than a chemical Starship. It needs no oxygen, but that is a byproduct of the reaction that produces methane anyway - it is not a true saving. Three times more methane means that ISRU facilities have to be three times bigger or refuel three times less Starships, a hefty penalty.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span>Can the Nuclear Starship be saved?</span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span>It is possible to envision a nuclear Starship in the far future. Someone else decides to develop the necessary methane-propelled propulsion technology. Perhaps the basic Starship is adapted to carry more propellant volume, increasing overall mass ratios and making full use of the increased exhaust velocity.

<p>Identity and authentication management provider Okta has been hit by another breach, this one against a third-party vendor that allowed hackers to steal personal information for 5,000 Okta employees.</p>
<p>The compromise was carried out in late September against Rightway Healthcare, a service Okta uses to support employees and their dependents in finding health care providers and plan rates. An unidentified threat actor gained access to Rightway’s network and made off with an eligibility census file the vendor maintained on behalf of Okta. Okta learned of the compromise and data theft on October 12 and didn’t disclose it until Thursday, exactly three weeks later.</p>
<p>“The types of personal information contained in the impacted eligibility census file included your Name, Social Security Number, and health or medical insurance plan number,” a <a href="https://apps.web.maine.gov/online/aeviewer/ME/40/08edf96f-d599-4db9-9e1f-52453c0ba058/22d1a94b-6042-4961-914c-a043b36ae79b/document.html">letter</a> sent to affected Okta employees stated. “We have no evidence to suggest that your personal information has been misused against you.”</p>
<p>The letter, which is the first time the event has been disclosed, said that Okta opened an investigation immediately after learning of it. The investigation revealed that data for <a href="https://apps.web.maine.gov/online/aeviewer/ME/40/08edf96f-d599-4db9-9e1f-52453c0ba058.shtml">4,961 Okta employees</a> was included in the stolen file.</p>
<p>In an email, an Okta representative said that based on information Rightway provided, the intruder first gained access to a Rightway employee’s cell phone and then used that access to change credentials and take the files. The files, which were from April 2019 through 2020, were exfiltrated from Rightway’s IT environment. The personal information pertained to Okta employees and their dependents from 2019 and 2020. Okta also said that Rightway informed it that the compromise involved multiple Rightway customers.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>“This incident does not relate to the use of Okta services and Okta services remain secure,” the representative said. “No Okta customer data is impacted by this incident.”</p>
<p>Rightway representatives didn’t immediately respond to an email seeking comment and additional details about the breach.</p>
<p>Thursday’s disclosure comes two weeks after Okta <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2023/10/okta-says-hackers-breached-its-support-system-and-viewed-customer-files/">revealed</a> that hackers compromised its customer support system and obtained credentials that allowed them to take control of customers’ internal Okta administration accounts. The attackers then used those credentials in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2023/10/1password-detects-suspicious-activity-in-its-internal-okta-account/">follow-on hacks</a> that targeted the internal administration accounts of 1Password, BeyondTrust, Cloudflare, and possibly other customers.
</p><p>Okta is based in San Francisco and provides cloud identity, access management for single sign-on, multifactor authentication, and API services to thousands of organizations worldwide. The company has previously come under criticism for security breaches and its handling of them afterward. Most recently, Cloudflare called out Okta for not driving the intruders out of its network until October 18, 16 days after first learning of the compromise. Cloudflare urged Okta to act quicker in the future when learning of security breaches, providing disclosures sooner and requiring the use of hardware keys to protect internal systems and systems used by third-party support providers.</p>
<p>“For a critical security service provider like Okta, we believe following these best practices is table stakes,” Cloudflare researchers <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-cloudflare-mitigated-yet-another-okta-compromise/">wrote</a>.</p>
<p>The Okta representative said in Thursday’s email that when the company learned of the Rightway compromise on October 12, investigators had 27,000 records to sort through. Much of the process had to be manually done and took time to complete.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://bitmovin.com/av1/av1-encoding-guide/">https://bitmovin.com/av1/av1-encoding-guide/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38130089">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				
<h2>Introduction</h2>



<p>This post will provide some background information on video codecs and the pros and cons of the most common codecs used by streaming services. We’ll discuss why you should be taking advantage of newer codecs and the many benefits they can provide. Finally, we’ll provide a step-by-step guide through the factors and questions you should consider when evaluating or adding <a href="https://bitmovin.com/av1" data-type="link" data-id="https://bitmovin.com/av1">AV1</a> encoding to your workflow.</p>







<h2>What are video codecs?</h2>



<p>The word codec is a combination of the words coder and decoder. Video codecs are used to reduce or compress the size of video files for storage and transmission, because raw source files produced by professional studios or cameras use too much data to be delivered smoothly over the internet. For video streaming purposes, the master file or live source is encoded for transmission, then decoded for playback on the end-user device. This encoding typically involves lossy compression, meaning the overall file size is reduced, often significantly, with a tradeoff of slightly lower visual quality. How noticeable that quality reduction is and the amount of data compression possible depends on the codec and settings that were used.</p>







<h2>What is the best video codec?</h2>



<p>Like with many technical questions, the frustrating, but most accurate answer is “It depends.” Each codec has its own pros and cons in terms of cost, performance and support, so the best codec (or codecs) can differ based on your company’s goals, applications and business model. Let’s take a closer look at some of the high level pros and cons of the most common codecs used by streaming platforms.</p>







<h3>H.264/AVC</h3>



<p>👍 –&nbsp; Almost universal playback compatibility with nearly 20 years in the field.&nbsp;</p>



<p>👎 –&nbsp; It’s almost 20 years old, and several newer codecs offer better compression and can produce higher quality video while using less data, providing a better viewing experience and reducing your long-term storage and delivery costs.&nbsp;</p>







<h3>H.265/HEVC</h3>



<p>👍 –&nbsp; MPEG’s successor to H.264/AVC can provide higher quality per bit and makes it possible to deliver HD,&nbsp; 4K and even 8K video to a wider audience, while using less bandwidth. H.265/HEVC is usually encoded with a higher bit depth than H.264/AVC, making high dynamic range (HDR) support possible, so most Dolby Vision streaming workflows use H.265/HEVC.</p>



<p>👎 – Royalty fees and complex licensing terms for H.265/HEVC have led some content creators and streaming services to avoid it. There are multiple patent pools, along with some individual companies that claim to own patents covering essential parts of the standard, creating uncertainty for end users around their liability and obligations.</p>







<h3>VP9&nbsp;</h3>



<p>👍 – Google’s open source VP9 is a royalty-free alternative to H.265/HEVC with similar performance in terms of compression efficiency. Platforms like YouTube and Facebook use VP9 to offer higher resolution video than H.264/AVC and improve video quality over low bandwidth, which is especially important for viewing on mobile devices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>👎 – VP9 is over 10 years old and while it is still widely used and supported, most of the current innovation and new development is focused on its successor, AV1.</p>







<h3>AV1</h3>



<p>👍 – AV1 offers the best compression performance of any of the codecs discussed here. On average it can achieve the same visual quality using ~50% less data than H.264/AVC and ~30% less data than H.265/HEVC and VP9. Those are significant savings that really add up over time and millions of views. YouTube and Netflix both use AV1 for their most popular HD and 4K content as a way to enable high-res viewing for people on slower connections, improving quality of experience and drastically reducing data usage, which lowers their egress and CDN costs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>👎 – Even though it’s a few years old, adoption of AV1 has been lagging behind initial expectations, mostly because of slower than expected rollout of playback and decoding support. Because of that, anyone encoding with AV1 will still need to provide backup H.264/AVC streams in the near future. However, recently launched products like the iPhone 15 Pro, Apple’s M3 desktop processor and the Meta Quest 3 headset all include AV1 decoding support, so hopefully the tide is turning and AV1 adoption will ramp up in the coming months.</p>

<h2>Why should I use newer codecs?</h2>



<p>In general, newer codecs provide better compression efficiency than their predecessors, using less bits to deliver the same level of quality. They can also support higher resolutions and wider color and contrast ranges than earlier generations. This has multiple benefits for streaming services and their viewers.</p>







<h3>Better visual quality at lower bitrates</h3>



<p>When delivering video to mobile phones, to viewers on shared, congested wifi or in areas with limited bandwidth, the tradeoff between quality and bitrate becomes especially apparent. This is where the compression performance of newer codecs can really stand out. Using a newer codec like AV1 can mean the difference between acceptable quality and a pixelated mess as you can see in the screenshot below from Facebook.</p>

<h3>Improved quality of experience and less buffering for all viewers</h3>



<p>It’s not just the low bitrate streams where newer codecs can improve quality of experience. The ability to deliver higher quality with less bits improves QoE across all adaptive bitrate renditions. At Demuxed 2023, Netflix reported that using AV1 not only reduced network bandwidth, but also lowered rebuffer rates and play start delay, while providing up to 38% reduction in quality drops compared to other codecs. They were also able to improve VMAF quality scores by up to 10 points with AV1.&nbsp;</p>







<h3>Higher resolutions and more advanced features</h3>



<p>H.264/AVC can technically be used for HD and 4K encoding, but you typically need extremely high bitrates to achieve the quality viewers expect from HD and UHD content. These higher bitrates can lead to more rebuffering and QoE issues, not to mention higher prices for storage and delivery. Most H.264/AVC workflows are limited to 8-bit encoding and decoding, which means it can’t really be used for HDR. H.265/HEVC, VP9 and AV1 can all handle 4K and 8K resolutions and support 10-bit and higher encoding, making them a better choice for premium content tiers. Netflix reported that using AV1 led to a 5% increase in 4K streaming time, so it can make a meaningful difference for the viewing experience and how your platform is perceived by users.&nbsp;</p>







<h3>Long term cost savings</h3>



<p>In addition to improving QoE, the better compression performance and lower bitrates required by newer codecs will also save you money over the lifetime of your video content. Even though the encoding is more complex and may cost a little more up front, the smaller file sizes can reduce your storage footprint and drastically cut your bandwidth on network egress and CDN delivery charges. For popular content receiving tens of thousands or millions of views, the overall savings can be substantial.</p>







<h2>Should I use more than one codec?</h2>



<p>This could potentially be another frustrating “It depends” question, but in most cases, the answer here is “Yes, you probably should”. Using H.264/AVC together with at least one newer codec ensures you have video that is backward compatible and available for everyone, while providing a higher quality viewing experience for those on newer devices with more advanced codec support. YouTube for example, encodes content in H.264/AVC, VP9 and AV1. Netflix uses H.264/AVC and AV1 for standard dynamic range content and H.265/HEVC for Dolby Vision. The right combination for your business will depend on your target viewing platforms, output quality, and business model. The step-by-step guide below will focus on AV1, but the same questions and steps could also be applied to other codecs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>







<h2>Step-by-step guide to adding AV1 encoding:</h2>







<h3>1. Determine how AV1 can help your business goals and viewer experience</h3>



<p>Adding a new codec can be beneficial in many ways as discussed above, but it’s a big decision and should be made with deliberate intentions and goals in mind. What is it that you want to achieve by adding a new codec to your encoding stack?&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>Quality improvement on mobile devices or areas with limited bandwidth?&nbsp;</li>



<li>Long term reduction of storage, egress, and CDN delivery costs?&nbsp;</li>



<li>Making premium 4K and HDR tiers available to a broader audience?&nbsp;</li>



<li>Improving QoE and reducing buffering across your platform?&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>AV1 can help in all of those areas, and you can fine tune your implementation to achieve your specific objectives.</p>







<h2>2. Project Total Cost of Ownership (TCO), savings and revenue potential</h2>



<p>AV1 is more complex to encode and can cost a little more in terms of computing power and encoding time. But the significant bandwidth savings it provides over H.264/AVC mean that in most cases, this initial cost will be more than offset by the longer term egress and CDN savings, giving you a lower TCO over the lifetime of each video. The actual break-even point will depend on your own contracts and delivery costs, so we created this <a href="https://bitmovin.com/demos/av1-break-even-calculator">calculator</a> to help forecast where you might begin to see overall savings by adding AV1.</p>

<p>Besides lowering TCO for your video, AV1 can actually help generate revenue and retain subscribers. Its lower bitrate requirements for HD and 4K content mean that it can grow your total addressable market for higher quality upsell tiers. It can also help reduce subscriber churn by lowering rebuffering rates and providing a generally better quality of experience for your viewers.&nbsp;</p>







<h2>3. Utilize cloud-native encoding and analytics for fast, risk-free evaluation</h2>



<p>Some on-premises encoders may require a pricey license upgrade to support AV1 encoding and in other cases, you’ll need to purchase a new appliance or hardware. You can avoid those high up-front costs that may stifle innovation by using a cloud encoding service that lets you pay on a usage basis. Even better, with Bitmovin’s <a href="https://bitmovin.com/encoding-service/cloud-native-advantage/">cloud-native</a> encoding, you can try it for free with our <a href="https://dashboard.bitmovin.com/signup?">30-day trial</a>.

<h2>4. Accelerate proof-of-concepts with content-aware, Per-Title Encoding</h2>



<p>AV1 is more complex to configure than previous generations of codecs and many technicians and engineers have spent years developing expertise with H.264, so there may be some reluctance or lack of time to fully dive into the details of a new codec configuration. You can overcome that obstacle by taking advantage of a content-aware encoding service, like Bitmovin’s <a href="https://bitmovin.com/encoding-service/per-title-encoding/">Per-Title Encoding</a>. Each file is automatically analyzed for complexity and the ideal adaptive bit-rate encoding ladder is generated for each piece of content, with no advanced knowledge or configuration of AV1 required. This not only simplifies the process, it will save you on storage costs by eliminating unnecessary renditions from your adaptive bitrate ladder and ensure you’re making the most efficient use of data on the delivery and playback side.&nbsp;</p>







<h2>5. Deploy with most popular content for early ROI&nbsp;</h2>



<p>One thing to keep in mind for AV1 deployment is that you don’t need to take an all-or-nothing approach. Some of the earliest adopters like YouTube and Netflix initially only encoded their most popular content with AV1, since that is where the delivery costs were highest and they could maximize their returns on the initial encoding investment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this <a href="https://www.analysysmason.com/netflix-open-connect" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">study</a> released by Netflix, analysts found that 21% of content streamed in one month in early 2022 benefited from the most recent improvements in codec efficiency (Per-Title HEVC and AV1). Without those improvements, they estimated that total Netflix traffic globally would have been around 24% higher. That’s a pretty solid proof point that using Per-Title AV1 with even a portion of your most popular content can make a big difference for overall data usage and cost. As of October 2023, Netflix reported that over 30% their catalog has now been encoded with AV1, with more being backfilled daily, and AV1 encoding is enabled for all new videos ingested to their platform. That shows they’ve now seen the value and potential benefits of AV1 make it worth adopting even beyond the most viewed content.&nbsp;</p>







<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>In a crowded marketplace where viewers have many options, taking advantage of newer codecs can help streaming services stand out with a better quality of experience for their viewers, while saving themselves money in the background. Which codecs provide the most benefit will depend on each service provider’s goals, business model and target devices, but it’s clear that evolving beyond H.264 alone is necessary to provide best-in-class streaming experiences. In addition to better quality, adding newer codecs like AV1 can help relieve the financial burden of higher egress and CDN costs that come with increased popularity. Making an investment in upgrading codecs now will pay dividends for years to come.&nbsp;</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="auto"><p>Every profession has its own dance with disaster. Physicians’ diagnosis, accountants’ audit, and writers? They proofread. But for us software developers, we engage in a peculiar kind of sorcery known as "debugging." It’s a delicate art that lets us wade through the rivers of time, witnessing the world through the eyes of a computer, understanding our coded creations at every step.</p><p>The Friday before it all began had an air of triumph about it. I leaned back in my swivel chair and announced to my boss with a confident smile, "The geolocated photos feature is ready to launch on Monday." I'd poured my coder's soul into our React Native mobile app, meticulously testing it on Android and the iOS beta - it seemed flawless. It wasn’t.</p><p>But what I'm about to tell you isn't just a story. It's a descent into a week-long abyss from 2016, when the magical toolset for debugging turned its back on me, leaving me to navigate the labyrinth of my own code, blind. This is a tale of digital ghosts in the machine, and the relentless hunt that ensued to exorcise them. It’s also a story about good people.</p><p>After releasing the Android beta, I was surprised and confused: the images simply wouldn't upload. A conundrum wrapped in an enigma, especially given the seamless performance on Android in the sanctuary of my local testing environment, not to mention the iOS beta that sprinted without so much as a hiccup.</p><p>I re-uploaded a version with improved error handling, but image uploads were failing without any feedback. You see, normally code screams its errors at you in red text - silence is the goal. Here silence was the problem.</p><p>Each new iteration of the app, laden with potential solutions, demanded an hour to upload to the Play Store before it could face judgment. Like clockwork, I uploaded new guesses while I prepared for the next. I was running out of ideas and under pressure to deliver.</p><p>By the second day, I was reminded that insanity is doing the same thing repeatedly and expecting different results. Nothing was working.</p><p>A kindred spirit, one of the embedded engineers approached me. "I know how you feel. I've been there."</p><p>"Oh?" I replied.</p><p>He explained, "We regularly ship firmware updates to remote equipment. Once in a while, a node would become unresponsive after an update."</p><p>Curious, I asked, "So how do you figure out what went wrong?"</p><p>He replied, "We have to remotely retrieve the equipment and have it sent back to us for analysis. Sometimes, it takes months to determine what might have gone wrong."</p><p>Realizing that my feedback loops were significantly shorter, I felt better knowing that at least I could put out a number of attempts each day. </p><p>By Wednesday, a seed of doubt had started growing in my mind. I started to question if software development was the right career path for me.</p><p>One of the sympathetic hardware engineers approached me. "I know how you feel. I've been there."</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>"We often release new hardware remotely, hoping it will remain functional for years. But sometimes design flaws in the hardware only become apparent after enduring multiple seasons. Things break."</p><p>"So, how do you figure out what went wrong?" I asked.</p><p>"We receive old equipment through the mail, and we attempt to incorporate fixes for the next generations. However, there are times when we add a feature and it turns out to be an even worse bug. One time we added ventilation holes to reduce heat, but they were just big enough for wasps to nest in. We can conduct tests in the lab, but the ultimate test is out in the field."</p><p>I started to realize how ambiguous problems were much more of a challenge. Maybe mobile development wasn’t so bad - at least my code either worked or didn’t.</p><p>By Thursday, I began to worry about my own job security. I had been spinning on a feature I said I would ship 3 days ago.</p><p>The CEO approached and sat down at my desk. I expected the worst. "I understand how you feel, I've been there”.</p><p>"Oh?" I asked, surprised.</p><p>"Before I started this company, I was a chemist working on my PhD dissertation," he explained. "I was granted a large amount of funding for an expensive chemical to conduct a series of experiments. But weeks into the experiments, it appeared that the results had failed due to experimental error."</p><p>"So, how did you figure out what went wrong?" I asked.</p><p>"I didn't.” My CEO continued, “When they asked me what I would do differently to prevent repeating the error, I couldn't even provide an answer. Somehow, and to my surprise, I still received the second round of funding."</p><p>I fully expected to be in trouble for delaying delivery. I’ve found few leaders demonstrate a level of empathy to bring you back up when you’re feeling down.</p><p>On Thursday evening, I went out for sushi with some friends and shared my recent frustration with them.</p><p>One of my veterinarian friends chimed in, "I know exactly how you feel. I had a similar problem today."</p><p>"Oh, really?" I asked.</p><p>She continued, "Earlier today, an owner brought in their elderly, sick dog. I suggested taking an x-ray, but the owner declined due to the cost."</p><p>"So, how did you figure out what was wrong with the dog?"</p><p>She replied, "The best I could do was feel the dog's stomach from the outside. I felt something large. We performed surgery to remove what turned out to be a corn cob, but without an x-ray, I can’t even be sure that was the extent of the problem."</p><p>For the past week, I had been hyper-focused on getting this mobile app out the door, as if nothing else mattered. But I needed to remind myself that, in the big picture, software development isn't usually about life-or-death situations. The stakes aren't typically that high.</p><p>By Friday morning, I noticed a discrepancy in the Android docs and my codebase. What had caused me to spin in circles for a week? A single character.</p><p>I sent a message to my friend, "Cracked it at last. It was the letter 'E'."</p><blockquote><p><span>For the curious, the image mime type was set to "jpg" but should have been"jpeg" - even though the files were saved as `.jpg`. (See </span><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33692835/is-the-mime-type-image-jpg-the-same-as-image-jpeg" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Stack Overflow</a><span> for details). </span></p></blockquote><p>She texted back, "Appreciate the update. I needed a bit of positivity today."</p><p>I frowned, puzzled. "Why, what's up?"</p><p>Her response was simple and somber: "The corn cob dog passed away this morning."</p><p>Perhaps software development wasn’t right for me, but it didn’t seem like other professions looked much better.</p><p>As software developers, it’s easy to overlook the privileges we enjoy. We have the unique ability to delve deep into intricate processes, monitor real-time activities, log what’s happening, and even pause time with a debugger. This remarkable capability is not only cheap but fast, bordering on thoughtless.</p><p>While many other professions struggle to understand and resolve their issues, we have the advantage of being able to experiment multiple times a day with just a few clicks. </p><p>I am grateful every day for the debugging tools that we have at our disposal.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>No one had ever seen one virus latching onto another virus, until anomalous sequencing results sent a UMBC team down a rabbit hole leading to a first-of-its-kind discovery.</p>



<p>It’s known that some viruses, called satellites, depend not only on their host organism to complete their life cycle, but also on another virus, known as a “helper,” explains<a href="https://erilllab.umbc.edu/"> <strong>Ivan Erill</strong></a>, professor of biological sciences. The satellite virus needs the helper either to build its capsid, a protective shell that encloses the virus’s genetic material, or to help it replicate its DNA. These viral relationships require the satellite and the helper to be in proximity to each other at least temporarily, but there were no known cases of a satellite actually attaching itself to a helper—until now.</p>



<p>In a paper <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41396-023-01548-0" rel="noopener">published in the <em>Journal of the International Society of Microbial Ecology</em></a>, a UMBC team and colleagues from Washington University in St. Louis (WashU) describe the first observation of a satellite bacteriophage (a virus that infects bacterial cells) consistently attaching to a helper bacteriophage at its “neck”—where the capsid joins the tail of the virus.</p>



<p>In detailed electron microscopy images taken by<a href="https://biology.umbc.edu/directory/faculty/person/od04934/"> <strong>Tagide deCarvalho</strong></a>, assistant director of the <a href="https://cnms.umbc.edu/core-facilities/">College of Natural and Mathematical Sciences core facilities</a> and first author on the new paper, 80 percent (40 out of 50) helpers had a satellite bound at the neck. Some of those that did not had remnant satellite tendrils present at the neck. Erill, senior author on the paper, describes them as appearing like “bite marks.”</p>



<p>“When I saw it, I was like, ‘I can’t believe this,’” deCarvalho says. “No one has ever seen a bacteriophage—or any other virus—attach to another virus.”</p>

<h4><strong>A long-term virus relationship</strong></h4>



<p>After the initial observations, <strong>Elia Mascolo</strong>, a graduate student in Erill‘s research group and co-first author on the paper, analyzed the genomes of the satellite, helper, and host, which revealed further clues about this never-before-seen viral relationship. Most satellite viruses contain a gene that allows them to integrate into the host cell’s genetic material after they enter the cell. This allows the satellite to reproduce whenever a helper happens to enter the cell from then on. The host cell also copies the satellite’s DNA along with its own when it divides.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="681" height="1024" src="https://umbc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Ivan_Erill_biology_6873-1-681x1024.jpg" alt="headshot of man in blue-gray t-shirt, greenery in background." srcset="https://umbc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Ivan_Erill_biology_6873-1-681x1024.jpg 681w, https://umbc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Ivan_Erill_biology_6873-1-199x300.jpg 199w, https://umbc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Ivan_Erill_biology_6873-1-768x1155.jpg 768w, https://umbc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Ivan_Erill_biology_6873-1-1021x1536.jpg 1021w, https://umbc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Ivan_Erill_biology_6873-1.jpg 1290w" sizes="(max-width: 681px) 100vw, 681px"><figcaption>Ivan Erill co-leads the SEA-PHAGES program at UMBC.

<p>A bacteriophage sample from WashU also contained a helper and a satellite. The WashU satellite has a gene for integration and does not directly attach to its helper, similar to previously observed satellite-helper systems.</p>



<p>However, the satellite in UMBC’s sample, named MiniFlayer by the students who isolated it, is the first known case of a satellite with no gene for integration. Because it can’t integrate into the host cell’s DNA, it must be near its helper—named MindFlayer—every time it enters a host cell if it is going to survive. Given that, although the team did not directly prove this explanation, “Attaching now made total sense,” Erill says, “because otherwise, how are you going to guarantee that you are going to enter into the cell at the same time?”</p>



<p>Additional bioinformatics analysis by Mascolo and <strong>Julia López-Pérez</strong>, another Ph.D. student working with Erill, revealed that MindFlayer and MiniFlayer have been co-evolving for a long time. “This satellite has been tuning in and optimizing its genome to be associated with the helper for, I would say, at least 100 million years,” Erill says, which suggests there may be many more cases of this kind of relationship waiting to be discovered.</p>



<h4><strong>Contamination or discovery?</strong></h4>



<p>This groundbreaking discovery could easily have been missed. The project started out as a typical semester in the SEA-PHAGES program—an investigative curriculum where undergraduates isolate bacteriophages from environmental samples, send them out for sequencing, and then use bioinformatics tools to analyze the results. When the sequencing lab at the University of Pittsburgh reported contamination in the sample from UMBC expected to contain the MindFlayer phage, the journey began.</p>

He also conducts pedagogy research to improve science education. (Marlayna Demond ’11/UMBC)</figcaption></figure>



<p>The sample included one large sequence: the phage they expected. “But instead of just finding that, we also found a small sequence, which didn’t map to anything we knew,” says Erill, who is also one of the leads for<a href="https://umbc.edu/stories/phage-hunters-popular-umbc-research-program-opens-doors-to-biotech-careers/"> UMBC’s SEA-PHAGES program, called Phage Hunters</a>, along with<a href="https://biology.umbc.edu/directory/faculty/person/rm45122/"> <strong>Steven Caruso</strong></a>, principal lecturer of biological sciences. Caruso ’94, Ph.D. ’02, biological sciences, ran the isolation again, sent it out for sequencing—and got identical results.</p>



<p>That’s when the team pulled in deCarvalho to get a visual of what was going on with the transmission electron microscope (TEM) at UMBC’s<a href="https://kpif.umbc.edu/"> Keith R. Porter Imaging Facility</a> (KPIF). Without the images, the discovery would have been impossible.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Not everyone has a TEM at their disposal,” deCarvalho notes. But with the instruments at the KPIF, deCarvalho says, “I’m able to follow up on some of these observations and validate them with imaging. There’s elements of discovery we can only make using the TEM.”</p>



<p>The team’s discovery sets the stage for future work to figure out how the satellite attaches, how common this phenomenon is, and much more. “It’s possible that a lot of the bacteriophages that people thought were contaminated were actually these satellite-helper systems,” deCarvalho says. “So now, with this paper, people might be able to recognize more of these systems.”</p>

        The African Union also established the African Continental Free Trade Area, a free trade area spanning the whole continent with an estimated value of $3.4 trillion. Its goals are to promote economic growth and provide a single, united market for the 1.3 billion people living on the continent.

Large operations were carefully planned.  You wouldn't overlook the power requirements of a few racks being added -- there'd -- literally[0] -- be no place to plug them in without an electrician being brought in.  However, in a 3-month period every once in a while, two racks would have old devices replaced either due to failure or refresh, one at a time.</p><p>Since they weren't plugged directly into rack batteries (we had two battery rooms providing DC-wide battery backup), the overload wouldn't trip.  Since we were still below the capacity of the circuit, the breaker(s) wouldn't trip.  And maybe we're still under capacity for our backup system, but a few of the batteries are under-performing.</p><p>I think the lesson we learned when this happened was: you need to "actually test" the thing.  My understanding is that our tests were of the individual components in isolation.  We'd load test the batteries and the generator and then the relays between.  At the end of the day, though, if you don't cut the power and see what happens you don't truly know.  And my understanding is that having that final step in place resulted in a large number of additional tests being devised "of the individual components" that ensured they never had an outage like that, again.</p><p>[0] Guessing it's common practice to make "finding a f!cking power outlet" nearly impossible in DC.  Every rack had exactly the number of leads it needed for the hardware plugged into a completely full receptacle.  They rolled around a cart with a monitor, printer, label printer, keyboard, mouse and a huge UPS on it so staff could do daily maintenance work.

We had a diesel generator and a couple of (bathroom sized) rooms full of (what looked like) car batteries.  My understanding is that the two rooms were for redundancy.  The batteries could power the DC for hours but were used only until the generator was ready.<p>The area our DC was located in was impressively reliable power-wise and -- in fact -- the backup systems had managed through the multi-state power outage in the early 2000s without a hitch (short of nearly running out of fuel due to our fuel supplier being ... just a little overwhelmed).</p><p>A few years later a two minute power outage caused the DC to go dark for a full day.  Upon the power failing, the batteries kicked in and a few minutes after that the generator fired up and the DC went into holy terror.</p><p>About a minute after the generator kicked in, power to the DC blinked and ended.  The emergency lights kicked in, the evacuate alarm sounded[0] and panic ensued.</p><p>My very pedestrian understanding of the problem was that a few things failed -- when the generator kicked in, something didn't switch power correctly, then something else didn't trip in response to that, a set of 4 batteries caught fire (and destroyed several nearby).  They were extinguished by our facilities manager with a nearby fire extinguisher.  He, incidentally, was the one who pulled the alarm (which wouldn't, on its own, trigger the Halon system, I think).  The remainder of the day was spent dealing with the aftermath.</p><p>We were a global multi-national telecom with a mess of procedures in place for this sort of thing.  Everything was installed by electricians, to very exacting standards[1] but -- as with most things "backup" -- the way it was tested and the frequency of those tests was inadequate.</p><p>From that point forward (going on over a decade) they thoroughly tested the battery/generator backup once a quarter.</p><p>[0] We were warned to GTFO if that alarm goes off due to the flooding of chemicals that would follow a few minutes later.  That didn't happen.</p><p>[1] I remember the DC manager taking over in Cleveland making his staff work weeks of overtime replacing zip ties with wax lace (and it was done NASA style).  We're talking thousands and thousands of runs stretching two complete floors of a skyscraper.

Backup systems in those datacenters responded as designed, resulting in no loss of power or customer impact. At 7:24pm PDT, a large voltage spike was experienced by the electrical switching equipment in two of the US East-1 datacenters supporting a single Availability Zone. All utility electrical switches in both datacenters initiated transfer to generator power. In one of the datacenters, the transfer completed without incident. In the other, the generators started successfully, but each generator independently failed to provide stable voltage as they were brought into service. As a result, the generators did not pick up the load and servers operated without interruption during this period on the Uninterruptable Power Supply (“UPS”) units. Shortly thereafter, utility power was restored and our datacenter personnel transferred the datacenter back to utility power. The utility power in the Region failed a second time at 7:57pm PDT. Again, all rooms of this one facility failed to successfully transfer to generator power while all of our other datacenters in the Region continued to operate without customer impact.</p><p>&gt; The generators and electrical switching equipment in the datacenter that experienced the failure were all the same brand and all installed in late 2010 and early 2011. Prior to installation in this facility, the generators were rigorously tested by the manufacturer. At datacenter commissioning time, they again passed all load tests (approximately 8 hours of testing) without issue. On May 12th of this year, we conducted a full load test where the entire datacenter switched to and ran successfully on these same generators, and all systems operated correctly. The generators and electrical equipment in this datacenter are less than two years old, maintained by manufacturer representatives to manufacturer standards, and tested weekly. In addition, these generators operated flawlessly, once brought online Friday night, for just over 30 hours until utility power was restored to this datacenter. The equipment will be repaired, recertified by the manufacturer, and retested at full load onsite or it will be replaced entirely. In the interim, because the generators ran successfully for 30 hours after being manually brought online, we are confident they will perform properly if the load is transferred to them. Therefore, prior to completing the engineering work mentioned above, we will lengthen the amount of time the electrical switching equipment gives the generators to reach stable power before the switch board assesses whether the generators are ready to accept the full power load. Additionally, we will expand the power quality tolerances allowed when evaluating whether to switch the load to generator power. We will expand the size of the onsite 24x7 engineering staff to ensure that if there is a repeat event, the switch to generator will be completed manually (if necessary) before UPSs discharge and there is any customer impact.

This is the basis on which BGP announcements are typically filtered.</p><p>&gt; what is the alternative architecture that prevents IP address spoofing?</p><p>It is possible to extend the same filtering approaches used with BGP to actual traffic forwarding without making fundamental architectural changes.  See BCP38 (access) and BCP84 (peering).  Widespread adoption of these would eliminate IP spoofing.

Local company had a NOC and power went out in the area. They had moved into the build a long time ago and had two backup generators at the back end of the parking lot already installed. Power goes out, generator didn't start. 2nd generator started but it was now undersized and immediately tripped the breaker. First generator tried to start and it failed again.<p>Another local company had a backup generator in the basement. They were doing maintenance work on the power and messed up so the generator kicked in. Since it was in the basement, they had a belt to drive an exhaust fan. Generator kicked on, fan belt snapped, exhaust filled the entire basement, rolled into the service elevator, starts coming out the 3rd floor (top of the service elevator) and the building was then evacuated.</p><p>Last generator story, small IT shop with a small colo in the 2000s moved into a new building and got a natural gas generator installed with it running a self diagnostic once a month. Power goes out in the first month, lights go out, generator kicks on, lights come back, lights go back off. Turns out that the electrician didn't have a 60amp breaker that day and put in a 20 amp breaker for a 60+ amp generator. They meant to come back out and fix it and never did.

I remember one where they’d tested the generator but only for like a couple of minutes each month and so the fuel in the tank was really old by the time there was a real outage and the generator clogged expensively about an hour in, right as people were relaxing and thinking it’d be smooth sailing until the main power line was restored.

One example of the approach is the separate top-level domain usually used.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="MakeItRegularArticle-ArticleBody-5" data-module="ArticleBody" data-test="articleBody-1" data-analytics="MakeItRegularArticle-articleBody-5-1"><div><p>As workers reconsider their work-life balance post-pandemic, 92% of young people say that they would make sacrifices in exchange for a four-day workweek, <a href="https://www.bankrate.com/personal-finance/younger-workers-want-four-day-workweek/" target="_blank">according to a new Bankrate survey</a>.</p><p>"Younger generations have obviously lived through major economic events like the coronavirus pandemic, which blurred the lines between where you work, how you work, how much time you spend doing it," Sarah Foster, a Bankrate analyst, tells CNBC Make It. "That coupled with this still <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/03/the-job-market-is-strong-economists-say-but-workers-dont-think-so-.html">historically strong job market</a> … is giving them the leverage to bargain for what they want."</p><p>While the five-day schedule remains the standard in the U.S., 22% of U.S. workers anticipate that four-day workweeks will be the norm in their industry within the next five years. And the sacrifices that younger employees are willing to make might help change the tides.</p></div><h2><a id="headline0"></a>The concessions younger workers are willing to make</h2><div><p>Despite the popular belief that younger generations are champions of remote work, one-third of Gen Z and millennial workers say they'd be willing to work fully in-person if it meant shaving a day off of their workweek.</p><p>"If a company wants to bring younger workers back [into the office], maybe this is the perk they should look into," says Foster.</p><p>Other sacrifices that Gen Z and millennial employees say they'd make in exchange for a four-day workweek include working longer hours (48%), changing jobs or companies (35%), working weekends or evenings (27%) and even taking a pay cut (13%).&nbsp;</p><p>The Bankrate data is a sign that younger generations are prioritizing work-life balance and "recognizing that flexibility itself is a job perk," Foster says.&nbsp;</p><p>Older generations also show a strong interest in the four-day workweek, with over 86% of Gen X and baby boomer workers saying that they'd be willing to give something up in exchange for a shorter week.&nbsp;</p><p>There is one sacrifice that older workers are more inclined to make when compared with Gen Z and millennial workers: 61% say they would work longer hours to attain a four-day workweek.</p><p>But Gen Xers and baby boomers trail behind younger workers in other concessions they'd be willing to make, likely due to the fact that they've worked five-day schedules for most of their careers.&nbsp;</p><p>"Older generations, they've gotten in the habit of working these schedules, they know life before the coronavirus pandemic," says Foster. "There's something to be said about maybe not wanting to pursue that taste of flexibility the way that younger generations probably do."</p></div><h2><a id="headline1"></a>What will it take for four-day workweeks to become the norm?</h2><div><p>The 40-hour workweek has been commonplace <a href="https://www.dol.gov/general/aboutdol/history/flsa1938" target="_blank">since the Great Depression</a>, so it's hardly a surprise that employers remain resistant to change — in 2023, only <a href="https://www.adpri.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/People-at-Work-2023-A-Global-Workforce-View-1.pdf" target="_blank">15% of U.S. workers</a> say their employer offers a four-day workweek to promote positive mental health, according to payroll analysis company ADP.</p><p>While it would likely take government intervention to introduce widespread change, a rise in workers showing interest in companies that currently offer four-day workweeks could help drive a shift, Foster says.</p><p>"Once some companies start offering [four-day workweeks] and once many workers start to apply for those positions … it might actually end up putting more pressure on companies to introduce this non-traditional perk," she says.&nbsp;</p><p>While workers wanting a four-day workweek probably have the best luck looking for positions within companies that already offer it, employees pining for this perk within their employer should broach workweek conversations like they do pay negotiations, Foster says.&nbsp;</p><p>"It makes sense to think of the business case for switching to this schedule and the way it could help the bottom line of your company," she says. "Speaking your company's language could be the best step to secure more work-life balance, but it might end up being a baby step."</p><p>If you're going to initiate conversations around more flexible schedules, now might be the right time — Foster says workers should capitalize on the bargaining power they're seeing from the robust job market while it lasts.&nbsp;</p><p>"I would say that now is really the time to start looking into more flexible options and use this strong job market to your advantage while you can," she says.</p><p><em><strong>DON'T MISS: Want to be smarter and more successful with your money, work &amp; life?&nbsp;</strong></em><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/makeitnewsletter/"><em><strong>Sign up for our new newsletter!</strong></em></a></p><p><em>As technology reshapes business expectations, some leaders are embracing change and transforming their organizations for the future.

<p dir="auto">To run the model you need Python 3.7+</p>
<p dir="auto">If you don't have PyTorch installed. Follow their instructions <a href="https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Install the package <code>pix2tex</code>:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="pip install &quot;pix2tex[gui]&quot;"><pre><code>pip install "pix2tex[gui]"
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Model checkpoints will be downloaded automatically.</p>
<p dir="auto">There are three ways to get a prediction from an image.</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">You can use the command line tool by calling <code>pix2tex</code>. Here you can parse already existing images from the disk and images in your clipboard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/katie-lim">@katie-lim</a>, you can use a nice user interface as a quick way to get the model prediction. Just call the GUI with <code>latexocr</code>. From here you can take a screenshot and the predicted latex code is rendered using <a href="https://www.mathjax.org/" rel="nofollow">MathJax</a> and copied to your clipboard.</p>
<p dir="auto">Under linux, it is possible to use the GUI with <code>gnome-screenshot</code> (which comes with multiple monitor support) if <code>gnome-screenshot</code> was installed beforehand. For Wayland, <code>grim</code> and <code>slurp</code> will be used when they are both available. Note that <code>gnome-screenshot</code> is not compatible with wlroots-based Wayland compositors. Since <code>gnome-screenshot</code> will be preferred when available, you may have to set the environment variable <code>SCREENSHOT_TOOL</code> to <code>grim</code> in this case (other available values are <code>gnome-screenshot</code> and <code>pil</code>).</p>

<p dir="auto">The model works best with images of smaller resolution. That's why I added a preprocessing step where another neural network predicts the optimal resolution of the input image. This model will automatically resize the custom image to best resemble the training data and thus increase performance of images found in the wild. Still it's not perfect and might not be able to handle huge images optimally, so don't zoom in all the way before taking a picture.</p>
<p dir="auto">Always double check the result carefully. You can try to redo the prediction with an other resolution if the answer was wrong.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main"><article><header></header><p>I've used <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">a</a> <a href="https://gohugo.io/">lot</a>
<a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">of</a> <a href="https://www.getzola.org/">static</a>
<a href="https://nextjs.org/">site</a> <a href="https://astro.build/">generators</a> in the past and
they all have their own features and quirks, but most importantly you have to
architect your website to match what the framework expects.</p>
<p>Since yesterday this website is powered by my own SSG<sup><a href="#fn-1" id="fnref-1" data-footnote-ref="">1</a></sup>.
It's not meant to be reusable, it's just normal code—parsing and generating
files for this specific website.</p>
<p>And oh boy do I love it.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2>Why??</h2>
<p>When Vercel released <a href="https://nextjs.org/blog/next-14">Next.js 14</a> recently,
some friends I've talked to where still on Next.js 12 and really felt the
pressure to upgrade to not fall behind even more.
This made me think about the longevity and robustness of my website and so I
decided I don't want to depend on other people's decisions and run after version
upgrades I don't care about.</p>
<p>And even if your content is Markdown and media, almost everything around it
needs to be updated when switching frameworks—sometimes even when upgrading.
When I used Astro before, I wanted to statically generate OG images and, after
some research, managed to build it and even wrote
<a href="https://arne.me/articles/static-og-images-in-astro">an article</a> explaining how.
You loose all of this custom logic.</p>
<p>Plus, you get to choose your own stack.
Want to write your content in AsciiDoc? No-one can stop you!</p>
<p>I know what you're thinking and you're right, it's <em>way</em> more work than using
something that already exists.
But it's also so much more fun.
You can do anything with this, and you don't need to read documentation or try
to understand other people's architectural decisions—just start writing code!</p>
<h2>Okay, tell me how you did it</h2>
<p>After contemplating to build something dynamic<sup><a href="#fn-2" id="fnref-2" data-footnote-ref="">2</a></sup> for search without
JavaScript, I decided to stay with a static site.
It's faster and you don't have to worry about security or stability.
And of course I choose the best programming language on the planet, Rust (my
beloved).
Wait, come back, this is not a Rust post!</p>
<p>A static site generator mostly needs to do five things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Convert markdown to HTML</li>
<li>Render HTML templates</li>
<li>Compile CSS</li>
<li>Generate RSS feeds</li>
<li>Generate a sitemap</li>
</ol>
<p>And of these you might not even need the last three.
Surely your favourite programming language has a Markdown parser and a
templating engine.</p>
<p>For Rust I chose these crates<sup><a href="#fn-3" id="fnref-3" data-footnote-ref="">3</a></sup>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://crates.io/crates/comrak">comrak</a> and <a href="https://crates.io/crates/gray_matter">gray_matter</a> for parsing Markdown and the frontmatter</li>
<li><a href="https://maud.lambda.xyz/">maud</a> for compile-time templates</li>
<li><a href="https://crates.io/crates/grass">grass</a> for SCSS compilation</li>
<li><a href="https://crates.io/crates/rss">rss</a> for (you guessed it) generating RSS feeds</li>
<li><a href="https://crates.io/crates/quick-xml">quick-xml</a> for generating the sitemap</li>
</ul>
<p>Once I got the tools I needed, I just started writing software.
I built something to parse my content, something to render all the different
templates I needed, something to generate the RSS, something to generate a
sitemap and…that's it, really!</p>
<p>And when it's time to add OG images to this website, I can choose the best
libraries and just build it.</p>
<h2>What now?</h2>
<p>I hope this article left you either validated that rolling your own not worth it
and you want to keep using a framework or interested to see what's on the other
side.</p>
<p>If you're in the latter camp, you can check out the
<a href="https://github.com/bahlo/arne.me">source of this website</a> to get some
inspiration.
But most importantly: Choose a tech stack that excites you and have fun!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 id="Summary">Summary</h2>

This will allow stream pipelines to transform data in ways that are not easily achievable with the existing built-in intermediate operations. This is a <a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/12">preview API</a>.</p>
<h2 id="Goals">Goals</h2>

<p>Make stream pipelines more flexible and expressive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Insofar as possible, allow custom intermediate operations to manipulate streams of infinite size.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Non-Goals">Non-Goals</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It is not a goal to change the Java programming language to better facilitate stream processing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is not a goal to special-case the compilation of code that uses the Stream&nbsp;API.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>Java 8 introduced the first API designed specifically for lambda expressions: the Stream API, <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/util/stream/package-summary.html"><code>java.util.stream</code></a>. A stream is a lazily computed, potentially unbounded sequence of values. The API supports the ability to process a stream either sequentially or in parallel.</p>
<p>A <em>stream pipeline</em> consists of three parts: a source of elements, any number of intermediate operations, and a terminal operation. For example:</p>
<pre><code>long numberOfWords =
    Stream.of("the", "", "fox", "jumps", "over", "the", "", "dog")  // (1)
          .filter(Predicate.not(String::isEmpty))                   // (2)
          .collect(Collectors.counting());                          // (3)</code></pre>
<p>This programming style is both expressive and efficient. With the builder-style API, each intermediate operation returns a new stream; evaluation begins only when a terminal operation is invoked. In this example, line (1) creates a stream, but does not evaluate it, line (2) sets up an intermediate <code>filter</code> operation but still does not evaluate the stream, and finally the terminal <code>collect</code> operation on line (3) evaluates the entire stream pipeline.</p>
<p>The Stream API provides a reasonably rich, albeit fixed, set of intermediate and terminal operations: mapping, filtering, reduction, sorting, and so forth. It also includes an extensible terminal operation, <code>Stream::collect</code>, which enables the output of a pipeline to be summarized in a variety of ways.</p>
<p>The use of streams in the Java ecosystem is by now pervasive, and ideal for many tasks, but the fixed set of intermediate operations means that some complex tasks cannot easily be expressed as stream pipelines. Either a required intermediate operation does not exist, or it exists but does not directly support the task.</p>
<p>As an example, suppose the task is to take a stream of strings and make it distinct, but with distinctness based on string length rather than content. That is, at most one string of length 1 should be emitted, and at most one string of length 2, and at most one string of length 3, and so forth. Ideally, the code would look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>var result = Stream.of("foo", "bar", "baz", "quux")
                   .distinctBy(String::length)      // Hypothetical
                   .toList();

// result ==&gt; [foo, quux]</code></pre>
<p>Unfortunately, <code>distinctBy</code> is not a built-in intermediate operation. The closest built-in operation, <code>distinct</code>, tracks the elements it has already seen by using object equality to compare them. That is, <code>distinct</code> is stateful but in this case uses the wrong state: We want it to track elements based on equality of string length, not string content. We could work around this limitation by declaring a class that defines object equality in terms of string length, wrapping each string in an instance of that class and applying <code>distinct</code> to those instances. This expression of the task is not intuitive, however, and makes for code that is difficult to maintain:</p>
<pre><code>record DistinctByLength(String str) {

    @Override public boolean equals(Object obj) {
        return obj instanceof DistinctByLength(String other)
               &amp;&amp; str.length() == other.length();
    }

    @Override public int hashCode() {
        return str == null ? 0 : Integer.hashCode(str.length());
    }

}

var result = Stream.of("foo", "bar", "baz", "quux")
                   .map(DistinctByLength::new)
                   .distinct()
                   .map(DistinctByLength::str)
                   .toList();

// result ==&gt; [foo, quux]</code></pre>
<p>As another example, suppose the task is to group elements into fixed-size groups of three, but retain only the first two groups: <code>[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ...]</code> should produce <code>[[0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5]]</code>. Ideally, the code would look like this:</p>
<pre><code>var result = Stream.iterate(0, i -&gt; i + 1)
                   .windowFixed(3)                  // Hypothetical
                   .limit(2)
                   .toList();

// result ==&gt; [[0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5]]</code></pre>
<p>Unfortunately, no built-in intermediate operation supports this task. The best option is to place the fixed-window grouping logic in the terminal operation, by invoking <code>collect</code> with a custom <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/util/stream/Collector.html"><code>Collector</code></a>. However, we must precede the <code>collect</code> operation with a fixed-size <code>limit</code> operation, since the collector cannot signal to <code>collect</code> that it is finished while new elements are appearing — which happens forever with an infinite stream. Also, the task is inherently about ordered data, so it is not feasible to have the collector perform grouping in parallel, and it must signal this fact by throwing an exception if its combiner is invoked. The resulting code is difficult to understand:</p>
<pre><code>var result

<p>Over the years, many new intermediate operations have been suggested for the Stream API. Most of them make sense when considered in isolation, but adding all of them would make the (already large) Stream API more difficult to learn because its operations would be less discoverable.</p>
<p>The designers of the Stream API understood that it would be desirable to have an <a href="https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8132369">extension point</a> so that anyone could define intermediate stream operations. At the time, however, they did not know what that extension point should look like. It eventually became clear that the extension point for terminal operations, namely <code>Stream::collect(Collector)</code>, was effective. We can now take a similar approach for intermediate operations.</p>
<p>In summary, more intermediate operations create more situational value, making streams a better fit for even more tasks. We should provide an API for custom intermediate operations that allows developers to transform finite and infinite streams in their preferred ways.</p>
<h2 id="Description">Description</h2>
<p><a href="https://cr.openjdk.org/~vklang/gatherers/api/java.base/java/util/stream/Gatherer.html"><code>Stream::gather(Gatherer)</code></a> is a new intermediate stream operation that processes the elements of a stream by applying a user-defined entity called a <em>gatherer</em>. With the <code>gather</code> operation we can build efficient, parallel-ready streams that implement almost any intermediate operation.  <code>Stream::gather(Gatherer)</code> is to intermediate operations what <code>Stream::collect(Collector)</code> is to terminal operations.</p>
<p>A <em>gatherer</em> represents a transform of the elements of a stream; it is an instance of the <a href="https://cr.openjdk.org/~vklang/gatherers/api/java.base/java/util/stream/Gatherer.html"><code>java.util.stream.Gatherer</code></a> interface. Gatherers can transform elements in a one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one, or many-to-many fashion. They can track previously seen elements in order to influence the transformation of later elements, they can short-circuit in order to transform infinite streams to finite ones, and they can enable parallel execution. For example, a gatherer can transform one input element to one output element until some condition becomes true, at which time it starts to transform one input element to two output elements.</p>
<p>A gatherer is defined by four functions that work together:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The optional <em>initializer</em> function provides an object that maintains private state while processing stream elements. For example, a gatherer can store the current element so that, the next time it is applied, it can compare the new element with the now-previous element and, say, emit only the larger of the two. In effect, such a gatherer transforms two input elements into one output element.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <em>integrator</em> function integrates a new element from the input stream, possibly inspecting the private state object and possibly emitting elements to the output stream. It can also terminate processing before reaching the end of the input stream; for example, a gatherer searching for the largest of a stream of integers can terminate if it detects <code>Integer.MAX_VALUE</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The optional <em>combiner</em> function can be used to evaluate the gatherer in parallel when the input stream is marked as parallel. If a gatherer is not parallel-capable then it can still be part of a parallel stream pipeline, but it is evaluated sequentially. This is useful for cases where an operation is inherently ordered in nature and thus cannot be parallelized.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The optional <em>finisher</em> function is invoked when there are no more input elements to consume. This function can inspect the private state object and, possibly, emit additional output elements. For example, a gatherer searching for a specific element amongst its input elements can report failure, say by throwing an exception, when its finisher is invoked.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When invoked, <code>Stream::gather</code> performs the equivalent of the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Create a <a href="https://cr.openjdk.org/~vklang/gatherers/api/java.base/java/util/stream/Gatherer.Downstream.html"><code>Downstream</code></a> object which, when given an element of the gatherer’s output type, passes it to the next stage in the pipeline.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Obtain the gatherer’s private state object by invoking the <code>get()</code> method of its <a href="https://cr.openjdk.org/~vklang/gatherers/api/java.base/java/util/stream/Gatherer.html#initializer()">initializer</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Obtain the gatherer’s <a href="https://cr.openjdk.org/~vklang/gatherers/api/java.base/java/util/stream/Gatherer.Integrator.html">integrator</a> by invoking its <a href="https://cr.openjdk.org/~vklang/gatherers/api/java.base/java/util/stream/Gatherer.html#integrator()"><code>integrator()</code></a> method.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While there are more input elements, invoke the integrator's <a href="https://cr.openjdk.org/~vklang/gatherers/api/java.base/java/util/stream/Gatherer.Integrator.html#integrate(A,T,java.util.stream.Gatherer.Downstream)">integrate(...)</a> method, passing it the state object, the next element, and the downstream object. Terminate if that method returns <code>false</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Obtain the gatherer’s <a href="https://cr.openjdk.org/~vklang/gatherers/api/java.base/java/util/stream/Gatherer.html#finisher()">finisher</a> and invoke it with the state and downstream objects.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Every existing intermediate operation declared in the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/util/stream/Stream.html"><code>Stream</code></a> interface can be implemented by invoking <code>gather</code> with a gatherer that implements that operation. For example, given a stream of <code>T</code>-typed elements, <code>Stream::map</code> turns each <code>T</code> element into a <code>U</code> element by applying a function and then passes the <code>U</code> element downstream; this is simply a stateless one-to-one gatherer. As another example, <code>Stream::filter</code> takes a predicate that determines whether an input element should be passed downstream; this is simply a stateless one-to-many gatherer. In fact every stream pipeline is, conceptually, equivalent to</p>
<pre><code>source.gather(...).gather(...).gather(...).collect(...)</code></pre>
<h3 id="Built-in-gatherers">Built-in gatherers</h3>
<p>We introduce the following built-in gatherers in the <a href="https://cr.openjdk.org/~vklang/gatherers/api/java.base/java/util/stream/Gatherers.html">java.util.stream.Gatherers</a> class:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://cr.openjdk.org/~vklang/gatherers/api/java.base/java/util/stream/Gatherers.html#fold(java.util.function.Supplier,java.util.function.BiFunction)"><code>fold</code></a> is a stateful many-to-one gatherer which constructs an aggregate incrementally and emits that aggregate when no more input elements exist.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://cr.openjdk.org/~vklang/gatherers/api/java.base/java/util/stream/Gatherers.html#mapConcurrent(int,java.util.function.Function)"><code>mapConcurrent</code></a> is a stateful one-to-one gatherer which invokes a supplied function for each input element concurrently, up to a supplied limit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://cr.openjdk.org/~vklang/gatherers/api/java.base/java/util/stream/Gatherers.html#scan(java.util.function.Supplier,java.util.function.BiFunction)"><code>scan</code></a> is a stateful one-to-one gatherer which applies a supplied function to the current state and the current element to produce the next element, which it passes downstream.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://cr.openjdk.org/~vklang/gatherers/api/java.base/java/util/stream/Gatherers.html#windowFixed(int)"><code>windowFixed</code></a> is a stateful many-to-many gatherer which groups input elements into lists of a supplied size, emitting the windows downstream when they are full.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://cr.openjdk.org/~vklang/gatherers/api/java.base/java/util/stream/Gatherers.html#windowSliding(int)"><code>windowSliding</code></a> is a stateful many-to-many gatherer which groups input elements into lists of a supplied size. After the first window, each subsequent window is created from a copy of its predecessor by dropping the first element and appending the next element from the input stream..</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Parallel-evaluation">Parallel evaluation</h3>
<p>Parallel evaluation of a gatherer is split into two distinct modes. When a combiner is not provided, the stream library can still extract parallelism by executing upstream and downstream operations in parallel, analogous to a short-circuitable <code>parallel().forEachOrdered()</code> operation. When a combiner is provided, parallel evaluation is analogous to a short-circuitable <code>parallel().reduce()</code> operation.</p>
<h3 id="Composing-gatherers">Composing gatherers</h3>
<p>Gatherers support composition via the <a href="https://cr.openjdk.org/~vklang/gatherers/api/java.base/java/util/stream/Gatherer.html#andThen(java.util.stream.Gatherer)"><code>andThen(Gatherer)</code></a> method, which joins two gatherers where the first produces elements that the second can consume.  This enables the creation of sophisticated gatherers by composing simpler ones, just like <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/util/function/Function.html#andThen(java.util.function.Function)">function composition</a>.  Semantically,</p>
<pre><code>source.gather(a).gather(b).gather(c).collect(...)</code></pre>
<p>is equivalent to</p>
<pre><code>source.gather(a.andThen(b).andThen(c)).collect(...)</code></pre>
<h3 id="Gatherers-vs--collectors">Gatherers vs. collectors</h3>
<p>The design of the <code>Gatherer</code> interface is heavily influenced by the design of <code>Collector</code>. The main differences are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>Gatherer</code> uses an <a href="https://cr.openjdk.org/~vklang/gatherers/api/java.base/java/util/stream/Gatherer.Integrator.html"><code>Integrator</code></a> instead of a <a href="https://cr.openjdk.org/~vklang/gatherers/api/java.base/java/util/function/BiConsumer.html"><code>BiConsumer</code></a> for per-element processing because it needs an extra input parameter for the <a href="https://cr.openjdk.org/~vklang/gatherers/api/java.base/java/util/stream/Gatherer.Downstream.html"><code>Downstream</code></a> object, and because it needs to return a <code>boolean</code> to indicate whether processing should continue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Gatherer</code> uses a <a href="https://cr.openjdk.org/~vklang/gatherers/api/java.base/java/util/function/BiConsumer.html"><code>BiConsumer</code></a> for its finisher instead of a <a href="https://cr.openjdk.org/~vklang/gatherers/api/java.base/java/util/function/Function.html"><code>Function</code></a> because it needs an extra input parameter for its <a href="https://cr.openjdk.org/~vklang/gatherers/api/java.base/java/util/stream/Gatherer.Downstream.html"><code>Downstream</code></a> object, and because it cannot return a result and thus is <code>void</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Example:-Embracing-the-stream">Example: Embracing the stream</h3>
<p>Sometimes the lack of an appropriate intermediate operation forces us to evaluate a stream into a list and run our analysis logic in a loop. Suppose, for example, that we have a stream of temporally ordered temperature readings:</p>
<pre><code>record Reading(Instant obtainedAt, int degreesK) {

    Reading(String time, int degreesK) {
        this(Instant.parse(time), degreesK);
    }

    static Stream&lt;Reading&gt; loadRecentReadings() {
        // In reality these could be read from a file, a database,
        // a service, or otherwise
        return Stream.of(
                new Reading("2023-09-21T10:15:30.00Z", 310),
                new Reading("2023-09-21T10:15:31.00Z", 312),
                new Reading("2023-09-21T10:15:32.00Z", 350),
                new Reading("2023-09-21T10:15:33.00Z", 310)
        );
    }

}</code></pre>
<p>Suppose, further, that we want to detect suspicious changes in this stream, defined as temperature changes of more than 30° Kelvin across two consecutive readings within a five-second window of time:</p>
<pre><code>boolean isSuspicious(Reading previous, Reading next) {
    return next.obtainedAt().isBefore(previous.obtainedAt().plusSeconds(5))
           &amp;&amp; (next.degreesK() &gt; previous.degreesK() + 30
               || next.degreesK() &lt; previous.degreesK() - 30);
}</code></pre>
<p>This requires a sequential scan of the input stream, so we must eschew declarative stream processing and implement our analysis imperatively:</p>
<pre><code>List&lt;List&lt;Reading&gt;&gt; findSuspicious(Stream&lt;Reading&gt; source) {
    var suspicious = new ArrayList&lt;List&lt;Reading&gt;&gt;();
    Reading previous = null;
    boolean hasPrevious = false;
    for (Reading next : source.toList()) {
        if (!hasPrevious) {
            hasPrevious = true;
            previous = next;
        } else {
            if (isSuspicious(previous, next))
                suspicious.add(List.of(previous, next));
            previous = next;
        }
    }
    return suspicious;
}

var result = findSuspicious(Reading.loadRecentReadings());

// result ==&gt; [[Reading[obtainedAt=2023-09-21T10:15:31Z, degreesK=312],
//              Reading[obtainedAt=2023-09-21T10:15:32Z, degreesK=350]],
//             [Reading[obtainedAt=2023-09-21T10:15:32Z, degreesK=350],
//              Reading[obtainedAt=2023-09-21T10:15:33Z, degreesK=310]]]</code></pre>
<p>With a gatherer, however, we can express this more succinctly:</p>
<pre><code>List&lt;List&lt;Reading&gt;&gt; findSuspicious(Stream&lt;Reading&gt; source) {
    return source.gather(Gatherers.windowSliding(2))
                 .filter(window -&gt; (window.size() == 2
                                    &amp;&amp; isSuspicious(window.get(0),
                                                    window.get(1))))
                 .toList();
}</code></pre>

<h2 id="Risks-and-Assumptions">Risks and Assumptions</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The use of custom gatherers, and of the built-in gatherers declared in the <code>Gatherers</code> class, will not be as succinct as the use of the built-in intermediate operations declared in the <code>Stream</code> class. The definition of custom gatherers will, however, be similar in complexity to the definition of custom collectors for terminal <code>collect</code> operations.  The use of both custom and built-in gatherers will, moreover, be similar in complexity to the use of custom collectors and the built-in collectors declared in the <code>Collectors</code> class.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We might revise the set of built-in gatherers over the course of previewing this feature, and we might revise the set of built-in gatherers in future releases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We will not add a new intermediate operation to the <code>Stream</code> class for each of the built-in gatherers defined in the <code>Gatherers</code> class, even though for the sake of uniformity it is tempting to do so. In order to preserve the learnability of the <code>Stream</code> class we will consider adding new intermediate operations to it only after experience suggests that they are broadly useful. We might add such methods in a later round of preview, or even after this feature is final. Exposing new built-in gatherers now does not preclude adding dedicated <code>Stream</code> methods later.</p>

		<div data-first_letter="I">
		<p>I was yet again spectacularly wrong in speculating that we had another eight months to wait before Apple would release the first Macs with M3 chips. Another few days and the first will be upon us, and the fortunate few will start bragging or moaning about their performance. That has suddenly grown more complex: the number of each CPU core type has diversified with the M3 Pro in particular. This article looks at some of the factors involved in comparing CPU performance across Apple’s expanded range of M-series chips.</p>
<h4>Core capability</h4>
<p>The terms <em>Performance</em> and <em>Efficiency</em> are convenient labels, but there’s important detail in the <a href="https://eclecticlight.co/2022/10/05/making-the-most-of-apple-silicon-power-2-core-capabilities/">architecture of core types</a>. E cores achieve their enhanced energy efficiency by a combination of running at lower frequency and having fewer processing units. Each of the M1’s Icestorm E cores are roughly half a Firestorm P core, so all other factors being equal, an Icestorm E core would be expected to perform at about half the throughput of a Firestorm. Although I haven’t seen similar analysis for the M2’s Blizzard (E) and Avalanche (P) cores, I would expect a similar difference, and in the M3.</p>
<h4>Frequency management</h4>
<p>Not only do the core types differ in their maximum frequencies, typically over 3 GHz for P and 2 GHz for E cores, but their frequency management can be quite different depending on which chip they’re running in. Frequency control of both core types is highly dynamic, and they can go from idle to maximum remarkably quickly when required. This <a href="https://eclecticlight.co/2022/10/17/making-the-most-of-apple-silicon-power-4-frequency/">became apparent</a> when I looked at P and E core frequency management in the basic M1 and M1 Pro/Max chips.</p>
<p><span><img data-attachment-id="68261" data-permalink="https://eclecticlight.co/m1allcoresfloatupd/" data-orig-file="https://eclecticlightdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2022/10/m1allcoresfloatupd.png" data-orig-size="1022,821" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="m1allcoresfloatupd" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://eclecticlightdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2022/10/m1allcoresfloatupd.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://eclecticlightdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2022/10/m1allcoresfloatupd.png?w=940" src="https://eclecticlightdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2022/10/m1allcoresfloatupd.png?w=940" alt="m1allcoresfloatupd" srcset="https://eclecticlightdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2022/10/m1allcoresfloatupd.png 1022w, https://eclecticlightdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2022/10/m1allcoresfloatupd.png?w=150&amp;h=120 150w, https://eclecticlightdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2022/10/m1allcoresfloatupd.png?w=300&amp;h=241 300w, https://eclecticlightdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2022/10/m1allcoresfloatupd.png?w=768&amp;h=617 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1022px) 100vw, 1022px"></span></p>
<p>This graph shows the relationship between the rate of executing tight CPU code loops of basic floating point arithmetic with only register access, and the number of threads, equating to the number of cores being used.</p>
<p>The upper solid line shows this relationship for P cores being used at maximum Quality of Service (QoS). Each thread effectively adds 0.15 billion loops/second to total throughout, whether on an original M1 (+ points) or M1 Pro (♢ unfilled diamonds). Although not shown here, on an M1 Pro that line continues up to its total of eight P cores.</p>
<p>The broken line below shows the same relationship for E cores in an original M1, this time each thread adding 0.033 billion loops/second, 22% of the throughout of each P thread. Shown in red, though, are the equivalent points for the two E cores in an M1 Pro (or Max): with one thread, throughput is the same as an original M1, but with both cores active, throughput more than doubles that of two threads on the original chip. That’s macOS controlling the E core frequency to ensure that M1 Pro and Max chips don’t perform any slower than those in the original M1, and in fact are here slighter faster than all four E cores together, running at 1000 MHz.</p>
<h4>Cluster architecture</h4>
<p>In M-series chips CPU cores don’t operate independently, but are grouped together into clusters of up to four cores that share L2 cache and are run at the same frequency. In M1 and M2 chips, most P clusters have consisted of four cores, while E clusters have been either two or four in size. M3 Pro chips are the first for Apple silicon Macs in which there are two clusters of 4 and 2 cores, for each of the core types. That begs the question as to whether macOS will manage those with 4-core clusters activated first, leaving the 2-core clusters idling until they’re needed, or it will activate the 2-core clusters first. Although this will have little effect on performance, it should be significant for energy use.</p>
<h4>E cores aren’t just for background threads</h4>
<p>While P cores do deliver high performance, never underestimate the work that can be done by E cores. Sonoma’s new <a href="https://eclecticlight.co/2023/10/18/how-game-mode-manages-cpu-and-gpu/">Game Mode</a> dedicates the two E cores in M1 Pro and Max chips to the game, and in practice that works very well. M3 Pro chips with their six E cores may well not hand over all of those in Game Mode, but even four dedicated E cores should deliver ample for a wide range of apps, particularly those in which GPU performance is more critical.</p>
<p>In contrast, lightweight <a href="https://eclecticlight.co/2023/10/23/how-does-macos-manage-virtual-cores-on-apple-silicon/">virtualisation of macOS</a> loads P cores first, and the impact of running host apps alongside a macOS VM could limit performance more on an M3 Pro (6P + 6E) compared to an M1 Pro/Max (8P + 2E).</p>
<h4>Beware of benchmarks</h4>
<p>Although we’re going to hear a lot of results from benchmarking apps like Geekbench, remember that the tests they run don’t simulate real-world CPU usage. For instance, they’re designed to run the same processes on each core when being used to measure multicore performance. In reality, macOS should manage distribution of the very different threads running in real-world use, to make best use of the cores available. Benchmark results are but part of the evaluation of performance.</p>
<p>When you hear anyone making claims that the 6P + 6E design of the M3 Pro is merely 50% more than a regular M3 chip with its 4P + 4E, or slightly over half an M3 Max at 12P + 4E, get them to show you their evidence. Measuring and comparing the performance of Apple’s new M3 chips has become much more complicated, and that’s before we’ve even considered the GPU.</p>
<p>Finally, be very wary of what you see in Activity Monitor’s CPU History window. While it does show broad trends in the distribution of workload across different cores, it doesn’t take account of frequency. There’s a world of difference between an E core running at 100% and a frequency of 1 GHz and a P core running at 100% and well over 3 GHz. If you want the full picture, then you have to resort to tools like <code>powermetrics</code>.</p>

Subject: <a href="#r" id="t">[PATCH RFC 00/20] Setting up Binder for the future</a>
Date: Wed, 01 Nov 2023 18:01:30 +0000	<a href="#r">[thread overview]</a>
Message-ID: &lt;20231101-rust-binder-v1-0-08ba9197f637@google.com&gt; (<a href="https://lore.kernel.org/rust-for-linux/20231101-rust-binder-v1-0-08ba9197f637@google.com/raw">raw</a>)

We're generally not proponents of rewrites (nasty uncomfortable things
that make you late for dinner!). So why rewrite Binder? 

Binder has been evolving over the past 15+ years to meet the evolving
needs of Android. Its responsibilities, expectations, and complexity
have grown considerably during that time. While we expect Binder to
continue to evolve along with Android, there are a number of factors
that currently constrain our ability to develop/maintain it. Briefly
those are:

1. Complexity: Binder is at the intersection of everything in Android and
   fulfills many responsibilities beyond IPC. It has become many things
   to many people, and due to its many features and their interactions
   with each other, its complexity is quite high. In just 6kLOC it must
   deliver transactions to the right threads. It must correctly parse
   and translate the contents of transactions, which can contain several
   objects of different types (e.g., pointers, fds) that can interact
   with each other. It controls the size of thread pools in userspace,
   and ensures that transactions are assigned to threads in ways that
   avoid deadlocks where the threadpool has run out of threads. It must
   track refcounts of objects that are shared by several processes by
   forwarding refcount changes between the processes correctly.  It must
   handle numerous error scenarios and it combines/nests 13 different
   locks, 7 reference counters, and atomic variables. Finally, It must
   do all of this as fast and efficiently as possible. Minor performance
   regressions can cause a noticeably degraded user experience.

2. Things to improve: Thousand-line functions [1], error-prone error
   handling [2], and confusing structure can occur as a code base grows
   organically. After more than a decade of development, this codebase
   could use an overhaul.

3. Security critical: Binder is a critical part of Android's sandboxing
   strategy. Even Android's most de-privileged sandboxes (e.g. the
   Chrome renderer, or SW Codec) have direct access to Binder. More than
   just about any other component, it's important that Binder provide
   robust security, and itself be robust against security
   vulnerabilities.

It's #1 (high complexity) that has made continuing to evolve Binder and
resolving #2 (tech debt) exceptionally difficult without causing #3
(security issues). For Binder to continue to meet Android's needs, we
need better ways to manage (and reduce!) complexity without increasing
the risk.

The biggest change is obviously the choice of programming language. We
decided to use Rust because it directly addresses a number of the
challenges within Binder that we have faced during the last years. It
prevents mistakes with ref counting, locking, bounds checking, and also
does a lot to reduce the complexity of error handling. Additionally,
we've been able to use the more expressive type system to encode the
ownership semantics of the various structs and pointers, which takes the
complexity of managing object lifetimes out of the hands of the
programmer, reducing the risk of use-after-frees and similar problems.

Rust has many different pointer types that it uses to encode ownership
semantics into the type system, and this is probably one of the most
important aspects of how it helps in Binder. The Binder driver has a lot
of different objects that have complex ownership semantics; some
pointers own a refcount, some pointers have exclusive ownership, and
some pointers just reference the object and it is kept alive in some
other manner. With Rust, we can use a different pointer type for each
kind of pointer, which enables the compiler to enforce that the
ownership semantics are implemented correctly.

Another useful feature is Rust's error handling. Rust allows for more
simplified error handling with features such as destructors, and you get
compilation failures if errors are not properly handled. This means that
even though Rust requires you to spend more lines of code than C on
things such as writing down invariants that are left implicit in C, the
Rust driver is still slightly smaller than C binder: Rust is 5.5kLOC and
C is 5.8kLOC. (These numbers are excluding blank lines, comments,
binderfs, and any debugging facilities in C that are not yet implemented
in the Rust driver. The numbers include abstractions in rust/kernel/
that are unlikely to be used by other drivers than Binder.)

Although this rewrite completely rethinks how the code is structured and
how assumptions are enforced, we do not fundamentally change *how* the
driver does the things it does. A lot of careful thought has gone into
the existing design. The rewrite is aimed rather at improving code
health, structure, readability, robustness, security, maintainability
and extensibility. We also include more inline documentation, and
improve how assumptions in the code are enforced. Furthermore, all
unsafe code is annotated with a SAFETY comment that explains why it is
correct.

We have left the binderfs filesystem component in C. Rewriting it in
Rust would be a large amount of work and requires a lot of bindings to
the file system interfaces. Binderfs has not historically had the same
challenges with security and complexity, so rewriting binderfs seems to
have lower value than the rest of Binder.

Correctness and feature parity
------------------------------

Rust binder passes all tests that validate the correctness of Binder in
the Android Open Source Project. We can boot a device, and run a variety
of apps and functionality without issues. We have performed this both on
the Cuttlefish Android emulator device, and on a Pixel 6 Pro.

As for feature parity, Rust binder currently implements all features
that C binder supports, with the exception of some debugging facilities.
The missing debugging facilities will be added before we submit the Rust
implementation upstream.

Performance numbers
-------------------

We have tested the driver using two different benchmarks:
binderThroughputTest [3] and binderRpcBenchmark [4]. These benchmarks
show that the Rust implementation has very promising performance
characteristics. That said, these are only microbenchmarks with very
simple workloads, and there is still a lot of work to be done before we
can truly understand how the drivers compare in the real world.

These tables depict roundtrip latencies of transactions as measured by
binderThroughputTest. Each measurement is given in microseconds. Each

better for Rust.

We've found that Rust binder has similar performance to C binder on the
binderThroughputTest benchmark. The average latencies fluctuate between
-1.96% and +1.38%.

This table depicts wall clock time and cpu time measurements over
various test cases. Each measurement is given in microseconds. The
throughput benchmarks correspond to the
BM_throughputForTransportAndBytes test case, and the number is the size
of the payload. Negative percentages are better for Rust.

From the above, we find that Rust binder is competitive for all test
cases except for those with very large transaction sizes. However, this
is a very rare case in practice [5] and we've been able to fix all other
performance issues that we've run into, so there's no reason to think
that we won't also be able to fix this issue. We did not fix it for this
RFC because we prioritized getting the RFC out to provide context for
the upcoming discussion at Linux Plumbers Conference [6].

We ran all of the benchmarks with cross-language LTO enabled, so that C
code can be inlined into Rust code. We get similar results on the
Cuttlefish Android emulator (which has an x86 architecture).

The Binder driver is very performance critical, and although our initial
numbers are promising, we must gain a better understanding of how it
performs in realistic workloads and not just in simple benchmarks. What
we ultimately care about is the performance impact that it has on the
whole system. Much work remains to be done on this front.

Dependencies
------------

When implementing kernel drivers in Rust, you must write bindings for
each subsystem that we need to call into from Rust. Binder requires
quite a few of them. We have not included them in this patch series, but
you can view them at the following branch:

<a href="https://github.com/Darksonn/linux/commits/rust-binder-rfc">https://github.com/Darksonn/linux/commits/rust-binder-rfc</a>

The branch is based on top of commit 639409a4ac8e ("Merge tag
'wq-for-6.7-rust-bindings' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tj/wq"),
which is available in mainline. I did not base it on a tag, since there
is not yet any tag that includes the Rust workqueue abstractions.

This RFC uses the kernel's red-black tree for key/value mappings, but we
are aware that the red-black tree is deprecated. We did this to make the
performance comparison more fair, since C binder also uses rbtree for
this. We intend to replace these with XArrays instead. That said, we
don't think that XArray is a good fit for the range allocator, and we
propose to continue using the red-black tree for the range allocator.
(see patch 6)

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>A recent article on <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/blog/wasmgc">WebAssembly Garbage Collection (WasmGC)</a> explains at a high level how the <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/gc">Garbage Collection (GC) proposal</a> aims to better support GC languages in Wasm, which is very important given their popularity. In this article, we will get into the technical details of how GC languages such as Java, Kotlin, Dart, Python, and C# can be ported to Wasm. There are in fact two main approaches:</p><ul><li>The “<strong>traditional</strong>” porting approach, in which an existing implementation of the language is compiled to WasmMVP, that is, the WebAssembly Minimum Viable Product that launched in 2017.</li><li>The <strong>WasmGC</strong> porting approach, in which the language is compiled down to GC constructs in Wasm itself that are defined in the recent GC proposal.</li></ul><p>We’ll explain what those two approaches are and the technical tradeoffs between them, especially regarding size and speed. While doing so, we’ll see that WasmGC has several major advantages, but it also requires new work both in toolchains and in Virtual Machines (VMs). The later sections of this article will explain what the V8 team has been doing in those areas, including benchmark numbers. If you’re interested in Wasm, GC, or both, we hope you’ll find this interesting, and make sure to check out the demo and getting started links near the end!</p><h2 id="the-%E2%80%9Ctraditional%E2%80%9D-porting-approach" tabindex="-1">The “Traditional” Porting Approach <a href="#the-%E2%80%9Ctraditional%E2%80%9D-porting-approach">#</a></h2><p>How are languages typically ported to new architectures? Say that Python wants to run on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture_family">ARM architecture</a>, or Dart wants to run on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIPS_architecture">MIPS architecture</a>. The general idea is then to recompile the VM to that architecture. Aside from that, if the VM has architecture-specific code, like just-in-time (JIT) or ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation, then you also implement a backend for JIT/AOT for the new architecture. This approach makes a lot of sense, because often the main part of the codebase can just be recompiled for each new architecture you port to:</p><figure><img alt="" height="540" loading="lazy" src="https://v8.dev/_img/wasm-gc-porting/ported-vm.svg" width="720" title="On the left, main runtime code including a parser, garbage collector, optimizer, library support, and more; on the right, separate backend code for x64, ARM, etc."><figcaption>Structure of a ported VM</figcaption></figure><p>In this figure, the parser, library support, garbage collector, optimizer, etc., are all shared between all architectures in the main runtime. Porting to a new architecture only requires a new backend for it, which is a comparatively small amount of code.</p><p>Wasm is a low-level compiler target and so it is not surprising that the traditional porting approach can be used. Since Wasm first started we have seen this work well in practice in many cases, such as <a href="https://pyodide.org/en/stable/">Pyodide for Python</a> and <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor">Blazor for C#</a> (note that Blazor supports both <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/host-and-deploy/webassembly?view=aspnetcore-7.0#ahead-of-time-aot-compilation">AOT</a> and <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/main/docs/design/mono/jiterpreter.md">JIT</a> compilation, so it is a nice example of all the above). In all these cases, a runtime for the language is compiled into WasmMVP just like any other program that is compiled to Wasm, and so the result uses WasmMVP’s linear memory, table, functions, and so forth.</p><p>As mentioned before, this is how languages are typically ported to new architectures, so it makes a lot of sense for the usual reason that you can reuse almost all the existing VM code, including language implementation and optimizations. It turns out, however, that there are several Wasm-specific downsides to this approach, and that is where WasmGC can help.</p><h2 id="the-wasmgc-porting-approach" tabindex="-1">The WasmGC Porting Approach <a href="#the-wasmgc-porting-approach">#</a></h2><p>Briefly, the GC proposal for WebAssembly (“WasmGC”) allows you to define struct and array types and perform operations such as create instances of them, read from and write to fields, cast between types, etc. (for more details, see the <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/gc/blob/main/proposals/gc/Overview.md">proposal overview</a>). Those objects are managed by the Wasm VM’s own GC implementation, which is the main difference between this approach and the traditional porting approach.</p><p>It may help to think of it like this: <em>If the traditional porting approach is how one ports a language to an <strong>architecture</strong>, then the WasmGC approach is very similar to how one ports a language to a <strong>VM</strong></em>. For example, if you want to port Java to JavaScript, then you can use a compiler like <a href="https://j2cl.io/">J2CL</a> which represents Java objects as JavaScript objects, and those JavaScript objects are then managed by the JavaScript VM just like all others. Porting languages to existing VMs is a very useful technique, as can be seen by all the languages that compile to <a href="https://gist.github.com/matthiasak/c3c9c40d0f98ca91def1">JavaScript</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_JVM_languages">the JVM</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_CLI_languages">the CLR</a>.</p><p>This architecture/VM metaphor is not an exact one, in particular because WasmGC intends to be lower-level than the other VMs we mentioned in the last paragraph. Still, WasmGC defines VM-managed structs and arrays and a type system for describing their shapes and relationships, and porting to WasmGC is the process of representing your language’s constructs with those primitives; this is certainly higher-level than a traditional port to WasmMVP (which lowers everything into untyped bytes in linear memory). Thus, WasmGC is quite similar to ports of languages to VMs, and it shares the advantages of such ports, in particular good integration with the target VM and reuse of its optimizations.</p><h2 id="comparing-the-two-approaches" tabindex="-1">Comparing the Two Approaches <a href="#comparing-the-two-approaches">#</a></h2><p>Now that we have an idea of what the two porting approaches for GC languages are, let’s see how they compare.</p><h3 id="shipping-memory-management-code" tabindex="-1">Shipping memory management code <a href="#shipping-memory-management-code">#</a></h3><p>In practice, a lot of Wasm code is run inside a VM that already has a garbage collector, which is the case on the Web, and also in runtimes like <a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a>, <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/workerd">workerd</a>, <a href="https://deno.com/">Deno</a>, and <a href="https://bun.sh/">Bun</a>. In such places, shipping a GC implementation adds unnecessary size to the Wasm binary. In fact, this is not just a problem with GC languages in WasmMVP, but also with languages using linear memory like C, C++, and Rust, since code in those languages that does any sort of interesting allocation will end up bundling <code>malloc/free</code> to manage linear memory, which requires several kilobytes of code. For example, <code>dlmalloc</code> requires 6K, and even a malloc that trades off speed for size, like <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/emscripten-discuss/c/SCZMkfk8hyk/m/yDdZ8Db3AwAJ"><code>emmalloc</code></a>, takes over 1K. WasmGC, on the other hand, has the VM automatically manage memory for us so we need no memory management code at all—neither a GC nor <code>malloc/free</code>—in the Wasm. In <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/blog/wasmgc">the previously-mentioned article on WasmGC</a>, the size of the <code>fannkuch</code> benchmark was measured and WasmGC was much smaller than C or Rust—<strong>2.3</strong> K vs <strong>6.1-9.6</strong> K—for this exact reason.</p><h3 id="cycle-collection" tabindex="-1">Cycle collection <a href="#cycle-collection">#</a></h3><p>In browsers, Wasm often interacts with JavaScript (and through JavaScript, Web APIs), but in WasmMVP (and even with the <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/reference-types/blob/master/proposals/reference-types/Overview.md">reference types</a> proposal) there is no way to have bidirectional links between Wasm and JS that allow cycles to be collected in a fine-grained manner. Links to JS objects can only be placed in the Wasm table, and links back to the Wasm can only refer to the entire Wasm instance as a single big object, like this:</p><figure><img alt="" height="300" loading="lazy" src="https://v8.dev/_img/wasm-gc-porting/cycle2.svg" width="495" title="Individual JS objects refer to a single big Wasm instance, and not to individual objects inside it."><figcaption>Cycles between JS and an entire Wasm module</figcaption></figure><p>That is not enough to efficiently collect specific cycles of objects where some happen to be in the compiled VM and some in JavaScript. With WasmGC, on the other hand, we define Wasm objects that the VM is aware of, and so we can have proper references from Wasm to JavaScript and back:</p><figure><img alt="" height="225" loading="lazy" src="https://v8.dev/_img/wasm-gc-porting/cycle3.svg" width="445" title="JS and Wasm objects with links between them."><figcaption>Cycles between JS and WasmGC objects</figcaption></figure><h3 id="gc-references-on-the-stack" tabindex="-1">GC references on the stack <a href="#gc-references-on-the-stack">#</a></h3><p>GC languages must be aware of references on the stack, that is, from local variables in a call scope, as such references may be the only thing keeping an object alive. In a traditional port of a GC language that is a problem because Wasm’s sandboxing prevents programs from inspecting their own stack. There are solutions for traditional ports, like a shadow stack (<a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen/blob/main/src/passes/SpillPointers.cpp">which can be done automatically</a>), or only collecting garbage when nothing is on the stack (which is the case in between turns of the JavaScript event loop). A possible future addition which would help traditional ports might be <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/design/issues/1459">stack scanning support</a> in Wasm. For now, only WasmGC can handle stack references without overhead, and it does so completely automatically since the Wasm VM is in charge of GC.</p><h3 id="gc-efficiency" tabindex="-1">GC Efficiency <a href="#gc-efficiency">#</a></h3><p>A related issue is the efficiency of performing a GC. Both porting approaches have potential advantages here. A traditional port can reuse optimizations in an existing VM that may be tailored to a particular language, such as a heavy focus on optimizing interior pointers or short-lived objects. A WasmGC port that runs on the Web, on the other hand, has the advantage of reusing all the work that has gone into making JavaScript GC fast, including techniques like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracing_garbage_collection#Generational_GC_(ephemeral_GC)">generational GC</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracing_garbage_collection#Stop-the-world_vs._incremental_vs._concurrent">incremental collection</a>, etc. WasmGC also leaves GC to the VM, which makes things like efficient write barriers simpler.</p><p>Another advantage of WasmGC is that the GC can be aware of things like memory pressure and can adjust its heap size and collection frequency accordingly, again, as JavaScript VMs already do on the Web.</p><h3 id="memory-fragmentation" tabindex="-1">Memory fragmentation <a href="#memory-fragmentation">#</a></h3><p>Over time, and especially in long-running programs, <code>malloc/free</code> operations on WasmMVP linear memory can cause <em>fragmentation</em>. Imagine that we have a total of 2 MB of memory, and right in the middle of it we have an existing small allocation of only a few bytes. In languages like C, C++, and Rust it is impossible to move an arbitrary allocation at runtime, and so we have almost 1MB to the left of that allocation and almost 1MB to the right. But those are two separate fragments, and so if we try to allocate 1.5 MB we will fail, even though we do have that amount of total unallocated memory:</p><figure><img alt="" height="271" loading="lazy" src="https://v8.dev/_img/wasm-gc-porting/fragment1.svg" width="541" title="A linear memory with a rude small allocation right in the middle, splitting the free space into 2 halves."></figure><p>Such fragmentation can force a Wasm module to grow its memory more often, which <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/design/issues/1397">adds overhead and can cause out-of-memory errors</a>; <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/design/issues/1439">improvements</a> are being designed, but it is a challenging problem. This is an issue in all WasmMVP programs, including traditional ports of GC languages (note that the GC objects themselves might be movable, but not parts of the runtime itself). WasmGC, on the other hand, avoids this issue because memory is completely managed by the VM, which can move them around to compact the GC heap and avoid fragmentation.</p><h3 id="developer-tools-integration" tabindex="-1">Developer tools integration <a href="#developer-tools-integration">#</a></h3><p>In a traditional port to WasmMVP, objects are placed in linear memory which is hard for developer tools to provide useful information about, because such tools only see bytes without high-level type information. In WasmGC, on the other hand, the VM manages GC objects so better integration is possible. For example, in Chrome you can use the heap profiler to measure memory usage of a WasmGC program:</p><figure><img alt="" height="395" loading="lazy" src="https://v8.dev/_img/wasm-gc-porting/devtools.png" width="1916"><figcaption>WasmGC code running in the Chrome heap profiler</figcaption></figure><p>The figure above shows the Memory tab in Chrome DevTools, where we have a heap snapshot of a page that ran WasmGC code that created 1,001 small objects in a <a href="https://gist.github.com/kripken/5cd3e18b6de41c559d590e44252eafff">linked list</a>. You can see the name of the object’s type, <code>$Node</code>, and the field <code>$next</code> which refers to the next object in the list. All the usual heap snapshot information is present, like the number of objects, the shallow size, the retained size, and so forth, letting us easily see how much memory is actually used by WasmGC objects. Other Chrome DevTools features like the debugger work as well on WasmGC objects.</p><h3 id="language-semantics" tabindex="-1">Language Semantics <a href="#language-semantics">#</a></h3><p>When you recompile a VM in a traditional port you get the exact language you expect, since you’re running familiar code that implements that language. That’s a major advantage! In comparison, with a WasmGC port you may end up considering compromises in semantics in return for efficiency. That is because with WasmGC we define new GC types—structs and arrays—and compile to them. As a result, we can’t simply compile a VM written in C, C++, Rust, or similar languages to that form, since those only compile to linear memory, and so WasmGC can’t help with the great majority of existing VM codebases. Instead, in a WasmGC port you typically write new code that transforms your language’s constructs into WasmGC primitives. And there are multiple ways to do that transformation, with different tradeoffs.</p><p>Whether compromises are needed or not depends on how a particular language’s constructs can be implemented in WasmGC. For example, WasmGC struct fields have fixed indexes and types, so a language that wishes to access fields in a more dynamic manner <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/gc/issues/397">may have challenges</a>; there are various ways to work around that, and in that space of solutions some options may be simpler or faster but not support the full original semantics of the language. (WasmGC has other current limitations as well, for example, it lacks <a href="https://go.dev/blog/ismmkeynote">interior pointers</a>; over time such things are expected to <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/gc/blob/main/proposals/gc/Post-MVP.md">improve</a>.)</p><p>As we’ve mentioned, compiling to WasmGC is like compiling to an existing VM, and there are many examples of compromises that make sense in such ports. For example, <a href="https://dart.dev/guides/language/numbers">dart2js (Dart compiled to JavaScript) numbers behave differently than in the Dart VM</a>, and <a href="https://nedbatchelder.com/blog/201703/ironpython_is_weird.html">IronPython (Python compiled to .NET) strings behave like C# strings</a>. As a result, not all programs of a language may run in such ports, but there are good reasons for these choices: Implementing dart2js numbers as JavaScript numbers lets VMs optimize them well, and using .NET strings in IronPython means you can pass those strings to other .NET code with no overhead.</p><p>While compromises may be needed in WasmGC ports, WasmGC also has some advantages as a compiler target compared to JavaScript in particular. For example, while dart2js has the numeric limitations we just mentioned, <a href="https://flutter.dev/wasm">dart2wasm</a> (Dart compiled to WasmGC) behaves exactly as it should, without compromise (that is possible since Wasm has efficient representations for the numeric types Dart requires).</p><p>Why isn’t this an issue for traditional ports? Simply because they recompile an existing VM into linear memory, where objects are stored in untyped bytes, which is lower-level than WasmGC. When all you have are untyped bytes then you have a lot more flexibility to do all manner of low-level (and potentially unsafe) tricks, and by recompiling an existing VM you get all the tricks that VM has up its sleeve.</p><h3 id="toolchain-effort" tabindex="-1">Toolchain Effort <a href="#toolchain-effort">#</a></h3><p>As we mentioned in the previous subsection, a WasmGC port cannot simply recompile an existing VM. You might be able to reuse certain code (such as parser logic and AOT optimizations, because those don’t integrate with the GC at runtime), but in general WasmGC ports require a substantial amount of new code.</p><p>In comparison, traditional ports to WasmMVP can be simpler and quicker: for example, you can compile the Lua VM (written in C) to Wasm in just a few minutes. A WasmGC port of Lua, on the other hand, would require more effort as you’d need to write code to lower Lua’s constructs into WasmGC structs and arrays, and you’d need to decide how to actually do that within the specific constraints of the WasmGC type system.</p><p>Greater toolchain effort is therefore a significant disadvantage of WasmGC porting. However, given all the advantages we’ve mentioned earlier, we think WasmGC is still very appealing! The ideal situation would be one in which WasmGC’s type system could support all languages efficiently, and all languages put in the work to implement a WasmGC port. The first part of that will be helped by <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/gc/blob/main/proposals/gc/Post-MVP.md">future additions to the WasmGC type system</a>, and for the second, we can reduce the work involved in WasmGC ports by sharing the effort on the toolchain side as much as possible. Luckily, it turns out that WasmGC makes it very practical to share toolchain work, which we’ll see in the next section.</p><h2 id="optimizing-wasmgc" tabindex="-1">Optimizing WasmGC <a href="#optimizing-wasmgc">#</a></h2><p>We’ve already mentioned that WasmGC ports have potential speed advantages, such as using less memory and reusing optimizations in the host GC. In this section we’ll show other interesting optimization advantages of WasmGC over WasmMVP, which can have a large impact on how WasmGC ports are designed and how fast the final results are.</p><p>The key issue here is that <em>WasmGC is higher-level than WasmMVP</em>. To get an intuition for that, remember that we’ve already said that a traditional port to WasmMVP is like porting to a new architecture while a WasmGC port is like porting to a new VM, and VMs are of course higher-level abstractions over architectures—and higher-level representations are often more optimizable. We can perhaps see this more clearly with a concrete example in pseudocode:</p><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>foo</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>  <span>let</span> x <span>=</span> <span><span>allocate</span><span><span>&lt;</span>T<span>&gt;</span></span></span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> <span>// Allocate a GC object.</span><br>  x<span>.</span>val <span>=</span> <span>10</span><span>;</span>            <span>// Set a field to 10.</span><br>  <span>let</span> y <span>=</span> <span><span>allocate</span><span><span>&lt;</span>T<span>&gt;</span></span></span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> <span>// Allocate another object.</span><br>  y<span>.</span>val <span>=</span> x<span>.</span>val<span>;</span>         <span>// This must be 10.</span><br>  <span>return</span> y<span>.</span>val<span>;</span>          <span>// This must also be 10.</span><br><span>}</span></code></pre><p>As the comments indicate, <code>x.val</code> will contain <code>10</code>, as will <code>y.val</code>, so the final return is of <code>10</code> as well, and then the optimizer can even remove the allocations, leading to this:</p><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>foo</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>  <span>return</span> <span>10</span><span>;</span><br><span>}</span></code></pre><p>Great! Sadly, however, that is not possible in WasmMVP, because each allocation turns into a call to <code>malloc</code>, a large and complex function in the Wasm which has side effects on linear memory. As a result of those side effects, the optimizer must assume that the second allocation (for <code>y</code>) might alter <code>x.val</code>, which also resides in linear memory. Memory management is complex, and when we implement it inside the Wasm at a low level then our optimization options are limited.</p><p>In contrast, in WasmGC we operate at a higher level: each allocation executes the <code>struct.new</code> instruction, a VM operation that we can actually reason about, and an optimizer can track references as well to conclude that <code>x.val</code> is written exactly once with the value <code>10</code>. As a result we can optimize that function down to a simple return of <code>10</code> as expected!</p><p>Aside from allocations, other things WasmGC adds are explicit function pointers (<code>ref.func</code>) and calls using them (<code>call_ref</code>), types on struct and array fields (unlike untyped linear memory), and more. As a result, WasmGC is a higher-level Intermediate Representation (IR) than WasmMVP, and much more optimizable.</p><p>If WasmMVP has limited optimizability, why is it as fast as it is? Wasm, after all, can run pretty close to full native speed. That is because WasmMVP is generally the output of a powerful optimizing compiler like LLVM. LLVM IR, like WasmGC and unlike WasmMVP, has a special representation for allocations and so forth, so LLVM can optimize the things we’ve been discussing. The design of WasmMVP is that most optimizations happen at the toolchain level <em>before</em> Wasm, and Wasm VMs only do the “last mile” of optimization (things like register allocation).</p><p>Can WasmGC adopt a similar toolchain model as WasmMVP, and in particular use LLVM? Unfortunately, no, since LLVM does not support WasmGC (some amount of support <a href="https://github.com/Igalia/ref-cpp">has been explored</a>, but it is hard to see how full support could even work). Also, many GC languages do not use LLVM–there is a wide variety of compiler toolchains in that space. And so we need something else for WasmGC.</p><p>Luckily, as we’ve mentioned, WasmGC is very optimizable, and that opens up new options. Here is one way to look at that:</p><figure><img alt="" height="318" loading="lazy" src="https://v8.dev/_img/wasm-gc-porting/workflows1.svg" width="720"><figcaption>WasmMVP and WasmGC toolchain workflows</figcaption></figure><p>Both the WasmMVP and WasmGC workflows begin with the same two boxes on the left: we start with source code that is processed and optimized in a language-specific manner (which each language knows best about itself). Then a difference appears: for WasmMVP we must perform general-purpose optimizations first and then lower to Wasm, while for WasmGC we have the option to first lower to Wasm and optimize later. This is important because there is a large advantage to optimizing after lowering: then we can share toolchain code for general-purpose optimizations between all languages that compile to WasmGC. The next figure shows what that looks like:</p><figure><img alt="" height="540" loading="lazy" src="https://v8.dev/_img/wasm-gc-porting/workflows2.svg" width="720" title="Several languages on the left compile to WasmGC in the middle, and all that flows into the Binaryen optimizer (wasm-opt)."><figcaption>Multiple WasmGC toolchains are optimized by the Binaryen optimizer</figcaption></figure><p>Since we can do general optimizations <em>after</em> compiling to WasmGC, a Wasm-to-Wasm optimizer can help all WasmGC compiler toolchains. For this reason the V8 team has invested in WasmGC in <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen/">Binaryen</a>, which all toolchains can use as the <code>wasm-opt</code> commandline tool. We’ll focus on that in the next subsection.</p><h3 id="toolchain-optimizations" tabindex="-1">Toolchain optimizations <a href="#toolchain-optimizations">#</a></h3><p><a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen/">Binaryen</a>, the WebAssembly toolchain optimizer project, already had a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lLqZR4ufSI">wide range of optimizations</a> for WasmMVP content such as inlining, constant propagation, dead code elimination, etc., almost all of which also apply to WasmGC. However, as we mentioned before, WasmGC allows us to do a lot more optimizations than WasmMVP, and we have written a lot of new optimizations accordingly:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen/blob/main/src/passes/Heap2Local.cpp">Escape analysis</a> to move heap allocations to locals.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen/blob/main/src/passes/ConstantFieldPropagation.cpp">Devirtualization</a> to turn indirect calls into direct ones (that can then be inlined, potentially).</li><li><a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen/pull/4621">More powerful global dead code elimination</a>.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen/pull/4598">Whole-program type-aware content flow analysis (GUFA)</a>.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen/blob/main/src/passes/OptimizeCasts.cpp">Cast optimizations</a> such as removing redundant casts and moving them to earlier locations.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen/blob/main/src/passes/GlobalTypeOptimization.cpp">Type pruning</a>.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen/blob/main/src/passes/TypeMerging.cpp">Type merging</a>.</li><li>Type refining (for <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen/blob/main/src/passes/LocalSubtyping.cpp">locals</a>, <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen/blob/main/src/passes/GlobalRefining.cpp">globals</a>, <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen/blob/main/src/passes/TypeRefining.cpp">fields</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen/blob/main/src/passes/SignatureRefining.cpp">signatures</a>).</li></ul><p>That’s just a quick list of some of the work we’ve been doing. For more on Binaryen’s new GC optimizations and how to use them, see the <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen/wiki/GC-Optimization-Guidebook">Binaryen docs</a>.</p><p>To measure the effectiveness of all those optimizations in Binaryen, let’s look at Java performance with and without <code>wasm-opt</code>, on output from the <a href="https://github.com/google/j2cl/tree/master/samples/wasm">J2Wasm</a> compiler which compiles Java to WasmGC:</p><figure><img alt="" height="371" loading="lazy" src="https://v8.dev/_img/wasm-gc-porting/benchmark1.svg" width="600" title="Box2D, DeltaBlue, RayTrace, and Richards benchmarks, all showing an improvement with wasm-opt."><figcaption>Java performance with and without wasm-opt</figcaption></figure><p>Here, “without wasm-opt” means we do not run Binaryen’s optimizations, but we do still optimize in the VM and in the J2Wasm compiler. As shown in the figure, <code>wasm-opt</code> provides a significant speedup on each of these benchmarks, on average making them <strong>1.9×</strong> faster.</p><p>In summary, <code>wasm-opt</code> can be used by any toolchain that compiles to WasmGC and it avoids the need to reimplement general-purpose optimizations in each. And, as we continue to improve Binaryen’s optimizations, that will benefit all toolchains that use <code>wasm-opt</code>, just like improvements to LLVM help all languages that compile to WasmMVP using LLVM.</p><p>Toolchain optimizations are just one part of the picture. As we will see next, optimizations in Wasm VMs are also absolutely critical.</p><h3 id="v8-optimizations" tabindex="-1">V8 optimizations <a href="#v8-optimizations">#</a></h3><p>As we’ve mentioned, WasmGC is more optimizable than WasmMVP, and not only toolchains can benefit from that but also VMs. And that turns out to be important because GC languages are different from the languages that compile to WasmMVP. Consider inlining, for example, which is one of the most important optimizations: Languages like C, C++, and Rust inline at compile time, while GC languages like Java and Dart typically run in a VM that inlines and optimizes at runtime. That performance model has affected both language design and how people write code in GC languages.</p><p>For example, in a language like Java, all calls begin as indirect (a child class can override a parent function, even when calling a child using a reference of the parent type). We benefit whenever the toolchain can turn an indirect call into a direct one, but in practice code patterns in real-world Java programs often have paths that actually do have lots of indirect calls, or at least ones that cannot be inferred statically to be direct. To handle those cases well, we’ve implemented <strong>speculative inlining</strong> in V8, that is, indirect calls are noted as they occur at runtime, and if we see that a call site has fairly simple behavior (few call targets), then we inline there with appropriate guard checks, which is closer to how Java is normally optimized than if we left such things entirely to the toolchain.</p><p>Real-world data validates that approach. We measured performance on the Google Sheets Calc Engine, which is a Java codebase that is used to compute spreadsheet formulas, which until now has been compiled to JavaScript using <a href="https://j2cl.io/">J2CL</a>. The V8 team has been collaborating with Sheets and J2CL to port that code to WasmGC, both because of the expected performance benefits for Sheets, and to provide useful real-world feedback for the WasmGC spec process. Looking at performance there, it turns out that speculative inlining is the most significant individual optimization we’ve implemented for WasmGC in V8, as the following chart shows:</p><figure><img alt="" height="371" loading="lazy" src="https://v8.dev/_img/wasm-gc-porting/benchmark2.svg" width="600" title="WasmGC latency without opts, with other opts, with speculative inlining, and with speculative inlining + other opts. The largest improvement by far is to add speculative inlining."><figcaption>Java performance with different V8 optimizations</figcaption></figure><p>“Other opts” here means optimizations aside from speculative inlining that we could disable for measurement purposes, which includes: load elimination, type-based optimizations, branch elimination, constant folding, escape analysis, and common subexpression elimination. “No opts” means we’ve switched off all of those as well as speculative inlining (but other optimizations exist in V8 which we can’t easily switch off; for that reason the numbers here are only an approximation). The very large improvement due to speculative inlining—about a <strong>30%</strong> speedup(!)—compared to all the other opts together shows how important inlining is at least on compiled Java.</p><p>Aside from speculative inlining, WasmGC builds upon the existing Wasm support in V8, which means it benefits from the same optimizer pipeline, register allocation, tiering, and so forth. In addition to all that, specific aspects of WasmGC can benefit from additional optimizations, the most obvious of which is to optimize the new instructions that WasmGC provides, such as having an efficient implementation of type casts. Another important piece of work we’ve done is to use WasmGC’s type information in the optimizer. For example, <code>ref.test</code> checks if a reference is of a particular type at runtime, and after such a check succeeds we know that <code>ref.cast</code>, a cast to the same type, must also succeed. That helps optimize patterns like this in Java:</p><pre><code><span>if</span> <span>(</span>ref <span>instanceof</span> <span>Type</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>  <span>foo</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>Type</span><span>)</span> ref<span>)</span><span>;</span> <span>// This downcast can be eliminated.</span><br><span>}</span></code></pre><p>These optimizations are especially useful after speculative inlining, because then we see more than the toolchain did when it produced the Wasm.</p><p>Overall, in WasmMVP there was a fairly clear separation between toolchain and VM optimizations: We did as much as possible in the toolchain and left only necessary ones for the VM, which made sense as it kept VMs simpler. With WasmGC that balance might shift somewhat, because as we’ve seen there is a need to do more optimizations at runtime for GC languages, and also WasmGC itself is more optimizable, allowing us to have more of an overlap between toolchain and VM optimizations. It will be interesting to see how the ecosystem develops here.</p><h2 id="demo-and-status" tabindex="-1">Demo and status <a href="#demo-and-status">#</a></h2><p>You can use WasmGC today! After reaching <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/meetings/blob/main/process/phases.md#4-standardize-the-feature-working-group">phase 4</a> at the W3C, WasmGC is now a full and finalized standard, and Chrome 119 shipped with support for it. With that browser (or any other browser that has WasmGC support; for example, Firefox 120 is expected to launch with WasmGC support later this month) you can run this <a href="https://flutterweb-wasm.web.app/">Flutter demo</a> in which Dart compiled to WasmGC drives the application’s logic, including its widgets, layout, and animation.</p><figure><img alt="" height="1471" loading="lazy" src="https://v8.dev/_img/wasm-gc-porting/flutter-wasm-demo.png" width="1812" title="Material 3 rendered by Flutter WasmGC."><figcaption>The Flutter demo running in Chrome 119.</figcaption></figure><h2 id="getting-started" tabindex="-1">Getting started <a href="#getting-started">#</a></h2><p>If you’re interested in using WasmGC, the following links might be useful:</p><ul><li>Various toolchains have support for WasmGC today, including <a href="https://flutter.dev/wasm">Dart</a>, <a href="https://github.com/google/j2cl/blob/master/docs/getting-started-j2wasm.md">Java (J2Wasm)</a>, <a href="https://kotl.in/wasmgc">Kotlin</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ocaml-wasm/wasm_of_ocaml">OCaml (wasm_of_ocaml)</a>, and <a href="https://gitlab.com/spritely/guile-hoot">Scheme (Hoot)</a>.</li><li>The <a href="https://gist.github.com/kripken/5cd3e18b6de41c559d590e44252eafff">source code</a> of the small program whose output we showed in the developer tools section is an example of writing a “hello world” WasmGC program by hand.

Traditional ports in which a VM is recompiled to Wasm will still make the most sense in some cases, but we hope that WasmGC ports will become a popular technique because of their benefits: WasmGC ports have the ability to be smaller than traditional ports—even smaller than WasmMVP programs written in C, C++, or Rust—and they integrate better with the Web on matters like cycle collection, memory use, developer tooling, and more. WasmGC is also a more optimizable representation, which can provide significant speed benefits as well as opportunities to share more toolchain effort between languages.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>We are excited to announce Audacity 3.4, which adds the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Beats and measures grid</strong>: You can now easily align your audio clips to the musical tempo and rhythm of your project. The grid shows you the subdivisions of each measure depending on your zoom level, and you can snap your clips to the nearest beat.</li>
<li><strong>Time stretching</strong>: You can now change the duration of your audio clips without affecting their pitch non-destructively. Audacity 3.4 uses a new time stretching algorithm specifically made for music, which outperforms many of the commercially available options.</li>
<li><strong>New exporter</strong>: You now have all options for exporting in a single window, including advanced options for 5.1 exporting. The exporter now features the native file browser, giving you access to all your bookmarked folders.</li>
</ul>
<p>A more detailed overview of these changes can be found in our <a href="https://support.audacityteam.org/additional-resources/changelog/audacity-3.4">changelog</a>.

<p>Amid rising community concern, Google says it will no longer develop controversial technology that was said to fight fraud online though to critics looked more like DRM for websites.</p>
<p>Instead, the Chocolate Factory plans to work on a more limited version of the tech for Android WebViews, a version of its Chrome browser that can be embedded within Android apps.</p>
<p>Google intended its <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/RupertBenWiser/Web-Environment-Integrity/blob/main/explainer.md#goals">Web Environment Integrity API</a>, announced on a developer mailing list in May, to serve as a way to limit online fraud and abuse without enabling privacy problems like cross-site tracking or browser fingerprinting.</p>

    

<p>WEI is an attestation scheme, meaning it provides a way for web servers to check the authenticity of browser clients using a cryptographic token. One of its stated goals is to "allow web servers to evaluate the authenticity of the device and honest representation of the software stack and the traffic from the device."</p>

        


        

<p>That is to say, the API would allow websites to figure out if they were being visited by a legit user in a normal browser as opposed to a page-scraping bot masquerading as a real person or some malicious software bent on fraudulently viewing and clicking on ads and doing other bad stuff.</p>
<p>To do this, the system would need to check, via attestation, whether the visitor's software and hardware stack met certain criteria and thus was authentic. That's great until it's abused to turn away visitors who have a setup a website owner isn't happy with – such as running a content blocker or video downloader.</p>
<div><p><img src="https://regmedia.co.uk/2023/07/27/examine_shutterstock.jpg?x=174&amp;amp;y=115&amp;amp;crop=1" width="174" height="115" alt="examine"></p><h2 title="'The solution to the surveillance economy seems to be more surveillance' Vivaldi boss tells El Reg">Google's browser security plan slammed as dangerous, terrible, DRM for websites</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/27/google_web_environment_integrity/"><span>PREVIOUSLY</span></a></p></div>
<p>Technical types saw this immediately, and became concerned that Google wanted to create a form of digital rights/restriction management (DRM) for the web. One benefit could be that ad fraud might be easier to prevent; but the risk is that the API could be used to limit web freedom, by giving websites or third-parties a say in the browser and software stack used by visitors.</p>
<p>Apple incidentally has already shipped its own attestation scheme called Private Access Tokens, which while it presents some of the same concerns is arguably <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://httptoolkit.com/blog/apple-private-access-tokens-attestation/">less worrisome</a> than Google's proposal because Safari's overall share of the web browser market across all devices is far lower than Chrome's.</p>

        

<p>Google also offers two more limited attestation services, the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://developer.android.com/google/play/integrity">Play Integrity API</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/app-check">Firebase App Check</a>. And its YouTube subsidiary's <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/10/26/privacy_advocate_challenges_youtube/">scanning</a> of client browsers for ad blocking extensions also represents a form of attestation or integrity check, albeit where what's evaluated is installed software rather than a cryptographic token.</p>
<p>Google's plan was to prototype the Web Environment Integrity API in Chromium, the open source foundation of Chrome as well as Edge, Brave, Vivaldi, and various other browsers – though not Firefox or Safari.</p>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/25/google_web_environment_integrity/">Google's next big idea for browser security looks like another freedom grab to some</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/09/06/google_privacy_popup_chrome/">Google Chrome pushes ahead with targeted ads based on your browser history</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/09/07/google_privacy_sandbox/">Google Chrome Privacy Sandbox open to all: Now websites can tap into your habits directly for ads</a></li>
</ul>
<p>But following the publication of a working draft <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://rupertbenwiser.github.io/Web-Environment-Integrity/">specification</a> in July, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/25/google_web_environment_integrity/">a flood</a> of critical feedback from the technical community, both on the project's issues forum and on social media channels put Google on the defensive. The Googlers involved then limited who could post comments to the project repo and public development of the project ceased.</p>
<p>Three months on, after sporadic inquiries about the project's status, Google has moderated its ambitions.</p>
<p>"We’ve heard your feedback, and the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/RupertBenWiser/Web-Environment-Integrity">Web Environment Integrity proposal</a> is no longer being considered by the Chrome team," the biz's Android team <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2023/11/increasing-trust-for-embedded-media.html">said</a> on Thursday.</p>

        

<p>The Chrome team has thus submitted <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/5001989">a commit</a> to revert the project code that had made it to the corporation's browser.</p>
<p>Instead, the Android team aims to focus on the Android WebView Media Integrity API, which provides a similar form of attestation but only for WebViews embedded in Android apps.</p>
<p>"It simply extends existing functionality on Android devices that have Google Mobile Services (GMS) and there are no plans to offer it beyond embedded media, such as streaming video and audio, or beyond Android WebViews," the Android team said.</p>
<p>The Googlers note that the ability to have Android apps embed web pages that embed media files has advantages when developing mobile apps but also affords an avenue for fraud. Unscrupulous devs can meddle with embedded content and how users interact with it. The Android WebView Media Integrity API aims to ensure that those embedding media in WebViews can have some assurance that their assets – such as streaming media – are being displayed in the app where they were embedded and not some unknown party's untrusted app.</p>
<p>Media providers interested in testing this process can <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdElIyYvTpbSvw-z_u56RXIjvPCUK11klQVveadiDdnrFd-0g/viewform">sign up</a> to join an early access program planned for next year. ®</p>

It is probably fair to say that most Linux users spend little time thinking
about the troff typesetting program, despite that application's
groundbreaking role in computing history.  Troff (along with nroff) is
still with us, though, even if they are called <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/groff/">groff</a> these days, and every
now and then they make their presence known.  A recent groff change created
a bit of a tempest within the Debian community, and has effectively been
reverted there.  It all comes down to the question of what, exactly, is the
character used to mark command-line options on Unix systems?
</p><p>
Last July, Sven Joachim <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1041731">filed a
bug report</a> regarding a change in groff, and in how it renders man pages
for terminals in particular.  A change to the handling of the character
often referred to as "hyphen", "minus", or "dash" ("<tt>-</tt>") made many
man pages rather harder to work with.  To understand the problem, it's
worth noting that Unicode provides a plethora of similar characters, some
of which are:
</p><blockquote>
<table>
<tbody><tr><th>Name</th><th>Codepoint</th><th></th></tr>
<tr><td>Hyphen-Minus</td><td>002D</td><td>-</td></tr>
<tr><td>Hyphen</td><td>2010</td><td>‐</td></tr>
<tr><td>En Dash</td><td>2013</td><td>–</td></tr>
<tr><td>Em Dash</td><td>2014</td><td>—</td></tr>
<tr><td>Minus Sign</td><td>2212</td><td>−</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</blockquote>
<p>
There are many more — Unicode is nothing if not generous in this regard.
The term "dashes" will be used to refer to this class of glyphs here.
</p><p>
The specified behavior of groff is that an ASCII
"<tt>-</tt>" (Hyphen-Minus) in the input becomes a Hyphen in the output.
If the desire is to use Hyphen-Minus in the output, then the input should
use the sequence "<tt>\-</tt>" instead.  If the author of a man page types
"<tt>--frobnicate</tt>" as an option name, the output will read
"<tt>‐‐frobnicate</tt>" (with Hyphen) rather than
"<tt>--frobnicate</tt>" (with Hyphen-Minus).  The two look the same, but
there is a crucial difference.  A user who searches for
"<tt>--frobnicate</tt>" in a man page will not find it if the wrong type of
dash is used and, if that user cuts-and-pastes an example with the wrong
dash, it will not work.
</p><p>
As an example, one can try pasting these two lines into a shell:
</p><pre>    /usr/bin/echo --help
    /usr/bin/echo ‐‐help
</pre>
<p>
The results from one will be rather more helpful than from the other.  Use
of the wrong type of dash can also break URLs and corrupt file names.
</p><p>
Developers of free software are, of course, diligent about writing man
pages; they do the job promptly, take their time to get every detail right,
and can be expected to use the right kind of dash in every situation, even
though the output from using the wrong kind looks exactly the same.  They
will surely not be bothered by the fact that a format designed to document
command-line options contains a trap whereby the failure to add backslashes
silently introduces problems for users who are distant in time and space.
</p><p>
Shockingly, this turns out not to be the case, and Linux man pages are
overflowing with unescaped dashes.  Years ago, the Debian project tried to
address this problem by adding a check to its <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/Lintian">Lintian</a> tool that would issue a
warning when unescaped dashes were used.  That check was <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=785353">dropped in
2015</a>, though, after Niels Thykier concluded that it was simply being
ignored: "<q>The tag has existed since 2004 (commit fb2e7de).  To date
there are still 2000 packages with the issue.</q>" Since then, there has
been no warning shown to Debian developers when man pages contain unescaped
dashes.
</p><p>
Given the prevalence of this problem, it would arguably make sense to apply
a fix at the processing level.  And, indeed, groff has, for many years,
duly remapped the Hyphen-Minus character (and a few others) in the man-page
macros, making dash characters simply work as many would expect.  That
helpful behavior ended with the <a href="https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/info-gnu/2023-07/msg00001.html">groff
1.23.0 release</a> in July:
</p><blockquote>
	The an (man) and doc (mdoc) macro packages no longer remap the -,
  	', and ` input characters to Basic Latin code points on UTF-8
  	devices, but treat them as groff normally does (and AT&amp;T troff
  	before it did) for typesetting devices, where they become the
  	hyphen, apostrophe or right single quotation mark, and left single
  	quotation mark, respectively.  This change is expected to expose
  	glyph usage errors in man pages.  See the "<a href="https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/groff.git/tree/PROBLEMS#n64">PROBLEMS</a>"
  	file for a recipe that will conceal these errors.  A better
  	long-term approach is for man pages to adopt correct input
  	practices
</blockquote>
<p>
Problems were indeed exposed, and users began to complain; bugs were filed
and the topic <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/debian-devel/e21c0729-0789-4079-b9a2-b9a4b1843e05@aerusso.net/">showed
up on the debian-devel mailing list</a> as well.  G. Branden Robinson, the
upstream maintainer of groff and author of this change, <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/debian-devel/20231015063029.xryij737yegdzdc2@illithid/">defended
the new behavior</a>:
</p><blockquote>
	Mapping all hyphens and minus signs to a single character, as
	people whose blood pressure spikes over this issue tend to promote
	as a first resort, is an ineluctably information-discarding
	operation.  In my opinion, man page source documents are not the
	correct place to discard that information.
</blockquote>
<p>
Among other things, the information being discarded by this change includes
whether line-breaking is allowed; Hyphen-minus does not allow it, while
Hyphen does.
</p><p>
Others disagreed with Robinson's position; Russ Allbery <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1041731#74">said</a>:
</p><blockquote>
	My opinion is that the world of documents that are handled by man
	do not encode meaningful distinctions between - and \-, and man
	should therefore unify those characters.
</blockquote>
<p>
Colin Watson, who maintains Debian's groff package, <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1041731#10">admitted</a>
that he had overlooked this problem when he updated Debian to the 1.23.0
release:
</p><blockquote>
	I was aware of the change, but it somehow fell off my list of
	things to make a positive decision about when packaging 1.23.0.
	I'm rather inclined to revert this by adding the rest of the recipe
	above to debian/mandoc.local (while I agree with the idealized
	typographical point being made, I have approximately negative
	appetite for the Sisyphean task of fixing an entire distribution's
	manual pages in practice).
</blockquote>
<p>
A few weeks later, he <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1041731#62">said</a>
that his plan was to leave the change in place during the current
Debian&nbsp;13 ("Trixie") development cycle, but then to revert it prior to
the pre-release freeze to avoid inflicting problems on Debian's users.
That would, in theory, give developers time to fix as many of the problems
as possible.  After the discussion went on for a while, though, he <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/debian-devel/ZS0aV4XyJH+O1o%2Fc@riva.ucam.org/">changed his
mind</a>, stating that he was unwilling to have his inbox filled with this
discussion for the next year.  So the remapping of "<tt>-</tt>" has been
reinstated into Debian's version of groff.
</p><p>
This little episode may well be repeated in other distributions as they
catch up with the groff 1.23.0 release.  It also is probably not finished
within Debian.  This situation brings together the problems of
documentation writing, typographic correctness, and Unicode look-alike code
points, all of which are fertile ground for disagreement.  The hopes that
removing the remapping in groff would lead to the fixing of all those man
pages may have been dashed, but that does not bar another attempt in the
future.<br clear="all"></p><hr><p>
