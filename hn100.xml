            <span>Abstract:</span>We introduce Mixtral 8x7B, a Sparse Mixture of Experts (SMoE) language model. Mixtral has the same architecture as Mistral 7B, with the difference that each layer is composed of 8 feedforward blocks (i.e. experts). For every token, at each layer, a router network selects two experts to process the current state and combine their outputs. Even though each token only sees two experts, the selected experts can be different at each timestep. As a result, each token has access to 47B parameters, but only uses 13B active parameters during inference. Mixtral was trained with a context size of 32k tokens and it outperforms or matches Llama 2 70B and GPT-3.5 across all evaluated benchmarks. In particular, Mixtral vastly outperforms Llama 2 70B on mathematics, code generation, and multilingual benchmarks. We also provide a model fine-tuned to follow instructions, Mixtral 8x7B - Instruct, that surpasses GPT-3.5 Turbo, Claude-2.1, Gemini Pro, and Llama 2 70B - chat model on human benchmarks. Both the base and instruct models are released under the Apache 2.0 license.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
<p>Are you <em>sure</em> holding it to your head really makes it better? Your experiment is very poorly designed because you have only sampled instances where the remote wasn't working when your head wasn't in the picture. This is blatant <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_bias" rel="nofollow noreferrer">selection bias</a>.</p>

<p>No doubt, putting the remote near your head (or anything else conductive) will significantly <em>alter</em> the electromagnetic radiations of the remote. But is it <em>better</em>, or just <em>different</em>? If it wasn't working to start, then you changed something, then it worked, that doesn't mean it's better. You need to also try holding it to your head, then find instances where that doesn't work, then try using the remote normally.</p>

<p>It's a common flaw in human reasoning at work here. People like to attribute success in some random or complex process to some ritual (in this case, putting the remote on your head) rather than simply realizing the success was due to an unrelated perturbation of the system, or simply another trial. Here's a familiar (at least, to people of the right age) instance of this flaw:</p>

<p><a href="http://xkcd.com/218/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Voo3d.png" alt="XKCD comic"></a></p>

<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_System" rel="nofollow noreferrer">NES</a> had game cartridges that were notoriously unreliable. The culprit was a cheaply designed electrical contact. Child wisdom had it that taking the cartridge out, vigorously blowing into the cartridge, and putting it back in would fix it. Each clan of children probably had some variation on this ritual, with important details, such as pushing the cartridge up and down a couple times, shaking the cartridge, leaving the door open, pressing the reset button multiple times, and so on. In reality, removing and re-inserting the cartridge and rebooting the NES just introduced another trial, and eventually it worked. The rest is insignificant ritual and superstition. (But don't tell any kids from the 80's that -- they won't believe you!)</p>

<p>That's not to say it's not <em>possible</em> your head does improve the remote's range. Indeed, your head will be inductively and capacitively coupled to the antenna. Significant RF currents will exist in your head, and some of this energy will be radiated, and your head will radiate differently than the antenna in the remote.</p>

<p>Perhaps, by virtue of your head's increased size, it makes a more efficient antenna. It's also possible, by virtue of your head's lower conductivity compared to copper, that it's a <em>less</em> effective antenna. It's also possible your head will act as a reflector, directing more of the radio's energy at the car. It's also possible your head will refract the waves away from the car.</p>

<p>The point is <em>we don't know</em>. All the research I've done turns up anecdotal evidence at best, by people who are not RF engineers performing similarly poorly designed experiments, or people who have talked to "an expert". I've never seen data collected by a qualified engineer with proper test equipment.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p id="e784">For those interested, let me provide more context below.</p><figure><figcaption><em>Liquidity has been a problem I wanted to solve for almost a decade. From our </em><a href="https://carta.com/blog/carta-series-a/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Series A deck</em></a><em> back in 2014.</em></figcaption></figure><p id="c81e"><strong>Nasdaq for Private Markets?</strong></p><p id="0306">We started eShares 10 years ago as the “Nasdaq for Private Markets” (we were not “the captable company”) because I wanted to solve the liquidity problem for founders, employees, and angel investors. The percentage of startups that get to IPO is so small that 99% of founders never receive liquidity and spend a decade or more paper rich but cash poor. That seemed a problem worth solving.</p><p id="9853">Fast forward to today, our business is broken down as follows: the captable business is about $250M/year, fund administration is about $100M, private equity is about $20M, and the secondary trading business is about $3M. We have done a decent job at building the captable business, an ok job at fund admin (but feeling the growing pains), and an abysmal job at the secondary business.</p><p id="03c1">It is my greatest failure and disappointment. Some of my other ideas have worked — like captables, 409As, fund administration, private equity. But ALL of my ideas around liquidity — auctions, investor matching, secondary trading, open tender offers, have not worked. I might not be the entrepreneur that can solve this problem.</p><p id="bf4c"><strong>Because We Have the Data, We Can’t Use It</strong></p><p id="4f4c">But I am learning something else — Carta might not be <em>the company</em> that can solve this problem. Many people think we are best poised to solve liquidity because we have captable data. But that same argument is used for data products. People say “You have all the data so you should put Pitchbook out of business!” But it is precisely <em>because </em>we have the data, that we can’t use it. It is our customers’ data, not ours. That’s why in ten years Carta has never released a data product. I use Pitchbook and Techcrunch when I research a company before I meet the CEO.</p><p id="efbe">Having ground truth data is not an advantage if we can’t use it. And it is a disadvantage if people think we use it. For example, if we send emails to prospects through publicly available information, how do customers know if we sourced it publicly or internally? Will they believe us if we tell them? And does it matter? Just the appearance of impropriety is damning.</p><p id="8c84"><strong>Founders Come First</strong></p><p id="ced6">From the beginning, we have always built for founders. Even in our liquidity business, the northstar has been to create systematic founder liquidity, that they control, which they can extend to everyone else on the captable. Historically, liquidity has not been founder friendly and our goal was to change that. But we have not succeeded.</p><p id="2441">We won’t do anything that threatens the trust of our founders. And so we will exit the secondary trading business to eliminate any concern that we are not acting in our founders’ best interests. We will focus on what we do best, which is cap table and fund administration software. There are many many talented people working on the private market liquidity problem. We will enthusiastically cheer for them from the sidelines. It is an important problem. I hope someone solves it.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>Apple’s limited warranty doesn’t cover damage caused by liquids, even for water-resistant products like the iPhone, Apple Watch, and some AirPods models. Because of this, Apple has different methods to detect if the device has been exposed to liquids. And on the latest Macs, Apple now has a way of knowing if liquids have been detected in the USB-C ports.</p>







<p>As noted by <em>9to5Mac</em>, <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/10/25/macos-sonoma-14-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">macOS Sonoma 14.1</a> includes a new system daemon named “liquiddetectiond,” which, as the name suggests, can identify when the computer has been exposed to liquids. More specifically, this daemon runs in the background to collect liquid detection analysis from each USB-C port on the Mac.</p>



<p>This daemon is described as a “Liquid Detection and Corrosion Mitigation Daemon.” iPhones and iPads have a similar daemon, which is used to alert users when liquid is detected in the connector so that they immediately unplug the charging cable to prevent damage.</p>



<p>On the Mac, however, the code suggests that the daemon is only used for “analytics” and is not associated with end-user features. While Apple may eventually implement an alert similar to the one that already exists in iOS, it seems more likely that the data collected by this daemon will be used for technicians to determine whether a Mac is eligible for free repair.</p>



<p>Of course, that’s just one more way for Apple to know if the Mac has been exposed to liquids. As <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201880" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple’s website describes</a>, “Mac laptop computers and some Apple wired and wireless keyboards have Liquid Contact Indicators (LCI) to help determine if these products have been exposed to liquid.”</p>

<p>These indicators are strategically placed inside the devices and change color when they come into contact with liquids. Putting a digital liquid detector on USB-C ports is just another way to ensure that technicians are right about claiming that a Mac has been exposed to liquids.</p>



<p>It’s unclear at this point whether the new daemon works with any Macs running the latest version of macOS or only with <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/10/30/new-m3-imac/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">M3 Macs</a> due to some extra hardware requirement.</p>

<p>United Airlines has found loose bolts and other parts on 737 Max 9 plug doors as it inspects its fleet of Boeing jets following the Friday rapid depressurization aboard an Alaska Airlines jet of the same make, according to three people familiar with the findings.</p>
<p>The discrepant bolts and other parts on the plug doors have been found on at least five aircraft, one of the people told <em>The Air Current</em>.</p>
<p><span>A Boeing representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokeswoman for the Federal Aviation Administration declined to comment on the United findings, and pointed to the agency’s </span><a href="https://www.faa.gov/newsroom/updates-grounding-boeing-737-max-9-aircraft"><span>earlier statements</span></a><span>.</span></p>

<p><span>United confirmed the findings in a statement, saying, “Since we began preliminary inspections on Saturday, we have found instances that appear to relate to installation issues in the door plug – for example, bolts that needed additional tightening. These findings will be remedied by our Tech Ops team to safely return the aircraft to service.”</span></p>
<p><span>The findings aboard the five United aircraft will likely significantly widen the fall-out from the grounding, intensifying the focus on Boeing and Spirit AeroSystems. The pair together is responsible for the assembly, installation and quality checks of the aircraft structure.</span></p>

<p><span>Across the five aircraft, there is little consistency in the locations of the errant parts, according to documents reviewed by </span><i><span>The Air Current.</span></i><span> In one instance, United found that the bolts that affix the lower hinge of the plug door were not fully seated, and that the washers on the bolts could “spin”.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Another aircraft was found to have loose bolts on the upper forward guide fitting on the plug and another on the forward guide roller that is an attachment point to the fuselage on the door frame. Additionally, screws that are part of the lower hinge bracket at the bottom of the plug on another aircraft were found to not be fully screwed in.</span></p>
<p><span>The five aircraft were delivered to United between November 2022 and September 2023, according to ch-aviation, and would likely not have been through a heavy maintenance C check that occurs every 4,000 to 6,000 hours or two to three years.</span></p>
<p><span>United is the only other U.S. airline to fly the 737 Max 9 and is the largest operator with 79 in its fleet. Alaska operates 65.</span></p>
<p><span>Boeing earlier Monday confirmed that it had formally distributed a Multi-Operator Message (MOM) to 737 Max 9 operators, prescribing the specific inspection criteria that would satisfy the <a href="https://theaircurrent.com/feed/dispatches/faa-orders-temporary-grounding-of-boeing-737-max-9-fleet/">emergency airworthiness directive</a> issued by the FAA on January 6, a day after the Alaska accident.</span></p>
<p><span>Alaska on Monday morning </span><a href="https://news.alaskaair.com/alaska-airlines/operations/as-1282/"><span>said</span></a><span> that before inspections could begin, the FAA would need to approve operators’ inspection processes to ensure compliance, and that the airline would need to develop detailed inspection instructions and processes for its maintenance technicians to follow. Alaska said that it canceled roughly 140 flights for Monday due to the 737 Max 9 grounding.</span></p>
<p><span>NTSB investigators announced late Sunday that they had recovered the plug that violently separated from the Alaska flight at 16,000 feet. No one was hurt in the accident.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The board has not released any specific findings related to the door or said whether the accident was in any way caused by discrepancies in the plug installation.</span></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Now, Dillin and his team have expanded that finding by discovering new details about how mitochondria in the brain communicate with cells across the worm’s body to extend life.</p>
<p>First, he had to understand why damage to the brain’s mitochondria could possibly have a beneficial effect on the organism. A mitochondrion’s process for generating energy requires exceedingly complex molecular machinery with dozens of different protein parts. When things go awry, such as when some components are missing or misfolded, mitochondria activate a stress response, known as the unfolded protein response, which delivers repair enzymes to help the complexes assemble properly and restore mitochondrial function. In this way, the unfolded protein response keeps cells healthy.</p>
<p>Dillin expected this process to unfold only inside the neurons with damaged mitochondria. Yet he observed that cells in other tissues of the worm’s body also turned on repair responses even though their mitochondria were intact.</p>

<p>It’s this repair activity that helped the worms live longer. Like taking a car to a mechanic regularly, the unfolded protein response seemed to keep cells in good running order and function as anti-aging detailing. What remained mysterious was how this unfolded protein response was communicated to the rest of the organism.</p>
<p>After some investigation, Dillin’s team discovered that the mitochondria in stressed neurons were using vesicles — bubblelike containers that move materials around the cell or between cells — to carry a signal called Wnt beyond the nerve cells to other cells in the body. Biologists already knew that Wnt plays a role in setting up the body pattern during early embryonic development, during which it also triggers repair processes like the unfolded protein response. Still, how could Wnt signaling, when turned on in an adult, avoid activating the embryonic program?</p>
<p>Dillin suspected that there had to be another signal that Wnt interacted with. After further work, the researchers discovered that a gene expressed in the mitochondria of the germline — and in no other mitochondria — can interrupt Wnt’s developmental processes. That result suggested to him that <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.08.21.554217v2">germline cells play critical roles</a> in relaying the Wnt signal between the nervous system and tissues throughout the rest of the body.</p>
<p>“The&nbsp;germline is absolutely essential&nbsp;for this,” Dillin said. It isn’t clear, however, whether the germline mitochondria act as amplifiers, receiving the signal from the brain’s mitochondria and transmitting it to other tissues, or if the receiving tissues are “listening” for signals from both sources.</p>
<p>Either way, the strength of the germline signal regulates the organism’s life span, Dillin said. As a worm ages, the quality of its eggs or sperm declines — what we refer to as the ticking of a biological clock. The decline is also reflected in the germ cells’ changing ability to transmit signals from the brain’s mitochondria, he suggested. As the worm grows older, its germline transmits the repair signal less effectively, and so its body declines, too.</p>

<p>Scientists don’t yet know whether these findings apply to humans and how we age. Still, the hypothesis makes sense from a broader evolutionary standpoint, Dillin said. As long as the germ cells are healthy, they send pro-survival signals to ensure that their host organism survives to reproduce. But as the quality of the germ cells declines, there is no evolutionary reason to keep extending life span further; from evolution’s perspective, life exists to reproduce itself.</p>
<p>The fact that mitochondria can talk among themselves might seem somewhat alarming, but there is an explanation. Long ago, mitochondria were free-living bacteria that joined forces with another type of primitive cell to work together in what became our modern complex cells. So, their ability to communicate is probably a relic from the free-living bacterial ancestor of mitochondria.</p>
<p>“This little thing that’s been ticking inside of cells for billions of years still retains its bacterial origins,” Dillin said. And if his research in worms holds up in more complex organisms like humans, it’s possible that your mitochondria are talking right now about your age.</p>

<h2 id="about">About</h2>
<p>'<strong>Как пропатчить KDE2 под FreeBSD?</strong>' or '<strong>How does one patch KDE2 under FreeBSD?</strong>' is a phrase largely confined to Russian and East European <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/cultures/the-internet">Internet</a> culture.</p>
<p>Since its inception, 'Как пропатчить KDE2 под FreeBSD?' has gained some media coverage for being publicly answered by Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev and Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko.</p>
<p>'KDE2' refers to the 'K Desktop Environment', a community of open source applications, and 'FreeBSD' refers to the open source operating system.</p>

<em>RusNet</em> and <em>Bash</em>
</h3>
<p>On May 8th, 2004, Alexander Kosyrin, a prominent Russian enthusiast of Japanese animation, or '<em>animeshnikov</em>', known as <a href="http://dead-persimmon.livejournal.com/" target="_blank">'DEAD_PERSIMMON'</a> on <em><a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/sites/livejournal">LiveJournal</a></em> and 'Sashok' on <em>Internet Relay Chat</em>, initiated a satirical conversation on the '#<a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/cultures/anime-manga">anime</a>' channel of <em>RusNet</em>, Eastern Europe's and Central Asia's largest <em>Internet Relay Chat</em> network.</p>
<p>The following quotation is a simplification of the actual conversation.</p>
<p>In Russian,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sashok: Здравствуйте, это канал об аниме?<br>
Да.<br>
Sashok: Как мне пропатчить KDE2 под FreeBSD?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In English,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sashok: Hello, is this the '#anime' channel?<br>
Yes.<br>
Sashok: How does one patch KDE2 under FreeBSD?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alexander Kosyrin intended to satirize the community of the '#anime' channel of <em>RusNet</em>, which was composed of enthusiasts of computer programming, network administration, and information technology who seldom discussed Japanese animation, preferring to discuss more 'geeky' topics. For humorous purposes, Alexander Kosyrin acknowledged that the channel was '#anime' but posted the irrelevant message anyways, instead of posting in the more appropriate '#freebsd', '#unix', or '#kde' channels.</p>
<p>On August 30th, 2004, <a href="http://bash.org.ru/quote/42" target="_blank">the quotation was submitted to and accepted by 'www.bash.org.ru'</a> <sup id="fnr1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup>, a website similar to 'www.bash.org' as they both serve as archives of <em>Internet Relay Chat</em> conversations. The quotation became popular on the website with a score of 62,214 and spawned numerous popular derivatives, such as <a href="http://bash.org.ru/quote/2671" target="_blank">this</a> ,</p>
<p>In Russian,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>moontiger: мне нравятся лозунги типа "рок против наркотиков"<br>
moontiger: и "панк против водки"<br>
moontiger: ну там "скины против расизма"<br>
moontiger: и еще "готы против суицида"<br>
moontiger: а также "сатанизм против люцифера"<br>
moontiger: ну и, конечно, "КАМ против кефира"<br>
moontiger: [в угоду колену] "анимешники против KDE2 под FreeBSD"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In English,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>moontiger: I like slogans like "Rock Against Drugs"<br>
moontiger: And "Punks Against Vodka"<br>
moontiger: And there's "Skinheads Against Racism"<br>
moontiger: And even "Goths Against Suicide"<br>
moontiger: And "Satanists Against Lucifer"<br>
moontiger: And of course, "KAM Against Kafir"<br>
moontiger: And "Anime Fans Against KDE2 Under FreeBSD"</p>

<h3 id="livejournal"><em>LiveJournal</em></h3>
<p>On October 16th, 2005, A group of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaschenism" target="_blank">pseudo-Jewish trolls called Kaschenists</a> <sup id="fnr2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup> formed a <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/kde2podfreebsd/" target="_blank"><em>LiveJournal</em> group called 'kde2podfreebsd'</a> which dedicated itself to <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/cultures/trolling">trolling</a> enthusiasts of Japanese animation by frequently mentioning 'How does one patch KDE2 under FreeBSD?' as seen <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/kde2podfreebsd/1527.html" target="_blank">here</a> .</p>
<p><a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/57429" target="_blank"><img src="https://a.kym-cdn.com/assets/blank-b3f96f160b75b1b49b426754ba188fe8.gif" alt="kde2podfreebsd" id="photo_57429" title="722_big.jpg" data-src="https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/057/429/722_big.jpg"></a> </p>
<p>As a result, strict rules were implemented in the '#anime' channel of <em>RusNet</em> and in the <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/ru_anime" target="_blank"><em>LiveJournal</em> group 'ru_anime'</a> which prohibited any mention of KDE2 or FreeBSD in a humorous context.</p>
<h3 id="russian-president-vladimir-putin">Russian President Vladimir Putin</h3>
<p>Russian President <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/people/vladimir-putin">Vladimir Putin</a> was scheduled to appear at a conference on July 6th, 2006 in which Internet users could submit and vote on questions <a href="http://president.yandex.ru/" target="_blank">here</a> . In the <a href="http://president.yandex.ru/theme.xml?id=76" target="_blank">'Internet Connection' category</a> , some humorous questions were submitted.</p>
<p><a href="http://president.yandex.ru/question.xml?id=155546" target="_blank">The most popular question</a> <sup id="fnr3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup> with 28,424 votes, submitted by Кросавчег, 19, of Moscow, was,</p>
<p>In Russian,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ПРЕВЕД, Владимир Владимирович! Как вы относитесь к МЕДВЕДУ?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In English,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello, Vladimir Putin! What do you think of bear?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://president.yandex.ru/question.xml?id=194536" target="_blank">The third most popular question</a> , submitted by Серега, 27, of Tambov, was,</p>
<p>In Russian,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Товарищ Президент как мне пропатчить KDE2 под FreeBSD?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In English,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Comrade President, how does one patch KDE2 under FreeBSD?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite the questions' popularity, neither question was answered.</p>

 <h3 id="kazakh-president-nursultan-nazarbayev">Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev</h3>
<p>In a similar conference held on June 7th, 2007, Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev was asked the most popular question, which was <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070927194049/http://e.gov.kz/online/showCard.jsp?id=424" target="_blank">this</a> ,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How does one patch KDE2 under FreeBSD?<br>
47,955 votes</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nursultan Nazarbayev managed to answer the question seriously, saying,</p>
<p>In Kazakh,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ответ на этот вопрос лежит в чисто технической плоскости. Могу сказать, что в Казахстане сейчас усиленно развивается национальная индустрия программного обеспечения и думаю, что решения, основанные на технологии Open Source имеют право на жизнь. Существует проект Национальной защищённой операционной системы в рамках государственной программы формирования электронного правительства, которая сейчас реализуется Агентством РК по информатизации и связи. Думаю, что подобные проекты достаточно перспективны. В связи с этим возникают определённые проблемы с подготовкой специалистов в соответствующих областях, но они все решаемы. Существуют курсы по изучению программного обеспечения Open Source, на которых можно получить соответствующие знания." Кроме того, считаю целесообразным упомянуть об истории возникновения вопроса. Данный вопрос был задан 8 мая 2004 года на чате #anime (аниме – японский жанр мультипликации) видимо в шутку, частично связанную с тем, что в числе почитателей аниме (анимешников) много unix-администраторов. по другой версии вопрос был серьёзно задан лицом, не знающим, что такое аниме, но предполагающим, что чат посвящён вопросам администрирования unix. С тех пор шутка приобрела большую популярность.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In English,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The answer to this question is purely technical. I can say that Kazakhstan is now vigorously developing its own software industry and I think that solutions based on open source technologies should be considered. There is a state program for e-government which is now being implemented by the State Agency of Information and Communication. I think that such projects are quite promising. In this regard, there are certain problems with the training of specialists in relevant fields, but they are all being solved. There are courses on open source software where you can get such knowledge. <br>
Also, I consider it appropriate to mention the history of the issue. This question was asked on May 8, 2004 on the chat #anime (anime – Japanese animation), apparently in jest, partly associated with the fact that these anime lovers (animeshnikov) were also UNIX administrators. It was asked by someone wanting to discuss anime, but I suppose that the discussion was devoted to UNIX administration. Since then, the joke has become very popular.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Reuters</em> wrote of the bizarre queries on June 1st, 2007, in an article titled <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL0131903220070601" target="_blank">'Kazakhs shower president with cryptic questions'</a> , which noted,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The cryptic software question -- "How does one patch KDE under FreeBSD?" -- appeared to be the most popular query posted on the webcast site, with more that 11,000 people asking for it to be forwarded to the 66-year-old leader.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>[…]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin faced a similar question and answer session on the Internet last year when Russians asked their leader questions such as whether he planned to employ "giant, humanoid war robots".</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>[…]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>More than 9,000 people wanted to know "when the authorities will start chopping off civil servants' tongues for lying to the president in the most outrageous way", was the portal's second-most favorite question as of Friday evening.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>One user, backed by more than 2,000 votes and identified as Aizhan, asked: "What is your mobile phone number? Can I call you directly?"</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="ukrainian-president-viktor-yushchenko">Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko</h3>

<p>On December 28th, 2007, another similar conference was conducted for Ukrainian President Viktor Ushchenko in which Internet users could submit and vote on questions <a href="http://president2007.pravda.com.ua/" target="_blank">here</a> . The <a href="http://president2007.pravda.com.ua/view_popular/" target="_blank">most popular question</a> , which gained 37,627 votes, was submitted by Нестор on December 24th, 2007,</p>
<p>In Ukrainian,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Пане Президенте? Як пропатчити KDE2 під FreeBSD?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In English,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mr. President? How does one patch KDE2 under FreeBSD?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Viktor Yushchenko <a href="http://president2007.pravda.com.ua/answers/" target="_blank">provided the following answer</a> <sup id="fnr4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup>,</p>
<p>In Ukrainian,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Уважаемые друзья, пропатчить могут помочь программисты Секретариата Президента в разных операционных системах.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In English,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear friends, the programmers at the Presidential Secretariat can patch KDE2 in different operating systems. The second option would be to use newer software that does not confuse users.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His 'second option' likely refers to fact that KDE2 became outdated when KDE3 was released on April 3rd, 2002.</p>

 <h3 id="microsoft-president-steve-ballmer">
<em>Microsoft</em> President Steve Ballmer</h3>
<p>According to <a href="http://lurkmore.ru/%D0%9F%D0%B0%D1%82%D1%87%D0%B8%D1%82%D1%8C_KDE2_%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%B4_FreeBSD" target="_blank">'www.lurkmore.ru'</a> , the sixth most popular question on the 2008 <em>Microsoft</em> <a href="http://remix.ru/" target="_blank"> Russian website for its annual <em>Remix</em></a> conference was 'How does one patch KDE2 under FreeBSD?' which was posted by Ilya Agapov of Toshkivka, Ukraine. The high-ranking question won Ilya Agapov an invitation to the conference. However, he gave the invitation to his friend, who then received an <em><a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/subcultures/xbox">XBox</a> 360</em> at the conference. The question was not asked to Steve Ballmer, likely due to its reference to competing products and irrelevant subject.</p>
<h3 id="current-status">Current Status</h3>
<p>While 'Как пропатчить KDE2 под FreeBSD?' is popular on the 'Runet', or 'Russian Internet', it remains obscure in the Anglosphere, though a <a href="http://www.google.ca/search?q=how+does+one+patch+kde2+under+freebsd&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=HCUvTOeQKMShnQfL8ZX5CA&amp;start=0&amp;sa=N" target="_blank"><em></em></a><em><a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/sites/google">Google</a> Search</em> for 'How does one patch KDE2 under FreeBSD?' does reveal some trolling on support forums<sup id="fnr5"><a href="#fn5">[5]</a></sup>.</p>
<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
<p id="fn1"><sup><a href="#fnr1">[1]</a></sup> <span>Some found it notable that the URL under which the quotation is kept ends in "42", resulting in comparisons to <em>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</em>.</span></p>
<p id="fn2"><sup><a href="#fnr2">[2]</a></sup> <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaschenism" target="_blank">'Kaschenism'</a> , named after <em>Kaschenko Psychiatric Hospital</em> and Doctor Pyotr Kashchenko, is an elaborate form of trolling in which the troll pretends to be Jewish and uses Hebrew terms in order to provoke anti-Semites through a policy of strict political correctness. The troll also imitates either a medical staff or a medical patient by using psychiatric terms. They inhabit 'www.kaschenko.ru', which is in both <a href="http://www.kaschenko.ru/ShMuZ/viewforum.php?f=98" target="_blank">English</a> and <a href="http://www.kaschenko.ru/ShMuZ/index.php" target="_blank">Russian</a> .</span></p>
<p id="fn3"><sup><a href="#fnr3">[3]</a></sup> <span><a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/preved-medved">'ПРЕВЕД МЕДВЕДУ'</a> is another Russian meme. 'ПРЕВЕД', or 'Preved', is an exclamation meaning 'Hello!' and is a mispelling of 'Privet' while 'МЕДВЕДУ', or Medved, means 'Bear' and is a misspelling of 'медведь'. When read together, it means 'The Hello Bear'. However in this context, 'МЕДВЕДУ' may be a humorous reference to Prime Minister Dimitri Medvedev, whose surname is derived from 'Medved' and means 'Bear'.</span></p>
<p id="fn4"><sup><a href="#fnr4">[4]</a></sup> <span>When speaking, Viktor Yushchenko mistakenly said 'operational scheme' instead of 'operating system'. This was corrected in the <a href="http://president2007.pravda.com.ua/answers/" target="_blank">official textual transcript</a> .</span></p>
<p id="fn5"><sup><a href="#fnr5">[5]</a></sup> <span>According to <a href="http://lurkmore.ru/%D0%9F%D0%B0%D1%82%D1%87%D0%B8%D1%82%D1%8C_KDE2_%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%B4_FreeBSD" target="_blank">'www.lurkmore.ru'</a> , the correct answer to 'How does one patch KDE2 under FreeBSD?' is 'Because the use of the newest FreeBSD requires the newest version of the library qt, namely qt3, ports on the KDE2 system will require tremendous efforts from programmers. It is recommended to upgrade to KDE3'.</span></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
                    <div id="post-wrapper">
                            <p>Last week I got a message from my dad (who works with me at a client) with an image attached.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://pictshare.net/hdkhikv83m.png"><figcaption>Message from dad</figcaption></figure>
<p>I asked him to unplug it, store it in a safe location, take photos of all parts and to make an image from the SD card (since I mostly work remote). I have worked on many Raspberry Pi projects and I felt confident I could find out what it does.</p>
<p>At this point nobody thought it was going to be malicious, more like one of our staffers was playing around with something.</p>
<h2>The parts</h2>
<p>There were 3 parts: </p>
<ul>
<li>A Raspberry Pi b first generation</li>
<li>a mysterious USB dongle</li>
<li>a 16GB sd card (a fast one)</li>
</ul>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://pictshare.net/gfss00puet.jpg"><figcaption>USB dongle and SD card</figcaption></figure>
<h2>First thing to do: Ask everybody who can access this network closet</h2>
<p>The number of people who can access this small cabinet is very limited. Only 4 people have a key for this room:</p>
<ol>
<li>The manager</li>
<li>The groundskeeper</li>
<li>My co-worker</li>
<li>Me</li>
</ol>
<p>None of them knew anything about this so I asked my IT colleagues and they were as baffled as I was. I heard of people getting paid to put things like this in places they shouldn't and for this reason I was very interested in finding out what it actually does.</p>
<h2>What is that USB dongle though?</h2>
<p>To help me solve this mistery <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/9xveq5/rogue_raspberrypi_found_in_network_closet_need/">I asked reddit</a> and surely enough they identified the dongle as a microprocessor, almost as powerful as the Rasberry Pi itself: the <a href="https://wiki.makerdiary.com/nrf52832-mdk/">nRF52832-MDK</a>. A very powerful wifi, bluetooth and RFID reader.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://pictshare.net/lrc3fnqrl7.jpg"><figcaption>The nRF52832-MDK usb dongle</figcaption></figure>
<p>This was - no doubt - to give the old Raspberry Pi a wifi and bluetooth connection. Great so now this thing has wifi too..</p>
<h2>Time to dissect the SD card image</h2>
<p>The SD card has a few partitions. Most ext4 (linux) and one fat16 (boot)</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://pictshare.net/htpg3y9xhu.png"><figcaption>GParted view of the image</figcaption></figure>
<p>Great, time to mount it.</p>
<p>My debian box told me the first big clue: It's a resin installation</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.pictshare.net/wt9hqp.png"><figcaption>Resin partitions on the SD Card</figcaption></figure>
<h2>WTF is Resin?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.balena.io/">Resin (now renamed to Balena)</a> is a paid <a href="https://www.balena.io/what-is-balena">IOT web service</a> where you can generate images for IOT devices, deploy those devices and get updates and data from and to resin.</p>
<p>Resin also installs a VPN on the device so the collected data is transferred securely. Obviously this device was meant to be picked up again since it leaves a trail as the service is a paid one.</p>
<h2>Closer look at the partitions</h2>
<p>First partition is called <strong>"resin-boot"</strong> </p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.pictshare.net/n7rq00.png"></figure>
<p>See something that catches your eye? We got a <code>config.json</code>. Quick jackpot?</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.pictshare.net/y9tq3d93ru.png"><figcaption>config.json on the resin-boot partition</figcaption></figure>
<p>What we can extract from this file:</p>
<ol>
<li>The application deployed to this resin device is called <strong>"logger"</strong>. Not a good sign</li>
<li>We got a <strong>username</strong>. This seems to be the username for the resin account associated with this device</li>
<li>Confirmation that the device used a <strong>VPN</strong> via Port 443</li>
<li>A registration date. It was registered (or first deployed or set up?) on <strong>May 13th 2018</strong></li>
</ol>
<h3>About that username..</h3>
<p>When I googled the username found in the config.json file I found a person in the same town where this Pi was found. The company then checked their records for this person but found nothing.</p>
<p>Oddly enough I found a website from 2001 where parents of "gifted children" write articles about them and for some reason sign those articles with their home address and phone numbers. So I have a name and the address of this whole family.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://pictshare.net/800/9drvd1.jpg"><figcaption>Not the actual site but a similar one</figcaption></figure>
<p>This could be a wrong lead as usernames tend to be used by multiple people but let's just keep that name in mind.</p>
<h3>resin-data</h3>
<p>The data directory didn't have any data stored (as in: <em>collected data</em>) but there was a nodejs app which was heavily obfuscated and to this day I can't tell exactly what it was doing. It seems to talk via a serial connection to the dongle but I can't extract what data is actually collected. I can only assume that it collected movement profiles of bluetooth and wifi devices in the area (around the Managers office) and maybe raw wifi packets.</p>
<p>But I found something much more interesting: a <code>LICENSE.md</code> file</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.pictshare.net/7ora0e.png"><figcaption>Screenshot of the LICENSE.md file</figcaption></figure>
<p>Odd.. Why would this nodejs app include a confidential piece of software? I googled the company from the copyright header and guess what? </p>
<h2>The guy from the username I found in the config file is a part owner</h2>
<p>It is beyond me why a co-founder of a company would distribute these devices around town but well..</p>
<hr>
<h2>Getting the attackers home address</h2>
<p>Another very interesting thing I found was a file on the third partition (<code>resin-state</code>) in the path <code>/root-overlay/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/</code>. The file is called <strong>resin-wifi-01</strong> and guess what it contains?</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.pictshare.net/8vdh9k.png"></figure>
<p>It contains the wifi credentials to the wifi that was used to set the device up (or to test it). Definitely not the wifi of the company. And what do we do, when we want to find out a location associated with a wifi name? We go to wigle.net, enter the SSID (=wifi name) and it tells us where on the world it is found.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.pictshare.net/6ztf78.png"><figcaption>not the actual name and not the actual location</figcaption></figure>
<p>And guess what? The address we found of that gifted persons parents? <strong>That's exactly where our Pi was set up</strong> according to Wigle.net</p>
<h2>Aftermath</h2>
<h2>How and when did the Pi even get there?</h2>
<p>I checked the DNS logs and found the exact date and time when the Pi was first seen in the network. I checked the RADIUS logs to see which employee was at the premises at that time and I saw multiple error messages that a deactivated account tried to connect to wifi.</p>
<p>That deactivated account belongs to an ex employee who (for some reason) made a deal with management that he could still have a key for a few months until he moved all his stuff out of the building (don't ask..).</p>
<h2>What now</h2>
<p>Legal has taken over, I did my part and the rest is over my pay grade.</p>
<p>For me it was a very interesting challenge and I'd like to thank every person on reddit who helped me with one piece of the puzzle.</p>

			<h2>The Eight Golden Rules of Interface Design</h2>
			<p>I have often been asked to distill the vast corpus of user interface design into a few key principles. While I was reluctant to do this, it turned out to be a good exercise to write “Golden Rules,” that are applicable in most interactive systems. These principles, derived from experience and refined over three decades, require validation and tuning for specific design domains. No list such as this can be complete, but even the original list from 1985, has been well received as a useful guide to students and designers. Jakob Nielsen, Jeff Johnson, and others have expanded these rules and included their variations, which enriches the discussion. Each edition of the book produces some changes. This version is from Section 3.3.4 of the Sixth edition:<br>

				Shneiderman, B., Plaisant, C., Cohen, M., Jacobs, S., and Elmqvist, N., Designing the User Interface: Strategies for Effective Human-Computer Interaction: Sixth Edition, Pearson (May 2016) <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/DTUI6">http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/DTUI6</a></p>

			<h3>1. Strive for consistency.</h3>
			<p>Consistent sequences of actions should be required in similar situations; identical terminology should be used in prompts, menus, and help screens; and consistent color, layout, capitalization, fonts, and so on, should be employed throughout. Exceptions, such as required confirmation of the delete command or no echoing of passwords, should be comprehensible and limited in number</p>
 
			<h3>2. Seek universal usability.</h3>
			<p>Recognize the needs of diverse users and design for plasticity, facilitating transformation of content. Novice to expert differences, age ranges, disabilities, international variations, and technological diversity each enrich the spectrum of requirements that guides design. Adding features for novices, such as explanations, and features for experts, such as shortcuts and faster pacing, enriches the interface design and improves perceived quality.</p>
 
			<h3>3. Offer informative feedback.</h3>
			<p>For every user action, there should be an interface feedback. For frequent and minor actions, the response can be modest, whereas for infrequent and major actions, the response should be more substantial. Visual presentation of the objects of interest provides a convenient environment for showing changes explicitly (see the discussion of direct manipulation in Chapter 7).</p>
 
			<h3>4. Design dialogs to yield closure.</h3>
			<p>Sequences of actions should be organized into groups with a beginning, middle, and end. Informative feedback at the completion of a group of actions gives users the satisfaction of accomplishment, a sense of relief, a signal to drop contingency plans from their minds, and an indicator to prepare for the next group of actions. For example, e-commerce websites move users from selecting products to the checkout, ending with a clear confirmation page that completes the transaction.</p>
 
			<h3>5. Prevent errors.</h3>
			<p>As much as possible, design the interface so that users cannot make serious errors; for example, gray out menu items that are not appropriate and do not allow alphabetic characters in numeric entry fields (Section 3.3.5). If users make an error, the interface should offer simple, constructive, and specific instructions for recovery. For example, users should not have to retype an entire name-address form if they enter an invalid zip code but rather should be guided to repair only the faulty part. Erroneous actions should leave the interface state unchanged, or the interface should give instructions about restoring the state.</p>
 
			<h3>6. Permit easy reversal of actions.</h3>
			<p>As much as possible, actions should be reversible. This feature relieves anxiety, since users know that errors can be undone, and encourages exploration of unfamiliar options. The units of reversibility may be a single action, a data-entry task, or a complete group of actions, such as entry of a name-address block.</p>
 
			<h3>7. Keep users in control.</h3>
			<p>Experienced users strongly desire the sense that they are in charge of the interface and that the interface responds to their actions. They don’t want surprises or changes in familiar behavior, and they are annoyed by tedious data-entry sequences, difficulty in obtaining necessary information, and inability to produce their desired result.</p>
 
			<h3>8. Reduce short-term memory load.</h3>
			<p>Humans’ limited capacity for information processing in short-term memory (the rule of thumb is that people can remember “seven plus or minus two chunks” of information) requires that designers avoid interfaces in which users must remember information from one display and then use that information on another display. It means that cellphones should not require reentry of phone numbers, website locations should remain visible, and lengthy forms should be compacted to fit a single display. </p>
 
			<p>These underlying principles must be interpreted, refined, and extended for each environment. They have their limitations, but they provide a good starting point for mobile, desktop, and web designers. The principles presented in the ensuing sections focus on increasing users’ productivity by providing simplified data-entry procedures, comprehensible displays, and rapid informative feedback to increase feelings of competence, mastery, and control over the system.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
            <p>What are the trade-offs between different kinds of CRDTs (Conflict-free Replicated Data Types)? Most introductory talks cover just state-based and operations-based CRDTs because that's what the original paper formulated. But since then, there have been other variations, and I haven't seen much written about them in blog posts, so I'll cover their trade-offs here. </p><ul><li><a href="https://www.bartoszsypytkowski.com/the-state-of-a-state-based-crdts/">State-based CRDTs</a> (convergent CRDTs)</li><li><a href="https://www.bartoszsypytkowski.com/operation-based-crdts-protocol/">Operation-based CRDTs</a> (commutative CRDTs)</li><li><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.2803.pdf">δ-state-based CRDTs</a></li><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230607175939/https://novasys.di.fct.unl.pt/~alinde/publications/a12-van_der_linde.pdf">Δ-state-based CRDTs</a></li></ul><p>The basics of <a href="https://crdt.tech/">CRDTs</a> are covered in a lot of other different places [^1], so I won't try to speed run it here. Let's just jump into the differences.</p><h2 id="state-based-crdts-convergent-crdts">State-based CRDTs (Convergent CRDTs)</h2><p>In State-based CRDTs, a replica's state can be updated by a merge operation with another replica's state. But if the <a href="https://architecturenotes.co/fallacies-of-distributed-systems/">network is unreliable and can deliver events out of order</a>, how would all the replicas achieve convergence and agreement of all their states? The trick is simply to restrict ourselves to data structures and operations that are immune to net-splits and out-of-order delivery. </p><p>First, the internal data structure of the CRDT must be monotonically increasing. Second, the merge operation has to be commutative, associative, and idempotent with respect to the internal data structures.</p><p>These constraints make the CRDT immune to the unreliable network. As long as all replicas eventually see every state update event, they're guaranteed to converge to the same state. Due to the use of vector clocks, replicas coming in and out of the network are easily handled. The internal bookkeeping grows linearly with the number of replicas.</p><p>The rest of the design problem is how to build useful data structures out of only monotonically increasing elements. Luckily, there is already a <a href="https://github.com/pfrazee/crdt_notes/tree/68c5fe81ade109446a9f4c24e03290ec5493031f#portfolio-of-basic-crdts">menagerie of CRDTs</a> that can model numbers, arrays, maps, strings, and other common data structures.</p><p>State-based CRDTs are theoretically sound, but in practice, it has a glaring downside: they require sending the entire state of a replica over the network to other replicas. This can be prohibitive for all but the smallest states like counters and registers. That's because a CRDT needs to maintain internal bookkeeping of "which replica said what" at some logical time in order to resolve conflicts for any new state changes. The end-user queries this internal bookkeeping for a current value, like a functional view calculated from the actual state, the internal bookkeeping. For anything beyond a counter or register, this internal bookkeeping can be too big for sets and maps. And as the number of replicas grows, it can grow too big too quickly.</p><p>Therefore, most current CRDT implementations are not state-based but op-based. </p><div><p>💡</p><p>- Uses merge function to converge<br>- Merge function needs to be commutative, associative, and idempotent<br>- Internal data structure needs to be monotonically increasing</p></div><div><p>👍</p><p>- Easy syncing protocol that just broadcasts new state to other replicas<br>- Does not need to keep a history to sync (as we'll see later)</p></div><div><p>👎</p><p>- Sending the entire state over the wire is impractical for all but the simplest CRDTs<br>- Internal data structure grows linearly with the number of replicas<br>- Harder to accommodate replicas that come in and out of the network</p></div><h2 id="operation-based-crdts-commutative-crdts">Operation-based CRDTs (Commutative CRDTs)</h2><p>Current practical implementations of CRDTs opt for a way to ship smaller pieces of data over the wire while retaining the same properties as a state-based CRDT. We will give up a merge function and instead use a defined set of operations that can be used on the state. It's akin to defining <a href="https://guide.elm-lang.org/effects/">a command in an effect system</a>. Like before, the operations will need to be constrained to give us the property of uncoordinated syncing between replicas. The operations will need to be both commutative and associative, but unlike the merge function, they do not have to be idempotent.</p><p>Without idempotency, the syncing protocol now cannot just be an out-of-order delivery of updates like in state-based CRDTs. Instead, we require the operations to be delivered in causal order. When a replica syncs and catches up to the latest state, the operations are applied in causal order. Any concurrent operations will result in the same state, due to the commutative and associative properties of the operations. We're shifting part of the complexity of the merge function into the sync protocol.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Our internal bookkeeping to converge to the same state with concurrent operations doesn't use vector clocks. Instead, we can keep a log of the causal history of all the operations that occurred. Our internal bookkeeping no longer grows with the number of replicas, but instead with the number of events. </p><p>Op-based CRDTs can scale easily with the number of replicas and with an unknown number of replicas that come in and out of the network easily. However, like blockchains, it has an ever-growing internal bookkeeping if it wants to allow any replica to sync regardless of how long it has been offline.</p><p>There are two ways to address this ever-growing bookkeeping. One or the other may be feasible depending on the requirements of your application. </p><p>The first is to adopt what accountants do: close books at the end of every month and quarter. All replicas keep a rolling window of the latest N days of data and throw away data that's older than N days. And if a replica has been offline longer than a certain number of days, then they cannot be expected to sync and will need to reload from the latest. </p><p>The second is to keep all the history, but find ways to compress it. This is what the CRDT library <a href="https://youtu.be/x7drE24geUw?si=syBk3NTxeDQekk30&amp;t=3201">Automerge does</a>. This can sound like a bad idea, but we already have software that keeps its entire history around that developers use every day: <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-Objects">Git</a>. Of course, not all application requirements allow us to do this, but in my opinion, we don't do enough of it. Disks are comparatively cheap now, and the <a href="https://interjectedfuture.com/persistent-data-structure-redux/">benefits of immutability</a> far outweigh the downsides.</p><p>To query for the value of an op-based CRDT, we can apply all operations from the history log to an empty state to get the current state. Alternatively, we can keep a cache of the latest state in memory and update it on every operation.</p><div><p>💡</p><p>- Applies operations to converge state<br>- Operations need to be commutative and associative<br>- Internal data structure needs to be monotonically increasing</p></div><div><p>👍</p><p>- Small amount of data sent over the network to sync<br>- Easier to accommodate replicas that come in and out of the network<br>- Data is immutable, hence diffs, undos, and comparisons are easy.</p></div><div><p>👎</p><p>- Syncing protocol needs to implement causal delivery of operations <br>- Internal data structure is a history of operations that grows linearly with the number of operations</p></div><h2 id="delta-state-crdts">Delta-state CRDTs</h2><p>Delta-state CRDTs try to solve the data-over-the-wire problem differently. Instead of breaking the merge function into operations to send over the wire, we try to calculate the minimum amount of state to send to other replicas to sync.</p><p>There are two versions of delta-state CRDTs. In the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.2803.pdf">first δ-state CRDT paper</a>, we do something similar to op-based CRDTs: we create a set of operations, called delta-mutators) that are used to update the state. But instead of sending these operations over the wire, delta-mutators generate a diff between the states before the delta-mutator was applied and after it was applied. The diff is then stored in a buffer to be sent out to all other replicas. </p><p>But this buffer isn't a queue. The buffer holds the diff between the current state and the state when the buffer was last sent to other replicas. This is possible because the delta-mutator diffs are composable. This means if we have two diffs, d<sub>12</sub> (a diff between State X<sub>1</sub> and State X<sub>2</sub>) and d<sub>23</sub> (a diff between State X<sub>2</sub> and State X<sub>3</sub>), the composition of the two diffs would be D<sub>13</sub> (computed with d<sub>12</sub> ⨆ d<sub>23</sub>). Hence, the application of d<sub>12</sub> and then d<sub>23</sub> is the same as the application of the composition D<sub>13</sub>. The paper calls these compositions, delta-groups. </p><p>And because the diffs exist in the same join-semilattice as the states, you can use the same merge function to merge the diffs received from other replicas into your own local state.</p><p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230607175939/https://novasys.di.fct.unl.pt/~alinde/publications/a12-van_der_linde.pdf">second Δ-state paper</a> takes a slightly different approach. While the 𝛿-state CRDT has a replica send the same diff to all other replicas, in the Δ-state CRDT, we notice that the information about which replica has which part of the state is already encoded in the vector clock internal bookkeeping of the CRDTs. Hence, we can tailor the diff that we send to each replica. Therefore, we can toss the buffer and calculate the exact diff of the state that another replica needs. But by trading off the buffer, you now need to keep track of tombstones.</p><p>Delta-CRDTs retain the idempotency property of state-based CRDTs but do not require lots of bandwidth to sync replicas. </p><div><p>💡</p><p>- Merge either full state or deltas to converge<br>- Merge function needs to be commutative, associative, and idempotent<br>- Internal data structure needs to be monotonically increasing</p></div><div><p>👍</p><p>- Small amount of data sent over the network to sync<br>- Syncing protocol is simple and just needs to broadcast to all other replicas</p></div><div><p>👎</p><p>- Internal data structure grows with the number of replicas<br>- Internal data structure can get complex, like using <a href="https://www.bartoszsypytkowski.com/optimizing-state-based-crdts-part-2/">Dots</a>.<br>- Merge function implementation can get complex.</p></div><h2 id="the-search-continues">The Search Continues</h2><p>While all of these CRDTs have strengths and weaknesses, I'm looking for something where I don't have to compromise.

<p>5 January 2024</p>
<p><img title="Blue steps" src="https://www.solvermax.com/images/blog/crossword/blue-steps.png" alt="Blue steps" width="300" height="180"></p>
<p>In our <a title="Optimal but not practical - Virtual machine" href="https://www.solvermax.com/blog/optimal-but-not-practical-virtual-machine">previous article</a>, we solved a mixed integer linear program (MILP) model with more than 8 million binary variables. Not long ago, a model of that size would have been unsolvable. Yet, once we had a computer with sufficient memory, the model was solved to optimality by an open source solver in 3 hours.</p>
<p>Of course, not all large models are solvable – even some small models are unsolvable, or at least hard to solve. Nonetheless, modern solvers, in association with modern computers, enable us to solve models that not-so-long-ago were beyond our capabilities.</p>
<p>In our next article, we'll look to compile crosswords using a MILP model. We're not the first to consider using a MILP model to compile crosswords. An article published in 1989 reported attempts to compile small crosswords using MILP models. The article's conclusion was very pessimistic, noting that:</p>
<blockquote><p>...the prospects of using integer programming for any type of puzzle of realistic size and with a substantial lexicon remain bleak.</p><span>Wilson, 1989, <a title="Crossword compilation using integer programming" href="https://academic.oup.com/comjnl/article-pdf/32/3/273/947308/320273.pdf">Crossword compilation using integer programming</a></span></blockquote>
<p>The problems Wilson encountered were insufficient computer memory and the time needed to solve a very small crossword grid, even though he was using a then state-of-the-art million dollar superminicomputer.</p>
<p>But a lot has changed in the 35 years since 1989. Computer hardware is many times faster, and memory capacity has increased enormously. In addition, optimization solver software has improved by orders of magnitude. Models that were difficult to solve in 1989 are now trivial. Solutions that were impossible to find in 1989 may now be within reach.</p>
<p>In this article, we estimate the magnitude of speed improvement for optimization solvers and computer hardware in the 35 years from 1989 to 2024. The results may be surprising.</p>
<h2>1989: Crossword compilation using integer programming</h2>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>As a motivating example, we consider an early attempt to compile crosswords using a mixed integer linear program (MILP). The paper <a title="Crossword compilation using integer programming" href="https://academic.oup.com/comjnl/article-pdf/32/3/273/947308/320273.pdf">Crossword compilation using integer programming</a>, was published in 1989 by J. M. Wilson. That article proposes two MILP model formulations for compiling crosswords:</p>

<img title="Prime 750 superminicomputer" src="https://www.solvermax.com/images/blog/crossword/prime750.jpg" alt="Prime 750 superminicomputer" width="468" height="400">

</figure>
<ul>
<li>Model 1, whole words. Model 1 attempts to fit whole words into a 4x4 fully interlocking puzzle (i.e. no black cells), as shown in Figure 1. With a lexicon of 100 4-letter words, the problem size was 800 variables and 524 constraints. A solution for this 4x4 <a title="double word square" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_square#Double_word_squares">double word square</a> puzzle was found in 1,800 seconds.</li>
<li>Model 2, individual letters. Model 2 attempts to place individual letters into a grid. It is more memory-efficient than Model 1, but it failed to find any solutions within 3,000 seconds, even for very small grids. In any case, Model 2 has a loose formulation that can create "words" that are not in the lexicon, so a solution (if found) may not be valid.</li>
</ul>
<p>From Wilson's experience, we observe that:</p>
<ul>
<li>A key modelling issue was memory usage, especially as the lexicon size increases. The models used a lexicon of 100 words, which is very limiting given that there are several thousand 4-letter English words.</li>
<li>Solutions were difficult to find, even for very small grids.</li>
<li>A model with 800 variables and 524 constraints is now considered to be small. In 1989 it was a large model.</li>
<li>Dense American-style puzzles (like Figure 1) are much harder to solve than sparser British-style crossword puzzles. This is likely because a dense grid has more word intersections. We'll explore this issue further in our next article.</li>
<li>The modelling was performed on a <a title="Prime 750 superminicomputer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Computer">Prime 750 superminicomputer</a>, an example of which is shown in Figure 2. The Prime 750 superminicomputer had up to 8 MB of RAM and it ran at 1 million instructions per second (MIPS). The Prime 750 was a state-of-the-art computer at the time. Depending on configuration, a <a title="THE EXECUTIVE COMPUTER; A Chip With Supercomputer Power" href="https://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/05/business/the-executive-computer-a-chip-with-supercomputer-power.html">system cost several hundred thousand US dollars</a> in the mid to late 1980s. That equates to about US\$1,000,000 today, <a title="U.S. Inflation Calculator" href="https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/">adjusted for inflation</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Wilson's paper refers to <a title="Crossword compilation with Horn clauses" href="https://academic.oup.com/comjnl/article/30/2/183/404335">another paper</a> that uses a lexicon of 1,000 4-letter words to compile crosswords using first-order predicate logic in the Prolog programming language, noting that, "This size of lexicon would present an almost impossible task for an integer programming model."</p>
<p>Overall, Wilson was pessimistic about using integer programming for compiling crosswords, considering it to be impractical, concluding that "the prospects of using integer programming for any type of puzzle of realistic size and with a substantial lexicon remain bleak".</p>
<p>So, integer programming was not a viable method for compiling crossword puzzles in 1989. But a lot has changed since then.</p>
<h2>Computers and solvers have improved enormously</h2>
<p>Wilson's paper was published in 1989. As we write this article in early 2024, that's 35 years ago. Since 1989, computers have become much faster, and they have a lot more memory. In addition, linear programming solvers have improved in both speed and sophistication.</p>
<p>In the following sections we attempt to estimate the magnitude of improvement in the 35 years since 1989.</p>
<h2>Computer improvements</h2>
<h3>Computer speed improvement: 1989-2024</h3>
<p>Computer processing speed has increased enormously over time. According to the <a title="50 years of microprocessor trend data" href="https://github.com/karlrupp/microprocessor-trend-data">50 years of microprocessor trend</a> data shown in Figure 3, single-thread Computer Processing Unit (CPU) performance (using the <a title="SpecINT benchmark" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPECint">SpecINT benchmark</a>) improved from an average score of 67 in 1988-1989 to 105,300 in 2021. That equates to a factor of 1,572 times faster.</p>
<p>From 2021 to 2023, <a title="CPU single thread benchmark scores" href="https://www.cpubenchmark.net/singleThread.html">CPU single thread benchmark scores</a> improved by a further 10%, for a total factor from 1989 to 2023 of 1,729 times faster.</p>

<p>Until 2004, almost all CPUs had a single processing core. Since then, the number of logical CPU cores (i.e., physical cores and/or parallel threads within a physical core) has been increasing. A typical desktop computer now has at least several cores, with many having one or two dozen cores. Some CPUs have hundreds of cores. Graphics card GPUs typically have thousands of cores, though that is a different story.</p>
<p>Many solvers can use multiple CPU cores, to a greater or lesser extent. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><a title="Gurobi" href="https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/current/refman/threads.html">Gurobi</a> and <a title="CPLEX" href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/icos/22.1.1?topic=parameters-parallel-mode-switch">CPLEX</a> use multiple cores, by default, when solving models.</li>
<li>The <a title="Octeract" href="https://octeract.gg/octeract-engine/">Octeract solver engine</a> relies on parallel processing for its high performance in solving non-linear models.</li>
<li>The open-source <a title="HiGHS" href="https://ergo-code.github.io/HiGHS/dev/parallel/#Future-plans">HiGHS</a> solver has "limited opportunities for exploiting parallel computing", though greater use of multiple CPU cores is planned soon.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, the speed improvement for multiple cores compared with a single core, according to <a title="Amdahl's law" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl%27s_law">Amdahl's law</a>, is generally much less than a linear multiple of the number of cores.</p>
<p>For this analysis, we make the sweeping assumption that using multiple CPUs somewhat more than doubles the performance of a single CPU. That is, we estimate that total computer processing speed increased by a factor of about 4,000 times (= 2.3 x 1,729) from 1989 to 2024.</p>
<h3>Computers have a lot more memory</h3>
<p>The Prime 750 superminicomputer used by Wilson could have up to 8 MB of RAM (though some installations had only 2 or 4 MB of RAM). A modern desktop PC may have 8 GB of RAM – i.e., 1,024 times as much memory.</p>
<p>Though 8 GB of RAM is quite small for a computer in 2024. For example, the virtual machine we used in <a title="Optimal but not practical - Virtual machine" href="https://www.solvermax.com/blog/optimal-but-not-practical-virtual-machine">our previous article</a> has 128 GB of RAM – that's 16,384 times the maximum memory available in a million dollar computer in 1989.</p>
<p>Computer memory in 2024 is also many times faster than it was in 1989. We assume that the memory speed does not materially change our estimate of CPU speed increase.</p>
<h3>Computer costs has plummeted</h3>
<p>In this analysis, we're comparing a 1989 superminicomputer with a 2024 desktop PC – because those are the machines that would typically be used for optimization modelling in their respective eras. But this is not an entirely fair comparison, as the superminicomputer cost a million dollars (in today's money), while a high specification desktop computer now costs only a few thousand dollars – a reduction of more than 99%. If we maintained cost parity, then the performance of a 2024 computer would be even greater.</p>
<h3>Summary of computer hardware improvements</h3>
<p>Compared with 35 years ago, computers are thousands of times faster, with thousands of times more memory, and their cost has fallen by more than 99%.</p>
<h2>Solver improvements</h2>
<h3>Our estimate is based on aggregating separate estimates for periods of time</h3>
<p>The best estimate we can find of how much optimization solvers have improved is published by Gurobi. We start with an analysis by Gurobi estimating the <a title="Computation progress in linear and mixed integer programming" href="https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/read/54431495/computational-progress-in-linear-and-mixed-integer-programming">computation progress in linear and mixed integer programming</a> from 1991 to 2008. We then look at an updated analysis to 2020, which we extend to 2023.</p>
<h3>CPLEX performance improvement: 1991 to 2008</h3>
<figure>
<figcaption>Figure 4. CPLEX speed improvement for MILP from 1991 to 2008</figcaption>
<img title="CPLEX speed improvement" src="https://www.solvermax.com/images/blog/crossword/cplex-speedup.png" alt="CPLEX speed improvement" width="664" height="359">
</figure>
<p>Figure 4 shows Gurobi's assessment of speed improvement for the CPLEX solver when solving MILP models, for each major software version (bars) and cumulative (line), from 1991 to 2008.</p>
<p>The total cumulative speed improvement is a factor of almost 30,000 times faster (note the log scale for the right-hand axis).</p>
<p>Over those 17 years, this equates to about 1.8 times faster per annum, on average. Though improvements don't occur at a steady rate, with especially large improvements occurring in CPLEX versions 2.1-3.0 (inclusion of the dual simplex method) and in CPLEX versions 6.0-6.5 (many improvements gleaned from "mining" the academic literature).</p>
<p>Importantly, this estimate is just the improvement in solver software performance, not allowing for the speed increase of computer hardware over the same period.</p>
<p>Note that we ignore any improvement in solver performance from 1989 to 1991, as we don't have that information. But if the same rate of improvement (1.8 times per annum) had occurred in those 3 years, then we would have another factor of almost 6 times faster.</p>
<h3>Gurobi performance improvement: 2009 to 2023</h3>
<p>Dr. Bixby, one of the founders of Gurobi, presented an <a title="Optimization: Past, Present, Future with Dr. Robert Bixby" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R8-nt5NyiE">updated analysis</a> of solver performance improvement in 2021, as shown in Figure 5.</p>
<figure>
<figcaption>Figure 5. Gurobi speed improvement for MILP from 2009 to 2020</figcaption>
<img title="Gurobi speed improvement" src="https://www.solvermax.com/images/blog/crossword/bixby-2021.png" alt="Gurobi speed improvement" width="639" height="348">
</figure>
<p>The figure states a cumulative improvement factor of 3,730,625 times, from CPLEX 1.2 to Gurobi 9.1 (released in 2020). Given the CPLEX improvement factor of 29,530 above, this implies an additional improvement for Gurobi of 126 times for the period 2009 to 2020.</p>
<p>Subsequent versions of Gurobi claim performance improvements for MILP models of:</p>
<ul>
<li><a title="Version 9.1 to 9.5" href="https://www.gurobi.com/wp-content/uploads/9.5-launch-Presentation.pdf">Version 9.1 to 9.5 (2021)</a>: 15%</li>
<li><a title="Version 9.5 to 10.0" href="https://www.gurobi.com/whats-new-gurobi-10-0/">Version 9.5 to 10.0 (2022)</a>: 13%</li>
<li><a title="Version 10.0 to 11.0" href="https://www.gurobi.com/whats-new-gurobi-11-0/">Version 10.0 to 11.0 (2023)</a>: 8.6%</li>
</ul>
<p>Combining these changes, we estimate that from 2009 to 2023 the Gurobi solver's speed improved by a factor of about 178 times.</p>
<p>A factor of 178 over 14 years equates to an average rate of about 1.45 times per annum. This is lower than the 1.8 times annual average rate from 1991 to 2009, but it is still impressive nonetheless.</p>
<h3>Solver performance improvement: 1989 to 2024</h3>
<p>Overall, by combining each of the solver-related steps above, we can estimate the cumulative improvement in solver performance over the last 35 years.</p>
<p>The result is that MILP solver performance improved by a factor of 5 million times (in round numbers) from 1989 to 2024. This is conservative estimate, as we exclude any improvement that may have occurred from 1989 to 1991, and from 2023 to 2024.</p>
<p>This improvement, assuming the same computer hardware, is equivalent to a model that takes 60 seconds to solve in 2023 taking 10 years to solve if started in 1989. That is, if it was possible to solve at all in 1989.</p>
<p>Note that our solver performance increase estimate is based on the commercial solvers CPLEX and Gurobi. An open-source solver, like HiGHS, is generally not as fast as CPLEX or Gurobi – perhaps by an order of magnitude, more-or-less, depending on the model. Though that hardly seems significant, given the magnitude of speed improvements over the past three+ decades.</p>
<h2>Solver + computer performance improvement: 1989 to 2024</h2>
<figure>
<figcaption>20 billion times faster</figcaption>
<p>Solving MILP models is about 20 billion times faster than it was 35 years ago.</p>
</figure>
<h3>Combined result</h3>
<p>Combining the computer hardware speed increase of 4,000 times with the solver software performance improvement of 5 million times, the total improvement from 1989 to 2024 is a factor of 20 billion times faster!</p>
<p>At that rate, a model that takes 60 seconds to solve in 2023 would have taken 38,000 years to solve if started in 1989.</p>
<h3>A grain of salt</h3>
<p>Of course, we shouldn't take these estimates too literally.</p>
<p>Firstly, there's substantial room for variation in our estimates. Some numbers are uncertain, while others are simply guesses. Also, aggregating the various factors in a multiplicative manner may not be entirely valid.</p>
<p>Secondly, there are many elements that contribute to how fast, or even whether, a MILP model can be solved, in addition to computer and solver raw speed. Other elements include memory size, programming language features, the fit between solver methodology and a model's specific characteristics, and changes in solver features.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the magnitude of speed increases we've described in this article surely help in solving larger, more difficult MILP models. A lot.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In this article, we estimate the speed improvement in computer hardware and optimization solver software since 1989. This assessment is motivated by an academic paper by Wilson, published 35 years ago, describing an attempt to compile crossword puzzles using mixed integer linear programming (MILP). That attempt was largely unsuccessful, as the task was beyond the capability of MILP solvers at that time.</p>
<p>But both computers and MILP solvers have advanced enormously since 1989 – by a combined factor of around 20 billion time faster! That improvement should be enough to offset at least some of Wilson's pessimism about being able to compile crossword puzzles using MILP models. Likewise for many other optimization models.</p>
<p>In the next article, we attempt to formulate and solve a MILP to compile crossword puzzles. This is still a difficult problem, though given the improvement in computer and solver speed, there is some basis for optimism that the task is now possible.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <p>Happy New Year, hackers! I started the new year 2024 with a personal milestone of mine.
<a href="https://kde.org/plasma-desktop/" target="_blank">
    The KDE Plasma 5.27</a> is available on OpenBSD -current and will be part of the next release 7.5.
I’m sure not very many people would understand how large this work. It started
so many years ago that I don’t even know how long I’ve been working on it.
Definitely years and not just 1 or 2. I remember that before I joined the OpenBSD community,
Vadim Zhukov did a lot of work in the Qt/KDE area. In the early days, it was
good to have someone to talk to, or just to know “you’re not alone”. This has
not been the case for a long time.  I’ve been doing it alone for years, just
like Vadim did it alone for years. It’s probably the burden of the project, we
are a super small team of OpenBSD kernel and ports developers.</p>
<p>It should be mentioned that last year kn@ - Klemens Nanni helped with a lot of
reviews and thus made it possible that we have KDE as packages.</p>
<p>I’m beginning to wonder as I write. What happens now? What happen next? Do I
have plans? Sure I could just continue to maintain the whole thing.
What will definitely be interesting is the KDE switch from Qt5 to Qt6. This
should not be a big challenge for OpenBSD. All dependencies like all Qt6
modules are ported. So this will just be a task of hard work.</p>
<p>Here are some thoughts on what we could work on.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/openbsd/ports/blob/master/meta/kde/pkg/README-plasma#L91" target="_blank">
    Fix KWin compositor</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/openbsd/ports/blob/master/meta/kde/pkg/README-plasma#L68" target="_blank">
    KDE Wayland</a></li>
<li><a href="https://networkmanager.dev/docs/libnm/latest/" target="_blank">
    NetworkManager</a> (It’s based on glib and GObject. I don’t like it)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/sddm/sddm" target="_blank">
    SDDM - QML based X11 and Wayland display manager </a> - Does that really still make sense?</li>
<li><a href="https://apps.kde.org/discover/" target="_blank">
    Discover</a> support for pkg_add(1)</li>
</ul>
<p>Perhaps it is normal that after such a big achievement, a period of reflection
begins. Let us be surprised what 2024 will bring.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><section><main><p>I've always found distributed systems to be the most fascinating branch of
computer science. I think the reason is that distributed systems are subject to
the rules of the physical world just like we are. Things are never perfect, you
cannot get everything you want, you’re always limited by physics, and often by
economics, or by who you can communicate with. Many problems in distributed
systems simply do not have a clean solution, instead there are different
trade-offs you can make.</p>
<p>While at Citus Data, Microsoft, and now Crunchy Data, the focus of my work has
been on distributed PostgreSQL architectures. At the last
<a href="http://pgconf.eu/">PGConf.EU</a> in December, I gave a talk titled
“<a href="https://www.postgresql.eu/events/pgconfeu2023/sessions/session/4826-postgresql-distributed-architectures-best-practices/">PostgreSQL Distributed: Architectures &amp; Best Practices</a>”
where I went over various kinds of distributed PostgreSQL architectures that
I’ve encountered over the years.</p>
<p>Many distributed database discussions focus on algorithms for distributed query
planning, transactions, etc. These are very interesting topics, but the truth is
that only a small part of my time as a distributed database engineer goes into
algorithms, and an excessive amount of time goes into making very careful
trade-offs at every level (and of course, failure handling, testing, fixing
bugs). Similarly, what many users notice within the first few minutes of using a
distributed database is how unexpectedly slow they can be, because you quickly
start hitting performance trade-offs.</p>
<p>There are many types of distributed PostgreSQL architectures, and they each make
a different set of trade-offs. Let’s go over some of these architectures.</p>
<h2 id="single-machine-postgresql"><a href="#single-machine-postgresql">Single machine PostgreSQL</a></h2>
<p>To set the stage for discussing distributed PostgreSQL architectures, we first
need to understand a bit about the simplest possible architecture: running
PostgreSQL on a single machine, or "node".</p>
<p>PostgreSQL on a single machine can be incredibly fast. There’s virtually no
network latency on the database layer and you can even co-locate your
application server. Millions of IOPS are available depending on the machine
configuration. Disk latency is measured in microseconds. In general, running
PostgreSQL on a single machine is a performant and cost-efficient choice.</p>
<p>So why doesn’t everyone just use a single machine?</p>
<p>Many companies do. However, PostgreSQL on a single machine comes with
operational hazards. If the machine fails, there’s inevitably some kind of
downtime. If the disk fails, you’re likely facing some data loss. An overloaded
system can be difficult to scale. And you’re limited to the storage size of a
disk, which when full will cease to process and store data. That very low
latency and efficiency clearly comes at a price.</p>
<p>Distributed PostgreSQL architectures are ultimately trying to address the
operational hazards of a single machine in different ways. In doing so, they do
lose some of its efficiency, and especially the low latency.</p>
<h2 id="goals-of-a-distributed-database-architecture"><a href="#goals-of-a-distributed-database-architecture">Goals of a Distributed Database Architecture</a></h2>
<p>The goal of a distributed database architecture is to try to meet the
availability, durability, performance, regulatory, and scale requirements of
large organizations, subject the physics. The ultimate goal is to do so with the
same rich functionality and precise transactional semantics as a single node
RDBMS.</p>
<p>There are several mechanisms that distributed database systems employ to achieve
this, namely:</p>
<ul>
<li>Replication - Place copies of data on different machines</li>
<li>Distribution - Place partitions of data on different machines</li>
<li>Decentralization - Place different DBMS activities on different machines</li>
</ul>
<p>In practice, each of these mechanisms inherently comes with concessions in terms
of performance, transactional semantics, functionality, and/or operational
complexity.</p>
<p>To get a nice thing, you’ll have to give up a nice thing, but there are many
different combinations of what you can get and what you need to give up.</p>
<h2 id="the-importance-of-latency-in-oltp-systems"><a href="#the-importance-of-latency-in-oltp-systems">The importance of latency in OLTP systems</a></h2>
<p>Of course, distributed systems have already taken over the world, and most of
the time we don’t really need to worry a lot about trade-offs when using them.
Why would distributed <em>database</em> systems be any different?</p>
<p>The difference lies in a combination of storing the authoritative state for the
application, the rich functionality that an RDBMS like PostgreSQL offers, and
the relatively high impact of latency on client-perceived performance in OLTP
systems.</p>
<p>PostgreSQL, like most other RDBMSs, uses a synchronous, interactive protocol
where transactions are performed step-by-step. The client waits for the database
to answer before sending the next command, and the next command might depend on
the answer to the previous.</p>
<p>Any network latency between client and database server will already be a
noticeable factor in the overall duration of a transaction. When PostgreSQL
itself is a distributed system that makes internal network round trips (e.g.
while waiting for WAL commit), the duration can get many times higher.</p>
<p><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/lPM0ntuwQfh8VQgJRu0mFg/41566cae-dec8-4d8d-9b32-a8c23cb70200/public" alt="latency diagram" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>Why is it bad for transactions to take longer? Surely humans won’t notice if
they need to wait 10-20ms? Well, if transactions take on average 20ms, then a
single (interactive) session can only do 50 transactions per second. You then
need a lot of concurrent sessions to actually achieve high throughput.</p>
<p>Having many sessions is not always practical from the application point-of-view,
and each session uses significant resources like memory on the database server.
Most PostgreSQL set ups limit the maximum number of sessions in the hundreds or
low thousands, which puts a hard limit on achievable transaction throughput when
network latency is involved. In addition, any operation that is holding locks
while waiting for network round trips is also going to affect the achievable
concurrency.</p>
<p><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/lPM0ntuwQfh8VQgJRu0mFg/f094a883-daa1-4a52-caa5-5590bce9fe00/public" alt="connections and processes diagram" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>While in theory, latency does not have to affect performance so much, in
practice it almost always does. The CIDR ‘23 paper
<a href="https://www.cidrdb.org/cidr2023/papers/p50-ziegler.pdf">“Is Scalable OLTP in the Cloud a solved problem?”</a>
gives a nice discussion of the issue of latency in section 2.5.</p>
<h2 id="postgresql-distributed-architectures"><a href="#postgresql-distributed-architectures">PostgreSQL Distributed Architectures</a></h2>
<p>PostgreSQL can be distributed at many different layers that hook into different
parts of its own architecture and make different trade-offs. In the following
sections, we will discuss these well-known architectures:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Network-attached block storage</strong> (e.g. EBS)</li>

</ul>
<p>We will describe the pros and cons of each architecture, relative to running
PostgreSQL on a single machine.</p>
<p>Note that many of these architectures are orthogonal. For instance, you could
have a sharded system with read replicas using network-attached storage, or an
active-active system that uses DBMS-optimized cloud storage.</p>
<h3 id="network-attached-block-storage"><a href="#network-attached-block-storage">Network-attached block storage</a></h3>
<p>Network-attached block storage is a common technique in cloud-based
architectures where the database files are stored on a different device. The
database server typically runs in a virtual machine in a Hypervisor, which
exposes a block device to the VM. Any reads and writes to the block device will
result in network calls to a block storage API. The block storage service
internally replicates the writes to 2-3 storage nodes.</p>
<p><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/lPM0ntuwQfh8VQgJRu0mFg/4cd769ee-098e-4f1e-072c-1b15dcfcb500/public" alt="Network-attached block storage architecture in the cloud" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>Practically all managed PostgreSQL services use network-attached block devices
because the benefits are critical to most organizations. The internal
replication results in high durability and also allows the block storage service
to remain available when a storage node fails. The data is stored separately
from the database server, which means the database server can easily be
respawned on a different machine in case of failure, or when scaling up/down.
Finally, the disk itself is easily resizable and supports snapshots for fast
backups and creating replicas.</p>
<p>Getting so many nice things does come at a significant performance cost. Where
modern Nvme drives generally achieve over &gt;1M IOPS and disk latency in the tens
of microseconds, network-attached storage is often below 10K IOPS and &gt;1ms disk
latency, especially for writes. That is a ~2 order of magnitude difference.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Higher durability (replication)</li>
<li>Higher uptime (replace VM, reattach)</li>
<li>Fast backups and replica creation (snapshots)</li>
<li>Disk is resizable</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Higher disk latency (~20μs -&gt; ~1000μs)</li>
<li>Lower IOPS (~1M -&gt; ~10k IOPS)</li>
<li>Crash recovery on restart takes time</li>
<li>Cost can be high</li>
</ul>
<p>💡 <strong>Guideline</strong>: the durability and availability benefits of network-attached
storage usually outweigh the performance downsides, but it’s worth keeping in
mind that PostgreSQL can be much faster.</p>
<h3 id="read-replicas"><a href="#read-replicas">Read replicas</a></h3>
<p>PostgreSQL has built-in support for physical replication to read-only replicas.
The most common way of using a replica is to set it up as a hot standby that
takes over when the primary fails in a
<a href="https://www.crunchydata.com/blog/database-terminology-explained-postgres-high-availability-and-disaster-recovery">high availability set up</a>.
There are many blogs, books, and talks describing the trade-offs of high
availability set ups, so in this post I will focus on other architectures.</p>
<p>Another common use for read replicas is to help you scale read throughput when
reads are CPU or I/O bottlenecked by load balancing queries across replicas,
which achieves linear scalability of reads and also offloads the primary, which
speeds up writes!</p>
<p><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/lPM0ntuwQfh8VQgJRu0mFg/67558330-e428-41c2-a876-3d6fe88ba000/public" alt="read replica diagram" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>A challenge with read replicas is that there is no prescribed way of using them.
You have to decide on the topology and how you query them, and in doing so you
will be making distributed systems trade-offs yourself.</p>
<p>The primary usually does not wait for replication when committing a write, which
means read replicas are always slightly behind. That can become an issue when
your application does a read that, from the user’s perspective, depends on a
write that happened earlier. For example, a user clicks “Add to cart”, which
adds the item to the shopping cart and immediately sends the user to the
shopping cart page. If reading the shopping cart contents happens on the read
replica, the shopping cart might then appear empty. Hence, you need to be very
careful about which reads use a read replica.</p>
<p><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/lPM0ntuwQfh8VQgJRu0mFg/646e4756-c11e-49e8-c4b3-b6b139e32900/public" alt="digram of inserts lagging behind a read replica" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>Even if reads do not directly depend on a preceding write, at least from the
client perspective, there may still be strange time travel anomalies. When load
balancing between different nodes, clients might repeatedly get connected to
different replica and see a different state of the database. As distributed
systems engineers, we say that there is no “monotonic read consistency”.</p>
<p>Another issue with read replicas is that, when queries are load balanced
randomly, they will each have similar cache contents. While that is great when
there are certain extremely hot queries, it becomes painful when the frequently
read data (working set) no longer fits in memory and each read replica will be
performing a lot of redundant I/O. In contrast, a sharded architecture would
divide the data over the memory and avoid I/O.</p>
<p>Read replicas are a powerful tool for scaling reads, but you should consider
whether your workload is really appropriate for it.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Read throughput scales linearly</li>
<li>Low latency stale reads if read replica is closer than primary</li>
<li>Lower load on primary</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Eventual read-your-writes consistency</li>
<li>No monotonic read consistency</li>
<li>Poor cache usage</li>
</ul>
<p>💡 <strong>Guideline:</strong> Consider using read replicas when you need &gt;100k reads/sec or
observe a CPU bottleneck due to reads, best avoided for dependent transactions
and large working sets.</p>
<h3 id="dbms-optimized-cloud-storage"><a href="#dbms-optimized-cloud-storage">DBMS-optimized cloud storage</a></h3>
<p>There are a number of cloud services now like Aurora and AlloyDB that provide a
network-attached storage layer that is optimized specifically for a DBMS.</p>
<p>In particular, a DBMS normally performs every write in two different ways:
Immediately to the write-ahead log (WAL), and in the background to a data page
(or several pages, when indexes are involved). Normally, PostgreSQL performs
both of these writes, but in the DBMS-optimized storage architecture the
background pages writes are performed by the storage layer instead, based on the
incoming WAL. This reduces the amount of write I/O on the primary node.</p>
<p><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/lPM0ntuwQfh8VQgJRu0mFg/8f4c2648-db97-40f8-1581-7d4a6ce0fa00/public" alt="diagram of dbms-optmized storage" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>The WAL is typically replicated directly from the primary node to several
availability zones to parallelize the network round trips, which increases I/O
again. Always writing to multiple availability zones also increases the write
latency, which can result in lower per-session performance. In addition, read
latency can be higher because the storage layer does not always materialize
pages in memory. Architecturally, PostgreSQL is also not optimized for these
storage characteristics.</p>
<p>While the theory behind DBMS-optimized storage is sound. In practice, the
performance benefits are often not very pronounced (and can be negative), and
the cost can be much higher than regular network-attached block storage. It does
offer a greater degree of flexibility to the cloud service provider, for
instance in terms of attach/detach times, because storage is controlled in the
data plane rather than the hypervisor.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Potential performance benefits by avoiding page writes from primary</li>
<li>Replicas can reuse storage, incl. hot standby</li>
<li>Can do faster reattach, branching than network-attached storage</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Write latency is high by default</li>
<li>High cost / pricing</li>
<li>PostgreSQL is not designed for it, not OSS</li>
</ul>
<p>💡 <strong>Guideline:</strong> Can be beneficial for complex workloads, but important to
measure whether price-performance under load is actually better than using a
bigger machine.</p>
<h3 id="active-active"><a href="#active-active">Active-active</a></h3>
<p>In the active-active architecture any node can locally accept writes without
coordination with other nodes. It is typically used with replicas in multiple
sites, each of which will then see low read and write latency, and can survive
failure of other sites. These benefits are phenomenal, but of course come with a
significant downside.</p>
<p>First, you have the typical eventual consistency downsides of read replicas.
However, the main challenge with an active-active setup is that update conflicts
are not resolved upfront. Normally, if two concurrent transactions try to update
the same row in PostgreSQL, the first one will take a “row-level lock”. In case
of active-active, both updates might be accepted concurrently.</p>
<p>For instance, when you perform two simultaneous updates of a counter on
different nodes, the nodes might both see 4 as the current value and set the new
value to 5. When replication happens, they’ll happily agree that the new value
is 5 even though there were two increment operations.</p>
<p><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/lPM0ntuwQfh8VQgJRu0mFg/627e299d-d26a-439d-cfe4-83049c73b200/public" alt="diagram of an active-active architecture" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>Active-active systems do not have a linear history, even at the row level, which
makes them very hard to program against. However, if you are very prepared to
live with that, the benefits could be attractive especially for very high
availability.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Very high read and write availability</li>
<li>Low read and write latency</li>
<li>Read throughput scales linearly</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Eventual read-your-writes consistency</li>
<li>No monotonic read consistency</li>
<li>No linear history (updates might conflict after commit)</li>
</ul>
<p>💡 <strong>General guideline:</strong> Consider only for very simple workloads (e.g. queues)
and only if you really need the benefits.</p>
<h3 id="transparent-sharding"><a href="#transparent-sharding">Transparent sharding</a></h3>
<p>Transparent sharding systems like Citus distribute tables by a shard key and/or
replicate tables across multiple primary nodes. Each node shows the distributed
tables as if they were regular PostgreSQL tables and queries &amp; transactions are
transparently routed or parallelized across nodes.</p>
<p>Data is stored in shards, which are regular PostgreSQL tables, which can take
advantage of indexes, constraints, etc. In addition, the shards can be
co-located by the shard key (in “shard groups”), such that joins and foreign
keys that include the shard key can be performed locally.</p>
<p><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/lPM0ntuwQfh8VQgJRu0mFg/1cb5e4db-c901-40e3-5327-73a5c6caa500/public" alt="transparent sharding diagram" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>The advantage of distributing the data this way is that you can take advantage
of the memory, IO bandwidth, storage, and CPU of all the nodes in an efficient
manner. You could even ensure that your data or at least your working set always
fits in memory by scaling out.</p>
<p>Scaling out transactional workloads is most effective when queries have a filter
on the shard key, such that they can be routed to a single shard group (e.g.
single tenant in a
<a href="https://www.crunchydata.com/blog/designing-your-postgres-database-for-multi-tenancy">multi-tenant app</a>).
That way, there is only a marginal amount of overhead compared to running a
query on a single server, but you have a lot more capacity. Another effective
way of scaling out is when you have compute-heavy analytical queries that can be
parallelized across the shards (e.g.
<a href="https://www.crunchydata.com/blog/postgres-citus-partman-your-iot-database">time series / IoT</a>).</p>
<p>However, there is also higher latency, which reduces the per-session throughput
compared to a single machine. And, if you have a simple lookup that does not
have a shard key filter, you will still experience all the overhead of
parallelizing the query across nodes. Finally, there may be restrictions in
terms of data model (e.g. unique and foreign constraints must include shard
key), SQL (non-co-located correlated subqueries), and transactional guarantees
(snapshot isolation only at shard level).</p>
<p>Using a sharded system often means that you will need to adjust your application
to deal with higher latency and a more rigid data model. For instance, if you
are building a
<a href="https://docs.citusdata.com/en/stable/get_started/tutorial_multi_tenant.html">multi-tenant application</a>
you will need to add tenant ID columns to all your tables to use as a shard key,
and if you are currently loading data using INSERT statements then you might
want to switch to COPY to avoid waiting for every row.</p>
<p>If you are willing to adjust your application, sharding can be one of the most
powerful tools in your arsenal for dealing with data-intensive applications.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Scale throughput for reads &amp; writes (CPU &amp; IOPS)</li>
<li>Scale memory for large working sets</li>
<li>Parallelize analytical queries, batch operations</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>High read and write latency</li>
<li>Data model decisions have high impact on performance</li>
<li>Snapshot isolation concessions</li>
</ul>
<p>💡 <strong>General guideline:</strong> Use for multi-tenant apps, otherwise use for large
working set (&gt;100GB) or compute heavy queries.</p>
<h3 id="distributed-key-value-storage-with-sql"><a href="#distributed-key-value-storage-with-sql">Distributed key-value storage with SQL</a></h3>
<p>About a decade ago, Google Spanner introduced the notion of a distributed
key-value store that supports transactions across nodes (key ranges) with
snapshot isolation in a scalable manner by using globally synchronized clocks.
Subsequent evolutions of Spanner then added a SQL layer on top, and ultimately
even a PostgreSQL interface. Open source alternatives like CockroachDB and
Yugabyte followed a similar approach without the requirement of synchronized
clocks, at the cost of significantly higher latency.</p>
<p>These systems have built on top of existing key-value storage techniques for
availability and scalability, such as shard-level replication and failover using
Paxos or Raft. Tables are then stored in the key-value store, with the key being
a combination of the table ID and the primary key. The SQL engine is adjusted
accordingly, distributing queries where possible.</p>
<p><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/lPM0ntuwQfh8VQgJRu0mFg/de7bc03c-8f80-4384-383a-0d38dde0d800/public" alt="key value store diagram" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>In my view, the relational data model (or, your typical PostgreSQL app) is not
well-served by using a distributed key-value store underneath. Related tables
and indexes are not necessarily stored together, meaning typical operations such
as joins and evaluating foreign keys or even simple index lookups might incur an
excessive number of internal network hops. The relatively strong transactional
guarantees that involve additional locks and coordination can also become a drag
on performance.</p>
<p>In comparison to PostgreSQL or Citus, performance and efficiency are often
<a href="https://gigaom.com/report/transaction-processing-price-performance-testing/">disappointing</a>.
However, these systems offer much richer (PostgreSQL-like) functionality than
existing key-value stores, and better scalability than consensus stores like
etcd, so they can be a great alternative for those.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Good read and write availability (shard-level failover)</li>
<li>Single table, single key operations scale well</li>
<li>No additional data modeling steps or snapshot isolation concessions</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Many internal operations incur high latency</li>
<li>No local joins in current implementations</li>
<li>Not actually PostgreSQL, and less mature and optimized</li>
</ul>
<p>💡 <strong>General guideline:</strong> Just use PostgreSQL 😉 For simple applications, the
availability and scalability benefits can be useful.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></h2>
<p>PostgreSQL can be distributed at different layers. Each architecture can
introduce severe trade-offs. Almost nothing comes for free.</p>
<p>When deciding on the database architecture, keep asking yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li>What do I really want?</li>
<li>Which architecture achieves that?</li>
<li>What are the downsides?</li>
<li>What can my application tolerate? (can I change my application?)</li>
</ul>
<p>Even with state-of-the-art tools, deploying a distributed database system is
never a solved problem, and perhaps never will be. You will need to spend some
time understanding the trade-offs. I hope this blog post will help.</p>

    </div><p>The yellowfin tuna commonly enjoyed in sashimi, poke bowls and salad sandwiches may soon disappear from these dishes if current over-exploitation rates remain unchanged, especially in the Indian Ocean.</p>


										      
																																	<p>A <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2023.106902">paper</a>, titled "Multiple lines of evidence highlight the dire straits of yellowfin <a href="https://phys.org/tags/tuna/" rel="tag">tuna</a> in the Indian Ocean," and published in <i>Ocean and Coastal Management</i> shows that since industrial exploitation started in 1950, the global biomass—the weight of a given <a href="https://phys.org/tags/population/" rel="tag">population</a> in the water—of yellowfin tuna has decreased, on average, by 54% across the four populations managed by tuna Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (RFMO). In the Indian Ocean, yellowfin tuna biomass has experienced a 70% decline in the past 70 years.</p>
<p>"If we look at more recent years, we can see that global yellowfin tuna populations continue to struggle. Biomass continues to decline everywhere except for stabilizing trends in the Western Pacific Ocean, prompted by management interventions," said Kristina Heidrich, lead author of the study and Ph.D. candidate with the Sea Around Us—Indian Ocean at the University of Western Australia (UWA).</p>
<p>"In most places, extractions have regularly surpassed the maximum sustainable yield or MSY limit, which is the level that would allow for the highest possible catches to be sustained over time, given that <a href="https://phys.org/tags/environmental+conditions/" rel="tag">environmental conditions</a> don't change much," added Dirk Zeller, co-author of the study and director of the Sea Around Us—Indian Ocean.</p>

																																						
																																			<p>To strengthen their evaluations, Heidrich and her co-authors used multiple methodologies. Since yellowfin tuna is normally assessed by RFMOs, they used the organizations' time series and assessment results of yellowfin tuna biomass to estimate its annual fluctuations from 1950 to 2020.</p>
<p>In parallel, they applied the CMSY++ approach, which relies mainly on time series of fisheries catches to assess the status of fish stocks. Finally, they analyzed 955 records of yellowfin tuna obtained from fisheries-independent sampling with Baited Remote Underwater Video Systems (BRUVS), which record biological and <a href="https://phys.org/tags/ecological+data/" rel="tag">ecological data</a> such as a species' size, biomass and how abundant it is in an area.</p>
<p>"The data collected with BRUVS provided a more holistic and fisheries-independent picture of the pelagic community and the status of the populations, which can complement fisheries-dependent data and analyses," said Jessica Meeuwig, co-author of the paper and director of UWA's Marine Futures Lab.</p>
<p>"These fisheries-independent BRUVS data suggest that, since 2014, yellowfin tuna in the Indian Ocean are the least common, least abundant, have the lowest biomass, and are the smallest yellowfin tuna in the existing dataset."</p>
<p>The CMSY++ approach, on the other hand, showed that even though yellowfin tuna exploitation rates slightly exceeded the MSY limit in the past decade in the eastern and western Pacific Ocean and in the Atlantic Ocean, these populations are not currently undergoing overfishing. That's not the case for the Indian Ocean, where overfishing is ongoing.</p>

																																			<p>"Beyond yellowfin tuna fisheries contributing more than US$16 billion to the <a href="https://phys.org/tags/global+economy/" rel="tag">global economy</a> yearly, the species is an <a href="https://phys.org/tags/apex+predator/" rel="tag">apex predator</a> that plays a critical role in the functioning, productivity and overall health of marine ecosystems," said Daniel Pauly, co-author of the study and principal investigator of the Sea Around Us initiative at the University of British Columbia.</p>
<p>"The risk of population collapse is high if current management does not adapt. Stringent management constraints must be implemented to reduce overall fishing capacity, rebuild overfished populations, and reduce the <a href="https://phys.org/tags/collateral+damage/" rel="tag">collateral damage</a> these fisheries cause to other species such as sharks."</p>
<p>The researchers note that, by using multiple lines of evidence that cross-validate each other, such as the ones they employed, management organizations can improve the confidence, transparency and accuracy of the information that guides their decisions. They also propose stricter management measures such as a reduction of fishing capacity, ensuring that the MSY limit is observed and implementing effective catch limits.</p>
<p>"In the Indian Ocean in particular, a catch reduction of 30% from 2020 levels is urgent to halt and reverse the decline in <a href="https://phys.org/tags/yellowfin+tuna/" rel="tag">yellowfin tuna</a> population," Heidrich said.</p>

                 <div><strong><span>CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA</span></strong>&nbsp;Apple today announced Apple Vision Pro will be available beginning Friday, February 2, at all U.S. Apple Store locations and the U.S. Apple Store online. Vision Pro is a revolutionary spatial computer that transforms how people work, collaborate, connect, relive memories, and enjoy entertainment. Vision Pro seamlessly blends digital content with the physical world and unlocks powerful spatial experiences in visionOS, controlled by the most natural and intuitive inputs possible — a user’s eyes, hands, and voice. An all-new App Store provides users with access to more than 1 million compatible apps across iOS and iPadOS, as well as new experiences that take advantage of the unique capabilities of Vision Pro. Pre-orders for Apple Vision Pro begin Friday, January 19, at 5 a.m. PST.

                 <h2><strong>A Revolutionary Operating System and User Interface</strong>
</h2>
                 
             
                 <div>Apple Vision Pro is powered by visionOS, which is built on the foundation of decades of engineering innovation in macOS, iOS, and iPadOS. visionOS delivers powerful spatial experiences, unlocking new opportunities at work and at home. Featuring a brand-new three-dimensional user interface and input system controlled entirely by a user’s eyes, hands, and voice, navigation feels magical. Intuitive gestures allow users to interact with apps by simply looking at them, tapping their fingers to select, flicking their wrist to scroll, or using a virtual keyboard or dictation to type. With Siri, users can quickly open or close apps, play media, and more.

                 <div>Apple Vision Pro is designed as a modular system so users can personalize their fit. A singular piece of three-dimensionally formed, laminated glass gently curves around the user’s face and flows into the custom aluminum alloy frame. The Light Seal is made of a soft textile and comes in a range of shapes and sizes, flexing to conform to a user’s face for a precise fit. Flexible straps ensure audio remains close to the user’s ears, while the included Solo Knit Band and Dual Loop Band allow users to find the optimal fit for them. For those with vision correction needs, ZEISS Optical Inserts are available with a prescription or as readers that magnetically attach to Vision Pro, allowing users to take full advantage of the display’s incredible sharpness and clarity.<sup>2</sup>

                 <div>Apple Vision Pro also features a high-performance eye tracking system that uses high-speed cameras and a ring of LEDs that project invisible light patterns onto the user’s eyes for responsive, intuitive input. And to help the user stay connected to the people around them, Apple designed a groundbreaking new feature called EyeSight. When a person approaches someone wearing Vision Pro, the device looks transparent — letting the user see them while also displaying the user’s eyes. When a user is immersed in an Environment or using an app, EyeSight gives visual cues to others about what the user is focused on.

                 <div>The breakthrough display, advanced audio experiences, high-performance eye tracking system, and more are powered by Apple silicon in a unique dual-chip design. The M2 chip delivers powerful standalone performance, while the brand-new R1 chip processes input from 12 cameras, five sensors, and six microphones to ensure that content feels like it is appearing right in front of the user’s eyes.

                 <div>Apple Vision Pro offers industry-leading privacy and security. Optic ID is a new authentication system that analyzes a user’s iris to unlock Vision Pro, autofill passwords, and complete payments with Apple Pay. Where a user looks stays private while navigating Vision Pro, and eye tracking information is not shared with Apple, third-party apps, or websites. EyeSight also includes a visual indicator that makes it clear to others when a user is capturing a spatial photo or video.

                 <div>As with all Apple products, powerful accessibility features have been built right into visionOS. Key accessibility features like VoiceOver, Zoom, Switch Control, Guided Access, and more have been reimagined for spatial computing. Users can interact with Apple Vision Pro entirely with their eyes, hands, or voice, or any combination that works best for them. They can select a preferred input method such as their eyes, finger, or wrist using Pointer Control, pause on an element of visionOS for a few seconds to simulate a tap using Dwell Control, or simply use voice commands for activities across Vision Pro using Voice Control. If input from both eyes is not an option, visionOS also allows eye tracking with one dominant eye.

                 <div>Apple Vision Pro is designed with the environment in mind, with 100 percent recycled rare earth elements in all magnets and 100 percent recycled tin soldering and gold plating in multiple printed circuit boards. The frame and battery enclosure contain 100 percent recycled aluminum, and the Light Seal and Solo Knit Band are each made with over 70 percent recycled yarn. Vision Pro meets Apple’s high standards for energy efficiency and is free of mercury, brominated flame retardants, PVC, and beryllium. The packaging is 100 percent fiber-based, bringing Apple closer to its goal of eliminating plastics in all packaging by 2025.

<h2 id="why-arent-we-sieve-ing">Why Aren’t We SIEVE-ing?</h2>

<p>Captain, we are being scanned!</p>

<p>Long-time readers of this blog will know that I have mixed feelings about caches. One on hand, caching is critical to the performance of systems at every layer, from CPUs to storage to whole distributed architectures. On the other hand, caching being this critical means that designers need to carefully consider what happens when the cache is emptied, and they don’t always do that well<sup><a href="#foot1">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Because of how important caches are, I follow the literature in the area fairly closely. Even to a casual observer, it’s obvious that there’s one group of researchers who’ve been on a bit of a tear recently, including Juncheng Yang, Yazhuo Zhang, K. V. Rashmi, and Yao Yue in various combinations. Their recent papers include <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/osdi20-yang.pdf">a real-world analysis of cache systems at Twitter</a>, <a href="https://jasony.me/publication/hotos23-qdlp.pdf">an analysis of the dynamics of cache eviction</a>, and <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3600006.3613147">a novel FIFO-based cache design with some interesting properties</a>.</p>

<p>The most interesting one to me, which I expect anybody who enjoys a good algorithm will get a kick out of, is the eviction algorithm <a href="https://junchengyang.com/publication/nsdi24-SIEVE.pdf">SIEVE</a> (their paper is coming up at NSDI’24). SIEVE is an <em>eviction algorithm</em>, a way of deciding which cached item to toss out when a new one needs to be put in. There are hundreds of these in the literature. At least. Classics including throwing out the least recently inserted thing (FIFO), least recently accessed thing (LRU), thing that’s been accessed least often (LFU), and even just a random thing. Eviction is interesting because it’s a tradeoff between accuracy, speed (how much work is needed on each eviction and each access), and metadata size. The slower the algorithm, the less latency and efficiency benefit from caching. The larger the metadata, the less space there is to store actual data.</p>

<p>SIEVE performs well. In their words:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Moreover, SIEVE has a lower miss ratio than 9 state-of-the-art algorithms on more than 45% of the 1559 traces, while the next best algorithm only has a lower miss ratio on 15%.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What’s super interesting about SIEVE is that it’s both very effective, and an extremely simple change on top of a basic FIFO queue. Here’s Figure 1 from <a href="https://junchengyang.com/publication/nsdi24-SIEVE.pdf">their paper</a> with the pseudocode:</p>

<p><img src="https://brooker.co.za/blog/images/sieve_figure_1.png" alt=""></p>

<p>The only other change is to set <code>obj.visited</code> on access. Like the classic <a href="https://www.multicians.org/paging-experiment.pdf">CLOCK</a> (from the 1960s!), and unlike the classic implementation of LRU, SIEVE doesn’t require changing the queue order on access, which reduces the synchronization needed in a multi-tenant setting. All it needs on access is to set a <code>bool</code>, which is a simple atomic operation on most processors. That’s something of a big deal, for an algorithm that performs so well.</p>

<h2 id="why-arent-we-all-sieve-ing">Why aren’t we all SIEVE-ing?</h2>

<p>SIEVE raises an interesting question - if it’s so effective, and so simple, and so closely related to an algorithm that’s been around forever, why has nobody discovered it already? It’s possible they have, but I haven’t seen it before, and the authors say they haven’t either. Their hypothesis is an interesting one:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In block cache workloads, which frequently feature scans, popular objects often intermingle with objects from scans. Consequently, both types of objects are rapidly evicted after insertion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We conjecture that not being scan-resistant is probably the reason why SIEVE remained undiscovered over the decades of caching research, which has been mostly focused on page and block accesses.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s believable. Scan resistance is important, and has been the focus of a lot of caching improvements over the decades<sup><a href="#foot2">2</a></sup>. Still, it’s hard to believe that folks kept finding this, and kept going <em>nah, not scan resistant</em> and tossing it out. Fascinating how these things are discovered.</p>

<p>Scan-resistance is important for block and file workloads because these workloads tend to be a mix of random access (<em>update that database page</em>, <em>move that file</em>) and large sequential access (<em>backup the whole database</em>, <em>do that unindexed query</em>). We don’t want the hot set of the cache that makes the random accesses fast evicted to make room for the sequential<sup><a href="#foot4">4</a></sup> pages that likely will never be accessed again<sup><a href="#foot3">3</a></sup>.</p>

<h2 id="a-scan-resistant-sieve">A Scan-Resistant SIEVE?</h2>

<p>This little historical mystery raises the question of whether there are similarly simple, but more scan-resistant, approaches to cache eviction. One such algorithm, which I’ll call SIEVE-k, involves making a small change to SIEVE.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Each item is given a small counter rather than a single access bit,</li>
  <li>On access the small counter is incremented rather than set, saturating at the value <code>k</code>,</li>
  <li>When the eviction <code>hand</code> goes past, the counter is decremented (saturating at 0), rather than reset.</li>
</ul>

<p>My claim here is that the eviction counter will go up for the most popular objects, causing them to be skipped in the round of evictions kicked off by the scan. This approach has some downsides. One is that eviction goes from worst-case <code>O(N)</code> to worst-case <code>O(kN)</code>, and the average case eviction also seems to go up by <code>k</code> (although I don’t love my analysis there). The other is that this could delay eviction of things that need to be evicted. Balancing these things, the most interesting variant of SIEVE-k is probably SIEVE-2 (along with SIEVE-1, which is the same as Zhang et al’s original algorithm).</p>

<h2 id="does-it-work">Does It Work?</h2>

<p>Yeah. Sort of. First, let’s consider a really trivial case of a Zipf-distributed <em>base</em> workload, and a periodic linear scan workload that turns on and off. In this simple setting SIEVE-2 out-performs SIEVE-1 across the board (lower miss rates are better).</p>

<p><img src="https://brooker.co.za/blog/images/sieve_k_results.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Clearly, with the 16MiB cache size here, SIEVE-2 and SIEVE-3 are doing a better job than SIEVE of keeping the scan from emptying out the cache. Beyond this magic size, it performs pretty much identically to SIEVE-1.</p>

<p>But the real-world is more complicated than that. Using the excellent open source <a href="https://github.com/cacheMon/libCacheSim">libCacheSim</a> I tried SIEVE-2 against SIEVE on a range of real-world traces. It was worse than SIEVE across the board on web-cache style KV workloads, as expected. Performance on block workloads<sup><a href="#foot5">5</a></sup> was a real mixed bag, with some wins and some losses. So it seems like SIEVE-k is potentially interesting, but isn’t a win over SIEVE more generally.</p>

<p>If you’d like to experiment some more, I’ve implemented SIEVE-k in <a href="https://github.com/mbrooker/libCacheSim">a fork of libCacheSim</a>.</p>

<h2 id="updates">Updates</h2>

<p><a name="updates"></a>The inimitable Keegan Carruthers-Smith writes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I believe there is an improvement on your worst case for SIEVE-k eviction from O(kN) to O(N):
When going through the list, keep track of the minimum counter seen.  Then if you do not evict on the first pass, decrement by that minimum value.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which is, indeed, correct and equivalent to what my goofy k-pass approach was doing (only <code>k/2</code> times more efficient). He also pointed out that other optimizations are possible, but probably not that interesting for small <code>k</code>.</p>

<p>And, on the fediverse, Tobin Baker pointed out something important about SIEVE compared to FIFO and CLOCK: removing items from the middle of the list (rather than the head or tail only) means that the simple <code>circular array</code> approach doesn’t work. The upshot is needing <code>O(log N)</code> additional state<sup><a href="#foot6">6</a></sup> to keep a linked list. Potentially an interesting line of investigation for implementations that are very memory overhead sensitive or CPU cache locality sensitive (and scanning through entries in a random order rather than sequentially). Tobin then <a href="https://fediscience.org/@tobinbaker@discuss.systems/111660149084030363">pointed out an interesting potential fix</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A simple fix to the SIEVE algorithm to accommodate circular arrays would be to move the current tail entry into the evicted entry’s slot (much like CLOCK copies a new entry into the evicted entry’s slot). This is really not very different from the FIFO-reinsertion algorithm, except that its promotion method (moving promoted entries to evicted slots) preserves the SIEVE invariant of keeping new entries to the right of the “hand” and old entries to the left.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This one is interesting, and I don’t have a good intuition for how it would affect performance (or whether the analogy to FIFO-reinsertion is correct). Implementing it in libCacheSim would likely sort that out.</p>

<p><strong>Footnotes</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li><a name="foot1"></a> Partially because it’s hard to do. <a href="https://brooker.co.za/blog/2022/06/02/formal.html">We need better tools</a> for reasoning about system behavior.</li>
  <li><a name="foot2"></a> Including Betty O’Neil’s <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/170036.170081">The LRU-K Page Replacement Algorithm For Database Disk Buffer</a>, a classic approach to scan resistance from the 90s database literature.</li>
  <li><a name="foot3"></a> It’s worth mentioning that some caches solve this by hoping that clients will let them know when data is only going to be accessed once (like with <code>POSIX_FADV_NOREUSE</code> and <code>POSIX_FADV_DONTNEED</code>). This can be super effective with the right discipline, but storage systems <em>in general</em> can’t make these kinds of assumptions (and often don’t have these kinds of interfaces at all).</li>
  <li><a name="foot4"></a> I say <em>sequential</em> here, but it’s really not sequential access that matters. What matters is that scans tend to happen at a high rate, and that they introduce a lot of <em>one hit wonders</em> (pages that are read once and never again, and therefore are not worth caching). Neither of those criteria need sequential access, but it happens to be true that they come along most often during sequential accesses.</li>
  <li><a name="foot5"></a> Block traces are interesting, because they tend to represent a kind of residue of accesses after the <em>easy</em> caching has already been done (by the database engine or OS page cache), and so represent a pretty tough case for cache algorithms in general.</li>
  <li><a name="foot6"></a> Which can be halved by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XOR_linked_list">committing unspeakable evil</a>.</li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><time datetime="2024-01-08T10:31:15">Published on January 8, 2024</time></p>
<p>Last year, Big Tech companies (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, and Microsoft) received about<strong> $3.04 billion in fines for breaking laws on both sides of the Atlantic</strong>. <strong>As of seven days and three hours into 2024</strong><strong>, they had already earned enough revenue to pay it all off</strong>.</p>



<p>A little over a week of operations is all it would take if the companies tackled their fines one after another. If they each paid their fines simultaneously, Meta would be the last to finish after five days and 13 hours.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This shows how insignificant these fines are for companies whose revenues are often larger than countries’ GDPs. In fact, 2023 was the second straight year these five companies were <a rel="" target="_self" href="https://proton.me/blog/big-tech-three-billion-fines">fined over $3 billion<span>(new window)</span></a>, showing that they view fines as nothing more than the cost of doing business.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This also assumes these companies act in good conscience and pay their fines promptly. Unfortunately, there’s no late payment penalty for Big Tech — and they often delay for years. It’s just another instance of Big Tech using its overwhelming revenue to bend or avoid the rules that govern the rest of us. Clearly, the current remedies for antitrust and privacy breaches are not having the desired effect.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Big Tech annual revenue dwarfs total fines</h2>



<p>We <a rel="" target="_self" href="https://proton.me/blog/big-tech-bigger-fines">published an article<span>(new window)</span></a> in August 2023 showing that the fines Big Tech companies received by that point in the year, some $2.3 billion, were inconsequential compared to their income. We thought it would be good to revisit those figures at the end of the year. We’ve calculated the average revenue earned per hour for each company using the latest figures reported. (We explain the sources we used for calculating this table at the bottom of this article.)</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Company</strong></th><th><strong>Revenue earned per hour</strong></th><th><strong>How long it takes to earn $1 billion</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204423000094/goog-20230930.htm">Alphabet<span>(new window)</span></a> (for the first three quarters of 2023)</td><td>$33.74 million&nbsp;</td><td>1 day, 5 hours, 35 minutes</td></tr><tr><td><a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://s2.q4cdn.com/299287126/files/doc_financials/2023/q3/AMZN-Q3-2023-Earnings-Release.pdf">Amazon<span>(new window)</span></a> (for the first three quarters of 2023)</td><td>$61.79 million</td><td>16 hours, 10 minutes</td></tr><tr><td><a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://s2.q4cdn.com/470004039/files/doc_earnings/2023/q4/filing/_10-K-Q4-2023-As-Filed.pdf">Apple<span>(new window)</span></a> (for the fiscal year ending Sept. 30, 2023)</td><td>$43.75 million</td><td>22 hours, 50 minutes</td></tr><tr><td><a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001326801/29804645-5034-420a-82b6-54f869ec422b.html#">Meta<span>(new window)</span></a> (for the first three quarters of 2023)</td><td>$12.89 million</td><td>3 days, 3 hours, 35 minutes</td></tr><tr><td><a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https://c.s-microsoft.com/en-us/CMSFiles/MSFT_FY23Q4_10K.docx?version=d86a284d-dfce-35ee-366c-d754d90f9174">Microsoft<span>(new window)</span></a> (for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2023)</td><td>$24.19 million</td><td>1 day, 17 hours, 20 minutes</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>We also included fines these companies received in 2023 in the months after our article was published, such as a $700 million settlement in a case against Alphabet (Google) for how it <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/google-pay-700-million-us-043053930.html">illegally blocked competition on the Google Play Store<span>(new window)</span></a> that came out in December.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The updated table below shows the 2023 fine totals for each company, along with how long it would take them to pay off those fines with their 2023 average hourly revenue.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Company</strong></th><th><strong>2023 total fines</strong></th><th><strong>Company</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Alphabet</td><td>$941 million</td><td>1 day, 3 hours, 55 minutes</td></tr><tr><td>Amazon</td><td>$111.7 million</td><td>1 hour, 50 minutes</td></tr><tr><td>Apple</td><td>$186.4 million</td><td>4 hours, 15 minutes</td></tr><tr><td>Meta</td><td>$1.72 billion</td><td>5 days, 13 hours, 25 minutes</td></tr><tr><td>Microsoft</td><td>$84 million</td><td>3 hours, 30 minutes</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Total fines</strong></td><td><strong>$3.04 billion</strong></td><td><strong>7 days, 3 hours</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption>For Apple and Microsoft, we calculated the average revenue per hour using the annual revenue amount in their 10-K report for their 2023 fiscal year (dates are noted in the table). We then divided that amount by 365 and then divided the resulting amount by 24 to reach the hourly average.<p>Alphabet (Google), Amazon, and Meta (Facebook) don’t release their annual financial statements until the beginning of February, so we calculated the average revenue per hour using the revenue they reported for the first nine months of 2023 in their September 10-Q report. We then divided that amount by 273 (the number of days in a year through Sept. 30) and then divided the resulting amount by 24 to reach the hourly average.</p></figcaption></figure>



<h2>Delay, delay, delay</h2>



<p>Big Tech companies can further water down the potential sting of these fines by <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.barrons.com/news/how-big-tech-generated-billions-in-fines-then-didn-t-pay-them-ab5d0a77">delaying payment for years<span>(new window)</span></a>. They’ve done this by filing appeals, counter-suing, or simply refusing to pay. Some notable examples include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Amazon continues to contest its <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-58024116">$886 million fine from the Luxembourg DPA in 2021<span>(new window)</span></a>.</li>



<li>Google somehow still arguing against $8 billion in antitrust fines from the EU in <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/es/MEMO_17_1785">2017<span>(new window)</span></a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/18/17580694/google-android-eu-fine-antitrust">2018<span>(new window)</span></a>, and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/20/18270891/google-eu-antitrust-fine-adsense-advertising">2019<span>(new window)</span></a>.</li>



<li>Google telling the Indian government that it <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.businesstoday.in/technology/news/story/google-refuses-to-pay-fine-in-india-even-though-it-paid-fine-in-same-case-in-europe-ccis-lawyer-360460-2023-01-16">simply refuses to pay their fines<span>(new window)</span></a>.</li>
</ul>



<p>Every company has the right to appeal, and privacy abuses and antitrust cases are notoriously complicated and often governed by laws that were written well before the internet was invented, meaning a great deal of interpretation is necessary. Still, it’s not a sign of a functioning justice system for appeals to take such a long time while people continue to suffer data abuses and unfair high prices. Those with the deepest pockets can often drag out litigation well after it’s clear they have no chance of winning, taking time and resources away from regulators’ efforts to create a level playing field in the market.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Weak fines are not a deterrent</h2>



<p>These paltry fines aren’t helpful if you think a fine should function as a punishment for poor corporate governance or an incentive for companies to change their behavior. If a company can pay off a fine with less than a week’s revenue or avoid paying it entirely for half a decade, then it won’t cause executives to tread cautiously.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, despite Meta racking up nearly $2 billion in fines and Google nearly $1 billion, both Mark Zuckerberg and Sundar Pichai remain secure in their CEO posts. While other CEOs might be ousted immediately if their companies were fined billions of dollars year after year, investors and board members are willing to accept them at Big Tech companies because $1 billion represents less than 1% of these company’s total revenue. They view these fines as nothing more than the cost of doing business under the surveillance capitalism business model. And as their balance sheets show, business remains good.</p>



<p>This is important because the internet has become one of the most (arguably the most) important pieces of global public infrastructure the world has ever seen. It connects billions of people to their friends and family, to gainful employment, to entertainment, to essential information, and more. Despite how essential it is to the global economy and society, governments around the world have allowed Big Tech to bend the internet to their will.</p>



<p>Big Tech believes the internet belongs to them, that they can use their size and wealth to <a rel="" target="_self" href="https://proton.me/blog/how-big-tech-tracks-users">gather people’s private information with impunity<span>(new window)</span></a> and <a rel="" target="_self" href="https://proton.me/blog/search-risk-google">block people from choosing competitors<span>(new window)</span></a> that might offer more privacy.</p>



<h2>We all must fight for a better internet</h2>



<p>Big Tech knows people want privacy. It’s why <a rel="" target="_self" href="https://proton.me/blog/google-privacy-washing">Google<span>(new window)</span></a> and Apple have launched major ad campaigns talking about how they give you control of your data. However, if you look at the features they’re producing, they continue to search for new ways to collect people’s data, from <a rel="" target="_self" href="https://proton.me/blog/privacy-metaverse">launching metaverses<span>(new window)</span></a> to <a rel="" target="_self" href="https://proton.me/blog/google-privacy-washing-android">following your activity in other apps<span>(new window)</span></a>, showing they aren’t taking regulators seriously.</p>



<p>If we want to take back control of the internet, several things must happen.&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>First, governments must combat Big Tech. They must impose fines that get Big Tech’s attention for breaching user privacy and locking competitors out of the market.</li>



<li>But fines can only be part of the solution. Regulators, armed with strong antitrust legislation, must strongly challenge mergers that create massive monopolies. They must encourage competition and empower people to choose the service that is best for them.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>There are several opportunities for legislators to empower regulators to ensure fair competition and protect people’s rights in the coming year, such as with the Digital Markets, Consumer and Competition Bill in the UK that’s currently going through Parliament. Similar legislative initiatives have started in South Korea and Japan, as well.</p>



<p>But until governments step in, you must protect your information yourself. If you remove your personal data from Big Tech’s reach, not only are you protecting your privacy, you’re also depriving Big Tech of the ability to sell targeted ads.&nbsp;</p>

Also, this table excludes several censorship fines from Russia that seem motivated by Big Tech’s refusal to remove news about Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Also, due to the fluctuation of foreign exchange rates, the dollar amounts might have shifted since this article was published.</figcaption></figure>
