<p>- Vi er veldig glade for at Personvernrådet er enige i Datatilsynets vurderinger og utvider forbudet vårt. Målet er at innbyggere over hele Europa vil få bedre personvern, sier direktør i Datatilsynet Line Coll.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Datatilsynet er svært bekymret for den ulovlige sporingen, overvåkingen og profileringen som skjer på Facebook og Instagram. Selv om det lenge har vært klart at Meta bryter loven, og på tross av Datatilsynets forbud i Norge, fortsetter Meta med sin ulovlig behandling av personopplysninger. Dette er grunnen til at vi har valgt å løfte saken til Personvernrådet (EDPB), som nå har sagt seg enige i at det haster med et permanent forbud mot de ulovlige aktivitetene på europeisk nivå.</p>
<p>Facebook og Instagram har over 250 millioner aktive brukere i EU/EØS.</p>
<p>Personvernrådets vedtak er en instruks til det irske datatilsynet om å nedlegge et permanent forbud ovenfor Metas europeiske hovedkontor i Irland. Når dette har skjedd vil forbudet begynne å gjelde.</p>
<p>- Nok er nok. Etter over fem år med krenkelse av brukernes grunnleggende personvern, setter Personvernrådet nå ned foten mot Metas manglende respekt for loven, sier leder for internasjonal seksjon, Tobias Judin.</p>
<p>Meta har&nbsp;fått klar beskjed om at forretningsmodellen deres og bruken av personopplysninger strider med det europeiske personvernregelverket. De har sagt at de vil be brukerne om samtykke til å bruke dataene deres til adferdsbasert markedsføring i fremtiden. Selskapet har imidlertid ikke innført noen konkrete endringer ennå, og dermed fortsetter de ulovlige aktivitetene fortløpende.</p>
<p>Datatilsynet er dessuten i sterk tvil om Metas foreslåtte samtykkeløsning,&nbsp;som innebærer at de som ikke samtykker til adferdsbasert markedsføring må betale en avgift, vil være lovlig. Personvernrådets avgjørelse er derfor viktig for å unngå at&nbsp;Metas lovbrudd fortsetter mens selskapet leter etter en lovlig måte å innrette seg på.&nbsp;</p>

<div>
    <h2 id="faq">Frequently asked questions</h2>
    
<h2 id="what-is-openrw">What is OpenRW</h2>
<p>OpenRW is an open-source game engine that attempts to re-implement the engine used in the classic video game Grand Theft Auto III (GTA III), first released in 2001. With the purpose of enabling better compatibility with modern systems and ensuring that it remains possible to play the game in the future.</p>

<p>The primary goal of the project is to reach “Version 1.0”, this would mean:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fully implementing the original gameplay</li>
  <li>Compatible with all data formats used in the game</li>
  <li>Compatible with modern gamepads where possible</li>
  <li>Able to load save game files from the game</li>
  <li>Run with community made mods that only change game data</li>
  <li>Run natively on Windows, Linux and macOS</li>
</ul>

<p>OpenRW would not aim for Version 1.0 to re-create any obvious bugs such as crashes or situations where the game becomes impossible to progress.</p>

<p>Other features, which would not be needed for Version 1.0 include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Enhanced support for user modification</li>
  <li>Changes to the gameplay</li>
  <li>Multiplayer</li>
</ul>

<p>Features like these will not be accepted into OpenRW at present, as these don’t contribute to the primary goal. Once Version 1.0 has been reached a “new” version of OpenRW may be forked that contains these kinds of features.</p>

<h2 id="do-i-need-gta-iii-to-play-openrw">Do I need GTA III to play OpenRW?</h2>
<p>In short: Yes.</p>

<p>OpenRW is simply a game engine that is compatible with the original game, it has no assets of its own. In order to play GTA III using  OpenRW you must own the game and have the data installed on your system. If you need a copy of the game it’s available on <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/12100/">Steam</a>.</p>

<p>It is theoretically possible to develop a completely new game, without any of the assets or content from GTA III, however no such project is currently under way.</p>

<h2 id="can-i-play-openrw-now">Can I play OpenRW now?</h2>
<p>In its current state it is not possible to complete the game using OpenRW, or make any significant progress through the game. There are many bugs that need to be fixed and features that need to be developed before it becomes possible to play anything with OpenRW. The latest version of OpenRW will always be available from the source code <a href="https://github.com/rwengine/openrw">repository</a>.</p>

<h2 id="can-i-play-openrw-on-my-macos--linux-computer">Can I play OpenRW on my macOS / Linux computer?</h2>
<p>Yes. OpenRW runs on macOS and Linux, as well as some BSDs.</p>

<h2 id="why-make-openrw">Why make OpenRW?</h2>
<p>Beyond technical curiosity, OpenRW exists to conserve the game and ensure it is playable into the future by improving compatibility with modern systems and allowing future developers to make the engine compatible with whatever systems may exist in the future.</p>

<p>In addition to conservation it may also offer a platform for others to build 3D action games in the future.</p>

<h2 id="can-i-contribute-to-openrw">Can I contribute to OpenRW?</h2>
<p>Yes, development of OpenRW is open, you can follow along and contribute via the GitHub <a href="https://github.com/rwengine/openrw">project page</a>. Also drop into the IRC channel, <code>#openrw</code> @ <a href="https://web.libera.chat/#openrw">irc.libera.chat</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-licence-is-openrw-released-under">What licence is OpenRW released under</h2>
<p>The OpenRW engine is released under the GNU General Public License Version 3.</p>

<h2 id="who-is-working-on-openrw">Who is working on OpenRW?</h2>
<p>The project is developed in an open and collaborative manner, anyone who wishes to contribute code or documentation is able to send changes via a pull request to the github <a href="https://github.com/rwengine/openrw">repository</a>.</p>

<h2 id="will-it-be-possible-to-play-vice-city-with-openrw">Will it be possible to play Vice City with OpenRW?</h2>
<p>The current priority of the project is to implement support for playing GTA III. Once this is completed it will be clear how much extra work will be required to fully support Vice City in addition to III. The work may need to be done in a fork of OpenRW dedicated to Vice CIty, or it may be unfeasible for one reason or another.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-the-story">What is the story?</h2>
<p>Development on OpenRW was started by tsjost and danhedron in 2013,  where it began as a simple model viewer that became a map viewer. Over time OpenRW has gained new features such as physics, vehicles and pedestrians, and a script machine that make more of the game accessible via the OpenRW engine. Now it is possible to start a new game or load a save game within OpenRW and interact with the world.
At present, development is performed in the open where anyone is free to contribute to the project via the github repository.</p>

			<p><em>25 December 2016</em></p>

			<p>Data outlives code, and a valuable database supports many applications over time. These ten rules will help grow your database schema without breaking your applications.<br></p><p><a href="https://blog.datomic.com/images/blog/-53l7suMbyss/WDw4_QYOk5I/AAAAAAAAANQ/MmACZ8DAbKsE8tE4BzI4I6Y81tt18aJtwCPcB/s1600/DatomicLogo_Square.png" imageanchor="1"><img height="199" src="https://blog.datomic.com/images/blog/-53l7suMbyss/WDw4_QYOk5I/AAAAAAAAANQ/MmACZ8DAbKsE8tE4BzI4I6Y81tt18aJtwCPcB/s200/DatomicLogo_Square.png" width="200"></a></p><h3>1. &nbsp;Prod is not like dev.</h3><p>Production is not development. In production, one or more codebases depend on your data, and these ten rules below should be followed exactingly.</p><p>A dev environment can be much more relaxed. &nbsp;Alone on your development machine experimenting with a new feature, you have no users to break. &nbsp;You can soften the rules, so long as you harden them when transitioning to production.</p><h3>2. &nbsp;Grow your schema, and never break it.</h3><p>The lack of common vocabulary makes it all too easy to automate the wrong practices. I will use the terms <i>growth</i> and <i>breakage</i> as defined in Rich Hickey's&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyLBGkS5ICk" target="_blank">Spec-ulation</a>&nbsp;talk. &nbsp;In schema terms:</p><ul><li><i>growth</i> is providing more schema</li><li><i>breakage</i> is removing schema, or changing the meaning of existing schema.</li></ul><p>In contrast to these terms, many people use "<a href="http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_migrations.html" target="_blank">migrations</a>", "<a href="http://databaserefactoring.com/" target="_blank">refactoring</a>", or "<a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/evodb.html" target="_blank">evolution</a>". These usages tend to focus on repeatability, convenience, and the needs of new programs, ignoring the distinction between growth and breakage. The problem here is obvious: Breakage is bad, so we don't want it to be more convenient!</p><p>Using precise language underscores the costs of of breakage. Most migrations are easily categorized as growth or breakage by considering the rules below. &nbsp;<i>Growth migrations</i> are suitable for production, and <i>breakage migrations</i> are, at best, a dev-only convenience. Keep them widely separate.</p><h3>3. The database is the source of truth.</h3><p>Schema growth needs to be reproducible from one environment to another. &nbsp;Reproducibility supports the development and testing of new schema before putting it into production and also the reuse of schema in different databases. Schema growth also needs to be evident in the database itself, so that you can determine what the database has, what it needs, and when growth occurred.</p><p>For both of these reasons, the database is the proper source of truth for schema growth. When the database is the source of truth, reproducability and auditability happen <i>for free</i>&nbsp;via the ordinary<br>query and transaction capabilities of the database. &nbsp;(If your database is not up to the tasks of queries and transactions you have bigger problems beyond the scope of this article).</p><p>Storing schema in a database is strictly more powerful than storing schema as text files in source control. The database is the actual home for schema, plus it provides validation, structure, query, transactions, and history. A source control system provides only history and is separate from the data itself.</p><p>Note that this does <i>not</i> mean "never put schema information in source control". Source control may be convenient for other reasons, e.g. it may be more readily accessible. You may redundantly store schema in source control, but remember that the database is definitive.</p><h3>4. &nbsp;Growing is adding.</h3><p>As you acquire more information about your domain, grow your schema to match. You can grow a schema by adding new things, and <i>only</i> by adding new things, for example:</p><ul><li>adding new attributes to an existing 'type'</li><li>adding new types</li><li>adding relationships between types</li></ul><h3>5. &nbsp;Never remove a name.</h3><p>Removing a named schema component at any level is a breaking change for programs that depend on that name. Never remove a name.</p><h3>6. &nbsp;Never reuse a name.</h3><p>The meaning of a name is established when the name is first introduced. Reusing that name to mean something substantially different breaks programs that depend on that meaning. This can be even<br>worse than removing the name, as the breakage may not be as immediately obvious.</p><h3>7. &nbsp;Use aliases.</h3><p>If you are familiar with database refactoring patterns, the advice in Rules Five and Six may seem stark. After all, one purpose of refactoring is to adopt better names as we discover them. How can we<br>do that if names can never be removed or changed in meaning?</p><p>The simple solution is to use <a href="http://docs.datomic.com/schema.html#renaming-an-identity" target="_blank">more than one alias</a> to refer to the same schema entity. Consider the following example:</p><ul><li>In iteration 1, users of your system are identified by their email with an attribute named <span><b>:user/id</b></span>.&nbsp;</li><li>In iteration 2, you discover that users sometimes have non-email identifiers for users and that you want to store a user's email even when not using the email as an identifier. In short, you wish that <span><b>:user/id</b></span>&nbsp;was named <span><b>:user/primary-email</b></span>.</li></ul><p>No problem! Just create <span><b>:user/primary-email</b></span> as an alias for <span><b>:user/id</b></span>. Older programs can continue to use <span><b>:user/id</b></span>, and newer programs can use the now-preferred <span><b>:user/primary-email</b></span>.</p><h3>8. &nbsp;Namespace all names.</h3><p>Namespaces greatly reduce the cost of getting a name wrong, as the same local name can safely have different meanings in different namespaces. &nbsp;Continuing the previous example, imagine that the local<br>name <span><b>id</b></span> is used to refer to a UUID in several namespaces, e.g. <span><b>:inventory/id</b></span>, <span><b>:order/id</b></span>, and so on. The fact that <span><b>:user/id&nbsp;</b></span>is <i>not</i> a UUID is inconsistent, and newer programs should not have to put up with this.</p><p>Namespaces let you improve the situation without breaking existing programs. You can introduce <span><b>:user-v2/id</b></span>, and new programs can ignore names in the&nbsp;<b><span>user</span></b>&nbsp;namespace. If you don't like <b><span>v2</span></b>, you can also pick a more semantic name for the new namespace.</p><h3>9. &nbsp;Annotate your schema.</h3><p>Databases are good at storing data about your schema. Adding annotations to your schema can help both human readers and make sense of how the schema grew over time. For example:</p><ul><li>you could annotate names that are not recommended for new programs with a <span><b>:schema/deprecated</b></span> flag, or you could get fancier still with <span><b>:schema/deprecated-at</b></span> or <span><b>:schema/deprecated-because</b></span>. Note that such deprecated names are still <i>never</i> removed (Rule Five).</li><li>you could provide <span><b>:schema/see-also</b></span> or <span><b>:schema/see-instead</b></span> pointers to more current conventions.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>In fact, all the database refactoring patterns that are typically implemented as breaking changes could be implemented non-destructively, with the refactoring details recorded as an annotation. For example, the breaking <a href="http://databaserefactoring.com/SplitColumns.html" target="_blank">"split column" refactoring</a>&nbsp;might instead be implemented as schema growth:</p><ul><li>add N new columns</li><li>(optional) add a <span><b>:schema/split-into</b></span> attribute on the original column whose value is the new columns, and possibly even the recipe for the split</li></ul><h3>10. Plan for accretion.</h3><p>If a system is going to grow at all, then programs must not bake in limiting presumptions. &nbsp;For example: If a schema states that <span><b>:user/id</b></span> is a string, then programs can rely on <span><b>:user/id</b></span> being a string and not occasionally an integer or a boolean. &nbsp;But a program cannot assume that a user entity will be limited to a the set of attributes previously seen, or that it understands the semantics of attributes that it has not seen before.</p><h3>Are these rules specific to a particular database?</h3><p>No. These rules apply to almost any SQL or NoSQL database. &nbsp;The rules even apply to the so-called "schemaless" databases. &nbsp;A better word for schemaless is "schema-implicit", i.e. the schema is implicit in your data and the database has no reified awareness of it. &nbsp;With an implicit schema, all the rules still apply, except that the database is impotent to help you (no Rule 3).</p><h3>In Context</h3><p>Many of the resources on migrations, refactoring, and database evolution emphasize repeatability and the needs of new programs, without making the top-level distinctions of growth vs. breakage and prod vs. dev. As a result, these resources encourage breaking the rules in this article.</p><p>Happily, these resources can easily be recast in growth-only terms. &nbsp;You <i>can</i> grow your schema without breaking your app. You <i>can</i> continuously deploy without continuously propagating breakage. &nbsp;Here's what it looks like <a href="http://docs.datomic.com/best-practices.html#production-schema" target="_blank">in Datomic</a>.</p>

                <h2 id="user-content-what-happened"><a href="#what-happened">What happened?</a></h2>
<p>macOS Sonoma and macOS Ventura 13.6 were released with multiple serious bugs in their upgrade and boot process. Combined, these bugs can create conditions where a machine always boots to a black screen, no matter what power button press combination is used. This leaves users stuck, and the only solution is to use DFU recovery.</p>
<p>This situation can happen with certain settings on certain models, when multiple macOS versions are installed side by side (one Sonoma, one earlier). Since Asahi Linux behaves as if it were macOS 12.3/12.4/13.5 (depending on model and installation time), dual-boot installs of macOS Sonoma and Asahi Linux have the same effect. For macOS 13.6, this situation doesn't even require a dual-boot system, and can be triggered stand-alone as the only installed OS.</p>
<p><strong>We have updated the Asahi Linux installer to automatically perform an integrity check and diagnose your system on startup</strong>. To run it, paste this command into Terminal in macOS:</p>
<p><code>curl https://alx.sh | sh</code></p>
<p>You can quit the installer once you reach the main menu, without making any changes to your system.</p>
<p>Apple bug reports: FB13319681 and FB13319708</p>
<h2 id="user-content-what-are-the-bugs-exactly"><a href="#what-are-the-bugs-exactly">What are the bugs exactly</a></h2>
<p>There are two bugs:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>macOS Sonoma upgrades use the previously installed version as System Recovery. This makes some sense, but does not consider backwards compatibility problems between older RecoveryOS and newer firmware. If this mismatch causes recoveryOS to fail to boot, this will leave System Recovery unusable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For 14" and 16" models: Once System Firmware is updated to the macOS Sonoma version, if the display is configured to a refresh rate other than ProMotion, that system will no longer be able to boot into older macOS installs nor Asahi Linux correctly. This includes recovery mode when those systems are set as the default boot OS, <strong>and also System Recovery</strong> at least until the next subsequent OS upgrade.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="user-content-what-happens-if-i-get-hit-by-the-bug-will-i-lose-data"><a href="#what-happens-if-i-get-hit-by-the-bug-will-i-lose-data">What happens if I get hit by the bug? Will I lose data?</a></h2>
<p>You will need another Mac to recover from the fault using DFU mode. However, you will <em>not</em> lose data.</p>
<h2 id="user-content-what-machines-are-affected"><a href="#what-machines-are-affected">What machines are affected?</a></h2>
<p>MacBook Pro models with ProMotion displays (14" and 16") are affected by the black screen boot bug.</p>
<h2 id="user-content-what-versions-are-affected"><a href="#what-versions-are-affected">What versions are affected?</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>macOS Sonoma 14.0+ (not fixed as of 2023-10-31)</li>
<li>macOS Ventura 13.6+ (uses 14.0 firmware)</li>
<li>Possibly: macOS Monterey 12.7 (unconfirmed)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="user-content-what-should-i-do"><a href="#what-should-i-do">What should I do?</a></h2>
<h3 id="user-content-i-have-not-upgraded-to-macos-sonoma-or-macos-ventura-136-yet-and-i-want-to"><a href="#i-have-not-upgraded-to-macos-sonoma-or-macos-ventura-136-yet-and-i-want-to">I have not upgraded to macOS Sonoma (or macOS Ventura 13.6) yet and I want to</a></h3>
<p>We recommend waiting until these issues are fixed by Apple before upgrading. If you want to risk it and you have a 14" or 16" machine, <strong>make sure the display refresh rate is set to ProMotion</strong> before attempting the upgrade. You might still end up with a corrupted System Recovery, which can only be fixed with DFU mode or a subsequent successful upgrade.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether you plan to install Asahi Linux or not, we recommend running the Asahi Linux installer after a Sonoma upgrade to check the status of your System Recovery partition. It will inform you about any issues prior to the main menu, before any changes are made to your system.</p>
<h3 id="user-content-i-have-not-upgraded-to-macos-sonoma-or-macos-ventura-136-yet-and-im-in-no-rush"><a href="#i-have-not-upgraded-to-macos-sonoma-or-macos-ventura-136-yet-and-im-in-no-rush">I have not upgraded to macOS Sonoma (or macOS Ventura 13.6) yet and I'm in no rush</a></h3>
<p>Feel free to stay on macOS version 13.5 or earlier for the time being. You can safely install Asahi Linux if you wish.</p>
<h3 id="user-content-i-have-already-upgraded-to-macos-sonoma-and-i-want-to-install-asahi-linux"><a href="#i-have-already-upgraded-to-macos-sonoma-and-i-want-to-install-asahi-linux">I have already upgraded to macOS Sonoma and I want to install Asahi Linux</a></h3>
<p>The Asahi Linux installer has been updated to check the version of your System Recovery, and will inform you of the risks if there is a mismatch. It will also check the ProMotion refresh rate, and refuse to install if it is set to anything other than ProMotion mode. Therefore, it is safe to install at this time.</p>
<p>Start the installation process normally. Follow the prompts carefully and read all the information printed. If your System Recovery version is mismatched, make sure you understand the risks. If your display refresh rate is incorrect, the installer will ask you to change it.</p>
<h3 id="user-content-i-have-already-upgraded-to-macos-sonoma-and-i-have-asahi-linux"><a href="#i-have-already-upgraded-to-macos-sonoma-and-i-have-asahi-linux">I have already upgraded to macOS Sonoma and I have Asahi Linux</a></h3>
<p>If you are currently booted into macOS, ensure the display refresh rate is set to ProMotion (for 14" and 16" machines).</p>
<p>We recommend running the Asahi Linux installer again to verify the integrity of your System RecoveryOS partition and ProMotion status. If there is a problem, you should refrain from making any major changes to your system until the issue is fixed by Apple.</p>
<h3 id="user-content-i-am-affected-to-the-issue-what-do-i-do"><a href="#i-am-affected-to-the-issue-what-do-i-do">I am affected to the issue, what do I do?</a></h3>
<p>If your machine boots to a black screen (brief Apple logo, then nothing), first attempt a regular recoveryOS boot by fully powering down the machine, then holding down the power button.</p>
<p>If that does not work, try booting into System RecoveryOS. To do this, fully power down the machine, and then perform a fast "tap-and-hold" power button gesture (press and release once, then press and hold).</p>
<p>If that also leads to the same problem, unfortunately you will have to resort to DFU mode. See the following section for details.</p>
<p>If you can successfully reach a boot menu, select your macOS Sonoma install and hold down Option while confirming your selection to make it the default boot OS. <strong>If you have macOS 13.6 ventura instead, follow the special section below.</strong></p>
<h3 id="user-content-how-do-i-fix-my-machine-with-dfu-mode"><a href="#how-do-i-fix-my-machine-with-dfu-mode">How do I fix my machine with DFU mode?</a></h3>
<p>First, you will need another Mac running a recent version of macOS (an Intel Mac is OK). Install Apple Configurator from the App Store on the other Mac and open it.</p>
<p>Follow <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gu/guide/apple-configurator-mac/apdd5f3c75ad/mac" rel="nofollow">Apple's</a> instructions to connect your two machines together, and put your target machine in DFU mode. The target machine's display should remain off at this point.</p>
<p>You should see a large "DFU" icon in Apple Configurator. If you see anything else, the machine is not in the correct mode. Repeat the procedure and try again.</p>
<p>Once you see the DFU icon, right click it and select Advanced → Revive. This will begin the revive process.</p>
<p>If you get a message saying "A system update is required for this device", you can ignore it and press "Restore Anyway". This process has been tested with another Mac running macOS 13.5.</p>
<p>Follow the prompts and accept any accessory connection requests. Do not leave the machine unattended, as you might miss one of those prompts (and there is a timeout). The process will take a few minutes to complete.</p>
<p>Once the Revive process completes, the machine should boot into macOS Recovery. Follow the prompts and authenticate yourself.</p>
<p>After this, the machine will reboot into the Boot Picker.</p>
<p><strong>If you have macOS 13.6 ventura instead, follow the special section below.</strong></p>
<p>Select your macOS Sonoma install, then go into the Display settings page and set the display refresh rate to ProMotion. This will prevent the problem from reoccurring.</p>
<p>Should you wind up with a "black screen boot" again after this point, follow the steps in the previous section to perform the "tap-and-hold" power gesture. This should now work properly, as your System RecoveryOS has been updated. You may then select macOS again and fix the display refresh rate.</p>
<h3 id="user-content-i-dont-have-another-mac-to-use-dfu-mode-what-do-i-do"><a href="#i-dont-have-another-mac-to-use-dfu-mode-what-do-i-do">I don't have another Mac to use DFU mode! What do I do?</a></h3>
<p>You can take your Mac to the Apple Store and ask them to do a <strong>DFU Revive</strong>. Make sure they do <strong>not</strong> do a Restore, which would wipe all your data. They should perform this service for free. Do not let them charge you any money for it. This is a problem Apple caused, and purely a software issue. If the technicians claim there is hardware damage, they are wrong.</p>
<h3 id="user-content-what-if-i-have-macos-136-ventura-and-not-sonoma"><a href="#what-if-i-have-macos-136-ventura-and-not-sonoma">What if I have macOS 13.6 Ventura and not Sonoma?</a></h3>
<p>macOS 13.6 Ventura uses the macOS Sonoma System Firmware, but suffers from the problem. Even users with just 13.6 installed single-boot are affected by this issue (no Asahi Linux needed). We do not understand how Apple managed to release an OS update that, when upgraded to normally, leaves machines unbootable if their display refresh rate is not the default. This seems to have been a major QA oversight by Apple.</p>
<p>If your system has 13.6 Ventura and ended up in the black boot situation, unfortunately the only known solution is to upgrade to Sonoma. From the Boot Picker, select Settings. This will boot into recoveryOS. From there, select "Install macOS Sonoma". Follow the prompts and select your existing macOS volume. This will upgrade macOS without losing your data.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article role="article">
    <p>One of the biggest challenges for any software is to determine how changes impact user experience in the real world. Whether it’s the processing speed of video editing software or the smoothness of a browsing experience, there’s only so much you can tell from testing in a controlled lab environment. While local experiments can provide plenty of metrics, improvements to those metrics may not translate to a better user experience.</p>
<p>This can be especially challenging with complex client software running third-party code like Firefox, and it’s a big reason why we’ve undertaken the <a href="https://twitter.com/mozhacks/status/1603435347190419456">Speedometer 3 effort</a> alongside other web browsers. Our goal is to build performance tests that simulate real-world user experiences so that browsers have better tools to drive improvements for real users on real webpages. While it’s easy to see that benchmarks have improved in Firefox throughout the year as a result of this work, what we really care about is how much those wins are being felt by our users.</p>
<p>In order to measure the user experience, Firefox collects a wide range of anonymized timing metrics related to page load, responsiveness, startup and other aspects of browser performance. Collecting data while holding ourselves to the highest standards of privacy can be challenging. For example, because we rely on aggregated metrics, we lack the ability to pinpoint data from any particular website. But perhaps even more challenging is analyzing the data once collected and drawing actionable conclusions. In the future we’ll talk more about these challenges and how we’re addressing them, but in this post we’d like to share how some of the metrics that are fundamental to how our users experience the browser have improved throughout the year</p>
<p>Let’s start with page load. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/First_contentful_paint">First Contentful Paint</a> (FCP) is a better metric for felt performance than the `onload` event. We’re tracking the time it takes between receiving the first byte from the network to FCP. This tells us how much faster we are giving feedback to the user that the page is successfully loading, so it’s a critical metric for understanding the user experience. While much of this is up to web pages themselves, if the browser improves performance across the board, we expect this number to go down.</p>
<div id="attachment_48049"><p><a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2023/10/FCPRUM.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-48049" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" src="https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2023/10/FCPRUM-500x215.png" alt="Graph of the median time between response start and first contentful paint, going from ~250 to ~215.

<p>We can see that this time improved from roughly 250ms at the start of the year to 215ms in October. This means that a user receives feedback on page loads almost 15% faster than they did at the start of the year. And it’s important to note that this is all the result of optimization work that didn’t even explicitly target pageload.</p>
<p>In order to understand where this improvement is coming from, let’s look at another piece of timing data: the amount of time that was spent executing JavaScript code during a pageload. Here we are going to look at the 95th percentile, representing the most JS heavy pages and highlighting a big opportunity for us to remove friction for users..</p>
<div id="attachment_48050"><p><a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2023/10/JSPRUM.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-48050" decoding="async" src="https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2023/10/JSPRUM-500x215.png" alt="A graph of the 95th percentile of JS execution time during pageload. It runs from ~1560 in January 2023 to ~1260 by October 2023. In general it's a steady downward slope with a small downward jump in April and a large downward jump during August." width="500" height="215" srcset="https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2023/10/JSPRUM-500x215.png 500w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2023/10/JSPRUM-250x107.png 250w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2023/10/JSPRUM-768x330.png 768w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2023/10/JSPRUM-1536x659.png 1536w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2023/10/JSPRUM.png 1670w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-48050">Image 2 – 95th Percentile of JS execution time during pageload in milliseconds</p></div>
<p>This shows the 95th percentile improving from ~1560ms at the beginning of the year, to ~1260ms in October. This represents a considerable improvement of 300ms, or almost 20%, and is likely responsible for a significant portion of the reduced FCP times. This makes sense, since Speedometer 3 work has led to significant optimizations to the <a href="https://spidermonkey.dev/">SpiderMonkey</a> JavaScript engine (a story for another post).</p>
<p>We’d also like to know how responsive pages are after they are loaded. For example, how smooth is the response when typing on the keyboard as I write this blogpost! The primary metric we collect here is the “keypress present latency”; the time between a key being pressed on the keyboard and its result being presented onto the screen. Rendering some text to the screen may sound simple, but there’s a lot going on to make that happen – especially when web pages run main thread JavaScript to respond to the keypress event. Most typing is snappy and primarily limited by hardware (e.g. the refresh rate of the monitor), but it’s extremely disruptive when it’s not. This means it’s important to mitigate the worst cases, so we’ll again look at the 95th percentile.</p>
<div id="attachment_48048"><p><a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2023/10/KeypressRUM.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-48048" decoding="async" src="https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2023/10/KeypressRUM-500x215.png" alt="A graph of the 95th percentile of the keypress present latency. Ranging from January 2023 to October 2023. It hovers fairly steady around 65ms, even seemingly going up a bit between March and May. Before dropping down to about 58-59ms over the course of August and September 2023." width="500" height="215" srcset="https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2023/10/KeypressRUM-500x215.png 500w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2023/10/KeypressRUM-250x107.png 250w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2023/10/KeypressRUM-768x330.png 768w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2023/10/KeypressRUM-1536x659.png 1536w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2023/10/KeypressRUM.png 1670w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-48048">Image 3 – 95th Percentile of the keypress present latency</p></div>
<p>Once again we see a measurable improvement. The 95th percentile hovered around 65ms for most of the year and dropped to under 59ms after the Firefox 116 and 117 releases in August. A 10% improvement to the slowest keypresses means users are experiencing more instantaneous feedback and fewer disruptions while typing.</p>
<p>We’ve been motivated by the improvements we’re seeing in our telemetry data, and we’re convinced that our efforts this year are having a positive effect on Firefox users. We have many more optimizations in the pipeline and will share more details about those and our overall progress in future posts.</p>

        <div data-component-list="ModalGalleryTrigger">
             
                 <div>On Monday, October 30, at Apple’s Scary Fast special event unveiling the all-new MacBook Pro with the M3 family of chips and 24-inch iMac with M3, there was an unseen star of the show working behind the scenes. All of the presenters, locations, and drone footage in the event were filmed using iPhone 15 Pro Max, the preferred smartphone for creative pros and filmmakers. Led by documentary film director Brian Oakes, known for the award-winning <em>Jim: The James Foley Story </em>and<em> Living with Lincoln</em>, Scary Fast put iPhone 15 Pro Max right in the middle of the action.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>The iPhone 15 Pro Max camera system offers the best video in a smartphone, with its quality rivaling those of professional video cameras. iPhone 15 Pro Max enables creatives to capture in ProRes up to 4K60 fps to an external drive with Apple Log encoding, which allows even more detail to be preserved for post-production color grading. iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max are also the first smartphones in the world to support the Academy Color Encoding System (ACES), a global standard for color workflows.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>“We were able to get the same complex shots with iPhone 15 Pro Max,” says Oakes. “It’s amazing to see that the quality from a device that is so small and so portable can rival a large $20,000 camera.”
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>The production was advised by Apple’s Jon Carr, a Pro Workflow video specialist whose credits include <em>Top Gun: Maverick</em> and <em>Terminator: Dark Fate</em>, and Jeff Wozniak, who has worked on productions including <em>Transformers: Dark of the Moon</em>, <em>Avatar</em>, and <em>Iron Man 2</em>. “This year, iPhone 15 Pro Max was supercharged with the ability to record ProRes to an external drive, and Apple Log, our flavor of a format that all of the very high-end digital cameras shoot,” says Wozniak.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>“It’s pretty amazing how you can put this in the hands of someone who’s a professional director and they don’t have to change their equipment — they don’t have to change any of the things that they always do,” adds Carr.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>Capturing footage with multiple iPhone 15 Pro Max devices, the team utilized the integration between iPhone 15 Pro, the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/blackmagic-camera/id6449580241" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-analytics-exit-link="">Blackmagic Camera</a> app, and Tentacle Sync, showcasing the true power of the Apple ecosystem. Connected via Bluetooth, Tentacle Sync drives timecode and enables all devices on set — including Macs and preview screens — to be synced throughout the production. Beastgrip accessories, including cages and rigs, were also used during the production. &nbsp;

                 <div>Here’s how Scary Fast came to life behind the scenes.

With ProRes Log encoding, iPhone 15 Pro Max has even more high and low light range than previous models, resulting overall in better dynamic range and better flexibility for color grading in post-production. “When I first got the footage from iPhone 15 Pro Max, I was immediately pleasantly surprised,” says Stefan Sonnenfeld, Company 3’s CEO, who colored the presentation and has worked on projects including <em>Stranger Things</em>, <em>The Equalizer 3</em>, and<em> Fast X</em>. “The quality of the image on iPhone 15 Pro Max is incredible, and it’s there. And I know because I’ve done it and I’ve seen it, and we’re doing this project with it.”

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-body-6841874513404372481" itemprop="description articleBody"><p>
Introduced in 1973, Ethernet is the predominant way of wiring computers together.
Chips were soon introduced to handle the low-level aspects of Ethernet: converting data packets into bits,
implementing checksums, and handling network collisions.
In 1982, Intel announced the i82586 Ethernet LAN coprocessor chip, which went much further by offloading most of the
data movement from the main processor to an on-chip coprocessor.
Modern Ethernet networks handle a gigabit of data per second or more, but at the time, the Intel chip's support for 10 Mb/s
Ethernet put it on the cutting edge.
(Ethernet was surprisingly expensive, about $2000 at the time, but <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=3kpkQKds0lAC&amp;lpg=PA4&amp;pg=PA4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">expected to drop</a> under $1000 with the Intel chip.)
In this blog post, I focus on a specific part of the coprocessor chip: how it handles network collisions and implements
exponential backoff.</p>
<p>The die photo below shows the i82586 chip. This photo shows the metal layer on top of the chip, which hides the underlying
polysilicon wiring and silicon transistors.
Around the edge of the chip, square bond pads provide the link to the chip's 48 external pins.
I have labeled the function blocks based on my reverse engineering and published descriptions. The left side of the chip is called the "receive unit" and
handles the low-level networking,
with circuitry for the network transmitter and receiver.
The left side also contains low-level control and status registers.
The right side is called the "command unit" and interfaces to memory and the main processor.
The right side contains a simple processor controlled by a microinstruction ROM.<span id="fnref:microcode"><a href="#fn:microcode">1</a></span>
Data is transmitted between the two halves of the chip by 16-byte FIFOs (first in, first out queues).</p>

Click this image (or any other) for a larger version.</p>
<p>The 82586 chip is more complex than the typical Ethernet chip at the time.
It was designed to improve system performance by moving most of the Ethernet processing from the main processor to
the coprocessor, allowing the main processor and the coprocessor to operate in parallel.
The coprocessor provides four DMA channels to move data between memory and the network without the main processor's involvement.
The main processor and the coprocessor communicate through complex data structures<span id="fnref:structures"><a href="#fn:structures">2</a></span> in shared memory: the main processor puts control blocks in memory
to tell the I/O coprocessor what to do, specifying the locations of transmit and receive buffers in memory.
In response, the I/O coprocessor puts status blocks in memory.
The processor onboard the 82586 chip allows the chip to handle these complex data structures in software.
Meanwhile, the transmission/receive circuitry on the left side of the chip uses dedicated circuitry to handle the low-level,
high-speed aspects of Ethernet. </p>
<h2>Ethernet and collisions</h2>
<p>A key problem with a shared network is how to prevent multiple computers from trying to send data on the network at the same
time.
Instead of a centralized control mechanism, Ethernet allows computers to transmit whenever they want.<span id="fnref:token-ring"><a href="#fn:token-ring">3</a></span>
If two computers transmit at the same time, the "collision" is detected and the computers try again, hoping to
avoid a collision the next time.
Although this may sound inefficient, it turns out to work out remarkably well.<span id="fnref:csma"><a href="#fn:csma">4</a></span>
To avoid a second collision, each computer waits a random amount of time before retransmitting the packet.
If a collision happens again (which is likely on a busy network), an exponential backoff algorithm is used, with each
computer waiting longer and longer after each collision.
This automatically balances the retransmission delay to minimize collisions and maximize throughput.</p>
<p>I traced out a bunch of circuitry to determine how the exponential backoff logic is implemented.
To summarize, exponential backoff is implemented with a 10-bit counter to provide a pseudorandom number, a 10-bit mask register to get an exponentially sized
delay, and a delay counter to count down the delay.
I'll discuss how these are implemented, starting with the 10-bit counter.</p>
<h2>The 10-bit counter</h2>
<p>A 10-bit counter may seem trivial, but it still takes up a substantial area of the chip.
The straightforward way of implementing a counter is to hook up 10 latches as a "ripple counter".
The counter is controlled by a clock signal that indicates that the counter should increment.
The clock toggles the lowest bit of the counter.
If this bit flips from 1 to 0, the next higher bit is toggled.
The process is repeated from bit to bit, toggling a bit if there is a carry.
The problem with this approach is that the carry "ripples" through the counter.
Each bit is delayed by the lower bit, so the bits don't all flip at the same time.
This limits the speed of the counter as the top bit isn't settled until the carry has propagated through the nine lower bits.</p>
<p>The counter in the chip uses a different approach with additional circuitry to improve performance.
Each bit has logic to check if all the lower bits are ones. If so, the clock signal toggles the bit.
All the bits toggle at the same time, rapidly incrementing the counter in response to the clock signals.
The drawback of this approach is that it requires much more logic.</p>
<p>The diagram below shows how the carry logic is implemented. 
The circuitry is optimized to balance speed and complexity.
In particular, bits are examined in groups of three, allowing some of the logic to be shared across multiple bits.
For instance, instead of using a 9-input gate to examine the nine lower bits, separate gates test bits 0-2 and 3-5.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/i82586s/toggle-logic.jpg"><img alt="The circuitry to generate the toggle signals for each bit of the counter." height="555" src="https://static.righto.com/images/i82586s/toggle-logic-w350.jpg" title="The circuitry to generate the toggle signals for each bit of the counter." width="350"></a></p><p>The circuitry to generate the toggle signals for each bit of the counter.</p>
<p>The implementation of the latches is also interesting. 
Each latch is implemented with dynamic logic, using the circuit's capacitance to store each bit.
The input is connected to the output with two inverters.
When the clock is high, the transistor turns on, connecting the inverters in a loop that holds the value.
When the clock is low, the transistor turns off. However, the 0 or 1 value will still remain on the input to
the first inverter, held by the charge on the transistor's gate. 
At this time, an input can be fed into the latch, overriding the old value.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/i82586s/bit.jpg"><img alt="The basic dynamic latch circuit." height="148" src="https://static.righto.com/images/i82586s/bit-w300.jpg" title="The basic dynamic latch circuit." width="300"></a></p><p>The basic dynamic latch circuit.</p>
<p>The latch has some additional circuitry to make it useful.
To toggle the latch, the output is inverted before feeding it back to the input. The toggle control signal selects
the inverted output through another pass transistor.
The toggle signal is only activated when the clock is low, ensuring that the
circuit doesn't repeatedly toggle, oscillating out of control.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/i82586s/counter-bit.jpg"><img alt="One bit of the counter." height="196" src="https://static.righto.com/images/i82586s/counter-bit-w400.jpg" title="One bit of the counter." width="400"></a></p><p>One bit of the counter.</p>
<p>The image below shows how the counter circuit is implemented on the die. I have removed the metal layer to show the underlying transistors; the circles are contacts where the metal was connected to the underlying silicon.
The pinkish regions are doped silicon. The pink-gray lines are polysilicon wiring. When polysilicon crosses doped silicon, it
creates a transistor.
The blue color swirls are not significant; they are bits of oxide remaining on the die.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/i82586s/die-counter.jpg"><img alt="The counter circuitry on the die." height="764" src="https://static.righto.com/images/i82586s/die-counter-w400.jpg" title="The counter circuitry on the die." width="400"></a></p><p>The counter circuitry on the die.</p>
<h2>The 10-bit mask register</h2>
<p>The mask register has a particular number of low bits set, providing a mask of length 0 to 10.
For instance, with 4 bits set, the mask register is 0000001111.
The mask register can be updated in two ways. First, it can be set to length 1-8 with a three-bit length input.<span id="fnref:length"><a href="#fn:length">5</a></span>
Second, the mask can be lengthened by one bit, for example going from 0000001111 to 0000011111 (length 4 to 5).</p>
<p>The mask register is implemented with dynamic latches similar to the counter, but the inputs to the latches are different.
To load the mask to a particular length, each bit has logic to determine if the bit should be set based on the three-bit input.
For example, bit 3 is cleared if the specified length is 0 to 3, and set otherwise.
The lengthening feature is implemented by shifting the mask value to the left by one bit and inserting a 1 into the lowest bit.</p>
<p>The schematic below shows one bit of the mask register. At the center is a two-inverter latch as seen before.
When the clock is high, it holds its value. When the clock is low, the latch can be loaded with a new value.
The "shift" line causes the bit from the previous stage to be shifted in. The "load" line loads the mask bit generated from
the input length. The "reset" line clears the mask.
At the right is the NAND gate that applies the mask to the count and inverts the result.
As will be seen below, these NAND gates are unusually large.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/i82586s/mask-stage.png"><img alt="One stage of the mask register." height="259" src="https://static.righto.com/images/i82586s/mask-stage-w500.png" title="One stage of the mask register." width="500"></a></p><p>One stage of the mask register.</p>
<p>The logic to set a mask bit based on the length input is shown below.<span id="fnref:demorgan"><a href="#fn:demorgan">6</a></span>
The three-bit "sel" input selects the mask length from 1 to 8 bits; note that the mask0 bit is always set while bits
8 and 9 are cleared.<span id="fnref:control"><a href="#fn:control">7</a></span>
Each set of gates energizes the corresponding mask line for the appropriate inputs.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/i82586s/mask-ctrl.png"><img alt="The control logic to enable mask bits based on length." height="602" src="https://static.righto.com/images/i82586s/mask-ctrl-w350.png" title="The control logic to enable mask bits based on length." width="350"></a></p><p>The control logic to enable mask bits based on length.</p>
<p>The diagram below shows the mask register on the die. I removed the metal layer to show the underlying
silicon and polysilicon, so the transistors are visible.
On the left are the NAND gates that combine each bit of the counter with the mask. Note that large snake-like
transistors; these larger transistors provide enough current to drive the signal over the long bus to
the delay counter register at the bottom of the chip.
Bit 0 of the mask is always set, so it doesn't have a latch. Bits 8 and 9 of the mask are only set by
shifting, not by selecting a mask length, so they don't have mask logic.<span id="fnref:state"><a href="#fn:state">8</a></span></p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/i82586s/mask-register.jpg"><img alt="The mask register on the die." height="764" src="https://static.righto.com/images/i82586s/mask-register-w400.jpg" title="The mask register on the die." width="400"></a></p><p>The mask register on the die.</p>
<h2>The delay counter register</h2>
<p>To generate the pseudorandom exponential backoff, the counter register and the mask register are NANDed together.
This generates a number of the desired binary length, which is stored in the delay counter.
Note that the NAND operation inverts the result, making it negative.
Thus, as the delay counter counts up, it counts toward zero, reaching zero after the desired number of clock ticks.</p>
<p>The implementation of the delay counter is similar to the first counter, so I won't include a schematic.
However, the delay counter is attached to the register bus, allowing its value to be read by the chip's CPU.
Control lines allow the delay counter's value to pass onto the register bus.</p>
<p>The diagram below shows the locations of the counter, mask, and delay register on the die.
In this era, something as simple as a 10-bit register occupied a significant part of the die.
Also note the distance between the counter and mask and the delay register at the bottom of the chip.
The NAND gates for the counter and mask required large transistors to drive the signal across this large distance.</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>The Intel Ethernet chip provides an interesting example of how a real-world circuit is implemented on a chip.
Exponential backoff is a key part of the Ethernet standard.
This chip implements backoff with a simple but optimized circuit.<span id="fnref:drawback"><a href="#fn:drawback">9</a></span></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-target="readme-toc.content">
            <article itemprop="text"><h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-microtcp" dir="auto"><a href="#microtcp">MicroTCP</a></h2>
<p dir="auto">MicroTCP is a TCP/IP network stack I started building as a learning exercise while attending the Computer Networking course at the Università degli Studi di Napoli Federico II. It's just a hobby project and is intended to just be a minimal, yet complete, implementation.</p>
<p dir="auto">At this moment MicroTCP implements ARP (RFC 826, complete), IPv4 (no fragmentation), ICMP (minimum necessary to reply to pings) and TCP (complete but not stress-tested). Note that "complete" should not be intended as "fully compliant" but just as a measure of progress on all of the major features. For instance, it's complete enough to handle HTTP traffic on a local network (Look into examples/microhttp to know more).</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-where-does-it-run" dir="auto"><a href="#where-does-it-run">Where does it run?</a></h2>
<p dir="auto">MicroTCP can run on Windows and Linux alongside the OS's network stack. To route the network traffic to MicroTCP, the process running it behaves as a virtual host with its own IP address. This is done using a TAP device, which comes built-in on Linux and needs to be installed on Windows. It should be very easy to adapt MicroTCP to run on microcontrollers but haven't tried yet. The dream is to serve my <a href="https://cozis.github.io/" rel="nofollow">blog</a> from an STM32 board!</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-build-and-install" dir="auto"><a href="#build-and-install">Build and Install</a></h2>
<p dir="auto">If you are on Windows, you need to install the TAP driver provided by OpenVPN and instanciate a virtual NIC so that MicroTCP can connect to it when started. To build the project from source, make sure you cloned the repository with submodules</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="git clone https://github.com/cozis/microtcp.git --recursive"><pre>git clone https://github.com/cozis/microtcp.git --recursive</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">and then run</p>

<p dir="auto">You'll need both <code>make</code> and <code>cmake</code> for it to work. If all goes well, you'll find the library files <code>libtuntap.a</code>, <code>libmicrotcp.a</code> and header files <code>tuntap.h</code>, <code>tuntap-export.h</code>, <code>microtcp.h</code> in <code>out/</code>.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-usage" dir="auto"><a href="#usage">Usage</a></h2>
<p dir="auto">MicroTCP's uses the usual socket interface any network programmer is familiar with, the main difference being you need to explicitly instanciate the network stack and pass its handle around.</p>
<p dir="auto">Here's a simple echo server that shows the basic usage:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="#include <microtcp.h>

int main(void)
{
    microtcp_t *mtcp = microtcp_create();
    
    uint16_t port = 80;
    microtcp_socket_t *server = microtcp_open(mtcp, port, NULL);
    
    while (1) {

        microtcp_socket_t *client = microtcp_accept(server, false, NULL);

        char buffer[1024];
        size_t num = microtcp_recv(client, buffer, sizeof(buffer), NULL);
        microtcp_send(client, &quot;echo: &quot;, 6, NULL);
        microtcp_send(client, buffer, num, NULL);

        microtcp_close(client);
    }
    
    microtcp_close(server);
    microtcp_destroy(mtcp);
    return 0;
}

<p dir="auto">This should be pretty straight forward to understand. One thing may be worth noting is that <code>microtcp_open</code> behaves as the BSD's <code>socket+bind+listen</code> all at once to setup a listening TCP server.</p>
<p dir="auto">There is more than one way to set up the stack, the main way being <code>microtcp_create</code> which creates a virtual network inferface on the host OS with IP 10.0.0.5/24 and a virtual host for the MicroTCP process at 10.0.0.4/24. You can open Wireshark on the virtual NIC to inspect the traffic between the host and the process.</p>
<p dir="auto">It's also possible to configure the stack using the <code>microtcp_create_using_callbacks</code>, which lets you explicitly provide the input L2 frames to it and receive the frames in a buffer. This is how one would configure the stack to run on a microcontroller.</p>
<p dir="auto">Each instance of MicroTCP (without considering the callbacks) is completely isolated from the others, therefore, if your specific callback implementation allows it, you can have as many instances as you like!</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-testing" dir="auto"><a href="#testing">Testing</a></h2>
<p dir="auto">There is still no testing infractructure. The way I'm testing it is by setting up an HTTP or echo server and stressing it until something breaks while capturing what happened using Wireshark.</p>

<p dir="auto">Getting started consists of two steps:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li><strong>Installing</strong> the server, console and their dependencies</li>
<li><strong>Instrumenting</strong> your code with one of our <a href="https://docs.streamdal.com/sdks" rel="nofollow">SDKs</a></li>
</ol>
<h3 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-install" dir="auto"><a href="#install">Install</a></h3>
<p dir="auto">The <em>easiest</em> way to get Streamdal running is via <code>curl | bash</code>:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="curl -sSL https://sh.streamdal.com | bash"><pre><code>curl -sSL https://sh.streamdal.com | bash
</code></pre></div>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>The install script will verify that you have <code>git</code>, <code>docker</code> and <code>docker-compose</code> installed</li>
<li>The install script will clone this repo to <code>~/streamdal</code></li>
<li>The install script will bring up all components via <code>docker-compose</code></li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">Once done:</p>
<p dir="auto">🎉 <strong>Open<code>http://localhost:8080</code> in your browser!</strong> 🎉</p>
<p dir="auto">You should be presented with a <em>beautiful</em> (but empty) UI! To populate it,
we will need to instrument some code. <em>Onto the next section!</em></p>

<h3 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-instrument" dir="auto"><a href="#instrument">Instrument</a></h3>
<p dir="auto">Once you've installed the server and console, you can instrument your code using

<li><strong><a href="https://docs.streamdal.com/en/core-components/sdk/" rel="nofollow">SDKs</a></strong></li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">The basic flow is that you <a href="#getting-started">install</a> the server and console and
wrap any reads or writes in your app with our SDK. Once that's done, you will be

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p id="region-abstract">
<h2>If you work from home in California, your employer might be required to contribute to your internet bill, electricity bill, and other expenses necessary to do your job.</h2>
</p><div id="region-content">
<p><a href="https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/legal-issues-to-consider-when-transitioning-to-a-remote-workforce.html">Remote work</a> has well-recognized benefits (no commute) and drawbacks (disappearing boundaries between personal and professional life), but one little-commented side effect of the "WFH" lifestyle is the cost associated with being at home throughout the work week.</p>
<p>From skyrocketing utility payments to additional costs for phone and internet use, many remote workers are now shouldering the expenses that their employers used to pay. But are employees really responsible for expenses incurred while working from home?</p>
<p>In California, at least, the answer is no. California is one of about <a href="https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/can-employees-get-reimbursed-for-work-at-home-expenses-incurred-due-to-covid-19.html">two dozen states with laws requiring employer reimbursement</a> of employee work expenses—and one of only a few states to make clear that those laws apply to remote work. (Cal. Lab. Code § 2802 (2022).)</p>
<p>In fact, 2022 saw a <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2022-04-07/covid-work-from-home-lawsuits-pandemic-business-expenses-litigation" rel="noopener" target="_blank">spate of California lawsuits</a> by remote workers demanding reimbursement from large employers such as Amazon, Visa, and Bank of America for work-from-home expenses incurred during the pandemic.</p>
<p>As these lawsuits continue to make their way through the courts, the question for California workers remains: Which of your WFH expenses must be reimbursed by your employer?</p>
<h2>California Employers Must Reimburse You for Any "Necessary" Expenses</h2>
<p>Under California law, your employer must reimburse you for any "necessary" expenses incurred while you're working from home.</p>
<h3>What Are "Necessary" Expenses?</h3>
<p>Expenses are considered "necessary" if they're required for you to do your job. This is true whether you're working in the office (or other worksite) or working remotely.</p>
<p>For example, if your job involves scientific research, then it might be necessary for you to pay for a subscription to an online science journal; your employer would have to reimburse you for that expense. If, on the other hand, you feel you are a more effective leader if you stay abreast of developing news, but doing so is not part of your job duties, then subscriptions to various newspapers are not "necessary" for you to do your job and would not be reimbursable.</p>
<p>California courts have also found that when it comes to monthly expenses such as cell phone or internet bills, "necessary" expenses generally include a "reasonable percentage" of such costs.</p>
<p>For example, one court found that when an employee had to use his personal cell phone to make work calls, his employer was required to reimburse him for a portion of his phone bill even though the employee did not incur any additional expenses because he had an unlimited data plan. The court found that any other interpretation would result in an unfair windfall to the employer.</p>
<p>While the determination of whether an expense is "necessary" varies depending on the circumstances of a particular case, generally speaking, California employees who <a href="https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/workplace-surveillance-while-working-from-home.html">work from home</a> are likely entitled to reimbursement for the following expenses:</p>
<ul>
<li>a reasonable percentage of their internet bill</li>
<li>a reasonable percentage of their mobile phone bill</li>
<li>a work computer, a printer, and other necessary equipment (however, home office equipment purchased by an employer likely belongs to the employer, and must be returned if the employee leaves the company)</li>
<li>necessary online subscriptions, such as a paid plan for remote meeting software</li>
<li>travel expenses, and</li>
<li>attorney fees incurred to recover expenses.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although the law regarding these expenses is not yet decided, remote California workers <em>may</em> also be entitled to reimbursement for:</p>
<ul>
<li>a reasonable percentage of electricity costs, and</li>
<li>the cost of dedicated home office space (reimbursement is more likely if the employee was renting or had plans to rent the space to a third party prior to beginning remote work). (Cal. Lab. Code § 2802 (2022).)</li>
</ul>
<h3>What If You're Working From Home Voluntarily?</h3>
<p>Employers and courts are more likely to find that expenses incurred while working from home are "necessary" if remote work is required or encouraged by your employer.</p>
<p>However, if your organization has returned to in-person work, but you choose to work from home, it's less likely that your business expenses will be seen as "necessary"—as you could have avoided them by working from the office or other worksite.</p>
<h2>You're Entitled to Reimbursement If Your Employer Knew or Should Have Known About the Expenses</h2>
<p>While many employers require you to submit expense reports or other paperwork in order to be reimbursed, California courts have held that reimbursement requests aren't necessary if your employer has reason to know about the expenses you're incurring.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://casetext.com/case/williams-v-amazoncom-servs" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Williams v. Amazon</em></a>, a high-profile case arising from the pandemic, a California software development engineer alleged that Amazon failed to properly reimburse its employees for expenses incurred while they were working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic (2022).</p>
<p>Amazon filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiff's lawsuit, arguing that it didn't have to reimburse its employee's expenses because he hadn't submitted reimbursement requests.</p>
<p>But in June 2022, the court denied Amazon's motion to dismiss, finding that Amazon knew or should have known that its employees who work from home incurred basic costs related to remote work—including expenses related to internet, electricity, and physical space.</p>
<p>In overruling Amazon's motion to dismiss, the court found that the lawsuit could move forward, although it has not yet decided the ultimate question of whether Amazon must actually reimburse employees for their WFH expenses.</p>
<h2>Contact an Employment Attorney</h2>
<p>If your employer has failed to reimburse you for expenses you incurred while working from home, consider raising the issue with your employer. Because many companies are still adjusting to the "new normal" of remote work, they might be unaware of their legal obligation to reimburse employees for necessary expenses. For that reason, it might be helpful to refer your employer to the <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=2802.&amp;lawCode=LAB" rel="noopener" target="_blank">relevant law</a>. </p>
<p>If your employer refuses to meet its legal requirements, it might be worth contacting an employment attorney to discuss your legal options.</p>

The islands are tiny, too, with a total land area of 56 km²; about half the size of Walt Disney World Resort in Florida.</p><figure><img src="https://www.beep.blog/content/images/2023/06/annotely_image-4.png" alt="A map of the Indian Ocean with the Chagos Archipelago highlighted in the centre." loading="lazy" width="1475" height="1201" srcset="https://www.beep.blog/content/images/size/w600/2023/06/annotely_image-4.png 600w, https://www.beep.blog/content/images/size/w1000/2023/06/annotely_image-4.png 1000w, https://www.beep.blog/content/images/2023/06/annotely_image-4.png 1475w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>The Chagos Archipelago. Image copyright © OpenStreetMap.</figcaption></figure><p>But despite the archipelago's size and isolation, it was home -- for a time -- to a thriving community.</p><h2 id="a-short-history-lesson">A short history lesson</h2><p>The first Europeans to stake a claim to the Chagos Archipelago were the French. They settled the nearby <em>Isle de France</em> in 1715. By 1793, a French coconut plantation housed the first permanent settlement on the archipelago's largest island, <em>Diego Garcia</em>.</p><p>This being an 18th Century European settlement, <em>of course</em> it was built on the backs of slaves. The colony was French, but <a href="https://www.refworld.org/docid/49749ce6c.html?ref=beep.blog">the people were Malagasy and Mozambican</a>.</p><p>After Napoleon's defeat in 1814, <a href="http://www.govmu.org/English/ExploreMauritius/Pages/History.aspx?ref=beep.blog#british">the French ceded <em>Isle de France</em> and its dependencies to Britain</a>. Britain reinstated the isle's Dutch name – <em>Mauritius</em> – and continued to govern the archipelago and its plantations from there.</p><p>After the abolition of slavery in 1835, many now-freemen chose to stay on the archipelago and were joined by labourers from India. Beautiful people being beautiful people, they were fruitful and multiplied. New families made the archipelago their home, and <a href="http://www.chagosislandersmovement.com/ourhistory/?ref=beep.blog">an integrated Chagossian society blossomed for generations</a>. By the 1960's, the archipelago was home to some 2,000 people. </p><p>In the incredible documentary "<a href="https://vimeo.com/17401157?ref=beep.blog">Stealing a Nation</a>", journalist John Pilger asked <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlesia_Alexis?ref=beep.blog">Charlesia Alexis</a> about her fondest memories of Diego Garcia: </p><blockquote>"We could eat and drink everything, we never lacked for anything. And we never bought anything, except for the clothes we wore."</blockquote><p>In that same documentary, Rita Élysée Bancoult reminisced:</p><blockquote>"I had dogs which I brought to the beach with me. At low tide they would go out and catch fish and bring them in and lay them at my feet."</blockquote><p>While the islanders relied on their governing island Mauritius for trade and medical treatment, they were largely and comfortably self-sufficient. Life was, by their own accounts, good.</p><h2 id="conspiracy">Conspiracy</h2><p>The end of World War II in 1945 led to the start of the Cold War. Soviet influence grew across Europe and Asia, and the United States of America sought to expand too. </p><p>And she had just the spot in mind.</p><p>No matter where in the world the next inevitable war was to break out, those idyllic coral islands smack in the centre of the Indian Ocean would be <a href="https://warontherocks.com/2020/06/americas-interest-in-diego-garcia/?ref=beep.blog">the perfect staging platform</a> for attacks against a dozen countries' supply lines, communication hubs and military targets.</p><p>But how could the United States acquire the archipelago? The land was Mauritian territory, and – even though Mauritius was a British territory -- Britain had no claim over the islands. No matter what the United States' offered her war-time ally, the land wasn't legally Britain's to trade.</p><p>And so, Britain traded the land <em>illegally</em>.</p><p>On November 8th, 1965, the British Foreign Office redrew the map. Public servants in London created, on paper, a new British territory -- the <strong><a href="https://biot.gov.io/?ref=beep.blog">British Indian Ocean Territory</a></strong> &nbsp;-- which encompassed the Chagos Archipelago, then transferred governance of the islands from Mauritius directly to London.</p><p>By the Foreign Office's reckoning, the islands were now British. And in exchange for a $14 million discount on a nuclear missile, the British Indian Ocean Territory was leased to the United States of America.</p><p>But what about the Chagossian people living on those islands?</p><h2 id="terror">Terror</h2><p>The American military-industrial complex was not amenable to sharing the islands.</p><p>The people were removed; first by terror, then deceit, then force.</p><p>Robin Mardemootoo, lawyer for the Chagos Islanders, explained the opening strike against the people:</p><blockquote>The British and American authorities implemented a policy decision that was aimed at depriving that community -- in the Chagos -- from basic supplies. No milk, no dairy products, no oil, no sugar, no salt, no medication, no more of the things you use in life.</blockquote><p>When the blockade didn't scare enough Chagossians away, Sir Bruce Greatbatch -- <em>Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order, Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George, Member of the Order of the British Empire, Governor of the Seychelles and interim administrator of the British Indian Ocean Territory</em> -- ordered all the dogs on Diego Garcia to be killed.</p><p>Almost a thousand pets and hunting animals were rounded up and gassed with the exhaust fumes of American military vehicles. The people were threatened with the same if they didn't leave.</p><p>When terror didn't work, Britain resorted to deceit. Islanders who left the archipelago were denied return. Many, like Charlesia Alexis, had no idea when travelling to Mauritius for medical treatment that they'd never see their homes again.</p><p>And finally, when terror and deceit hadn't been enough, the islanders were removed by force.</p><h2 id="exile">Exile</h2><p>At 1pm on <a href="https://shipstamps.co.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?t=6422&amp;ref=beep.blog">October 15th, 1971</a>, the remaining people of Diego Garcia were summoned to the office of Sir Greatbatch's magistrate, John Rawling Todd. They were told they were to be loaded onto the cargo ship <em>MV Nordvær</em> and immediately expelled from their homeland. </p><p>They were allowed one suitcase each. Anything of cultural, emotional or financial value that they couldn't carry had to be abandoned. Sir Greatbatch demanded that the horses ride on-deck, while each family was permitted one mattress and forced to sleep on the ship's cargo of bird shit.</p><p>In an instant, not having bank accounts or currency of significant value, the Chagossians were poverty-stricken; no farms, no ocean to fish, no money, no homes.</p><p>The <em>Nordvær</em> sailed to the Seychelles, where the Chagossians were marched uphill to a prison and held until passage to Port Louis, Mauritius, was arranged. Then, at Port Louis, they were dumped and abandoned on the docks.</p><p>Cassam Uteem, former President of Mauritius, recalls:</p><blockquote>Some of them stayed on the docks, waiting for the next ship to take them back home. There was never to be a ship to take them back home.</blockquote><p>Eventually, they were taken to the derelict <em>Estate Beau Marchand</em> housing estate. They were given no water, no electricity, no doors, and no windows.</p><p>Many of the islanders died; of poverty and -- in their own words -- of "sadness".</p><p>Of heartbreak, despair, and suicide.</p><p>Those who lived couldn't afford to pay for funerals.</p><p>By the end of 1975, the expulsion and exile of the Chagossian people was complete. A survey showed 26 families had died together in poverty. Young girls were forced into prostitution to survive. 9 people committed suicide. And Mauritanian slums are still prisons to Chagossians today.</p><p>This was nothing less than ethnic cleansing.</p><h3 id="the-war-machine">The war machine</h3><p>Today, the archipelago's two-thousand Chagossians have been replaced by two-thousand military personnel.</p><p><em><a href="https://cnrj.cnic.navy.mil/Installations/NSF-Diego-Garcia/?ref=beep.blog">Naval Support Facility Diego Garcia</a></em> is owned by the British Ministry of Defence, leased to the United States Navy, and operated together.</p><p>"One Island, One Team, One Mission," they say.</p><p>Nearly 4 km of Diego was paved into a <a href="https://www.naval-technology.com/projects/diego-garcia/?ref=beep.blog">runway</a> where American bombers have launched attacks on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraqi_invasion_of_Kuwait?ref=beep.blog">Iraq</a> and Afghanistan. There are piers and warehouses to support aircraft, ships and submarines. The island even hosts a satellite tracking station code-named "<a href="https://wikimapia.org/6799412/Diego-Garcia-Tracking-Station-REEF?ref=beep.blog">REEF</a>". </p><p>How the fuck did they get away with this?</p><h2 id="they-knew-it-was-illegal">They knew it was illegal</h2><p>From the very beginning of the conspiracy to expel the Chagossians, the British and United States authorities knew it was illegal.</p><p>They anticipated several challenges, two of which were:</p><ol><li>The detachment of colonial territory.</li><li>The United Nation's "sacred trust".</li></ol><p>First, the detachment of colonial territory. <a href="https://undocs.org/A/Res/1514(XV)?ref=beep.blog">United Nations Resolution 1514 (XV)</a> states that:</p><blockquote>[...] any attempt aimed at the partial or total disruption of the national unity and the territorial integrity of a country is incompatible with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations.</blockquote><p>In other words, in the opinion of the United Nations General Assembly and recorded in <a href="https://undocs.org/en/A/RES/2066(XX)?ref=beep.blog">Resolution 2066</a> in 1965, Britain broke international law when she detached the Chagos Archipelago from Mauritanian territory and reassigned it to British Indian Ocean Territory. </p><p>Mauritius did not, at the time, have independent legislative or executive power. Without the power of free and genuine expression, <a href="https://www.un.org/press/en/2019/ga12146.doc.htm?ref=beep.blog">the consent of the people could not have been queried or known</a>.</p><h2 id="sacred-trust">Sacred Trust</h2><p>The second legal challenge concerned the United Nations' "sacred trust".</p><p><a href="https://www.un.org/en/about-us/un-charter/chapter-11?ref=beep.blog">Chapter XI of the UN Charter</a> requires member states to recognise that "the interests of the inhabitants of [their] territories are paramount" and to accept a "<a href="https://www.un.org/en/observances/non-self-governing-week?ref=beep.blog">sacred trust</a>" to promote their peoples' well-being.</p><p>It goes without saying, the forced expulsion of the British citizens of the Chagos Islands from their homelands into abject poverty <em>utterly</em> violated international law.</p><p>Britain's defence was to claim -- to <em>lie</em> -- that the Chagos Archipelago was uninhabited when it was transferred into British Indian Ocean Territory administration. Now that British Foreign Office memoranda of the time are on the public record, we can see the lie for ourselves.</p><p>Foreign Office memorandum, July 1965, records:</p><blockquote>People were born there, and in some cases their parents were born there too. The intention is, however, that none of them should be regarded as being permanent inhabitants of the islands. [...] The legal position of the inhabitants would be greatly simplified from our point of view, though not necessarily from theirs, if we decided to treat them as a floating population.</blockquote><p>By "floating population", the Foreign Office meant to convince the world that the Chagossians were contract workers temporarily living on the island for employment, with no claim that the islands are their homeland.</p><p>Another Foreign Office memorandum, in November 1965, reinforced the lie and Britain's lack of concern for UN condemnation:</p><blockquote>There is a civilian population. In practice, however, I would advice a policy of "quiet disregard" -- in other words, let's forget about this one until the United Nations challenge us on it.</blockquote><h2 id="they-tried">They tried</h2><p>The United Nations -- and others -- <em>did</em> challenge Britain. Repeatedly.</p><p>In 2019, the International Court of Justice ruled that <a href="https://www.un.org/press/en/2019/ga12146.doc.htm?ref=beep.blog">the UK's occupation of the Chagos Islands is unlawful</a>. The UN passed <a href="https://digitallibrary.un.org/record/3802539?ref=beep.blog">Resolution A/73/L.84</a> to demand that the United Kingdom unconditionally withdraw its administration from the area within six months </p><p>In 2000, the United Kingdom's own High Court ruled that <a href="https://www.equaltimes.org/will-the-uk-ever-let-chagos?ref=beep.blog#.YVrVbPco_d4">Britain should allow the Chagossians to return home</a>.</p><p>In 2021, <a href="https://www.itlos.org/en/main/cases/list-of-cases/dispute-concerning-delimitation-of-the-maritime-boundary-between-mauritius-and-maldives-in-the-indian-ocean-mauritius/maldives/?ref=beep.blog">Case #28</a> of <em>the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea</em> <a href="https://www.un.org/Depts/los/clcs_new/submissions_files/preliminary/mus_2021_preliminaryinfo.pdf?ref=beep.blog">ruled</a>: </p><blockquote>[...] it is inconceivable that the United Kingdom, whose administration over the Chagos Archipelago constitutes a wrongful act of a continuing character and thus must be brought to an end as rapidly as possible, and yet who has failed to do so, can have any legal interests in permanently disposing of maritime zones around the Chagos Archipelago by delimitation.</blockquote><p>And:</p><blockquote>It follows that, despite the United Kingdom's ongoing and unlawful colonial administration of the Chagos Archipelago, there can be no doubt that the Chagos Archipelago forms an integral part of the territory of the Republic of Mauritius and that there is no dispute with the United Kingdom as regards sovereignty over the Chagos Archipelago.</blockquote><h2 id="it-never-ends">It never ends</h2><p>So, with all these rulings, what was Britain to do?</p><p>Terminate the United States' lease on the islands and tear down the base?</p><p>What do <em>you</em> think?</p><p>Britain's response was to designate the territory a nature reserve -- <a href="https://www.zsl.org/regions/uk-overseas-territories/chagos-archipelago?ref=beep.blog"><em>the Chagos Marine Protected Area</em></a> -- to be protected from human habitation.</p><p>But now, is it really fair of me to imply that the creation of the <em>Chagos Marine Protected Area</em> was just a disgusting ploy to prevent the Chagossians returning home? Couldn't it just be a rare and genuine political effort to save a natural environment?</p><p>We <em>could</em> believe that, if not for Wikileaks.</p><p>On May 15th, 2009, a <a href="https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/09LONDON1156_a.html?ref=beep.blog">cable</a> intercepted from Britain described the then-proposed reserve:</p><blockquote>[Her Majesty's Government] would like to establish a "marine park" or "reserve" providing comprehensive environmental protection to the reefs and waters of the British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT), a senior Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) official informed Polcouns on May 12. [...]<p>He said that the BIOT's former inhabitants would find it difficult, if not impossible, to pursue their claim for resettlement on the islands if the entire Chagos Archipelago were a marine reserve.</p></blockquote><p>Colin Roberts, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office Director of Overseas Territories, is quoted:</p><blockquote>[...] according to [Her Majesty's Government's] current thinking on a reserve, there would be "no human footprints" or "Man Fridays" on the BIOT's uninhabited islands. He asserted that establishing a marine park would, in effect, put paid to resettlement claims of the archipelago's former residents.<p>Responding to Polcouns' observation that the advocates of Chagossian resettlement continue to vigorously press their case, Roberts opined that the UK's "environmental lobby is far more powerful than the Chagossians' advocates."</p></blockquote><p>And if the Foreign and Commonwealth Office's disdain for the Chagossian people wasn't obvious enough:</p><blockquote>Roberts emphasized. "We do not regret the removal of the population," since removal was necessary for the BIOT to fulfill its strategic purpose, he said. Removal of the population is the reason that the BIOT's uninhabited islands and the surrounding waters are in "pristine" condition.</blockquote><p>The cable ends with:</p><blockquote>Establishing a marine reserve might, indeed, as the FCO's Roberts stated, be the most effective long-term way to prevent any of the Chagos Islands' former inhabitants or their descendants from resettling in the BIOT.</blockquote><p>Angry, yet? Let's start talking about what you can do. Or, stop doing.</p><p>The <em><a href="https://www.iso.org/?ref=beep.blog">International Organization for Standardization</a></em> (ISO) is an international, non-governmental organisation that develops and describes shared understandings of our world. </p><p>Standard <em>ISO 9660</em>, for example, describes the structure of CD-ROM disks. <em>ISO 8601</em> describes date and time representation. And since 1974, <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166?ref=beep.blog#Editions">ISO 3166</a></em> has described an ever-growing set of two-character codes to represent the countries and territories of the world.</p><p>The United States of America, for example, was assigned <code>"US"</code>. Britain got <code>"GB"</code>. And the British Indian Ocean Territory was given <code><a href="https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/?ref=beep.blog#iso:code:3166:IO">"IO"</a></code>. </p><p>In March 1994, the Internet was young but growing fast. There were only seven top-level domains available back then -- <code>.com</code>, <code>.org</code>. <code>.net</code>, <code>.int</code>, <code>.edu</code>, <code>.gov</code> and <code>.mil</code> -- and the webizens of the information superhighway hungered for more variety.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1591.txt?ref=beep.blog">RFC 1591</a>, Jon Postel proposed the addition of <em>country code</em> top-level domains, which would use ISO 3166 as a basis and would allow governments to use and monetise as they wished.</p><p>The proposal came to pass. The United States of America was given the power to sell and profit from <code>".us"</code> domains. Britain was given <code>".uk"</code> domains. And she got her stolen territory's <code>".io"</code> domains, too.</p><p>And so, finally, I reach my point.</p><p>Every <code>.io</code> domain you buy funds a government committing <a href="https://www.scottishlegal.com/article/edinburgh-meeting-hears-britain-s-refusal-to-allow-chagos-islanders-to-return-home-is-crime-against-humanity?ref=beep.blog">crimes against humanity</a>. Every <code>.io</code> domain you renew legitimises and reinforces the continued exile of the Chagossians.</p><h2 id="what-happens-now">What happens now?</h2><p>I've got nothing but sympathy for folks who bought a <code>.io</code> domain in good faith before they learned about the criminality behind it.</p><p>In fact, in a way, the last thing I want is to tarnish the <code>.io</code> domain.</p><p>There's a lot to be done before this wrong has been righted, but a part of that has <em>got</em> to be the redirection of profits from <code>.io</code> sales and renewals from the British government to the Chagossian people. And then, if the Chagossian people are amenable to global sales of <code>.io</code> domains, for the name to enjoy a second renaissance and financially support the right people.</p><p>My dreams are naive, sure.</p><p>For my part, I'm working on migrating all my email from <code>@cariad.io</code> to <code>@cariad.earth</code>. It's a pain, but it's worth it.</p><p>If you're able to, I implore you to stop buying and renewing <code>.io</code> domains. Next time you're asked to vote, find out how your candidates feel about the exile of the Chagossians. Read what <a href="https://thechagosrefugeesgroup.com/?ref=beep.blog">The Chagos Refugees Group</a> has to say.</p><p>And for fuck's sake, look out for your fellow human beings.</p>

<p>Windows 11 users can now <a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/98830-windows-finally-adds-native-support-rar-files.html">manage RAR archives natively</a>, with no need for third-party software or questionable archive "unpackers." Windows 11 22H2, the past year's last major release of the operating system (distributed on September 20, 2022), will soon become even more proficient in managing different kinds of archive files and formats.</p>
<p>Microsoft recently released <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/october-26-2023-kb5031455-os-build-22621-2506-preview-6513c5ec-c5a2-4aaf-97f5-44c13d29e0d4">KB5031455</a>, an optional, feature-rich preview cumulative update for Windows 11, refreshing the list of archive formats natively supported in the OS. Windows 11 22H2 and later versions can now manage files compressed in the following archive types: .rar, .7z, .tar, .tar.gz, .tar.bz2, .tar.zst, .tar.xz, .tgz, .tbz2, .tzst, .txz. Support for password-encrypted archives is not available yet.</p>
<p>Redmond programmers added support for the aforementioned archive files thanks to the <a href="https://github.com/libarchive/libarchive">libarchive library</a>, an open source project designed to develop a portable, efficient C library that can "read and write streaming archives" in a variety of formats. Libarchive supports additional archive types (Lzh, Xar) that could eventually come to Windows 11 as well.</p>

<p>Being an optional, non-mandatory update, the KB5031455 patch needs to be installed manually by going through the Windows Update settings page on Windows 11 and searching for newly released updates. If everything goes well with "early testers," the update's contents should eventually come to the majority of Windows users through the next batch of cumulative patches scheduled for November's 2023 Patch Tuesday.</p>
<p>The ability to support additional archive types (besides RAR and Zip) was hinted at by Panos Panay, who talked about the upcoming feature in one of his <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2023/05/23/bringing-the-power-of-ai-to-windows-11-unlocking-a-new-era-of-productivity-for-customers-and-developers-with-windows-copilot-and-dev-home/">Build blog posts</a> before he departed Microsoft. Windows 11 users can now get improved performance of archive functionality during compression, Panay said in May 2023.</p>
<p>Extended file type support is part of the Moment 4 package, a new feature update for Windows 11 that provides 72 new features and improvements to the cloud/AI-centric OS. KB5031455 features include the "centralized AI assistance" for Windows known as Copilot, an overhauled File Explorer "experience," a new Microsoft Backup app, a built-in Passkey Manager, and much more. Meanwhile, Windows 10 users can keep using trustworthy third-party archive managers like WinRAR for the foreseeable future.</p>

<em>WordStar 4.0</em></p><p>As old as it seems, George R.R. Martin used it to write “A Song of Ice and Fire”.</p><p>Why would someone use such an old piece of software to write over 5,000 pages? I love how he puts it:</p><blockquote>It does everything I want a word processing program to do and it doesn't do anything else. I don't want any help. I hate some of these modern systems where you type up a lowercase letter and it becomes a capital. I don't want a capital, if I'd wanted a capital, I would have typed the capital.<cite><a href="#rf1">George R.R. Martin</a></cite></blockquote><p>This program embodies the concept of finished software — a software you can use forever with no unneeded changes.</p><p>Finished software is software that’s not expected to change, and that’s a feature! You can rely on it to do some real work.</p><p>Once you get used to the software, once the software works for you, you don’t need to learn anything new; the interface will exactly be the same, and all your files will stay relevant. No migrations, no new payments, no new changes.</p><p>This kind of software can be created intentionally, with a compromise from the creators that they won’t bother you with things you don’t need, and only the absolutely necessary will change, like minor updates to make it compatible with new operating systems.</p><p>Sometimes, finished software happens accidentally; maybe the company behind it has disappeared, or the product has been abandoned.</p><p>There are also some great examples in the UNIX world of finished software: commands like <code>cd</code>(to change the current directory) or <code>ls</code>(to list what’s there) won’t ever change in a significant way. You can rely on them until the end of your career.</p><h2 id="the-seduction-of-constant-updates">The seduction of constant updates</h2><p>Our expectations for software are different from other products we use in our daily lives.</p><p>When we buy a physical product, we accept that it won’t change in its lifetime. We’ll use it until it wears off, and we replace it. We can rely on that product not evolving; the gas pedal in my car will always be in the same place.</p><p>However, when it comes to software, we usually have the ingrained expectations of perpetual updates. We believe that if software doesn’t evolve it’ll be boring, old and unusable. If we see an app with no updates in the last year, we think the creator might be dead.</p><p>We also expect new versions of any software will be better than the previous ones. Once it’s released, most of our problems will be solved! What a deceiving lie.</p><p>Sometimes, a software upgrade is a step backward: less usable, less stable, with new bugs. Even if it’s genuinely better, there’s the learning curve. You were efficient with the old version, but now your most used button is on the other side of the screen under a hidden menu.</p><h2 id="finished-software-is-a-good-reminder">Finished software is a good reminder</h2><p>In a world where constant change is the norm, finished software provides a breath of fresh air. It’s a reminder that reliability, consistency, and user satisfaction can coexist in the realm of software development.</p><p>So the next time you find yourself yearning for the latest update, remember that sometimes, the best software is the one that doesn’t change at all.</p><hr><h3 id="references">References</h3><p><span id="rf1">[1] George R.R.

<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-introduction" dir="auto"><a href="#introduction"></a><a id="user-content-1"></a>Introduction</h2>
<p dir="auto">Usually, our applications operate with the current state of a domain object.
But sometimes, we need to know the entire history of the domain object changes.
For example, we want to know how an order got into its current state.</p>
<p dir="auto">The audit trail (also called the audit log) is a chronological record of the history
and details of the actions that affected the system.
An audit trail may be a regulatory or business requirement.</p>
<p dir="auto">We can store all changes to the domain object state as a sequence of events in an append-only event stream.
Thus, event streams will contain an entire history of changes.
But how can we be sure that this history is authentic and error-free?
We can use event streams as a primary source of truth in a system.
To get the current state of an object, we have to replay all events in the order of occurrence.
This pattern is called event sourcing. The database for storing event streams is called an event store.
Event sourcing provides a complete and accurate record of all changes made to a system.
Event sourcing is an industry standard for implementing audit trail.</p>
<p dir="auto">There are specialized databases for event sourcing.
Developer Advocates working for the companies behind these specialized databases said
you shouldn't implement event sourcing with traditional relational or document-oriented databases.
Is this true or just a marketing ploy?</p>
<p dir="auto">Specialized databases for event sourcing are convenient and provide the necessary functionality out of the box.
But PostgreSQL, the world's most advanced open-source database, is also suitable for event sourcing.
You can use PostgreSQL as an event store without additional frameworks or extensions
instead of setting up and maintaining a separate specialized database for event sourcing.</p>
<p dir="auto">This repository provides a reference implementation of an event-sourced system
that uses PostgreSQL as an event store built with Spring Boot.
<a href="https://github.com/eugene-khyst/postgresql-event-sourcing/fork">Fork</a> the repository and use it as a template for your projects.
Or clone the repository and run end-to-end tests to see how everything works together.</p>

<h3 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-state-oriented-persistence" dir="auto"><a href="#state-oriented-persistence"></a><a id="user-content-3-1"></a>State-oriented persistence</h3>
<p dir="auto">State-oriented persistence (CRUD) applications store only the latest version of an entity.
Database records present entities.
When an entity is updated, the corresponding database record gets updated too.
SQL <code>INSERT</code>, <code>UPDATE</code> and <code>DELETE</code> statements are used.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/eugene-khyst/postgresql-event-sourcing/blob/main/img/state-oriented-persistence.svg"><img src="https://github.com/eugene-khyst/postgresql-event-sourcing/raw/main/img/state-oriented-persistence.svg" alt="State-oriented persistence"></a></p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-event-sourcing" dir="auto"><a href="#event-sourcing"></a><a id="user-content-3-2"></a>Event sourcing</h3>
<p dir="auto">Event sourcing applications persist the state of an entity as a sequence of immutable state-changing events.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/eugene-khyst/postgresql-event-sourcing/blob/main/img/event-sourcing-1.svg"><img src="https://github.com/eugene-khyst/postgresql-event-sourcing/raw/main/img/event-sourcing-1.svg" alt="Event sourcing"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Whenever the state of an entity changes, a new event is appended to the list of events.
Only SQL <code>INSERT</code> statements are used.
Events are immutables, so SQL <code>UPDATE</code> and <code>DELETE</code> statements are not used.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/eugene-khyst/postgresql-event-sourcing/blob/main/img/event-sourcing-2.svg"><img src="https://github.com/eugene-khyst/postgresql-event-sourcing/raw/main/img/event-sourcing-2.svg" alt="Event sourcing"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The current state of an entity can be restored by replaying all its events.</p>
<p dir="auto">Event sourcing is closely related to domain-driven design (DDD) and shares some terminology.</p>
<p dir="auto">An entity in event sourcing is called an <strong>aggregate</strong>.</p>
<p dir="auto">A sequence of events for the same aggregate is called a <strong>stream</strong>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Event sourcing is best suited for short-living entities with a small total number of
events (e.g., orders).</p>
<p dir="auto">Restoring the state of the short-living entity by replaying all its events doesn't have any
performance impact. Thus, no optimizations for restoring state are required for short-living
entities.</p>
<p dir="auto">For endlessly stored entities (e.g., users, bank accounts) with thousands of events restoring state
by replaying all events is not optimal, and snapshotting should be considered.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-snapshotting" dir="auto"><a href="#snapshotting"></a><a id="user-content-3-3"></a>Snapshotting</h3>
<p dir="auto">Snapshotting is an optimization technique where a snapshot of the aggregate's state is also saved,
so an application can restore the current state of the aggregate from the snapshot rather than from
all the events (potentially thousands).</p>
<p dir="auto">On every <em>nth</em> event, make an aggregate snapshot by storing an aggregate state and its version.</p>
<p dir="auto">To restore an aggregate state:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>first read the latest snapshot,</li>
<li>then read events forward from the original stream starting from the version pointed by the snapshot.</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/eugene-khyst/postgresql-event-sourcing/blob/main/img/event-sourcing-snapshotting.svg"><img src="https://github.com/eugene-khyst/postgresql-event-sourcing/raw/main/img/event-sourcing-snapshotting.svg" alt="Snapshotting in event souring"></a></p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-querying-the-data" dir="auto"><a href="#querying-the-data"></a><a id="user-content-3-4"></a>Querying the data</h3>
<p dir="auto">It's easy to find an aggregate by ID, but other queries are difficult.
Since aggregates are stored as append-only lists of immutable events,
querying the data using SQL, as we used to, is impossible.
To find an aggregate by some field, we need to first read all the events and replay them to restore all the aggregates.</p>
<p dir="auto">To bring back all the querying power a relational database has to offer,
we can create a dedicated read model derived from the event stream.</p>
<p dir="auto">The event stream is the write model and the primary source of truth.</p>
<p dir="auto">The read model is a "denormalized" view of the write model, allowing faster and more convenient querying.
Read models are projections of the system state.
Therefore, read models are also known as <strong>projections</strong>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Projections provide a view of data for a single aggregate type
or perform aggregations and combine data from multiple aggregate types.</p>
<p dir="auto">That's where CQRS comes in handy.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-cqrs" dir="auto"><a href="#cqrs"></a><a id="user-content-3-5"></a>CQRS</h3>
<p dir="auto">Command-query responsibility segregation (CQRS) stands for segregating the responsibility between
commands (write requests) and queries (read requests).
The write requests and the read requests are processed by different handlers.</p>
<p dir="auto">A command generates zero or more events or results in an error.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/eugene-khyst/postgresql-event-sourcing/blob/main/img/cqrs-1.svg"><img src="https://github.com/eugene-khyst/postgresql-event-sourcing/raw/main/img/cqrs-1.svg" alt="CQRS"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">CQRS is a self-sufficient architectural pattern and doesn't require event sourcing.
But in practice, event sourcing is usually used in conjunction with CQRS.
Event store is used as a write database, and SQL or NoSQL database as a read database.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/eugene-khyst/postgresql-event-sourcing/blob/main/img/cqrs-2.svg"><img src="https://github.com/eugene-khyst/postgresql-event-sourcing/raw/main/img/cqrs-2.svg" alt="CQRS with event sourcing"></a></p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-event-handlers" dir="auto"><a href="#event-handlers"></a><a id="user-content-3-6"></a>Event handlers</h3>
<p dir="auto">Commands generate events.
Event processing is done by <strong>event handlers</strong>.
As a part of event processing, we may need to update projections,
send a message to a message broker, or make an API call.</p>
<p dir="auto">There are two types of event handlers: <strong>synchronous</strong> and <strong>asynchronous</strong>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Storing the write model and read model in the same database allows for transactional updates of the read model.
Each time we append a new event, the projection is updated <strong>synchronously</strong> in the same transaction.
The projection is <strong>consistent</strong> with the event stream.</p>
<p dir="auto">When an event handler communicates with an external system or middleware (e.g., sends a message to Kafka),
it should run <strong>asynchronously</strong> after the transaction updating the write model.
Asynchronous execution leads to <strong>eventual consistency</strong>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Communication with external systems should not occur in the same transaction updating the write model.
The external system call may succeed, but the transaction will later be rolled back, resulting in an inconsistency.</p>
<p dir="auto">Anyway, distributed systems should be designed with eventual consistency in mind.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-domain-events-vs-integration-events" dir="auto"><a href="#domain-events-vs-integration-events"></a><a id="user-content-3-7"></a>Domain events vs Integration events</h3>
<p dir="auto">Events in event sourcing are <strong>domain events</strong>.
The domain event is a part of a bounded context and should not be used "as-is" for integration with other bounded
contexts.</p>
<p dir="auto">For communication between bounded contexts <strong>integration events</strong> are used.
The integration event represents the current state of an aggregate, not just changes to the aggregate as a domain event.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-advantages-of-cqrs" dir="auto"><a href="#advantages-of-cqrs"></a><a id="user-content-3-8"></a>Advantages of CQRS</h3>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Independent scaling of the read and write databases.</li>
<li>Optimized data schema for the read database (e.g. the read databases can be denormalized).</li>
<li>Simpler queries (e.g. complex <code>JOIN</code> operations can be avoided).</li>
</ul>
<h3 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-advantages-of-event-sourcing" dir="auto"><a href="#advantages-of-event-sourcing"></a><a id="user-content-3-9"></a>Advantages of event sourcing</h3>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>A true history of the system (audit and traceability).
An industry standard for implementing audit trail.</li>
<li>Ability to put the system in any prior state (e.g. for debugging).</li>
<li>New read-side projections can be created as needed (later) from events.
It allows responding to future needs and new requirements.</li>
</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-solution-architecture" dir="auto"><a href="#solution-architecture"></a><a id="user-content-4"></a>Solution architecture</h2>
<p dir="auto">PostgreSQL can be used as an event store.

<p dir="auto">Using PostgreSQL as an event store and a read database allows for transactional updates of the read model.
Each time we append a new event, the projection is updated synchronously in the same transaction.
It's a big advantage because sometimes consistency is not so easy to achieve.</p>
<p dir="auto">You can't get consistent projections when a separate database is used as an event store.</p>

<p dir="auto">Integration events should be sent asynchronously after the transaction updating the write model.</p>
<p dir="auto">PostgreSQL doesn't allow subscribing on changes, so the solution is a Transactional Outbox pattern.
A service that uses a database inserts events into an outbox table as part of the local transaction.
A separate process publishes the events inserted into database to a message broker.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/eugene-khyst/postgresql-event-sourcing/blob/main/img/transactional-outbox-1.svg"><img src="https://github.com/eugene-khyst/postgresql-event-sourcing/raw/main/img/transactional-outbox-1.svg" alt="Transactional outbox pattern"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">We may have multiple asynchronous event handlers or so-called subscriptions.
The subscription concept is required to keep track of delivered events separately for different event handlers.
The last event processed by the event handler (subscription) is stored in the separate table <code>ES_EVENT_SUBSCRIPTION</code>.
New events are processed by polling the <code>ES_EVENT</code> table.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/eugene-khyst/postgresql-event-sourcing/blob/main/img/transactional-outbox-2.svg"><img src="https://github.com/eugene-khyst/postgresql-event-sourcing/raw/main/img/transactional-outbox-2.svg" alt="Transactional outbox pattern with subscriptions"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Since multiple instances of this application can run in parallel,
we need to ensure that any processing only affects the event once.
We don't want more than one event handler instance to handle the same event.</p>
<p dir="auto">This is achieved by acquiring locks on the rows of the <code>ES_EVENT_SUBSCRIPTION</code> table.
We lock the row (<code>SELECT FOR UPDATE</code>) of the currently processed subscription.</p>
<p dir="auto">To not hang other backend instances, we want to skip already locked rows (<code>SELECT FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED</code>)
and lock the "next" subscription.
It allows multiple backend instances to select different subscriptions that do not overlap.
This way, we improve availability and scalability.</p>
<p dir="auto">The event subscription processor polls <code>ES_EVENT_SUBSCRIPTION</code> table every second (interval is configurable) for new events
and processes them:</p>

Even if the transaction is not yet committed, the new sequence value becomes visible to other transactions.</p>

<p dir="auto">We use transaction ID with event ID to build a reliable PostgreSQL polling mechanism that doesn't lose events.</p>
<p dir="auto">Each event is supplemented with the current transaction ID.

<code>xid8</code> values increase strictly monotonically and cannot be reused in the lifetime of a database cluster.</p>

All transaction IDs less than <code>xmin</code> are either committed and visible, or rolled back.</p>

<h4 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-database-polling" dir="auto"><a href="#database-polling"></a><a id="user-content-4-7-2"></a>Database polling</h4>
<p dir="auto">To get new events from the <code>ES_EVENT</code> table, the application has to poll the database.
The shorter the polling period, the shorter the delay between persisting a new event and processing it by the subscription.
But the lag is inevitable. If the polling period is 1 second, then the lag is at most 1 second.</p>
<p dir="auto">The polling mechanism implementation <a href="https://github.com/eugene-khyst/postgresql-event-sourcing/blob/main/src/main/java/com/example/eventsourcing/service/ScheduledEventSubscriptionProcessor.java">ScheduledEventSubscriptionProcessor</a>

<h4 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-database-polling-alternative" dir="auto"><a href="#database-polling-alternative"></a><a id="user-content-4-7-3"></a>Database polling alternative</h4>
<p dir="auto">To reduce the lag associated with database polling, the polling period can be set to a very low value,
such as 1 second.
But this means that there will be 3600 database queries per hour and 86400 per day, even if there are no new events.</p>
<p dir="auto">PostgreSQL <code>LISTEN</code> and <code>NOTIFY</code> feature can be used instead of polling.
This mechanism allows for sending asynchronous notifications across database connections.
Notifications are not sent directly from the application,
but via the database <a href="https://github.com/eugene-khyst/postgresql-event-sourcing/blob/main/src/main/resources/db/migration/V2__notify_trigger.sql">trigger</a> on a table.</p>
<p dir="auto">To use this functionality an unshared <a href="https://jdbc.postgresql.org/documentation/publicapi/org/postgresql/jdbc/PgConnection.html" rel="nofollow">PgConnection</a>
which remains open is required.
The long-lived dedicated JDBC <code>Connection</code> for receiving notifications has to be created using the <code>DriverManager</code> API,
instead of getting from a pooled <code>DataSource</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">PostgreSQL JDBC driver can't receive asynchronous notifications
and must poll the backend to check if any notifications were issued.
A timeout can be given to the poll function <code>getNotifications(int timeoutMillis)</code>,
but then the execution of statements from other threads will block.
When <code>timeoutMillis</code> = 0, blocks forever or until at least one notification has been received.
It means that notification is delivered almost immediately, without a lag.
If more than one notification is about to be received, these will be returned in one batch.</p>
<p dir="auto">This solution  significantly reduces the number of issued queries
and also solves the lag problem that the polling solution suffers from.</p>

<h3 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-drawbacks" dir="auto"><a href="#drawbacks"></a><a id="user-content-4-9"></a>Drawbacks</h3>
<p dir="auto">Using PostgreSQL as an event store has a lot of advantages, but there are also drawbacks.</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li><strong>Asynchronous event handlers can process the same event more than once.</strong>
It might crash after processing an event but before recording the fact that it has done so.
When it restarts, it will then process the same event again (e.g., send an integration event).
Integration events are delivered with <strong>at-least-once</strong> delivery guarantee.
The exactly-once delivery guarantee is hard to achieve due to a dual-write.
A dual-write describes a situation when you need to atomically update the database and publish messages
without two-phase commit (2PC).
Consumers of integration events should be idempotent and filter duplicates and unordered events.</li>
<li>The asynchronous event handling results in the <strong>eventual consistency between the write model and sent integration events</strong>.
The polling database table for new events with a fixed delay introduces a full consistency lag
greater than or equal to the interval between polls (1 second by default).</li>
<li><strong>A long-running transaction in the same database will effectively "pause" all event handlers.</strong>
<code>pg_snapshot_xmin(pg_snapshot)</code> will return the ID of this long-running transaction
and events created by all later transactions will be read by the event subscription processor
only after this long-running transaction is committed.</li>

      <p>AV1 is the next-gen open-source royalty-free video codec created by the Alliance for Open Media (AOM), a group founded by Google, Mozilla, Cisco, Microsoft, Netflix, Amazon, and Intel. Apple is also a member.</p>
<p>We are finally seeing more hardware support for this codec. The new <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/10/apple-unveils-m3-m3-pro-and-m3-max-the-most-advanced-chips-for-a-personal-computer/">M3 chips</a> from Apple support AV1 decode. The <a href="https://bitmovin.com/apple-av1-support/">iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max</a> also feature an AV1 hardware decoder.</p>
<p>The official <a href="https://source.android.com/docs/compatibility/14/android-14-cdd#:~:text=H%2D0%2D3%5D-,AV1,-End%20new%20requirements">Android 14 Compatibility Definition</a> makes support for AV1 mandatory.

<p><img alt="LINUX STORAGE" src="https://www.phoronix.com/assets/categories/linuxstorage.webp" width="100" height="100"></p><p>
Less than twenty-four hours after <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/Bcachefs-Tries-For-Linux-6.7">Bcachefs was submitted for Linux 6.7</a>, this new open-source file-system has been successfully merged for this next kernel version.
</p><p>
Given the past struggles to get <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/search/Bcachefs">Bcachefs</a> mainlined, I certainly didn't expect to see Linus Torvalds act so soon on merging it. But after it spent all of the 6.6 cycle within Linux-Next, overnight Linus Torvalds did in fact land this new file-system developed by Kent Overstreet.
</p><p><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=2023&amp;image=bcachefs_merged" alt="Bcachefs merged"></p>
<p>It's <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=9e87705289667a6c5185c619ea32f3d39314eb1b">merged</a> and I'll be running some fresh Bcachefs file-system benchmarks soon on Phoronix. Keep in mind though this file-system is initially considered experimental.</p></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.vzbv.de/urteile/gericht-untersagt-datenschutzverstoesse-von-linkedin">https://www.vzbv.de/urteile/gericht-untersagt-datenschutzverstoesse-von-linkedin</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38081633">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>Das soziale Netzwerk LinkedIn darf auf seiner Webseite nicht mehr mitteilen, dass es auf „Do-Not-Track“-Signale nicht reagiert, mit denen </strong><strong>Nutzer:innen</strong><strong> der Nachverfolgung („Tracking“) ihres Surfverhaltens per Browsereinstellung widersprechen. Das hat das Landgericht Berlin nach einer Klage des Verbraucherzentrale Bundesverbands (vzbv) entschieden. Das Gericht untersagte dem Unternehmen außerdem eine Voreinstellung, nach der das Profil des Mitglieds auch auf anderen Webseiten und Anwendungen sichtbar ist. Bereits im vergangenen Jahr hatte das Gericht den ungebetenen Versand von E-Mails an Nichtmitglieder untersagt.</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>„Wenn Verbraucher:innen die ,Do-Not-Track‘-Funktion ihres Browsers aktivieren, ist das eine klare Botschaft: Sie wollen nicht, dass ihr Surfverhalten für Werbe- und andere Zwecke ausgespäht wird“, sagt Rosemarie Rodden, Rechtsreferenin beim vzbv. „Webseitenbetreiber müssen dieses Signal respektieren.“</p>

<p>Widerspruch gegen Tracking ignoriert&nbsp;</p>

<p>Internetsurfer:innen können über ihren Browser einstellen, dass die besuchten Webseiten ein „Do-Not-Track“ (DNT)-Signal erhalten. Es übermittelt ihren Wunsch, dass die Online-Aktivitäten nicht nachverfolgt und ausgewertet werden. LinkedIn hatte auf seiner Internetseite mitgeteilt, dass es auf solche DNT-Signale nicht reagiert. Somit können auch gegen den Willen der Nutzer:innen personenbezogene Daten wie die IP-Adresse und Informationen über die Nutzung der Webseite etwa für Analyse- und Marketingzwecke ausgewertet werden, auch von Drittanbietern.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Das Landgericht Berlin schloss sich der Auffassung des vzbv an, dass die Mitteilung des Unternehmens irreführend war. Sie suggeriere, dass die Benutzung des DNT-Signals rechtlich irrelevant sei und die Beklagte ein solches Signal nicht zu beachten brauche. Das treffe nicht zu. Das Widerspruchsrecht gegen die Verarbeitung persönlicher Daten könne nach der Datenschutzgrundverordnung auch per automatisierten Verfahren ausgeübt werden. Ein DNT-Signal stelle einen wirksamen Widerspruch dar.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Einen weiteren Antrag in diesem Zusammenhang lehnte das Gericht aus prozessualen Gründen ab.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Profil ohne erforderliche Einwilligung veröffentlicht&nbsp;</p>

<p>In allen weiteren Punkten war die vzbv-Klage ohne Einschränkung erfolgreich. Das Gericht untersagte LinkedIn, bei der erstmaligen Anmeldung die Funktion „Sichtbarkeit des Profils“ zu aktivieren. Durch diese Voreinstellung war das persönliche LinkedIn-Profil ohne Zustimmung auch für Nicht-Mitglieder sowie außerhalb des Netzwerkes – etwa auf Suchmaschinen – öffentlich sichtbar. Die Richter:innen stellten klar, dass ein von vornherein aktivierter Schalter nicht die Anforderungen an eine wirksame Einwilligung in die Veröffentlichung personenbezogener Daten erfüllt. „Nutzerprofile dürfen nicht automatisch öffentlich einsehbar sein, wenn sie angelegt werden“, so Rosemarie Rodden.</p>

<p>Ungebetener E-Mail-Versand verboten&nbsp;</p>

<p>Einem Teil der Klage hatte das LG Berlin bereits im vergangenen Jahr stattgegeben. So ist es LinkedIn inzwischen verboten, E-Mail-Einladungen an Verbraucher:innen zu versenden, die nicht Mitglied des Netzwerks sind und die der Verwendung ihrer E-Mail-Adresse nicht zugestimmt haben. Außerdem untersagte das Gericht in einem weiteren Teil-Anerkenntnisurteil die Verwendung mehrerer Bestimmungen in den Geschäftsbedingungen des Unternehmens, darunter Klauseln, nach denen nur die englische Vertragsfassung verbindlich sein soll und ein Rechtsstreit nur im irischen Dublin ausgetragen werden darf.</p>

The 65W chip also wields a Radeon Vega iGPU with seven compute units clocked up to 1.9 GHz. Remember that APUs don't have dedicated memory but share system memory. You can determine the amount of memory inside the motherboard’s BIOS. In this case, the Redditor had 32GB of DDR4 and allocated 16GB to the Ryzen 5 4600G. Typically, 16GB is the maximum amount of memory you can dedicate to the iGPU. However, some user reports claim that certain ASRock AMD motherboards allow for higher memory allocation, rumored up to 64GB.</p><p>The trick converts the Ryzen 5 4600G into a 16GB "graphics card," flaunting more memory than some of Nvidia's latest <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/features/nvidia-ada-lovelace-and-geforce-rtx-40-series-everything-we-know" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/features/nvidia-ada-lovelace-and-geforce-rtx-40-series-everything-we-know">GeForce RTX 40-series</a> SKUs, such as the <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-review" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-review">GeForce RTX 4070</a> or <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-ti-review-a-costly-70-class-gpu" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-ti-review-a-costly-70-class-gpu">GeForce RTX 4070 Ti</a>, which are limited to 12GB. Logically, the APU doesn't deliver the same performance as a high-end graphics card, but at least it won't run out of memory during AI workloads, as 16GB is plenty for non-serious tasks.</p><p>AMD's <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/amd-to-expand-rocm-support-to-pro-and-consumer-rdna-3-gpus-this-fall" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/amd-to-expand-rocm-support-to-pro-and-consumer-rdna-3-gpus-this-fall">Radeon Open Compute platform</a> (ROCm) doesn't officially support Ryzen APUs. Third-party companies, such as BruhnBruhn Holding, offer experimental packages of ROCm that'll work with APUs. That means APUs can work with PyTorch and TensorFlow frameworks, opening the gate to most AI software. We wonder if AMD's latest mobile Ryzen chips, like Phoenix that taps into DDR5 memory, can work and what kind of performance they bring.</p><p>The Redditor shared a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPO7fu7Vyw4" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPO7fu7Vyw4">YouTube video</a> claiming that the Ryzen 5 4600G could run a plethora of AI applications, including Stable Diffusion, FastChat, MiniGPT-4, Alpaca-LoRA, Whisper, LLM, and LLaMA. Unfortunately, he only provided demos for Stable Diffusion, an AI image generator based on text input. He doesn't detail how he got the Ryzen 5 4600G to work with the AI software on his Linux system. The YouTuber has vouched to release a thorough video of the setup process.&nbsp;</p><p>As for the performance, the Ryzen 5 4600G only took around one minute and 50 seconds to generate a 512 x 512-pixel image with the default setting of 50 steps. It's an excellent result for a $95 APU and rivals some high-end processors. The author said he used DDR4 memory but didn't list the specifications. Although the Ryzen 5 4600G natively supports DDR4-3200, many samples can hit DDR4-4000, so it would be fascinating to see AI performance scaling with faster memory.</p><p>The experiment is fantastic for those who own a Ryzen 5 4600G or Ryzen 5 5600G and want to play around with AI. For those who don't, throwing $500 into an APU build doesn't make much sense when you can probably get a discrete graphics card that offers better performance. For instance, AMD's <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/amd-brags-about-cheaper-16gb-gpus" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/amd-brags-about-cheaper-16gb-gpus">Radeon 16GB graphics cards</a> start at $499, and Nvidia recently launched the <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4060-ti-16gb-review" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4060-ti-16gb-review">GeForce RTX 4060 Ti 16GB</a>, which has a similar starting price.</p>
