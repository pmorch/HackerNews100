Not necessarily SaaS click-and-drool tools for corporate drones, but unique and opinionated products that have some significant engineering innovation inside. Those companies have essentially no ability to attract talent organically, anyone interested in FANG would turn up their noses, and their number one problem is quality people. In many cases the CEO/CTO leadership is incredibly strong and smart; the colleagues are happy, motivated, intelligent, and disciplined; and the work/life balance is good for the middle aged. They're vital to their customers but under continuous competitive pressure so it is far from a snoozy place to serve out time - it's a mission and a struggle every day, things change often, the pace is fast. It can be very rewarding and compensation is decent. The tradeoff is the big exit is vanishingly unlikely.</p><p>Second idea is go into consulting/professional services. Not Accenture or anything horrible like that, but dozens of boutique/smaller firms with decently inspiring leadership and a very high standard of colleague. Work is variable in interest and environment, pressures are somewhat unfairly around whether you are billable or not which is not really in your control as an engineer.</p></div></td></tr>

                  <p>My longest employment stint was at such a company and it was a very good experience for me. That said, even though I worked at such a company for a while, I don't have a very good idea how I would go about identifying other such companies with open roles. Any suggestions on how to do that?</p>

I'm now working at a small- to mid-sized (~80 people) local B2B company. Pay is fine, they offer 100% WFH if you want, but they also have nice offices, they make good and stable revenue with reasonable growth targets, the actual work is somewhere between interesting and mind-numbingly stupid (e.g. integrating with poorly documented enterprise software - can be fun, but can also be aggravating), people are mostly happy.</p><p>There is a focus on delivering for clients rather than following processes.</p><p>I have about an hour of required meetings a week, 15-30 minutes technical meetings where people bring up any tech roadblocks or things where they need help, and a 20-45 minute sprint planning meeting. There's one monthly "show cool stuff" meeting for the whole company where everybody can voluntarily show something interesting they made. The rest of the time, I'm writing code, documentation, helping coworkers, talking to clients, stuff like that.</p><p>There is very high trust, e.g. people make honest effort estimates and there's no punishment or bad feedback if they're missed. There's a wide variety of skills because it's hard to attract top performers. This makes it easy to get hired (they immediately invited me for an interview after I sent them my CV, and made an offer after talking to me for 30 minutes), and it also means there's a culture of helping people and being patient and understanding when people are making an honest effort, but don't quite get things on the first try.</p><p>I'm working eight hours a day, five days a week, and when I'm done with work for the day, I don't think about it until the next day. It's nice.</p></div></td></tr>

I found professional services a bit stressful for what the OP is saying.</p><p>But I also think it’s really personal. Since turning 40 I tried: moving into management at a ~100 dev company; IC at a big tech firm (first time I’d worked somewhere really big as a dev); and now I’m back to running tech side of things at a startup.</p><p>I don’t think I could have known in advance which of those was going to work for me. There were a lot of positives to the first two, even though I ultimately left. Turns out I actually do prefer a) small places and b) a mix of management and IC work. But I’m absolutely sure that’s not true for everyone.</p><p>OP might feel like they want something very different from running their own startup – I also felt pretty burnt out on that after 7 years of my own – but once they’ve had some time they might remember why they went that way in the first place!</p></div></td></tr>

                  <p>For me it was management.  I was an SDE who started caring more about the users of my code than about the code itself and that led me to a team lead position and that led to management at a small company and that led to management at a big company. I found I really like mentoring junior engineers and I'm a good sounding board for senior engineers.  I got to spend a lot of time saying variations on "Hey, let's not do that thing that won't work, let's do something easier that will work."  I also focused a lot more on my career and making money rather than most of my life which I spent focused on cool tech and that got me to a place where I could retire easily when the time was right.  Now I code for fun and I still chat with former colleagues from time to time and get to say things like "Yeah, but you know option B is the right choice so go do that."  None of it was clearly planned, all of it was stressful but in the end it sort of worked out.</p>

                  <p>I think you mostly only run the risk of pigeonholing yourself as a “startup person” if you jump on another startup. But startup people value startup experience, so as along as you enjoy startup work and are making solid contributions, I think you have a long career ahead, with the caveat that options to work in a bigger company may be diminishing. Even then, it’s not all that uncommon for big companies to try to bring in startup types to breathe some life into a stagnant culture. Not so much  FAANG but there are a lot of other big tech companies with good comp.</p>

This is obviously nonsense. There are a few ways to explain your number:</p><p>- the same unsuitable candidates apply many times. This is not so surprising: suitable candidates get jobs and so stop repeatedly applying</p><p>- perhaps many people can be hired for a single ‘open position’, eg perhaps one is ‘software engineer based at headquarters’</p><p>- if many applicants are from people who are grossly unsuitable, eg maybe you must demonstrate job applications to get some state unemployment assistance</p><p>- maybe Meta aren’t hiring much at the moment and so it is harder to get in than other companies that are hiring</p><p>- the number might be misremembered</p><p>The downside to applying is trivial so even if chances do seem low, it can still be reasonable to apply. I think the probabilities implied by the comment I’m replying to are so extreme that you should have some higher estimated success probability from also considering the chance that the comment above is misleading.</p><p>The thing one often sees about automated cv filtering systems is mostly widely-believed nonsense. It is a story that is told to job seekers to sell cv-optimisation services. That’s not to say automated filtering doesn’t exist – a simple case is filtering out candidates that were recently rejected – but I think even if a lot of people are filtered out, that doesn’t mean you will be.</p></div></td></tr>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Installation</h2><a id="user-content-installation" aria-label="Permalink: Installation" href="#installation"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">First you will need python3 and pip3.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ pip install mitmproxy2swagger

$ <span>cd</span> mitmproxy2swagger
$ docker build -t mitmproxy2swagger <span>.</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Then clone the repo and run <code>mitmproxy2swagger</code> as per examples below.</p>

<p dir="auto">To create a specification by inspecting HTTP traffic you will need to:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">Capture the traffic by using the mitmproxy tool. I personally recommend using mitmweb, which is a web interface built-in to mitmproxy.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ mitmweb

<p dir="auto"><strong>IMPORTANT</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">To configure your client to use the proxy exposed by mitm proxy, please consult the <a href="https://docs.mitmproxy.org/stable/" rel="nofollow">mitmproxy documentation</a> for more information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Save the traffic to a flow file.</p>
<p dir="auto">In mitmweb you can do this by using the "File" menu and selecting "Save":</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/alufers/mitmproxy2swagger/blob/master/docs/mitmweb_save.png"><img src="https://github.com/alufers/mitmproxy2swagger/raw/master/docs/mitmweb_save.png" alt="A screenshot showing the location of the &quot;Save&quot; option in the &quot;File&quot; menu"></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Run the first pass of mitmproxy2swagger:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ mitmproxy2swagger -i <path_to_mitmptoxy_flow> -o <path_to_output_schema> -p <api_prefix>
# ... or ...
$ docker run -it -v $PWD:/app mitmproxy2swagger mitmproxy2swagger -i <path_to_mitmptoxy_flow> -o <path_to_output_schema> -p <api_prefix>"><pre>$ mitmproxy2swagger -i <span>&lt;</span>path_to_mitmptoxy_flow<span>&gt;</span> -o <span>&lt;</span>path_to_output_schema<span>&gt;</span> -p <span>&lt;</span>api_prefix<span>&gt;</span>
<span><span>#</span> ... or ...</span>
$ docker run -it -v <span>$PWD</span>:/app mitmproxy2swagger mitmproxy2swagger -i <span>&lt;</span>path_to_mitmptoxy_flow<span>&gt;</span> -o <span>&lt;</span>path_to_output_schema<span>&gt;</span> -p <span>&lt;</span>api_prefix<span>&gt;</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Please note that you can use an existing schema, in which case the existing schema will be extended with the new data. You can also run it a few times with different flow captures, the captured data will be safely merged.</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>&lt;api_prefix&gt;</code> is the base url of the API you wish to reverse-engineer. You will need to obtain it by observing the requests being made in mitmproxy.</p>
<p dir="auto">For example if an app has made requests like these:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="https://api.example.com/v1/login
https://api.example.com/v1/users/2
https://api.example.com/v1/users/2/profile"><pre><span>https://api.example.com/v1/login</span>
<span>https://api.example.com/v1/users/2</span>
<span>https://api.example.com/v1/users/2/profile</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">The likely prefix is <code>https://api.example.com/v1</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Running the first pass should have created a section in the schema file like this:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="x-path-templates:
  # Remove the ignore: prefix to generate an endpoint with its URL
  # Lines that are closer to the top take precedence, the matching is greedy
  - ignore:/addresses
  - ignore:/basket
  - ignore:/basket/add
  - ignore:/basket/checkouts
  - ignore:/basket/coupons/attach/{id}
  - ignore:/basket/coupons/attach/104754"><pre><span>x-path-templates</span>:
  <span><span>#</span> Remove the ignore: prefix to generate an endpoint with its URL</span>
  <span><span>#</span> Lines that are closer to the top take precedence, the matching is greedy</span>
  - <span>ignore:/addresses</span>
  - <span>ignore:/basket</span>
  - <span>ignore:/basket/add</span>
  - <span>ignore:/basket/checkouts</span>
  - <span>ignore:/basket/coupons/attach/{id}</span>
  - <span>ignore:/basket/coupons/attach/104754</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">You should edit the schema file with a text editor and remove the <code>ignore:</code> prefix from the paths you wish to be generated. You can also adjust the parameters appearing in the paths.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Run the second pass of mitmproxy2swagger:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ mitmproxy2swagger -i <path_to_mitmptoxy_flow> -o <path_to_output_schema> -p <api_prefix> [--examples]
# ... or ...
$ docker run -it -v $PWD:/app mitmproxy2swagger mitmproxy2swagger -i <path_to_mitmptoxy_flow> -o <path_to_output_schema> -p <api_prefix> [--examples]"><pre>$ mitmproxy2swagger -i <span>&lt;</span>path_to_mitmptoxy_flow<span>&gt;</span> -o <span>&lt;</span>path_to_output_schema<span>&gt;</span> -p <span>&lt;</span>api_prefix<span>&gt;</span> [--examples]
<span><span>#</span> ... or ...</span>
$ docker run -it -v <span>$PWD</span>:/app mitmproxy2swagger mitmproxy2swagger -i <span>&lt;</span>path_to_mitmptoxy_flow<span>&gt;</span> -o <span>&lt;</span>path_to_output_schema<span>&gt;</span> -p <span>&lt;</span>api_prefix<span>&gt;</span> [--examples]</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Run the command a second time (with the same schema file). It will pick up the edited lines and generate endpoint descriptions.</p>
<p dir="auto">Please note that mitmproxy2swagger will not overwrite existing endpoint descriptions, if you want to overwrite them, you can delete them before running the second pass.</p>
<p dir="auto">Passing <code>--examples</code> will add example data to requests and responses. Take caution when using this option, as it may add sensitive data (tokens, passwords, personal information etc.) to the schema.
Passing <code>--headers</code> will add headers data to requests and responses. Take caution when using this option, as it may add sensitive data (tokens, passwords, personal information etc.) to the schema.</p>

		<p>Happy Public Domain Day!</p>
		<p>Around the world, people celebrate Public Domain Day on January 1, the day in which copyright expires on some older works and they enter the public domain in many different countries.</p>
		<p>In the U.S. Constitution, copyright terms were meant to be very limited in order to “promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts.” The first copyright act, written in 1790 by the founding fathers themselves, set the term to be up to twenty-eight years.</p>
		<p>But since then, powerful corporations have repeatedly extended the length of copyright to promote not the progress of society, but their profit. The result is that today in the U.S., work only enters the public domain ninety-five years after publication—locking our culture away for <em>nearly a century</em>.</p>
		<p>2019 was the year in which new works were finally scheduled to enter the public domain, ending this long, corporate-dictated cultural winter. And as that year drew closer, it became clear that these corporations <em>wouldn’t</em> try to extend copyright yet again—making it the first year in almost a century in which a significant amount of art and literature once again entered the U.S. public domain, free for anyone in the U.S. to read, use, share, remix, build upon, and enjoy.</p>
		<p>Ever since then, we’ve been celebrating Public Domain Day by preparing some of the year’s biggest literary hits for you to read on January 1.</p>
		<hr>
		<p><strong>On January 1, 2025, books published in 1929 enter the U.S. public domain.</strong></p>
		<p>And 1929 was a literary doozy!</p>
		<p>Books by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/william-faulkner">William Faulkner</a>, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/ernest-hemingway">Ernest Hemingway</a>, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/mahatma-gandhi">Mahatma Gandhi</a>, and <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/john-steinbeck">John Steinbeck</a> enter the U.S. public domain. Joining these esteemed names is the English translation of <i><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/erich-maria-remarque/all-quiet-on-the-western-front/a-w-wheen">All Quiet on the Western Front</a></i>, the war novel so grisly that it was banned in parts of Europe; <i><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/dashiell-hammett/red-harvest">Red Harvest</a></i>, the first novel starring the <a href="https://standardebooks.org/collections/continental-op">Continental Op</a>, the hard-boiled noir detective who formed the archetype for every hard-drinking, fedora-wearing private eye to grace page and screen since; and much more.</p>
		<p>Our friends at the Public Domain Review have written about some <a href="https://publicdomainreview.org/blog/2025/01/public-domain-day-2025/">other things that enter the public domain this year, too</a>.</p>
		<p>These past few months at Standard Ebooks, our volunteers have been working hard to prepare a selection of the books published in 1929 in advance of Public Domain Day. We’re excited to finally be able to share these <strong>20 new free ebooks</strong> with you!</p>

							</h2>
							
							<p>Faulkner’s widely-acclaimed masterpiece is well-known in America, as it’s taught in high schools across the country. In it we follow the Compson family, an aristocratic family in Mississippi, and their slow decline into poverty and ruin. What makes the novel so special—and what lends it its reputation as a challenging read—is its stream-of-consciousness style, in which Faulkner attempts to narrate the characters’ thoughts directly to the reader.</p><p><i>The Sound and the Fury</i> was an essential step in developing that modernist prose style, and is still considered to be one of the greatest works of American literature.</p>

							<p>by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/erich-maria-remarque">Erich Maria Remarque</a></p>
							<p>One of the greatest war novels to come from any conflict, Erich Maria Remarque’s grisly tale of the brutality and horror of the German trenches during the Great War was so powerful that it earned him nominations for the Nobel Prizes in <em>both</em> Literature and Peace, and was soon widely banned in a Europe that was preparing for a second cataclysmic conflict.</p>

							</h2>
							<p>by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/ernest-hemingway">Ernest Hemingway</a></p>
							<p>Called “the premier American war novel from World War I,” Hemingway’s semi-autobiographical story of an American ambulance driver serving in the Italian front, and a bright and cynical British nurse, cemented his reputation as one of the generation’s foremost literary figures. Unlike Remarque, whose <i>All Quiet on the Western Front</i> paints the war’s destruction in full color, Hemingway’s story is one of the mundanity of war—of the quotidian smallness that underpins even the most horrific of events.</p>

							</h2>
							<p>by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/mahatma-gandhi">Mahatma Gandhi</a></p>
							<p>Mahatma Gandhi, father of the nation to post-colonial India, writes the story of his early life through 1921. He covers his childhood and his parents, his travels and his experiences with prejudice, how his interest in political activity and nonviolence developed throughout the years, and more. Despite this detailed treatment of his life, Gandhi asserts in the introduction that his purpose was not to write a “real autobiography,” but rather to “tell the story of my experiments with truth, and as my life consist of nothing but experiments.”</p>

							</h2>
							<p>by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/john-steinbeck">John Steinbeck</a></p>
							<p><i>Cup of Gold</i> is John Steinbeck’s first novel, the swashbuckling story of the real-life Captain Morgan, legendary pirate. Little of Morgan’s actual life is known, but Steinbeck fills in the blanks of this rich historical fiction with rich portraits of Caribbean ports and flourishes of magical realism.</p><p>While one might expect a rollicking tale of adventure, the novel is actually a deep meditation on the pursuit of—and inability to find—true happiness, and its skillful craft deftly foreshadows Steinbeck’s later ascension to literary titanhood.</p>

							<p>Samuel Dodsworth is a successful automobile executive who decides to retire early. His younger wife Fran wants to tour Europe, so the two embark on a trip. But soon after they arrive, Fran becomes enchanted by the whirlwind of culture and old-world society, while Samuel, a mild-mannered, down-to-earth Midwesterner, yearns to escape the pretentiousness and return to the quiet stability of home. The novel explores the slow breakdown of their marriage while deftly satirizing American middle-class mores and the wide gulf between them and European culture.</p>

							<p>by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/calvin-coolidge">Calvin Coolidge</a></p>
							<p>Calvin Coolidge was the 30th president of the United States, entering the office as vice president when president Warren G. Harding suddenly passed, and winning a reelection term. Even though he was hugely popular, he declined running for a second full term, opting to retire instead. In this autobiography—which is as brief as “Silent Cal’s” legend suggests it might be—we follow the former president from his idyllic boyhood in Vermont, to a career in the law, to the governorship of Massachusetts, to the presidency and beyond.</p>

							<p>Vance Weston is a young Midwestern man looking to make his way in the world of literature. He gets his chance when he visits some relatives in New York, caretakers of a house in the titular Hudson River Bracketed style.</p><p>Weston is a boy of little means; perhaps it’s this vast gulf between the character’s life and Edith Wharton’s own life that allowed her to feel more free to write in many semi-autobiographical details. In any case, she considered <i>Hudson River Bracketed</i> to be her finest novel, and went so far as to write a sequel in 1932.</p>

They decide to join forces and form the “Good Companions,” a musical act that takes them on a series of cozy adventures.</p>

							<p>While on operations in the Pacific during the first World War, the sailor Albert Brown’s ship is sunk—but he survives, and is taken on board the German cruiser that sank them. It too has suffered damage, and heads to some nearby islands for repairs. In this unlikely and hostile setting, Brown, alone, pits himself against the German ship and its crew, seeking to delay its progress while British naval reinforcements rush to his rescue.</p><p>Forester’s careful historical research adds an unimpeachable air of verisimilitude to the novel, and indeed, the plot is loosely based on real events.</p>

							</h2>
							<p>by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/john-buchan">John Buchan</a></p>
							<p><i>The Courts of the Morning</i> opens with <a href="https://standardebooks.org/collections/richard-hannay">Major-General Richard Hannay</a> being approached by American diplomats regarding the disappearance of a wealthy industrialist. He in turn seeks the help of his friend Sandy Arbuthnot—but Arbuthnot himself quickly goes missing. We soon head to the South American country of Olifa, where a powerful head of a mining company is gradually enslaving the populace. It seems that only guerrilla warfare will save the country from rule under a ruthless tyrant.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://dropbox.github.io/dbx-career-framework/">https://dropbox.github.io/dbx-career-framework/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42572515">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="doc-container">
<h2>What’s a Career Framework?</h2>
<p>The Engineering Career Framework is your source for how to achieve impact for your role and team and how to grow in your engineering career. For managers, it can help you set expectations with your teams and hold them accountable for their work.</p>
<h2>What the Career Framework is not</h2>
<p>This framework is not a promotion checklist for your role; rather, it’s designed to help you figure out what your impact could look like at the next level.</p>
<p>This framework is not an exhaustive list of examples and behaviors; each responsibility includes three to four key behaviors that serve as guide for how to think about your work. Consequently, you’ll need to meet with your manager to define your impact goals and align on the expectations for your role.</p>
<h2>What’s in a Career Framework?</h2>
<p>This framework is broken down into two components:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Level Expectations</strong> define the scope, collaborative reach, and levers for impact at every level; these expectations are the <em>what</em> that determines the difference between an IC3 and IC4, for example</li>
<li><strong>Core and Craft Responsibilities</strong> define the key behaviors specific to your role and team; these behaviors help you identify <em>how</em> you work to deliver impact based on your level expectations</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to navigate this framework</h2>
<p>Dropbox measures the success of its engineers largely on business impact. Anchor your work first and foremost on creating long-term impact. Since impact can be a bit vague, read <a href="https://dropbox.github.io/dbx-career-framework/what_is_impact.html">What is Impact?</a></p>
<p>Next, ground yourself in the expectations for your level and team. For each level, you’ll find a one-line summary description and the role’s scope, collaborative reach, and levers for impact.</p>
<p>Review the expected behaviors for that level across the Results, Direction, Talent, Culture pillars from the Core Responsibilities. Read your Craft expectations, which are the per discipline technical capabilities you need to master at that level. Finally, meet with your manager to set your goals for the quarter.</p>
<p>

<p dir="auto">Zasper is an IDE designed from the ground up to support massive concurrency. It provides a minimal memory footprint, exceptional speed, and the ability to handle numerous concurrent connections.</p>
<p dir="auto">It's perfectly suited for running REPL-style data applications, with Jupyter notebooks being one example.</p>
<p dir="auto">Currently Zasper is fully supported on Mac with limited support on Linux.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Benchmarks - 4X Better</h2><a id="user-content-benchmarks---4x-better" aria-label="Permalink: Benchmarks - 4X Better" href="#benchmarks---4x-better"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Zasper uses one fourth of RAM and one fourth of CPU used by Jupterlab. While Jupyterlab uses around 104.8 MB of RAM and 0.8 CPUs, Zasper uses 26.7 MB of RAM and 0.2 CPUs.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Why I built Zasper ?</h2><a id="user-content-why-i-built-zasper-" aria-label="Permalink: Why I built Zasper ?" href="#why-i-built-zasper-"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">There are several proprietary JupyterLab-like frontend tools available in the market, such as Databricks Notebooks and Deepnote Notebooks. However, none of them are free or open-source, and most require users to work in the cloud. Even the modest personal computers these days are typically equipped with at least 8 GB of RAM, an 8-core CPU, and a decent 4 GB GPU, I saw an opportunity to create a solution that works seamlessly on local machines. That’s why I decided to build Zasper which can effectively utilize the resources available and guarantee maximum efficiency.</p>
<p dir="auto">Originally I wrote <a href="https://github.com/zasper-io/zasper_py">https://github.com/zasper-io/zasper_py</a> (now in Private mode) to build a new frontend around Jupyter. During the process I realized, Go is the ideal choice to rebuild the Jupyter project. Go has excellent support for REST, RPC, WS protocols. Concurrency and Performance are the areas where Go shines.</p>
<p dir="auto">Go's Concurrency: Better suited for applications requiring both concurrency and parallelism, as it leverages multiple cores effectively. It's easier to handle blocking operations without freezing the system.</p>
<p dir="auto">Python's Event Loop: Ideal for I/O-bound applications that need to handle a lot of asynchronous tasks without blocking. However, it struggles with CPU-bound tasks and lacks native parallelism unless additional worker threads are used.</p>
<p dir="auto">Hence the Go version of Zasper was born!</p>

						<p>Not sure what will happen, but if the discussions in this forum started older than 10 years were to be no longer available, it would be really bad. If that really happens, I'd suggest those who post/learn frequently in this forum move to other alternatives, such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theswamp.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">https://www.theswamp.org/</a>&nbsp; and stop responding questions here, knowing your efforts will be gone/thrown away!</p>

<p>They should have something equivalent or better available and is embraced by users before cutting existing useful stuff off.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

						<p>I've already switched to posting code on GitHub instead of/in addition to posting it here, for that and other reasons I'd rather not discuss here.</p><p>The thing that has me scratching my head, is the criteria that any thread started 10+ years ago is to be <strike>archived</strike> deleted, regardless of how recently it was updated or how relevant its contents are.</p><p>The suggestion that 'the team' is going to go through that much old content and identify what's worth keeping is pure fiction, as if we couldn't figure out how much work by qualified people would be needed to do that.</p><p>It would seem to appear that legacy products (namedly AutoCAD) is what's being targeted, as there's not very much 10-year-old content for products/services being pushed/promoted today.</p><p>The problem is that much of what Autodesk would like you to replace its legacy products with, is already on the verge of becoming obsolete itself.</p><p>It's not just Autodesk whose very existence is threatened by the rise of AI and AGI. Most vendors of 'traditional' software applications are being regarded as endangered species. For Autodesk and its competitors, the emergence of things like DeepMind's <a href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/genie-2-a-large-scale-foundation-world-model" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">Genie2</a> and <a href="https://www.worldlabs.ai/blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">WorldLabs' Spatial Intelligence</a> initiative (both of which are being positioned as foundations for end-to-end solutions for all types of design, as well as other things like gaming), will make application software and services as we know them today, totally obsolete.</p>

This is without a doubt, the most monumental act of stupidity ever in the company as you have single-handedly crippled the developer community. In no universe could this ever be considered a good idea. Imagine a civilization deleting their history. What you have done is virtually equivalent to this. I cannot imagine how you possibly came up with any benefit this could have for anyone. I cannot even fathom that you would conjure this idea in your mind and, after thorough contemplation, that others would agree to doing this.</p>

According <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/91183cbb-50f9-464a-9d2e-96063825bfcf">to the <em>Financial Times</em></a>:</p>

  <blockquote data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/blockquote/instances/cm5blel7e001u3b7z1ij4ha02@published" data-editable="text" data-word-count="99"><p>The Silicon Valley group is rolling out a range of AI products, including one that helps users create AI characters on Instagram and Facebook, as it battles with rival tech groups to attract and retain a younger audience. “We expect these AIs to actually, over time, exist on our platforms, kind of in the same way that accounts do,” said Connor Hayes, vice-president of product for generative AI at Meta. “They’ll have bios and profile pictures and be able to generate and share content powered by AI on the platform . . . that’s where we see all of this going,” he added.</p></blockquote>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cm5ble2bm00173b7zyfwbqggi@published" data-word-count="193">The company has been <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/how-meta-is-using-bots-to-automate-facebook-and-instagram.html">talking about this for a while</a>, to somewhat bewildered responses from the general public. The simplest explanation for what it’s doing is that the company has invested a lot in building generative AI models and would like to get a return on its investment through its most lucrative products: If there’s any economically productive way for Meta to plug AI tools into Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, it’ll consider it. But Meta, a company with no qualms about <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2023/04/why-every-app-now-feels-like-tiktok-but-worse.html">chasing</a>, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-developer-mark-zuckerberg-invented-instagram-stories-copied-snapchat-2020-4">copying</a>, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/08/technology/mark-zuckerberg-whatsapp.html">acquiring</a> its way into trends, is also <em>reacting</em> here. It <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/does-anyone-need-an-ai-social-network.html">bought</a> SocialAI, a Twitter-ish “social network” where users’ “feeds” and “comment sections” are filled entirely with bots playing different characters. At the same time, it’s surely noticed that its platforms are already filling with AI slop <em>anyway </em>and that <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/ai-generated-content-internet-online-slop-spam.html">some of this slop was creating a lot of engagement</a>, meaning that, in the ways that matter most to Meta, it’s not really slop at all. The company also <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/what-messing-with-chatbots-tells-us-about-the-future-of-ai.html">clearly noticed</a> the rise of Character.ai, the popular —&nbsp;but possibly doomed —&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/12/10/character-ai-lawsuit-teen-kill-parents-texas/">lawsuit magnet</a> of an app in which young users create and chat and act out fictional scenarios with AI characters.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cm5ble2ey00183b7ze00durwr@published" data-word-count="70">Still, Meta’s framing here is unique to the company. It’s by far the leading American social-network firm, with more than a billion actual people using its products around the world to interact with one another. Practically everyone in tech is trying practically everything with AI, but Meta, the suggestion goes, is in a singular position to populate shared <em>human</em> spaces with synthetic characters, and it seems to think it’ll work.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cm5ble2h900193b7zsq42wwjt@published" data-word-count="128">As galling as this might sound to a casual Facebook user —&nbsp;after years of characterizing fake and automated profiles as spam, it’s okay now if Meta is running the accounts and they’re a little more convincing? — it has the benefit of sounding somewhat new and novel. Maybe these personas really will be engaging enough to post and respond alongside your friends, family, co-workers, and celebrities in your existing social-media feeds; maybe social-media feeds are the right place to encounter highly specific chatbots; maybe these chatbots can be entertaining or even helpful in the context of the apps users already check multiple times per day. It might not be a convincing story, but it’s a story: <em>There are increasingly intelligent bots among us, and they’re joining social media.&nbsp;</em></p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cm5ble2kq001a3b7zuk9i0bp3@published" data-word-count="216">The main benefit of this story is that, like a lot of AI products —&nbsp;it’s right there in the name! — it <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2023/11/elon-musks-grok-ai-bot-is-anti-woke-what-does-that-mean.html">anthropomorphizes</a> the underlying technology. A less compelling but perhaps more honest and useful way to characterize Meta’s impulse here is as the next step in a long process of automation and social mediation. When Facebook and Instagram were new, the content you encountered wasn’t just created by people you knew or chose to follow —&nbsp;it carried with it legible and obvious evidence of provenance. If you saw something from someone you didn’t follow or intend to interact with, it was because someone you know chose to share it; if you posted something, you could mostly assume it would be seen by people who intended to see it, and maybe by more people they intended to show it to. Well before the rise of TikTok, which mostly replaced follow/follower relationships with opaque algorithmic distribution, but especially after it, Facebook and Instagram have leaned hard into <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/how-meta-is-using-bots-to-automate-facebook-and-instagram.html">subtler forms of automation</a>: content recommendations; people recommendations; unexplained stuff appearing in feeds, as Reels, or bugging users in notifications. The result is platforms where users are consuming more content but in some cases producing less, spaces that function less like social networks than like targeted advertising systems for everything.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cm5ble2mc001b3b7zvcdkmtp6@published" data-word-count="70">A lot of formerly social aspects of a platform like Facebook, in other words, have already been automated and replaced with machine learning, but each step in this direction has been subtle and somewhat concealed: You don’t really know, and certainly aren’t clearly told, why Meta assumes this or that Instagram Reel is something you want to see, or why one thing appears above another in an algorithmically sorted feed.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cm5ble2o9001c3b7zyqi3k2aw@published" data-word-count="146">The idea of introducing AI characters into Meta’s platforms is in some ways distinct and new —&nbsp;we’re talking about not just automating content curation and promotion here but, in some cases, actual creation — but can also be understood as a way to rebrand an effective but alienating overhaul that’s been a decade in the making. With many AI products —&nbsp;from ChatGPT to a customer-support bot — the performance of personhood, which is a bit of a <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2023/01/why-artificial-intelligence-often-feels-like-magic.html">misleading magic trick</a> even when done carefully, is at least as important as raw capabilities. Meta can claim it’s building technology to create social-media agents that can exist on its platforms “in the same way that accounts do,” and maybe it’ll turn out to be right. But Meta’s AI characters are also a way to slap a more friendly, humanlike face on a long, bloodless campaign of social automation.</p>

   wikis are companions

   a wiki for you--
   just you

   to add, read, delete,
   expand

   a changeling, chaotic,
   inconsistent, wild,
   forever flailing and
   uncertain,
   like you

   ...

   a blog is a storefront

   pretty products adorned, designed,
   pristine and tailored, for them

   skinny plastic legs
   poke through perfect plastic
   casing

   landfills of abandoned posts
   decay

   ...

   a wiki is an abyss

   thoughts written alone
   unravel, and
   stitch themselves with meaning

   ...

   blogs rot.
   wikis wait.

            <p>Today, many Americans are making a New Year's resolution to exercise more.</p><p>It's well-known that regular exercise is good for your health. But a new scientific consortium is revealing fresh insights into just how profound the benefits are for the human body.</p><p>William Brangham spoke recently with someone who's helping lead this research, Euan Ashley. He's a professor of cardiovascular medicine and genetics at Stanford University and the newly named chair of its Department of Medicine. And he calls exercise the single most potent medical intervention ever known.</p>
        </div>

        <li>
                <div>
            <p><strong>William Brangham:</strong></p>
            <p>Euan Ashley, so good to have you on the "News Hour."</p><p>You are undertaking this massive multidisciplinary study to understand how exercise changes our body in some fundamental way. But, as I mentioned, don't we already know a lot of this? I mean, what is the importance of doing this much deeper dive that you're doing?</p>
        </div>
            </li>
        <li>
                <div>
            <p><strong>Dr. Euan Ashley, Stanford University:</strong></p>
            <p>Well, look, we have known for maybe 70 years that exercise was among one of the most potent medical interventions known.</p><p>We knew from studies in the 1950s comparing London bus drivers and London bus conductors that lived in the same environment, but one — they had the bus drivers who were sitting, the conductors were standing, and the heart disease rate among the drivers was twice that of the conductors.</p><p>So yes, we have known for 70 years that exercise is really, really good for you. But we have not through that entire time really understood how it works. So the new study was to bring together 17, 18 different groups from across the United States to really study, to build a molecular map of exercise to try and work out how come this intervention that's so available to all of us is the most powerful intervention known.</p><p>How does it actually work?</p>
        </div>
            </li>
        <li>
                <div>
            <p><strong>William Brangham:</strong></p>
            <p>And so you have started to publish some of your findings. When you compare exercise to these other critical things that we know are important for health, diet or sleep or things like that, where does exercise fit in? What are the sort of top-line findings of exercise's potency?</p>
        </div>
            </li>
        <li>
                <div>
            <p><strong>Dr. Euan Ashley:</strong></p>
            <p>Well, one of the things that really surprised us — were all exercise people already, so we were all convinced as to the benefits.</p><p>So — though, in this study, we also had a control group. So the first study we released was rats that were sedentary, and then they were trained over the course of eight weeks aerobic training on — literally on a treadmill. And then at the end of the period of time and at the end of several time points along that eight-week time period, we looked at the tissues from the rats.</p><p>And the thing that we were really surprised to find was that really they turned into almost different beings. I mean, exercise was that potent. Every single tissue we looked at should something completely different from before. It really changed the entire molecular makeup of the individual organs of the rats in a very positive direction.</p><p>One example might be that multiple tissues, for example, fat tissue. Another example would be the mitochondria, the little battery-like organelles inside each cells. When we looked at the changes with exercise, we often saw mirror image changes to the ones we see with disease.</p><p>So, exercise was quite literally kind of reversing in a mirror-image-like way the changes that happen with disease and explaining a little bit about how exercise manages to protect from those diseases.</p>
        </div>
            </li>
        <li>
                <div>
            <p><strong>William Brangham:</strong></p>
            <p>I mean, some of the other findings I read in your initial research is showing that exercise impacts the body in ways that we don't associate with exercise, the digestive system, the mood and mental health.</p><p>How do you explain that mechanism being so widespread?</p>
        </div>
            </li>
        <li>
                <div>
            <p><strong>Dr. Euan Ashley:</strong></p>
            <p>Well, I think one of the things is that exercise, at the end of the day, is a stress. And we don't recommend stress for anyone, certainly not work stress.</p><p>But the reality is, I think that stressing our bodies with exercise in just the right amount actually prepares our bodies to deal with the stress of everyday life. One of the biggest signatures we saw was in a system that basically tends to the proteins in our cells. So it helps them come together in the right format in three dimensions. It stops them sticking together and aggregating.</p><p>And when it's time for those proteins to be renewed, it helps. It's called the heat shock response. And this was something that we saw changed across multiple tissues, across all the tissues, as you mentioned, lungs, skeletal muscle, not just the ones that you might expect. We would expect perhaps skeletal muscle and heart, for sure.</p><p>But we were seeing changes in the kidney, in the adrenal gland, in the intestine, in the brain. And I think that begins to get at how exercise is just such a remarkable intervention, essentially helping with, for example, reducing the risk of heart disease by 50 percent, reducing the list of many cancers by 50 percent and more, reducing the risk of back pain.</p><p>People sleep better. They have better mood. They're able to breathe better. There are just so many ways in which exercise helps. And I think the key is, is just stressing you just enough so that your body then in recovery builds these mechanisms that help you deal with the stress of life in other ways.</p>

            <p><strong>Dr. Euan Ashley:</strong></p>
            <p>Yes, I think one of the other things we were really surprised by was just the extent of the changes.</p><p>In this study, we had both mail and female rats. And of course, we expected to see some changes, but really the changes were profound. And we saw them both at rest before we started, but also with exercise. Some things got closer together with exercise between the sexes. Some things got further apart.</p><p>And this was the case particularly in adipose tissue and in skeletal muscle, where we really saw very profound differences between the two sexes. And I think what it led us to believe is that really every study from now on should be done with both sexes.</p><p>This is something we have known for some time, but, over the history of science, we have tended, just because science costs a lot of money, to choose one or the other. We do studies in all males or all females, or both when we could. But, often, the numbers were smaller then, and that gave us less power for discovery.</p><p>What's really clear, I think, from this study is that we really have to do both sexes in order to really work out what the differences are and be able to describe them adequately for both sexes.</p>

            <p><strong>William Brangham:</strong></p>
            <p>I know people listening to you will, of course, be wondering — I'm sure you get this question all the time — what kind of exercise, how often? Does it matter when I do it, how much I do it? What does your research indicate?</p>
        </div>
            </li>
        <li>
                <div>
            <p><strong>Dr. Euan Ashley:</strong></p>
            <p>Well, this particular research with the rats doesn't answer that question, but, fortunately, we have lots of research to give us a good answer to that question.</p><p>And although you read lots of different things as every new study comes up, the overall advice has remained the same. The first thing is, any movement is better than none. So, if you're in a sedentary job or you're not used to moving much, then just stand up. Standing up is a good start.</p><p>If you can walk, take some walking paces, go for a walk at lunchtime, that's great as well. If you can get 30 to 45 minutes of moderate intensity exercise, that's like a brisk walk, if you can do that five, six times a week, that's fantastic.</p><p>And, of course, if you want to do more, there's added benefit. One of the things I regularly tell my patients — I'm a cardiologist — is that one minute of exercise buys you five minutes of extra life, which means you definitely have time to exercise, because, even if you exercise even a little bit higher intensity, you get seven or eight minutes of extra life.</p><p>So you definitely have time to make in your day to exercise. It doesn't matter whether you do it in the morning, at lunchtime, in the evenings. It's particularly good after meals, so the evening is a fine time to take a brisk walk.</p><p>But the main thing is get up, move about as much as you can.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As part of their "Defective by Design" anti-DRM campaign, the FSF recently made the following claim:<br><q>Today, most of the major streaming media platforms utilize the TPM to decrypt media streams, forcefully placing the decryption out of the user's control</q> (from <a href="https://www.defectivebydesign.org/dayagainstdrm">here</a>).<br>This is part of an overall argument that Microsoft's insistence that only hardware with a TPM can run Windows 11 is with the goal of aiding streaming companies in their attempt to ensure media can only be played in tightly constrained environments.</p><p>I'm going to be honest here and say that I don't know what Microsoft's actual motivation for requiring a TPM in Windows 11 is. I've been talking about TPM stuff for a long time. My job involves writing a lot of TPM code. I think having a TPM enables a number of worthwhile security features. Given the choice, I'd certainly pick a computer with a TPM. But in terms of whether it's of sufficient value to lock out Windows 11 on hardware with no TPM that would otherwise be able to run it? I'm not sure that's a worthwhile tradeoff.</p><p>What I <em>can</em> say is that the FSF's claim is just 100% wrong, and since this seems to be the sole basis of their overall claim about Microsoft's strategy here, the argument is pretty significantly undermined. I'm not aware of any streaming media platforms making use of TPMs in any way whatsoever. There <em>is</em> hardware DRM that the media companies use to restrict users, but it's not in the TPM - it's in the GPU.</p><p>Let's back up for a moment. There's multiple different DRM implementations, but the big three are Widevine (owned by Google, used on Android, Chromebooks, and some other embedded devices), Fairplay (Apple implementation, used for Mac and iOS), and Playready (Microsoft's implementation, used in Windows and some other hardware streaming devices and TVs). These generally implement several levels of functionality, depending on the capabilities of the device they're running on - this will range from all the DRM functionality being implemented in software up to the hardware path that will be discussed shortly. Streaming providers can choose what level of functionality and quality to provide based on the level implemented on the client device, and it's common for 4K and HDR content to be tied to hardware DRM. In any scenario, they stream encrypted content to the client and the DRM stack decrypts it before the compressed data can be decoded and played.</p><p>The "problem" with software DRM implementations is that the decrypted material is going to exist somewhere the OS can get at it at some point, making it possible for users to simply grab the decrypted stream, somewhat defeating the entire point. Vendors try to make this difficult by obfuscating their code as much as possible (and in some cases putting some of it in-kernel), but pretty much all software DRM is at least somewhat broken and copies of any new streaming media end up being available via Bittorrent pretty quickly after release. This is why higher quality media tends to be restricted to clients that implement hardware-based DRM.</p><p>The implementation of hardware-based DRM varies. On devices in the ARM world this is usually handled by performing the cryptography in a Trusted Execution Environment, or TEE. A TEE is an area where code can be executed without the OS having any insight into it at all, with ARM's TrustZone being an example of this. By putting the DRM code in TrustZone, the cryptography can be performed in RAM that the OS has no access to, making the scraping described earlier impossible. x86 has no well-specified TEE (Intel's SGX is an example, but is no longer implemented in consumer parts), so instead this tends to be handed off to the GPU. The exact details of this implementation are somewhat opaque - of the previously mentioned DRM implementations, only Playready does hardware DRM on x86, and I haven't found any public documentation of what drivers need to expose for this to work.</p><p>In any case, as part of the DRM handshake between the client and the streaming platform, encryption keys are negotiated with the key material being stored in the GPU or the TEE, inaccessible from the OS. Once decrypted, the material is decoded (again either on the GPU or in the TEE - even in implementations that use the TEE for the cryptography, the actual media decoding may happen on the GPU) and displayed. One key point is that the decoded video material is still stored in RAM that the OS has no access to, and the GPU composites it onto the outbound video stream (which is why if you take a screenshot of a browser playing a stream using hardware-based DRM you'll just see a black window - as far as the OS can see, there <em>is</em> only a black window there).</p><p>Now, TPMs are sometimes referred to as a TEE, and in a way they are. However, they're fixed function - you can't run arbitrary code on the TPM, you only have whatever functionality it provides. But TPMs <em>do</em> have the ability to decrypt data using keys that are tied to the TPM, so isn't this sufficient? Well, no. First, the TPM can't communicate with the GPU. The OS could push encrypted material to it, and it would get plaintext material back. But the entire point of this exercise was to avoid the decrypted version of the stream from ever being visible to the OS, so this would be pointless. And rather more fundamentally, TPMs are <em>slow</em>. I don't think there's a TPM on the market that could decrypt a 1080p stream in realtime, let alone a 4K one.</p><p>The FSF's focus on TPMs here is not only technically wrong, it's indicative of a failure to understand what's actually happening in the industry. While the FSF has been focusing on TPMs, GPU vendors have quietly deployed all of this technology without the FSF complaining at all. Microsoft has enthusiastically participated in making hardware DRM on Windows possible, and user freedoms have suffered as a result, but Playready hardware-based DRM works just fine on hardware that doesn't have a TPM and will continue to do so.</p></div></div>]]></description>

							<h3 id="h-origin">Origin</h3>
<p>One popular fact included on numerous list of "science facts that sound wrong" is the claim that there are more trees on Earth than stars in our own Milky Way galaxy. This claim has its origins in a September 2015 <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14967.epdf" target="_blank">paper</a> published in the scientific journal Nature titled “Mapping Tree Density at a Global Scale,” which provided an estimate for the number of trees on Earth of 3.04 trillion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We provide the first spatially continuous map of forest tree density at a global scale. This map reveals that the global number of trees is approximately 3.04 trillion, an order of magnitude higher than the previous estimate. Of these trees, approximately 1.30 trillion exist in tropical and subtropical forests, with 0.74 trillion in boreal regions and 0.66 trillion in temperate regions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to <a href="https://asd.gsfc.nasa.gov/blueshift/index.php/2015/07/22/how-many-stars-in-the-milky-way/" target="_blank">NASA</a> education and outreach specialist Maggie Masetti, most estimates put the number of stars in the Milky Way at between 100 billion and 400 billion stars:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are different models for estimating the number of stars in the Milky Way and the answers they give differ depending on what is used as the average mass of a star. The most common answer seems to be that there are 100 billion stars in the Milky Way on the low-end and 400 billion on the high end. But I’ve seen even higher numbers thrown around.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Inasmuch as these estimates approximate the actual (and impossible to verify) numbers of trees on Earth and stars in the Milky Way, the claim is accurate. However, it should be noted that estimating both the number of trees across the globe and stars in the sky is extremely difficult, and thus any such numbers come with plenty of caveats and limitations.</p>
<p>The Nature paper that estimated the number of trees arrived at a total an entire order of magnitude higher than the previous <a href="https://content.ucpress.edu/chapters/10606.ch01.pdf" target="_blank">estimate</a>, made in 2005, of 400.25 billion trees. To arrive at the 2015 estimate, scientists used 428,775 actual field measurements from selected areas and from different biomes, then created mathematical models to extrapolate to a global scale.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.space.com/25959-how-many-stars-are-in-the-milky-way.html" target="_blank">discussed</a> by Space.com’s Elizabeth Howell, coming up with an estimate for the number of stars in our galaxy carries with it even more uncertainty:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The primary way astronomers estimate stars in a galaxy is by determining the galaxy's mass. The mass is estimated by looking at how the galaxy rotates, as well as its spectrum using spectroscopy ...</p>
<p>Once a galaxy's mass is determined, the other tricky thing is figuring out how much of that mass is stars. Most of the mass will be made up of dark matter, which is a mysterious substance believed to bind most of the universe together ...</p>
<p>So is there any way to figure out how many stars are for sure? In the end, it comes down to an estimate. In one calculation, the Milky Way has a mass of about 100 billion solar masses, so it is easiest to translate that to 100 billion stars. This accounts for the stars that would be bigger or smaller than our sun, and averages them out. Other mass estimates bring the number up to 400 billion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unless someone develops a new methodology for counting stars which yields a much higher number than current estimates, it does seem as though there are more trees on Earth than stars in the Milky Way.</p>
<p>Also relevant to the discussion is the fact that the authors of the tree study estimated that around <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14967.epdf" target="_blank">15 billion</a> trees are cut down every year.</p>

	<small>12/31/2024</small><p>I never intended to work with AI or ML. It more so happened along the way naturally from using whatever tools I needed for the task, and eventually it took over. I didn't even realize it at the time.</p>

<p>Given that it is New Year's Eve, it seems appropriate to look back on my career to see how I got here. Let's go back to the year 2000 and walk through the major AI/ML projects I worked on.</p>

<hr>


<h3>If statements and random numbers</h3>

<p>I've talked about how I got into programming before: <a href="https://austinhenley.com/blog/mycomputingstory.html">Learning HTML was too hard so I made a compiler instead</a>. But along the way, I also tried to make video games (like any kid).</p>

<p>The first project I remember making in VB6 was a game based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamagotchi">Tamagotchi</a> pets.</p>

<img src="https://austinhenley.com/blog/images/tamagotchi.png" alt="">

<p>Unfortunately, I had no idea how to make the pet "come alive".</p>

<p>The best I came up with was a timer that triggers some effect every <i>X</i> seconds plus some conditionals. Increase pet's hunger every 10 seconds. Decrement health every 3 seconds if hunger level is greater than 5. Faint if health reaches 0.</p>

<p>Not a fun game at all.</p>

<p>Fast forward to high school. The biggest game I made at the time without giving up was a 2d space shooter where you defended yourself against waves of enemies while collecting simple powerups. A pretty standard exercise for a wanna-be game developer. For this, I hard coded a long, long sequence of if statements that used random numbers, how long you've been playing, how many shots you have fired, your hp, etc. to determine which wave of enemies to send out next. Finally, it felt <i>dynamic</i> and not entirely predictable. It was even almost fun. But no one would play it more than a few minutes. (Unfortunately, I can't find any screenshots from this era.)</p>

<img src="https://austinhenley.com/blog/images/programminggameaibook.jpg" alt="">

<p>Somewhere in the mid-2000s, I purchased the book <i>Programming Game AI by Example</i> (<a href="https://amzn.to/3VVu1DN">Amazon</a>). It took a few years to prove useful though...</p>


<h3>State machines and higher-order functions</h3>

<p>In college, I took it up a notch with my <a href="https://austinhenley.com/blog/makinggames.html">games</a>. They were played by millions, and I even made money! My coding skills were finally maturing, I could put what I read in books into practice, and my roommate spent every waking moment making games.</p>
    
<p>I used finite state machines for the enemy behaviors, the factory pattern to spawn and manage objects, and higher order functions to make enemies and weapons composable. Each unit, each weapon, and each bullet was given a set of behavior functions that would execute each frame to determine what happens next (e.g., the weapon will shoot bullets in bursts that are in the shape of a narrow cone that oscillates left and right 25 degrees; the bullets will slightly home into the nearest target and have a 1% chance of ricocheting)</p>

<img src="https://austinhenley.com/blog/images/ermy.png" alt="">

<p>I found that incrementally adding a bit of dynamism (i.e., based on the game state and the player's input) and variation (i.e., changing behaviors through randomness and composability) made my games much, much more fun. It required layers though. I needed to add this to everything: sprites, particle emitters, sound effects, enemies, bullets, and animations, not just the enemy behaviors.</p>

<p>The games started to feel alive!</p>

<img src="https://austinhenley.com/blog/images/darkestdays2.gif" alt="">


<p>But this isn't AI, right? In the end, it is just some handcrafted if statements and well-architectured function calls. <i>Hmmm</i>.</p>


<h3>First-order logic, knowledge representation, support vector machines, and neural networks</h3>

<p>After graduating, I enrolled in a MS program at the very last minute (as in, after the deadline and just before the Spring semester started). That meant most of the courses were full. I signed up for the only ones available, which included Artificial Intelligence and Neural Networks. I was hoping for a compilers course!</p>

<p>I was disappointed when I found out that neither of these courses involved any coding or how to implement what we learned. They were very high level and we spent a lot of arguing over definitions.</p>

<img src="https://austinhenley.com/blog/images/aibook.jpg" alt="">


<p>The AI course consisted of in-class discussions dissecting the famous book, <i>Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach, Third Edition</i> (<a href="https://amzn.to/4gDFmRq">Amazon</a>). I learned about planning, agents, first-order logic, and knowledge representation. It gave me some vocabulary for thinking about these problems, but I wasn't able to make the leap of applying any of it. <i>Sorry, <a href="https://www.norvig.com/">Norvig</a></i>.</p>

<img src="https://austinhenley.com/blog/images/neuralnetworkbook.jpg" alt="">


<p>The neural networks course was heavy on theory. We covered perceptrons, support vector machines, feedforward networks, hopfield models, and back propagation. The textbook wasn't useful so I won't link to it. I asked the professor how I could actually build a neural network and he said, <i>"I think there is a MATLAB package"</i>. Welp.</p>

<p>I spent the summer and fall trying to put this knowledge to use.</p>

<img src="https://austinhenley.com/blog/images/neuralavatar.png" alt="">


<p>I built a program for low-bandwidth video chat. I used OpenCV to detect the face, extract regions of the face, and then a classifier to determine the state of those regions. For example, is the mouth curving up? Is the left brow raised? Is the right eye open? I had several hundreds of labeled face images from some open database back then. The application sent the binary states over a socket to be used to draw an avatar using OpenGL.</p>

<p>It didn't work well. It was tedious to modify, it was extremely sensitive to lighting, minor changes to parameters would have big consequences, OpenCV was a pain to use, and training took forever.</p>

<p>I really had no idea what I was doing, but I eventually learned a lot and got it somewhat working! Here is a [very amateur] demo video that I uploaded in January 2013:</p>

<h3>Decision trees, clustering, and recommendation algorithms</h3>

<p>As I got into my PhD, I needed statistical methods to analyze log data from code editors. Can I identify when a programmer is stuck or lost in the code? Can I predict which file they'll navigate to next? Can I accurately recommend code of interest?</p>

<img src="https://austinhenley.com/blog/images/cfar.png" alt="">

<p>I learned how to use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C4.5_algorithm">C4.5 algorithm</a> to generate decision trees, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering">k-means</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBSCAN">DBCSCAN</a> to cluster events, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apriori_algorithm">Apriori</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborative_filtering">collaborative filtering</a> to find associations between events. Although fairly simple, these are surprisingly powerful. In fact, I'd say that most of the time that you think you need a big neural network, you don't!</p>

<img src="https://austinhenley.com/blog/images/wandercode.png" alt="">

<br>

<img src="https://austinhenley.com/blog/images/dbscan.png" alt="">

<p>These methods got the job done. I published papers, did a bunch of internships, and built developer tools involving these, and eventually graduated.</p>

<p>If you want to read more about some of these projects, I recommend starting with:</p>

<ul>
<li>Data analysis on how developers look for information: <i>Foraging and Navigations, Fundamentally: Developers' Predictions of Value and Cost</i> (<a href="https://austinhenley.com/pubs/Piorkowski2016FSE_ValueCost.pdf">pdf</a>)</li>
<li>My Microsoft internship experience report about building a code review bot: <a href="https://austinhenley.com/blog/featurestheywanted.html">When users never use they features they asked for</a></li>
</ul>


<h3>Intelligent user interfaces</h3>

<p>As a new tenure-track professor in 2018, I needed a schtick that I would base all my research around. I chose <i>intelligent developer tools</i>, though it was much fuzzier of a concept in my head back then. My first week on the job, I submitted a grant proposal where I'd use predictive models to preemptively identify and correct programmers' misconceptions.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1850027">abstract</a> of the proposal said:</p>

<blockquote>In particular, this project will develop novel tool designs that accomplish three mutually supportive goals: (1) identify misconceptions that novice programmers have about their program's behavior by leveraging program analysis techniques and predictive models, (2) correct novice programmers' misconceptions and explain the rationale without disrupting the programmers, and (3) prevent future misconceptions by generating test code for the novice programmers that will catch unintended changes to the program's behavior.</blockquote>

<p>I summarized that project in my post, <a href="https://austinhenley.com/blog/inquisitivecodeeditor.html">An inquisitive code editor: Overcome bugs before you know you have them</a>.</p>

<p>Next, I collaborated on a <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2008408">project</a> where we'd use models to predict the information needs of programmers and generate user interfaces for them on the fly (e.g., if they're looking through their git history for relevant code, generate a visualization comparing a recommended set of commits).</p>

<p>Then I tied all this work together into my grand vision: <i>Inquisitive Programming Environments as Learning Environments for Novices and Experts</i>. You can see the proposal (<a href="https://austinhenley.com/pubs/Henley2021NSFCAREER.pdf">pdf</a>) and my blog post on how I wrote it (<a href="https://austinhenley.com/blog/500kgrant.html">What a $500,000 grant proposal looks like</a>).</p>

<img src="https://austinhenley.com/blog/images/grantoverview.png" alt="">

<p>However, I <a href="https://austinhenley.com/blog/leavingacademia.html">resigned</a> right around the time I was notified the grant was being funded, so I didn't get to make more progress.</p>


<h3>Program synthesis and large-language models</h3>

<p>In January 2022, I joined the program synthesis team at Microsoft. Now I was immersed in AI. It was perfect timing because ChatGPT was released 10 months later and the world forced LLMs upon everything.</p>

<img src="https://austinhenley.com/blog/images/datawranglerbyexample.gif" alt="A gif of me performing the New Column by Example operation.">

<p>Although I was on an AI team, I often pushed back against applying AI unless we had a really compelling reason. What is the user problem we are trying to solve? Do we really need an LLM or could a few if statements suffice? Are we sure that natural language is the appropriate interface for this? I went on to share my opinions: <a href="https://austinhenley.com/blog/naturallanguageui.html">Natural language is the lazy interface</a> and <a href="https://austinhenley.com/blog/trappedchat.html">Don't trap me in a chat window</a>.</p>

      <h2>Rails for everything</h2>

      <p><em>Published: 2025-01-01</em></p>

      <p>
        After spending part of my holiday building and deploying a new Rails 8
        application, It's clearer than ever that Rails is awesome, and it's
        especially great for small projects with a single developer.
      </p>

      <h3>Guide is good</h3>

      <p>
        The latest
        <a href="https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html#Rails-philosophy">Getting Started with Rails</a>
        guide is really excellent. There's a bit of hand waving around
        installing Ruby (which is still more difficult than it needs to be). But
        if you follow it start to finish, you'll have a Rails app
        <strong>in production</strong>. And it isn't just
        <code>hello world</code>. Your app will have authentication, caching,
        rich text, continuous integration, and a database. That's a real
        application.
      </p>

      <p>If you're brand new to Rails, the guide is the best place to start.</p>

      <h3>SQLite is all you need</h3>

      <p>
        SQlite is a great tool, but its focus on backwards compatibility means
        that it wasn't ideal for a production database out of the box. You
        <a href="https://fractaledmind.github.io/2024/04/15/sqlite-on-Rails-the-how-and-why-of-optimal-performance/">had to add some gems</a>
        to get it ready to perform. However
        <a href="https://fractaledmind.github.io/2024/10/16/sqlite-supercharges-Rails/">Rails 8</a>
        deals with that for you, and SQLite is ready for production.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now that you SQLite is a more robust choice, you don't have to worry
        about spinning up a PostgreSQL server. On top of that, with tools like
        <a href="https://dev.37signals.com/solid-cache/">solid cache</a> you
        don't need to stand up redis either.
      </p>

      <p>Everything is running under Rails and within SQLite. Superb.</p>

      <h3>Easy CI</h3>

      <p>
        After I pushed my initial Rails commit, I got an unexpected email:
        <code>Run failed: CI - main</code>. My first thought was actually a
        malicious actor, but I was wrong.
        <a href="https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html#continuous-integration-with-github-actions">Rails 8 comes with basic CI config</a>
        and
        <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-your-products/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions">Github comes with 2000 free minutes per month</a>
        of actions usage.
      </p>

      <p>
        Aside from it being really cool to have CI with no effort, 2000 minutes
        of run time is a lot for solo developer!
      </p>

      <h3>Authentication generator</h3>

      <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/heartcombo/devise">Devise</a> is the
        canonical authentication gem. But it hides a lot of complexity and it's
        not exactly easy to configure correctly, especially for a beginner.
      </p>

      <p>
        Rails 8 adds a new authentication generator. It add a simple sign in
        flow for existing users. All you need to do is add a user via the Rails
        console and boom. You can log in.
      </p>

      <p>The generated code is pretty minimal and easy to read about.</p>

      <h3>Easy and fast deploys with Kamal</h3>

      <p>
        I am more than happy to leave deploys to my very smart friends in the
        ops team. To deploy a new Rails 8 app, I just needed to update a few
        items in <code>deploy.yml</code>, follow a few directions, and I had an
        app live! With SSL!
      </p>

      <p>
        Honestly it took less time to get a web app up than it took me to get
        SSL on a Github page.
      </p>

      <p>
        CI + easy deploys might be the best part about Rails 8. Even just using
        the getting started guide, it encourages best practices.
      </p>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>

      <p>
        <a href="https://israilsdead.com/">Rails is not dead</a>; It's better
        than ever. Try using it to make something new this year.
      </p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><i><a href="https://blog.jacobvosmaer.nl/">Jacob Vosmaer's blog</a></i></p>

<p>2024-12-31</p>

<p>In this post I will talk about my favourite computer ergonomics hack, a DIY device I call "The Beeper".</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>I built the Beeper almost 8 years ago but I have never written a blog post about it and I thought it might be interesting. I do computer work sitting down at a desk at home. When I get focused on my work then I sit still for too long and my body starts hurting. The Beeper solves the sitting still problem.</p>

<p>The Beeper consitst of three parts: the hardware, the firmware runnning on the hardware, and software running on my work computer. If my computer screen is unlocked for too long, the Beeper starts beeping and because it is situated away from my desk I must get up to silence it. Mission accomplished: I stopped sitting still.</p>

<h2>Hardware</h2>

<p>The Beeper is built into a small ABS Hammond <a href="https://www.hammfg.com/electronics/small-case/plastic/1551">1551KTBU</a> enclosure.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.jacobvosmaer.nl/0036-beeper/assets/beeper-outside.jpeg" alt="Exterior of the Beeper"></p>

<p>Inside the enclosure are an Adafruit Feather Huzzah ESP8266 development board, a momentary switch and a piezo buzzer. The buzzer is glued to the case.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.jacobvosmaer.nl/0036-beeper/assets/beeper-inside.jpeg" alt="Interior components of the Beeper"></p>

<p>The switch connects to the RST and GND pins of the Huzzah. Pushing the switch resets the microcontroller. The buzzer is connected to a PWM pin and GND.</p>

<p>The Huzzah is powered over its Micro-USB port. I cut a hole in the case that lets the USB plug come through. ABS plastic is easy to drill, cut and file.</p>

<h2>Firmware</h2>

<p>I'm a little fuzzy on how I got the firmware working because it's so long ago and I don't work with ESP8266 or Lua often. I had to upload a <a href="https://www.nodemcu.com/index_en.html">NodeMCU</a> binary blob to the development board.  I then somehow configured the ESP8266 to connect to our home WiFi network and when it starts up it runs the following Lua script.</p>

<pre><code>
-- init.lua: Beeper firmare

pin0 = 3
pin2 = 4
pin5 = 1

-- Periodically blink the LED connected to pin0
function blink()
  gpio.mode(pin0, gpio.OUTPUT)
  gpio.write(pin0, gpio.HIGH)
  tmr.create():alarm(10000, tmr.ALARM_AUTO, function() 
    gpio.write(pin0, gpio.LOW)
    tmr.create():alarm(100, tmr.ALARM_SINGLE, function()
      gpio.write(pin0, gpio.HIGH)
    end)
  end)
end

-- TCP server that lets us remote-control the device over WiFi
function startserver()
  sv = net.createServer(net.TCP, 30)
  gpio.mode(pin2, gpio.OUTPUT)
  gpio.write(pin2, gpio.HIGH)
  gpio.mode(pin5, gpio.OUTPUT)
  if sv then
    sv:listen(5678, function(conn)
      conn:on("receive", function(sock)
        sock:close()
        gpio.write(pin2, gpio.LOW)
        beep()
      end)
    end)
  end
end

-- The beeping magic
function beep()
  freq = node.random(500) + 500
  delay = node.random(1000) + 1000
  pwm.setup(pin5, freq, 500)
  pwm.stop(pin5)
  tmr.create():alarm(delay/2, tmr.ALARM_SINGLE, function()
    pwm.start(pin5)
    tmr.create():alarm(delay, tmr.ALARM_SINGLE, beep)
  end)
end

blink()
startserver()
</code></pre>

<p>The high level description is that this script blinks an LED every 10s to show that the microcontroller hasn't halted and it starts a TCP server on port 5678. If anything connects to that port the connection handler calls a function called <code>beep()</code> which effectively loops forever because it keeps rescheduling itself with a timer. Every <code>beep()</code> invocation produces a shrill, annoying beep of random pitch and duration. I added the randomness because it makes it harder to mentally tune out the noise.</p>

<p>The only way to get this annoying beeping to stop is to reset the microcontroller with the switch.</p>

<h2>Software</h2>

<p>The software running on my laptop is the part I have had to tweak the most over the years. It has the biggest impact on the user experience and it is important to get this right, because if the Beeper is too annoying I will unplug it and then I no longer get the health benefits.</p>

<p>The current iteration of the laptop software is the following script.</p>

<pre><code>
#!/bin/sh
set -e

screen_locked() {
  ioreg -n Root -d1 -a | grep -q CGSSessionScreenIsLocked
}

external_monitor() {
  # The model identifier of my external monitor is EV2785
  system_profiler SPDisplaysDataType | grep -q EV2785
}

do_sleep() {
  sleep_time=1200
  expect_done=$(($(date +%s) + $sleep_time))
  sleep $sleep_time
  delta=$(($(date +%s) - $expect_done))
  if [ $(($delta * $delta)) -gt 100 ]
  then
    echo 'clock skew'
    exit 0
  fi
}

main() {
  do_sleep

  if ! screen_locked &amp;&amp; external_monitor &amp;&amp; ! pgrep -q zoom.us
  then
    echo hello | nc $IP $PORT
  fi
}

main
</code></pre>

<p>This script is started automatically by a macOS LaunchAgent. It sleeps for 20 minutes (which is the time I'm allowing myself not to move), checks if it is appropriate to beep and if so it activates the Beeper. If not then the script exits, macOS restarts it and we wait another 20 minutes.</p>

<p>If my screen is locked then I'm probably not sitting at my desk so we should not beep then. If I'm using my laptop somewhere else in the house away from my desk then the beeping would also be too annoying so we check if the external monitor that sits on my desk is connected to the computer. Finally, after many Zoom calls where I had to ask people to wait while I got up and turned off the beeper, I decided it would be better to not beep while I'm in a meeting.</p>

<p>It's certainly less awkward to not have the Beeper do its magic during a video call but in my experience video calls can be even worse than focused programming when it comes to sitting still too long. Arguably, I should not be suppressing the Beeper then. But I just got fed up with having to explain to the other participants in Zoom calls why I have to get up all the time.</p>

<h2>Conclusion and acknowledgments</h2>

<p>It's a silly device but it works. I am happy about how simple it is. It appears that the 10 seconds it takes for me to get up and push the button are enough to counteract the discomfort caused by sitting still too long.</p>

<p>As a closing thought I want to acknowledge and thank my wife for pointing out to me that I sit still too much and for putting up with the horrible screeching noises from the Beeper for the past 8 years and counting.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

		<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>We’re sharing details about </span><a href="https://glean.software/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Glean</span></a><span>, Meta’s open source system for collecting, deriving, and working with facts about source code.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>In this blog post we’ll talk about why a system like Glean is important, explain the rationale for Glean’s design, and run through some of the ways we’re using Glean to supercharge our developer tooling at Meta.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>In August 2021 we open-sourced our code indexing system </span><a href="https://glean.software/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Glean</span></a><span>. Glean collects information about source code and provides it to developer tools through an efficient and flexible query language. We use Glean widely within Meta to power a range of developer tools including code browsing, code search, and documentation generation.</span></p>

<p><span>Many tools that developers use rely on information extracted from the code they’re working on. For example:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Code navigation (“Go to definition”) in an IDE or a code browser;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Code search;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Automatically-generated documentation;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Code analysis tools, such as dead code detection or linting.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>The job of collecting information from code is often called </span><i><span>code indexing</span></i><span>. A code indexing system’s job is to efficiently answer the questions your tools need to ask, such as, “Where is the definition of </span><span>MyClass</span><span>?” or “Which functions are defined in </span><span>myfile.cpp</span><span>?”</span></p>
<p><span>An IDE will typically do indexing as needed, when you load a new file or project for example. But the larger your codebase, the more important it becomes to do code indexing ahead of time. For large projects it becomes impractical to have the IDE process all the code of your project at startup and, depending on what language you’re using, that point may come earlier or later: C++ in particular is problematic due to the long compile times.</span></p>
<p><span>Moreover, with a larger codebase and many developers working on it, it makes sense to have a shared centralized indexing system so that we don’t repeat the work of indexing on every developer’s machine. And as the data produced by indexing can become large, we want to make it available over the network through a query interface rather than having to download it.</span></p>
<p><span>This leads to an architecture like this:<img decoding="async" src="https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Meta-Glean-image-1.png?w=768" alt="" width="636" height="450" srcset="https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Meta-Glean-image-1.png 768w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Meta-Glean-image-1.png?resize=96,68 96w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Meta-Glean-image-1.png?resize=192,136 192w" sizes="(max-width: 992px) 100vw, 62vw"></span></p>
<p><span>In practice the real architecture is highly distributed:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Indexing can be heavily parallelized and we may have many indexing jobs running concurrently;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>The query service will be widely distributed to support load from many clients that are also distributed;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>The databases will be replicated across the query service machines and also backed up centrally.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>We’ve found that having a centralized indexing infrastructure enables a wide range of powerful developer tools. We’ll talk about some of the ways we’ve deployed Glean shortly, but first we’ll dive into the rationale for Glean’s design.</span></p>
<h2><b>How is Glean different?</b></h2>
<p><span>Code indexing systems have been around for a while. For example, there’s a well-established format called </span><a href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>LSIF</span></a><span> used by IDEs that caches information about code navigation.</span></p>
<p><span>When we designed Glean we wanted a system that wasn’t tied either to particular programming languages or to any particular use case. While we had some use cases in mind that we wanted to support—primarily code navigation of course—we didn’t want to design the system around one use case, in the hope that a more general system would support emerging requirements further into the future.</span></p>
<p><span>Therefore:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Glean doesn’t decide for you what data you can store</b><span>. Indeed, most languages that Glean indexes have their own data schema and Glean can store arbitrary non-programming-language data too. The data is ultimately stored using </span><a href="https://rocksdb.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>RocksDB</span></a><span>, providing good scalability and efficient retrieval.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Glean’s query language is very general</b><span>. It’s a declarative logic-based query language that we call </span><i><span>Angle</span></i><span> (“Angle” is an anagram of “Glean”, and means “to fish”). Angle supports </span><i><span>deriving</span></i><span> information automatically, either on-the-fly at query time or ahead of time; this is a powerful mechanism that enables Glean to abstract over language-specific data and provide a language-neutral view of the data.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Storing arbitrary language-specific data can be very powerful. For example, in C++ we use the detailed data to detect dead code such as unused </span><span>#include</span><span> or </span><span>using</span><span> statements. The latter in particular is rather tricky to do correctly and requires the data to include some C++-specific details, such as which </span><span>using</span><span> statement is used to resolve each symbol reference.</span></p>
<p><span>On the other hand, clients often don’t want the full language-specific data. They want to work at a higher level of abstraction. Imagine asking questions like, “Give me the names and locations of all the declarations in this file”, which should work for any language, and which you could use to implement a code outline feature in a code browser. Glean can provide this language-neutral view of the data by defining an abstraction layer in the schema itself – the mechanism is similar to SQL views if you’re familiar with those. This means that we don’t have to compromise between having detailed language-specific data or a lowest-common-denominator language-neutral view; we can have both.</span></p>
<p><span>This generality has allowed Glean to extend to a number of use cases beyond what we originally envisaged. We’ll cover some of those later in this post.</span></p>
<h2>A taste of Angle</h2>
<p><span>Glean has a unified language, Angle, for specifying both schemas and queries. As mentioned above, each language that we index has its own schema. To give you a flavor of this, here’s a fragment of the schema for C++ function declarations:</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Meta-Glean-image-2.png?w=380" alt="" width="380" height="206" srcset="https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Meta-Glean-image-2.png 380w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Meta-Glean-image-2.png?resize=96,52 96w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Meta-Glean-image-2.png?resize=192,104 192w" sizes="(max-width: 992px) 100vw, 62vw"></p>
<p><span>Defining a schema for Glean is just like writing a set of type definitions. The braces surround a record definition, with a set of fields and their types.&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>A </span><span>FunctionDeclaration</span><span> is a </span><i><span>predicate</span></i><span> (roughly equivalent to a table in SQL).&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>The instances of a predicate are called </span><i><span>facts</span></i><span> (roughly equivalent to rows in SQL).&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>A predicate is a thing that you can query, and a query returns facts.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>To query efficiently you specify a prefix of the fields. So, for example, we can retrieve a particular </span><span>FunctionDeclaration</span><span> efficiently if we know its </span><span>name</span><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>Let’s write a query to find the function </span><span>folly::parseJson</span><span>:</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Meta-Glean-image-3.png?w=562" alt="" width="562" height="83" srcset="https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Meta-Glean-image-3.png 562w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Meta-Glean-image-3.png?resize=96,14 96w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Meta-Glean-image-3.png?resize=192,28 192w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 992px) 100vw, 62vw"></p>
<p><span>Without going into all the details, at a high level this query specifies that we want to find </span><span>FunctionDeclaration</span><span> facts that have a particular name and namespace. Glean can return results for this query in about a millisecond.</span></p>
<p><span>Angle supports more complex queries too. For example, to find all classes that inherit from a class called </span><span>exception</span><span> and have a method called </span><span>what</span><span> that overrides a method in a base class:</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Meta-Glean-image-4.png?w=717" alt="" width="717" height="240" srcset="https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Meta-Glean-image-4.png 717w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Meta-Glean-image-4.png?resize=96,32 96w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Meta-Glean-image-4.png?resize=192,64 192w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 992px) 100vw, 62vw"></p>
<p><span>This query returns the first results in a few milliseconds, and because there might be a lot of results we can fetch the results incrementally from the query server.</span></p>
<h2>Incremental indexing</h2>
<p><span>An important innovation in Glean is the ability to index </span><i><span>incrementally</span></i><span>. As the codebase grows, and the rate of change of the codebase increases (a monorepo suffers from both of these problems) we find that we can’t provide up-to-date information about the latest code because indexing the entire repository can take a long time. The index is perpetually out of date, perhaps by many hours.</span></p>
<p><span>The solution to this scaling problem is to process </span><i><span>just the changes</span></i><span>. In terms of computer science big-O notation, we want the cost of indexing to be </span><i><span>O(changes)</span></i><span> rather than </span><i><span>O(repository)</span></i><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>But actually achieving this is not as straightforward as it might sound.</span></p>
<p><span>We don’t want to destructively modify the original data, because we would like to be able to provide data at multiple revisions of the repository, and to do that without storing multiple full-sized copies of the data. So we would like to store the changes in such a way that we can view the whole index at both revisions simultaneously.</span></p>
<p><span>Even if we figure out a way to represent the changes, in practice it isn’t possible to achieve </span><i><span>O(changes)</span></i><span> for many programming languages. For example, in C++ if a header file is modified, we have to reprocess every source file that depends on it (directly or indirectly). We call this the </span><i><span>fanout</span></i><span>. So in practice the best we can do is </span><i><span>O(fanout)</span></i><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>Glean solves the first problem with an ingenious method of </span><i><span>stacking</span></i><span> immutable databases on top of each other. A stack of databases behaves just like a single database from the client’s perspective, but each layer in the stack can non-destructively add information to, or hide information from, the layers below.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Meta-Glean-image-5.png?w=569" alt="" width="569" height="458" srcset="https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Meta-Glean-image-5.png 569w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Meta-Glean-image-5.png?resize=96,77 96w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Meta-Glean-image-5.png?resize=192,155 192w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 992px) 100vw, 62vw"></p>
<p><span>The full details are beyond the scope of this post, for more on how incrementality works see: </span><a href="https://glean.software/blog/incremental/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Incremental indexing with Glean</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>Finding the fanout of a set of changes is different for each language.&nbsp; Interestingly the fanout can often be obtained using Glean queries: for example for C++, the fanout is calculated by finding all the files that </span><span>#include</span><span> one of the changed files, and then repeating that query until there are no more files to find.</span></p>
<h2>How we use Glean at Meta</h2>
<h3>Code navigation</h3>
<p><span>Code navigation at scale, on large monorepos containing millions of lines in diverse programming languages, is a challenging problem. But what makes it different from the code navigation support available in modern IDEs, other than scale? In our experience, code indexing a la Glean offers the following advantages over IDEs:</span></p>
<ol>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Instantly available: Just open the code browser web app (our internal tool uses Monaco) and navigate without waiting for the IDE, build system, and LSP server to initialize</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>More widely available: You can integrate code navigation in pretty much any app that shows code! One particularly useful integration is in your code review tool (ours is called Phabricator), but more on that later.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Full repo visibility: Glean allows you to, for example, find all the references to a function, not just the ones visible to the IDE. This is particularly useful for finding dead code, or finding clients of an API that you want to change.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Symbol search for all the languages across the whole repository.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Cross language navigation: A common situation that comes up is a remote procedure call (RPC). When browsing the code you might want to jump to the service definition or, indeed, to the service implementation itself. Another case is languages with a foreign function interface (FFI), where you would like to browse from an FFI call to the corresponding definition in the target language.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>Our architecture for code navigation is based on </span><a href="https://github.com/facebookincubator/Glean/tree/main/glean/glass" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Glass</span></a><span>, a symbol server that abstracts all the complexities of Glean by implementing the usual code navigation logic in a simple but powerful API. The code browser needs only a single Glass API call,</span><i><span> documentSymbols(repo,path,revision),</span></i><span> to obtain a list of all the definitions and references in a source file, including source and target spans. The list of definitions is used to render an outline of the file, and the list of references to render underlines that can be hovered over or clicked to navigate. Finally, other code browser features like Find References or Call Hierarchy are also driven by API calls to Glass.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Meta-Glean-image-6.png?w=844" alt="" width="844" height="186" srcset="https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Meta-Glean-image-6.png 844w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Meta-Glean-image-6.png?resize=768,169 768w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Meta-Glean-image-6.png?resize=96,21 96w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Meta-Glean-image-6.png?resize=192,42 192w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 992px) 100vw, 62vw"></p>
<p><span>The code for Glass is also open-source, you can find it in </span><a href="https://github.com/facebookincubator/Glean/tree/main/glean/glass" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>glean/glass</span></a><span> on GitHub.</span></p>
<h3>Speeding up the IDE</h3>
<p><span>Using an IDE such as VS Code on a large project, or a project with a large set of dependencies, or in a large monorepo tends to lead to a degraded experience as the IDE isn’t able to analyze all the code that you might want to explore. At Meta we’re using Glean to plug this gap for C++ developers: Because Glean has already analyzed the whole repository, C++ developers have access to basic functionality such as go-to-definition, find-references, and doc comment hovercards for the whole repository immediately on startup. As the IDE loads the files the developer is working on, the C++ language service seamlessly blends the Glean-provided data with that provided by the native clangd backend.</span></p>
<p><span>Our target was C++ developers initially because that group typically has the worst IDE experience due to the long compile times, but the approach is not specific to C++ and we imagine other languages following the same path in the future.</span></p>
<h3>Documentation generation</h3>
<p><span>The data we store in Glean includes enough information to reconstruct the full details of an API: classes, methods, type signatures, inheritance, and so on. Glean also collects documentation from the source code when it uses the standard convention for the language, e.g., in C++ the convention is </span><span>/// comment</span><span> or </span><span>/** comment */</span><span>. With API data and documentation strings in Glean we can produce automatically-generated documentation on demand.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Here’s an example page for the </span><span>folly::Singleton</span><span> type:</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Meta-Glean-image-7.png?w=1024" alt="" width="1024" height="664" srcset="https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Meta-Glean-image-7.png 1672w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Meta-Glean-image-7.png?resize=916,594 916w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Meta-Glean-image-7.png?resize=768,498 768w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Meta-Glean-image-7.png?resize=1024,664 1024w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Meta-Glean-image-7.png?resize=1536,997 1536w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Meta-Glean-image-7.png?resize=96,62 96w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Meta-Glean-image-7.png?resize=192,125 192w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 992px) 100vw, 62vw"></p>
<p><span>The data for these pages is produced by Glass and rendered by a client-side UI. The documentation is fully hyperlinked so the user can navigate around all the APIs throughout the repository easily. Meta engineers get consistent code documentation integrations across all the programming languages supported by Glean.</span></p>
<h3>Symbol IDs</h3>
<p><span>Glass assigns every symbol a </span><i><span>symbol ID</span></i><b><i>, </i></b><span>a unique string that identifies the symbol. For example, the symbol ID for </span><span>folly::Singleton</span><span> would be something like, </span><span>REPOSITORY/cpp/folly/Singleton</span><span>. The symbol ID can be used to link directly to the documentation page for the symbol, so there’s a URL for every symbol that doesn’t change even if the symbol’s definition moves around.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We can use the symbol ID to request information about a symbol from Glass, for example to find all the references to the symbol throughout the repository. All of this works for every language, although the exact format for a symbol ID varies per language.</span></p>
<h3>Analyzing code changes</h3>
<p><span>Glean indexing runs on diffs (think, “pull requests”) to extract a mechanical summary of the changeset that we call a </span><i><span>diff sketch</span></i><span>. For example, a diff might introduce a new class, remove a method, add a field to a type, introduce a new call to a function, and so on. The diff sketch lists all of these changes in a machine-readable form.</span></p>
<p><span>Diff sketches are used to drive a simple static analysis that can identify potential issues that might require further review. They can also be used to drive non-trivial lint rules, rich notifications, and semantic search over commits. One example of the latter is connecting a production stack trace to recent commits that modified the affected function(s), to help root-cause performance issues or new failures.</span></p>
<p><span>Indexing diffs also powers code navigation in our code review tools, giving code reviewers access to accurate go-to-definition on the code changes being reviewed, along with other code insights such as type-on-hover and documentation. This is a powerful lift to the code review process, making it easier for reviewers to understand the changes and provide valuable review feedback. At Meta this is enabled for a <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2022/07/27/developer-tools/programming-languages-endorsed-for-server-side-use-at-meta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">variety of different languages</a>, including C++, Python, PHP, Javascript, <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2021/04/29/developer-tools/rust/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rust</a>, Erlang, Thrift, and even Haskell.</span></p>
<h2>More applications for Glean</h2>
<p><span>Aside from the primary applications described above, Glean is also used to</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Analyse build dependency graphs.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2023/10/24/data-infrastructure/automating-dead-code-cleanup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Detect and remove dead code</span></a><span>.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Track the progress of API migrations.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Measure various metrics that contribute to code complexity.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Track test coverage and select tests to run.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2023/10/31/data-infrastructure/automating-data-removal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Automate data removal</span></a><span>.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) in AI coding assistants</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Furthermore, there are an ever-growing number of ad-hoc queries made by various people and systems to solve a variety of problems. Having a system like Glean means you can ask questions about your code: we don’t know all the questions we might want to ask, nor do we know all the data we might want to store, so Glean deliberately aims to be as general as possible on both of these fronts.</span></p>

<li><strong>Submit</strong> a short film to our Public Domain Film Remix <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2024/12/16/2025-public-domain-day-remix-contest-the-internet-archive-is-looking-for-creative-short-films-made-by-you/">contest</a>.</li>



<li><strong>Explore</strong> the works that have entered the public domain in 2025, below.</li>
</ul>



<p>On January 1, 2025, we celebrate published works from 1929 and published sound recordings from 1924 entering the public domain! The passage of these works into the public domain celebrates our shared cultural heritage. The ability to breathe new life into long forgotten works, remix the most popular and enduring works of the time, and to better circulate the oddities we find in thrift stores, attics, and on random pockets of the internet are now freely available for us all.</p>



<p>While not at the same blockbuster level as 2024 with <a href="https://archive.org/details/steamboat-willie_1928"><em>Steamboat Willie</em>’s</a> passage into the public domain, works from 1929 still inhabit strong cultural significance today. The works of 1929 continue to capture the Lost Generation’s voice, the rise of sound film, and the emerging modern moment of the 1920s.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Musical Compositions</strong></p>



<p>Show tunes and Jazz dominated the year with many standards that we remember today first being published. While best known for the 1952 film of the same name, <a href="https://archive.org/details/singin-in-the-rain-01">Singin’ in the Rain</a> was first published in 1929 and serves as the inspiration for our <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2024/12/16/2025-public-domain-day-remix-contest-the-internet-archive-is-looking-for-creative-short-films-made-by-you/">remix contest</a> this year. George Gershwin also officially published (and copyrighted) his suite <em>An American in Paris</em> following a premiere in late 1928.</p>



<p>Below is sheet music for some popular compositions of the time.</p>

<p>While not a towering work of literature, the first set of comic strips featuring Popeye also are joining the public domain. Popeye first made an appearance in <em>Thimble Theatre</em> on <a href="https://archive.org/details/popeyes-first-appearance-in-thimble-theatre-january-17-1929">January 17, 1929</a>. Initially just a side character for an adventure arc featuring gambling and sailing, Popeye rose quickly to fame. By February 4, 1931 the <em>Thimble Theatre</em> would feature a subtitle, <em>Starring Popeye</em>, before being renamed just Popeye later on.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://andygrunwald.com/blog/why-does-storing-two-factor-authentication-codes-in-your-password-manager-make-sense/">https://andygrunwald.com/blog/why-does-storing-two-factor-authentication-codes-in-your-password-manager-make-sense/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42567279">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>  <p>Modern login systems require a second factor (2FA) to log in, in addition to the standard username and password combination.
A Time-based one-time password (TOTP) as a 6-digit number is often used.
Password managers like <a href="https://1password.com/">1Password</a>, <a href="https://keepass.info/">KeePass (or respective forks)</a> and others offer the ability to store (and generate) the 2FA TOTP.</p>
<p>For a long time, I was asking myself:</p>
<p>Why is it recommended to have a Username, Password, and 2FA in the same storage (like 1Password)? Isn’t this against the basic idea of a second factor (regarding the storage places to gain access to)?</p>
<p>Or differently:</p>
<p>Is storing 2FA codes (for GitHub, Okta, etc.) in 1Password next to the username/password combination preferred? If yes, why?</p>
<p>Luckily enough, I had the opportunity to work with people who know their Security topic very well.
So, I just asked them ⬇️</p>
<hr>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/antti-kurittu/">Antti Kurittu</a> responded:</p>
<p><em>The main advantage of 2FA is that it is much more difficult to gain access to your accounts via phishing attacks. A time-based 2FA (TOTP) is time-sensitive, and a man-in-the-middle or proxy needs to be set up to capture that in real-time. Using 2FA with any provider or storage method protects against most phishing attacks seen in the wild.</em></p>
<p><em>1Password allows storing this token alongside your username and password. This is a convenient feature that is meant to make using 2FA easier. It is marginally less safe because the 2FA token is accessible to the attacker if they successfully compromise your password manager. Still, it does not remove the main benefit of using 2FA in the first place, which is neutering most phishing attacks. The 2FA token will still be required when the attacker tries to access your account.</em></p>
<p><em>The fact that 1Password offers to fill passwords based on domain name protects your account because a lookalike domain or an entirely fraudulent domain will not prompt 1Password to offer auto-filling but will require copy-pasting credentials from the app to the harmful website. If you see an autofill prompt, 1Password has associated those credentials with the website you’re accessing, including the 2FA prompt.</em></p>
<p><em>For <strong>maximum</strong> security, you can store your 2FA token elsewhere, like a YubiKey (see Yubico Authenticator) or Google Authenticator, and keep the recovery codes safe somewhere outside your computer, but for general purpose use, storing your 2FA in your password manager is an acceptable solution due to the convenience benefits it provides.</em></p>
<hr>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamesarlen/">Jamie Arlen</a> added furthermore:</p>
<p><em>There’s also the very simple view that backs the entire point of password managers: “Keeping your cryptographic keys safe is a seriously difficult problem to solve”. Centralizing them has a couple of downsides, but if you do a threat model and balance the unmitigated risks, using (for example) Google Authenticator to store your TOTP codes is significantly more likely to result in negative outcomes. The codes are only stored on the one easily lost/dropped/broken device. With 1Password, you’ve got access to them across all of your devices.</em></p>
<p><em>The pattern I use (and prefer both professionally and personally) is:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Extensive use of password manager (I use 1Password) and not browser or operating system-based password storage. This requires active curation of the profiles for the various usernames/passwords I have.</em></li>
<li><em>Store all (except two) TOTP codes and screenshots of recovery keys in 1Password</em></li>
<li><em>Additionally, store recovery keys for personal use in an encrypted drive replicated through iCloud/OneDrive/Google Drive and to a private share located at a family member’s house with a separate memorable 32-character passphrase.</em></li>
<li><em>2 TOTP codes are not stored in 1Password.</em>
<ul>
<li><em>1Password’s own TOTP code</em></li>
<li><em>The TOTP code to my “account signup email” address</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>These codes are stored on a set of three Yubikeys - one in my Every Day Carry (EDC), one in a safe place at home, and one in my bug-out bag. The recovery codes and initiation vectors for these are also in hardcopy with other important papers in a safety deposit box at the bank.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>It’s pretty secure, but most importantly, it’s a very usable system. The usability is what makes it so important. Much like the phrase “the best camera in the world is the one you have with you,” - the best password manager is the one that you actually use, and convenience will make it important.</em></p>
