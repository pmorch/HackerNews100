<!-- TODO! ping Matthew Berman about this post -->

<p>I gotta say – <em>I love it living in exponential times</em>. I can just wish that something existed and then within a month it does! This time it happened with <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-4o-image-generation/">OpenAI's 4o image generation release</a>. In this blog post I'll briefly cover the release and why I think it's pretty cool. Then I'll dive into a new opportunity that I think is even more exciting – <em>visual reasoning</em>.</p>

<h2 id="why-image-manipulation-with-llms-stinks">Why Image Manipulation with LLMs Stinks</h2>
<p>Working with images in Multimodal LLMs has been a mostly one-sided affair. On one hand, it's really cool that you can drop an image into an LLM conversation and get the model to reason about it. But when you ask the model to generate an image, there is a disconnect, because all the model can do is describe the image in text and then call out to an external image generation tool to generate the image based on that text. Text is a poor communication medium for images, and the resulting image is often quite disconnected from the expected result because the short description that the LLM provides to the image generation tool will rarely capture the full context of the conversation.</p>
<p>The problem is most pronounced when attempting to go back and forth working on an idea for an image. You can show the LLM an image of your cat and then say "make this cat wear a detective hat and a monocle". The best the model can do is to put a detective hat and monocle on <em>some</em> cat, not the one in your image. To make matters worse, the model can't even see the image that it has just created. So if you ask for a modification to first generation attempt, then the subsequent generations are really just starting over from scratch and hoping that a more detailed description to the image generation tool will make things better... it won't.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<h2 id="openais-release-brings-true-image-manipulation-to-llms">OpenAI's Release Brings True Image Manipulation to LLMs</h2>
<p>OpenAI's image generation release changes all of this. OpenAI's newest GPT-4o model carries the full context of the conversation into the image generation, and rather than call out to an external model, it is the very same GPT-4o model that does the image generation. By carrying the full context of the conversation – <em>including the previous images</em> – into the generation of the new image you can generate much more consistent imagery.</p>
<p>Thus, stealing OpenAI's example, you can show it a photo of your cat, tell it to give <em>your cat</em> a detective hat, et voila! It works!</p>

  <figcaption>Left: OpenAI's pet cat. Right: GPT-4o's generation when asked to give the same cat a detective hat and monocle. Much more consistent!</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Now if all we could do with this technology is stick silly costumes on our cats, then this would honestly be a pretty lame achievement. But think about what we're angling for here. You'll be able to turn hand-drawn garbage into sophisticated infographics and marketing material. You'll be able to take crappy matplotlib charts and reformat them as professional-looking plots that go into slides. You'll be able to try on clothes virtually before you buy them. You'll be able to create photo collages from your photos, game assets, and 3D models. You'll be able to edit your vacation photos to remove that one person who blinked. You'll be able to take a photo of your living room and try out different furniture arrangements and color schemes. You'll be able to take a photo of your garden and get suggestions for where to plant new flowers. The possibilities are endless when you can manipulate images with the full context of a conversation.</p>
<h2 id="visual-reasoning-will-be-the-real-innovation">Visual Reasoning will be the Real Innovation</h2>
<p>All of the above is but prologue for what will come next. Models perform better when they take time to reason. This is because models have no internal monologue. Whereas humans pause and think about a question prior to answering, models have to generate tokens in order to think. But to this point models have only been able to reason in the space of words, and words are ill-suited for reasoning through many types of real world problems. But soon the models' new image manipulation capabilities will power a new form of reasoning. Right now, this ability is mostly useful for image editing. Soon, models will have the ability to visualize different scenarios and visually reason about the world around them.</p>
<h3 id="demoing-visual-reasoning">Demoing Visual Reasoning</h3>
<p>Let's try out an example right now and get a glimpse of how visual reasoning will work. For our experiment we'll use <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoikSxHXBYw&amp;t=546s">Matthew Berman's marble in a cup problem</a> – it's one of his go-to reasoning challenges when playing around with a new model:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've put a marble in a glass. The glass is then turned upside down and put on a table. Then the glass is picked up and put into the microwave. Where is the marble?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's a great problem because it requires common sense knowledge of how objects work in the world, and it's especially suited for this post because it requires spatial reasoning to extrapolate to a new scenario. I asked the new GPT-4o a variant of this problem in text:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I set a plate on a table, and glass next to it. I set a marble on the plate. Then I pick up the marble, drop it in the glass. Then I turn the glass upside down and set it on the plate. Then, I pick up the glass and put it in the microwave. Where is the marble?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've added an extra item, a plate, for just a bit more complexity. Here's the answer it gave me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The marble is <strong>in the microwave, inside the glass.</strong></p>
<p>Here's a breakdown of what happened:</p>
<p>You placed a <strong>marble on the plate.</strong></p>
<p>You <strong>picked up the marble and dropped it in the glass</strong> — now the marble is <strong>in the glass.</strong></p>
<p>You <strong>turned the glass upside down and set it on the plate</strong> — unless the glass is sealed or the marble is somehow stuck, the marble would <strong>fall out onto the plate.</strong></p>
<p>Then you <strong>picked up the glass (now empty) and put it in the microwave.</strong></p>
<p>So at this point:</p>
<p>The <strong>glass is in the microwave.</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>marble is on the plate, outside</strong> the microwave.</p>
<p>But you asked: Where is the marble? You didn't say you picked it up again, so based on what you said, the marble is <strong>on the plate, not in the microwave.</strong></p>
<p>Want to run it back or add any twists?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's actually a pretty weird answer. It immediately answers – <em>incorrectly</em> – then performs post-hoc chain-of-thought reasoning and comes to the correct answer but ignores the fact that it completely contradicted itself.</p>
<p>Let's now do a vision-enhanced version of this chain-of-thought reasoning and demonstrate how spatial reasoning will improve the model's reasoning capabilities.</p>
<figure>
  <img alt="Problem Statement" src="http://arcturus-labs.com/blog/assets/visual_reasoning_is_on_its_way/real_image.png" width="600px">
  <figcaption>Problem Statement Image</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I prompted it with the following (including extra requirements to think visually):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm going to pick up the marble, put it in the glass, turn the glass over onto the plate, pick the glass up, and then put the glass in the microwave. </p>
<p>The question is, where is the marble?</p>
<p>Solve this one step at a time using images to imagine what happens at each step. For each step, first state the step, and then generate an image corresponding to what the scene will look like after that step. And then summarize the image in English, highlighting the important aspects for solving the problem.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here are the reasoning responses from the model:</p>
<figure>
  <img alt="Step 1" src="http://arcturus-labs.com/blog/assets/visual_reasoning_is_on_its_way/step1.png" width="600px">
</figure>
<blockquote>
<p>Step 1: Pick up the marble.</p>
<p>In the image, the marble has not yet been moved, but we are about to pick it up and place it in the glass.</p>
</blockquote>
<figure>
  <img alt="Step 2" src="http://arcturus-labs.com/blog/assets/visual_reasoning_is_on_its_way/step2.png" width="600px">
</figure>
<blockquote>
<p>Step 2: Put the marble in the glass.</p>
<p>In the image, the marble is now inside the glass, and the plate is empty.</p>
</blockquote>
<figure>
  <img alt="Step 3" src="http://arcturus-labs.com/blog/assets/visual_reasoning_is_on_its_way/step3.png" width="600px">
</figure>
<blockquote>
<p>Step 3: Turn the glass over onto the plate.</p>
<p>In the image, the glass is now upside down on the plate, trapping the marble inside.</p>
</blockquote>
<figure>
  <img alt="Step 4" src="http://arcturus-labs.com/blog/assets/visual_reasoning_is_on_its_way/step4.png" width="600px">
</figure>
<blockquote>
<p>Step 4: Pick the glass up.</p>
<p>In the image, the hand is lifting the glass off the plate. The marble remains on the plate, as it is no longer contained.</p>
</blockquote>
<figure>
  <img alt="Step 5" src="http://arcturus-labs.com/blog/assets/visual_reasoning_is_on_its_way/step5.png" width="600px">
</figure>
<blockquote>
<p>Step 5: Put the glass in the microwave.</p>
<p>In the image, the glass is now inside the microwave with the marble at the bottom.</p>
<p>Final answer: The marble is inside the microwave, at the bottom of the glass.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So... uh... notably, we made some amazingly consistent images, and then <em>completely</em> got the answer wrong. And we were so close! At Step 4, the model acknowledged that the marble was no longer contained in the glass. Unfortunately, by the time the glass was in the microwave, the model imagined that the marble had somehow followed it.</p>
<h3 id="training-models-to-think-visually">Training Models to Think Visually</h3>
<p>I think the failure to correctly use visual reasoning is because the model hasn't yet been <em>trained</em> for visual reasoning.</p>
<p>Who knows how OpenAI trained these models, but based on their <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-4o-image-generation/">debuting post</a>, the training to date is almost certainly unrelated to visual reasoning. The examples in that post – while extremely impressive – are about better rendering for text, and better instruction following. But all the instructions follow examples related to image manipulation rather than reasoning. Instead, we need to start training models <em>specifically</em> to perform visual reasoning.</p>
<p>For visual reasoning practice, we can do supervised fine-tuning on sequences similar to the marble example above. For instance, to understand more about the physical world, we can show the model sequential pictures of Slinkys going down stairs, or basketball players shooting 3-pointers, or people hammering birdhouses together. We can make the model become more socially aware by letting it see sequences of text and images from social interactions, and having it predict body language and facial expressions for the next scene. We can train for spatial reasoning by having models solve tangrams or having them visualize what a contraption will look like when rotated by 90 degrees. If you think for very long it's easy to can come up with tons of ideas like these – visual reasoning is central to most of our lives.</p>
<p>But where will we get all this training data? For spatial and physical reasoning tasks, we can leverage computer graphics to generate synthetic data. This approach is particularly valuable because simulations provide a controlled environment where we can create scenarios with known outcomes, making it easy to verify the model's predictions. But we'll also need real-world examples. Fortunately, there's an abundance of video content online that we can tap into. While initial datasets might require human annotation, soon models themselves will be able to process videos and their transcripts to extract training examples automatically. Consider all the how-to videos online - creators typically explain what they're going to do before demonstrating it. We can use these to create training pairs: given the current scene and verbal description, have models predict what happens next.</p>
<p>As an aside – I think that videos are going to be our richest source of new training data, and we're just now starting to really tap into it. But who owns the all of the video content on the web? YouTube... Google. I'd say that bodes really well for the future of the Gemini models. Wouldn't you?</p>
<h3 id="from-chain-of-thought-to-reasoning-models">From Chain-of-Thought to Reasoning Models</h3>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903">As early as 2022</a> we had recognized that LLMs profited from chain-of-thought reasoning. If a model was making a snap judgment and rushing to an incorrect solution, it was commonplace to add a "let's think step by step", hope for a better output, and often get it. Soon, deeper reasoning approaches were discovered. In particular, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10601">Tree of Thoughts</a> encouraged the model to think through multiple possible approaches for solving a problem, rank them according to perceived feasibility, and then the application would help direct the model optimally through the paths and toward the problem solution.</p>
<p>With OpenAI's o1 model and several models that followed soon thereafter, the ability to do this sort of tree-of-thoughts reasoning is baked into the model. Prior to providing a final solution, the model may now think through the problem within special "thinking" tags. According to DeepSeek (who has been much more transparent than OpenAI), their R1 model has been trained through a form of reinforcement learning with verifiable problems so that the model can be rewarded for efficiently thinking its way to the <em>verifiable</em> correct solution. Interestingly, and reminiscent of tree-of-thoughts, the models can think themselves into a corner – <em>recognize that they have messed up</em> – backtrack, and get back to a better course toward solving the problem.</p>
<p>Enter visual reasoning. In the coming year, models will undergo supervised fine-tuning to develop scene prediction abilities - given a current scene and a proposed change, they'll learn to visualize the outcome. For example, they'll be able to mentally rotate objects in 3D space or anticipate how people might react in social situations. As training progresses using scenarios with verifiable outcomes, models will develop more sophisticated reasoning capabilities. They'll be able to observe their environment, formulate plans, mentally simulate the consequences of different actions, and learn from comparing their predictions to real-world results. This advancement will be particularly transformative for robotics, where physical interaction with the environment requires robust visual understanding and planning.</p>
<p>Currently, there is one obvious problem with visual reasoning – image creation is a very slow process. However, like everything else in our world right now, this will soon become faster and more feasible. But even if the visual processing remains slow, the very act of training the models to reason about images will improve the text reasoning for visual/spatial problems. What's more, the internal representation of the images seems to be created at several levels of granularity – a small blurry image, and then a refined high-def image. The image you see when playing with ChatGPT is the latter, high-def image. Perhaps visual reasoning can make use of the blurry image – it will be quicker to generate and will help with the reasoning process.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I'm excited about what's coming! Just like every moment for the past 4 years, we're on the cusp of a radical discovery that will change our world – a radical discovery which is soon realized. I don't think this one is going to let us down. The ever-more capable <em>visual</em> reasoning models will be able to make better sense of our work – not only in terms of understanding the mechanics of physical objects, but also in reading social cues, and really in anything else that we do where vision is of use to us! And then 2026 will be the year of the robots...</p>

  <time datetime="2025-04-08T13:27:28+02:00">April 8, 2025</time>

  <p>
    <img src="https://livesys.se/posts/the-chroot-technique/liveusb.png" alt="Live USB stick">
</p>

<p>Ever ran into a Linux box that just won’t boot, even after making sure that
BIOS settings are OK and that no major hardware errors are at hand?</p>
<p>Then you need to know about the <code>chroot</code> technique, which can be a real life
saver.</p>
<p>For example, I managed to repair a <a href="https://nanoporetech.com/products/sequence/gridion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nanopore GridION device</a>

this way the other week, after the <a href="https://nanoporetech.com/document/gridion-user-manual#introduction-grid" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official method of re-installing it via an .iso file</a>

failed, which reminded me to make the effort of documenting these steps.</p>
<p>I came across the technique only after having used Linux as my daily driver for
more than a decade (thanks <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-lawson-9539ba166/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matt</a>
!), which means I
think it is worthy of much more attention, given its usefulness. Thus I’m
hoping to spread the word a bit through this post.</p>
<h2 id="tldr">TLDR</h2>
<p>In short, the idea is that if you can access the hard drive of a broken or
non-bootable Linux machine (this could be done e.g. by booting from a Live
USB-stick, or plugging in the hard-drive as an extra drive in another Linux
machine), you will mount this hard drive in a way that you trick your current
Linux session that this is the harddrive of the currently running system, which
it is not of course.</p>
<p>The trick to get this to work is to create a file tree based on two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>The hard drive partition of the broken system that was mounted as the <code>/</code> folder
on the host operating system.</li>
<li>A set of special system folders from the currently running, temporary,
operating system (the live stick or replacement computer), which are not
normal directories on the disk, but rather are containing system information
needed by the running linux system. These include <code>/sys</code>, <code>/proc</code> and a few
others, which we will go into details about below.</li>
</ol>
<p>Then what you do is that you run the <code>chroot</code> command on this newly assembled
folder structure, meaning that your currently running linux session will
replace its current file system with this new blend of folders, mostly from the
old, broken, hard drive.</p>
<p>It is a bit like hooking up a malfunctioning car to externally provided power
source so that you can at least access its instrumentation, check the mileage,
any error codes on the display etc.</p>
<p>Anyways, what this lets you do is then to run various commands that could
hopefully repair or diagnose your system, such as <code>apt upgrade</code>,
<code>dpkg-reconfigure</code> for broken packages on Debian based systems, or something
else, depending on the specifics of your system.</p>
<h2 id="the-process">The process</h2>
<p>It is good to have the full process for setting up the assembled folder
structure and doing the chroot, in one place, so that you can easily find it
when you need it.  Optimally you would even print out a small cheatsheet with
these commands, or have them stored in a text file on your “repair toolkit” USB
stick, or similar.</p>
<p>Anyways, below you will find all the steps of the process:</p>
<ol>
<li>Boot up your replacement OS (A live USB stick, or other computer with the broken
computer’s hard drive attached to it).</li>
<li>Figure out which partition on the broken system’s hard drive holds the root
file system, and which one holds the <code>/boot</code> folder.
<ul>
<li>I typically use <code>gparted</code> for that, which is available on most Ubuntu/Linux Mint
based live disks.</li>
<li>You can also use command-line based tools like <code>sudo fdisk -l</code></li>
<li>I typically try to mount each of the broken system’s partitions into the
file navigator (they typically show up as mountable drives in Thunar i
Linux Mint XFCE) to really make sure I select the right partition.</li>
<li>If you are not able to do that, you will have to do some guessing based on
filesystem size and type, whether they are already available in
<code>/etc/fstab</code> etc.</li>
<li>In this example, we will assume that the root folder is in partition:
<pre tabindex="0"><code>/dev/nvme0n1p5
</code></pre>… and that the <code>/boot</code> partition is in:
<pre tabindex="0"><code>/dev/nvme0n1p3
</code></pre>(These happen to be the case for the Nanopore GridION device I mentioned
that I repaired this way recently).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Create a folder somewhere in your currently running system’s file system, that will
act as the new root folder, as well as the <code>/boot</code> folder inside that:
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span>sudo mkdir /rescue
</span></span><span><span>sudo mkdir /rescue/boot
</span></span></code></pre></div></li>
<li>Mount the broken system’s main and boot partitions into these folders, e.g:
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span>sudo mount /dev/nvme0n1p5 /rescue
</span></span><span><span>sudo mount /dev/nvme0n1p3 /rescue/boot
</span></span></code></pre></div></li>
<li>Then, mount in the required special folders from your currently running
system, into the appropriate places in this new file structure (the <code>mount</code>
command is on the form <code>mount -t &lt;file-system-type&gt; -o &lt;options&gt; &lt;device&gt; &lt;mount-point&gt;</code>)
<pre tabindex="0"><code>sudo mount -t proc proc /rescue/proc
sudo mount -t sysfs sys /rescue/sys
sudo mount -o bind /dev /rescue/dev
sudo mount -t devpts pts /rescue/dev/pts
</code></pre></li>
<li>Now we are ready to <code>chroot</code>, or “change rootfolder” into this newly created
folder structure:
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span>chroot /rescue /bin/bash -i
</span></span></code></pre></div></li>
<li>And we’re done!</li>
</ol>
<p>Now you can look around in the file system to try to figure out what is causing
the system to not work, as well as use whatever file commands you need to try
to repair the broken system,</p>
<p>In our case with the broken GridION device, we found some broken symlinks and
empty <code>initrd.img-*</code> files in <code>/boot</code>, which indicated that a Linux Kernel
update had probably got interrupted mid-way through during a package update or
similar.</p>
<p>In this case, this was fixed by running <code>sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt upgrade</code>,
which complained about some broken packages, and suggested us to run <code>sudo dpkg-reconfigure</code> which finally fixed the problem.</p>

allow following them.</em></p><p>Frequent criticisms of man pages are “they don’t have links to each other” and
“they don’t re-flow if I make the window narrower”. These are perfectly valid
complains, but the reality is that man page do support these features: it’s the
programs that we use to read man pages that don’t implement them.</p><h2 id="the-format">The format<p>[<a href="#the-format">permalink</a>]</p></h2><p>Man pages are stored in the <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mdoc.7">mdoc(7)</a> format and in the legacy <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/man.7">man(7)</a>
format<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. The actual format for these files isn’t the easiest to read in
the world, but it’s definitely not worse than XML or JSON. mdoc has purely
semantic markup. A portion of an mdoc man page looks something like the
following<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="txt"><span><span>.Sh NAME

</span></span><span><span>.Sh SYNOPSIS
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In this case <code>.Sh</code>, <code>.Nm</code> and <code>.Nd</code> are macros which mark the following text as
“section header”, “document name” and “document description” respectively. If
you try to manually read or edit these files you’ll need the to consult the
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mdoc.7#MACRO_OVERVIEW">macro overview</a>.</p><h2 id="references-links">References (“links”)<p>[<a href="#references-links">permalink</a>]</p></h2><p>Two macros are of particular interest:</p><ul><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mdoc.7#Xr"><code>.Xr</code></a>: “Cross reference”: link to another manual page.</li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mdoc.7#Sx"><code>.Sx</code></a>: Reference to another section in the same manual page.</li></ul><p>Both of these can be rendered as links. In fact, when <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mdoc.7">mdoc(7)</a> pages are
converted into HTML, both of these macros are converted into actual links. Both
of the above linked manual pages include examples of this. The <code>.Sh</code> (section
header) macro renders as an anchor, so links can point to it directly.</p><p>Ironically, the documentation for <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mdoc.7">mdoc(7)</a> renders links when displayed as HTML
on a browser, but not when displayed in a terminal via the <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/man.1">man(1)</a> command.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<p>[<a href="#conclusion">permalink</a>]</p></h2><p>We need better man page readers.

easily add supports for links here: we need a pager which understands man pages
natively.</p><p>While we’re at it, we could also re-flow text when the terminal window is made

        How much do you think it costs to make a pair of Nike shoes in Asia? </p><p>

I'll show you. 🧵 <span><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GoC1DQ4bwAMlFZZ.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="Image" src="https://threadreaderapp.com/images/1px.png" data-src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GoC1DQ4bwAMlFZZ.jpg"></a></span>
        <sup><i></i></sup></p></div>
      <p>
        In 2014, Steve Bence served as Nike's Program Director in Footwear Sourcing and Manufacturing. He pulled back the curtain on manufacturing in an interview with Portland Business Journal. He said that, if a sneaker retails for $100, it generally costs them about $25 to manufacture <span><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GoC1LR5bYAACcaR.png" target="_blank"><img alt="Image" src="https://threadreaderapp.com/images/1px.png" data-src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GoC1LR5bYAACcaR.png"></a></span>
        <sup><i></i></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        This is the FOB cost. In the industry, "free on board" is the shoe's cost at the point when it's loaded onto a vessel at the port of origin. "Free" refers to how the factory will pay to deliver a finished product up to the point when it boards a ship—the rest is your problem. <span><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GoC5PvvaoAEtxp3.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="Image" src="https://threadreaderapp.com/images/1px.png" data-src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GoC5PvvaoAEtxp3.jpg"></a></span>
        <sup><i></i></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        Tariffs are calculated on the declared value of the import. In this imaginary case, if Nike paid a factory $25 to produce a pair of sneakers, then their tariff cost is $26. This roughly doubles the cost of making a pair of shoes in Asia and bringing it into the US (landed cost). <span><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GoC1vfrbwAE0EPN.png" target="_blank"><img alt="Image" src="https://threadreaderapp.com/images/1px.png" data-src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GoC1vfrbwAE0EPN.png"></a></span>
        <sup><i></i></sup>
      </p>
      <div id="tweet_5" data-controller="thread" data-action="click->thread#showTweet" data-screenname="dieworkwear" data-tweet="1909741178251276527" dir="auto"><p>
        "OK," you say, "so that leaves them with a $49 profit. $100 retail minus $25 manufacturing cost and $26 tariff. That's still good." </p><p>

Not so! There are other costs associated with getting that shoe into your closet. You are not collecting that sneaker at the port.
        <sup><i></i></sup></p></div>
      <p>
        In 2016, Sole Review took a look at Nike's income statement and came up with this breakdown. On an imaginary $100 shoe, they estimate manufacturing cost is $22. Add freight, insurance, and import taxes, they estimate it costs Nike $27 to bring that shoe from Asia to the US. <span><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GoC3qwUbwAAdd5b.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="Image" src="https://threadreaderapp.com/images/1px.png" data-src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GoC3qwUbwAAdd5b.jpg"></a></span>

      <div id="tweet_7" data-controller="thread" data-action="click->thread#showTweet" data-screenname="dieworkwear" data-tweet="1909741181757800851" dir="auto"><p>
        They also looked at Footlocker's income statement/ 10k filing and came up with this model. On the same imaginary $100 shoe, Footlocker makes $6 after expenses. </p><p>

Of course, Nike can retail the shoes themselves, but then they'll also take on similar business costs. <span><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GoC4WqUbwAMpSre.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="Image" src="https://threadreaderapp.com/images/1px.png" data-src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GoC4WqUbwAMpSre.jpg"></a></span>

        The actual costs associated with shoes will vary depending on the design, sourcing, and other specifics. The imaginary shoe above is set at $100 to make things easier as a percentage. For completeness, you can read Sole Review's story here:</p><p>

        From this model, you can see a few things. </p><p>

First, adding $26 tariff at the port doesn't just add $26 to the final price. Everything here works off of percentages. In this simple model, we say Nike has a landed cost of $25, sells it to Footlocker for $50, and they retail at $100 <span><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GoC8QCebwAAnqGv.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="Image" src="https://threadreaderapp.com/images/1px.png" data-src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GoC8QCebwAAnqGv.jpg"></a></span>
        <sup><i></i></sup></p></div>
      <p>
        But if we bump the cost of freight, insurance, and customs from $5 to, say, $28, then they wholesale the shoes to Footlocker for about $75. And if Footlocker purchases Nike shoes for $75, then they retail them for $150. Everyone needs to fixed percentages to avoid losses. <span><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GoC8_wtb0AAr-z1.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="Image" src="https://threadreaderapp.com/images/1px.png" data-src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GoC8_wtb0AAr-z1.jpg"></a></span>
        <sup><i></i></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        The second thing we see is that Asian manufacturing in Asia produces US jobs. You go to Footlocker to buy a pair of $100 shoes because you can afford them. This creates jobs for the Footlocker employees, Nike designers, marketing teams, and other US people throughout this chain. <span><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GoC9eB8bwAMtidR.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="Image" src="https://threadreaderapp.com/images/1px.png" data-src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GoC9eB8bwAMtidR.jpg"></a></span>
        <sup><i></i></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        The third thing we see is that Nike only paid the factory about $25 to make these sneakers. How much did it cost the factory to produce them? I don't have numbers on that, but if we assume the usual turnkey model, then maybe $12.5? And how much of that went to the worker? <span><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GoC-LjVbwAILWod.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="Image" src="https://threadreaderapp.com/images/1px.png" data-src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GoC-LjVbwAILWod.jpg"></a></span>
        <sup><i></i></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        Again, it's a popular misconception that all overseas production is sweatshops. Production can be done ethically abroad and still be relatively cheap because the cost of living is not the same everywhere. I encourage you to note assume that every Asian worker is a slave.

        We have some idea of how much it would cost to make sneakers in the US. Victory/ Hersey (before they closed), SAS, and certain New Balances are made here. They retail for about $220.</p><p>

Note, many of these rely on imported materials (up to 30%). So they will go up with tariffs. <span><span><span><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GoC_8aSbwAQVpWj.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="Image" src="https://threadreaderapp.com/images/1px.png" data-src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GoC_8aSbwAQVpWj.jpg"></a></span></span><br>

        <sup><i></i></sup></p></div>
      <p>
        I think making shoes is a perfectly fine job, although it suffers from the same problem as other manufacturing jobs. As the US has switched to a post-industrial economy, a lot of the wage growth has been in knowledge intensive services—medicine, law, engineering.
        <sup><i></i></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        That means the Nike designer and marketer typically see more wage growth year-after-year than someone working on the manufacturing line (especially if they're not unionized and can leverage collective bargaining power). <span><span><span><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GoDA0EzbwAU0vRx.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="Image" src="https://threadreaderapp.com/images/1px.png" data-src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GoDA0EzbwAU0vRx.jpg"></a></span></span><br>

        Tech optimists think that technology will make factory jobs easier and better for workers. I'm less sanguine. I think some tech improves productivity and wages; other types of tech deskills and eliminates jobs (look at AI with illustration art).</p><p>

      <p>
        I raise this only because I see some people suggest that it only costs Nike $2 to make a pair of sneakers in Asian sweatshops, which retail on the shelf for $150, and this is $148 profit. And if we move this back to the US, American workers can capture some of that money.
        <sup><i></i></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        I think the truth is much more complicated. Manufacturing overseas can create certain jobs here by offering a more affordable product. In the end, you may actually see a *loss* of US jobs as fewer people pay for $220 sneakers, both at home and abroad. <span><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GoDCJMZbwAE-usv.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="Image" src="https://threadreaderapp.com/images/1px.png" data-src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GoDCJMZbwAE-usv.jpg"></a></span>

          <div><p>"China makes crappy clothes anyway, so who cares?"</p><p>

This is a very outdated view. Let me show you just one shop in Beijing, which I think makes clothes that surpasses Loro Piana, The Row, or whatever luxury ready-to-wear brand you can name. 🧵 <span><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gn_JKIWaEAAMxXJ.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="Image" src="https://threadreaderapp.com/images/1px.png" data-src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gn_JKIWaEAAMxXJ.jpg"></a></span></p></div>
          <p>Atelier BRIO Pechino started as a multi-brand store that held trunk shows with bespoke tailors and shoemakers from around the world. Over time, they've developed as their own tailoring house, which I think excels bc of the proprietor's high taste and their craftspeople's skills. <span><span><span><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gn_LNYvbwAEDgJL.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="Image" src="https://threadreaderapp.com/images/1px.png" data-src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gn_LNYvbwAEDgJL.jpg"></a></span></span><br>

          <p>For example, on the right is your typical hand padded lapel, where a tailor has picked up multiple layers of material with needle and thread, and shaped them through stitches. This is sort of workmanship is pretty standard, even on Savile Row. <span><span><span><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gn_MiB_bwAAgb0h.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="Image" src="https://threadreaderapp.com/images/1px.png" data-src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gn_MiB_bwAAgb0h.jpg"></a></span></span><br>

          <p>I support the US garment industry. I don't believe in making life harder for immigrants or erecting crazy high tariffs. So how can we reshore some of our US garment manufacturing without xenophobia or protectionism? Here's my view. 🧵 <span><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gn4IyZCaUAA8V-k.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="Image" src="https://threadreaderapp.com/images/1px.png" data-src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gn4IyZCaUAA8V-k.jpg"></a></span></p>
          <div><p>This thread starts with three ideas:</p><p>

First, garment manufacturing has always been done by immigrants—first Germans in the late 19th century, then Jewish immigrants from East Europe, then Italian and Polish, and now East Asian, Latin, and Caribbean. <span><span><span><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gn4LNu-aQAACxqE.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="Image" src="https://threadreaderapp.com/images/1px.png" data-src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gn4LNu-aQAACxqE.jpg"></a></span></span><br>

          <p>Such immigrants gave us our cultural language. The soft-shouldered Ivy style look—popularly associated with WASPs—was formed by Jewish tailors. One of the leading shops for this look, J. Press, was founded by a Latvian immigrant who eschewed rabbinical studies to sell clothes. <span><span><span><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gn4Kj1XbIAExT6t.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="Image" src="https://threadreaderapp.com/images/1px.png" data-src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gn4Kj1XbIAExT6t.jpg"></a></span></span><br>

Long ago, before the advent of ready-to-wear, tailors made things by hand, some using a pad stitch.</p><p>

          <p>As you can see in that video, a pad stitch is a way to pick up multiple pieces of fabric, shaping the material as you go and turning 2D cloth into 3D form.

          <p>People often equate Chinese manufacturing with low quality, cheap, sweatshop clothes. And they assume that US manufacturing is high quality, ethically made clothes.

          <div><p>Any time I comment on these shoes, someone replies: "What am I supposed to wear? Those are so comfy!" </p><p>

This is reasonable. But if you want to wear more traditional footwear, here are some suggestions on how to find a comfortable pair. 🧵 <span><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GnflAP8aUAAEEYe.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="Image" src="https://threadreaderapp.com/images/1px.png" data-src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GnflAP8aUAAEEYe.jpg"></a></span></p></div>
          <p>First, nothing is going to be as comfy as sneakers. Those are pillows built on marshmallow clouds. But it's also not true that traditional leather shoes have to be painful. For generations, men wore leather soles for sport and long walks. <span><span><span><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gnfo1MfaIAArz-M.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="Image" src="https://threadreaderapp.com/images/1px.png" data-src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gnfo1MfaIAArz-M.jpg"></a></span></span><br>

          <p>In fact, John Lobb of St. James in London still calls some of their derbies "navvy cut." The term navvy is short for navigator, which is a working class laborer during the 19th century who worked on civil engineering projects, such as canals and railways. <span><span><span><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GnfpXAxbkAAgzZh.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="Image" src="https://threadreaderapp.com/images/1px.png" data-src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GnfpXAxbkAAgzZh.jpg"></a></span></span><br>

<p>I have to put my hands up — when Tesla acquired SolarCity in 2016, I supported the decision. Yes, Elon Musk was chairman of both companies. Yes, it was his cousins who were CEO and CTO, and had founded the company based on a suggestion from Elon Musk at Burning Man. Yes, Tesla was saving SolarCity financially in key ways. Nonetheless, I thought there was superb synergy between the companies and huge potential for more solar sales through the Tesla brand, sales network, and customer base.</p>
<p>Since then, Tesla has done some good stuff, but I have to say that I’ve been very disappointed in Tesla’s rather mild, disconnected, and overall lame efforts to sell more rooftop solar power.</p>
<p>Something I noticed a while back proved the point. Tesla’s quarterly rooftop solar power installations started dropping, and dropping, and dropping. At some point, I realized this had gone from an up &amp; down segment of Tesla’s business to a long-term, significant decline.</p>
<p>I decided to go back and actually see how long Tesla had been seeing its solar business decline. Unfortunately, the findings weren’t uplifting. After it’s “last good quarter,” the 4th quarter of 2022, when 100 megawatts (MW) of solar power were installed, Tesla’s rooftop solar installations declined for at least 4 consecutive quarters. The company published the numbers for those 4 quarters, but then, in the next quarter, <a href="https://digitalassets.tesla.com/tesla-contents/image/upload/IR/TSLA-Q1-2024-Update.pdf">Q1 2024</a>, Tesla simply lamented that its solar installations had declined year over year but stopped publishing those figures. Presumably, the rooftop solar sales decline continued — otherwise, Tesla would have highlighted a return to growth. But we just can’t be certain of that in every quarter.</p>

<p><a href="https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Tesla-Solar-deployments-by-quarter-line-graph-logo.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Tesla-Solar-deployments-by-quarter-line-graph-logo.png" alt="" width="1640" height="928" srcset="https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Tesla-Solar-deployments-by-quarter-line-graph-logo.png 1640w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Tesla-Solar-deployments-by-quarter-line-graph-logo-400x226.png 400w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Tesla-Solar-deployments-by-quarter-line-graph-logo-800x453.png 800w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Tesla-Solar-deployments-by-quarter-line-graph-logo-768x435.png 768w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Tesla-Solar-deployments-by-quarter-line-graph-logo-1536x869.png 1536w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1640px) 100vw, 1640px"></a></p>
<p>In the “Assets” section of Tesla’s quarterly financial reports, the company does still publish “Solar energy systems, net.” And the totals for that have continued to decline in every quarter since then. So, if we presume continued quarter-over-quarter declines in solar power installations, that would be 8 straight quarters of decline (not making a judgement on Q1 2025 yet, but I’m not hopeful about that quarter either).</p>
<p>Aside from recent quarters, if you look at the full chart and graph above, it certainly stands out that Tesla’s solar installations have dropped off a cliff compared to where they were right after the SolarCity acquisition. In Q4 2016, 201 MW of solar power were installed. In Q1 2017, 150 MW were installed. In Q2 2017, 176 MW were installed. And then Tesla never got close to those figures again. In Q3 2017, 109 MW of solar power were installed, and Tesla has only broken 100 MW of new solar power capacity in a quarter twice since then.</p>
<p>The trend in those four quarters of 2023 — the last quarters Tesla published that data for — was bad, very had. If that trend continued in 2024, we have to assume Tesla’s solar business is a shell of what it was several (or even a few) years ago.</p>
<p>This is horrible to see for anyone cheering on cleantech growth. Much more solar power needs to be installed, and a massive slowdown in solar installations from a large company like Tesla just doesn’t make sense to me. Even not trying hard, it seems like the company should be able to find many customers ready to take the solar plunge.</p>
<p><em>Here’s the above chart and graph again in interactive form (best viewed on a real computer, not a phone):</em></p>

When he was interviewed over video last month, however, Pindrop's recruiter noticed that Ivan's facial expressions were slightly out of sync with his words.</p><p>That's because the candidate, whom the firm has since dubbed "Ivan X," was a scammer using deepfake software and other generative AI tools in a bid to get hired by the tech company, said Pindrop CEO and co-founder <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/vijay-balasubramaniyan" target="_blank">Vijay Balasubramaniyan</a>.</p><p>"Gen AI has blurred the line between what it is to be human and what it means to be machine," Balasubramaniyan said. "What we're seeing is that individuals are using these fake identities and fake faces and fake voices to secure employment, even sometimes going so far as doing a face swap with another individual who shows up for the job."</p><p>Companies have long fought off attacks from hackers hoping to exploit vulnerabilities in their software, employees or vendors. Now, another threat has emerged: Job candidates who aren't who they say they are, wielding AI tools to fabricate photo IDs, generate employment histories and provide answers during interviews.</p><p>The rise of AI-generated profiles means that by 2028 globally 1 in 4 job candidates will be fake, according to research and advisory firm Gartner.</p><p>The risk to a company from bringing on a fake job seeker can vary, depending on the person's intentions. Once hired, the impostor can install malware to demand ransom from a company, or steal its customer data, trade secrets or funds, according to Balasubramaniyan. In many cases, the deceitful employees are simply collecting a salary that they wouldn't otherwise be able to, he said.</p></div><h2><a id="headline0"></a>'Massive' increase</h2><div><p>Cybersecurity and cryptocurrency firms have seen a recent surge in fake job seekers, industry experts told CNBC. As the companies are often hiring for remote roles, they present valuable targets for bad actors, these people said.</p><p>Ben Sesser, the CEO of BrightHire, said he first heard of the issue a year ago and that the number of fraudulent job candidates has "ramped up massively" this year. His company helps more than 300 corporate clients in finance, tech and health care assess prospective employees in video interviews.</p><p>"Humans are generally the weak link in cybersecurity, and the hiring process is an inherently human process with a lot of hand-offs and a lot of different people involved," Sesser said. "It's become a weak point that folks are trying to expose."</p><p>But the issue isn't confined to the tech industry. More than 300 U.S. firms inadvertently hired impostors with ties to North Korea for IT work, including a major national television network, a defense manufacturer, an automaker, and other Fortune 500 companies, the Justice Department <a href="https://www.justice.gov/archives/usao-dc/media/1352191/dl" target="_blank">alleged</a> in May.</p><p>The workers used stolen American identities to apply for remote jobs and deployed remote networks and other techniques to mask their true locations, the DOJ said. They ultimately sent millions of dollars in wages to North Korea to help fund the nation's weapons program, the Justice Department alleged.</p><p>That case, involving a ring of alleged enablers including an American <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/national-security/american-it-scammer-helped-north-korea-fund-nuclear-weapons-program-u-s-says-65430aa7" target="_blank">citizen</a>, exposed a small part of what U.S. authorities have said is a sprawling overseas network of thousands of IT workers with North Korean ties. The DOJ has since filed more <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/12/north-koreans-charged-identity-theft-extortion-conspiracy-doj.html">cases</a> involving North Korean IT workers.</p></div><h2><a id="headline1"></a>A growth industry</h2><div><p>Fake job seekers aren't letting up, if the experience of Lili Infante, founder and chief executive of CAT Labs, is any indication. Her Florida-based startup sits at the intersection of cybersecurity and cryptocurrency, making it especially alluring to bad actors.</p><p>"Every time we list a job posting, we get 100 North Korean spies applying to it," Infante said. "When you look at their resumes, they look amazing; they use all the keywords for what we're looking for."</p><p>Infante said her firm leans on an identity-verification company to weed out fake candidates, part of an emerging sector that includes firms such as iDenfy, Jumio and Socure.</p></div><div id="ArticleBody-InlineImage-108075310" data-test="InlineImage"><p>An FBI wanted poster shows suspects the agency said are IT workers from North Korea, officially called the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.</p><p>Source: FBI</p></div><div><p>The fake employee industry has broadened beyond North Koreans in recent years to include criminal groups located in Russia, China, Malaysia and South Korea, according to Roger Grimes, a veteran computer security consultant.</p><p>Ironically, some of these fraudulent workers would be considered top performers at most companies, he said.</p><p>"Sometimes they'll do the role poorly, and then sometimes they perform it so well that I've actually had a few people tell me they were sorry they had to let them go," Grimes said.</p><p>His employer, the cybersecurity firm KnowBe4, said in October that it <a href="https://blog.knowbe4.com/how-a-north-korean-fake-it-worker-tried-to-infiltrate-us" target="_blank">inadvertently hired</a> a North Korean software engineer.</p><p>The worker used AI to alter a stock photo, combined with a valid but stolen U.S. identity, and got through background checks, including four video interviews, the firm said. He was only discovered after the company found suspicious activity coming from his account.</p></div><h2><a id="headline2"></a>Fighting deepfakes</h2><div><p>Despite the DOJ case and a few other publicized incidents, hiring managers at most companies are generally unaware of the risks of fake job candidates, according to BrightHire's Sesser.</p><p>"They're responsible for talent strategy and other important things, but being on the front lines of security has historically not been one of them," he said. "Folks think they're not experiencing it, but I think it's probably more likely that they're just not realizing that it's going on."</p><p>As the quality of deepfake technology improves, the issue will be harder to avoid, Sesser said.</p><p>As for "Ivan X," Pindrop's Balasubramaniyan said the startup used a new video authentication program it created to confirm he was a deepfake fraud.</p><p>While Ivan claimed to be located in western Ukraine, his IP address indicated he was actually from thousands of miles to the east, in a possible Russian military facility near the North Korean border, the company said.</p><p>Pindrop, backed by Andreessen Horowitz and Citi Ventures, was founded more than a decade ago to detect fraud in voice interactions, but may soon pivot to video authentication. Clients include some of the biggest U.S. banks, insurers and health companies.</p><p>"We are no longer able to trust our eyes and ears," Balasubramaniyan said. "Without technology, you're worse off than a monkey with a random coin toss."</p></div><div id="Placeholder-ArticleBody-Video-108113235" data-test="VideoPlaceHolder" role="region" tabindex="0" data-vilynx-id="7000369085" aria-labelledby="Placeholder-ArticleBody-Video-108113235"><p><img src="https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108113236-17416049691741604965-38826472875-1080pnbcnews.jpg?v=1741604968&amp;w=750&amp;h=422&amp;vtcrop=y" alt="AI generated deepfake scam is 'phishing with a twist', says Fortalice Solutions CEO Theresa Payton"><span></span><span></span></p></div></div></div>]]></description>

    <h2 data-block-key="uz955"><b>A new era of Agent Interoperability</b></h2><p data-block-key="a7i7i"><br>AI agents offer a unique opportunity to help people be more productive by autonomously handling many daily recurring or complex tasks. Today, enterprises are increasingly building and deploying autonomous agents to help scale, automate and enhance processes throughout the workplace–from ordering new laptops, to aiding customer service representatives, to assisting in supply chain planning.</p><p data-block-key="ed022">To maximize the benefits from agentic AI, it is critical for these agents to be able to collaborate in a dynamic, multi-agent ecosystem across siloed data systems and applications. Enabling agents to interoperate with each other, even if they were built by different vendors or in a different framework, will increase autonomy and multiply productivity gains, while lowering long-term costs.</p><p data-block-key="81mkl"><b><br>Today, we’re launching a new, open protocol called Agent2Agent (A2A), with support and contributions from more than 50 technology partners</b> like Atlassian, Box, Cohere, Intuit, Langchain, MongoDB, PayPal, Salesforce, SAP, ServiceNow, UKG and Workday; and leading service providers including Accenture, BCG, Capgemini, Cognizant, Deloitte, HCLTech, Infosys, KPMG, McKinsey, PwC, TCS, and Wipro. The A2A protocol will allow AI agents to communicate with each other, securely exchange information, and coordinate actions on top of various enterprise platforms or applications. We believe the A2A framework will add significant value for customers, whose AI agents will now be able to work across their entire enterprise application estates.</p><p data-block-key="fj6eh">This collaborative effort signifies a shared vision of a future when AI agents, regardless of their underlying technologies, can seamlessly collaborate to automate complex enterprise workflows and drive unprecedented levels of efficiency and innovation.</p><p data-block-key="e5t9f">A2A is an open protocol that complements Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP), which provides helpful tools and context to agents. Drawing on Google's internal expertise in scaling agentic systems, we designed the A2A protocol to address the challenges we identified in deploying large-scale, multi-agent systems for our customers. A2A empowers developers to build agents capable of connecting with any other agent built using the protocol and offers users the flexibility to combine agents from various providers. Critically, businesses benefit from a standardized method for managing their agents across diverse platforms and cloud environments. We believe this universal interoperability is essential for fully realizing the potential of collaborative AI agents.</p>

    <h2 data-block-key="uz955">A2A design principles</h2><p data-block-key="7g8qj">A2A is an open protocol that provides a standard way for agents to collaborate with each other, regardless of the underlying framework or vendor. While designing the protocol with our partners, we adhered to five key principles:</p><ul><li data-block-key="669ia"><b>Embrace agentic capabilities</b>: A2A focuses on enabling agents to collaborate in their natural, unstructured modalities, even when they don’t share memory, tools and context. We are enabling true multi-agent scenarios without limiting an agent to a “tool.”</li></ul><ul><li data-block-key="2bio"><b>Build on existing standards:</b> The protocol is built on top of existing, popular standards including HTTP, SSE, JSON-RPC, which means it’s easier to integrate with existing IT stacks businesses already use daily.</li></ul><ul><li data-block-key="dqt8r"><b>Secure by default</b>: A2A is designed to support enterprise-grade authentication and authorization, with parity to OpenAPI’s authentication schemes at launch.</li></ul><ul><li data-block-key="beafe"><b>Support for long-running tasks:</b> We designed A2A to be flexible and support scenarios where it excels at completing everything from quick tasks to deep research that may take hours and or even days when humans are in the loop. Throughout this process, A2A can provide real-time feedback, notifications, and state updates to its users.</li></ul><ul><li data-block-key="1hlhc"><b>Modality agnostic:</b> The agentic world isn’t limited to just text, which is why we’ve designed A2A to support various modalities, including audio and video streaming.</li></ul><h2 data-block-key="fc9ut"><b><br></b>How A2A works</h2>

    <p data-block-key="uz955">A2A facilitates communication between a "client" agent and a “remote” agent. A client agent is responsible for formulating and communicating tasks, while the remote agent is responsible for acting on those tasks in an attempt to provide the correct information or take the correct action. This interaction involves several key capabilities:</p><ul><li data-block-key="2h8en"><b>Capability discovery:</b> Agents can advertise their capabilities using an “Agent Card” in JSON format, allowing the client agent to identify the best agent that can perform a task and leverage A2A to communicate with the remote agent.</li></ul><ul><li data-block-key="7sco4"><b>Task management:</b> The communication between a client and remote agent is oriented towards task completion, in which agents work to fulfill end-user requests. This “task” object is defined by the protocol and has a lifecycle. It can be completed immediately or, for long-running tasks, each of the agents can communicate to stay in sync with each other on the latest status of completing a task. The output of a task is known as an “artifact.”</li></ul><ul><li data-block-key="do4ld"><b>Collaboration:</b> Agents can send each other messages to communicate context, replies, artifacts, or user instructions.</li></ul><ul><li data-block-key="aspve"><b>User experience negotiation:</b> Each message includes “parts,” which is a fully formed piece of content, like a generated image. Each part has a specified content type, allowing client and remote agents to negotiate the correct format needed and explicitly include negotiations of the user’s UI capabilities–e.g., iframes, video, web forms, and more.</li></ul><p data-block-key="c4pm3">See the full details of how the protocol works in our <a href="https://github.com/google/A2A">draft specification</a>.</p><h2 data-block-key="48qd1"><b><br></b>A real-world example: candidate sourcing</h2>

    <p data-block-key="uz955">Hiring a software engineer can be significantly simplified with A2A collaboration. Within a unified interface like Agentspace, a user (e.g., a hiring manager) can task their agent to find candidates matching a job listing, location, and skill set. The agent then interacts with other specialized agents to source potential candidates. The user receives these suggestions and can then direct their agent to schedule further interviews, streamlining the candidate sourcing process. After the interview process completes, another agent can be engaged to facilitate background checks. This is just one example of how AI agents need to collaborate across systems to source a qualified job candidate.</p><h2 data-block-key="8afkp"><br>The future of agent interoperability</h2><p data-block-key="clhb9">A2A has the potential to unlock a new era of agent interoperability, fostering innovation and creating more powerful and versatile agentic systems.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://stratechery.com/2025/american-disruption/">https://stratechery.com/2025/american-disruption/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43631276">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>




<p>I have a few informal guidelines that govern my writing on Stratechery, including “Don’t post more than one front-page Article a week”, “Don’t talk about my writing process”, and “Don’t start Articles with ‘I’”; it’s an extraordinary week, though, so I’m breaking a few rules.</p>



<p>There are three old Stratechery Articles that, after reflection, missed the mark in different ways.</p>



<ul>
<li>The most proximate cause for my rule-breaking was Monday’s <a href="https://stratechery.com/2025/trade-tariffs-and-tech/">Trade, Tariffs, and Tech</a>; I stand by everything I wrote, but it was incomplete, lacking an overall framework and satisfying conclusion. That’s not surprising given the current uncertainty, but that means I should have waited to publish a front-page Article until I had more clarity (I do much more musing in my Updates, which that Article is now categorized as). Now I have to break my rule and write another Article.</li>



<li>The second Article to revisit is November’s <a href="https://stratechery.com/2024/a-chance-to-build/">A Chance to Build</a>. This Article was in fact deeply pessimistic about President Trump’s promised trade regime, particularly in terms of what it meant for tech; the title and conclusion, however, tried to find some positives. Clearly that was a mistake; that Article was predictive of what was happening, but I obscured the prediction.</li>



<li>The third Article to revisit is January 2021’s <a href="https://stratechery.com/2021/internet-3-0-and-the-beginning-of-tech-history/">Internet 3.0 and the Beginning of (Tech) History</a>. This Article was right about tech exiting an economically-defined era — the Aggregation era — and entering a new politically-defined era. It was, however, four years too early, and misdiagnosed the reason for the transition. The driver is not foreign countries closing their doors to America; it’s America closing its door to the world.</li>
</ul>



<p>The proximate cause of all of this reflection is of course Trump’s disastrous “liberation day” tariffs. The secondary cause is what I wrote about Monday: the U.S. has a genuine problem on its hands thanks to its inability to make things pertinent to modern warfare and high tech. The root cause, however, is very much in Stratechery’s wheelhouse, and worthy of another Article: it’s disruption.</p>



<h3>The Disruption of American Manufacturing</h3>



<p>The late Professor Clayton Christensen — <a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/clayton-christensen-passes-away-professor-christensen-and-i-kobe-bryant-and-measuring-your-life/">one of my personal heroes and inspirations</a> — coined the term disruption in a seminal paper called <a href="http://hbr.org/1995/01/disruptive-technologies-catching-the-wave/">Disruptive Technologies: Catching the Wave</a>, which he expanded to book-length in <a href="http://www.claytonchristensen.com/books/the-innovators-dilemma/">The Innovator’s Dilemma</a>. However, Christensen’s most concise summary comes from <a href="https://hbr.org/2015/12/what-is-disruptive-innovation">this 20-year retrospective in Harvard Business Review</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Disruption” describes a process whereby a smaller company with fewer resources is able to successfully challenge established incumbent businesses. Specifically, as incumbents focus on improving their products and services for their most demanding (and usually most profitable) customers, they exceed the needs of some segments and ignore the needs of others. Entrants that prove disruptive begin by successfully targeting those overlooked segments, gaining a foothold by delivering more-suitable functionality—frequently at a lower price. Incumbents, chasing higher profitability in more-demanding segments, tend not to respond vigorously. Entrants then move upmarket, delivering the performance that incumbents’ mainstream customers require, while preserving the advantages that drove their early success. When mainstream customers start adopting the entrants’ offerings in volume, disruption has occurred.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This is almost a perfect summary of what has happened in manufacturing, and, as I noted <a href="https://stratechery.com/2024/a-chance-to-build/">in that November article</a>, it started with chips:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>That history starts in 1956, when William Shockley founded the Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory to commercialize the transistor that he had helped invent at Bell Labs; he chose Mountain View to be close to his ailing mother. A year later the so-called “Traitorous Eight”, led by Robert Noyce, left and founded Fairchild Semiconductor down the road. Six years after that Fairchild Semiconductor opened a facility in Hong Kong to assemble and test semiconductors. Assembly required manually attaching wires to a semiconductor chip, a labor-intensive and monotonous task that was difficult to do economically with American wages, which ran about $2.50/hour; Hong Kong wages were a tenth of that. Four years later Texas Instruments opened a facility in Taiwan, where wages were $0.19/hour; two years after that Fairchild Semiconductor opened another facility in Singapore, where wages were $0.11/hour.</p>



<p>In other words, you can make the case that the classic story of Silicon Valley isn’t completely honest. Chips did have marginal costs, but that marginal cost was, within single digit years of the founding of Silicon Valley, exported to Asia.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Notice what did still happen in the United States, at least back then: actual chip fabrication. <em>That</em> was where innovation happened, and where margins were captured, so of course U.S. chip companies kept that for themselves. It was the tedious and labor-intensive assembly and testing that was available to poor Asian economies led by authoritarian governments eager to provide some sort of alternative to communism.</p>



<p>One important point about new market disruption — which Asian manufacturing was — is that it is downstream of a technological change that fundamentally changes cost structures. In the case of the Asian manufacturing market, there were actually three; from 2016’s <a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/the-brexit-possibility/">The Brexit Possibility</a>:</p>

<p>In the years leading up to the 1970s, three technological advances completely transformed the meaning of globalization:</p>



<ul>
<li>In 1963 Boeing produced the 707-320B, the first jet airliner capable of non-stop service from the continental United States to Asia; in 1970 the 747 made this routine.</li>



<li>In 1964 the first transpacific telephone cable between the United States and Japan was completed; over the next several years it would be extended throughout Asia.</li>



<li>In 1968 ISO 668 standardized shipping containers, dramatically increasing the efficiency with which goods could be shipped over the ocean in particular.</li>
</ul>



<p>These three factors in combination, for the first time, enabled a new kind of trade. Instead of manufacturing products in the United States (or Europe or Japan or anywhere else) and trading them to other countries, multinational corporations could invert themselves: design products in their home markets, then communicate those designs to factories in other countries, and ship finished products back to their domestic market. And, thanks to the dramatically lower wages in Asia (supercharged by China’s opening in 1978), it was immensely profitable to do just that.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Christensen, somewhat confusingly, actually has two theories of disruption; the other one is called “low-end disruption”, but it is also pertinent to this story. From <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1578518520/">The Innovator’s Solution</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<figure><img data-recalc-dims="1" fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="958" height="872" src="https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/american-disruption-1.png?resize=958%2C872&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/american-disruption-1.png?w=958&amp;ssl=1 958w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/american-disruption-1.png?resize=300%2C273&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/american-disruption-1.png?resize=768%2C699&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 958px) 100vw, 958px"></figure>



<p>The pressure of competing along this new trajectory of improvement [(speed, convenience, and customization)] forces a gradual evolution in product architecture, as depicted in Figure 5-1 — away from the interdependent, proprietary architectures that had the advantage in the not-good-enough era toward modular designs in the era of performance surplus. Modular architectures help companies to compete on the dimensions that matter in the lower-right portions of the disruption diagram. Companies can introduce new products faster because they can upgrade individual subsystems without having to redesign everything. Although standard interfaces invariably force compromise in system performance, firms have the slack to trade away some performance with these customers because functionality is more than good enough.</p>



<p>Modularity has a profound impact on industry structure because it enables independent, nonintegrated organizations to sell, buy, and assemble components and subsystems. Whereas in the interdependent world you had to make all of the key elements of the system in order to make any of them, in a modular world you can prosper by outsourcing or by supplying just one element. Ultimately, the specifications for modular interfaces will coalesce as industry standards. When that happens, companies can mix and match components from best-of-breed suppliers in order to respond conveniently to the specific needs of individual customers. As depicted in Figure 5-1, these nonintegrated competitors disrupt the integrated leader.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This is exactly what happened to categories like PCs: everything became modular, commoditized, and low margin — and thus followed chip test and assembly to Asia. One aspect that was under-discussed in Christensen’s theory, however, was scale, which mattered more than the customization point. It was less important that a customer be able to use any chip they wanted than it was that a lot of customers wanted to use the same chip. Moreover, this scale point applied up-and-down the stack, to both components and assemblers.</p>



<p>Note also the importance of scale to the new market disruption above: while outsourcing got easier thanks to technology, it’s difficult to be easier than working locally; the best way to overcome those coordination costs is to operate at scale. This helps explain why manufacturing in Asia is fundamentally different than the manufacturing we remember in the United States decades ago: instead of firms with product-specific factories, China has flexible factories that accommodate all kinds of orders, delivering on that vector of speed, convenience, and customization that Christensen talked about.</p>



<p>This scale has, as I noted last November, been particularly valuable for tech companies; software scales to the world, and Asian factories, particularly Chinese ones, scale with it, providing the hardware complements to American software. That is why every single tech company — even software ones — are damaged by these tariffs; more expensive complements means lower usage overall.</p>



<p>The other scale point that is particularly pertinent to technology is chips. Every decrease in node size comes at increasingly astronomical costs; the best way to afford those costs is to have one entity making chips for everyone, and that has turned out to be TSMC. Indeed, one way to understand Intel’s struggles is that it was actually one of the last massive integrated manufacturers: Intel made chips almost entirely for itself. However, once the company missed mobile, <a href="https://stratechery.com/2021/intel-problems/">it had no choice but to switch to a foundry model</a>; the company is trying now, but really <a href="https://stratechery.com/2013/the-intel-opportunity/">should have started fifteen years ago</a>. Now the company is stuck, and <a href="https://stratechery.com/2024/intel-honesty/">I think they will need government help</a>.</p>



<h3>iPhone Jobs</h3>



<p>There is one other very important takeaway from disruption: companies that go up-market find it impossible to go back down, and I think this too applies to countries. Start with the theory: Christensen had a chapter in <em>The Innovator’s Dilemma</em> entitled “What Goes Up, Can’t Go Down”:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Three factors — the promise of upmarket margins, the simultaneous upmarket movement of many of a company’s customers, and the difficulty of cutting costs to move downmarket profitably — together create powerful barriers to downward mobility. In the internal debates about resource allocation for new product development, therefore, proposals to pursue disruptive technologies generally lose out to proposals to move upmarket. In fact, cultivating a systematic approach to weeding out new product development initiatives that would likely lower profits is one of the most important achievements of any well-managed company.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Now consider this in the context of the United States: every single job in this country, even at the obsolete federal minimum wage of $7.25/hour, makes much more money than an iPhone factory line worker. And, critically, we have basically full employment; that is what makes this statement from White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt ridiculous; from <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/04/08/trump-thinks-the-us-has-the-resources-needed-to-make-iphones/">9to5Mac</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>In response to a question from Maggie Haberman of The New York Times about the types of jobs Trump hopes to create in the U.S. with these tariffs, Leavitt said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“The president wants to increase manufacturing jobs here in the United States of America, but he’s also looking at advanced technologies. He’s also looking at AI and emerging fields that are growing around the world that the United States needs to be a leader in as well. There’s an array of diverse jobs. More traditional manufacturing jobs, and also jobs in advanced technologies. The president is looking at all of those. He wants them to come back home.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Haberman followed up with a question about iPhone manufacturing specifically, asking whether Trump thinks this is “the kind of technology” that could move to the United States. Leavitt responded:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“[Trump] believes we have the labor, we have the workforce, we have the resources to do it. As you know, Apple has invested $500 billion here in the United States. So, if Apple didn’t think the United States could do it, they probably wouldn’t have put up that big chunk of change.”</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>



<p>So could Apple pay more to get U.S. workers? I suppose — leaving aside the questions of skills and whatnot — but there is also the question of desirability; the iPhone assembly work that is not automated is highly drudgerous, sitting in a factory for hours a day delicately assembling the same components over and over again. It’s a good job if the alternative is working in the fields or in a much more dangerous and uncomfortable factory, but it’s much worse than basically any sort of job that is available in the U.S. market.</p>



<p>At the same time, it is important to note that this drudgerous final assembly work is a center of gravity for the components that actually need to be assembled, and these parts are all of significantly higher value, and far more likely to be produced through automation. <a href="https://stratechery.com/2025/apples-china-problem-apple-in-the-short-term-techs-complement-risk/">As I noted yesterday</a>, Apple has probably done more than any other company to move China up the curve in terms of the ability to manufacture components, often to the detriment of suppliers in the U.S., Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, etc.; from Apple’s perspective spending time and money to bring Chinese component suppliers online provides competition for its most important suppliers, giving them greater negotiating leverage. From the U.S.’s perspective this means that a host of technologies and capabilities downstream from the smartphone — which is to say nearly all electronics, including those with significant military applicability like drones — are being developed in China.</p>



<h3>Beyond Disruption</h3>



<p>Fortunately, while true disruption is often the ultimate death knell for an individual company with a specific value proposition, I don’t think it is a law of nature. Disruption is about supply, but success on the Internet, to take one example familiar to Stratechery readers, is about demand — and controlling demand is more important than controlling supply. I expanded on this in a 2015 Article called <a href="https://stratechery.com/2015/beyond-disruption/">Beyond Disruption</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The Internet has completely transformed business by making both distribution and transaction costs effectively free. In turn, this has completely changed the calculus when it comes to adding new customers: specifically, it is now possible to build businesses where every incremental customer has both zero marginal costs and zero opportunity costs. This has profound implications: instead of some companies serving the high end of a market with a superior experience while others serve the low-end with a “good-enough” offering, one company can serve everyone. And, given the choice between a superior experience and one that is “good-enough,” of course the superior experience will win.</p>



<p>To be sure, it takes time to scale such a company, but given the end game of owning the entire market, the rational approach is not to start on the low-end, but rather the exact opposite. After all, while marginal costs may be zero, providing a superior experience in the age of the Internet entails significant upfront (fixed) costs, and while those fixed costs are minimized on a per-customer basis at scale, they can have a significant impact with a small customer base. Therefore, it makes sense to start at the high-end with customers who have a greater willingness-to-pay, and from there scale downwards, decreasing your price along with the decrease in your per-customer cost base (because of scale) as you go (and again, without accruing material marginal costs).</p>

<p>This is exactly what Uber has done: the company spent its early years building its core technology and delivering a high-end experience with significantly higher prices than incumbent taxi companies. Eventually, though,&nbsp;<em>the exact same</em>&nbsp;technology was deployed to deliver a lower-priced experience to a significantly broader customer base; said customer base was brought on board at zero marginal cost.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>I want to be careful to draw too many lessons from <a href="https://stratechery.com/2015/aggregation-theory/">Aggregation Theory</a> in an Article about manufacturing, given there are by definition marginal costs involved in physical goods. However, I would note two things:</p>



<ul>
<li>First, marginal manufacturing costs are, for many goods, going down over time, thanks to automation; indeed, this is why the U.S. still has a significant amount of manufacturing output even if an ever-decreasing number of people are employed in the manufacturing sector.</li>



<li>Second, the idea that demand matters most does still hold. The takeaway from that Article isn’t that Uber is a model for the rebirth of American manufacturing; rather it’s that you can leverage demand to fundamentally reshape supply.</li>
</ul>



<p>It’s not as if the Trump administration doesn’t know this: the entire premise of these tariffs is that everyone wants access to the U.S. market, and rightly so given the outsized buying power driven both by our wealth and by the capacity for borrowing afforded us by the dollar being the reserve currency. It’s also true that China has an excess of supply; given that supply is usually built with debt that means the country needs cash flow, and even if factories are paid off, the country needs the employment opportunties. China’s hand is not as strong as many of Trump’s strongest critics believe.</p>



<p>The problem with these tariffs is that their scale and indiscriminate nature will have the effect of destroying demand <em>and</em> destroying the capability to develop alternative supply. I suppose if the only goal is to hurt China than shooting yourself in the foot, such that you no longer need to buy shoes for stumps, is a strategy you could choose, but that does nothing to help with what should be the primary motivation: shoring up the U.S. national security base.</p>



<p>Those national security concerns are real. The final stage of disruption is when the entity that started on the bottom is uniquely equipped to deliver what is necessary for a new paradigm, and that is exactly what happened with electronics generally and drones specifically. Moreover, this capability is only going to grow more important with the rise of AI, which will be substantiated in the physical world through robotics. And, of course, robots will be the key to building other robots; if the U.S. wants to be competitive in the future, and not be dependent on China, it really does need to make changes — just not these ones.</p>



<h3>A Better Plan</h3>



<p>The key distinguishing feature of a better plan is that it doesn’t seek to own supply, but rather <em>control</em> it in a way the U.S. does not today.</p>



<p>First, blanket tariffs are a mistake. I understand the motivation: a big reason why Chinese imports to the U.S. have actually shrunk over the last few years is because a lot of final assembly moved to countries like Vietnam, Thailand, Mexico, etc. Blanket tariffs stop this from happening, at least in theory.</p>



<p>The problem, however, is that those final assembly jobs are the least desirable jobs in the value chain, at least for the American worker; assuming the Trump administration doesn’t want to import millions of workers — that seems rather counter to the foundation of his candidacy! — the United States needs to find alternative trustworthy countries for final assembly. This can be accomplished through selective tariffs (which is exactly what happened in the first Trump administration).</p>



<p>Secondly, using trade flows to measure the health of the economic relationship with these countries — any country, really, but particularly final assembly countries — is legitimately stupid. Go back to the iPhone: the value-add of final assembly is in the single digit dollar range; the value-add of Apple’s software, marketing, distribution, etc. is in the hundreds of dollars. Simply looking at trade flows — where an imported iPhone is calculated as a trade deficit of several hundred dollars — completely obscures this reality. Moreover, the criteria for a final assembly country is that they have low wages, which by definition can’t pay for an equivalent amount of U.S. goods to said iPhone.</p>



<p>At the same time, the overall value of final assembly does exceed its economic value, for the reasons noted above: final assembly is gravity for higher value components, and it’s those components that are the biggest national security problem. This is where component tariffs might be a useful tool: the U.S. could use a scalpel instead of a sledgehammer to incentivize buying components from trusted allies, or from the U.S. itself, or to build new capacity in trusted locations. This does, admittedly, start to sound a lot like central planning, but that is why the gravity argument is an important one: simply moving final assembly somewhere other than China is a win — but not if there are blanket tariffs, at which point you might as well leave the supply chain where it is.</p>



<p>Third, the most important components for executing a fundamental shift in trade are those that go into building actual factories, or equipment for those factories. In the vast sea of stupidity that are these tariffs this is perhaps the stupidest detail of all: the U.S. is tariffing raw materials and components for factory equipment, like CNC machines. Consider this announcement from Haas:</p>



<div><blockquote data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Breaking – Haas reduces production of CNC machines, eliminates overtime, halts hiring, citing "dramatic decrease in demand" and concerns about reduced tariffs on Asian machines. Asks the administration for tariff exemptions on imported machine components and raw materials. <a href="https://t.co/XOAnDWQhkx">pic.twitter.com/XOAnDWQhkx</a></p>— Pete Oxenham (@peteoxenham) <a href="https://twitter.com/peteoxenham/status/1909751767610654795?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 8, 2025</a></blockquote> </div>



<p>You can certainly make the case that things like castings and other machine components are of sufficient importance to the U.S. that they ought to be manufactured here, but you have to ramp up to that. What is much more problematic is that raw materials and components are now much cheaper for Haas’ foreign competitors; even if those competitors face tariffs in the United States, their cost of goods sold will be meaningfully lower than Haas, completely defeating the goal of encouraging the purchase of U.S. machine tools.</p>



<p>I get the allure of blanket tariffs; politics is often the art of the possible, and the perfect is the enemy of the good. The problem is this approach simply isn’t good: it’s actively detrimental to what should be the U.S.’s goals. It’s also ignoring the power of demand: China would supply factories in the U.S., even if the point of those factories was to displace China, because supply needs to sell. This is how you move past disruption: you not only exert control on alternatives to China, you exert control on China itself.</p>



<p>Fourth, there remains the problem of chips. Trump just declared economic war on China, which definitionally increases the possibility of kinetic war. A kinetic war, however, will mean the destruction of TSMC, leaving the U.S. bereft of chips at the very moment that A.I. is poised to create tremendous opportunities for growth and automation. And, even if A.I. didn’t exist, it’s enough to note that modern life would grind to a halt without chips. That’s why this is the area that most needs direct intervention from the federal government, particularly in terms of <a href="https://stratechery.com/2025/ai-promise-and-chip-precariousness/">incentivizing demand for both leading and trailing edge U.S. chips</a>.</p>



<p>I do, as I noted on Monday, have more sympathy than many of Trump’s critics for the need to make fundamental changes to trade; that, however, doesn’t mean any change is ipso facto good: things could get a lot worse, and these “liberation day” tariffs will do exactly that.</p>



<h3>The Melancholy of Internet 3.0</h3>



<p>I started this essay being solipsistic, so let me conclude with some more navel-gazing: my prevailing emotion over the past week — one I didn’t fully come to grips with until interrogating why Monday’s Article failed to live up to my standards — is sadness over the end of an era in technology, and frustration-bordering-on-disillusionment over the demise of what I thought was a uniquely American spirit.</p>



<p>The first emotion goes back to that January 2021 Article about <a href="https://stratechery.com/2021/internet-3-0-and-the-beginning-of-tech-history/">Internet 3.0 and the Beginning of (Tech) History</a>:</p>



<ul>
<li>Internet 1.0 was about technology. This was the early web, where technology was made for technology’s sake. This was where we got standards like TCP/IP, DNC, HTTP, etc. This was obviously the best era, but one that was impossible to maintain once there was big money to be made on the Internet.</li>



<li>Internet 2.0 was about economics. This was the era of Aggregators — the era of Stratechery, in other words — where the Internet developed, for better or worse, in ways that made maximum economic sense. This was a massive boon for the U.S., which sits astride the world of technology; unfortunately none of the value that comes from that position is counted in the trade statistics, so the administration doesn’t seem to care.</li>



<li>Internet 3.0 is about politics. This is the era where countries make economically sub-optimal  choices for reasons that can’t be measured in dollars and cents. In that Article I thought that Big Tech exercising its power against the President might be a spur for other countries to seek to wean themselves away from American companies; instead it is the U.S. that may be leaving other countries little choice but to retaliate against U.S. tech.</li>
</ul>



<p>One can certainly make the case that the Internet 2.0 era wasn’t ideal, or even actively detrimental; it’s similar to the case that while free trade might have made everyone — especially the U.S. — richer, it wasn’t worth national security sacrifices that we are only now waking up to. For me, though, it was the era that has defined my professional life, and I’m sad to see it slipping away. Stratechery has always been non-political; it bums me out if we are moving to an era where politics are inescapable — they certainly are this week.</p>



<p>The second emotion — the frustration-bordering-on-disillusionment — is about the defeatist and backwards-looking way that the U.S. continues to approach China. These tariffs, particularly to the extent they are predicated on hurting China, are a great example: whether through malice or incompetence this particular tariff plan seems designed to inflict maximal pain, even though that means hurting the U.S. along the way. What is worse is that this is a bipartisan problem: Biden’s chip controls are similarly backwards looking, seeking to stay ahead by pulling up the ladder of U.S. technology, instead of trying to stay ahead through innovation.</p>



<p>There is, admittedly, a hint of that old school American can-do attitude embedded in these tariffs: the Trump administration seems to believe the U.S. can overcome all of the naysayers and skeptics through sheer force of will. That force of will, however, would be much better spent pursuing a vision of a new world order in 2050, not trying to return to 1950. That is possible to do, by the way, but only if you accept 1950’s living standards, which weren’t nearly as attractive as nostalgia-colored glasses paint them as, and if we’re not careful, 1950’s technology as well. I think we can do better that that; I know we can do better than this.</p>

         }"><p data-block-key="jyf9e">Today at Google Cloud Next 25, we’re introducing Ironwood, our seventh-generation Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) — our most performant and scalable custom AI accelerator to date, and the first designed specifically for inference. For more than a decade, TPUs have powered Google’s most demanding AI training and serving workloads, and have enabled our Cloud customers to do the same. Ironwood is our most powerful, capable and energy efficient TPU yet. And it's purpose-built to power thinking, inferential AI models at scale.</p><p data-block-key="9rrl9">Ironwood represents a significant shift in the development of AI and the infrastructure that powers its progress. It’s a move from <i>responsive</i> AI models that provide real-time information for people to interpret, to models that provide the <i>proactive</i> generation of insights and interpretation. This is what we call the “age of inference” where AI agents will proactively retrieve and generate data to collaboratively deliver insights and answers, not just data.</p><p data-block-key="7kvmh">Ironwood is built to support this next phase of generative AI and its tremendous computational and communication requirements. It scales up to 9,216 liquid cooled chips linked with breakthrough Inter-Chip Interconnect (ICI) networking spanning nearly 10 MW. It is one of several new components of <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/compute/whats-new-with-ai-hypercomputer">Google Cloud AI Hypercomputer</a> architecture, which optimizes hardware and software together for the most demanding AI workloads. With Ironwood, developers can also leverage Google’s own <a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/introducing-pathways-next-generation-ai-architecture/">Pathways</a> software stack to reliably and easily harness the combined computing power of tens of thousands of Ironwood TPUs.</p><p data-block-key="at188">Here’s a closer look at how these innovations work together to take on the most demanding training and serving workloads with unparalleled performance, cost and power efficiency.</p></div>

         }"><h2 data-block-key="qleld">Powering the age of inference with Ironwood</h2><p data-block-key="4cq8f">Ironwood is designed to gracefully manage the complex computation and communication demands of "thinking models," which encompass Large Language Models (LLMs), Mixture of Experts (MoEs) and advanced reasoning tasks. These models require massive parallel processing and efficient memory access. In particular, Ironwood is designed to minimize data movement and latency on chip while carrying out massive tensor manipulations. At the frontier, the computation demands of thinking models extend well beyond the capacity of any single chip. We designed Ironwood TPUs with a low-latency, high bandwidth ICI network to support coordinated, synchronous communication at full TPU pod scale.</p><p data-block-key="2ec6a">For Google Cloud customers, Ironwood comes in two sizes based on AI workload demands: a 256 chip configuration and a 9,216 chip configuration.</p><ul><li data-block-key="6aolq">When scaled to 9,216 chips per pod for a total of 42.5 Exaflops, Ironwood supports more than 24x the compute power of the world’s largest supercomputer – El Capitan – which offers just 1.7 Exaflops per pod. Ironwood delivers the massive parallel processing power necessary for the most demanding AI workloads, such as super large size dense LLM or MoE models with thinking capabilities for training and inference. Each individual chip boasts peak compute of 4,614 TFLOPs. This represents a monumental leap in AI capability. Ironwood’s memory and network architecture ensures that the right data is always available to support peak performance at this massive scale.</li><li data-block-key="11gmm">Ironwood also features an enhanced <a href="https://cloud.google.com/tpu/docs/system-architecture-tpu-vm#sparsecore">SparseCore</a>, a specialized accelerator for processing ultra-large embeddings common in advanced ranking and recommendation workloads. Expanded SparseCore support in Ironwood allows for a wider range of workloads to be accelerated, including moving beyond the traditional AI domain to financial and scientific domains.</li><li data-block-key="9p4p1">Pathways, Google’s own ML runtime <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.12533">developed</a> by Google DeepMind, enables efficient distributed computing across multiple TPU chips. Pathways on Google Cloud makes moving beyond a single Ironwood Pod straightforward, enabling hundreds of thousands of Ironwood chips to be composed together to rapidly advance the frontiers of gen AI computation.</li></ul></div>

</p>
<p><strong>Whisky is no longer actively maintained.</strong></p>
</div>
<p>WhiskyWine will no longer be receiving any further updates. We will not be upgrading
to Wine 8+, and fixes for specific apps and games, <a href="https://docs.getwhisky.app/steam.html">like Steam</a> will not be produced.</p>
<p>Occasional updates may still come if macOS fundamentally breaks the main app, like it did in 15.4.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-i-play-my-games-then"><a href="#how-do-i-play-my-games-then">"How do I play my games then?"</a></h2>
<p>If Whisky is no longer cutting it for your needs, <a href="https://www.codeweavers.com/store?ad=1010">buy CrossOver</a>.
A lot of people are confused on CrossOver's pricing:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's not a subscription it's a license. You can continue to use the version you purchased forever. If you don't need to upgrade, you don't have to.</li>
<li>It costs less to upgrade your license to a new version than it does to buy a license upfront. So you will not be paying $74 every year.</li>
<li>There are frequent sales and discount codes available if you wait.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-are-you-no-longer-updating-it"><a href="#why-are-you-no-longer-updating-it">"Why are you no longer updating it?"</a></h2>
<p>I have received many questions on this decision, but it continues to be asked, so I figured it was
time to update both the repository and the website to explicitly state this.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I lost interest in the project. Running it is incredibly time-consuming, and as I'm still a student
and also not being paid for work on Whisky it becomes hard to justify working on it if I no longer enjoy it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whisky, in my opinion, has not been a positive on the Wine community as a whole. My original
goal for the project was for it to be 'engine' agnostic, simply serve as a frontend for Wine, and not provide a bundled
version itself. That all changed when GPTK came out at WWDC. So right out of the gate, the goals of the project
were pretty muddied.</p>
<p>Developing Wine is hard. The codebase is exclusively written in C for maximum portability, but that also
places a rather high barrier to entry for those looking to contribute. Not to mention the reverse engineering
skills required to debug malfunctioning apps and games. A lot of incredibly talented people spend a lot of time
working on it but for a project like Wine, you need people working on it full-time.</p>
<p>Wine is one of those few projects that actually has sizeable funding behind it. Valve has invested a lot into
the project as it's the backbone of Proton, on which their whole gaming-on-Linux and Steam Deck strategy is based.
The problem is, macOS is not Linux, and it poses significant challenges that are unique to it over any other UNIX
operating system. Fixes for macOS have to come from people who are not only incredibly knowledgeable on C, Wine, Windows,
but also macOS. As you can imagine, the pool of developers with those skills is very limited.</p>
<p>That is where CrossOver and CodeWeavers come in. Without CodeWeavers there would be no Wine on Mac. There would be
no GPTK. Hell, even Rosetta would likely be more restricted as many of the extensions added in recent months
were only added due to pressure from Mac gamers.</p>
<p><strong>The revenue from CrossOver is what keeps Wine on Mac alive.</strong></p>
<p>By contrast, Whisky is based on CrossOver, but we don't produce any bespoke fixes. I, quite frankly, do not have
the requisite skills or time to do so. As a result, the amount that Whisky as a whole to Wine is exactly zero.
This is not a fair trade, and continuing this parasitic relationship could easily harm CrossOver's continued
profitibility and the existence of Wine on Mac as a whole.</p>
<p>TLDR; Whisky harms Wine on Mac.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="whats-the-real-reason"><a href="#whats-the-real-reason">"What's the <em>real</em> reason?"</a></h2>
<p>That's it. That's the real reason. I do not work for CodeWeavers. I receive no payment from them aside
from a small commission from CrossOver sales using my affiliate link, which is small and infrequent.</p>
<p>There's no conspiracy, it's simply just not the right thing to do. Whisky was certainly a big undertaking,
and will probably be the most widely used solo project of my life so I don't take this decision lightly.</p>
<h2 id="whats-next"><a href="#whats-next">"What's next?"</a></h2>
<p>Those who know me know that I've already moved on to several other projects. Most recently, I've been helping out
with porting Sonic Unleashed Recompiled to macOS and Metal. I will continue to do cool stuff in the Mac space
but just not this.</p>
<p>If you want to find me, best places are my <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/isaacmarovitz.com">Bluesky</a>, and my <a href="https://github.com/IsaacMarovitz">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>If you got this far, thank you for reading,</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div aria-label="Content">
        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Most of the Firefox User Interface (UI), including the address bar and the tab strip, are implemented using standard web technologies like HTML, CSS and JavaScript plus some additional custom components like <a href="https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/browser/components/storybook/docs/README.xul-and-html.stories.html">XUL</a>. One of the advantages of using web technologies for the front end is that it allows rendering the frontend using the browser engine on all desktop operating systems. However, just like many web applications are susceptible to some form of injection attack (<a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/">OWASP Top Ten</a>), Firefox’s use of web technologies for the frontend makes it no exception and hence it is vulnerable to injection attacks as well.</p>

<p>The most well known type of injection attack are Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. Like the name suggests, these attacks violate the boundary between different sites and circumvent first line security defenses like the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy">same-origin policy</a>. As with the existence of boundaries between different sites, the Firefox UI, which runs in the parent process, is separated from web content running in <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2021/05/introducing-firefox-new-site-isolation-security-architecture/">lower-privileged content processes</a>. The sandboxed web content should not be able to inject content, especially code, into the parent process. Of course there needs to be some way for both parent and child processes to communicate with each other - otherwise it would, for example, be impossible to update a tab’s title in the UI after a web page sets its own document title. The way Firefox accomplishes this interaction is through a system called IPC - <a href="https://attackanddefense.dev/bug-bounty/firefox-internals/hack-and-tell/2021/04/27/examining-javascript-inter-process-communication-in-firefox.html">inter-process communication</a>.</p>

<p>In Pwn2Own (a computer hacking contest) 2022 a participant managed to find a chain of exploits that allowed them to escape the web content sandbox (cf. <a href="https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/blog/2022/8/23/but-you-told-me-you-were-safe-attacking-the-mozilla-firefox-renderer-part-2">write-up by a ZDI employee</a>, a <a href="https://attackanddefense.dev/bug-bounty/firefox-internals/hack-and-tell/2021/04/27/examining-javascript-inter-process-communication-in-firefox.html">generalized introduction</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StQ_6juJlZY&amp;t=0s">video by LifeOverflow</a>). A part of this exploit chain involved creating a JavaScript inline event handler (using setAttribute) in the Firefox UI, and then triggering the execution of that event handler. For websites, the well known approach of mitigating XSS attacks using inline event handlers usually involves using a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CSP">Content-Security-Policy</a> (CSP). CSP allows for restricting what scripts are allowed to execute on a given page. Typically by only allowing scripts from specific URLs, or with specific hashes. In particular, unless <code>‘unsafe-inline’</code> is specified, all attempts to define inline event handlers are blocked by the browser. And because the Firefox UI uses HTML with some special sauce, we can actually also use CSPs in the same way to harden the Firefox frontend code.</p>

<h2 id="progress">Progress</h2>

<p>The main Firefox UI, which contains the tabs, address bar, menu bar etc. is actually just one big XHTML document called <a href="https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/base/content/browser.xhtml">browser.xhtml</a>. Recently we have removed in total over 600 inline event handlers across <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1890547">50 bugs</a> from this XHTML document. At this point we want to acknowledge the support of the Firefox frontend team, without their co-operation we wouldn’t have been able to land so many changes in such a short amount of time.</p>

<h3 id="interlude-how-to-replace-inline-event-handlers">Interlude: How to replace inline event handlers</h3>

<p>In case you are a Firefox developer, the maintainer of a Firefox fork like the Tor Browser, or just a web developer interested in securing your own website, the following might be relevant to you. The process of removing inline event handlers usually involves finding all the places that define an inline event handler like <code>&lt;button onclick="buttonClicked()"&gt;</code> and then replacing this with a call to <code>addEventListener</code> from a new JS file. Roughly like this:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>button</span> <span>=</span> <span>document</span><span>.</span><span>querySelector</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>button</span><span>"</span><span>);</span>
<span>button</span><span>.</span><span>addEventListener</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>click</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>buttonClicked</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>However there are some important differences to keep in mind between JS code running as inline event handlers and normal event handlers. Firstly, it’s possible to <code>return false;</code> from the inline event handler, which is equivalent to calling <code>event.preventDefault()</code>. Also note that <code>this</code>, which is <code>event.currentTarget</code> for inline event handlers, would change if you replaced it with an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions">arrow function</a> as the event listener.</p>

<h2 id="outlook">Outlook</h2>

<p>While browser.xhtml contains most parts of the main Firefox UI, some windows and sidebars are based on their own (X)HTML files. Due to the fact that browser.xhtml provides the largest attack vector of our frontend code we focused our initial efforts on securing and hardening browser.xhtml which already drastically improves the status quo to prevent inline script execution. For other windows, such as the “About Firefox” dialog, we go even further by adding CSPs that are much more restrictive and go beyond just blocking scripts. If you are familiar with CSP, by default we set a baseline CSP like <code>default-src chrome: resource:;</code>, which basically means we only allow loading resources from files that are shipped with Firefox.
Historically we have already added CSPs to <code>about:</code> pages such as <code>about:preferences</code> that are displayed like normal websites (cf. <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/attack-and-defense/2020/07/07/hardening-firefox-against-injection-attacks-the-technical-details/">Hardening Firefox against Injection Attacks</a>). Our end goal is to block all dynamic code execution in Firefox (like <code>eval</code>) entirely, to provide the best and most secure Firefox version possible that is resilient to any kind of XSS attacks.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>We have rewritten over 600 JavaScript event handlers to mitigate XSS and other injection attacks in the main Firefox user interface. This mitigation will ship in Firefox 138. However, blocking the execution of scripts in the parent process is not the end - we will expand this technique to other contexts in the near future. There is still more work to do as the UI requires JavaScript APIs with a high level of privileges. <strong>However: We still eliminated a whole class of attacks</strong>, significantly raising the bar for attackers to exploit Firefox. In fact, we hopefully just broke someone’s exploit chain.</p>
