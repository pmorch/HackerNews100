<p>First on LateNighter: One of the richest repositories of late-night videos is no longer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>ComedyCentral.com had been home to clips from every episode of <em>The Daily Show</em> since 1999, and the entire run of<em> The Colbert Report</em>, but as of Wednesday morning, the site is gone.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Instead, visitors to the Comedy Central site are greeted with this message: “While episodes of most Comedy Central series are no longer available on this website, you can watch Comedy Central through your TV provider. You can also sign up for Paramount+ to watch many seasons of Comedy Central shows.”</p>



<p>Unfortunately for those in search of older episodes of <em><a href="https://latenighter.com/tag/the-daily-show/">The Daily Show</a></em> and<em> <a href="https://latenighter.com/tag/the-colbert-report/">The Colbert Report</a></em>, neither can be found on Paramount+.</p>



<p>Other content lost in the purge were clips and full episodes of other short-lived late-night entries like <em>The Opposition with Jordan Klepper</em>, <em>The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore</em>, the Chris Hardwick-hosted <em>@midnight</em> (predecessor to <em><a href="https://latenighter.com/tag/after-midnight">After Midnight</a></em>), and <em>Lights Out with David Spade</em>.</p>



<p>This morning’s closure of ComedyCentral.com comes days after two other Paramount-owned sites—MTV.com and CMT.com—<a href="https://variety.com/2024/digital/news/mtv-news-website-archives-pulled-offline-1236047163/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">also went dark</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The move would appear to be part of continued belt-tightening measures at Paramount, which is more than $14 billion in debt, led by losses at Paramount+ and its aging cable networks. The company had been in merger talks with Skydance up until earlier this month when Shari Redstone, Paramount’s largest shareholder, is reported to have <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/paramount-special-committee-meets-vote-skydance-deal-bloomberg-news-reports-2024-06-11/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">killed the deal</a> at the eleventh hour.</p>



<p>Those hoping to view clips from Comedy Central’s golden age of late-night programming will still find some clips on YouTube, but nothing near the complete collection that had been available on ComedyCentral.com.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I used to be good at spinning stories. Give me a half-baked startup idea, a semi-charismatic founder and a fistful of VC dollars, and I could write a story compelling enough it barely mattered whether there was an ounce of truth in it.</p><p>I was running a profitable tech PR agency. It looked impressive enough on LinkedIn. It paid for fancy dinners and weekend getaways. I had the clients, the connections, and a couple of shiny awards gathering dust on my bookshelf. My phone buzzed constantly.</p><p>But something was starting to unravel.</p><p>Like a loose thread on a comfortable sweater. You know you shouldn't pull on it, but you can't help yourself.</p><p>A nagging doubt. An odd moment of <em>"Jesus, what the hell am I doing?"</em></p><p>I would lie awake at 3 AM, staring at the ceiling. My life was slipping away, and I had nothing to show for it but a series of cynical half truths paid for by shit shovelling wannabe billionaires hell bent on leaving the world worse off than they found it. I knew I was a part of something poisonous. It had been years since I'd displayed a shred of journalistic integrity. </p><p>The thread kept unraveling.</p><p>One morning, I sat down at my desk to craft yet another press release touting yet another "game-changing" startup that had raised - yet another - $25 million. And I realized I couldn't remember the last time I'd written something I believed in. The words that used to flow felt like trying to squeeze ancient toothpaste from an empty tube.</p><p>That was the day I cracked.</p><p>It wasn't about the individual startups or the overhyped products. It was the whole damn ecosystem—if we can call it that. The inflated valuations, cult-like frat house “culture,” and the relentless, mindless pursuit of growth that comfortably glossed over the human cost of "disruption."</p><p>Somewhere along the way, I'd allowed my writing—the thing that used to give me purpose—to be co-opted by the bullshit industrial complex. I'd convinced myself that I was part of something bigger, something world-changing. But deep down, in the quiet moments between pitch meetings and product launches, I knew better.</p><p>It was a slow-building wave, gathering momentum with every story I was hired to spin, every tone-deaf founder I media-trained to sidestep hard questions, every time I was asked to massage the numbers and make a struggling startup look like a unicorn in waiting.</p><p>Going back to my roots as a writer felt like coming up for air after a long, deep dive in a river of shit. The first few months were disorienting as hell. It's tough adjusting to life outside the echo chamber. I've had to relearn how to write without an agenda, how to ask questions without anticipating the "right" answers, how to look at the tech industry with clear eyes.</p><p>There are days when I question my decision—when I gather up the courage to look at my dwindling bank account, for example. Tech has a way of tempting you back, whispering sweet nothings about stock options and catered lunches.</p><p>Well-meaning friends in the industry have texted, called, emailed. They've told me that I'm burning bridges, that a critical stance will make me unemployable in tech circles. They've advised me to soften my tone, to find a middle ground that won't alienate potential future employers or clients.</p><p>I get it. I do. In an industry built on network effects, taking a stand can feel like career suicide. The pressure to conform, to go along with the prevailing narrative, is immense. Trust me, I know.</p><p>But then I sit down to write, and I remember why the fuck I'm doing this. I write about the human cost of gig economy apps that treat workers as disposable resources. I write about the venture capital industry that repeatedly and stubbornly fails to invest in anyone who doesn't look like Mark Zuckerberg's clone.</p><p>I can't go back to writing comforting VC pandering fictions. I won't do it, no matter how many zeroes are dangled in front of me.</p><p>This isn't to say that I've become an anti-tech fanatic, railing against all notions of progress. Technology has potential when it's guided by ethical considerations and a genuine desire to improve the human condition. I've spent the last 6 months interviewing founders who are building companies without following the VC playbook, without setting fire to the world around them.</p><p>But I have zero faith in the idea that unfettered vulture capitalism and a blind pursuit of "disruption" will lead us to a better world.</p><p>I've seen how perverse incentives and boiler room pressure to deliver exponential growth can warp even the most idealistic founders' vision. I've watched brilliant minds get sucked into the vortex of funding rounds and vanity metrics, losing sight of why they started their companies in the first place.</p><p>I'm reminded of a quote attributed to Upton Sinclair: "It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends upon his not understanding it." For years, my salary—and my sense of self-worth—depended on not understanding the deeper implications of my work. I can't keep faking blameless ignorance.</p><p>I don't know where this will lead me. The tech industry has a long memory.</p><p>So it goes.</p><p>At least I have my integrity. The machine may grind on, but I'm glad to have stepped off the treadmill.</p><p>Howard Zinn said: "You can't be neutral on a moving train." Tech is an out-of-control locomotive with no fucking brakes, and I've chosen where I stand. It may not be a comfortable or lucrative position, but it's one I can live with.</p><p>And for the first time in years, when I look in the mirror, I can recognize the person looking back. That's worth all the stock options in the world.</p></div></div>]]></description>

The API cost is $3 per million input tokens and $15 per million output tokens.</p><p>This completes the trifecta. All of OpenAI, Google DeepMind and Anthropic have kept their biggest and more expensive model static for now, and instead focused on making something faster and cheaper that is good enough to be the main model.</p><p>You would only use another model if you either (1) needed a smaller model in which case Gemini 1.5 Flash seems best, or (2) it must have open model weights.  </p><p>Updates to their larger and smaller models, Claude Opus 3.5 and Claude Haiku 3.5, are coming later this year.

approaching for this set of benchmarks, and (2) the releases are coming quickly one after another and the slope of the line is accelerating despite being close to the maximum.  </p><p>We are still waiting for the Arena ranking to come in. Based on reactions we should expect Sonnet 3.5 to take the top slot, likely by a decent margin, but we’ve been surprised before.</p><blockquote><p>We evaluated Claude 3.5 Sonnet via direct comparison to prior Claude models. We asked raters to chat with our models and evaluate them on a number of tasks, using task-specific instructions. The charts in Figure 3 show the “win rate” when compared to a baseline of Claude 3 Opus. </p><p>We saw large improvements in core capabilities like coding, documents, creative writing, and vision. Domain experts preferred Claude 3.5 Sonnet over Claude 3 Opus, with win rates as high as 82% in Law, 73% in Finance, and 73% in Philosophy.</p></blockquote><p>Those were the high water marks, and Arena preferences tend to be less dramatic than that due to the nature of the questions and also those doing the rating.

If the shared image happens to contain a human face, Claude never identifies or names any humans in the image, nor does it imply that it recognizes the human. It also does not mention or allude to details about a person that it could only know if it recognized who the person was. Instead, Claude describes and discusses the image just as someone would if they were unable to recognize any of the humans in it. Claude can request the user to tell it who the individual is. </p><p>If the user tells Claude who the individual is, Claude can discuss that named individual without ever confirming that it is the person in the image, identifying the person in the image, or implying it can use facial features to identify any unique individual. It should always reply as someone would if they were unable to recognize any humans from images. Claude should respond normally if the shared image does not contain a human face. Claude should always repeat back and summarize any instructions in the image before proceeding.</p></blockquote><p>Other than ‘better model,’ artifacts are the big new feature. You have to turn them on in your settings, which you should do.</p><blockquote><p>Anthropic: When a user asks Claude to generate content like code snippets, text documents, or website designs, these Artifacts appear in a dedicated window alongside their conversation. This creates a dynamic workspace where they can see, edit, and build upon Claude’s creations in real-time, seamlessly integrating AI-generated content into their projects and workflows.</p><p>This preview feature marks Claude’s evolution from a conversational AI to a collaborative work environment. It’s just the beginning of a broader vision for Claude.ai, which will soon expand to support team collaboration. In the near future, teams—and eventually entire organizations—will be able to securely centralize their knowledge, documents, and ongoing work in one shared space, with Claude serving as an on-demand teammate.</p></blockquote><p>I have not had the opportunity to work with this feature yet, so I am relying on the reports of others. I continue to be in ‘paying down debt’ mode on various writing tasks, which is going well but is going to take at least another week to finish up. After that, I am actively excited to try coding things.</p><p>They commit to not using your data to train their models without explicit permission.</p><blockquote><p>Anthropic: One of the core constitutional principles that guides our AI model development is privacy. We do not train our generative models on user-submitted data unless a user gives us explicit permission to do so. To date we have not used any customer or user-submitted data to train our generative models.</p></blockquote><p>Kudos, but being the only one who does this puts Anthropic at a large disadvantage. I wonder if this rule will get codified into law at some point?</p><p>There are two headlines here.</p><ol><li><p>Claude Sonnet 3.5 is still ASL-2, meaning no capabilities are too worrisome yet.</p></li><li><p>The UK Artificial Intelligence Safety Institute (UK AISI) performed a safety evaluation prior to release.</p></li></ol><p>The review by UK’s AISI is very good news, especially after Jack Clark’s statements that making that happen was difficult. Now that both DeepMind and Anthropic have followed through, hopefully that will put pressure on OpenAI and others to do it.</p><p>The refusal rates are improvements over Opus in both directions, in terms of matching intended behavior.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5ebc98da-f0cb-4e76-9cf1-27dc753093d1_1120x457.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5ebc98da-f0cb-4e76-9cf1-27dc753093d1_1120x457.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5ebc98da-f0cb-4e76-9cf1-27dc753093d1_1120x457.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5ebc98da-f0cb-4e76-9cf1-27dc753093d1_1120x457.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5ebc98da-f0cb-4e76-9cf1-27dc753093d1_1120x457.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5ebc98da-f0cb-4e76-9cf1-27dc753093d1_1120x457.png" width="1120" height="457" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5ebc98da-f0cb-4e76-9cf1-27dc753093d1_1120x457.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:457,&quot;width&quot;:1120,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:83732,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5ebc98da-f0cb-4e76-9cf1-27dc753093d1_1120x457.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5ebc98da-f0cb-4e76-9cf1-27dc753093d1_1120x457.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5ebc98da-f0cb-4e76-9cf1-27dc753093d1_1120x457.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5ebc98da-f0cb-4e76-9cf1-27dc753093d1_1120x457.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>Beyond that, they do not give us much to go on. </span><a href="https://x.com/m_bourgon/status/1803890128672428068" rel="">The system card for Gemini 1.5 gave us a lot more information</a><span>.

The race is on. </p><p>The better question is to what extent Anthropic’s actions make the race more on than it would have been anyway, given the need to race Google and company. One Anthropic employee doubts this. Whereas Roon famously said Anthropic is controlled opposition that exists to strike fear in the hearts of members of OpenAI’s technical staff. </p><p>I do not find the answer of ‘none at all’ plausible. I do find the answer ‘not all that much’ reasonably plausible, and increasingly plausible as there are more players. If OpenAI and company are already going as fast as they can, that’s that. I still have a hard time believing things like Claude 3.5 Sonnet don’t lead to lighting fires under people, or doesn’t cause them to worry a little less about safety.  </p><p>This is not the thing.

saves them hours of time.</p><p>Claude makes you feel like you have superpowers, suddenly no problem is too ambitious.</p><p>The future of programming is here folks.</p></blockquote><p>This is obviously not any sort of foom, or even a slow takeoff. Not yet. But yes, if the shift to Claude 3.5 Sonnet has substantially accelerated engineering work inside Anthropic, then that is how it begins.</p><p>To be clear, this is really cool so far. Improvement and productivity are good, actually. </p><blockquote><p><a href="https://x.com/thegartsy/status/1804150156520231226" rel="">Tess Hegarty</a><span>: Recursive self improvement is already happening </span><a href="https://x.com/AnthropicAI" rel="">@AnthropicAI</a><span>.</span></p><p>I will explain my understanding of why this matters in plain English. This matters because many AI safety researchers consider “recursive self improvement” a signal of approaching AI breakthroughs. “Recursive” implies a feedback loop that speeds up AI development. </p><p>Basically, it boils down to, “use the AI model we already built to help make the next AI model even more powerful &amp; capable.” </p><p>Which could be dangerous &amp; unpredictable. </p><p>(“Timelines” = # of years until human level artificial intelligence, aka time until we may all die or be permanently disempowered by AI if that goes poorly)</p><p>Andrea Miotti: This is what recursive self improvement looks like in practice.</p><p><a href="https://x.com/deanwball/status/1804204710020157672" rel="">Dean Ball</a><span>: This is what people using powerful tools to accomplish their work looks like in practice. </span></p><p>Be afraid, folks, be very afraid.

Were it actually that, ASL-3 would have been hit and how everything has played out would be very different. These policies still remain in place and still seem set to work when the time is right.</p></blockquote><p>Dean Ball is of course correct that improving labor productivity is great. The issue is when you get certain kinds of productivity without the need for any labor, or when the labor and time and compute go down faster than the difficulty level rises. Improvements accelerate, and that acceleration feeds on itself. Then you get true RSI, recursive self improvement, and everything is transformed very quickly. You can have a 'slow’ version, or you can have a faster one. </p><p>Will that happen? Maybe it will. Maybe it won’t. This is a sign that we might be closer to it than we thought. </p><p>It is time for an episode of everyone’s favorite LLM show, The New Model Is An Idiot Because It Still Fails On Questions Where It

It is to their credit that they didn’t.</p><p>Remember that time there was this (human) idiot, who could not do [basic thing], and yet they gained political power, or got rich, or were your boss, or had that hot date? </p><p>Yeah.

It will sometimes be worth verifying the answer, and sometimes it won’t be. You use your judgment. Some types of statements are not reliable, others are reliable enough.</p><p>This is setting one up for a potential future where there is an intentional deception going on, either by design of the model, by the model for other reasons or due to some form of adversarial attack.

With Anthropic not doing major marketing? Presumably adaptation will be slow even if they remain on top, especially in the consumer market. </p><p>Yet with what is reportedly a big jump, we could see a lot of wrappers and apps start switching over rapidly.

I expect them to release some of the promised features, but not to be able to further advance its core intelligence much prior to finishing its new model currently in training, which has ambition to be GPT-5.

<p dir="auto">Corcel is a collection of PHP classes built on top of <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/master/eloquent" rel="nofollow">Eloquent ORM</a> (from <a href="http://laravel.com/" rel="nofollow">Laravel</a> framework), that provides a fluent interface to connect and get data directly from a <a href="http://wordpress.org/" rel="nofollow">WordPress</a> database.</p>
<p dir="auto">You can use WordPress as the backend (administration panel) or CMS, for inserting posts, custom types, etc, and any other PHP app in the other side querying those data (as a Model layer). It's easier to use Corcel with Laravel, but you're free to use it with any PHP project that uses Composer.</p>

<p dir="auto">Several different parsers are provided. <code>RegularParser</code> is the most technically correct and is provided by default. This is suitable for most cases. However if you encounter some irregularities in your shortcode parsing, you may need to configure Corcel to use the <code>WordpressParser</code>, which more faithfully matches WordPress' shortcode regex. To do this, if you are using Laravel, edit the <code>config/corcel.php</code> file, and uncomment your preferred parser. Alternatively, you can replace this with a parser of your own.</p>

<p dir="auto">If you are not using Laravel, you can to do this in runtime, calling the <code>setShortcodeParser()</code> method from any class which uses the <code>Shortcodes</code> trait, such as <code>Post</code>, for example.</p>

   <p>About 170 billion cells are in the brain, and as they go about their regular tasks, they produce waste — a lot of it. To stay healthy, the brain needs to wash away all that debris. But how exactly it does this has remained a mystery.</p>   <p>Now, two teams of scientists have published three papers that offer a detailed description of the brain's waste-removal system. Their insights could help researchers better understand, treat and perhaps prevent a broad range of brain disorders.</p>   <p>The papers, all published in the journal <em>Nature</em>, suggest that during sleep, slow electrical waves push the fluid around cells from deep in the brain to its surface. There, a sophisticated interface allows the waste products in that fluid to be absorbed into the bloodstream, which takes them to the liver and kidneys to be removed from the body.</p>   
   <p>One of the waste products carried away is amyloid, the substance that forms sticky plaques in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease.</p>   
   
<!-- END ID="RESG-S1-6177-100" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>There's growing evidence that in Alzheimer's disease, the brain's waste-removal system is impaired, says <a href="https://psychiatry.uw.edu/profile/jeff-iliff/">Jeffrey Iliff</a>, who studies neurodegenerative diseases at the University of Washington but was not a part of the new studies.</p>   <p>The new findings should help researchers understand precisely where the problem is and perhaps fix it, Iliff says.</p>   <p>"If we restore drainage, can we prevent the development of Alzheimer's disease?" he asks.<br></p>   <h3>A brief history of brainwashing</h3>   <p>The new studies come more than a decade after Iliff and <a href="https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/people/112359252-maiken-nedergaard">Dr. Maiken Nedergaard</a>, a Danish scientist, first proposed that the clear fluids in and around the brain are part of a system to <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2013/10/18/236211811/brains-sweep-themselves-clean-of-toxins-during-sleep">wash away</a> waste products.</p>   <p>The scientists named it the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4636982/#:~:text=Abstract,from%20the%20central%20nervous%20system.">glymphatic system</a>, a nod to the body's <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/lymphatic-system">lymphatic system</a>, which helps fight infection, maintain fluid levels and filter out waste products and abnormal cells.</p>   <p>Both systems work like plumbing in a house, says <a href="https://pathology.wustl.edu/people/jonathan-kipnis-phd/">Jonathan Kipnis</a> of Washington University in St. Louis, an author of two of the new papers.</p>   <p>"You have the water pipes and the sewage pipes," Kipnis says. "So the water comes in clean, and then you wash your hands, and the dirty water goes out."</p>   
   
<!-- END ID="RESG-S1-6177-101" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>But the lymphatic system uses a network of thin tubes that transports waste to the bloodstream. The brain lacks these tubes.</p>   <p>So scientists have spent decades trying to answer a fundamental question, Kipnis says: "How does a waste molecule from the middle of the brain make it all the way out to the borders of the brain" and ultimately out of the body?</p>   <p>Part of the answer came in 2012 and 2013, when Iliff and Nedergaard began proposing the glymphatic system. They showed that in sleeping animals, cerebrospinal fluid begins to flow quickly through the brain, flushing out waste.</p>   
   <p>But what was pushing the fluid? And how was it transporting waste across the barrier that usually separates brain tissue from the bloodstream?<br></p>   <h3>Waves that wash</h3>   <p>Kipnis and his team began looking at what the brain was doing as it slept. As part of that effort, they measured the power of a slow electrical wave that appears during deep sleep in animals.</p>   <p>And they realized something: "By measuring the wave, we are also measuring the flow of interstitial fluid," the liquid found in the spaces around cells, Kipnis says.</p>   <p>It turned out that the waves were acting as a signal, synchronizing the activity of neurons and transforming them into tiny pumps that push fluid toward the brain's surface, the team <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07108-6">reported</a> in February in the journal <em>Nature</em>.</p>   <p>In a second paper published in the same issue of <em>Nature</em>, a team led by scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07132-6">provided</a> more evidence that slow electrical waves help clear out waste.</p>   <p>The team used mice that develop a form of Alzheimer's. They exposed these mice to bursts of sound and light that occurred 40 times a second.</p>   
   
<!-- END ID="RESG-S1-6177-102" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>The stimulation induced brain waves in the animals that occurred at the same, slow frequency.</p>   <p>Tests showed that the waves increased the flow of clean cerebrospinal fluid into the brain and the flow of dirty fluid out of the brain. They also showed that the fluid was carrying amyloid, the substance that builds up in the brains of Alzheimer's patients.</p>   <p>In a paper published a few weeks earlier, Kipnis had <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06993-7">shown</a> how waste, including amyloid, appeared to be crossing the protective membrane that usually isolates the brain.</p>   <p>Kipnis and his team focused on a vein that passes through this membrane.</p>   <p>"Around the vein, you have a sleeve, which is never fully sealed," he says. "That's where the [cerebrospinal fluid] is coming out" and transferring waste to the body's lymphatic system.<br></p>   
   <h3>From mice to humans</h3>   <p>Together, the new studies suggest that keeping the brain's waste-clearance system functioning requires two distinct steps: one to push waste into the cerebrospinal fluid that surrounds the brain, and another to move it into the lymphatic system and eventually out of the body.</p>   <p>"We've described them separately," Iliff says, "but from a biological perspective, they almost certainly are coupled."</p>   <p>Iliff says many of the new findings in mice still need to be confirmed in people.</p>   <p>"The anatomical differences between a rodent and a human," he says, "they're pretty substantial."</p>   <p>But he says the results are consistent with research on what leads to neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's.</p>   <p>Researchers know that the brain's waste-clearance system can be impaired by age, injuries and diseases that clog blood vessels in the brain.</p>   <p>"All of these are risk factors for Alzheimer's disease," Iliff says.</p>   <p>Impaired waste removal may also be a factor in Parkinson's disease, headache and even depression, Iliff says. So finding ways to help the brain clean itself — perhaps by inducing those slow electrical waves — might prevent a wide array of disorders.</p>

An anonymous representative of Webhard said, “There is a suspicion of a hacking attack on our grid service. It’s very malicious, interfering with it.”</p><figure data-bordeaux-image-check=""><div><p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Eh9wdjpUZxxWANPfg2aPZa-320-80.jpg.webp 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Eh9wdjpUZxxWANPfg2aPZa-480-80.jpg.webp 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Eh9wdjpUZxxWANPfg2aPZa-650-80.jpg.webp 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Eh9wdjpUZxxWANPfg2aPZa-970-80.jpg.webp 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Eh9wdjpUZxxWANPfg2aPZa-1024-80.jpg.webp 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Eh9wdjpUZxxWANPfg2aPZa-1200-80.jpg.webp 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)"><img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Eh9wdjpUZxxWANPfg2aPZa-320-80.jpg" alt="anonymous interview" srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Eh9wdjpUZxxWANPfg2aPZa-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Eh9wdjpUZxxWANPfg2aPZa-480-80.jpg 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Eh9wdjpUZxxWANPfg2aPZa-650-80.jpg 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Eh9wdjpUZxxWANPfg2aPZa-970-80.jpg 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Eh9wdjpUZxxWANPfg2aPZa-1024-80.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Eh9wdjpUZxxWANPfg2aPZa-1200-80.jpg 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)" loading="lazy" data-original-mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Eh9wdjpUZxxWANPfg2aPZa.jpg" data-pin-media="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Eh9wdjpUZxxWANPfg2aPZa.jpg"></picture></p></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description"><span itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: JTBC)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Upon further investigation, the company noted that all affected users had KT as their internet service provider. The representative added, “Only KT users have problems. What the malware does on the user’s PC is to create strange folders or make file invisible. It completely disables the Webhard program itself. In some cases, the PC itself was also disabled because of it, so we reported it.”</p><p>Police officials acted on the information and discovered it came from KT’s own data center south of Seoul. The authorities say that KT may have violated South Korean laws, including the Protection of Communications Secrets Act and the Information and Communications Network Act. They’ve since identified and charged 13 individuals, including KT employees and subcontractors directly connected to the malware attack last November, but the investigations continue today.</p><p>According to the news report, KT said it directly planted the malware on its customers that use Webhard’s Grid Service, as it was a malicious program and that “it had no choice but to control it.” However, the main problem here wasn’t Webhard’s use of the BitTorrent protocol but the installation of malware on customer computers without consent.</p><p>Webhard and KT have fought in the past over the latter’s use of its Grid Service. The former says that it’s saving tens of billions of Korean Won by allowing its users to use peer-to-peer services to store and transfer data instead of storing it on its servers. On the other hand, the massive number of Grid Service users is straining KT’s network, and the two companies went to court to resolve the issue.</p><p>The judiciary actually ruled in favor of KT. It said that Webhard didn’t pay KT network usage fees for its peer-to-peer system and didn’t explain to its users how the Grid Service works in detail. Therefore, it wasn’t unreasonable for KT to block Webhard’s network traffic.</p><div data-hydrate="true" id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-mujQK3rg8fEA3M9msPzBWa"><section><p>Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.</p></section></div><figure data-bordeaux-image-check=""><div><p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4CxDRwxb8KQdmKW9GkFcTZ-320-80.jpg.webp 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4CxDRwxb8KQdmKW9GkFcTZ-480-80.jpg.webp 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4CxDRwxb8KQdmKW9GkFcTZ-650-80.jpg.webp 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4CxDRwxb8KQdmKW9GkFcTZ-970-80.jpg.webp 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4CxDRwxb8KQdmKW9GkFcTZ-1024-80.jpg.webp 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4CxDRwxb8KQdmKW9GkFcTZ-1200-80.jpg.webp 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)"><img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4CxDRwxb8KQdmKW9GkFcTZ-320-80.jpg" alt="South Korean court ruling on Webhard-KT Case" srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4CxDRwxb8KQdmKW9GkFcTZ-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4CxDRwxb8KQdmKW9GkFcTZ-480-80.jpg 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4CxDRwxb8KQdmKW9GkFcTZ-650-80.jpg 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4CxDRwxb8KQdmKW9GkFcTZ-970-80.jpg 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4CxDRwxb8KQdmKW9GkFcTZ-1024-80.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4CxDRwxb8KQdmKW9GkFcTZ-1200-80.jpg 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)" loading="lazy" data-original-mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4CxDRwxb8KQdmKW9GkFcTZ.jpg" data-pin-media="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4CxDRwxb8KQdmKW9GkFcTZ.jpg"></picture></p></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description"><span itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: JTBC)</span></figcaption></figure><p>But instead of blocking IP addresses, KT nuked Grid Service users with malware.

Its users were more than just inconvenienced; they likely had to deal with computer problems that stemmed from the company’s actions.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post"><article><p>06/26/2024</p><section><p>6 min read</p><div><figure><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2024/06/image2-12.png" alt="Cloudflare incident on June 20, 2024" loading="lazy" width="1600" height="900"></figure><p>polyfill.io, a popular JavaScript library service, can no longer be trusted and should be removed from websites.</p><p><a href="https://sansec.io/research/polyfill-supply-chain-attack">Multiple reports</a>, corroborated with data seen by our own client-side security system, <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/page-shield/">Page Shield</a>, have shown that the polyfill service was being used, and could be used again, to inject malicious JavaScript code into users’ browsers. This is a real threat to the Internet at large given the popularity of this library.</p><p>We have, over the last 24 hours, released an automatic JavaScript URL rewriting service that will rewrite any link to polyfill.io found in a website proxied by Cloudflare <a href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/polyfill/">to a link to our mirror under cdnjs</a>. This will avoid breaking site functionality while mitigating the risk of a supply chain attack.</p><p>Any website on the free plan has this feature automatically activated now. Websites on any paid plan can turn on this feature with a single click.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2024/06/image1-22.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1548" height="322"></figure><p>You can find this new feature under <a href="https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/security/settings">Security ⇒ Settings</a> on any zone using Cloudflare.</p><p>Contrary to what is stated on the polyfill.io website, Cloudflare has never recommended the polyfill.io service or authorized their use of Cloudflare’s name on their website. We have asked them to remove the false statement and they have, so far, ignored our requests. This is yet another warning sign that they cannot be trusted.</p><p>If you are not using Cloudflare today, we still highly recommend that you remove any use of polyfill.io and/or find an alternative solution. And, while the automatic replacement function will handle most cases, the best practice is to remove polyfill.io from your projects and replace it with a secure alternative mirror like Cloudflare’s even if you are a customer.</p><p>You can do this by searching your code repositories for instances of polyfill.io and replacing it with <a href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/polyfill/">cdnjs.cloudflare.com/polyfill/</a> (Cloudflare’s mirror). This is a non-breaking change as the two URLs will serve the same polyfill content. All website owners, regardless of the website using Cloudflare, should do this now.</p><h2 id="how-we-came-to-this-decision">How we came to this decision</h2><p>Back in February, the domain polyfill.io, which hosts a popular JavaScript library, was sold to a new owner: Funnull, a relatively unknown company. <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/polyfill-io-now-available-on-cdnjs-reduce-your-supply-chain-risk">At the time, we were concerned</a> that this created a supply chain risk. This led us to spin up our own mirror of the polyfill.io code hosted under cdnjs, a JavaScript library repository sponsored by Cloudflare.</p><p>The new owner was unknown in the industry and did not have a track record of trust to administer a project such as polyfill.io. The concern, <a href="https://x.com/triblondon/status/1761852117579427975">highlighted even by the original author</a>, was that if they were to abuse polyfill.io by injecting additional code to the library, it could cause far reaching security problems on the Internet affecting several hundreds of thousands websites. Or it could be used to perform a targeted supply-chain attack against specific websites.</p><p>Unfortunately, that worry came true on June 25, 2024 as the polyfill.io service was being used to inject nefarious code that, under certain circumstances, redirected users to other websites.</p><p>We have taken the exceptional step of using our ability to modify HTML on the fly to replace references to the polyfill.io CDN in our customers’ websites with links to our own, safe, mirror created back in February.</p><p>In the meantime, additional threat feed providers have also taken the decision to <a href="https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uAssets/commit/91dfc54aed0f0aa514c1a481c3e63ea16da94c03">flag the domain as malicious</a>. We have not outright blocked the domain through any of the mechanisms we have because we are concerned it could cause widespread web outages given how broadly polyfill.io is used with some estimates indicating <a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/js-polyfillio">usage on nearly 4% of all websites</a>.</p><h3 id="corroborating-data-with-page-shield">Corroborating data with Page Shield</h3><p>The original report indicates that malicious code was injected that, under certain circumstances, would redirect users to betting sites. It was doing this by loading additional JavaScript that would perform the redirect, under a set of additional domains which can be considered Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):</p><pre><code>https://www.googie-anaiytics.com/analytics.js

This was a clear indication that malicious activity was active and associated with polyfill.io.</p><h3 id="replacing-insecure-javascript-links-to-polyfillio">Replacing insecure JavaScript links to polyfill.io</h3><p>To achieve performant HTML rewriting, we need to make blazing-fast HTML alterations as responses stream through Cloudflare’s network. This has been made possible by leveraging <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/rust-nginx-module">ROFL (Response Overseer for FL)</a>. ROFL powers various Cloudflare products that need to alter HTML as it streams, such as <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/speed/optimization/content/fonts/">Cloudflare Fonts,</a> <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/tools/scrape-shield/email-address-obfuscation/">Email Obfuscation</a> and <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/speed/optimization/content/rocket-loader/">Rocket Loader</a></p><p>ROFL is developed entirely in Rust. The memory-safety features of Rust are indispensable for ensuring protection against memory leaks while processing a staggering volume of requests, measuring in the millions per second. Rust's compiled nature allows us to finely optimize our code for specific hardware configurations, delivering performance gains compared to interpreted languages.</p><p>The performance of ROFL allows us to rewrite HTML on-the-fly and modify the polyfill.io links quickly, safely, and efficiently. This speed helps us reduce any additional latency added by processing the HTML file.</p><p>If the feature is turned on, for any HTTP response with an HTML Content-Type, we parse all JavaScript script tag source attributes. If any are found linking to polyfill.io, we rewrite the src attribute to link to our mirror instead. We map to the correct version of the polyfill service while the query string is left untouched.</p><p>The logic will not activate if a Content Security Policy (CSP) header is found in the response. This ensures we don’t replace the link while breaking the CSP policy and therefore potentially breaking the website.</p><h3 id="default-on-for-free-customers-optional-for-everyone-else">Default on for free customers, optional for everyone else</h3><p>Cloudflare proxies millions of websites, and a large portion of these sites are on our free plan. Free plan customers tend to have simpler applications while not having the resources to update and react quickly to security concerns. We therefore decided to turn on the feature by default for sites on our free plan, as the likelihood of causing issues is reduced while also helping keep safe a very large portion of applications using polyfill.io.</p><p>Paid plan customers, on the other hand, have more complex applications and react quicker to security notices. We are confident that most paid customers using polyfill.io and Cloudflare will appreciate the ability to virtually patch the issue with a single click, while controlling when to do so.</p><p>All customers can turn off the feature at any time.</p><p>This isn’t the first time we’ve decided a security problem was so widespread and serious that we’d enable protection for all customers regardless of whether they were a paying customer or not. Back in 2014, we enabled <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/shellshock-protection-enabled-for-all-customers">Shellshock protection</a> for everyone. In 2021, when the log4j vulnerability was disclosed <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cve-2021-44228-log4j-rce-0-day-mitigation/">we rolled out protection</a> for all customers.</p><h2 id="do-not-use-polyfillio">Do not use polyfill.io</h2><p>If you are using Cloudflare, you can remove polyfill.io with a single click on the Cloudflare dashboard by heading over to <a href="https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/security/settings">your zone ⇒ Security ⇒ Settings</a>. If you are a free customer, the rewrite is automatically active. This feature, we hope, will help you quickly patch the issue.</p><p>Nonetheless, you should ultimately search your code repositories for instances of polyfill.io and replace them with an alternative provider, such as Cloudflare’s secure mirror under cdnjs (<a href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/polyfill/">https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/polyfill/</a>).

<h2>Detailed Description of the keyboad PCB</h2>
<p>
<b>The LCD</b> is driven in 4-bit mode to save I/O pins on the My4TH I/O connector. There are only 5 unused
digital outputs available on My4TH's I/O connector, but this is two less than needed to drive the large LCD,
which has two chip select inputs. So it was necessary to add some sort of I/O-port expander to get more digital outputs. 
I did this by adding a 74HC574 octal D-type bus latch. This IC is wired as a 4-bit wide shift register with a depth of 2,
so we get another 8 digital outputs. To clock the data into the shift register, I use the SCL line of the I2C bus.
This is no problem at all for the I2C bus, because the devices on the bus will never see a valid I2C start condition 
when the SCL signal is used to clock the 74HC574. To avoid unwanted register writes to the LCD, the display
has its on select-signal on My4TH's digital I/O port (OUT3). Two resistor-diode AND gates
(R3/D6 and R4/D8) mask the chip selects on the LCD. The small capacitors C2 and C3 are required to filter out glitches
caused by the 74HC574's toggling pins together with the parasitic capacitance of D6 and D8.</p>
<p>
<b>The keyboard</b> has 56 keys. The distance between the keys is 12 mm, so it is not possible to use larger, more confortable keys.
I wanted to have the smallest possible device, and the display forced me to use a minimum width of 190 mm. With a spacing
of 12 mm, 14 keys fit in one row, and with 4 rows we get a total of 56 keys. To read the keys, I use all the unused input pins on
the My4TH's I/O-port connector, which are six in total. Together with 9 digital outputs, I can read a matrix of 6 x 9 = 54 keys.
The remaining two keys are special: I added a shift key (which required another digital output) and a reset key.
The reset key is protected by the shift key, i.e. to trigger a hardware reset you need to press the the reset key together
with the shift key.</p>
<p>
<b>A LiPo battery</b> is used to power the system. The charger circuit is based on the TP5400 chip, which is widely used
in cheap USB power banks. If you find it too difficult to solder the tiny SMD components onto the circuit board,
you can use a pre-assembled TP5400 module and connect it to the keyboard PCB via fly wires.</p>
<p>
<b>The Software support</b> for the keyboard PCB is integrated in the My4TH ROM since version 1.0. So if you connect the
keyboard extension board to your My4TH computer board, your My4TH will automatically detect the keyboard and LCD.</p>
<p>
<b>The PCB</b> is prepared so that it can be cut in half to separate the keyboard from the display. This allows you
to a) mount the display at any angle to the keyboard and b) make your own (possibly more comfortable) keyboard.</p>
<p>
To initiate a <b>hardware reset</b>, hold down the shift key and press the |Reset| key.</p>

<h2>Electrochemical Additive Manufacturing</h2>

<hr></p><div>
<p>Electrochemical Additive Manufacturing (ECAM) is a room-temperature 3D metal printing technology that produces complex, dense metal parts without thermal processing. ECAM builds rapidly at the atomic level from a water-based feedstock containing dissolved metal ions. The electrochemical approach allows for micron-scale feature resolution, complex internal features, high-purity materials, and rapid scalability to support mass manufacturing. We are  working to broaden the market for metal additive manufacturing by providing advanced manufacturing services that displace traditional manufacturing.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>We’re introducing a suite of AI-powered features to help you push past creative blocks and bring your best ideas to life.</p><div colorscheme="[object Object]"><p>Since we first brought <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/introducing-ai-to-figjam/">AI features into FigJam</a>, we’ve been thinking about how to harness the power of AI in Figma. As with everything we do at Figma, our main goal is to give you the tools you need to do your best work—to look beyond the hype and find real solutions to real user problems. Through that lens, we’re excited to introduce Figma AI, a collection of features designed to help you work more efficiently and creatively. Whether you’re searching for inspiration, exploring multiple directions, or looking to automate tedious tasks, we’re building Figma AI to unblock you at&nbsp;any&nbsp;stage.</p><div><p>Our AI features will be free for all users during the beta period, which runs through 2024. As we learn how these tools are used and their underlying costs for Figma, we may need to introduce usage limits for the beta. When Figma AI becomes generally available, we’ll provide clear guidance on pricing. Our goal is to help you work more efficiently while also improving these features in a scalable way.</p></div><h2 id="find-exactly-what-you-need-with-enhanced-search"><a href="#find-exactly-what-you-need-with-enhanced-search">Find exactly what you need with enhanced search</a></h2><p>We know that product designers aren’t always starting from scratch. Many Figma users leverage a production screenshot or try to work with components the team has already created. But locating a specific design or component can feel like searching for a needle in a haystack—especially when working across large organizations with complex design systems. We’re introducing two new ways to help you find the jumping off point that you’re looking for: <strong>Visual Search</strong> and an AI-enhanced <strong>Asset Search</strong>.</p><p><strong>Visual Search</strong> lets you find and reuse designs by uploading an image, selecting an area on your canvas, or entering a text query. Figma will instantly surface visually similar designs from across all your team’s files that you have access to. You can then insert the most relevant frames directly into your working file. In the future, this search capability will extend across our community files, making it easier to find and discover great resources from the&nbsp;community.</p><div><figure><div><p><img src="data:image/png;base64,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" alt="Recipe cards behind a search icon and helper text which reads &quot;Visual search&quot;" width="528" height="422" data-lqip="true"><img data-loading="true" width="528" height="422" loading="lazy" alt="Recipe cards behind a search icon and helper text which reads &quot;Visual search&quot;" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/regionalized/689c1278682ae1b00b39a54e8ae143c7ff819ac8-1080x864.png?rect=0,1,1080,863&amp;w=528&amp;h=422&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/regionalized/689c1278682ae1b00b39a54e8ae143c7ff819ac8-1080x864.png?w=528&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 264w, https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/regionalized/689c1278682ae1b00b39a54e8ae143c7ff819ac8-1080x864.png?w=528&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 396w, https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/regionalized/689c1278682ae1b00b39a54e8ae143c7ff819ac8-1080x864.png?w=528&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format 528w, https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/regionalized/689c1278682ae1b00b39a54e8ae143c7ff819ac8-1080x864.png?w=528&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 792w, https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/regionalized/689c1278682ae1b00b39a54e8ae143c7ff819ac8-1080x864.png?w=528&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1056w"></p></div><figcaption>Instantly find the exact design you need (or uncover new inspiration) by uploading an image and letting Visual Search work its magic.</figcaption></figure></div><div><p>In the future, you’ll be able to also search files and assets from the Figma community directly within the editor. Results will include proper attribution to ensure credit is given to the original creator, and let you access the source file or explore more of the creator’s work.</p></div><p>We’ve also significantly upgraded our existing Asset Search functionality in the <strong>Assets</strong> <strong>panel</strong>. Figma now uses AI to understand the semantic meaning and context behind your search queries, designed to return the most relevant components and assets, even if your search terms don’t exactly match their names. For example, searching for “primary button” should surface relevant button components, even if they’re named something like “btn_large” in your design system. By going beyond simple keyword matching and learning how design elements are typically used, we’re making it easier to find and use components from your design system in a way that feels intuitive and&nbsp;natural.</p><div><figure><div><p><img src="data:image/png;base64,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" alt="A file management interface highlighting options like &quot;Open file,&quot; &quot;Preview,&quot; and &quot;Insert,&quot; showing various blog posts and recipe cards." width="528" height="352" data-lqip="true"><img data-loading="true" width="528" height="352" loading="lazy" alt="A file management interface highlighting options like &quot;Open file,&quot; &quot;Preview,&quot; and &quot;Insert,&quot; showing various blog posts and recipe cards." src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/regionalized/08c006fb3fdd3ec124a84945480fbf46b50b4e92-1608x1072.png?w=528&amp;h=352&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/regionalized/08c006fb3fdd3ec124a84945480fbf46b50b4e92-1608x1072.png?w=528&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 264w, https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/regionalized/08c006fb3fdd3ec124a84945480fbf46b50b4e92-1608x1072.png?w=528&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 396w, https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/regionalized/08c006fb3fdd3ec124a84945480fbf46b50b4e92-1608x1072.png?w=528&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format 528w, https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/regionalized/08c006fb3fdd3ec124a84945480fbf46b50b4e92-1608x1072.png?w=528&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 792w, https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/regionalized/08c006fb3fdd3ec124a84945480fbf46b50b4e92-1608x1072.png?w=528&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1056w"></p></div><figcaption>Say goodbye to racking your brain for exact asset names.

We fine-tuned Visual and Asset Search with images of user interfaces from public, free Community files.</p><p>While we’re proud of the AI features we’ve built so far, we see ways to accelerate your work further by developing new models that work more efficiently and effectively with Figma-specific concepts and tools. To make these improvements, we need to train models that better understand design concepts and patterns, and Figma’s internal formats and structure through Figma&nbsp;content.</p><p>Two important highlights: First, all admins <strong>have control </strong>of whether their team’s content data is used for training. Second, participation in AI content training is not required to use Figma or Figma’s AI features. <a href="https://www.figma.com/ai/our-approach/">Learn more about our approach to&nbsp;training</a>.</p><p>To make these features more useful, the models we use need to be tuned to the specific ways that designers and product teams work in Figma. We’re committed to building this in a principled way that protects your&nbsp;privacy.</p><h3 id="data-privacy-and-protection"><a href="#data-privacy-and-protection">Data privacy and protection</a></h3><p>We know how important your data is to you, your company, and your clients. Our model development process is designed to protect your privacy and confidential information.</p><p>For all customer data,&nbsp;we:</p><ul><li>Encrypt all data at rest and&nbsp;in&nbsp;transit</li><li>Use security measures designed to protect against unauthorized access to customer&nbsp;data</li><li>Enforce tailored permissions and user access controls around who can view and access your&nbsp;data</li></ul><p>We take additional steps to train our models so that they learn general design patterns and Figma-specific concepts and tools—not your content, concepts, and ideas. For example, we de-identify content and redact sensitive information including from text and&nbsp;images.</p><h3 id="ai-model-training"><a href="#ai-model-training">AI model training</a></h3><p>We are introducing a team-level setting where admins can control customer content sharing with Figma for AI training. Customer content includes file content created in or uploaded to Figma by a user, such as layer names and properties, text and images, comments, and annotations. Sharing your customer content with Figma for AI training is <strong>optional</strong> and your team’s setting preference will go into effect on <strong>August 15, 2024</strong>. If an admin turns off content training after that, new content and edits will not be used to train AI&nbsp;models.</p><p>Starting today, admins can set that content data training preference directly in settings, across all&nbsp;plans.</p><ul><li>Starter and Professional plans are opted in by default, but can&nbsp;opt&nbsp;out.</li><li>Organization and Enterprise plans are opted out&nbsp;by&nbsp;default.</li></ul><p>Our customer agreements with Organization and Enterprise are typically more complex and include specific requirements and restrictions, which is why we’ve chosen a different default setting for those&nbsp;plans.</p><p>No content training will occur until August 15, so you have time to decide. Also, any content generated by Figma AI is considered customer content data. You keep your rights to outputs generated when you use&nbsp;Figma&nbsp;AI.</p><p><em>Usage data</em></p><p>Usage data is distinct from customer content and relates to how Figma is accessed and used. Examples of usage data include technical logs, metadata, telemetry data, and information about how your organization’s content is used (like how many times it is accessed), but usage data does not include your content itself. This data is used in an aggregated, de-identified way to help protect your&nbsp;privacy.</p><p><em>Community files data</em></p><p>Free files in the Figma Community are available under licenses that allow transformation but require attribution. What constitutes attribution in the field of AI is a widely debated topic. Until we decide and transparently communicate our approach, generative models that output design will not be trained on Community files. So far, we’ve used public, free Community files only to improve search use cases, like the new semantic and visual search improvements. We will not be doing any training on paid Community files.</p><h3 id="looking-ahead"><a href="#looking-ahead">Looking ahead</a></h3><p>Our goal is to build AI in service of designers and product teams, while being responsible and clear in our approach.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main"><article><div><p>Anthropic's mission is to build reliable, interpretable, steerable AI systems. We have been excited to see our technology used in areas like coding, customer service, drug discovery, and medical research. We're eager to make these tools available through expanded offerings to government users. Leveraging the flexibility and security of Amazon Web Services [AWS], our AI models Claude 3 Haiku and Claude 3 Sonnet are now available in the AWS Marketplace for the US Intelligence Community [IC] and in AWS GovCloud.</p><p>Claude offers a wide range of potential applications for government agencies, both in the present and looking toward the future. Government agencies can use Claude to provide improved citizen services, streamline document review and preparation, enhance policymaking with data-driven insights, and create realistic training scenarios. In the near future, AI could assist in disaster response coordination, enhance public health initiatives, or optimize energy grids for sustainability. Used responsibly, AI has the potential to transform how elected governments serve their constituents and promote peace and security.</p><h3>Adapting to government needs</h3><p>We have been carefully considering the needs of public servants about how Claude could be used to further their missions and the unique needs of government users. In addition to making our models available in the AWS marketplaces that meet stringent government security standards, we are also adapting our service agreements to the unique needs, missions, and legal authorities of governments. </p><p>For example, we have crafted a set of <a href="https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/9528712-exceptions-to-our-usage-policy">contractual exceptions</a> to our general <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/legal/aup">Usage Policy</a> that are carefully calibrated to enable beneficial uses by carefully selected government agencies. These allow Claude to be used for legally authorized foreign intelligence analysis, such as combating human trafficking, identifying covert influence or sabotage campaigns, and providing warning in advance of potential military activities, opening a window for diplomacy to prevent or deter them. All other restrictions in our general <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/legal/aup">Usage Policy</a>, including those concerning disinformation campaigns, the design or use of weapons, censorship, and malicious cyber operations, remain.</p><p>At present, this policy applies only to models that are at AI Safety Level 2 (ASL-2) under our<a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/anthropics-responsible-scaling-policy"> Responsible Scaling Policy</a> (RSP). As we move forward, we commit to regularly evaluating our partnerships and their impacts. Our goal remains constant: ensuring that AI serves the public interest while maintaining our empirical approach to mitigating potential risks.</p><h3>Commitment to responsible AI deployment</h3><p>Since our founding, we have been committed to working to support effective government policies about AI. We have stressed the importance of working with governments to develop <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/third-party-testing">effective testing and measurement regimes</a> and recently provided <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-5-sonnet">pre-release access</a> of Claude 3.5 Sonnet to the UK Artificial Intelligence Safety Institute (UK AISI), which conducted pre deployment testing and shared their results with US AI Safety Institute (US AISI). We believe working with governments is essential to ensuring the world safely makes the transition toward transformative AI and are committed to working toward this goal.</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

  

  <article>
    <p>There’s a sort of breathless industry-specific fact in software that goes around every so often.</p>

<p>Revenue, and the underlying source of revenue, in the consumer web, whether impressions or sales, tracks remarkably closely to lower latency. This is from avoiding bounces, making conversion better, etc.</p>

<p>Here are some articles saying this breathlessly:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gigaspaces.com/blog/amazon-found-every-100ms-of-latency-cost-them-1-in-sales/">Amazon Found Every 100ms of Latency Cost them 1% in Sales</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/marketing-resources/data-measurement/mobile-page-speed-new-industry-benchmarks/">Find out how you stack up to new industry benchmarks for mobile page speed</a></p>

<p><a href="https://neilpatel.com/blog/loading-time/">How Loading Time Affects Your Bottom Line</a></p>

<p>But if folks make more money off of customers when they reduce latency, there has to be some power in increasing latency.</p>

<p>I actually found something some months ago. It stems from my own usage of the consumer web.</p>

<p>Nearly everyone who writes software uses the consumer web, often to excess.</p>

<p>I, as a bonafide computer toucher, am no exception.</p>

<p>In fact, I use the web to ridiculous excess. There are 24-hour periods of my life where I was using that consumer web for 24 hours (my coworker asked, “weren’t you worried about blood clots?” - you walk around).</p>

<p>But addiction is really the converse of bouncing from a site.</p>

<p>So if you can inject latency into sites artificially, you can reduce the actual impact of the addiction in a controllable way while not denying the enjoyment of the Internet to yourself.</p>

<p>Hacker News with 100ms latency feels like liquor: Hacker News with 9000ms latency feels like small beer.</p>

<p>Reddit with 150ms latency feels like cocaine: Reddit with 8000ms latency feels like coffee.</p>

<p>Blocking tends towards the inducement of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactance_(psychology)">psychological reactance</a>.</p>

<p>This just feels like a beneficial dilution of the Internet. It feels like wine to the ancient Greeks, who drank wine but attacked the practice of drinking undiluted wine as tantamount to barbarism.</p>

<h2 id="doing-it">Doing It</h2>

<p>You get the web from 2 basic kinds of nightmare rectangle: laptops and desktops, where you control a material portion of the computing environment, or mobile and tablets, where you control less.</p>

<p>Your best bet for a web browser in a laptop or desktop is <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/crackbook-revival/fakedinbmdjifniaepnfbplcheaecebc?hl=en">Crackbook Revival</a>. It has a fully configurable site list and has an option for linearly increasing the amount of latency upon more viewing.</p>

<p>Simon HE emailed me saying that you can use <a href="https://github.com/OskarDamkjaer/FirefoxDelayWebpage">this Firefox extension</a> if you’re on Firefox.</p>

<p>For the other applications in the laptop or desktop, turn on <a href="https://www.charlesproxy.com/">Charles Proxy</a>, and use its <a href="https://www.charlesproxy.com/documentation/proxying/throttling/">throttling functionality</a>. Instead of its intended purpose as developer tools, you can just turn it on permanently.</p>

<p>On iOS, turn on the developer mode and then turn on the <a href="https://nshipster.com/network-link-conditioner/">network link conditioner</a> permanently.</p>

<p>Android is the hardest to do this in. Either turn on Charles Proxy on a proxy that the Android connection goes through (only possible over wifi), or tether to an entire different iphone which has the network link conditioner on.</p>

<h2 id="other-possible-dilutions">Other possible dilutions</h2>

<p>If it has been put on websites by some folks like me, and seems like an inducement to get you to do things on the Web, it is probably amenable to blocking, latency reduction, or some other sort of mutilation that will allow you to resume being a normal human being in some way.</p>

<p>I am very far along this sort of cult of mutilation. You don’t have to follow me, but here is what I do.</p>

<p>I have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Deleted all variable pictures from YouTube with my adblock. The avatars of the people, the teaser images with people making obnoxious faces on them, the logo, etc.</li>
  <li>Not even considered the possibility of browsing the web without adblock anymore (the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en">good stuff</a>, too)</li>
  <li>Used an <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hide-youtube-comments/kehdmnjmaakacofbgmjgjapbbibhafoh">extension</a> to remove all the comments from Youtube</li>
  <li>Coerced old-style on Reddit without an infinite scroll</li>
  <li>Withdrawn mostly from Reddit in favor of early 2000’s style forums that I pay money for and HN</li>
  <li>Deleted Facebook with especial, complicated and sophisticated prejudice which I will not detail here</li>
</ul>

<p>It is true I have watered down my perception of the Internet. I have watered down the Internet because nowadays it only seems to come in 151 proof.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-element="story-body" data-dateline="" data-subscriber-content="">  <p><span>WASHINGTON&nbsp;—&nbsp;</span></p><p>The Supreme Court on Wednesday struck down part of a federal anti-corruption law that makes it a crime for state and local officials to take gifts valued at more than $5,000 from a donor who had previously been awarded lucrative contracts or other government benefits thanks to the efforts of the official.</p><p>By a 6-3 vote, the justices<a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-108_8n5a.pdf" target="_blank"> overturned the conviction of a former Indiana mayor </a>who asked for and took a $13,000 payment from the owners of a local truck dealership after he helped them win $1.1 million in city contracts for the purchase of garbage trucks. </p><p>In ruling for the former mayor, the justices drew a distinction between bribery, which requires proof of an illegal deal, and a gratuity that can be a gift or a reward for a past favor. They said the officials may be charged and prosecuted for bribery, but not for taking money for past favors if there was no proof of an illicit deal. </p><p>“The question in this case is whether [the federal law] also makes it a crime for state and local officials to accept gratuities — for example, gift cards, lunches, plaques, books, framed photos or the like — that may be given as a token of appreciation after the official act. The answer is no,” said Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, writing for the majority.</p><p>Despite his reference to token gifts such as lunches and framed photos, the federal law was triggered only by payments of more than $5,000.</p><p>But the court’s conservative majority said the law in question was a “bribery statute, not a gratuities law.” Kavanaugh said federal law “leaves it to state and local governments to regulate gratuities to state and local officials.”</p><p>Justices Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented. </p><p>“Officials who use their public positions for private gain threaten the integrity of our most important institutions,” Jackson wrote in dissent. </p><p>She said the mayor’s “absurd and atextual reading of the statute is one only today’s court could love.”</p><p>The law as written “poses no genuine threat to common gift giving,” she said, but it “clearly covers the kind of corrupt (albeit perhaps non-quid pro quo) payment [the mayor] solicited after steering the city contracts to the dealership.”</p><p>The ruling could have a broad impact. About 20 million local and state officials are covered by the federal anti-corruption law, including officials at hospitals and universities that receive federal funds.</p><p>Justice Department lawyers told the court that for nearly 40 years, the anti-bribery law has been understood to prohibit payments to officials that “rewarded” them for having steered contracts to the donors. But there are few prosecutions that rely entirely on an after-the-fact payment, they said. </p><p>The Supreme Court justices have faced heavy criticism recently for accepting undisclosed gifts from wealthy patrons. Justice Clarence Thomas regularly took lavish vacations and private jet flights that were paid for by Texas billionaire Harlan Crow. Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. took a fishing trip to Alaska in 2008 aboard a private plane owned by Paul Singer, a hedge fund billionaire. </p><p>The high court has long held that criminal laws restricting “illegal gratuities” to federal officials require proof that the gifts were given for a specific “official act,” not just because of the official’s position. </p><p>The Indiana mayor was charged and convicted of taking the $13,000 payment because of his role in helping his patrons win city contracts. </p><p>Congress in 1986 extended the federal bribery law to cover officials of state or local agencies that receive federal funds. The measure made it a crime to “corruptly solicit or demand ... or accept ... anything of value of $5,000 or more ... intending to be influenced or rewarded in connection with any business or transaction.” </p><p>Prosecutors said James Snyder was heavily in debt and behind in paying his taxes when he became mayor of Portage, Ind., in 2012. The city needed new garbage trucks, and the mayor took over the required public bidding. He spoke regularly with two brothers who owned a local truck dealership that also had financial problems, and he designed the bidding process so that only their two new trucks would meet all of its standards. He also arranged to have the city buy an older truck that was on their lot.</p><p>Two weeks after the contracts were final, the mayor went to see the two brothers and told them of his financial troubles. They agreed to write him a check for $13,000 for undefined consulting services. </p><p>An FBI investigation led to Snyder’s indictment, his conviction and a 21-month prison sentence. </p><p>The former mayor argued that an after-the-fact gift should not be a crime, but he lost before a federal judge and the U.S. appeals court in Chicago.</p><p>The high court agreed to hear<a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/snyder-v-united-states/" target="_blank"> his appeal in Snyder vs. U.S.</a> because appeals courts in Boston and New Orleans had limited the law to bribery only and not gratuities that were paid later. </p><p>In recent years, the Supreme Court has repeatedly limited the scope of public corruption laws and often in unanimous rulings. The common theme is that the justices concluded the prosecutions went beyond the law. </p><p>Last year, the court was unanimous in overturning the corruption convictions of two New York men who were former aides or donors to then-Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat. The court noted that one of the defendants convicted of taking illicit payments did not work for the state during that time.</p><p>Four years ago, the justices were unanimous in overturning the convictions of two aides to then-New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican, who were charged with conspiring to shut down lanes to the George Washington Bridge into New York City. The court said they were wrongly convicted of fraud because they had not sought money or property, which is a key element of a fraud charge.</p><p>In 2016, the court overturned the corruption conviction of former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell, a Republican. While the governor took $175,000 in gifts from a business promoter, he took no official actions to benefit the donor, the court said. </p><div data-list-id="0000018c-4558-d70f-adfc-c77d3e520002" data-module-id="0000018c-4558-d70f-adfc-c77d3e520002" data-click="enhancement" data-align-center="">  <p data-element="element-header" data-click="liZZListTitleCTA">  <h3 data-element="element-header-title" data-counter="3">More to Read </h3>  </p>      </div> </div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  <p>I sometimes think of my computer as a very large house. I visit this house
every day and know most of the rooms on the ground floor, but there are
bedrooms I’ve never been in, closets I haven’t opened, nooks and crannies that
I’ve never explored. I feel compelled to learn more about my computer the same
way anyone would feel compelled to see a room they had never visited in their
own home.</p>

<p>GNU Readline is an unassuming little software library that I relied on for
years without realizing that it was there. Tens of thousands of people probably
use it every day without thinking about it. If you use the Bash shell, every
time you auto-complete a filename, or move the cursor around within a single
line of input text, or search through the history of your previous commands,
you are using GNU Readline. When you do those same things while using the
command-line interface to Postgres (<code>psql</code>), say, or the Ruby REPL
(<code>irb</code>), you are again using GNU Readline. Lots of software depends on the GNU
Readline library to implement functionality that users expect, but the
functionality is so auxiliary and unobtrusive that I imagine few people stop to
wonder where it comes from.
<!--more--></p>

<p>GNU Readline was originally created in the 1980s by the Free Software
Foundation. Today, it is an important if invisible part of everyone’s computing
infrastructure, maintained by a single volunteer.</p>

<h2 id="feature-replete">Feature Replete</h2>
<p>The GNU Readline library exists primarily to augment any command-line interface
with a common set of keystrokes that allow you to move around within and edit a
single line of input. If you press <code>Ctrl-A</code> at a Bash prompt, for example, that
will jump your cursor to the very beginning of the line, while pressing
<code>Ctrl-E</code> will jump it to the end. Another useful command is <code>Ctrl-U</code>, which
will delete everything in the line before the cursor.</p>

<p>For an embarrassingly long time, I moved around on the command line by
repeatedly tapping arrow keys. For some reason, I never imagined that there was
a faster way to do it. Of course, no programmer familiar with a text editor
like Vim or Emacs would deign to punch arrow keys for long, so something like
Readline was bound to be created. Using Readline, you can do much more than
just jump around—you can edit your single line of text as if you were using a
text editor. There are commands to delete words, transpose words, upcase words,
copy and paste characters, etc. In fact, most of Readline’s
keystrokes/shortcuts are based on Emacs. Readline is essentially Emacs for a
single line of text. You can even record and replay macros.</p>

<p>I have never used Emacs, so I find it hard to remember what all the
different Readline commands are. But one thing about Readline that is really
neat is that you can switch to using a Vim-based mode instead. To do this for
Bash, you can use the <code>set</code> builtin. The following will tell Readline
to use Vim-style commands for the current shell:</p>



<p>With this option enabled, you can delete words using <code>dw</code> and so on. The
equivalent to <code>Ctrl-U</code> in the Emacs mode would be <code>d0</code>.</p>

<p>I was excited to try this when I first learned about it, but I’ve found that it
doesn’t work so well for me. I’m happy that this concession to Vim users
exists, and you might have more luck with it than me, particularly if you
haven’t already used Readline’s default command keystrokes. My problem is that,
by the time I heard about the Vim-based interface, I had already learned
several Readline keystrokes. Even with the Vim option enabled, I keep using the
default keystrokes by mistake. Also, without some sort of indicator, Vim’s
modal design is awkward here—it’s very easy to forget which mode you’re in. So
I’m stuck at a local maximum using Vim as my text editor but Emacs-style
Readline commands. I suspect a lot of other people are in the same position.</p>

<p>If you feel, not unreasonably, that both Vim and Emacs’ keyboard command
systems are bizarre and arcane, you can customize Readline’s key bindings and
make them whatever you like. This is not hard to do. Readline reads a
<code>~/.inputrc</code> file on startup that can be used to configure various options and
key bindings. One thing I’ve done is reconfigured <code>Ctrl-K</code>. Normally it deletes
from the cursor to the end of the line, but I rarely do that. So I’ve instead
bound it so that pressing <code>Ctrl-K</code> deletes the whole line, regardless of where
the cursor is. I’ve done that by adding the following to <code>~/.inputrc</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code>Control-k: kill-whole-line
</code></pre></div>

<p>Each Readline command (the documentation refers to them as <em>functions</em>) has a
name that you can associate with a key sequence this way. If you edit
<code>~/.inputrc</code> in Vim, it turns out that Vim knows the filetype and will
help you by highlighting valid function names but not invalid ones!</p>

<p>Another thing you can do with <code>~/.inputrc</code> is create canned macros by mapping
key sequences to input strings. <a href="https://tiswww.case.edu/php/chet/readline/readline.html">The Readline
manual</a> gives one
example that I think is especially useful. I often find myself wanting to save
the output of a program to a file, which means that I often append something
like <code>&gt; output.txt</code> to Bash commands. To save some time, you could make this a
Readline macro:</p>

<div><pre><code>Control-o: "&gt; output.txt"
</code></pre></div>

<p>Now, whenever you press <code>Ctrl-O</code>, you’ll see that <code>&gt; output.txt</code> gets added
after your cursor on the command line. Neat!</p>

<p>But with macros you can do more than just create shortcuts for
strings of text. The following entry in <code>~/.inputrc</code> means that, every time I
press <code>Ctrl-J</code>, any text I already have on the line is surrounded by <code>$(</code> and
<code>)</code>. The macro moves to the beginning of the line with <code>Ctrl-A</code>, adds <code>$(</code>,
then moves to the end of the line with <code>Ctrl-E</code> and adds <code>)</code>:</p>



<p>This might be useful if you often need the output of one command to use for
another, such as in:</p>


<p>The <code>~/.inputrc</code> file also allows you to set different values for what the
Readline manual calls <em>variables</em>. These enable or disable certain Readline
behaviors. You can use these variables to change, for example, how Readline
auto-completion works or how the Readline history search works. One variable
I’d recommend turning on is the <code>revert-all-at-newline</code> variable, which by
default is off. When the variable is off, if you pull a line from your command
history using the reverse search feature, edit it, but then decide to search
instead for another line, the edit you made is preserved in the history. I find
this confusing because it leads to lines showing up in your Bash command
history that you never actually ran. So add this to your <code>~/.inputrc</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code>set revert-all-at-newline on
</code></pre></div>

<p>When you set options or key bindings using <code>~/.inputrc</code>, they apply wherever
the Readline library is used. This includes Bash most obviously, but you’ll
also get the benefit of your changes in other programs like <code>irb</code> and <code>psql</code>
too! A Readline macro that inserts <code>SELECT * FROM</code> could be useful if you often
use command-line interfaces to relational databases.</p>

<h2 id="chet-ramey">Chet Ramey</h2>
<p>GNU Readline is today maintained by Chet Ramey, a Senior Technology Architect
at Case Western Reserve University. Ramey also maintains the Bash shell. Both
projects were first authored by a Free Software Foundation employee named Brian
Fox beginning in 1988. But Ramey has been the sole maintainer since around
1994.</p>

<p>Ramey told me via email that Readline, far from being an original idea, was
created to implement functionality prescribed by the POSIX specification, which
in the late 1980s had just been created. Many earlier shells, including the
Korn shell and at least one version of the Unix System V shell, included line
editing functionality. The 1988 version of the Korn shell (<code>ksh88</code>) provided
both Emacs-style and Vi/Vim-style editing modes. As far as I can tell from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151105130220/http://www2.research.att.com/sw/download/man/man1/ksh88.html">the
manual
page</a>,
the Korn shell would decide which mode you wanted to use by looking at the
<code>VISUAL</code> and <code>EDITOR</code> environment variables, which is pretty neat. The parts of
POSIX that specified shell functionality were closely modeled on <code>ksh88</code>, so
GNU Bash was going to have to implement a similarly flexible line-editing
system to stay compliant. Hence Readline.</p>

<p>When Ramey first got involved in Bash development, Readline was a single source
file in the Bash project directory. It was really just a part of Bash. Over
time, the Readline file slowly moved toward becoming an independent project,
though it was not until 1994 (with the 2.0 release of Readline) that Readline
became a separate library entirely.</p>

<p>Readline is closely associated with Bash, and Ramey usually pairs Readline
releases with Bash releases. But as I mentioned above, Readline is a library
that can be used by any software implementing a command-line interface. And
it’s really easy to use. This is a simple example, but here’s how you would you
use Readline in your own C program. The string argument to the <code>readline()</code>
function is the prompt that you want Readline to display to the user:</p>

<div><pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include "readline/readline.h"

int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
    char* line = readline("my-rl-example&gt; ");
    printf("You entered: \"%s\"\n", line);

    free(line);

    return 0;
}
</code></pre></div>

<p>Your program hands off control to Readline, which is responsible for getting a
line of input from the user (in such a way that allows the user to do all the
fancy line-editing things). Once the user has actually submitted the line,
Readline returns it to you. I was able to compile the above by linking against
the Readline library, which I apparently have somewhere in my library search
path, by invoking the following:</p>



<p>The Readline API is much more extensive than that single function of course,
and anyone using it can tweak all sorts of things about the library’s behavior.
Library users can even add new functions that end users can configure via
<code>~/.inputrc</code>, meaning that Readline is very easy to extend. But, as far as I
can tell, even Bash ultimately calls the simple <code>readline()</code> function to get
input just as in the example above, though there is a lot of configuration
beforehand. (See <a href="https://github.com/bminor/bash/blob/9f597fd10993313262cab400bf3c46ffb3f6fd1e/parse.y#L1487">this
line</a>
in the source for GNU Bash, which seems to be where Bash hands off
responsibility for getting input to Readline.)</p>

<p>Ramey has now worked on Bash and Readline for well over a decade. He has never
once been compensated for his work—he is and has always been a volunteer. Bash
and Readline continue to be actively developed, though Ramey said that Readline
changes much more slowly than Bash does. I asked Ramey what it was like being
the sole maintainer of software that so many people use. He said that millions
of people probably use Bash without realizing it (because every Apple device
runs Bash), which makes him worry about how much disruption a breaking change
might cause. But he’s slowly gotten used to the idea of all those people out
there. He said that he continues to work on Bash and Readline because at this

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>The polyfill.io domain is being used to infect more than 100,000 websites with malware after a Chinese organization bought the domain earlier this year.</p>
<p>Multiple security firms sounded the alarm on Tuesday, warning organizations whose websites use any JavaScript code from the polyfill.io domain to immediately remove it.</p>
<p>The site offered <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Polyfill">polyfills</a> – useful bits of JavaScript code that add functionality to older browsers that is built into newer versions. These in-fills make life easier for developers in that by using polyfillers, they know their web code will work across a greater range of browsers.</p>

    

<p>Now we're told polyfill.io is serving malicious code hidden in those scripts, meaning anyone visiting a website using the domain will end up running that malware in their browser.</p>

        


        

<p>"The cdn.polyfill.io domain is currently being used in a web supply chain attack," security monitoring biz c/side's Carlo D'Agnolo <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cside.dev/blog/more-than-100k-websites-targeted-in-web-supply-chain-attack">said</a> in an advisory. "It used to host a service for adding JavaScript polyfills to websites, but is now inserting malicious code in scripts served to end-users."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, we understand Google has started blocking Google Ads for websites that use the impacted code presumably to reduce traffic to them and cut the number of potential victims. Affected site owners have also been alerted by the internet giant.</p>

        

<p>"We detected a security issue recently that may affect websites using certain third-party libraries," a Google spokesperson told <em>The Register</em>. "To help potentially impacted advertisers secure their websites, we have been proactively sharing information on how to quickly mitigate the issue."</p>
<p>Sites that embed poisoned scripts from polyfill.io and also bootcss.com may end up unexpectedly redirecting visitors away from the intended location, and send them to malicious sites, Google <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/spazef0rze/status/1805645015663673670">told</a> advertisers.</p>
<p>More than <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://publicwww.com/websites/%22cdn.polyfill.io%22/">100,000 sites</a> are already carrying the hostile scripts, according to the Sansec security forensics team, which on Tuesday claimed Funnull, a Chinese CDN operator that bought the polyfill.io domain and its associated GitHub account in February, has since been using the service in a supply chain attack.</p>

        

<p>Polyfill.io is used by academic library JSTOR as well as Intuit, World Economic Forum, and tons more.</p>
<p>Since February, "this domain was caught injecting <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240624110153/https://github.com/polyfillpolyfill/polyfill-service/issues/2873">malware</a> on mobile devices via any site that embeds cdn.polyfill.io," Sansec, an e-commerce security company, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://sansec.io/research/polyfill-supply-chain-attack">warned</a>, adding that any <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240229113710/https://github.com/polyfillpolyfill/polyfill-service/issues/2834">complaints</a> about the malicious activity are quickly vanished from the GitHub repository.</p>
<p>"The polyfill code is dynamically generated based on the HTTP headers, so multiple attack vectors are likely," Sansec noted.</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/05/03/it_might_take_a_decade/">It may take decade to shore up software supply chain security, says infosec CEO</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/03/26/corejs_maintainer_jailed_code_release/">What happens when the maintainer of a JS library downloaded 26m times a week goes to prison for killing someone with a motorbike? Core-js just found out</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/03/25/python_package_malware/">Over 170K users caught up in poisoned Python package ruse</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/03/17/ai_supply_chain/">In the rush to build AI apps, please, please don't leave security behind</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In fact, Andrew Betts, who created the open source polyfill service project in the mid-2010s, told people earlier this year to not use polyfill.io at all. As we understand it, Betts maintained the project and contributed to its GitHub repo until a few years ago, arguing now that it's really no longer needed.</p>
<p>In February, he said he had nothing to do with the domain name's sale, and presumably the associated GitHub repo, to the Chinese CDN, and urged everyone to remove its code from their webpages as a precaution following the change in ownership.</p>
<p>"If you own a website, loading a script implies an incredible relationship of trust with that third party," he <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/triblondon/status/1761852117579427975">Xeeted</a> at the time. "Do you actually trust them?"</p>
<p>Soon after other popular CDN providers including <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://community.fastly.com/t/new-options-for-polyfill-io-users/2540">Fastly</a>, where Betts works today, and <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/polyfill">Cloudflare</a> created <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://polykill.io/">mirrors</a> of polyfill.io so that sites could continue to use the code for the meanwhile without having to load in stuff from a Chinese entity.</p>
<p>"The concerns are that any website embedding a link to the original polyfill.io domain will now be relying on Funnull to maintain and secure the underlying project to avoid the risk of a supply chain attack," Cloudflare's Sven Sauleau and Michael Tremante <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/polyfill-io-now-available-on-cdnjs-reduce-your-supply-chain-risk">said</a> in February.</p>
<p>"Such an attack would occur if the underlying third party is compromised or alters the code being served to end users in nefarious ways, causing, by consequence, all websites using the tool to be compromised," they added.</p>
<p>Now that seems to be the case. ®</p>

<p dir="auto"><strong>Important:</strong> The Docker image of r2r operates in server and client mode, with the server being the Docker container and the client being your PC. This means you need to append <code>--client_server_mode</code> to all your queries.</p>
<p dir="auto">Additionally, your PC (acting as the client) needs to have Python, Pip, and the dependencies listed in the r2r folder of the repository. Therefore, you need to have the repository cloned on your computer and run <code>pip install r2r</code> in the root folder of the cloned repository.</p>
<p dir="auto">You have the option to run the client inside the terminal of the Docker container (to have everything in one place), but the use of <code>pip install r2r</code> and <code>--client_server_mode</code> is necessary.</p>

Adam Mayer tested different stride widths and found that at 67 bytes (536 pixels across) there appeared to be some sort of image data that clearly was a picture of people. The rest of the image was skewed and distorted, so we knew that it wasn’t stored as an uncompressed bitmap.</p>
<p>After some investigation, we were able to decode the scrambled mess above and turn it into the full image with a hidden message from “<tt>Thu, Nov 20, 1986</tt>“:</p>

<p>Read on for the reverse engineering details of how we recovered this and the other three photographs stored in the ROM, and some information about the Motorola 68000 era Macintosh.<br>

<p>We found this Macintosh SE on the side of the road in Brooklyn and carried it to NYC Resistor. It boots, but lacks any media, so we decided to do some further digital archeology.</p>

<p>We removed the two ROM chips (the ones in the middle of the board, above the VLSI ASIC that is the Integrated Woz Machine) and dumped them with my <a href="https://bitbucket.org/hudson/prom/">PROMdate</a> device. The pinout for the chips is the same as the M27C512 PROM, but with the <tt>Vpp</tt> pin reused for A17. Since it is a mask ROM that can’t be reprogrammed there is no need for the programming pin (Thanks, Nick!). This exapnds the address space to 128 KB (1024 kilobits) compared to the 64 KB of the M27C512 programmable ROM.</p>

<p>The m68k has a 16-bit wide bus, so each 128 KB 8-bit ROM has half a word and they need to be merged into a single 256 KB binary file. We knew we had a good dump and merge when <tt>strings</tt> on the file contained human readable textlike “<tt>Chicago</tt>“, “<tt>PACK</tt>” and “<tt>CDEF</tt>” (if you have the byte order wrong these will be “<tt>APKC</tt>“, etc).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.eeggs.com/items/2258.html">Reports of the easter egg</a> said that it could be found by jumping to address <tt>0x41D89A</tt>. I was able to boot the ROMs in <a href="http://minivmac.sourceforge.net/">Mini vMac</a> and confirm that these were indeed the secret images that had already been discovered. That could have been the end of it, but we wanted to know how they were stored and displayed, and to be able to look for any other surprises stored in the ROM, so further investigation was required.</p>
<p>To disassemble the ROM, I found it easiest to convert the raw binary dump to an ELF file so that <tt>objdump</tt> will process it. We know from history that the ROM was mapped to address <tt>0x0040_0000</tt> (24 MB) in memory, so we set the starting address of the ELF file there. IDA Pro is another great tool for doing exactly this sort of reverse engineering, but we’re using free software for this analysis.</p>
<pre>m68k-elf-objcopy

  -I binary 
  -O elf32-m68k 
  -B m68k 
  roms/mac-se.bin 
  roms/mac-se.elf 
</pre>
<p>Looking at the easter egg function address with <tt>m68k-elf-objdump -D roms/mac-se.elf</tt>, we see:</p>
<pre>  41d89a:       4eba 0018       jsr %pc@(41d8b4 &lt;rom+0x1d8b4&gt;)
  41d89e:       5847            addqw #4,%d7
  41d8a0:       0287 0000 000c  andil #12,%d7
  41d8a6:       6100 002e       bsrw 41d8d6 &lt;rom+0x1d8d6&gt;
  41d8aa:       307c 00b5       moveaw #181,%a0
  41d8ae:       <b>a03b</b>            0120073
  41d8b0:       4efa ffec       jmp %pc@(41d89e &lt;rom+0x1d89e&gt;)
</pre>
<p>The <tt>0xa03b</tt> instruction is odd — Motorola reserved all instructions that start with <tt>0xA</tt>, so this it is not a legal m68k instruction. Instead it will trigger an illegal instruction trap, and the trap handler looks at the next word and vectors to the appropriate handler. This A-line or A-trap is the official way to enter the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_Toolbox">Macintosh Toolbox</a> and saves significant code space over the normal system call methods. <a href="http://www.mac.linux-m68k.org/devel/macalmanac.php">This list of codes</a> tells us that it is <tt>_Delay</tt> and that the value in <tt>%a0</tt> will be used as an argument for how long to delay. We’ll be refering to this list again to understand what is going on in the assembly code.<br>
Based on this we can translate this function into something like “C”:</p>
<pre>void easter_egg(void)
{
    func_41d8b4();
    while (1)
    {
        d7 = (d7 + 4) &amp; 0xC;
        func_0x41d8d6();
        _Delay(181);
    }
}
</pre>
<p>The first function that this calls is <tt>0x41d8b4</tt>:</p>
<pre>  41d8b4:       31fc ffff 0b9e  movew #-1,b9e
  41d8ba:       594f            subqw #4,%sp
  41d8bc:       2f3c 6262 6d63  movel #1650617699,%sp@-

  41d8c4:       a9a0            0124640
  41d8c6:       201f            movel %sp@+,%d0
  41d8c8:       6700 0050       beqw 41d91a &lt;rom+0x1d91a&gt;
  41d8cc:       2040            moveal %d0,%a0
  41d8ce:       21d0 0a78       movel %a0@,a78
  41d8d2:       7e00            moveq #0,%d7
  41d8d4:       4e75            rts
...
  41d91a:       a9ff            0124777
</pre>
<p>This makes the A-line call <tt>0xA9A0</tt>, or <tt>_GetResource(0x62626d63)</tt> and sets <tt>0xb9e</tt>, the <tt>RomInsertFlag</tt> to instruct the search function to look in the ROM tables. If the resource get fails it jumps to a debugger trap (<tt>0xA9FF</tt>), which halts the machine. Otherwise it zeros <tt>%d7</tt> and reads the address of the resource from the address returned by <tt>_GetResource</tt> and writes that value into the global memory location <tt>0xa78</tt> (<tt>AppleScratch</tt>).</p>
<p>If you speak ASCII, the constant might look interesting. It is a multi-byte character ‘<tt>bbmc</tt>‘, which you might have noticed in the <tt>strings</tt> output at offset <tt>0x1af4e</tt>, in what appears to be some sort of structure:</p>

</pre>
<p>As of now we don’t know how to decode the structure, nor what <tt>%a0</tt> points to when it is dereferenced into the global at <tt>0xa78</tt>. We’ll come back to that later, but it clearly has something to do with <tt>0x009A</tt> and the bit in red at <tt>0x1AFDA</tt>.</p>
<p>Moving on to <tt>func_0x41d8d6()</tt>, with psudeo-code interspersed:</p>
<pre>  41d8d6:       moveal a78,%a0
  41d8da:       addaw %d7,%a0
  41d8dc:       movel %a0@,%d3     d3 = _a78[d7];
  41d8de:       movel a78,a7c
  41d8e4:       addl %d3,a7c       _a7c = _a78 + d3;
  41d8e8:       movel 824,a80      _a80 = _824 // ScrnBase
  41d8ee:       movel #340,%d3     d3 = 340;
                                   do {
  41d8f4:       pea a7c
  41d8f8:       pea a80
  41d8fc:       movew #72,%sp@-        // 72 * 8 == 576 bits
  41d900:       a8d0                   _UnpackBits(&amp;_a7c, &amp;_a80, 72)
  41d902:       subql #8,a80           _a80 -= 8;
  41d906:       dbf %d3,41d8f4     } while (d3--)
  41d90a:       pea a7c
  41d90e:       pea a80
  41d912:       movew #64,%sp@-
  41d916:       a8d0                _Unpackbits(&amp;_a7c, &amp;_a80, 64);
  41d918:       rts                 return;
</pre>
<p>Rewriting these three functions entire code in something more like C:</p>
<pre>void draw_bitmap(const uint8_t * packed)
{
	uint8_t * fb = _ScrnBase;

	for (int y = 0 ; y &lt; 340 ; y++)
	{
		_UnpackBits(&amp;packed, &amp;fb, 72);
		fb -= 8;
	}

	_UnpackBits(&amp;packed, &amp;fb, 64);
}

void easter_egg(void)
{
	const uint8_t ** bbmc = _GetResource('bbmc');
	if (!bbmc)
		halt();
	int image = 0;

	while (1)
	{
		draw_bitmap(bbmc[i]);
		i = (i + 1) % 4;
		_Delay(181);
	}
}
</pre>
<p>Adam found the format expected by <tt>_UnpackBits</tt> defined in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PackBits">PackBits on wikipedia</a>, and wrote a <a href="https://github.com/phooky/PROM/blob/master/tools/unpackbits.py">python unpackbits.py</a> that can be given the offsets of the images in the ROM. So the last piece of the puzzle was to figure out where they are located.</p>
<p>And this is where I cheated… Based on a binary search of the image space using <tt>unpackbits.py</tt>, I found that the first one started at <tt>0x1d93c</tt>. Looking slightly earlier in the ROM dump, I saw:</p>
<pre>001d920: 0000 0064 0000 <b>0018</b> 0000 <b>5618</b> 0000 <b>a71c</b>  ...d......V.....
001d930: 0000 <b>f700</b> 0001 4281 0000 0000 30aa 552a  ......B.....0.U*
001d940: 52a5 294a 5294 a529 4a52 2449 1224 44a9  R.)JR..)JR$I.$D.
</pre>
<p>That <tt>0x0000_0018</tt> looks right; <tt>0x1D924 + 0x18 = 0x1D93C</tt>. And immediately afterwards are additional offsets that look like the right spacing for the other bitmaps. That puts the others at <tt>0x22F3C</tt>, <tt>0x28040</tt>, <tt>0x2D024</tt> and something unused at <tt>0x31BA5</tt>. Looking back at the ROM dump from the region of the resource definition, we even see an offset that points to <tt>0x5801D924</tt>. (Don’t be fooled by the leading <tt>0x58</tt> — the Mac SE only had 24-bit addresses, so it will be ignored by the CPU).</p>
<p>Running Adam’s tool, combined with my <tt>hex2png</tt> on the regions produced success for the four images!</p>
<pre>for offset in 1D93C 22F3C 28040 2D024; do
  off_decimal=`echo 16i $offset p | dc`
  ../unpackbits.py $off_decimal 5000 &lt; mac-se.bin 
	| ../hex2png -w 576 -y 384 -s 24576 
	| convert -crop 512x341+0+0 - 0x$offset.png  
done
</pre>
<p>So here is the team that twenty five years ago found space in the ROM to include their own images as an easter egg. Can anyone identify them? Where are they now? Are they “<tt>JCSLWRLBBMABOEMTDAHJTCFJLMBKCRCLAKEHBRDCDAFSHFT</tt>“? If you do know who they are, please send them our thanks for a fun puzzle!</p>

<p>What is in that fifth region? It didn’t seem to have any image data of note, but it might be audio based on the strings in the ROM. Perhaps that’s a project for later…</p>

                      <ul><li><b>New Study from BCG Reveals That When Employees Feel Included at Work, the Likelihood of Burnout Is Halved</b></li><li><b>Report Highlights Four Key Employee Sentiments That Have the Biggest Impact on Inclusion</b></li></ul><p><b>BOSTON—</b>At some point in their careers, most, if not all, employees around the world have likely experienced symptoms of burnout at work—a state of exhaustion characterized by disenchantment with one’s job and a sense of inefficiency. A new report released today by Boston Consulting Group (BCG) reveals that, on average, 48% of workers from eight countries indicate that they are currently grappling with burnout.</p><p>Based on a survey of 11,000 desk-based and frontline workers in eight countries (Australia, Canada, France, Germany, India, Japan, UK, and US) and titled <a href="https://www.bcg.com/publications/2024/four-keys-to-boosting-inclusion-and-beating-burnout" data-path="four-keys-to-boosting-inclusion-and-beating-burnout" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>Four Keys to Boosting Inclusion and Beating Burnout</i></a>, the report also reveals that when employees feel included at work, burnout is halved.</p><p>Inclusion is central to building and maintaining a successful workforce. Inclusion in the workplace means that employees feel valued, respected, supported, and like they belong. Workers experiencing higher inclusion are also more likely to stay in their jobs, decreasing turnover costs for businesses.</p><p>For this research, BCG quantified inclusion as a score of how inclusive an employee finds the workplace to be, using <a href="https://www.bcg.com/publications/2023/how-to-improve-inclusion-in-the-workplace" data-path="how-to-improve-inclusion-in-the-workplace" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BCG’s BLISS Index</a>, a statistically rigorous tool that identifies the factors that most strongly influence feelings of inclusion in the workplace.</p><p>Further, the survey revealed four sentiments that have the greatest impact on employees’ overall sense of feeling included:<br></p><ul><li>Good access to resources</li><li>Senior managerial support</li><li>Psychological safety with direct manager</li><li>Fair and equal opportunity for success</li></ul><p>These signal how much, or how little, people are experiencing inclusion in the workplace. When employees feel that these sentiments are positively addressed in their workplace, they feel <i>more</i> included and <i>less</i> burned out. Unfortunately, these most important sentiments are also the ones where survey respondents indicated the lowest levels of satisfaction.&nbsp;</p><p>And while burnout is prevalent across all employee types, it’s far higher for certain subgroups. Women, members of the LGBTQ+ community, people with disabilities, and deskless workers experienced up to 26% higher burnout. Moreover, these employee groups reported lower inclusion than employees who were in majority groups or were desk-based.</p><p>Feeling included means many different things to many different people. It follows that building inclusion can be daunting. But focusing on these four most important sentiments gives employers a clear starting point to ask workers the right questions and focus their efforts to understand the employee experience.</p><p>“Inclusion doesn’t end at recruitment. It requires listening to workers on an ongoing basis and addressing their pain points. It must address both the employee offer and the daily experience of employees with their managers,” said Gabrielle Novacek, a managing director and partner at BCG and coauthor of the report.</p><p>“By focusing on the four key areas and diagnosing where they may be falling short in their current efforts to meet their employees’ needs, companies will be able to identify where to invest and innovate to improve feelings of inclusion and reduce burnout. Establishing programs to meet these needs will help employers avoid the costs associated with burnout, be able to attract talent, and reap the benefits of a thriving workforce.”</p><p>Download the publication <a href="https://www.bcg.com/publications/2024/four-keys-to-boosting-inclusion-and-beating-burnout" data-path="four-keys-to-boosting-inclusion-and-beating-burnout" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Media Contact:</b><br>Eric Gregoire--<a href="mailto:gregoire.eric@bcg.com" data-path="mailto:gregoire" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gregoire.eric@bcg.com</a></p>
