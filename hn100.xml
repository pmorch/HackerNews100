Multiple devices can mutate data independently, sometimes offline, and later must converge to the </span><strong>exact same state</strong><span> without losing data.</span></p><p>There are two main challenges to solve:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Unreliable ordering</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Conflicts</strong></p></li></ol><p>Let’s go through them.</p><p>In a distributed environment, events happen on multiple devices at different times. If you just apply them as they arrive, you get inconsistent results.</p><p>Example:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Device A</strong><span> sets </span><code>x = 3</code></p></li><li><p><strong>Device B</strong><span> sets </span><code>x = 5</code></p></li></ul><p>Both happen while offline.</p><p><span>When the devices sync, the final value of </span><code>x</code><span> depends on which update is applied first. That’s a problem.</span></p><p><span>Traditional backend databases solve this with </span><strong>strong consistency</strong><span>, but that requires global coordination—too slow and brittle for local-first systems.</span></p><p><span>Instead, we want </span><strong>eventual consistency</strong><span>: every device applies changes independently but eventually converges to the same result once all changes are known.</span></p><p><span>The challenge is figuring out the </span><strong>correct order of events</strong><span> without relying on a centralized clock (because the network might be down).</span></p><p><span>Surprisingly, there’s a simple solution to this seemingly hard problem: </span><strong>Hybrid Logical Clocks (HLCs)</strong><span>.</span></p><p>HLCs generate timestamps that are:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Comparable</strong><span> (can be sorted lexicographically)</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Causally consistent</strong><span> (encode the order in which events happened)</span></p></li></ul><p>HLCs combine two pieces of information:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Physical time</strong><span> (from the machine clock)</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Logical time</strong><span> (a counter that increments when clocks are out of sync or events happen too close together)</span></p></li></ul><p>In plain terms, HLCs let devices agree on “what happened first” without perfectly synchronized clocks.</p><p>Imagine two machines, A and B:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Machine A</strong><span> records an event at </span><code>10:00:00.100</code><span>.</span><br><span>→ Its HLC becomes </span><code>(10:00:00.100, 0)</code><span> (time + counter).</span></p></li><li><p>A sends a message to B with this HLC.</p></li><li><p><strong>Machine B</strong><span>’s clock shows </span><code>10:00:00.095</code><span> (slightly behind).</span><br><span>When B receives the message, it </span><strong>advances its HLC</strong><span> to at least match A’s timestamp.</span></p></li><li><p><span>B’s HLC becomes </span><code>(10:00:00.100, 1)</code><span> — the counter increments to indicate this happened </span><em>after</em><span> A’s event.</span></p></li></ol><p>Result:</p><ul><li><p><span>Event on A: </span><code>(10:00:00.100, 0)</code></p></li><li><p><span>Event on B: </span><code>(10:00:00.100, 1)</code></p></li></ul><p>Even though B’s physical clock was behind, we can now order events consistently across machines.</p><p><span>Even with proper ordering, </span><strong>conflicts still happen</strong><span> when two devices modify the same data independently.</span></p><p>Example:</p><ul><li><p><span>Initial balance = </span><code>100</code></p></li><li><p><strong>Device A:</strong><span> </span><code>+20</code><span> → balance = </span><code>120</code></p></li><li><p><strong>Device B:</strong><span> </span><code>-20</code><span> → balance = </span><code>80</code></p></li></ul><p><span>When they sync, which value should “win”?</span><br><span>If you naively apply both updates, one overwrites the other—losing user data.</span></p><p>Most systems ask developers to write manual conflict resolution code, but that’s error-prone and hard to maintain.</p><p><span>The right approach is </span><strong>CRDTs</strong><span> (Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types).</span></p><p>CRDTs guarantee two important properties:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Commutativity:</strong><span> Order of application doesn’t matter</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Idempotence:</strong><span> Applying the same change twice has no effect</span></p></li></ul><p>This means you can apply messages in any order, even multiple times, and every device will still converge to the same state.</p><p><span>One of the simplest CRDT strategies is </span><strong>Last-Write-Wins (LWW)</strong><span>:</span></p><ul><li><p>Each update gets a timestamp (physical or logical).</p></li><li><p>When two devices write to the same field, the update with the latest timestamp wins.</p></li></ul><p>Example:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Device A:</strong><span> balance = </span><code>120</code><span> at </span><code>10:00:00</code></p></li><li><p><strong>Device B:</strong><span> balance = </span><code>80</code><span> at </span><code>10:00:02</code></p></li></ul><p><span>When syncing, the system keeps </span><code>80</code><span> because it was written last.</span></p><p><span>When building a local-first app, you need a rock-solid local database. </span><strong>SQLite</strong><span> is the obvious choice: battle-tested, lightweight, and available everywhere.</span></p><p><span>That’s why we built our local-first framework as a </span><strong>SQLite extension</strong><span>.</span></p><p>Our approach (simplified):</p><ul><li><p><span>Every change is stored as a message in a </span><code>messages</code><span> table with:</span></p><ul><li><p><code>timestamp</code><span> (from HLC)</span></p></li><li><p><code>dataset</code><span> (table name)</span></p></li><li><p><code>row</code><span> (encoded primary keys)</span></p></li><li><p><code>column</code></p></li><li><p><code>value</code></p></li></ul></li></ul><p>Applying a message is as simple as:</p><ol><li><p>Look up the current value</p></li><li><p>If the incoming timestamp is newer → overwrite</p></li><li><p>If it’s older → ignore</p></li></ol><p>This guarantees convergence across devices, regardless of the sync order.</p><p><span>This architecture makes syncing </span><strong>simple and reliable</strong><span>:</span></p><ul><li><p><strong>Reliable:</strong><span> Survives weeks of offline use without data loss</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Deterministic:</strong><span> Final state always converges</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Minimal:</strong><span> Just a small SQLite extension, no heavy dependencies</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Cross-platform:</strong><span> The extension is available for iOS, Android, macOS, Windows, Linux, and WASM</span></p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Stop faking offline support with request queues</p></li><li><p><span>Embrace </span><strong>eventual consistency</strong></p></li><li><p><span>Use proven distributed-systems techniques like </span><strong>HLCs</strong><span> and </span><strong>CRDTs</strong></p></li><li><p>Keep it small and dependency-free</p></li></ul><p><span>The result? Apps that are </span><strong>instant</strong><span>, </span><strong>offline-capable</strong><span>, and </span><strong>private by default</strong><span> — without the complexity of traditional client–server synchronization.</span></p><p><span>If you need a production-ready, cross-platform, offline-first engine for SQLite, check out our open-source </span><strong><a href="https://github.com/sqliteai/sqlite-sync" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">SQLite-Sync </a></strong><span>extension.</span></p></div></article></div><div id="discussion"><h4>Discussion about this post</h4></div></div>]]></description>

Sometimes that means we tackle immense, Internet-scale problems with established partners. And sometimes that means we support and partner with fantastic open teams taking big bets on the next generation of tools.</p><p>To that end, today we are excited to announce our support of two independent, open source projects: <a href="https://ladybird.org/"><u>Ladybird</u></a>, an ambitious project to build a completely independent browser from the ground up, and <a href="https://omarchy.org/"><u>Omarchy</u></a>, an opinionated Arch Linux setup for developers.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
      <h2 id="two-open-source-projects-strengthening-the-open-internet">Two open source projects strengthening the open Internet&nbsp;</h2>
      
    </p>
    <p>Cloudflare has a long history of supporting open-source software – both through <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/open-source/"><u>our own projects shared with the community</u></a> and <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/sponsorships/"><u>external</u></a> projects that we support. We see our sponsorship of Ladybird and Omarchy as a natural extension of these efforts in a moment where energy for a diverse ecosystem is needed more than ever.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
      <h3 id="ladybird-a-new-and-independent-browser">Ladybird, a new and independent browser&nbsp;</h3>
      
    </p>
    <p>Most of us spend a significant amount of time using a web browser –&nbsp; in fact, you’re probably using one to read this blog! The beauty of browsers is that they help users experience the open Internet, giving you access to everything from the largest news publications in the world to a tiny website hosted on a Raspberry Pi.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Unlike dedicated apps, browsers reduce the barriers to building an audience for new services and communities on the Internet. If you are launching something new, you can offer it through a browser in a world where most people have absolutely zero desire to install an app just to try something out. Browsers help encourage competition and new ideas on the open web.</p><p>While the openness of how browsers work has led to an explosive growth of services on the Internet, browsers themselves have consolidated to a tiny handful of viable options. There’s a high probability you’re reading this on a Chromium-based browser, like Google’s Chrome, along with about <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/reports/browser-market-share-2025-q2"><u>65% of users on the Internet.</u></a> However, that consolidation has also scared off new entrants in the space. If all browsers ship on the same operating systems, powered by the same underlying technology, we lose out on potential privacy, security and performance innovations that could benefit developers and everyday Internet users.&nbsp;</p>

          </figure><p><sup><i>A screenshot of Cloudflare Workers developer docs in Ladybird&nbsp;</i></sup></p><p>This is where Ladybird comes in: it’s not Chromium based – everything is built from scratch. The Ladybird project has two main components: LibWeb, a brand-new rendering engine, and LibJS, a brand-new JavaScript engine with its own parser, interpreter, and bytecode execution engine.&nbsp;</p><p>Building an engine that can correctly and securely render the modern web is a monumental task that requires deep technical expertise and navigating decades of specifications governed by standards bodies like the W3C and WHATWG. And because Ladybird implements these standards directly, it also stress-tests them in practice. Along the way, the project has found, reported, and sometimes fixed countless issues in the specifications themselves, contributions that strengthen the entire web platform for developers, browser vendors, and anyone who may attempt to build a browser in the future.</p><p>Whether to build something from scratch or not is a perennial source of debate between software engineers, but absent the pressures of revenue or special interests, we’re excited about the ways Ladybird will prioritize privacy, performance, and security, potentially in novel ways that will influence the entire ecosystem.</p>

    </p>
    <p>Developers deserve choice, too. Beyond the browser, a developer’s operating system and environment is where they spend a ton of time – and where a few big players have become the dominant choice. Omarchy challenges this by providing a complete, opinionated Arch Linux distribution that transforms a bare installation into a modern development workstation that developers are <a href="https://github.com/basecamp/omarchy"><u>excited about</u></a>.</p><p>Perfecting one’s development environment can be a career-long art, but learning how to do so shouldn’t be a barrier to beginning to code. The beauty of Omarchy is that it makes Linux approachable to more developers by doing most of the setup for them, making it look good, and then making it configurable. Omarchy provides most of the tools developers need – like Neovim, Docker, and Git – out of the box, and <a href="https://learn.omacom.io/2/the-omarchy-manual"><u>tons of other features</u></a>.</p><p>At its core, Omarchy embraces Linux for all of its complexity and configurability, and makes a version of it that is accessible and fun to use for developers that don’t have a deep background in operating systems. Projects like this ensure that a powerful, independent Linux desktop remains a compelling choice for people building the next generation of applications and Internet infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>

      <h3 id="our-support-comes-with-no-strings-attached">Our support comes with no strings attached&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
      
    </p>
    <p>We want to be very clear here: we are supporting these projects because we believe the Internet can be better if these projects, and more like them, succeed. No requirement to use our technology stack or any arrangement like that. We are happy to partner with great teams like Ladybird and Omarchy simply because we believe that our missions have real overlap.</p>

    </p>
    <p>Ladybird is still in its early days, with an alpha release planned for 2026, but we encourage anyone who is interested to consider contributing to the <a href="https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/tree/master"><u>open source codebase</u></a> as they prepare for launch.</p><blockquote><p><i>"Cloudflare knows what it means to build critical web infrastructure on the server side. With Ladybird, we’re tackling the near-monoculture on the client side, because we believe it needs multiple implementations to stay healthy, and we’re extremely thankful for their support in that mission.”</i></p><p>– <b>Andreas Kling</b>, Founder, Ladybird&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p><a href="https://github.com/basecamp/omarchy/releases/tag/v3.0.0"><u>Omarchy 3.0</u></a> was released just last week with faster installation and increased Macbook compatibility, so if you’ve been Linux-curious for a while now, we encourage you to try it out!</p><blockquote><p><i>"Cloudflare's support of Omarchy has ensured we have the fastest ISO and package delivery from wherever you are in the world. Without a need to manually configure mirrors or deal with torrents. The combo of a super CDN, great R2 storage, and the best DDoS shield in the business has been a huge help for the project."</i></p><p>– <b>David Heinemeier Hansson</b>, Creator of Omarchy and Ruby on Rails</p></blockquote><p>A better Internet is one where people have more choice in how they browse and develop new software. We’re incredibly excited about the potential of Ladybird, Omarchy, and other audacious projects that support a free and open Internet. </p></div></section><div><p>Cloudflare's connectivity cloud protects <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cloudflare.com/network-services/" rel="noreferrer">entire corporate networks</a>, helps customers build <a target="_blank" href="https://workers.cloudflare.com/" rel="noreferrer">Internet-scale applications efficiently</a>, accelerates any <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cloudflare.com/performance/accelerate-internet-applications/" rel="noreferrer">website or Internet application</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cloudflare.com/ddos/" rel="noreferrer">wards off DDoS attacks</a>, keeps <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cloudflare.com/application-security/" rel="noreferrer">hackers at bay</a>, and can help you on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/" rel="noreferrer">your journey to Zero Trust</a>.</p><p>Visit <a target="_blank" href="https://one.one.one.one/" rel="noreferrer">1.1.1.1</a> from any device to get started with our free app that makes your Internet faster and safer.</p><p>To learn more about our mission to help build a better Internet, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/what-is-cloudflare/" rel="noreferrer">start here</a>.

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>This small ebook is here to teach you a programming language called Forth. Forth is a
language unlike most others. It’s not functional <em>or</em> object oriented, it doesn’t
have type-checking, and it basically has zero syntax. It was written in the 70s, but
is still used today for
<a href="http://www.forth.com/resources/apps/more-applications.html">certain applications</a>.</p>

<p>Why would you want to learn such an odd language? Every new programming
language you learn helps you think about problems in new ways. Forth is very
easy to learn, but it requires you to think in a different way than you’re used
to. That makes it a perfect language to broaden your coding horizons.</p>

<p>This book includes a simple implementation of Forth I wrote in JavaScript. It’s by
no means perfect, and is missing a lot of the functionality you’d expect in a real
Forth system. It’s just here to give you an easy way to try out the examples. (If
you’re a Forth expert, please
<a href="https://github.com/skilldrick/easyforth">contribute here</a> and make it better!)</p>

<p>I’m going to assume that you know at least one other programming language, and have
a basic idea of how stacks work as a data structure.</p>

<h2 id="adding-some-numbers">Adding Some Numbers</h2>

<p>The thing that separates Forth from most other languages is its use of the
stack. In Forth, everything revolves around the stack. Any time you type a
number, it gets pushed onto the stack. If you want to add two numbers together,
typing <code>+</code> takes the top two numbers off the stack, adds them, and puts
the result back on the stack.</p>

<p>Let’s take a look at an example. Type (don’t copy-paste) the following into the
interpreter, typing <code>Enter</code> after each line.</p>





<p>Every time you type a line followed by the <code>Enter</code> key, the Forth interpreter
executes that line, and appends the string <code>ok</code> to let you know there were no
errors. You should also notice that as you execute each line, the area at the
top fills up with numbers. That area is our visualization of the stack. It
should look like this:</p>

<p>1 2 3 &lt;- Top</p>

<p>Now, into the same interpreter, type a single <code>+</code> followed by the <code>Enter</code> key. The top two
elements on the stack, <code>2</code> and <code>3</code>, have been replaced by <code>5</code>.</p>

<p>1 5 &lt;- Top</p>

<p>At this point, your editor window should look like this:</p>

<p>1  <span>ok</span>
2  <span>ok</span>
3  <span>ok</span>
+  <span>ok</span>
</p>

<p>Type <code>+</code> again and press <code>Enter</code>, and the top two elements will be replaced by 6. If
you type <code>+</code> one more time, Forth will try to pop the top two elements off the
stack, even though there’s only <em>one</em> element on the stack! This results in a
<code>Stack underflow</code> error:</p>

<p>1  <span>ok</span>
2  <span>ok</span>
3  <span>ok</span>
+  <span>ok</span>
+  <span>ok</span>
+  <span>Stack underflow</span>
</p>

<p>Forth doesn’t force you to type every token as a separate line. Type the
following into the next editor, followed by the <code>Enter</code> key:</p>





<p>The stack should now look like this:</p>

<p>579 &lt;- Top</p>

<p>This style, where the operator appears after the operands, is known as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation">Reverse-Polish
notation</a>. Let’s try
something a bit more complicated, and calculate <code>10 * (5 + 2)</code>. Type the
following into the interpreter:</p>





<p>One of the nice things about Forth is that the order of operations is
completely based on their order in the program. For example, when executing <code>5
2 + 10 *</code>, the interpreter pushes 5 to the stack, then 2, then adds them and
pushes the resulting 7, then pushes 10 to the stack, then multiplies 7 and 10.
Because of this, there’s no need for parentheses to group operators with lower
precedence.</p>

<h3 id="stack-effects">Stack Effects</h3>

<p>Most Forth words affect the stack in some way. Some take values off the stack,
some leave new values on the stack, and some do a mixture of both. These “stack
effects” are commonly represented using comments of the form <code>( before -- after
)</code>. For example, <code>+</code> is <code>( n1 n2 -- sum )</code> - <code>n1</code> and <code>n2</code> are the top two numbers
on the stack, and <code>sum</code> is the value left on the stack.</p>

<h2 id="defining-words">Defining Words</h2>

<p>The syntax of Forth is extremely straightforward. Forth code is interpreted as
a series of space-delimited words. Almost all non-whitespace characters are valid
in words. When the Forth interpreter reads a word, it checks to see if a
definition exists in an internal structure known as the Dictionary. If it is
found, that definition is executed. Otherwise, the word is assumed to be a
number, and it is pushed onto the stack. If the word cannot be converted to a
number, an error occurs.</p>

<p>You can try that out yourself below. Type <code>foo</code> (an unrecognized word)
and press enter.</p>



<p>You should see something like this:</p>

<p>foo  <span>foo ?</span></p>

<p><code>foo ?</code> means that Forth was unable to find a definition for <code>foo</code>, and it
wasn’t a valid number.</p>

<p>We can create our own definition of <code>foo</code> using two special words called <code>:</code>
(colon) and <code>;</code> (semicolon).  <code>:</code> is our way of telling Forth we want to create
a definition. The first word after the <code>:</code> becomes the definition name, and the
rest of the words (until the <code>;</code>) make up the body of the definition. It’s
conventional to include two spaces between the name and the body of the
definition. Try entering the following:</p>

<div><pre><code>: foo  100 + ;
1000 foo
foo foo foo
</code></pre></div>

<p><strong>Warning:</strong> A common mistake is to miss out the space before the <code>;</code> word. Because Forth
words are space delimited and can contain most characters, <code>+;</code> is a perfectly
valid word and is not parsed as two separate words.</p>



<p>As you’ve hopefully figured out, our <code>foo</code> word simply adds 100 to the value on
top of the stack. It’s not very interesting, but it should give you an idea of
how simple definitions work.</p>

<h2 id="stack-manipulation">Stack Manipulation</h2>

<p>Now we can start taking a look at some of Forth’s predefined words. First,
let’s look at some words for manipulating the elements at the top of the stack.</p>

<h3 id="dup--n----n-n-"><code>dup ( n -- n n )</code></h3>

<p><code>dup</code> is short for “duplicate” – it duplicates the top element of the stack. For example,
try this out:</p>





<p>You should end up with the following stack:</p>

<p>1 2 3 3 &lt;- Top</p>

<h3 id="drop--n----"><code>drop ( n -- )</code></h3>

<p><code>drop</code> simply drops the top element of the stack. Running:</p>



<p>gives you a stack of:</p>

<p>1 2 &lt;- Top</p>



<h3 id="swap--n1-n2----n2-n1-"><code>swap ( n1 n2 -- n2 n1 )</code></h3>

<p><code>swap</code>, as you may have guessed, swaps the top two elements of the stack. For example:</p>



<p>will give you:</p>

<p>1 2 4 3 &lt;- Top</p>



<h3 id="over--n1-n2----n1-n2-n1-"><code>over ( n1 n2 -- n1 n2 n1 )</code></h3>

<p><code>over</code> is a bit less obvious: it takes the second element from the top of the
stack and duplicates it to the top of the stack. Running this:</p>



<p>will result in this:</p>

<p>1 2 3 2 &lt;- Top</p>



<h3 id="rot--n1-n2-n3----n2-n3-n1-"><code>rot ( n1 n2 n3 -- n2 n3 n1 )</code></h3>

<p>Finally, <code>rot</code> “rotates” the top <em>three</em> elements of the stack. The third
element from the top of the stack gets moved to the top of the stack, pushing
the other two elements down.</p>



<p>gives you:</p>

<p>2 3 1 &lt;- Top</p>



<h2 id="generating-output">Generating Output</h2>

<p>Next, let’s look at some words for outputting text to the console.</p>

<h3 id="--n-----period"><code>. ( n -- )</code> (period)</h3>

<p>The simplest output word in Forth is <code>.</code>. You can use <code>.</code> to output the top of
the stack in the output of the current line. For example, try running this
(make sure to include all the spaces!):</p>





<p>You should see this:</p>

<p>1 . 2 . 3 . 4 5 6 . . . <span>1 2 3 6 5 4  ok</span></p>

<p>Going through this in order, we push <code>1</code>, then pop it off and output it. Then
we do the same with <code>2</code> and <code>3</code>. Next we push <code>4</code>, <code>5</code>, and <code>6</code> onto the stack.
We then pop them off and output them one-by-one. That’s why the last three
numbers in the output are reversed: the stack is last in, first out.</p>

<h3 id="emit--c----"><code>emit ( c -- )</code></h3>

<p><code>emit</code> can be used to output numbers as ascii characters. Just like <code>.</code> outputs
the number at the top of the stack, <code>emit</code> outputs that number as an ascii
character. For example:</p>

<div><pre><code> 33 119 111 87 emit emit emit emit
</code></pre></div>



<p>I won’t give the output here so as to not ruin the surprise. This could also be
written as:</p>

<div><pre><code>87 emit 111 emit 119 emit 33 emit
</code></pre></div>

<p>Unlike <code>.</code>, <code>emit</code> doesn’t output any space after each character, enabling you
to build up arbitrary strings of output.</p>

<h3 id="cr-----"><code>cr ( -- )</code></h3>

<p><code>cr</code> is short for carriage return – it simply outputs a newline:</p>

<div><pre><code>cr 100 . cr 200 . cr 300 .
</code></pre></div>



<p>This will output:</p>

<p>cr 100 . cr 200 . cr 300 .<span>
100
200
300  ok</span></p>

<h3 id="-----"><code>." ( -- )</code></h3>

<p>Finally we have <code>."</code> – a special word for outputting strings. The <code>."</code> word works
differently inside definitions to interactive mode. <code>."</code> marks the beginning of
a string to output, and the end of the string is marked by <code>"</code>. The closing <code>"</code>
isn’t a word, and so doesn’t need to be space-delimited. Here’s an example:</p>

<div><pre><code>: say-hello  ." Hello there!" ;
say-hello
</code></pre></div>



<p>You should see the following output</p>

<p>say-hello <span>Hello there! ok</span></p>

<p>We can combine <code>."</code>, <code>.</code>, <code>cr</code>, and <code>emit</code> to build up more complex output:</p>

<div><pre><code>: print-stack-top  cr dup ." The top of the stack is " .
  cr ." which looks like '" dup emit ." ' in ascii  " ;
48 print-stack-top
</code></pre></div>



<p>Running this should give you the following output:</p>

<p>48 print-stack-top <span>
The top of the stack is 48
which looks like '0' in ascii   ok</span></p>

<h2 id="conditionals-and-loops">Conditionals and Loops</h2>

<p>Now onto the fun stuff! Forth, like most other languages, has conditionals and
loops for controlling the flow of your program. To understand how they work,
however, first we need to understand booleans in Forth.</p>

<h3 id="booleans">Booleans</h3>

<p>There’s actually no boolean type in Forth. The number <code>0</code> is treated as false,
and any other number is true, although the canonical true value is <code>-1</code> (all
boolean operators return <code>0</code> or <code>-1</code>).</p>

<p>To test if two numbers are equal, you can use <code>=</code>:</p>



<p>This should output:</p>

<p>3 4 = . <span>0  ok</span>
5 5 = . <span>-1  ok</span></p>



<p>You can use <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> for less than and greater than. <code>&lt;</code> checks to see if the
second item from the top of the stack is less than the top item of the stack, and
vice versa for <code>&gt;</code>:</p>



<p>3 4 &lt; . <span>-1  ok</span>
3 4 &gt; . <span>0  ok</span></p>



<p>The boolean operators And, Or, and Not are available as <code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, and <code>invert</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code>3 4 &lt; 20 30 &lt; and .
3 4 &lt; 20 30 &gt; or .
3 4 &lt; invert .
</code></pre></div>

<p>The first line is the equivalent of <code>3 &lt; 4 &amp; 20 &lt; 30</code> in a C-based language.
The second line is the equivalent of <code>3 &lt; 4 | 20 &gt; 30</code>. The third line is the
equivalent of <code>!(3 &lt; 4)</code>.</p>

<p><code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, and <code>invert</code> are all bitwise operations. For well-formed flags
(<code>0</code> and <code>-1</code>) they’ll work as expected, but they’ll give incorrect results for
arbitrary numbers.</p>



<h3 id="if-then"><code>if then</code></h3>

<p>Now we can finally get onto conditionals. Conditionals in Forth can only be
used inside definitions. The simplest conditional statement in Forth is <code>if
then</code>, which is equivalent to a standard <code>if</code> statement in most languages.
Here’s an example of a definition using <code>if then</code>. In this example, we’re also
using the <code>mod</code> word, which returns the modulo of the top two numbers on the
stack. In this case, the top number is 5, and the other is whatever was placed
on the stack before calling <code>buzz?</code>. Therefore, <code>5 mod 0 =</code> is a boolean
expression that checks to see if the top of the stack is divisible by 5.</p>

<div><pre><code>: buzz?  5 mod 0 = if ." Buzz" then ;
3 buzz?
4 buzz?
5 buzz?
</code></pre></div>



<p>This will output:</p>

<p>3 buzz?<span>  ok</span>
4 buzz?<span>  ok</span>
5 buzz?<span> Buzz ok</span></p>

<p>It’s important to note that the <code>then</code> word marks the end of the <code>if</code> statement.
This makes it equivalent to <code>fi</code> in Bash or <code>end</code> in Ruby, for example.</p>

<p>Another important thing to realize is that <code>if</code> consumes the top value on the
stack when it checks to see if it’s true or false.</p>

<h3 id="if-else-then"><code>if else then</code></h3>

<p><code>if else then</code> is equivalent to an <code>if/else</code> statement in most languages. Here’s
an example of its use:</p>

<div><pre><code>: is-it-zero?  0 = if ." Yes!" else ." No!" then ;
0 is-it-zero?
1 is-it-zero?
2 is-it-zero?
</code></pre></div>



<p>This outputs:</p>

<p>0 is-it-zero?<span> Yes! ok</span>
1 is-it-zero?<span> No! ok</span>
2 is-it-zero?<span> No! ok</span></p>

<p>This time, the if clause (consequent) is everything between <code>if</code> and <code>else</code>,
and the else clause (alternative) is everything between <code>else</code> and <code>then</code>.</p>

<h3 id="do-loop"><code>do loop</code></h3>

<p><code>do loop</code> in Forth most closely resembles a <code>for</code> loop in most C-based languages.
In the body of a <code>do loop</code>, the special word <code>i</code> pushes the current loop index
onto the stack.</p>

<p>The top two values on the stack give the starting value (inclusive) and ending
value (exclusive) for the <code>i</code> value. The starting value is taken from the top
of the stack. Here’s an example:</p>

<div><pre><code>: loop-test  10 0 do i . loop ;
loop-test
</code></pre></div>



<p>This should output:</p>

<p>loop-test<span> 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9  ok</span></p>

<p>The expression <code>10 0 do i . loop</code> is roughly equivalent to:</p>

<div><pre><code>for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {
  print(i);
}
</code></pre></div>

<h3 id="fizz-buzz">Fizz Buzz</h3>

<p>We can write the classic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz">Fizz Buzz</a>
program easily using a <code>do loop</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code>: fizz?  3 mod 0 = dup if ." Fizz" then ;
: buzz?  5 mod 0 = dup if ." Buzz" then ;
: fizz-buzz?  dup fizz? swap buzz? or invert ;
: do-fizz-buzz  25 1 do cr i fizz-buzz? if i . then loop ;
do-fizz-buzz
</code></pre></div>



<p><code>fizz?</code> checks to see if the top of the stack is divisible by 3 using <code>3 mod 0
=</code>. It then uses <code>dup</code> to duplicate this result. The top copy of the value is
consumed by <code>if</code>.  The second copy is left on the stack and acts as the return
value of <code>fizz?</code>.</p>

<p>If the number on top of the stack is divisible by 3, the string <code>"Fizz"</code> will
be output, otherwise there will be no output.</p>

<p><code>buzz?</code> does the same thing but with 5, and outputs the string <code>"Buzz"</code>.</p>

<p><code>fizz-buzz?</code> calls <code>dup</code> to duplicate the value on top of the stack, then calls
<code>fizz?</code>, converting the top copy into a boolean. After this, the top of the
stack consists of the original value, and the boolean returned by <code>fizz?</code>.
<code>swap</code> swaps these, so the original top-of-stack value is back on top, and the
boolean is underneath. Next we call <code>buzz?</code>, which replaces the top-of-stack
value with a boolean flag. Now the top two values on the stack are booleans
representing whether the number was divisible by 3 or 5.  After this, we call
<code>or</code> to see if either of these is true, and <code>invert</code> to negate this value.
Logically, the body of <code>fizz-buzz?</code> is equivalent to:</p>

<div><pre><code>!(x % 3 == 0 || x % 5 == 0)
</code></pre></div>

<p>Therefore, <code>fizz-buzz?</code> returns a boolean indicating if the argument is not
divisible by 3 or 5, and thus should be printed.  Finally, <code>do-fizz-buzz</code> loops
from 1 to 25, calling <code>fizz-buzz?</code> on <code>i</code>, and outputting <code>i</code> if <code>fizz-buzz?</code>
returns true.</p>

<p>If you’re having trouble figuring out what’s going on inside <code>fizz-buzz?</code>, the
example below might help you to understand how it works. All we’re doing here
is executing each word of the definition of <code>fizz-buzz?</code> on a separate line. As
you execute each line, watch the stack to see how it changes:</p>

<div><pre><code>: fizz?  3 mod 0 = dup if ." Fizz" then ;
: buzz?  5 mod 0 = dup if ." Buzz" then ;
4
dup
fizz?
swap
buzz?
or
invert
</code></pre></div>



<p>Here’s how each line affects the stack:</p>

<div><pre><code>4         4 &lt;- Top
dup       4 4 &lt;- Top
fizz?     4 0 &lt;- Top
swap      0 4 &lt;- Top
buzz?     0 0 &lt;- Top
or        0 &lt;- Top
invert    -1 &lt;- Top
</code></pre></div>

<p>Remember, the final value on the stack is the return value of the <code>fizz-buzz?</code>
word. In this case, it’s true, because the number was not divisible by 3 or 5,
and so <em>should</em> be printed.</p>

<p>Here’s the same thing but starting with 5:</p>

<div><pre><code>5         5 &lt;- Top
dup       5 5 &lt;- Top
fizz?     5 0 &lt;- Top
swap      0 5 &lt;- Top
buzz?     0 -1 &lt;- Top
or        -1 &lt;- Top
invert    0 &lt;- Top
</code></pre></div>

<p>In this case the original top-of-stack value was divisible by 5, so nothing
should be printed.</p>

<h2 id="variables-and-constants">Variables and Constants</h2>

<p>Forth also allows you to save values in variables and constants. Variables allow
you to keep track of changing values without having to store them on the stack.
Constants give you a simple way to refer to a value that won’t change.</p>

<h3 id="variables">Variables</h3>

<p>Because the role of local variables is generally played by the stack, variables
in Forth are used more to store state that may be needed across multiple
words.</p>

<p>Defining variables is simple:</p>



<p>This basically associates a particular memory location with the name <code>balance</code>.
<code>balance</code> is now a word, and all it does is to push its memory location onto the
stack:</p>





<p>You should see the value <code>1000</code> on the stack. This Forth implementation arbitrarily
starts storing variables at the memory location <code>1000</code>.</p>

<p>The word <code>!</code> stores a value at the memory location referenced by a variable, and the
word <code>@</code> fetches the value from a memory location:</p>

<div><pre><code>variable balance
123 balance !
balance @
</code></pre></div>



<p>This time you should see the value <code>123</code> on the stack. <code>123 balance</code> pushes the
value and the memory location onto the stack, and <code>!</code> stores that value at that
memory location. Likewise, <code>@</code> retrieves the value based on the memory location,
and pushes that value onto the stack. If you’ve used C or C++, you can think of
<code>balance</code> as a pointer that is dereferenced by <code>@</code>.</p>

<p>The word <code>?</code> is defined as <code>@ .</code> and it prints the current value of a variable.
The word <code>+!</code> is used to increase the value of a variable by a certain amount
(like <code>+=</code> in C-based languages).</p>

<div><pre><code>variable balance
123 balance !
balance ?
50 balance +!
balance ?
</code></pre></div>



<p>Run this code and you should see:</p>

<p>variable balance<span>  ok</span>
123 balance ! <span> ok</span>
balance ? <span>123  ok</span>
50 balance +! <span> ok</span>
balance ? <span>173  ok</span>
</p>

<h3 id="constants">Constants</h3>

<p>If you have a value that doesn’t change, you can store it as a constant. Constants
are defined in one line, like this:</p>



<p>This creates a new constant called <code>answer</code> with the value <code>42</code>. Unlike variables,
constants just represent values, rather than memory locations, so there’s no need
to use <code>@</code>.</p>

<div><pre><code>42 constant answer
2 answer *
</code></pre></div>



<p>Running this will push the value <code>84</code> on the stack. <code>answer</code> is treated as if it
was the number it represents (just like constants and variables in other languages).</p>

<h2 id="arrays">Arrays</h2>

<p>Forth doesn’t exactly support arrays, but it does allow you to allocate a zone of
contiguous memory, a lot like arrays in C. To allocate this memory, use the <code>allot</code>
word.</p>

<div><pre><code>variable numbers
3 cells allot
10 numbers 0 cells + !
20 numbers 1 cells + !
30 numbers 2 cells + !
40 numbers 3 cells + !
</code></pre></div>



<p>This example creates a memory location called <code>numbers</code>, and reserves three extra
memory cells after this location, giving a total of four memory cells. (<code>cells</code>
just multiplies by the cell-width, which is 1 in this implementation.)</p>

<p><code>numbers 0 +</code> gives the address of the first cell in the array. <code>10 numbers 0 + !</code>
stores the value <code>10</code> in the first cell of the array.</p>

<p>We can easily write words to simplify array access:</p>

<div><pre><code>variable numbers
3 cells allot
: number  ( offset -- addr )  cells numbers + ;

10 0 number !
20 1 number !
30 2 number !
40 3 number !

2 number ?
</code></pre></div>



<p><code>number</code> takes an offset into <code>numbers</code> and returns the memory address at that
offset. <code>30 2 number !</code> stores <code>30</code> at offset <code>2</code> in <code>numbers</code>, and <code>2 number ?</code>
prints the value at offset <code>2</code> in <code>numbers</code>.</p>

<h2 id="keyboard-input">Keyboard Input</h2>

<p>Forth has a special word called <code>key</code>, which is used for accepting keyboard input.
When the <code>key</code> word is executed, execution is paused until a key is pressed. Once
a key is pressed, the key code of that key is pushed onto the stack. Try out the
following:</p>





<p>When you run this line, you’ll notice that at first nothing happens. This is because
the interpreter is waiting for your keyboard input. Try hitting the <code>A</code> key, and
you should see the keycode for that key, <code>65</code>, appear as output on the current line.
Now hit <code>B</code>, then <code>C</code>, and you should see the following:</p>

<p>key . key . key . <span>65 66 67  ok</span></p>

<h3 id="printing-keys-with-begin-until">Printing keys with <code>begin until</code></h3>

<p>Forth has another kind of loop called <code>begin until</code>. This works like a <code>while</code>
loop in C-based languages. Every time the word <code>until</code> is hit, the interpreter
checks to see if the top of the stack is non-zero (true). If it is, it jumps
back to the matching <code>begin</code>. If not, execution continues.</p>

<p>Here’s an example of using <code>begin until</code> to print key codes:</p>

<div><pre><code>: print-keycode  begin key dup . 32 = until ;
print-keycode
</code></pre></div>



<p>This will keep printing key codes until you press space. You should see something like this:</p>

<p>print-keycode <span>80 82 73 78 84 189 75 69 89 67 79 68 69 32  ok</span></p>

<p><code>key</code> waits for key input, then <code>dup</code> duplicates the keycode from <code>key</code>. We
then use <code>.</code> to output the top copy of the keycode, and <code>32 =</code> to check to see
if the keycode is equal to 32. If it is, we break out of the loop, otherwise we
loop back to <code>begin</code>.</p>

<h2 id="snake">Snake!</h2>

<p>Now it’s time to put it all together and make a game! Rather than having you type
all the code, I’ve pre-loaded it into the editor.</p>

<p>Before we look at the code, try playing the game. To start the game, execute the
word <code>start</code>. Then use the arrow keys to move the snake. If you lose, you can run
<code>start</code> again.</p>



<p>Before we delve too deeply into this code, two disclaimers. First, this is terrible
Forth code. I’m by no means a Forth expert, so there’s probably all kinds of things
I’m doing in completely the wrong way. Second, this game uses a few non-standard
techniques in order to interface with JavaScript. I’ll go through these now.</p>

<h3 id="non-standard-additions">Non-Standard Additions</h3>

<h4 id="the-canvas">The Canvas</h4>

<p>You may have noticed that this editor is different from the others: it has an HTML5
Canvas element built in. I’ve created a very simple memory-mapped interface for
drawing onto this canvas. The canvas is split up into 24 x 24 “pixels” which can
be black or white. The first pixel is found at the memory address given by the
variable <code>graphics</code>, and the rest of the pixels are offsets from the variable. So,
for example, to draw a white pixel in the top-left corner you could run</p>





<p>The game uses the following words to draw to the canvas:</p>

<div><pre><code>: convert-x-y ( x y -- offset )  24 cells * + ;
: draw ( color x y -- )  convert-x-y graphics + ! ;
: draw-white ( x y -- )  1 rot rot draw ;
: draw-black ( x y -- )  0 rot rot draw ;
</code></pre></div>

<p>For example, <code>3 4 draw-white</code> draws a white pixel at the coordinates (3, 4). The
y coordinate is multiplied by 24 to get the row, then the x coordinated is added
to get the column.</p>

<h4 id="non-blocking-keyboard-input">Non-Blocking Keyboard Input</h4>

<p>The Forth word <code>key</code> blocks, so is unsuitable for a game like this. I’ve added
a variable called <code>last-key</code> which always holds the value of the last key to be
pressed. <code>last-key</code> is only updated while the interpreter is running Forth code.</p>

<h4 id="random-number-generation">Random Number Generation</h4>

<p>The Forth standard doesn’t define a way of generating random numbers, so I’ve
added a word called <code>random ( range -- n )</code> that takes a range and returns a
random number from 0 to range - 1. For example, <code>3 random</code> could
return <code>0</code>, <code>1</code>, or <code>2</code>.</p>

<h4 id="sleep--ms----"><code>sleep ( ms -- )</code></h4>

<p>Finally, I’ve added a blocking <code>sleep</code> word that pauses execution for the
number of milliseconds given.</p>

<h3 id="the-game-code">The Game Code</h3>

<p>Now we can work through the code from start to finish.</p>

<h4 id="variables-and-constants-1">Variables and Constants</h4>

<p>The start of the code just sets up some variables and constants:</p>

<div><pre><code>variable snake-x-head
500 cells allot

variable snake-y-head
500 cells allot

variable apple-x
variable apple-y

0 constant left
1 constant up
2 constant right
3 constant down

24 constant width
24 constant height

variable direction
variable length
</code></pre></div>

<p><code>snake-x-head</code> and <code>snake-y-head</code> are memory locations used to store the x and
y coordinates of the head of the snake. 500 cells of memory are alloted after
these two locations to store the coordinates of the tail of the snake.</p>

<p>Next we define two words for accessing memory locations representing the body
of the snake.</p>

<div><pre><code>: snake-x ( offset -- address )
  cells snake-x-head + ;

: snake-y ( offset -- address )
  cells snake-y-head + ;
</code></pre></div>

<p>Just like the <code>number</code> word earlier, these two words are used to access
elements in the arrays of snake segments. After this come some words for
drawing to the canvas, described above.</p>

<p>We use constants to refer to the four directions (<code>left</code>, <code>up</code>, <code>right</code>, and
<code>down</code>), and a variable <code>direction</code> to store the current direction.</p>

<h4 id="initialization">Initialization</h4>

<p>After this we initialize everything:</p>

<div><pre><code>: draw-walls
  width 0 do
    i 0 draw-black
    i height 1 - draw-black
  loop
  height 0 do
    0 i draw-black
    width 1 - i draw-black
  loop ;

: initialize-snake
  4 length !
  length @ 1 + 0 do
    12 i - i snake-x !
    12 i snake-y !
  loop
  right direction ! ;

: set-apple-position apple-x ! apple-y ! ;

: initialize-apple  4 4 set-apple-position ;

: initialize
  width 0 do
    height 0 do
      j i draw-white
    loop
  loop
  draw-walls
  initialize-snake
  initialize-apple ;
</code></pre></div>

<p><code>draw-walls</code> uses two <code>do/loop</code>s to draw the horizontal and vertical walls,
respectively.</p>

<p><code>initialize-snake</code> sets the <code>length</code> variable to <code>4</code>, then loops from <code>0</code> to
<code>length + 1</code> filling in the starting snake positions. The snake positions are
always kept one longer than the length so we can grow the snake easily.</p>

<p><code>set-apple-position</code> and <code>initialize-apple</code> set the initial position of the
apple to (4,4).</p>

<p>Finally, <code>initialize</code> fills everything in white and calls the three
initialization words.</p>

<h4 id="moving-the-snake">Moving the Snake</h4>

<p>Here’s the code for moving the snake based on the current value of <code>direction</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code>: move-up  -1 snake-y-head +! ;
: move-left  -1 snake-x-head +! ;
: move-down  1 snake-y-head +! ;
: move-right  1 snake-x-head +! ;

: move-snake-head  direction @
  left over  = if move-left else
  up over    = if move-up else
  right over = if move-right else
  down over  = if move-down
  then then then then drop ;

\ Move each segment of the snake forward by one
: move-snake-tail  0 length @ do
    i snake-x @ i 1 + snake-x !
    i snake-y @ i 1 + snake-y !
  -1 +loop ;
</code></pre></div>

<p><code>move-up</code>, <code>move-left</code>, <code>move-down</code>, and <code>move-right</code> just add or subtract one
from the x or y coordinate of the snake head. <code>move-snake-head</code> inspects the
value of <code>direction</code> and calls the appropriate <code>move-*</code> word. This <code>over = if</code>
pattern is an idiomatic way of doing case statements in Forth.</p>

<p><code>move-snake-tail</code> goes through the array of snake positions backwards, copying
each value forward by 1 cell. This is called before we move the snake head, to
move each segment of the snake forward one space. It uses a <code>do/+loop</code>, a
variation of a <code>do/loop</code> that pops the stack on every iteration and adds that
value to the next index, instead of incrementing by 1 each time. So <code>0 length @
do -1 +loop</code> loops from <code>length</code> to <code>0</code> in increments of <code>-1</code>.</p>

<h4 id="keyboard-input-1">Keyboard Input</h4>

<p>The next section of code takes the keyboard input and changes the snake direction
if appropriate.</p>

<div><pre><code>: is-horizontal  direction @ dup
  left = swap
  right = or ;

: is-vertical  direction @ dup
  up = swap
  down = or ;

: turn-up     is-horizontal if up direction ! then ;
: turn-left   is-vertical if left direction ! then ;
: turn-down   is-horizontal if down direction ! then ;
: turn-right  is-vertical if right direction ! then ;

: change-direction ( key -- )
  37 over = if turn-left else
  38 over = if turn-up else
  39 over = if turn-right else
  40 over = if turn-down
  then then then then drop ;

: check-input
  last-key @ change-direction
  0 last-key ! ;
</code></pre></div>

<p><code>is-horizontal</code> and <code>is-vertical</code> check the current status of the <code>direction</code>
variable to see if it’s a horizontal or vertical direction.</p>

<p>The <code>turn-*</code> words are used to set a new direction, but use <code>is-horizontal</code> and
<code>is-vertical</code> to check the current direction first to see if the new direction
is valid. For example, if the snake is moving horizontally, setting a new
direction of <code>left</code> or <code>right</code> doesn’t make sense.</p>

<p><code>change-direction</code> takes a key and calls the appropriate <code>turn-*</code> word if the
key was one of the arrow keys. <code>check-input</code> does the work of getting the last
key from the <code>last-key</code> pseudo-variable, calling <code>change-direction</code>, then setting
<code>last-key</code> to 0 to indicate that the most recent keypress has been dealt with.</p>

<h4 id="the-apple">The Apple</h4>

<p>The next code is used for checking to see if the apple has been eaten, and if so,
moving it to a new (random) location. Also, if the apple has been eaten we grow
the snake.</p>

<div><pre><code>\ get random x or y position within playable area
: random-position ( -- pos )
  width 4 - random 2 + ;

: move-apple
  apple-x @ apple-y @ draw-white
  random-position random-position
  set-apple-position ;

: grow-snake  1 length +! ;

: check-apple ( -- flag )
  snake-x-head @ apple-x @ =
  snake-y-head @ apple-y @ =
  and if
    move-apple
    grow-snake
  then ;
</code></pre></div>

<p><code>random-position</code> generates a random x or y coordinate in the range of <code>2</code> to
<code>width - 2</code>. This prevents the apple from ever appearing right next to the wall.</p>

<p><code>move-apple</code> erases the current apple (using <code>draw-white</code>) then creates a new
pair of x/y coordinates for the apple using <code>random-position</code> twice. Finally,
it calls <code>set-apple-position</code> to move the apple to the new coordinates.</p>

<p><code>grow-snake</code> simply adds one to the <code>length</code> variable.</p>

<p><code>check-apple</code> compares the x/y coordinates of the apple and the snake head to
see if they’re the same (using <code>=</code> twice and <code>and</code> to combine the two
booleans). If the coordinates are the same, we call <code>move-apple</code> to move the
apple to a new position and <code>grow-snake</code> to make the snake 1 segment longer.</p>

<h4 id="collision-detection">Collision Detection</h4>

<p>Next we see if the snake has collided with the walls or itself.</p>

<div><pre><code>: check-collision ( -- flag )
  \ get current x/y position
  snake-x-head @ snake-y-head @

  \ get color at current position
  convert-x-y graphics + @

  \ leave boolean flag on stack
  0 = ;
</code></pre></div>

<p><code>check-collision</code> checks to see if the new snake head position is already black
(this word is called <em>after</em> updating the snake’s position but <em>before</em> drawing
it at the new position). We leave a boolean on the stack to say whether a
collision has occured or not.</p>

<h4 id="drawing-the-snake-and-apple">Drawing the Snake and Apple</h4>

<p>The next two words are responsible for drawing the snake and apple.</p>

<div><pre><code>: draw-snake
  length @ 0 do
    i snake-x @ i snake-y @ draw-black
  loop
  length @ snake-x @
  length @ snake-y @
  draw-white ;

: draw-apple
  apple-x @ apple-y @ draw-black ;
</code></pre></div>

<p><code>draw-snake</code> loops through each cell in the snake arrays, drawing a black pixel
for each one. After that it draws a white pixel at an offset of <code>length</code>. The
last part of the tail is at <code>length - 1</code> into the array so <code>length</code> holds the
previous last tail segment.</p>

<p><code>draw-apple</code> simply draws a black pixel at the apple’s current location.</p>

<h4 id="the-game-loop">The Game Loop</h4>

<p>The game loop constantly loops until a collision occurs, calling each of the
words defined above in turn.</p>

<div><pre><code>: game-loop ( -- )
  begin
    draw-snake
    draw-apple
    100 sleep
    check-input
    move-snake-tail
    move-snake-head
    check-apple
    check-collision
  until
  ." Game Over" ;

: start  initialize game-loop ;
</code></pre></div>

<p>The <code>begin/until</code> loop uses the boolean returned by <code>check-collision</code> to see
whether to continue looping or to exit the loop. When the loop is exited the
string <code>"Game Over"</code> is printed. We use <code>100 sleep</code> to pause for 100 ms every
iteration, making the game run at rougly 10 fps.</p>

<p><code>start</code> just calls <code>initialize</code> to reset everything, then kicks off <code>game-loop</code>.
Because all the initialization happens in the <code>initialize</code> word, you can call
<code>start</code> again after game over.</p>

<hr>

<p>And that’s it! Hopefully all the code in the game made sense. If not, you can
try running individual words to see their effect on the stack and/or on the
variables.</p>

<h2 id="the-end">The End</h2>

<p>Forth is actually much more powerful than what I’ve taught here (and what I
implemented in my interpreter). A true Forth system allows you to modify how
the compiler works and create new defining words, allowing you to completely
customize your environment and create your own languages within Forth.</p>

<p>A great resource for learning the full power of Forth is the short book
<a href="http://www.forth.com/starting-forth/">“Starting Forth”</a> by Leo Brodie. It’s
available for free online and teaches you all the fun stuff I left out. It also
has a good set of exercises for you to test out your knowledge. You’ll need to
download a copy of <a href="http://www.forth.com/swiftforth/dl.html">SwiftForth</a> to run
the code though.</p>

<p>A duo of Tesla shareholder-influencers tried to complete Elon Musk’s coast-to-coast self-driving ride that he claimed Tesla would be able to do in 2017 and they crashed before making it about 60 miles.</p>



<p>In 2016, Elon Musk infamously said that Tesla would complete a fully self-driving coast-to-coast drive between Los Angeles and New York by the end of 2017.</p>



<p>The idea was to livestream or film a full unedited drive coast-to-coast with the vehicle driving itself at all times.</p>



<p>We are in 2025 and Tesla never made that drive.</p>	
	



<p>Despite the many missed autonomous driving goals, many Tesla shareholders believe that the company is on the verge of delivering unsupervised self-driving following the rollout of its ‘Robotaxi’ fleet in Austin, which requires supervision from Tesla employees inside the vehicles, and improvements to its “Full Self-Driving” (FSD) systems inside consumer vehicles, which is still only a level 2 driver assist system that requires driver attention at all times as per Tesla.</p>



<p>Two of these Tesla shareholders and online influencers attempted to undertake a coast-to-coast drive between San Diego, CA, and Jacksonville, FL, in a Tesla Model Y equipped with the latest FSD software update.</p>



<p>They didn’t make it out of California without crashing into easily avoidable road debris that badly damaged the Tesla Model Y:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe id="post-youtube-video-1" title="Tesla Model Y - FSD Coast To Coast Attempt Part 2" width="500" height="281" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PMppm1m6jio?feature=oembed&amp;rel=0&amp;enablejsapi=1" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>In the video, you can see that the driver doesn’t have his hands on the steering wheel. The passenger spots the debris way ahead of time. There was plenty of time to react, but the driver didn’t get his hands on the steering wheel until the last second.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" height="450" width="1024" src="https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/09/Tesla-coast-to-coast-crash.gif?w=1024" alt=""></figure>



<p>In a follow-up video, the two Tesla influencers confirmed that the Model Y had a broken sway bar bracket and damaged suspension components.&nbsp;The vehicle is also throwing out a lot of warnings.</p>



<p>They made it about 2.5% of the planned trip on Tesla FSD v13.9 before crashing the vehicle.</p>



<h2 id="h-electrek-s-take">Electrek’s Take</h2>



<p>Tesla shareholders used to discuss this somewhat rationally back in the day, but now that Tesla’s EV business is in decline and the stock price depends entirely on the self-driving and robot promises, they no longer do.</p>



<p>I recall when Musk himself used to say that when you reach 99% self-driving, it is when the “march of the 9s” begins, and you must achieve 99.999999999% autonomy to have a truly useful self-driving system. He admitted that this is the most challenging part as the real-world is unpredictable and hard to simulate – throwing a lot of challenging scenario at you, such as debris on the road.</p>



<p>That’s where Tesla is right now. The hard part has just started. And there’s no telling how long it will take to get there. If someone is telling you that they know, they are lying. I don’t know. My best estimate is approximately 2-3 years and a new hardware suite.</p>



<p>However, competition, mainly Waymo, began its own “march of the 9s” about five years ago.</p>



<p>Tesla is still years behind, and something like this drive by these two Tesla influencers proves it.</p>




	<p>I was actually in a similar accident in a Tesla Model 3 back in 2020. I rented a Model 3 on Turo for a trip to Las Vegas from Los Angeles.</p>



<p>I ended up driving over a blown-out truck tire in the middle of the road like this. I was Autopilot, but I don’t know if the car saw it. I definitely saw it, but it was a bit late as I was following a truck that just drove over it. I had probably less than 2 seconds to react. I applied the brakes, but my choices were driving into a ditch on the right or into a car in the left lane.</p>



<p>I managed to reduce the force of the impact with the braking, but the vehicle jumped a bit like in this video. There wasn’t really any damage to the front, but the bottom cover was flapping down. I taped it together at the next gas station and I was able to continue the trip without much issue.</p>



<p>However, after returning it to the Turo owner and having the suspension damage evaluated by Tesla, the repair job was estimated to be roughly $10,000. I wouldn’t be surprised if there’s a similar situation with this accident.</p>

<article id="component_256568">
<p>Privacy Commissioner Carly Kind has found that Kmart Australia Limited (Kmart) breached Australians’ privacy by collecting their personal and sensitive information through a facial recognition technology (FRT) system designed to tackle refund fraud.</p><p>Between June 2020 and July 2022, Kmart deployed FRT to capture the faces of every person who entered 28 of its retail stores, and all individuals who presented at a returns counter, in an attempt to identify people committing refund fraud.</p><p>In a determination published today, the Privacy Commissioner found that Kmart did not notify shoppers or seek their consent to use FRT to collect their biometric information, which is sensitive personal information and enjoys higher protections under the Privacy Act.</p><p>The retailer argued that it was not required to obtain consent because of an exemption in the Privacy Act that applies when organisations reasonably believe that they need to collect personal information to tackle unlawful activity or serious misconduct. The Privacy Commissioner’s determination focused on assessing whether Kmart met the conditions for relying on the exemption, and concluded:</p><ul><li>The sensitive biometric information of every individual who entered a store was indiscriminately collected by the FRT system.</li><li>There were other less privacy intrusive methods available to Kmart to address refund fraud.</li><li>Deploying the FRT system to prevent fraud was of limited utility.</li><li>Considering that the FRT system impacted on the privacy of many thousands of individuals not suspected of refund fraud, the collection of biometric information on Kmart customers was a disproportionate interference with privacy.</li></ul><p>“Understanding how FRT accords with the protections contained in Privacy Act requires me to balance the interests of individuals in having their privacy protected, on the one hand, and the interests of entities in carrying out their functions or activities, on the other. Relevant to a technology like facial recognition, is also the public interest in protecting privacy,” the Privacy Commissioner said.</p><p>Relevant factors considered by the Commissioner included the estimated value of fraudulent returns against the respondent’s total operations and profits, the limited effectiveness of the FRT system, and the extent of the privacy impacts in collecting the sensitive information of every individual who entered the relevant stores.</p><p>“I do not consider that the respondent (Kmart) could have reasonably believed that the benefits of the FRT system in addressing refund fraud proportionately outweighed the impact on individuals’ privacy,” the Commissioner stated.</p><p>The determination is the second issued by the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) on the use of FRT in retail settings. In October 2024, the Privacy Commissioner found that Bunnings Group Limited had contravened Australians’ privacy through their use of FRT in 62 of its retail stores across Australia. That decision is currently under review by the Administrative Review Tribunal.</p><p>“These two decisions do not impose a ban on the use of FRT. The human rights to safety and privacy are not mutually exclusive; rather, both must be preserved, upheld and promoted. Customer and staff safety, and fraud prevention and detection, are legitimate reasons businesses might have regard to when considering the deployment of new technologies. However, these reasons are not, in and of themselves, a free pass to avoid compliance with the Privacy Act,” she stated.</p><p>The Commissioner’s determination is instructive for entities that are considering new technologies such as FRT. Privacy considerations should be a key feature. The OAIC has also published guidance on its website: <a href="https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/privacy-guidance-for-organisations-and-government-agencies/organisations/facial-recognition-technology-a-guide-to-assessing-the-privacy-risks">Facial recognition technology: a guide to assessing the privacy risks</a></p><p>Kmart has been under investigation by the OAIC since July 2022, at which time it ceased operating the FRT system. It has cooperated with the OAIC throughout the investigation.</p><p>Although the Privacy Commissioner reached a similar conclusion in the Kmart and Bunnings decisions, the cases differ considerably and focus on different uses of FRT.</p><p>The Privacy Act is technology-neutral and does not proscribe the use of any particular technology. When considering the roll-out and use of new technologies such as FRT, the OAIC’s guidance encourages entities to consider factors such as proportionality, transparency, the risk of bias and discrimination, and governance for the collection, use and retention of sensitive personal information.</p><p>Commissioner Kind has <a href="https://www.oaic.gov.au/news/blog/is-there-a-place-for-facial-recognition-in-australian-society">published a blog post</a> with further takeaways for other retailers considering using FRT.</p><p><a href="https://classic.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/AICmr/2025/155.html">View on AustLii</a>.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-611">

	<div>

					
<p>LinkedIn is preparing to switch on generative-AI training that draws from European members’ data, setting <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a8059228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">November 3, 2025</a> as the go-live date. The company says it will rely on “legitimate interests” as its legal basis and will offer an opt-out so members can refuse use of their data for training—promising that private messages are excluded. The change applies across the EU/EEA, United Kingdom, and Switzerland.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="790" height="237" src="https://hostvix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/linkedin-AI-update-notice-tos.png" alt="linkedin AI update notice tos" srcset="https://hostvix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/linkedin-AI-update-notice-tos.png 790w, https://hostvix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/linkedin-AI-update-notice-tos-300x90.png 300w, https://hostvix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/linkedin-AI-update-notice-tos-768x230.png 768w, https://hostvix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/linkedin-AI-update-notice-tos-440x132.png 440w, https://hostvix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/linkedin-AI-update-notice-tos-320x96.png 320w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 790px) 100vw, 790px"></figure>



<p>This is a pivot from last year’s pause. In September 2024, after criticism and scrutiny, LinkedIn <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/blog/member/trust-and-safety/updates-to-our-terms-of-service-2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">suspended plans</a> to train models on data from EU &amp; U.K. users.</p>



<p>What exactly will be used? LinkedIn’s help center explains that profile details and public content (posts, articles, comments) can feed content-generating models. The company also points to saved résumés and job-application answers as potential inputs to features that help members get discovered by recruiters, and it says it screens out minors it believes are in secondary school. It stresses that <strong>private messages</strong> are not part of the training set. The togglable setting appears as “Data for Generative AI Improvement,” and turning it off stops future use of your data for training, though it doesn’t unwind models already trained.</p>



<p>There’s a parallel—but separate—data-sharing change with Microsoft, LinkedIn’s parent. Beginning November 3, LinkedIn will expand, in some regions, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a1397243" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the types of LinkedIn data shared with Microsoft</a> so Microsoft can personalize ads. LinkedIn frames this as an “Affiliates” update; it says it will provide an additional opt-out where relevant. The two changes arrive together in the same terms refresh but follow different regional rules.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Outside EU/EEA/Switzerland and the UK, LinkedIn shares your information with our affiliate, Microsoft, for advertising purposes and with select partners for purposes of marketing LinkedIn’s products and services.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>For European members, the legal hinge is GDPR’s “legitimate interests.” That route allows processing without consent if a company can show necessity, transparency, and an effective right to object. LinkedIn’s <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy/eu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">European Regional Privacy Notice</a> update states that legitimate interests will be the basis for training content-generating models starting November 3, and that an objection (opt-out) will be honored via account settings.</p>



<p>Why now? LinkedIn has steadily added AI-assisted features—writing suggestions, profile summaries, recruiter tools—that benefit from domain-specific training. After the 2024 backlash (and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/microsofts-linkedin-sued-disclosing-customer-information-train-ai-models-2025-01-22/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a short-lived lawsuit in the U.S.</a> that centered on fears about private messages—claims LinkedIn denied and that were later withdrawn), the company has come back with region-specific notices, a single, named training setting, and clearer language that private messages aren’t in scope.</p>



<p>Practically, here’s what changes on (or around) November 3 in Europe: if you do nothing, LinkedIn may use parts of your profile and public activity to refine the models behind its content-generation features. If you object in settings, that use should stop for future training. Your ability to <strong>use</strong> AI features doesn’t depend on opting in. In parallel, some—but not all—regions will see broader ad-personalization data sharing with Microsoft, governed by a separate control. Expect some differences in labels and availability by market; LinkedIn says not all features and settings roll out worldwide at once.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="787" height="299" src="https://hostvix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Data-for-Generative-AI-Improvement.png" alt="Data for Generative AI Improvement
" srcset="https://hostvix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Data-for-Generative-AI-Improvement.png 787w, https://hostvix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Data-for-Generative-AI-Improvement-300x114.png 300w, https://hostvix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Data-for-Generative-AI-Improvement-768x292.png 768w, https://hostvix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Data-for-Generative-AI-Improvement-440x167.png 440w, https://hostvix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Data-for-Generative-AI-Improvement-320x122.png 320w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 787px) 100vw, 787px"></figure>



<p>If you want out, the setting to look for is “Data for Generative AI Improvement” in <strong>Settings → Data privacy</strong>. The key is that the toggle affects <strong>future</strong> training, not models already built. Keep an eye out for any region-specific notices in your account banner over the next few weeks as the company aligns the U.K. with the EU schedule.</p>

   <p>10.09.2025 | Frederik Ramm </p>

   <div>
      <p>This month we’ve ramped up the infrastructure behind the download server, and downloads should now be available earlier<br>
and faster. There’s also a small technical change in that requests for a “…latest” file will now be answered with a<br>
HTTP redirect to the specific latest version (see previous blog post).</p>
<p>I would like to use this opportunity to appeal to users of the download server to “download responsibly”. We want<br>
to continue offering this service as powerful and as convenient as possible within our means. We want everyone<br>
to have easy access to the latest OSM data in a form that is useful to them.</p>
<p>Every now and then, people break things for others. There have been individual clients downloading the exact same<br>
20-GB file 100s of times per day, for several days in a row. (Just the other day, one user has managed to download almost 10,000 copies of the italy-latest.osm.pbf file in 24 hours!) Others download every single file we have on the<br>
server, every day. There’s a limit to the outgoing network bandwidth, and behaviour like this means that<br>
things are slowing down for everyone. Also, when we block an IP range for abuse, innocent third parties can be affected. </p>
<p>Here’s three concrete appeals to users of the download server:</p>
<p>1. If you want data for the whole planet, don’t download it piecemeal from us – simply get the planet file from planet.openstreetmap.org and you’re done!<br>
2. If you want a large region (like Europe or North America) updated daily, use the excellent pyosmium-up-to-date program which will automatically determine the age of your local file and update it by downloading the latest changes; this saves something like 98% of network traffic compared to a fresh download, and is faster.<br>
3. If you automate anything with regard to our download server, monitor what your script is doing or build in appropriate catches so that you don’t end up downloading the same file 1000 times just because your disk is full or something like that.</p>
<p>Happy downloading!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="auto"><p><span>“</span><a href="https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/7um9a" rel="">Reconstructing Psychopathology: A data-driven reorganization of the symptoms in DSM-5</a><span>” by Miri Forbes, et al. (was available as a preprint at the time of writing this post, later </span><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/21677026241268345" rel="">published in </a><em><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/21677026241268345" rel="">Clinical Psychological Science</a></em><span>) is a brilliantly designed and innovative study of the quantitative structure of psychopathology with important ramifications for our understanding of psychiatric classification. No one has conducted a study quite like this before, and the results are remarkable. It takes place in the context of the development of </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_Taxonomy_of_Psychopathology" rel="">Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology (HiTOP)</a><span> which is a dimensional, hierarchical, and quantitative approach to the classification of mental disorders, and relies on identification of patterns of covariation among symptoms.</span></p><p><span>The study is based on a large online survey, with participants recruited from a variety of sources, resulting in a socio-demographically diverse sample size of 14.8K participants. Participants could opt to complete a mini, short, medium, or long version of the questionnaire. The survey consisted of items based on individual symptoms derived from DSM-5. Symptoms were written in first person and past tense, as close to the DSM phrasing as possible but devoid of information about symptom onset, duration, frequency, and severity. Importantly, survey items were presented to participants in a </span><em>random order</em><span>. This randomness is important because in prior studies questions about symptoms were not asked or presented in a random manner. They have been asked using symptom questionnaires that cluster symptoms together in ways influenced by the diagnostic manuals or using a structured clinical interview that adopts the DSM organization. Asking about symptoms in a random order ensures that their co-occurrence is not artificially influenced by the order in which questions are asked. The survey went through multiple rounds of pilot testing, and in the end, 680 items were included. Participants reported how true each symptom statement was for them in the past 12 months on a five-point scale from </span><em>Not at all true (Never)</em><span> to </span><em>Perfectly true (Always)</em><span>. Participants were told to think about their experiences across a wide variety of contexts.</span></p><p><span>The responses were subjected to two statistical clustering methods: </span><em>iclust</em><span> and Ward’s hierarchical agglomerative clustering. Clusters were accepted for further analysis when both methods agreed. This was intended to ensure that there were no idiosyncrasies arising from reliance on one method. This resulted in 139 clusters (“syndromes”) and 81 solo symptoms. Higher-order constructs were identified using hierarchical principal components analysis and hierarchical clustering. The sample was divided into a primary sample (11.8K) and a hold-out sample (3K) to examine the robustness of results. The final classification was based on points of agreement between samples and methods.</span></p><p>The final high order structure included 8 spectra: Externalizing, Harmful Substance Use, Mania/Low Detachment, Thought Disorder, Somatoform, Eating Pathology, Internalizing, and Neurodevelopmental and Cognitive Difficulties. 27 subfactors were identified. As an example, within the internalizing spectrum, the 4 subfactors were: Distress, Social Withdrawal, Dysregulated Sleep and Trauma, and Fear. Similar to earlier literature, a single overarching dimension also emerged. This has been described before as the “p-factor” (general psychopathology factor), but Forbes et al. chose to call it the “Big Everything” to avoid reifying it.</p><p>So here it is, an empirically derived hierarchical clustering of individual symptoms across the range of psychopathology:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BifU!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F566fdb24-d95f-474c-9cf3-d3a62e242d25_2564x1433.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BifU!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F566fdb24-d95f-474c-9cf3-d3a62e242d25_2564x1433.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BifU!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F566fdb24-d95f-474c-9cf3-d3a62e242d25_2564x1433.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BifU!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F566fdb24-d95f-474c-9cf3-d3a62e242d25_2564x1433.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BifU!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F566fdb24-d95f-474c-9cf3-d3a62e242d25_2564x1433.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BifU!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F566fdb24-d95f-474c-9cf3-d3a62e242d25_2564x1433.png" width="1456" height="814" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/566fdb24-d95f-474c-9cf3-d3a62e242d25_2564x1433.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:814,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:298979,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BifU!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F566fdb24-d95f-474c-9cf3-d3a62e242d25_2564x1433.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BifU!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F566fdb24-d95f-474c-9cf3-d3a62e242d25_2564x1433.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BifU!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F566fdb24-d95f-474c-9cf3-d3a62e242d25_2564x1433.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BifU!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F566fdb24-d95f-474c-9cf3-d3a62e242d25_2564x1433.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Forbes, et al. 2023.</figcaption></figure></div><p>The end result has a prominent convergence with the existing HiTOP model, with some points of divergence that would be important for future revisions of HiTOP.</p><p>Due to the symptom heterogeneity of DSM constructs, they are either broken down into smaller homogenous syndromes or they merge into higher-order clusters such as subfactors and spectra.

In a similar manner, GAD indexes a varying and heterogenous subset of symptoms/syndromes, and what is common about these varying subsets is that pervasive anxiety is a prominent aspect of the presentation. And PTSD indexes a varying and heterogenous subset of symptoms/syndromes, and what is common about these varying subsets is that traumatic intrusions and avoidance are prominent aspects of the presentation. The subsets that constitute MDD, GAD, and PTSD all overlap, which is why these heterogenous categories dissolve when statistical homogeneity is sought. (This is also one reason why the reliability for MDD and GAD was so low in DSM-5 field trials.)</p><p>You can see in the figure below how MDD dissolves into homogenous elements that map onto ‘Distress,’ ‘Neurocognitive Impairment,’ ‘Dysregulated Sleep,’ and ‘Dysregulated Eating.’</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!DtzM!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb61a4b86-d639-4f63-962b-addf692334e5_1523x869.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!DtzM!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb61a4b86-d639-4f63-962b-addf692334e5_1523x869.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!DtzM!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb61a4b86-d639-4f63-962b-addf692334e5_1523x869.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!DtzM!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb61a4b86-d639-4f63-962b-addf692334e5_1523x869.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!DtzM!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb61a4b86-d639-4f63-962b-addf692334e5_1523x869.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!DtzM!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb61a4b86-d639-4f63-962b-addf692334e5_1523x869.png" width="1456" height="831" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b61a4b86-d639-4f63-962b-addf692334e5_1523x869.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:831,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:390570,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!DtzM!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb61a4b86-d639-4f63-962b-addf692334e5_1523x869.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!DtzM!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb61a4b86-d639-4f63-962b-addf692334e5_1523x869.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!DtzM!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb61a4b86-d639-4f63-962b-addf692334e5_1523x869.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!DtzM!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb61a4b86-d639-4f63-962b-addf692334e5_1523x869.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Detail from a figure in Forbes et al.</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>Ken Kendler notes in his </span><a href="https://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/appi.ajp.2016.15121509" rel="">historical review of depression symptoms and the DSM</a><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>“… the author examines how well DSM-5 symptomatic criteria for major depression capture the descriptions of clinical depression in the post-Kraepelin Western psychiatric tradition as described in textbooks published between 1900 and 1960. Eighteen symptoms and signs of depression were described, 10 of which are covered by the DSM criteria for major depression or melancholia. For two symptoms (mood and cognitive content), DSM criteria are considerably narrower than those described in the textbooks. Five symptoms and signs (changes in volition/motivation, slowing of speech, anxiety, other physical symptoms, and depersonalization/derealization) are not present in the DSM criteria. Compared with the DSM criteria, these authors gave greater emphasis to cognitive, physical, and psychomotor changes, and less to neurovegetative symptoms. These results suggest that important features of major depression are not captured by DSM criteria. This is unproblematic as long as DSM criteria are understood to&nbsp;</span><em>index</em><span>&nbsp;rather than&nbsp;</span><em>constitute</em><span>&nbsp;psychiatric disorders. However, since DSM-III, our field has moved toward a reification of DSM that implicitly assumes that psychiatric disorders are actually just the DSM criteria. That is, we have taken an index of something for the thing itself.”</span></p></blockquote><p><span>DSM criteria for MDD are an index, but what is the </span><em>thing itself</em><span>? If Forbes et al. are correct, the thing itself isn’t a fixed, stable entity but consists of variable and heterogenous subsets of internalizing and neurocognitive symptoms.

It relies only on self-reported symptoms, and features requiring clinician observation are missing; symptoms are decontextualized (e.g., insomnia due to substance withdrawal isn’t differentiated from insomnia due to anxiety); all symptoms were assessed using a 12-month time scale, even though different symptom patterns exist at different time scales. </p><p>Forbes et al. themselves note,</p><blockquote><p>“It will also be essential to understand which aspects of these results—particularly the fine-grained levels of the structure—are robust to other approaches to measurement (i.e., using alternative measures, time frames, multi-method or multi-informant approaches, as well as within-person assessment) and across intersectional conceptualizations of identity (e.g., in a variety of sociodemographic and culturally and linguistically diverse samples).”</p></blockquote><p>See also:</p><div data-component-name="DigestPostEmbed"><a href="https://www.psychiatrymargins.com/p/common-misconceptions-about-the-clinical" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!1RXz!,w_140,h_140,c_fill,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5faac8bc-eff8-430a-bfd7-e4c8f16c805b_2999x1684.png"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!1RXz!,w_140,h_140,c_fill,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5faac8bc-eff8-430a-bfd7-e4c8f16c805b_2999x1684.png" sizes="100vw" alt="Common Misconceptions About the Clinical Use of HiTOP" width="140" height="140"></picture></div></a></div><div data-component-name="DigestPostEmbed"><a href="https://www.psychiatrymargins.com/p/are-critiques-of-dsmicd-as-devastating" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!grCP!,w_140,h_140,c_fill,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F30f5d1be-a3e1-4571-9ac3-93672932c080_600x600.png"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!grCP!,w_140,h_140,c_fill,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F30f5d1be-a3e1-4571-9ac3-93672932c080_600x600.png" sizes="100vw" alt="Are Critiques of DSM/ICD as Devastating for Psychiatric Diagnosis as Some Critics Seem to Think?" width="140" height="140"></picture></div></a></div><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.psychiatrymargins.com/p/traditional-dsm-disorders-dissolve?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://www.psychiatrymargins.com/p/traditional-dsm-disorders-dissolve?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p></div></div>]]></description>

  <p>“Hello! I am a developer. Here is my relevant experience: I code in Hoobijag and sometimes jabbernocks and of course ABCDE++++ (but never ABCDE+/^+ are you kidding? ha!)&nbsp; and I like working with Shoobababoo and occasionally kleptomitrons. I’ve gotten to work for Company<sup id="fnref:1"><a data-id="3e2870f0-6d85-441d-a696-e5a4d36ac28e" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> doing Shoobaboo-ing code things and that’s what led me to the Snarfus. So, let’s dive in!&nbsp;</p>
<p>↑ Excerpt ↑</p>
<p>About this tutorial</p>
<p>I first started doing Very Simple Thing<sup id="fnref:2"><a data-id="8df4a1c7-7308-48cc-b322-fa39c18e069b" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> with Snarfus, but the more I used it the more I saw the potential! Despite the jaggle of the chromus, it’s really multi-purpose. And that’s what led me to argyling the pintafore with the quagmire instead of the hoobastank! I know, crazy. But it was kind of working, and actually a lot of fun… Until I hit a big roadblock: the fisterfunk will NOT talk to the shamrock portal or even send beep-boops back to the Snarfus! Of course, you know what that means<sup id="fnref:3"><a data-id="ffe570ad-86df-49e0-8d9b-debc850a3651" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>&nbsp;— Now the entire hoob-tunnel is clogged with gramelions. Unacceptable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I almost gave up but then I realized: If I connect the backside Snarfus stagnator to the backside shamrock Klingon troglodyte emulater, it’s good! Everything beep-boops and ding-dongs and I get the Actual Topic of the Tutorial, which lets me do the Very Simple Thing the way I want after all! Pretty cool<sup id="fnref:4"><a data-id="b039c94a-7f18-4d43-86eb-8ac46b97574a" href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>.</p>
<p>So here’s how to set it up:&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><p>In the terminal, ajkl;gawgor;iqeg;iJLkqen.&nbsp; wl;R aw;oeiga 4648664 arjarwgj;llj;ja fadgfgajkljl; wlj;sdjk;lfas</p></li>
<li><p>Next go to folder/hidden/deep/in/the/file/system/surprise!.file and copy the contents of the file. If it’s not there, it might be in library/library/library/llibrary/liiiiiibrarrrary/llllliiiiibrary/hidden/hidden/hiding/you can’t find me/hidden/nope/never/hahahahereiam.file.</p></li>
<li><p>Now go back to the terminal and paste in the file contents, then type in 64A786AGR45JAR; rdja;jg [[]][[]][[]][[]]][[]()()()()()()()()(){{}{}{}|{}{|}{}{|}{ ////////////////!! !!!! !! //// !!! agjlkargji;lwej;OI [ASRGASG[]ASGDASG[]EAEadgasg[]EAGE[edaga][]ahgr-0-0=-0-=0-=0=0-0=-0-=0=-0-=0=-0=-0!!!</p></li>
<li><p>Boop!<sup id="fnref:5"><a data-id="1385bd5d-ec29-4fdf-bdcb-65fb027612bf" href="#fn:5">5</a></sup></p></li>
<li><p>Open Snarfus and upload the file you just made.&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><p>Just for shits and giggles, you<em>&nbsp;</em>can de-sham the chronostatiomatrix by running —()()(]]asdg a=-do —cd go cd stay —sususudododo baby shark—][] but that’s optional.&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><p>That’s it!&nbsp;</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Let me know how it goes for you. I’d love to hear if anybody uses this approach with GewGawGamma or ometer2.7.”</p>
<ol>
<li id="fn:1" data-id="3e2870f0-6d85-441d-a696-e5a4d36ac28e"><p>I probably should recognize Company because it seems illustrious but I do not recognize Company or know what they do.&nbsp; <a href="#fnref:1">↵</a></p></li>
<li id="fn:2" data-id="8df4a1c7-7308-48cc-b322-fa39c18e069b"><p>It is not simple.&nbsp; <a href="#fnref:2">↵</a></p></li>
<li id="fn:3" data-id="ffe570ad-86df-49e0-8d9b-debc850a3651"><p>I do<em> </em>not&nbsp;know what that means.&nbsp; <a href="#fnref:3">↵</a></p></li>
<li id="fn:4" data-id="b039c94a-7f18-4d43-86eb-8ac46b97574a"><p>It<em> is</em>&nbsp;cool. I don’t really understand how, but I believe it. I’m glad you know how to do it.&nbsp; <a href="#fnref:4">↵</a></p></li>
<li id="fn:5" data-id="1385bd5d-ec29-4fdf-bdcb-65fb027612bf">
<p>The first 3 steps will take me approximately 7 hours and 193 internet searches to complete. When I finally get to Boop! it will be really satisfying.</p>
<p><strong><em>This is meant in good fun. I really appreciate the folks who take time to share their knowledge and write up tutorials and give tips and so on.&nbsp;</em></strong> <a href="#fnref:5">↵</a></p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Large language models (LLMs) struggle to navigate culturally specific communication norms, limiting their effectiveness in global contexts. We focus on Persian taarof, a social norm in Iranian interactions, which is a sophisticated system of ritual politeness that emphasizes deference, modesty, and indirectness, yet remains absent from existing cultural benchmarks. We introduce TaarofBench, the first benchmark for evaluating LLM understanding of taarof, comprising 450 role-play scenarios covering 12 common social interaction topics, validated by native speakers. Our evaluation of five frontier LLMs reveals substantial gaps in cultural competence, with accuracy rates 40-48% below native speakers when taarof is culturally appropriate. Performance varies between interaction topics, improves with Persian-language prompts, and exhibits gender-based asymmetries. We also show that responses rated "polite" by standard metrics often violate taarof norms, indicating the limitations of Western politeness frameworks. Through supervised fine-tuning and Direct Preference Optimization, we achieve 21.8% and 42.3% improvement in model alignment with cultural expectations. Our human study with 33 participants (11 native Persian, 11 heritage, and 11 non-Iranian speakers) forms baselines in varying degrees of familiarity with Persian norms. This work lays the foundation for developing diverse and culturally aware LLMs, enabling applications that better navigate complex social interactions.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>Go has a feature called struct embedding that allows you to compose types. It looks something like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>type</span> <span>Position</span> <span>struct</span> {
	<span>X</span> <span>int</span>
	<span>Y</span> <span>int</span>
}

<span>type</span> <span>Colour</span> <span>struct</span> {
	<span>R</span> <span>byte</span>
	<span>G</span> <span>byte</span>
	<span>B</span> <span>byte</span>
}

<span>type</span> <span>Rectangle</span> <span>struct</span> {
	<span>Position</span>
	<span>Colour</span>
	
	<span>Width</span>  <span>int</span>
	<span>Height</span> <span>int</span>
}

<span>r</span> <span>:=</span> <span>Rectangle</span>{<span>/* ... */</span>}

<span>// This works:</span>
<span>fmt</span>.<span>Printf</span>(<span>"%d,%d\n"</span>, <span>r</span>.<span>Position</span>.<span>X</span>, <span>r</span>.<span>Position</span>.<span>Y</span>)

<span>// but so does this:</span>
<span>fmt</span>.<span>Printf</span>(<span>"%d,%d\n"</span>, <span>r</span>.<span>X</span>, <span>r</span>.<span>Y</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>But what do you think this code does?</p>
<pre><code><span>type</span> <span>FooService</span> <span>struct</span> {
	<span>URL</span> <span>string</span>
}

<span>type</span> <span>BarConnectionOptions</span> <span>struct</span> {
	<span>URL</span> <span>string</span>
}

<span>type</span> <span>BarService</span> <span>struct</span> {
	<span>BarConnectionOptions</span>
}

<span>type</span> <span>Options</span> <span>struct</span> {
	<span>FooService</span>
	<span>BarService</span>
}

<span>opts</span> <span>:=</span> <span>Options</span>{
	<span>FooService</span>: <span>FooService</span>{<span>URL</span>: <span>"abc.com"</span>},
	<span>BarService</span>: <span>BarService</span>{
		<span>BarConnectionOptions</span>: <span>BarConnectionOptions</span>{
			<span>URL</span>: <span>"xyz.com"</span>,
		},
	},
}

<span>fmt</span>.<span>Println</span>(<span>opts</span>.<span>URL</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>I would expect this to fail to compile as <code>URL</code> is ambiguous. It actually prints <code>abc.com</code>, presumably as it is the least nested version of that field. This happened at the day job, although it was caught in a test. Be careful when embedding structs!</p>

    <p><span>V</span>enus is arguably the worst place in the solar system. A cloak of carbon dioxide suffocates the planet, subjecting its surface to skull-crushing pressure. Sulfuric acid rains down through the sickly yellow sky but never reaches the lava-licked ground. Venus is so hot — hot enough to melt lead — that the acid rain evaporates as it’s falling.</p>
<p>The planet’s extreme inhospitality is at the heart of one of the most beguiling mysteries in planetary science. Venus and Earth formed at the same time, from the same geologic building blocks, in pretty much the same part of the solar system. They’re even the same size. So why is Venus a hellscape, and Earth a garden?</p>
<p>A common refrain in the scientific community is that Venus is just several steps ahead — that it represents the end state of all large rocky planets, including Earth. The hypothesis is that these planets eventually lose the ability to sequester planet-warming greenhouse gases in their geologic underbelly. When those gases then accumulate in the atmosphere, the world enters a runaway greenhouse state — like the boiling hot Venusian climate. “Over the years, we’d always heard about Venus being a preview into Earth’s future,” said <a href="https://profiles.ucr.edu/app/home/profile/skane">Stephen Kane</a>, a planetary astrophysicist at the University of California, Riverside.</p>

<p>But is that long-held assumption true? In hundreds of millions or billions of years, will Earth’s climate go the way of Venus’, transitioning from a temperate world into a catastrophic hothouse? Kane and his colleagues have been trying to find out. Venus and Earth are often referred to as twins, with Venus being the evil one of the pair. In their Reuniting Twins project, the scientists have developed a digital model of Earth that combines solar physics, volcanology, plate tectonics and climate science. They’ve been pushing their model Earth to its extremes, trying every plausible way to break it and make it into Venus.</p>
<p>As well as exploring what went so wrong on the second rock from the sun, this work speaks to a query closer to home, said <a href="https://eeps.wustl.edu/people/paul-byrne">Paul Byrne</a>, a planetary scientist at Washington University in St. Louis who was not directly involved with the project: “How long is Earth habitable for?”</p>

    <h2><strong>A Planetary Whodunit</strong></h2>
<p>Forecasting Earth’s future requires an understanding of Venus’ past. Long ago, Venus might not have been too different from how Earth is now. Spacecraft surveys and telescope observations have revealed the existence of a rare, heavy form of water in the Venusian atmosphere — a telltale sign that regular water used to be abundant on the planet.</p>
<p>Researchers debate how that water resided there. One possibility is that the water on young Venus formed steam that wafted above the magma sea covering the newborn planet’s surface. That water vapor, a potent greenhouse gas, would have pushed the world into a scorching-hot greenhouse state not long after its birth. Alternatively, Venus’ initial, planetwide magma sea might have cooled and hardened into a crust quickly enough for liquid water — maybe even <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/nasa-just-broke-the-venus-curse-heres-what-it-took/">an ocean’s worth of water</a> — to flow across it. If that is true, then what happened to all that water?</p>
<p>In 2020, <a href="https://science.gsfc.nasa.gov/sci/bio/michael.j.way">Michael Way</a>, a planetary scientist and climate modeler at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York, looked at <a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2019JE006276">two possibilities</a> for how a Venusian ocean could have boiled away.</p>
    
    
    
    
<p>The first hypothesis points to the sun, which, as it ages and burns through its hydrogen fuel, blasts out ever more sunlight, subjecting nearby planets — including Venus, which sits closer to the sun than we do — to an increasingly intense blaze. Planetary scientists estimate that by about a billion years after the solar system’s birth, the gradually brightening sun would have been able to efficiently vaporize any liquid water on Venus. Water vapor would then have flooded the Venusian atmosphere, potentially causing intensive global warming; this warming might have been exacerbated further by volcanoes off-gassing carbon dioxide. The combination might have pushed Venus into a runaway greenhouse state.</p>
<p>It’s a nice story. But according to Way’s models, the theory that the sun broke Venus by evaporating its oceans has problems. Venus spins very slowly on its axis, and one day there is equivalent to 116 Earth days, or nearly four months. If the planet’s dayside initially held liquid oceans, that water’s evaporation would have formed thick clouds. Those prodigious, persistent dayside clouds would have reflected sunlight, keeping Venus cooler than it otherwise might have been and actually preventing a runaway <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/physicists-pinpoint-the-quantum-origin-of-the-greenhouse-effect-20240807/">greenhouse effect</a> and unrestrained global warming.</p>
<p>Way thinks that a more plausible suspect in Venus’ demise is a form of ruinous volcanism. In its own storied past, Earth experienced prolonged eruptions of lava in single regions, known as large igneous provinces (LIPs), that lasted for hundreds of thousands and perhaps millions of years. Each of these events injected copious carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and made the world, for a time, extremely hot. One LIP 252 million years ago <a href="https://doi.org/10.1130/G47365.1">triggered</a> the <a href="https://news.st-andrews.ac.uk/archive/great-dying-what-caused-earths-biggest-mass-extinction/">worst recorded mass extinction in Earth’s history</a>, almost sterilizing the planet.</p>

    <p>Fortunately for life, after each of these LIP events, Earth gradually drew that excess carbon dioxide deep into its rocky bowels, and the planet cooled back down. It accomplished this through a process called subduction: When tectonic plates collide, one plate can descend below the other, drawing seawater rich in dissolved carbon dioxide into the abyssal depths. That carbon remains sequestered in the lower mantle for epochal lengths of time; some of it eventually erupts back into the atmosphere via volcanism. That, in a nutshell, is how <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/a-biography-of-earth-across-the-age-of-animals-20250915/">Earth’s global thermostat</a> is regulated.</p>

<p>It’s possible that back when there was water on Venus, it also had Earth-like plate tectonics with major subduction zones. But the system wasn’t widespread or large-scale enough to save it from a planetary immolation — especially if several LIP events occurred at roughly the same time. Way’s models show that several concurrent LIPs could have thrown vast quantities of carbon dioxide into Venus’ atmosphere, warming the world so severely that much of its liquid water boiled away into the sky, accelerating the warming further. With no oceans to speak of, all that carbon dioxide could not be reabsorbed. Moreover, water is an enabler of subduction: It lowers the melting point of rocks, allowing tectonic plates to more easily bend and break. And so, with no water left at the surface, major subduction zones would grind to a halt, preventing the entombment of carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>Other scientists tend to agree with Way’s assessment: The sun alone cannot be responsible for making Venus the awful place it is today. “I really do think you need multiple extreme volcanic episodes … to get there,” said <a href="https://annagulcher.com/">Anna Gülcher</a>, a planetary scientist at the University of Bern in Switzerland.</p>
<h2><strong>How to Break the World</strong></h2>
<p>While studying Venus and its runaway greenhouse wasteland, Kane became morbidly curious: Could the same fate befall Earth? “What if we shut down the carbon cycle on Earth?” he said. “Could you produce a Venus?”</p>
<p>To find out, he and his team built a virtual world-destroying machine. “Everybody loves a post-apocalyptic or doomsday scenario, provided it’s 5 billion years in our future,” he said.</p>

    <p>The first step was to fast-forward their model of Earth about 3.5 billion years, to when the sun and planets will be 8 billion years old. At that point, the sun will shine brighter than it does today, and Earth’s atmosphere will receive the same level of roasting-hot starlight that Venus did when it was just 1 billion years old. Back then, it’s thought, Venus would have been at a tipping point: either temperate and waterlogged, or burnt to a crisp. The 8 billion-year-old sun will push Earth to a similar, climatic knife-edge.</p>
<p>The team’s model suggests that in 3.5 billion years, Earth’s oceans could begin evaporating and become heat-trapping water vapor in the atmosphere. That could be sufficient to kill off Earth’s major subduction zones, since without water, there might be no subduction (plus, there would be less water for carbon dioxide to dissolve into in the first place). “We’re losing the ability to draw back that CO<sub>2</sub> into the Earth’s mantle. So it just builds up,” said <a href="https://www.michellehillphd.com/">Michelle Hill</a> of Stanford University, a member of the Reuniting Twins project.</p>
<p>The shutdown of major subduction zones would mean that the Earth’s tectonic plates stop clashing and jostling about. Instead, they would form a near-united rocky shell around the hot mantle. For a time, the mantle would get hotter, since the shell around it would trap heat generated by radioactively decaying compounds inside it. As heat accumulates in the interior, the Earth in Kane’s simulations would experience an uptick in volcanism lasting for about 15 million years.</p>
<p>This period, known as a “stagnant lid regime,” adds even more carbon dioxide to the sky. But the eruptive spike is short-lived. The mantle cools down and the crust thickens until it becomes nearly impermeable to any major carbon-erupting volcanism.</p>
<p>So 15 million years after its stagnant lid forms, Earth will have reached a new equilibrium. Occasional spurts of volcanism would still happen. (Likewise, scientists have found <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/venus-is-volcanically-alive?loggedin=true&amp;rnd=1716366279998">compelling</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/27/science/venus-volcanoes-lava.html">evidence</a> that Venus is volcanically active today.) But Kane explained that these sporadic eruptions aren’t expected to add much carbon to the atmosphere.</p>
<p>At that point, the team’s simulations stop. How Venus-like is their model of the future Earth?</p>

    <h2><strong>There’s No Place Like Venus</strong></h2>
<p>If or when Earth’s large-scale subduction shuts off in about 3.5 billion years, kneecapping the planet’s ability to bury carbon, Kane and his team’s simulations indicate that the carbon dioxide level in the atmosphere will rise anywhere from 0.1 bars to 0.8 bars. (For reference, the total atmospheric pressure at sea level today is 1 bar, and roughly 0.04% of that, or 0.042 bars, comes from carbon dioxide.) Even in their best-case scenario of a 0.1-bar rise in carbon dioxide, Earth’s surface temperature surpasses 100 degrees Celsius (212 degrees Fahrenheit). The same happens at 0.8 bars, but far more quickly.</p>
<p>Either way, the surface of the world becomes literally boiling hot. Earth will “turn into a post-runaway greenhouse state,” Kane said. “The surface temperature will be too hot for any water. It’ll all boil away.” Nothing sitting on the world’s skin would survive.</p>
<p>Still, Earth won’t get close to the state that Venus is in today. “It’d be Venus lite,” Kane said.</p>
<p>Venus has a 93-bar atmosphere consisting of 96.5% carbon dioxide. Kane and his colleagues’ doomsday machine, no matter how hard they push it, cannot take Earth to those levels. “I was surprised by that,” he said. Because the mantle is sealed off by a stagnant lid, volcanism drops, protecting Earth from a Venus-style roasting better than he thought.</p>
<p>Independent scientists have praised the Reuniting Twins project for challenging prior assumptions and adding significantly to the discussion about the terminal state of rocky planets.</p>
        
        
<p>“I like their idea,” Way said, adding that the team’s version of a future Earth “doesn’t sound unreasonable.”</p>
<p>“You end up with a world that’s stinkingly hot,” said Byrne, the Washington University planetary scientist. But, he said, the possibility that it may not be Venusian levels of hot is intriguing.</p>
<p>Kane’s team acknowledged that their model hasn’t considered LIP-style mega-eruptions, and that these events could feasibly add a bounty of trapped carbon to the atmosphere at any point in the future. Maybe Earth gets unlucky and experiences multiple, simultaneous LIP events (though this grows less likely over time, Kane said, as the mantle cools and its churning slows). If so, that scenario could push Earth to be more like Venus than the team’s model suggests.</p>
<p>Uncertainties abound. But if Kane’s team is even broadly correct, it suggests that Venus has a uniquely grim history. Something — perhaps an inundation of lava — burned that planet to the bone. Earth, meanwhile, has so far been unable to bring about its own destruction. Let’s hope that remains the case long into the future.</p>

															<h2>How can I influence others without manipulating them?</h2>										<div>
				<p>We influence others every day, whether we intend to or not. Sometimes it is through the way we argue, sometimes through the way we listen, and sometimes simply through the story we tell about what matters. Influence is not the property of the few who hold authority. It is the currency of all relationships.</p>
<p>The word persuasion often carries with it the scent of manipulation, as though one person is moving another toward something they do not really want. But there is another way to hold it. Influence can be understood as an invitation. It is the art of meeting people where they are, of entering their world with respect, and of opening a door that they might choose to walk through with us.</p>
<p>This article invites you to consider five doors of influence: Rationalising, Asserting, Negotiating, Inspiring, and Bridging. Each opens a different path into relationship and commitment. Each has its gifts. Each, when overused, can become a wall instead of a door.</p>
<p>The practice is not to master all five overnight, but to grow our awareness and our range. Persuasion is not a personality trait. It is a skill. It asks us to listen, to notice, and to choose consciously how we invite others.</p>
<h2>Our own doorway: The blind spot of preference</h2>
<p>Most of us have a default style of persuasion. Perhaps you lean on facts. Perhaps you rely on conviction. Perhaps you search for compromise, tell stories, or call on the voices of others. None of these is wrong. Each is a doorway.</p>
<p>Yet our default does more than shape how we speak. It shapes how we see. If I lean on data, I may hear someone’s story as weak rather than inspiring. If I favour conviction, I may interpret hesitation as lack of commitment, when it might be an opening for negotiation. If I thrive on inspiration, I may dismiss detail-oriented questions as nit-picking rather than as a real need for clarity. If I am most comfortable with bridging, I may feel uneasy with those who are direct and independent.</p>
<p>Our own doorway becomes a filter. It colours what we pay attention to, what we dismiss, and how we react. The danger is that we mistake difference for resistance. We think they are being difficult, when in fact they are simply standing at another door.</p>
<p>Becoming aware of our preference allows us to pause. Instead of defending our own style, we can ask: What is the invitation they are offering me through their language and behaviour? Which door are they holding open that I have overlooked because I was guarding my own?</p>
<p>Influence begins with this act of humility. The willingness to see that the door we most trust may not be the one others are waiting at.</p>
<p>Once we recognise our blind spot, we are ready to notice the variety of doors available to us. Influence is not one way, it is five ways. Each has its own language, its own gifts, and its own risks. Rationalising, Asserting, Negotiating, Inspiring, and Bridging are not personality types but choices. At any moment, we can choose to knock on a different door, depending on where others are standing and what the moment requires.</p>
<p>What follows is a closer look at each door. how to recognise it, how to walk through it well, and how to avoid turning it into a wall.</p>
<h2>Rationalising: The door of logic</h2>
<p>Rationalising is the style that seeks to persuade through facts, evidence, and analysis. It appeals to those who are comforted by structure and clarity. When someone asks for data, compares benchmarks, or worries about risk and performance, they are standing at the rational door.</p>
<p>This style has its strengths. It reassures the finance director who needs a business case. It appeals to the engineer who wants proof that the system will not fail. It builds trust with the analyst who measures quality by what can be verified.</p>
<p>To enter this door well, we come prepared. We gather our facts. We organise our thinking into a clear flow: problem, options, evidence, recommendation. We know the return on investment, the efficiency gains, the quality improvements. We anticipate objections and hold evidence ready to meet them. We present data not as a weapon but as a gift of clarity.</p>
<p>Yet logic alone is not enough. Overused, it can become cold and detached. The person across from us may long for empathy, but we bury them in numbers. They may seek relationship, but we offer them a chart. Rationalising can easily turn into proving a point rather than creating understanding.</p>
<h3>Reflection questions</h3>
<p>&nbsp;•	Which metrics or outcomes matter most to this person, and have I framed my case in those terms, for example ROI, risk, quality or efficiency?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	What is my one-page flow: problem, options, evidence, recommendation?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	Which objections are most likely, and what independent sources will I cite to address them?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	Where will a chart or comparison clarify, and where could visuals overwhelm?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	What level of evidence would be enough for this decision, and how will I check for overload signals in the moment?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	Where might I be using facts to prove a point rather than to build shared understanding?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	If they are not data-driven, which second door will I pivot to after I test for fit?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	What jargon should I remove to keep the message precise and clear?</p>
<h2>Asserting: The door of conviction</h2>
<p>Asserting persuades through confidence, authority, and clarity. It is the voice that speaks directly and without hesitation. It is the person who values decisiveness, who prefers a straight line over a winding explanation, who respects those who stand their ground.</p>
<p>You recognise this style when someone expresses strong opinions with little hesitation, when they challenge ideas and expect you to do the same, when they respond best to conviction rather than ambiguity. For them, clarity is a form of respect.</p>
<p>To enter this door well, we speak with confidence. We choose firm language, declarative statements, uncluttered by qualifiers. We are direct and concise. We know our boundaries, and we state them. We are ready with anchor points: two or three firm reasons why our proposal matters.</p>
<p>The temptation, though, is to confuse assertiveness with aggression. Overused, asserting becomes domineering. It silences others. It leaves no room for dialogue. It builds resistance where it meant to build respect.</p>
<h3>Reflection questions</h3>
<p>&nbsp;•	What exactly am I asking for in one clear sentence?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	What is non-negotiable, and what is flexible?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	What two or three anchor reasons will I use to support my position?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	How will I signal credibility without drifting into name-dropping or status plays?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	What does matching their energy look like while staying respectful and calm?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	Where will I deliberately pause to listen so I do not over-talk the room?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	What early signals tell me I am tipping into pressure, and how will I de-escalate?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	If directness stalls the dialogue, what is my next door to try?</p>
<h2>Negotiating: The door of balance</h2>
<p>Negotiating persuades by finding common ground. It seeks the middle path, the workable solution, the compromise that honours both sides. It is rooted in the belief that influence is not about victory but about mutual benefit.</p>
<p>You notice this style in those who raise concerns gently, who suggest meeting halfway, who speak in terms of “what if” and “could we.” They are pragmatic. They value win–win outcomes. They prefer flexibility over confrontation.</p>
<p>To enter this door well, we listen closely to uncover the real concern beneath the stated one. We protect what matters most to us while staying open to trade-offs. We come with options. We ask open-ended questions. We remain collaborative, treating the conversation as joint problem-solving.</p>
<p>But compromise has its dangers. Overused, negotiation turns into unnecessary concession. We may be seen as weak or uncertain. Others may begin every conversation expecting us to bend. We may give away value before fully exploring our own position.</p>
<h3>Reflection questions</h3>
<p>&nbsp;•	What is the real concern beneath what is being said, and how will I surface it with open questions?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	Which larger goals or principles am I protecting, and what are my red lines?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	What tradables or creative options can I offer that create value without giving away too much?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	What do I expect in return for each concession?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	How will I hold a respectful, collaborative tone so we stay in joint problem solving?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	At what point would compromise become drift, and how will I name that threshold?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	If others expect automatic concessions from me, how will I reset expectations early?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	What alternative door will I use if bargaining signals are not present?</p>
<h2>Inspiring: The door of vision</h2>
<p>Inspiring persuades through story, metaphor, and imagination. It calls people to something larger than themselves. It shifts the focus from what is practical to what is possible.</p>
<p>You know you are with an inspiring type when they disengage from technical talk but light up at mention of purpose or possibility. They ask about impact and legacy. They respond to stories and metaphors. They look for meaning, not just measurement.</p>
<p>To enter this door well, we tell relevant stories. We use vivid language and imagery. We connect ideas to values and aspirations. We speak with authenticity and passion. We invite others to imagine: What if you could? What would it feel like if…?</p>
<p>Yet inspiration without grounding can lose its way. Overused, it becomes idealistic, disconnected from reality, heavy with promise and light on delivery. Listeners may nod politely but ask for numbers that never come. Trust fades when vision is not matched by action.</p>
<h3>Reflection questions</h3>
<p>&nbsp;•	What specific story from their world will make this possibility feel real and credible?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	What image or analogy will help them visualise success?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	Which values or purpose of theirs does this idea serve, for example impact, legacy, innovation or customer experience?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	What is the smallest concrete next step that grounds the vision?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	Where will I invite imagination with a genuine what if question, then check for practical concerns?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	What numbers or proof points should I have ready if they ask for them?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	How will I keep my tone authentic so enthusiasm does not outpace deliverables?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	If inspiration lands politely but without commitment, which door will I move to next?</p>
<h2>Bridging: The door of relationship</h2>
<p>Bridging persuades through connection and social proof. It is the style that builds trust by involving others, by leaning on shared experience, by showing that someone else has walked this path before.</p>
<p>You recognise it when someone asks, “Who else is doing this?” or seems hesitant until they hear a peer’s endorsement. They value rapport and trust more than unknown data. They commit when they see others they respect committing.</p>
<p>To enter this door well, we bring in mutual contacts. We offer testimonials and case studies. We emphasise shared goals. We give before we ask, offering help, making introductions, extending reciprocity. We are warm and attentive, because this style rests on human connection.</p>
<p>But here too lies a danger. Overused, bridging makes us dependent on others. We may delay decisions, waiting for third-party validation. We may undermine our own authority, deferring to outside voices instead of speaking for ourselves.</p>
<h3>Reflection questions</h3>
<p>&nbsp;•	Who do they already trust that I can appropriately involve, and how will I make that connection?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	Which case study or testimonial best mirrors their context?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	How will I frame our shared goals so alignment is explicit?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	What value can I offer first, for example a helpful introduction or insight, before asking for commitment?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	How will I keep momentum without waiting for every third party to weigh in?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	Where do I need to speak in my own voice so I do not over-rely on others’ validation?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	What is my plan to sustain the relationship beyond this single decision?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	If bridging slows progress, which door should I try to regain decisiveness?</p>
<h2>Living the paradox of influence</h2>
<p>Each of these five doors, Rationalising, Asserting, Negotiating, Inspiring, and Bridging, offers a path into relationship. Each works best when it honours the person we hope to influence rather than serving only our own habits.</p>
<p>The paradox is that any of them, when overused, becomes a wall. Logic turns cold. Conviction turns harsh. Compromise turns weak. Vision turns empty. Relationship turns dependent. What begins as invitation can end as imposition.</p>
<p>The practice is not to abandon our natural style but to notice when it no longer serves. To ask: Which doorway is this person already standing at? What language are they using? What energises them? What shuts them down?</p>
<p>Influence then becomes less about pressing harder on the door we know, and more about walking around to the door they are holding open.</p>
<p>Persuasion is not about clever tactics or manipulation. It is about presence. It is about listening for what matters to others and choosing consciously how we invite them.</p>
<p>The question that remains for each of us is simple: Which door will you choose to knock on in your next conversation?</p>
<p><strong>Do you have any tips or advice? What has worked for you? Do you have any recommended resources to explore? Thanks for reading!</strong></p>

<h2>Influenced by</h2>
<p>The five doors of influence: Rationalising, Asserting, Negotiating, Inspiring, and Bridging, are my synthesis, but several bodies of work have shaped them:</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	Gary Yukl’s research on leadership influence tactics, which identified patterns such as rational persuasion, pressure, exchange, inspirational appeals, and coalition tactics.</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	Robert Cialdini’s principles of persuasion, especially authority, social proof, reciprocity, and consistency, which continue to show how people respond to influence in practice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	Negotiation practice and theory, from both organisational behaviour research and classic works on principled negotiation, which highlight the importance of mutual benefit and trade-offs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	Leadership and change literature, including Peter Block’s writings on community and invitation, which shape the idea of influence as a relational act rather than a manipulative one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	My own work with leadership teams, where repeated practice has confirmed that leaders tend to default to one or two styles, often without realising the limits this creates in how they see and respond to others.</p>
<p>These streams converge in the five doors. They are not meant as a new theory, but as a practical frame that leaders can hold in the moment, to choose how they wish to invite others.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>We formulate the task of detecting lines and paragraphs in a document into a unified two-level clustering problem. Given a set of text detection boxes that roughly correspond to words, a text line is a cluster of boxes and a paragraph is a cluster of lines. These clusters form a two-level tree that represents a major part of the layout of a document. We use a graph convolutional network to predict the relations between text detection boxes and then build both levels of clusters from these predictions. Experimentally, we demonstrate that the unified approach can be highly efficient while still achieving state-of-the-art quality for detecting paragraphs in public benchmarks and real-world images.

              <p>The latest nightly releases of Mojo (and our next stable release) include initial support for a new accelerator architecture: Apple Silicon GPUs!</p>
<p>We know that one of the biggest barriers to programming GPUs is access to hardware. It’s our hope that by making it possible to use Mojo to develop for a GPU present in every modern Mac, we can further democratize developing GPU-accelerated algorithms and AI models. This should also enable new paths of local-to-cloud development for AI models and more.</p>
<p>To get started, you need to have an Apple Silicon Mac (we support all M1 - M4 series chips) running macOS 15 or newer, with Xcode 16 or newer installed. The version of the Metal Shading Language we use (3.2, AIR bitcode version 2.7.0) needs the macOS 15 SDK, and you’ll get an error about incompatible bitcode versions if you run on an older macOS or use an older version of Xcode that doesn’t have the macOS 15 SDK.</p>
<p>You can clone our <a href="https://github.com/modular/modular"><code>modular</code></a> repository and try out one of our GPU function examples in the <code>examples/mojo/gpu-functions</code> directory. All but the <code>reduction.mojo</code> example should work on Apple Silicon GPUs today in the latest nightlies. Additionally, puzzles 1-15 of the <a href="https://puzzles.modular.com/introduction.html">Mojo GPU puzzles</a> should now work on Apple Silicon GPUs with the latest nightly. We haven’t yet updated the Pixi environment for the GPU puzzles to add Apple Silicon support, so for now you may need to run the Mojo code manually from another environment.</p>
<h2><a name="p-5775-current-capabilities-1" href="#p-5775-current-capabilities-1"></a>Current capabilities</h2>
<p>This is just the beginning of our support for Apple Silicon GPUs, and many pieces of functionality still need to be built out. Known features that don’t work today include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Intrinsics for many hardware capabilities
<ul>
<li>Not all Mojo GPU examples work, such as <code>reduction.mojo</code> and the more complex matrix multiplication examples</li>
<li>GPU puzzles 16 and above need more advanced hardware features</li>

<li>Basic MAX graphs</li>
<li>MAX custom ops</li>

<li>Serving AI models</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ll emphasize that even simple MAX graphs, and by extension AI models, don’t yet run on Apple Silicon GPUs. In our Python APIs, <code>accelerator_count()</code> will still return 0 until we have basic MAX graph support enabled. Hopefully, that won’t be long.</p>
<h2><a name="p-5775-next-steps-2" href="#p-5775-next-steps-2"></a>Next steps</h2>
<p>We’ve identified many of the technical blockers to progressively enable the above. The current list of what we plan to work on includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Handle <code>MAX_THREADS_PER_BLOCK_METADATA</code> and similar aliases</li>
<li>Support <code>GridDim</code>, <code>lane_id</code></li>
<li>Enable <code>async_copy_*</code></li>
<li>Convert arguments of an array type to a pointer type</li>
<li>Support <code>bfloat16</code> on ARM devices</li>
<li>Support <code>SubBuffer</code></li>
<li>Enable atomic operations</li>
<li>Complete implementation of <code>MetalDeviceContext::synchronize</code></li>
<li>Enable captured arguments</li>
<li>Support <code>print</code> and <code>debug_assert</code></li>
</ul>
<p>I apologize for some of the cryptic error messages you may get when hitting a piece of missing functionality, or encountering a system configuration we aren’t yet compatible with. We hope to improve the messaging over time, and to provide better guides for debugging failures.</p>
<h2><a name="p-5775-how-this-works-3" href="#p-5775-how-this-works-3"></a>How this works</h2>
<p>To learn more about how Mojo code is compiled to target Apple Silicon GPUs, check out <a href="https://youtu.be/t2hAfgDYHoc?si=5X7E70xAi_eMjCMN&amp;t=1557">Amir Nassereldine’s detailed technical presentation from our recent Modular Community Meeting</a>. He did amazing work in establishing the fundamentals during his summer internship, and we are now building on that to advance Mojo on this new architecture.</p>
<p>In brief, a multi-step process is used to compile and run Mojo code on an Apple Silicon GPU. First, we compile Mojo GPU functions to Apple Intermediate Representation (AIR) bitcode. This is done through lowering to LLVM IR, and then specifically converting to Metal-compatible AIR.</p>
<p>Mojo handles interactions with an accelerator through the <code>DeviceContext</code> type. In the case of Apple Silicon GPUs, we’ve specialized this into a<code>MetalDeviceContext</code> that handles the next stages in compilation and execution.</p>
<p>The <code>MetalDeviceContext</code> uses the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/metal/cpp/">Metal-cpp API</a> to compile the AIR representation into a <code>.metallib</code> for execution on device. Once the <code>.metallib</code> is ready, the <code>MetalDeviceContext</code> manages a Metal <code>CommandQueue</code>, and buffers operations for moving data, running a GPU function, and more. All of this happens behind-the-scenes and a Mojo developer doesn’t need to worry about any of it.</p>
<p>Code that you’ve written to run on an NVIDIA or AMD GPUs should mostly just work on an Apple Silicon GPU, assuming no device-specific features were being used. Obviously, different patterns will be required to get the most performance out of each GPU, and we’re excited to explore this new optimization space on Apple Silicon GPUs with you.</p>
<h2><a name="p-5775-just-the-beginning-4" href="#p-5775-just-the-beginning-4"></a>Just the beginning</h2>
<p>While we’d love help in bringing up Apple Silicon GPU support, some of the infrastructure for introducing support for new AIR intrinsics and compiling them to a <code>.metallib</code> currently requires Modular developers for implementation. We’ll get more of the basics in place before work moves primarily to the open-source standard library and kernels, at which point community members will be able to do a lot more to advance compatibility. Contributions are always welcome, but we don’t want you to hit missing non-public components and get frustrated by being unable to move forward.</p>
<p>We’ll share much more documentation and content on how to work with and optimize for this new hardware family, but we’re extremely excited about even these first few steps onto Apple Silicon GPUs. I’ll to try to keep this post up to date as we expand functionality.</p>

            <p>Our Docker containers largely use Linux within them. Due to the requirement for Xcode tooling to build the <code>.metallib</code> from Mojo code, you’d need to have a virtualized macOS environment in the container. We haven’t yet built a container like that.</p>

            <p>Googling / AI Overlording around it looks like you can’t even mount the gpu from mac into a container anyways. Unless someone knows something I don’t, I’m guessing the guidance on mojo + metal is via host.</p>

   <p>SACRAMENTO, Calif — California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a law banning law enforcement from wearing masks on duty except for things like riot gear, medical masks and undercover work.</p>   <p>Saying it's the first bill of its type in the country, Newsom — a Democrat and frequent critic of President Trump — said it was a sign of growing authoritarianism to have detentions in by masked men "hidden from accountability, any transparency, any oversight. That's Trump's America."</p>   <p>He said federal agents had operated for years in the state unmasked and called masking "a new construct conceived to terrorize our diverse communities." </p>   
   <p>The law, called by sponsors the "<a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202520260SB627" target="_blank"><u>No Secret Police Act</u></a>," comes in response to increased immigration enforcement in California, particularly in Los Angeles. Newsom went to L.A. for the bill signing.</p>   <p>President Trump's mass deportation program has led to scenes of masked federal agents detaining people off the streets, often without badges or indicating what agency they're from. The city has been the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/06/09/nx-s1-5427176/the-latest-on-the-la-protests-sparked-by-immigration-sweeps" target="_blank">scene of protests</a> against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids.</p>   <h3 id="The">The impact of the law could be decided in court</h3>   <p>The law takes effect next year. It's unclear exactly what powers state lawmakers have to regulate the conduct of federal law enforcement. University of California, Davis law professor Raquel Aldana says California is trying to use this law to identify what federal agents can and cannot do within a state.</p>   <p>She said there has to be a line somewhere for states outlawing — as hypothetical extremes — things like murder or torture by federal agents. "At some point, the answer has to be 'no' and I think this is what the state of California is trying to do. Establish limits as to how much the federal government can do within the jurisdiction of the state. It's an issue of state sovereignty."</p>   
   <p>Lawmakers in a few other states, including New York and Massachusetts, are considering similar moves.</p>   <p>ICE declined to comment when contacted by NPR. In general, ICE officials have said their agents wear masks to prevent from being identified in videos or photos posted online, sometimes resulting in threats to them or their families.</p>   <p>Newsom also signed several other bills including one that would require law enforcement to clearly display their name or badge number while on duty; another requiring schools to notify parents and staff when immigration enforcement is on site; and two others prohibiting schools and health care facilities from allowing ICE agents on their grounds without valid warrants.</p>   <p>Aldana noted that the legal impact of the mask law on federal law enforcement could be weakened because it does not apply to California state-level law enforcement.</p>   <p>But it does apply to police and sheriffs offices and other local agencies, who routinely operate unmasked. By July 2026, their agencies have to issue mask policies following the law.</p>   <h3 id="California">California law enforcement groups have opposed it</h3>   <p>Several California organizations representing local law enforcement agencies, including the California State Sheriff's Association, opposed the bill, calling it reckless and dangerous to officers and their families.</p>   <p>Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco, a Republican running in the 2026 race for governor, said the ban showed Newsom and Democratic lawmakers care more about the safety of criminals than officers.</p>   <p>"They didn't ban criminals from wearing masks, they didn't tell criminals that they had to identify themselves," Bianco said while campaigning in Northern California on Friday. "Every single person that voted for that needs to be eliminated in the next election. Anyone that votes for those people are absolute idiots."</p>   <p>The Peace Officers Research Association of California — representing over 80,000 public safety members — and the California Police Chiefs Association were also against the bill.</p>   
   <p>Giselle Garcia with NorCal Resist, a Sacramento-based mutual aid organization that provides legal assistance to immigrants at risk of deportation, said the ban would be helpful even if it's not enforceable.</p>   <p>"There's always a tension between state rights versus the federal government's rights and scope of power," Garcia said. "However, what we do know is that when things are codified under law, there is more of an opportunity to not just cite to law, but hopefully there's some kind of basis for litigation to really challenge when there's a federal government abuse happening."</p>   <p>Garcia said the organization's court observers have been verbally harassed and physically assaulted by ICE agents wearing masks who refuse to identify themselves when asked.</p>      <p><a href="https://www.capradio.org/about/bios/gerardo-zavala/" target="_blank"><em>Gerardo Zavala</em></a><em> covers state government and politics for Capradio.</em></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-id="4189490c" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="theme-post-content.default">
					<p>LaLiga, Spain’s top football league, is facing a firestorm of criticism after boasting about a staggering 142% increase in anti-piracy takedown notices in early 2025 while simultaneously causing <a href="https://reclaimthenet.org/laliga-seeks-charges-against-google-and-apple-execs-for-not-remotely-removing-apps-from-peoples-phones">extensive collateral damage across the internet</a>.</p>
<p>As the 2025/2026 season began on August 15, LaLiga ramped up its enforcement strategy, triggering widespread outages for entirely lawful websites, services, and platforms.</p>
<p>These disruptions are tied to a controversial anti-piracy scheme operated in partnership with telecom giant Telefónica.</p>
<p>The initiative, which enjoys judicial backing in Spain, allows LaLiga to instruct major internet service providers, including Movistar, Vodafone, Orange, and DIGI, to block IP addresses suspected of hosting unauthorized streams.</p>
<p>The fallout is that entire chunks of the internet go dark for Spanish users, often during match broadcasts.</p>
<p>LaLiga doesn’t target specific infringing content. Instead, it flags entire IP ranges, many of which are shared by thousands of unrelated domains.</p>
<p>When one site is accused of hosting pirated material, everyone else sharing that IP address gets swept up in the block.</p>
<p>The result is a digital dragnet that has ensnared companies as diverse as Amazon, Cloudflare, GitHub, Twitch, and even Google Fonts.</p>
<p><a href="https://torrentfreak.com/end-game-twitch-servers-among-hundreds-blocked-for-piracy-by-spanish-isps-250504/">TorrentFreak</a> has documented repeated weekly blocks of platforms <a href="https://reclaimthenet.org/laliga-spain-internet-censorship-vercel-blocking-piracy-shield">like Vercel since early 2025</a>, while Catalonia’s own .cat domain registry has also reported service disruptions.</p>
<p>The issue became so disruptive that iXsystems, the team behind TrueNAS, a widely used open-source NAS operating system, was forced to shift its distribution model entirely. After its CDN IPs were repeatedly blocked in Spain, making critical security updates inaccessible to users, the developers resorted to distributing their software via BitTorrent.</p>
<p>“These locks have a significant collateral damage about legitimate services, which have nothing to do with football piracy,” TrueNAS noted. Their solution not only bypasses censorship but hands the bandwidth burden back to the same ISPs complicit in the blocking.</p>
<p>In TrueNAS’s official community forums, users from Spain, Italy, and France reported ongoing issues with downloads and connectivity.</p>
<p>Some turned to VPNs to circumvent the blocks, though even popular providers like Cloudflare’s free WARP service were reportedly blocked during peak match times.</p>
<p>LaLiga, meanwhile, continues to tout its enforcement record. A self-published report revealed that over 26 million takedown notices were sent in the first half of 2025 alone, more than doubling the total from all of 2024.</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://reclaimthenet.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/A9zZxeOZndng.jpg" alt="Screenshot of a translated tweet from LaLiga reporting anti‑piracy results: it says detection of piracy in live sports reached historic numbers, a 142% increase in notifications to digital intermediaries in the first half of 2025 versus all of 2024, and a 60% reduction in piracy in the 24/25 season, above a coral‑bordered white graphic that reads NOTA INFORMATIVA and LALIGA." width="884" height="952" srcset="https://reclaimthenet.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/A9zZxeOZndng.jpg 884w, https://reclaimthenet.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/A9zZxeOZndng-279x300.jpg 279w, https://reclaimthenet.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/A9zZxeOZndng-768x827.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 884px) 100vw, 884px"></p>
<p>Yet despite this surge, only 11% of flagged streams were actually taken offline. LaLiga’s primary targets include hosting services and infrastructure providers, where enforcement remains minimal.</p>
<p>Legal challenges to the league’s blocking strategy are piling up. Cloudflare and RootedCON have taken their grievances to Spain’s Constitutional Court after lower courts refused to curb the overreach.</p>
<p>Despite mounting pressure, there is no indication that the blanket blocking will stop. On the contrary, as the new season unfolds, users are bracing for more censorship.</p>
<p>Calls for reform are growing louder. Opponents of the regime argue that the current system punishes lawful users while failing to meaningfully curb piracy.</p>
<p>As long as courts uphold LaLiga’s authority to dictate who gets to be online during football games, entire swaths of the internet will remain at risk, collateral in a campaign that blurs the line between protection and overreach.</p>
<p>The reality is clear. LaLiga’s war on piracy has become a war on the open web.</p>

<p>The University of Oxford has fallen out of the top three universities in the UK for the first time, according to <a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk-university-rankings/feature-guide/article/best-good-university-guide-2026-nlg69hm5k" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>The Times and The Sunday Times Good University Guide for 2026</strong></a>.</p>



<p>Both Oxford and Cambridge universities have been supplanted by Durham University, which now holds the third-place spot among the top universities in the UK.</p>



<p>Oxford and Cambridge are tied for fourth in the 2026 rankings, after falling due to their relatively poor performance in the latest National Student Survey.</p>



<p>Durham University was named The Times’s University of the Year, although the number-one ranked university in the UK remained the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) for the second year in a row.</p>



<p>Second place was held by the University of St Andrews, again for the second consecutive year.</p>



<p>While the University of St Andrews ranked very highly in student experience and teaching quality, it lost out to the LSE in graduate prospects and research quality.</p>



<p>Durham University improved by 30 places year-on-year in its students’ evaluation of teaching quality, which was the main driver in securing its third place in the overall university league table.</p>



<p>“Durham is an outstanding place to study. We ensure that every student can grow and thrive here,” said Durham University Vice-Chancellor Professor Karen O’Brien.</p>



<p>“Our loyal, engaged alumni are testament to the impressive career prospects that await our graduates.”</p>



<p>The table below shows the top 20 universities in the United Kingdom, according to The Times University Rankings 2026.</p>
