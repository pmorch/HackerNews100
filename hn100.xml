Nearly&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.legaldive.com/news/generative-ai-legal-use-cases-wolters-kluwer-report/700342/"><span>three quarters of lawyers</span></a><span> plan on using generative AI for their work, from sifting through mountains of case law to drafting contracts to reviewing documents to writing legal memoranda. But are these tools reliable enough for real-world use?</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Large language models have a documented tendency to “hallucinate,” or make up false information. In one highly-publicized case, a New York lawyer&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/27/nyregion/avianca-airline-lawsuit-chatgpt.html"><span>faced sanctions</span></a><span> for citing ChatGPT-invented fictional cases in a legal brief;&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/29/nyregion/michael-cohen-ai-fake-cases.html"><span>many similar cases</span></a><span> have since been reported. And our&nbsp;</span><a href="https://hai.stanford.edu/news/hallucinating-law-legal-mistakes-large-language-models-are-pervasive"><span>previous study</span></a><span> of general-purpose chatbots found that they hallucinated between 58% and 82% of the time on legal queries, highlighting the risks of incorporating AI into legal practice. In his&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/publicinfo/year-end/2023year-endreport.pdf"><span>2023 annual report on the judiciary</span></a><span>, Chief Justice Roberts took note and warned lawyers of hallucinations.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Across all areas of industry, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is seen and promoted as the solution for reducing hallucinations in domain-specific contexts. Relying on RAG, leading legal research services have released AI-powered legal research products that they claim&nbsp;</span><a href="https://legal.thomsonreuters.com/blog/legal-research-meets-generative-ai/"><span>“avoid”</span></a><span> hallucinations and guarantee&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.lexisnexis.com/community/pressroom/b/news/posts/lexisnexis-launches-lexis-ai-a-generative-ai-solution-with-hallucination-free-linked-legal-citations"><span>“hallucination-free”</span></a><span> legal citations. RAG systems promise to deliver more accurate and trustworthy legal information by integrating a language model with a database of legal documents. Yet providers have not provided hard evidence for such claims or even precisely defined “hallucination,” making it difficult to assess their real-world reliability.</span></p><h2>AI-Driven Legal Research Tools Still Hallucinate</h2><p dir="ltr"><span>In a new&nbsp;</span><a href="https://dho.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/Legal_RAG_Hallucinations.pdf"><span>preprint study</span></a><span> by&nbsp;</span><a href="https://reglab.stanford.edu/"><span>Stanford RegLab</span></a><span> and&nbsp;</span><a href="https://hai.stanford.edu/"><span>HAI</span></a><span> researchers, we put the claims of two providers, LexisNexis (creator of Lexis+ AI) and Thomson Reuters (creator of Westlaw AI-Assisted Research and Ask Practical Law AI)), to the test. We show that their tools do reduce errors compared to general-purpose AI models like GPT-4. That is a substantial improvement and we document instances where these tools provide sound and detailed legal research. But even these bespoke legal AI tools still hallucinate an alarming amount of the time: the Lexis+ AI and Ask Practical Law AI systems produced incorrect information more than 17% of the time, while Westlaw’s AI-Assisted Research hallucinated more than 34% of the time.</span></p><blockquote><p dir="ltr"><span>Read the full study, </span><a href="https://dho.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/Legal_RAG_Hallucinations.pdf"><span>Hallucination-Free? Assessing the Reliability of Leading AI Legal Research Tools</span></a></p></blockquote><p dir="ltr"><span>To conduct our study, we manually constructed a pre-registered dataset of over 200 open-ended legal queries, which we designed to probe various aspects of these systems’ performance.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Broadly, we investigated (1) general research questions (questions about doctrine, case holdings, or the bar exam); (2) jurisdiction or time-specific questions (questions about circuit splits and recent changes in the law); (3) false premise questions (questions that mimic a user having a mistaken understanding of the law); and (4) factual recall questions (questions about simple, objective facts that require no legal interpretation). These questions are designed to reflect a wide range of query types and to constitute a challenging real-world dataset of exactly the kinds of queries where legal research may be needed the most.</span></p><p><img src="https://hai.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/inline-images/Hallucinations%201.png" data-entity-uuid="404ddaba-fd25-4ed2-a086-56fa9e67ddbc" data-entity-type="file" alt="comparison of hallucinated and incomplete responses" width="1328" height="1002" loading="lazy"></p><p dir="ltr"><em><strong>Figure 1:</strong><span> Comparison of hallucinated (red) and incomplete (yellow) answers across generative legal research tools.</span></em></p><p dir="ltr"><span>These systems can hallucinate in one of two ways. First, a response from an AI tool might just be&nbsp;</span><em>incorrect</em><span>—it describes the law incorrectly or makes a factual error. Second, a response might be&nbsp;</span><em>misgrounded</em><span>—the AI tool describes the law correctly, but cites a source which does not in fact support its claims.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Given the critical importance of authoritative sources in legal research and writing, the second type of hallucination may be even more pernicious than the outright invention of legal cases. A citation might be “hallucination-free” in the narrowest sense that the citation&nbsp;</span><em>exists</em><span>, but that is not the only thing that matters. The core promise of legal AI is that it can streamline the time-consuming process of identifying relevant legal sources. If a tool provides sources that&nbsp;</span><em>seem</em><span> authoritative but are in reality irrelevant or contradictory, users could be misled. They may place undue trust in the tool's output, potentially leading to erroneous legal judgments and conclusions.</span></p><p><img src="https://hai.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/inline-images/Hallucinations%202.png" data-entity-uuid="25e872e0-43c2-4c6b-965c-ad3dfd264ef2" data-entity-type="file" alt="examples of hallucinations from models" width="1600" height="927" loading="lazy"></p><p dir="ltr"><em><strong>Figure 2:&nbsp;</strong><span>Top left: Example of a hallucinated response by Westlaw's AI-Assisted Research product. The system makes up a statement in the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure that does not exist (and Kontrick v. Ryan, 540 U.S. 443 (2004) held that a closely related bankruptcy deadline provision was not jurisdictional).&nbsp;Top right: Example of a hallucinated response by LexisNexis's Lexis+ AI.

Given a user query (left), the typical process consists of two steps: (1) retrieval (middle), where the query is embedded with natural language processing and a retrieval system takes embeddings and retrieves the relevant documents (e.g., Supreme Court cases); and (2) generation (right), where the retrieved texts are fed to the language model to generate the response to the user query. Any of the subsidiary steps may introduce error and hallucinations into the generated response. (Icons are courtesy of FlatIcon.)</em></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Under the hood, these new legal AI tools use retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to produce their results, a method that many tout as a potential solution to the hallucination problem. In theory, RAG allows a system to first&nbsp;</span><em>retrieve</em><span> the relevant source material and then use it to&nbsp;</span><em>generate</em><span> the correct response. In practice, however, we show that even RAG systems are not hallucination-free.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>We identify several challenges that are particularly unique to RAG-based legal AI systems, causing hallucinations.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>First, legal retrieval is hard. As any lawyer knows, finding the appropriate (or best) authority can be no easy task. Unlike other domains, the law is not entirely composed of verifiable&nbsp;</span><em>facts</em><span>—instead, law is built up over time by judges writing&nbsp;</span><em>opinions</em><span>. This makes identifying the set of documents that definitively answer a query difficult, and sometimes hallucinations occur for the simple reason that the system’s retrieval mechanism fails.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Second, even when retrieval occurs, the document that is retrieved can be an inapplicable authority. In the American legal system, rules and precedents differ across jurisdictions and time periods; documents that might be relevant on their face due to semantic similarity to a query may actually be inapposite for idiosyncratic reasons that are unique to the law. Thus, we also observe hallucinations occurring when these RAG systems fail to identify the truly binding authority. This is particularly problematic as areas where the law is in flux is precisely where legal research matters the most. One system, for instance, incorrectly recited the “undue burden” standard for abortion restrictions as good law, which was overturned in&nbsp;</span><em>Dobbs</em><span> (see Figure 2).&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Third, sycophancy—the tendency of AI to agree with the user's incorrect assumptions—also poses unique risks in legal settings. One system, for instance, naively agreed with the question’s premise that Justice Ginsburg dissented in&nbsp;</span><em>Obergefell</em><span>, the case establishing a right to same-sex marriage, and answered that she did so based on her views on international copyright. (Justice Ginsburg did not dissent in&nbsp;</span><em>Obergefell</em><span> and, no, the case had nothing to do with copyright.) Notwithstanding that answer, here there are optimistic results. Our tests showed that both systems generally navigated queries based on false premises effectively. But when these systems do agree with erroneous user assertions, the implications can be severe—particularly for those hoping to use these tools to increase access to justice among&nbsp;</span><em>pro se</em><span> and under-resourced litigants.</span></p><h2>Responsible Integration of AI Into Law Requires Transparency</h2><p dir="ltr"><span>Ultimately, our results highlight the need for rigorous and transparent benchmarking of legal AI tools. Unlike other domains, the use of AI in law remains alarmingly opaque: the tools we study provide no systematic access, publish few details about their models, and report no evaluation results at all.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>This opacity makes it exceedingly challenging for lawyers to procure and acquire AI products. The large law firm&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.bloomberglaw.com/product/blaw/bloomberglawnews/business-and-practice/BNA%200000018f-1b15-dda8-a78f-1f75a0570001"><span>Paul Weiss</span></a><span> spent nearly a year and a half testing a product, and did not develop “hard metrics” because checking the AI system was so involved that it “makes any efficiency gains difficult to measure.” The absence of rigorous evaluation metrics makes responsible adoption difficult, especially for practitioners that are less resourced than Paul Weiss.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>The lack of transparency also threatens lawyers’ ability to comply with ethical and professional responsibility requirements. The bar associations of&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.calbar.ca.gov/Portals/0/documents/ethics/Generative-AI-Practical-Guidance.pdf"><span>California</span></a><span>,&nbsp;</span><a href="https://nysba.org/app/uploads/2024/04/Task-Force-on-AI-Report-draft-2024-04-02-FINAL.pdf"><span>New York</span></a><span>, and&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.floridabar.org/etopinions/opinion-24-1/"><span>Florida</span></a><span> have all recently released guidance on lawyers’ duty of supervision over work products created with AI tools. And as of May 2024,&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.law360.com/pulse/ai-tracker"><span>more than 25 federal judges</span></a><span> have issued standing orders instructing attorneys to disclose or monitor the use of AI in their courtrooms.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Without access to evaluations of the specific tools and transparency around their design, lawyers may find it impossible to comply with these responsibilities. Alternatively, given the high rate of hallucinations, lawyers may find themselves having to verify each and every proposition and citation provided by these tools, undercutting the stated efficiency gains that legal AI tools are supposed to provide.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Our study is meant in no way to single out LexisNexis and Thomson Reuters. Their products are far from the only legal AI tools that stand in need of transparency—a slew of startups offer similar products and have&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.midpage.ai/ChatGPT-plugin"><span>made</span></a><span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://vlex.com/products/vincent-ai"><span>similar</span></a><span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.paxton.ai/post/paxton-ai-has-raised-6m-to-power-fast-highly-accurate-legal-research-and-drafting-using-ai"><span>claims</span></a><span>, but they are available on even more restricted bases, making it even more difficult to assess how they function.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Based on what we know, legal hallucinations have not been solved.The legal profession should turn to public benchmarking and rigorous evaluations of AI tools.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><em>This story was updated on Thursday, May 30, 2024, to include analysis of a third AI tool, Westlaw’s AI-Assisted Research.</em></p><p dir="ltr"><em>Paper authors: Varun Magesh is a research fellow at Stanford RegLab.

<p>How do you transfer files off an Apple laptop from 1994? It's harder than it sounds!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.unterminated.com/images/random-fun/how-to-copy-a-file-from-a-30-year-old-laptop/DSC_230304-165126_size_original.jpg" title="" width="1024" height="680"><img src="https://www.unterminated.com/images/random-fun/how-to-copy-a-file-from-a-30-year-old-laptop/DSC_230304-165126_size.jpg" alt="" title="Close-up of PowerBook Duo 280c laptop" width="1024" height="680"></a></p>

<h3>Between a dock and a hard place</h3>

<p>A family member presented me with an interesting problem: a PowerBook Duo 280c laptop from 1994 containing a few short audio recordings he wanted to preserve. A quick analysis of the problem at hand revealed a couple things working in our favor:</p>

<ul>
<li>The laptop still boots... after a few gentle taps on the hard drive to get it to spin up!</li>
<li>The audio files play back locally through the laptop's internal speakers.</li>
</ul>

<p>On the other hand:</p>

<ul>
<li>The laptop has no audio jacks, so we couldn't get good analog copies of the recordings even if we wanted to.</li>
<li>The internal hard drive uses SCSI with an unusual connector. Adapting it didn't seem straightforward, and we weren't confident the old file system (HFS) would be easy to read from a modern system.</li>
<li>An external floppy drive accompanied the laptop... but the computer would not run with it connected. We couldn't figure out the hardware fault causing this.</li>
<li>The laptop has an AppleTalk port and a phone jack... but no networking software installed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Remember, it comes from a time before the Internet was mainstream. HTTP, the protocol underpinning the modern Internet, wasn't finalized until 1996. Software for connecting to a dial-up provider would have been available at the time, but was never installed. However, the laptop does have a phone dialer application, which gave us our first clue towards a potential solution.</p>

<h3>Deus fax machina</h3>

<p>While the laptop has no networking software, it does have <em>fax</em> software. We confirmed the modem could dial, so this might just be crazy enough to work.</p>

<p>The first question was how to turn the audio file into something faxable. The laptop contains a collection of games. Alongside them is a resource editor, called ResEdit, which had previously been used to inspect and modify the aforementioned games. Let's see what it can do.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.unterminated.com/images/random-fun/how-to-copy-a-file-from-a-30-year-old-laptop/DSC_230304-151605_size_original.jpg" title="" width="1024" height="680"><img src="https://www.unterminated.com/images/random-fun/how-to-copy-a-file-from-a-30-year-old-laptop/DSC_230304-151605_size.jpg" alt="" title="The games folder contained a collection of games in addition to a resource editor" width="1024" height="680"></a></p>

<p>ResEdit has probably the most adorable splash screen ever.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.unterminated.com/images/random-fun/how-to-copy-a-file-from-a-30-year-old-laptop/ResEdit_animated.gif" title="ResEdit splash screen" width="1024" height="680"><img src="https://www.unterminated.com/images/random-fun/how-to-copy-a-file-from-a-30-year-old-laptop/ResEdit_animated.gif" alt="" title="ResEdit splash screen" width="1024" height="680"></a></p>

<p>Luckily, it includes a hex editor which allows you to view the raw contents of files in hexadecimal form. This is exactly what we need! Although, since ResEdit doesn't support printing, we'll have to copy the text into a different application that does.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.unterminated.com/images/random-fun/how-to-copy-a-file-from-a-30-year-old-laptop/DSC_230304-151716_size_original.jpg" title="" width="1024" height="680"><img src="https://www.unterminated.com/images/random-fun/how-to-copy-a-file-from-a-30-year-old-laptop/DSC_230304-151716_size.jpg" alt="" title="The contents of the sound file are selected in the hex editor" width="1024" height="680"></a></p>

<p>This particular sound file is 37,928 bytes long. The hexadecimal representation is double that, since each byte is represented by two characters (0-F).</p>

<p><a href="https://www.unterminated.com/images/random-fun/how-to-copy-a-file-from-a-30-year-old-laptop/DSC_230304-151722_size_original.jpg" title="" width="1024" height="680"><img src="https://www.unterminated.com/images/random-fun/how-to-copy-a-file-from-a-30-year-old-laptop/DSC_230304-151722_size.jpg" alt="" title="An error message says, &quot;Can't cut or copy more than 32000 characters at one time.&quot;" width="1024" height="680"></a></p>

<p>Huh. I guess we'll have to do it piecemeal. (And yes, that message literally means 32000, not 32767. Some programmer must have really liked base-10 numbers and signed shorts.) We'll use batches of 12288 (0x3000 in hex) to make the offsets easier to remember.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.unterminated.com/images/random-fun/how-to-copy-a-file-from-a-30-year-old-laptop/DSC_230304-152059_size_original.jpg" title="" width="1024" height="680"><img src="https://www.unterminated.com/images/random-fun/how-to-copy-a-file-from-a-30-year-old-laptop/DSC_230304-152059_size.jpg" alt="" title="Less of the document is selected in the hex editor, to stay within the 32,000 character limit" width="1024" height="680"></a></p>

<p>Now that we have a chunk of the document in the clipboard, what do we do with it? Thankfully, Microsoft Office is also installed on this laptop, and it supports printing!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.unterminated.com/images/random-fun/how-to-copy-a-file-from-a-30-year-old-laptop/DSC_230304-152119_size_original.jpg" title="" width="1024" height="680"><img src="https://www.unterminated.com/images/random-fun/how-to-copy-a-file-from-a-30-year-old-laptop/DSC_230304-152119_size.jpg" alt="" title="Microsoft Word 5.1a in the applications folder" width="1024" height="680"></a></p>

<p>Pasting the contents of the clipboard into a Word document inserts the hexadecimal representation verbatim.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.unterminated.com/images/random-fun/how-to-copy-a-file-from-a-30-year-old-laptop/DSC_230304-152256_size_original.jpg" title="" width="1024" height="680"><img src="https://www.unterminated.com/images/random-fun/how-to-copy-a-file-from-a-30-year-old-laptop/DSC_230304-152256_size.jpg" alt="" title="Blocks of hexidecimal text are copied into Microsoft Word" width="1024" height="680"></a></p>

<p>These sound files are all under 100KB, so copying them into Word doesn't take long. I'd estimate the transfer speed of manually copying the contents from ResEdit into Word via the clipboard averages about 316 bytes/second.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.unterminated.com/images/random-fun/how-to-copy-a-file-from-a-30-year-old-laptop/DSC_230304-152449_size_original.jpg" title="" width="1024" height="680"><img src="https://www.unterminated.com/images/random-fun/how-to-copy-a-file-from-a-30-year-old-laptop/DSC_230304-152449_size.jpg" alt="" title="The remainder of the sound file's hexidecimal representation is copied into Word" width="1024" height="680"></a></p>

<p>With the whole file copied into a text document, we can leverage the previously-discovered fax software from the print dialog. But, who do we send the fax to?</p>

<h3>Fax is the new file copy</h3>

<p>My college laptop, a ThinkPad T60, is the only computer I still own with an internal dial-up modem. It's running Windows XP, which includes a fax application that can listen to the modem for incoming faxes and store them as multi-page TIF images.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.unterminated.com/images/random-fun/how-to-copy-a-file-from-a-30-year-old-laptop/DSC_230304-165154_size_original.jpg" title="" width="1024" height="680"><img src="https://www.unterminated.com/images/random-fun/how-to-copy-a-file-from-a-30-year-old-laptop/DSC_230304-165154_size.jpg" alt="" title="ThinkPad T60 with phone cable plugged in" width="1024" height="680"></a></p>

<p>There's a problem though. Simply plugging the two laptops together with a phone cable doesn't work. The PowerBook dials, but the ThinkPad doesn't answer. There is an "Ignore Dial Tone" option, but it makes no difference.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.unterminated.com/images/random-fun/how-to-copy-a-file-from-a-30-year-old-laptop/DSC_230304-153033_size_original.jpg" title="" width="1024" height="680"><img src="https://www.unterminated.com/images/random-fun/how-to-copy-a-file-from-a-30-year-old-laptop/DSC_230304-153033_size.jpg" alt="" title="Dialing options for the fax, showing the &quot;Ignore Dial Tone&quot; option checked" width="1024" height="680"></a></p>

<p>It turns out the voltage provided by an actual landline is important for the modem to function properly. Fortunately, a simple <a href="https://www.segasaturnshiro.com/guide-build-a-line-voltage-inducer/">phone line simulator circuit</a> can overcome this problem, and is very easy to build with some common electronic components and a 9V battery.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.unterminated.com/images/random-fun/how-to-copy-a-file-from-a-30-year-old-laptop/DSC_230304-164725_crop_size_original.jpg" title="" width="1024" height="682"><img src="https://www.unterminated.com/images/random-fun/how-to-copy-a-file-from-a-30-year-old-laptop/DSC_230304-164725_crop_size.jpg" alt="" title="Primitive phone line circuit simulator, assembled with a resistor, capacitor, and a 9V battery" width="1024" height="682"></a></p>

<p>It's crude, but effective! (Side note: WAGO lever nuts are super handy for all sorts of electrical projects.) This schematic shows the circuit diagram of the mess of wires above.</p>

<p>With the two laptops now connected via a simulated phone line, we attempt to fax the document again.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.unterminated.com/images/random-fun/how-to-copy-a-file-from-a-30-year-old-laptop/DSC_230304-153219_size_original.jpg" title="" width="1024" height="680"><img src="https://www.unterminated.com/images/random-fun/how-to-copy-a-file-from-a-30-year-old-laptop/DSC_230304-153219_size.jpg" alt="" title="An error message says I am not in compliance with FCC regulation 68.318.C3 because I did not include a cover page. Oops." width="1024" height="680"></a></p>

<p>Oops. The FCC says I need a cover page. Let's try to appease them.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.unterminated.com/images/random-fun/how-to-copy-a-file-from-a-30-year-old-laptop/CoverPage_edit_original.png" title="" width="864" height="375"><img src="https://www.unterminated.com/images/random-fun/how-to-copy-a-file-from-a-30-year-old-laptop/CoverPage_edit.png" alt="" title="Example cover page generated by the fax software" width="864" height="375"></a></p>

<p>There we go.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.unterminated.com/images/random-fun/how-to-copy-a-file-from-a-30-year-old-laptop/DSC_230304-153232_size_original.jpg" title="" width="1024" height="680"><img src="https://www.unterminated.com/images/random-fun/how-to-copy-a-file-from-a-30-year-old-laptop/DSC_230304-153232_size.jpg" alt="" title="Successfully started printing the fax" width="1024" height="680"></a></p>

<p>It's working! It takes a while for it to rasterize the fax pages. After that's done, it estimates the fax will take 24 minutes to send.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.unterminated.com/images/random-fun/how-to-copy-a-file-from-a-30-year-old-laptop/DSC_230304-153307_size_original.jpg" title="" width="1024" height="680"><img src="https://www.unterminated.com/images/random-fun/how-to-copy-a-file-from-a-30-year-old-laptop/DSC_230304-153307_size.jpg" alt="" title="Rasterization completed, it will take 24 minutes to fax all 20 pages" width="1024" height="680"></a></p>

<p>That's kind of long. What if we reduce the font size?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.unterminated.com/images/random-fun/how-to-copy-a-file-from-a-30-year-old-laptop/DSC_230304-153856_size_original.jpg" title="" width="1024" height="680"><img src="https://www.unterminated.com/images/random-fun/how-to-copy-a-file-from-a-30-year-old-laptop/DSC_230304-153856_size.jpg" alt="" title="With the font size reduced, it will take 7 minutes to fax 6 pages" width="1024" height="680"></a></p>

<p>Down to 6 pages in 7 minutes. Much better. It chugs along at 14400bps until the fax is fully received by the ThinkPad.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.unterminated.com/images/random-fun/how-to-copy-a-file-from-a-30-year-old-laptop/WindowsFaxComplete.png" title="Successfully received the fax on the Windows PC" width="314" height="394"><img src="https://www.unterminated.com/images/random-fun/how-to-copy-a-file-from-a-30-year-old-laptop/WindowsFaxComplete.png" alt="" title="Successfully received the fax on the Windows PC" width="314" height="394"></a></p>

<p>It worked! Now the last step is figuring out how to turn this image back into a binary file.</p>

<h3>The file transfer to end all file transfers</h3>

<p>My first idea is to convert the TIF to a PDF and use optical character recognition (OCR) to translate it back to text. These images seem like the ideal candidate for an OCR algorithm:</p>

<ul>
<li>The text is computer-generated, so it's perfectly aligned and consistent.</li>
<li>Only 16 different characters are used (0-9, A-F).</li>
<li>It uses Courier, an extremely common fixed-width font.</li>
</ul>

<p>After running the PDF run through an OCR process, the text is now selectable. I can copy it into a hex editor and save it as a binary file.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.unterminated.com/images/random-fun/how-to-copy-a-file-from-a-30-year-old-laptop/HexImage_OCR.png" title="PDF contains selectable text after performing OCR" width="500" height="114"><img src="https://www.unterminated.com/images/random-fun/how-to-copy-a-file-from-a-30-year-old-laptop/HexImage_OCR.png" alt="" title="PDF contains selectable text after performing OCR" width="500" height="114"></a></p>

<p>The resulting file's size is close to, but not exactly, what I expected. Nonetheless, I import it into Audacity which is able to deduce the audio format: unsigned 8-bit PCM, little-endian, 22050 Hz, mono. A waveform appears!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.unterminated.com/images/random-fun/how-to-copy-a-file-from-a-30-year-old-laptop/Waveform_Overview.png" title="A waveform of the audio as seen in Audacity" width="500" height="125"><img src="https://www.unterminated.com/images/random-fun/how-to-copy-a-file-from-a-30-year-old-laptop/Waveform_Overview.png" alt="" title="A waveform of the audio as seen in Audacity" width="500" height="125"></a></p>

<p>I play it back, and it sounds pretty good! Especially considering it was recorded from the internal microphone of a laptop from 1994. There's an audible problem though, and it's actually visible on the waveform itself. Zooming in reveals it more clearly.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.unterminated.com/images/random-fun/how-to-copy-a-file-from-a-30-year-old-laptop/Waveform_Closeup.png" title="Closeup of the waveform from the OCR'd data contains sporadic errors" width="500" height="125"><img src="https://www.unterminated.com/images/random-fun/how-to-copy-a-file-from-a-30-year-old-laptop/Waveform_Closeup.png" alt="" title="Closeup of the waveform from the OCR'd data contains sporadic errors" width="500" height="125"></a></p>

<p>All of those abrupt dips are the result of OCR transcription errors. They manifest as crackling or popping noises throughout the recording. I need a better way to convert this text to a file.</p>

<p>I try a bunch of different OCR programs, but can't find any that can transcribe the document with 100% accuracy. They often confuse certain letters or numbers (like 0 and C, 9 and 4, 0 and D). Sometimes they omit characters, sometimes they introduce new ones. I try different font sizes and different fonts, but it doesn't matter.</p>

<p>I need to process these files with perfect accuracy, and OCR software is not going to cut it. With no sign of improvement a couple dozen faxes later, I decide to write my own.</p>

<h3>The fax, the whole fax, and nothing but the fax</h3>

<p>Knowing that the text in these images is tightly structured, I can make a lot of assumptions when processing them. They were generated with a fixed-width font, which means the whole document is essentially an evenly-spaced grid of characters. Once I figure out the correct starting point, character offsets, and line spacing, I can capture and analyze each character individually.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.unterminated.com/images/random-fun/how-to-copy-a-file-from-a-30-year-old-laptop/FaxToBinary1_original.png" title="" width="761" height="647"><img src="https://www.unterminated.com/images/random-fun/how-to-copy-a-file-from-a-30-year-old-laptop/FaxToBinary1.png" alt="" title="Screenshot of the fax image to binary converter program I wrote, showing a document being processed" width="761" height="647"></a></p>

<p>I can use the preview on the left to quickly confirm whether the size and offset parameters are correct. Once they are, there will be no drift in the preview when moving between characters or lines. Processing can commence.</p>

<p>The actual character recognition takes a quick-and-dirty approach. For each unique pattern encountered, the program simply asks you to specify what it is, and subsequently remembers the answer for the next time it finds an identical-looking character.</p>

<p>(If for some strange reason anyone might find this program valuable, the source is available to download <a href="https://www.unterminated.com/files/random-fun/how-to-copy-a-file-from-a-30-year-old-laptop/FaxToBinary.zip">here</a>.)</p>

<p>After a bit of manual training, it outputs the file. Success! The audio plays back smoothly without any popping. It's a perfect byte-for-byte copy of the original file!</p>

<p>With the most complicated file copy in history finally complete, there's only one thing left to do.</p>

<h2>// <strong>What we found</strong></h2>



<p>Following last year’s <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/press-release/exiled-russian-media-pegasus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>joint investigation</strong></a> into the use of NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware against Galina Timchenko, co-founder, CEO, and publisher of <em>Meduza</em>, Access Now, <strong><a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2024/05/pegasus-russian-belarusian-speaking-opposition-media-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Citizen Lab at the Munk School of Global Affairs &amp; Public Policy at the University of Toronto (“the Citizen Lab”)</a></strong>, and independent digital security expert Nikolai Kvantiliani have uncovered how <strong>at least seven more </strong>Russian, Belarusian, Latvian, and Israeli<strong> journalists and activists have been targeted with NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware within the EU.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>



<h2>// <strong>Who was targeted</strong></h2>



<p>One victim, who has chosen to remain anonymous, is a <strong>member of Belarusian civil society currently based in Vilnius, Lithuania</strong>. After receiving an <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/faq-access-nows-digital-security-helpline-and-apple-threat-notifications/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Apple threat notification</strong></a> on June 22, 2023, that their device had been targeted with a state-sponsored attack, they reached out to the Citizen Lab for digital security support, who analyzed the device and <strong><a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2024/05/pegasus-russian-belarusian-speaking-opposition-media-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a></strong> that it was infected with Pegasus spyware on or around March 25, 2021. This date, “Freedom Day” (Dzień Voli), is a significant one, as it commemorates the Belarusian Democratic Republic’s 1918 declaration of independence. Freedom Day celebrations have historically been suppressed by Belarusian officials.</p>



<p>Another <strong>Russian journalist living in exile in Vilnius</strong> since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and who has also chosen to remain anonymous, received two Apple threat notifications on October 31, 2023, and on April 10, 2024. Access Now’s Digital Security Helpline, with the <strong><a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2024/05/pegasus-russian-belarusian-speaking-opposition-media-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">technical confirmation</a></strong> of the Citizen Lab, <strong><a href="https://www.accessnow.org/civil-society-in-exile-technical-brief" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">identified</a></strong> an attempt to infect the journalist’s device on or around June 15, 2023. On June 16, the journalist attended an event in Riga, Latvia, for Russian journalists in exile, which was organized by the Baltic Center for Media Excellence (BCME), DW Academy, and Sustainability Foundation. This event highlighted the ongoing vulnerabilities faced by media professionals in the region, underscoring the critical need for robust digital security measures. There were also other significant circumstances surrounding the June 15 hacking attempt that the journalist decided to keep private at this time due to personal safety concerns.</p>



<p>Three additional victims, all based in Riga, Latvia, <a href="https://meduza.io/en/news/2023/09/14/three-journalists-report-receiving-threat-notifications-from-apple-about-state-sponsored-attackers-targeting-their-devices" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>received</strong></a> Apple threat notifications. Access Now’s Digital Security Helpline <strong><a href="https://www.accessnow.org/civil-society-in-exile-technical-brief" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">analyzed</a></strong> their devices, with the Citizen Lab reviewing our results:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Evgeny Erlikh</strong>, an Israeli-Russian journalist and the author and former producer of <em>Baltic Weekly, </em>on <a href="https://about.rferl.org/service/current-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em><strong>Current Time</strong></em></a>, RFE RL’s 24/7 Russian-language TV network.&nbsp;Our analysis showed that Erlikh’s iPhone was infected with Pegasus spyware between November 28 and 29, 2022. At the time, Erlikh was vacationing in Austria with his spouse, who also received an Apple threat notification, but we were unable to forensically analyze her phone.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Evgeny Pavlov</strong>, a Latvian journalist, former correspondent for <a href="https://novayagazeta.ee/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em><strong>Novaya Gazeta Baltija</strong></em></a>, an independent news media covering the Baltic countries, and former freelance journalist for <em>Current Time’s Baltia </em>program. Pavlov’s device was targeted with Pegasus on or around November 28, 2022, and on or around April 24, 2023; however, we were unable to confirm if the attempts were successful.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Maria Epifanova</strong>, general director of <a href="https://novayagazeta.eu/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em><strong>Novaya Gazeta Europe</strong></em></a><em> </em>and director of <em>Novaya Gazeta Baltija.</em> Epifanova’s iPhone was infected on or around August 18, 2020 — the earliest known use of Pegasus to target Russian civil society. Epifanova was chief editor of <em>Novaya Gazeta Baltija</em> at the time, and the attack occurred shortly after she received accreditation to attend exiled Belarusian democratic opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya’s <a href="https://amp.meduza.io/en/feature/2020/08/21/i-hope-common-sense-will-prevail"><strong>first press conference in Vilniu</strong></a><a href="https://amp.meduza.io/en/feature/2020/08/21/i-hope-common-sense-will-prevail" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>s</strong></a>.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>Two Belarusian civil society members currently living in Warsaw, Poland, also received Apple notifications on October 31, 2023:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Andrei Sannikov</strong> is a prominent Belarusian opposition politician and activist, who ran for President of Belarus in 2010, receiving the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/20/alexander-lukashenko-belarus-president-election" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>second highest vote</strong></a> count after incumbent Alexander Lukashenko. After the election he was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/23/andrei-sannikov-world-complacent-belarus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>arrested by the Belarusian KGB</strong></a> and held as a prisoner of conscience. Authorities also threatened to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/10/world/europe/10belarus.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>take away his three-year old son</strong></a>. <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2024/05/pegasus-russian-belarusian-speaking-opposition-media-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>According to the Citizen Lab</strong></a>, Sannikov’s iPhone was infected with Pegasus on or around September 7, 2021.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Natallia Radzina</strong> is editor-in-chief of independent Belarusian media website <a href="http://charter97.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Charter97.org</strong></a> and a <a href="https://cpj.org/awards/natalya-radina/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>recipient</strong></a> of the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) International Press Freedom Award. Radzina was persecuted for journalistic activities in Belarus, imprisoned, and forced to flee the country. <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/civil-society-in-exile-technical-brief" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Access Now’s Digital Security Helpline</strong></a>, as <strong><a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2024/05/pegasus-russian-belarusian-speaking-opposition-media-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> </strong>by the Citizen Lab, also identified that Radzina’s device was infected with Pegasus spyware on or around December 2, 2022, December 7, 2022, and January 16, 2023. The first infection took place the day after Radzina’s participation in the <a href="https://www.forumfreerussia.org/en/archives-en/forum-awciii-en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Third Anti-War Conference</strong></a> in Vilnius, organized by the Free Russia Forum.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<h2>// <strong>New patterns emerge</strong></h2>



<p>Our investigation shows that the use of Pegasus spyware to target Russian- and Belarusian-speaking journalists and activists dates back until at least 2020, with more attacks following Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.</p>



<p>Access Now and the Citizen Lab also confirmed that five of the victims’ phones contained Apple IDs used by Pegasus operators in their attempts to hack the devices. We know that targeting via <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2023/04/nso-groups-pegasus-spyware-returns-in-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>various exploits</strong></a> that take advantage of bugs in <em>HomeKit</em> can leave a record of the attacker’s Apple ID email address on the victim’s device. The Citizen Lab believes that each Apple ID is used by a single Pegasus operator, though a single Pegasus operator might use multiple Apple IDs. We <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/civil-society-in-exile-technical-brief" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>found</strong></a> the same Apple ID email address present on Pavlov, Radzina, and the second anonymous victim’s phones. A separate email account was used to target both Erlikh and Pavlov’s phones on November 28, 2022. Artifacts from Andrei Sannikov and Natallia Radzina’s phones contained another separate identical email, <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2024/05/pegasus-russian-belarusian-speaking-opposition-media-europe/"><strong>according to the Citizen Lab</strong></a>. This suggests that a single Pegasus spyware operator may be behind the targeting of at least three of the victims and possibly all five.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>// <strong>Who is responsible?&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Access Now and the Citizen Lab are not publicly naming a specific operator at this time. Given that Poland has not been documented as targeting victims outside the country with Pegasus spyware, and considering <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/01/poland-launches-inquiry-into-previous-governments-spyware-use" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>reports</strong></a> that Poland’s government stopped using Pegasus spyware in 2021, it is unlikely that Poland is behind the attacks mentioned in this investigation. The Citizen Lab tells us that there is also no evidence suggesting that Russia, Belarus, or Lithuania are Pegasus customers. Latvia <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2018/09/hide-and-seek-tracking-nso-groups-pegasus-spyware-to-operations-in-45-countries/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>appears to use Pegasus</strong></a>, but the country is also not known for targeting victims outside of its borders. Estonia is another Baltic state that <a href="https://www.vm.ee/en/baltic-cooperation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>cooperates closely with Latvia and Lithuania on security matters</strong></a>, including regarding <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/latvia-lithuania-estonia-common-defense-zone-russia-border-security-concerns/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Russia and Belarus</strong></a>. According to the Citizen Lab, Estonia does appear to use Pegasus extensively outside their borders, including within multiple European countries.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>// <strong>The investigation continues</strong></h2>



<p>Access Now, the Citizen Lab, and other partners continue investigating these attacks against journalists, activists, and dissidents in exile and at home. We advise members of civil society to follow <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/help/access-nows-digital-security-helpline-and-apple-threat-notifications/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>digital security recommendations</strong></a>, which include updating your devices’ software or implementing <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/105120" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Apple Lockdown Mode</strong></a>. If you received an Apple threat notification or suspect your device may have been targeted with spyware, contact <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/help/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Access Now’s Digital Security Helpline</strong></a>; support is available in nine languages including <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/help-ru/?ignorelocale" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Russian</strong></a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the meantime, Access Now <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/press-release/world-press-freedom-day-no-to-spyware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>urges</strong></a> all governments to establish an immediate moratorium on the export, sale, transfer, servicing, and use of targeted digital surveillance technologies until rigorous human rights safeguards are put in place to regulate such practices, and to ban the use of spyware technologies such as Pegasus that have a history of enabling human rights abuses.&nbsp;</p>

			<h2>Description</h2>
						
										
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/james-joyce">James Joyce’s</a> most celebrated novel, and one of the most highly-regarded novels in the English language, records the events of one day—Thursday the 16th of June, 1904—in the city of Dublin.</p>
			<p>The reader is first reintroduced to Stephen Dedalus, the protagonist of Joyce’s previous novel <i><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/james-joyce/a-portrait-of-the-artist-as-a-young-man">A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</a></i>. Stephen is now living in a rented Martello tower and working at a school, having completed his B.A. and a period of attempted further study in Paris. The focus then shifts to the book’s protagonist, Leopold Bloom, an advertising canvasser and social outsider. It is a work day, so both Bloom and Stephen depart their homes for their respective journeys around Dublin.</p>
			<p>While containing a richly detailed story and still being generally described as a novel, <i>Ulysses</i> breaks many of the bounds otherwise associated with the form. It consists of eighteen chapters, or “episodes,” each somehow echoing a scene in <a href="https://standardebooks.org/standardebooks.org/ebooks/homer">Homer’s</a> <i><a href="https://standardebooks.org/standardebooks.org/ebooks/homer/the-odyssey">Odyssey</a></i>. Each episode takes place in a different setting, and each is written in a different, and often unusual, style. The book’s chief innovation is commonly cited to be its expansion of the “free indirect discourse” or “interior monologue” technique that Joyce used in his previous two books.</p>
			<p><i>Ulysses</i> is known not only for its formal novelty and linguistic inventiveness, but for its storied publication history. The first fourteen episodes of the book were serialized between 1918 and 1920 in <i>The Little Review</i>, while several episodes were published in 1919 in <i>The Egoist</i>. In 1921, the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice won a trial regarding obscenity in the thirteenth episode, “Nausicaa.” <i>The Little Review</i>’s editors were enjoined against publishing any further installments; <i>Ulysses</i> would not appear again in America until 1934.</p>
			<p>The outcome of the 1921 trial worsened Joyce’s already-considerable difficulties in finding a publisher in England. After lamenting to Sylvia Beach, owner of the Parisian bookshop Shakespeare and Company, that it might never be published at all, Beach offered to publish it in Paris, and <i>Ulysses</i> first appeared in its entirety in February 1922.</p>
			<p>The first printing of the first edition was filled with printing errors. A corrected second edition was published in 1924. Stuart Gilbert’s 1932 edition benefited from correspondence with Joyce, and claimed in its front matter to be “the definitive standard edition,” but was later found to have introduced errors of its own.</p>
			<p>The novel’s initial reception was mixed. W. B. Yeats called it “mad,” but would later agree with the positive assessments of T. S. Eliot and Ezra Pound, stating that it was “indubitably a work of genius.” Joyce’s second biographer Richard Ellmann reports that one doctor claimed to have seen writing of equal merit by his insane patients, and Virginia Woolf derided it as “underbred.” Joyce’s aunt, Josephine Murray, rejected it as “unfit to read” on account of its purported obscenity, to which Joyce famously retorted that if that were so, then life was not fit to live.</p>
			<p>The sheer density of references in the text make <i>Ulysses</i> a book that virtually demands of the reader access to critical interpretation; but it also makes it a book that is easily obscured by the industry of scholarship it has generated over the last century. The dismissal of a serious interpretation is tempting, but would trivialize Joyce’s enormous project as an extended joke or an elaborate exercise in ego. Likewise dismissing it as uninterpretable would ignore the profusion of earnest critical analyses.</p>
			<p>Today <i>Ulysses</i> is considered by many to be the zenith of 20th century literature: both one of the richest, and also the most difficult, books to ever be written. To appreciate it is not to think it unintelligible; rather, perhaps the best description of it is the one used of Ulysses himself in a 21st century translation of Homer’s epic—“complicated.”</p>
			<p>This Standard Ebooks edition is based on a transcription of the 1922 Shakespeare and Company first edition, with emendations from pre-1929 errata lists and the second edition in its 1927 ninth printing by Shakespeare and Company. It does not track any one particular edition, but rather is a blend of pre-1929 editions that aims to contain what scholars might consider to be the most accurate version of what was printed before 1929. Therefore, various probable misprints have been retained that may have been corrected in post-1929 editions. Consultation of various editions of the book and the historical collation list appended to Hans Walter Gabler’s Critical and Synoptic Edition is advised before contacting Standard Ebooks about potential mistakes.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Background</h2><p>In this research, we aim to shed light on one of the largest data breaches to date. By directly communicating with the threat actor behind the massive data breach of cloud storage giant, Snowflake, we gained unprecedented insight into the devastating impact of Infostealer infections.</p><p>The story begins on May 26th, in a Telegram conversation with a threat actor claiming to have hacked two major companies, Ticketmaster and Santander Bank.</p><p>The data from these companies was put up for sale on the Russian-speaking cybercrime forum, exploit[.]in. Database samples provided by the threat actor led Hudson Rock researchers to believe that the data is genuine.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fca25a41f2486d67ca50a27/6659c8904710114ef2cde09f_snowflake_breach_infostealer_1.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Santander bank data offered for sale on exploit.in</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p>In the conversation with Hudson Rock, the threat actor reveals that there is much more to the story than these two breaches, and that additional major companies suffered a similar fate, allegedly including many of Snowflake’s customers which can be found on their website <a href="https://www.snowflake.com/en/customers/all-customers/">https://www.snowflake.com/en/customers/all-customers/</a></p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fca25a41f2486d67ca50a27/6659fde3cdab6ec3e1de9952_snowflake_breach_infostealer_11.jpeg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Further explaining the source of the hack, the threat actor adds that all of these breaches stem from the hack of a single vendor — <strong>Snowflake.</strong></p><p>To understand how the hack was carried out, the threat actor explains that they <strong>were able to sign into a Snowflake employee’s ServiceNow account using stolen credentials, thus bypassing OKTA</strong> which is located on lift.snowflake.com.</p><p>Following the infiltration, the threat actor claims that they were able to generate session tokens, which enabled them to exfiltrate massive amounts of data from the company.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fca25a41f2486d67ca50a27/6659c9a73e3e72084057d129_snowflake_breach_infostealer_4.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Method used to hack Snowflake as shared by the threat actor</figcaption></figure><p>To put it bluntly, a single credential resulted in the exfiltration of potentially hundreds of companies that stored their data using Snowflake, with the threat actor himself suggesting <strong>400 companies</strong> are impacted.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fca25a41f2486d67ca50a27/6659c9dd4819e4c75164f16e_snowflake_breach_infostealer_5.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>The goal of the threat actor, as in most cases, was to blackmail Snowflake into buying their own data back for $20,000,000.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fca25a41f2486d67ca50a27/6659ca0acfde96dab7c9802b_snowflake_breach_infostealer_6.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>However it seems the company was not responsive.</p><p>Further evidence of the hack includes a CSV file that the threat actor shared with Hudson Rock’s researchers, which shows the depth of their access to Snowflake servers.</p><p><strong>This file documents over 2,000 customer instances relating to Snowflake’s Europe servers.</strong></p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fca25a41f2486d67ca50a27/6659ca4be3b72f6f6a02bb9d_snowflake_breach_infostealer_7.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Screenshot of “snowflake_eu-orgadmin.csv shared with Hudson Rock researchers</figcaption></figure><h2>One credential to rule them all</h2><p>Going over the data found in the CSV file, Hudson Rock researchers identified a Snowflake employee who was infected by a Lumma-type Infostealer on October 5th, 2023. Along with other sensitive credentials to Snowflake’s infrastructure, this employee’s login details (adelou) to a specific server (<a href="https://sfseeurope-demo_adelou.snowflakecomputing.com/" target="_blank">https://sfseeurope-demo_adelou.snowflakecomputing.com</a>) were also compromised.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fca25a41f2486d67ca50a27/6659cae5a84af0ec5815ce89_snowflake_breach_infostealer_8.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>When asked about the specific credentials used to carry out the hack, the threat actor confirmed to Hudson Rock researchers that indeed these are the same credentials they used, and shared a mutual sentiment with us around the absolute ease in which this gigantic hack could have been prevented.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fca25a41f2486d67ca50a27/6659cb1905d7fc2915dcfdea_snowflake_breach_infostealer_9.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>It is still undetermined what other companies were impacted by the hack. We expect that this information will be revealed slowly and over time as negotiations with the impacted companies are still ongoing.</p><p>On may 31st, Snowflake released a statement in which they claim that they are investigating an industry-wide identity-based attacks that have impacted “some” of their customers.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fca25a41f2486d67ca50a27/6659cb4dcfde96dab7ca91f1_snowflake_breach_infostealer_10.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Hudson Rock will follow up with updates relating to this hack.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fca25a41f2486d67ca50a27/650048771a2cfcc288058ab8_seperator.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Info-stealer infections as a cybercrime trend surged by an incredible 6000% since 2018, positioning them as the primary initial attack vector used by threat actors to infiltrate organizations and execute cyberattacks, including ransomware, data breaches, account overtakes, and corporate espionage.</p><p>To learn more about how Hudson Rock protects companies from imminent intrusions caused by info-stealer infections of employees, partners, and users, as well as how we enrich existing cybersecurity solutions with our <a href="https://cavalier.hudsonrock.com/docs" target="_blank">cybercrime intelligence API</a>, please schedule a call with us, here: <a href="https://www.hudsonrock.com/schedule-demo" target="_blank">https://www.hudsonrock.com/schedule-demo</a></p><p>We also provide access to various free cybercrime intelligence tools that you can find here: <a href="http://www.hudsonrock.com/free-tools" target="_blank">www.hudsonrock.com/free-tools</a></p><p>Thanks for reading, <strong>Rock Hudson Rock!</strong></p><p>Follow us on LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/hudson-rock" target="_blank">https://www.linkedin.com/company/hudson-rock</a></p><p>Follow us on Twitter: <a href="https://www.twitter.com/RockHudsonRock" target="_blank">https://www.twitter.com/RockHudsonRock</a></p><p>‍</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>Spotify will refund owners of Car Thing, its Spotify-playing device that mounts to car dashboards, Ars Technica confirmed today. On May 23, Spotify announced that it would <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/pleas-for-open-sourcing-refunds-as-spotify-plans-to-brick-car-thing-devices/">brick all Car Things</a> on December 9.</p>
<p>Spotify started notifying customers via email on May 24 that they could reach out to <a href="https://support.spotify.com/us/contact-spotify-support/">this support channel</a> if they have questions about Car Thing's discontinuation. The email doesn't explicitly guarantee refunds, though, which could leave some thinking they have no way to get reimbursed for the gadget that initially sold for $90. Further, Spotify's <a href="https://support.spotify.com/us/article/car-thing-discontinued/">support page</a> for Car Thing doesn't mention refunds and only tells owners to reset and properly dispose of or recycle the gadget.</p>
<p>A Spotify spokesperson declined to confirm to Ars if Spotify would offer full refunds to everyone who showed proof of purchase or if there were further requirements. The representative said that owners should contact Spotify via the above link about refunds.</p>
<p>Since Spotify said it would brick all Car Things, customers have shown confusion about refund availability online (on Spotify's <a href="https://community.spotify.com/t5/Car-Thing/Spotify-car-thing-discontinued/td-p/6088931/page/35">online forum</a> and on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/spotify/comments/1cyx5fs/car_thing_discontinued_with_no_refund_option/?sort=new">Reddit</a>), and they may have received mixed messaging from Spotify support.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.billboard.com/pro/spotify-class-action-lawsuit-car-thing-deactivation-full-complaint/">Billboard</a>, on May 28, three people filed a lawsuit [<a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Spotify.pdf">PDF</a>] that seeks class-action certification (and cites Ars) against Spotify. It claims that people "would not have purchased a Car Thing if they knew that Spotify would stop supporting the product within just a few months or years of purchase." It also states that "Spotify has stated that it will not refund, or replace, the Car Thing."</p>
<p>But recent online posts from people who say they were able to provide Spotify with proof of purchase claim that they received refunds.</p>
<p>Ars reached out to the lawyers for the plaintiffs of the lawsuit filed in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York, asking if the case would still be pursued since Spotify is giving refunds. Spotify declined to comment on the lawsuit to Ars.</p>                                            
                                                        
<h2>Still not open-sourcing</h2>
<p>Some remain frustrated by the scheduled obsolescence of hardware that was only <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/02/spotify-car-thing-is-a-90-thing-that-plays-spotify-in-your-car/">released to the general public</a> in February 2022. Car Thing first released to a limited number of subscribers in October 2021.</p>
<p>As noted by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/30/spotify-begins-offering-car-thing-refunds-as-it-faces-lawsuit-over-bricking-the-streaming-device/">TechCrunch</a> today, in October 2021, Spotify CEO and founder Daniel Ek <a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/10/27/spotify-technology-sa-spot-q3-2021-earnings-call-t/">said</a> that more than 2 million people initially signed up for the Car Thing waitlist. By July 2022, Spotify revealed that it was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/07/spotify-is-no-longer-making-its-car-thing-music-player/">no longer making Car Thing</a>, its only hardware, naming product demand and supply chain issues as factors. However, the company cut the device's price tag from $90 to $50 and kept selling it.</p>
<p>For many, Car Thing didn't make much sense. In addition to an auxiliary connection, it required a Spotify Premium subscription and a Bluetooth-connected phone using Wi-Fi or data to work. However, some found the 4-inch touchscreen and large knob handy. Car Thing also appealed to some people who didn't have integrated touchscreens in their car or support for other popular means for playing Spotify in the car, like Apple CarPlay.</p>
<p>Since Spotify announced that it will forcibly brick all Car Things in December, users have been pleading with the company to open-source the device. This would help people extend the hardware's life and minimize waste. However, Spotify has been unwilling to unlock the device. Unlocking Car Thing could, theoretically, allow people to hack the device—which carries a Spotify logo on its left edge—in ways Spotify doesn't want to be associated with. However, open source advocates and those concerned about e-waste argue that opening the device would still be a better solution than bricking devices after less than three years of general availability.</p>
<p>For example, a user on Spotify's forum who <a href="https://community.spotify.com/t5/Car-Thing/Spotify-car-thing-discontinued/td-p/6088931/page/35">said</a> they got a refund and goes by "zequfy" wrote today that "this does NOT solve the issue."</p>
<blockquote><p>If they continue with the plan to brick Car Thing in December, the refunds won’t matter when our anger &amp; disappointment resurfaces, and we remember why they lost our trust as users. Tell them you may still leave the service.</p></blockquote>
<p>As Spotify currently looks unlikely to do more to appease Car Thing owners, this incident may have to serve as a cautionary tale for people considering buying hardware from a company that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/series/google-kills-product/">might not commit</a> to long-term support. Remembering that the company could break the product at any time may make you reconsider opening your wallet.</p>

        <p>If you own an Intel motherboard with a Z170 or Z270 chipset, you might believe that it only supports CPUs up to Intel’s 7th generation, known as Kaby Lake. Even the CPU socket’s pinout is different in the next generation — we are told, it will fit the same socket, but it won’t boot. So if you want a newer CPU, you’ll have to buy a new motherboard while you’re at it. Or do you?</p>

You can even preserve compatibility with the 6th/7th generation CPUs after doing this mod, should you ever need to go back to an older chip. Contrasting this to AMD’s high degree of CPU support on even old Ryzen motherboards, it’s as if Intel introduced this incompatibility intentionally.</p>
<p><a href="https://winraid.level1techs.com/t/tool-easy-automated-mod-tool-for-coffee-lake-bios/32795" target="_blank">There’s been</a> a <a href="https://community.hwbot.org/topic/175489-asrock-z170-mocf-lives-on-coffee-lake-mods/" target="_blank">number of posts</a> on <a href="https://winraid.level1techs.com/t/guide-fixing-ht-for-coffee-lake-cpus-on-skylake-and-kaby-lake-motherboards-z170-z270/32665" target="_blank">various PC forums</a> and YouTube videos, going through the process and showing off the tools used to modify the BIOS. Some mods are exceptionally easy to apply. For example, if you have the Asus Maximus VIII Ranger motherboard, a single jumper wire between two pads next to the EC <a href="https://www.techpowerup.com/forums/threads/adventure-running-8-9th-gen-coffee-lake-cpus-on-z170-motherboard-asus-maximus-viii-ranger.284375/" target="_blank">will enable support without Kapton tape,</a> a mod that likely could be figured out for other similar motherboards as well. There’s a few aspects to keep in mind, like making sure your board’s VRMs are good enough for the new chip, and a little more patching might be needed for hyper-threading, but nothing too involved.</p>
<p>Between money-grab features like this that hamper even the simplest of upgrades and increase e-waste, <a href="https://hackaday.com/2018/01/05/lets-talk-intel-meltdown-and-spectre/">fun vulnerabilities</a>, and inability to sort out problems like stability power consumption issues, it’s reassuring to see users take back control over their platforms <a href="https://hackaday.com/2024/01/05/enabling-intel-amt-for-bios-over-wifi/">wherever possible</a>, and brings us back to the days of modding Xeon CPUs to fit into 775 sockets.</p>
<p>Don’t get too excited though, as projects like Intel BootGuard are bound to hamper mods like this on <a href="https://hackaday.com/2023/04/12/disabling-intels-backdoors-on-modern-laptops/">newer generations</a> by introducing digital signing for BIOS images, <a href="https://hackaday.com/2017/12/11/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-intel-management-engine/">flying under the banner of user security</a> yet again. Alas, it appears way more likely that Intel’s financial security is the culprit.</p>

<span>|</span></p><p>Twenty-five years. A quarter century. That's how long we've been working on Krita. Well, what would become Krita. It started out as KImageShop, but that name was nuked by a now long-dead German lawyer. Then it was renamed to Krayon, and that name was also nuked. Then it was renamed to Krita, and that name stuck.</p><p>I only became part of Krita in 2003, when Krita was still part of KDE's suite of productivity applications, KOffice, later renamed to Calligra... And I became <a href="https://marc.info/?l=kde-kimageshop&amp;m=107877497900328&amp;w=2">maintainer of Krita in 2004</a>, when Patrick Julien handed over the baton. That means that I've been around Krita for about twenty of those twenty-five years, so I'll hope you, dear reader, will forgive me for making this a really personal post; a very large part of my life has been tied up with Krita, and it's going to show.</p><p>But let’s first go back to before when I needed a digital painting application; the first seeds for Krita were laid in 1998, even earlier than the first bits of code. There was this excitement around Linux back then, and there were lots of projects that attempted to create great applications for Linux. One of those projects was GIMP, and another project was Qt. The first was a digital image manipulation application, the other was a toolkit to create user-friendly applications in C++. But GIMP didn't use Qt, it used its home-grown user interface toolkit (although it originally used Motif, which wasn't open source). A Qt fan, Matthias Ettrich, did an experimental port of GIMP to Qt, and gave a presentation about it at the <a href="http://www.linux-kongress.org/1998/abstracts.html">1998 Linux Kongress</a>. That wasn't received well, and resulted in the kind of spat that is typical of the open source community. People were young and tempers were hot.</p><p>Well, in cases like this, the only solution is to go at it yourself, and that's what happened. It took several false starts, but on the last day of May 1999, <a href="https://marc.info/?l=kde-devel&amp;m=92815444812221&amp;w=2">Matthias Elter and Michael Koch started KImageShop</a>: read the mail, because it's quite funny how we did and didn't follow the original vision (KOM was a Corba-like thing, and if you have never heard of Corba, that's probably because Corba was a terrible idea.).</p><figure><img src="https://krita.org/images/posts/2024/kimageshop_project_started.png" alt="|Screenshot of the first mail" title="|Screenshot of the first mail"></figure><p>Development started, and believe it or not, there's still some actual code dating back to then in Krita's codebase, though most of the remaining code is opening and closing brackets.</p><p>And then development stopped, because, well, doing a proper image manipulation application isn't easy or quick work. And then it started again, and stopped again, and started again. There were several maintainers before I was looking for a nice, performant codebase for a painting application in 2003. I didn't know C++; but I had written the first book on using Python and Qt together.</p><p>Krita had been rewritten to the point where it didn't even have a paint tool, so that was the first thing I wanted to have. That was not easy!</p><figure><img src="https://krita.org/images/posts/2024/25_years_screenshot1.png" alt="|Screenshot of the first attempt at a brush engine" title="|Screenshot of the first attempt at a brush engine"></figure><p>But... Being open about it not being easy meant people got interested, and we started gaining contributors. And so, in 2004, we had a small team of enthusiastic people. A lot happened in that year; Camilla Boemann rewrote the core of Krita so we had autosizing layers, Adrian Page wrote an OpenGL based backend, Cyrille Berger added the first inklings of plugins and scripting. Our approach was still pretty technical, though, and we didn't manage to make a release.</p><p>It was only in 2005 that we released Krita as part of KOffice 1.4. Still very immature, but everyone agreed that it was promising, and we got nice reviews in some Linux magazines -- that was still a thing in 2005.</p><figure><img src="https://krita.org/images/posts/2024/Krita_1.4.2.png" alt="|Screenshot of Krita 1.4" title="|Screenshot of Krita 1.4"></figure><p>Then came 2006. And Krita 1.5 was released with support for color managed CMYK. Krita 1.5 also had the short-lived real color mixing watercolor layer feature, but that was too complex to maintain. And in the same year, we released Krita 1.6: Linux Journal called it <a href="https://www.linux.com/news/krita-16-state-art/">State of the Art</a>. We thought it was a pretty mature release, but artists who gave us feedback still found it lacking a lot.</p><p>And then disaster struck. Qt3 reached end-of-life, and Qt4 was released. The porting effort was huge and took ages, also because we, foolishly, decided to rewrite a lot of the 1.x code to make it possible to share components between KOffice applications. The rewrite took all of 2007, 2008 and half of 2009.</p><p>In the meantime, when we were desperately trying to fix all the bugs the porting and rewrite were introducing, we held our first fundraiser: that was to get Wacom tablets for testing Krita with, complete with art pens. I am still using the Wacom Intuos 3 we got way back then!</p><p>In 2009, we then released Krita 2.0. It was not really usable, but it was important for us to have something out that we could get people to test. Krita 2.1 was also released in 2009. We also got our <a href="https://dot.kde.org/2009/12/02/krita-team-seeking-sponsorship-take-krita-next-level">first sponsored developer, Lukáš Tvrdý</a>, whose task specifically was to fix all bugs. Later on, he also improved the performance of Krita's brushes.</p><p>As Krita gained recognition, we got more and more feedback, and in 2010, we decided to have a big sprint in Deventer where we were going to determine what we wanted Krita to be for our users. A Photoshop clone? A GIMP clone? A Corel Painter Clone? Or something that was itself. Who were we making Krita for?</p><p>The answer is true to today: we are making Krita for digital artists who are making art, mostly from scratch. Painting with Krita should be fun for artists of all kinds, all over the world.</p><p>But it would be some time before we'd reach that goal. 2010 saw Krita 2.2 and Krita 2.3: we thought that Krita 2.3 was ready for artists, but it was only with Krita 2.4 and 2.5 in 2012 that Krita really became pretty good! In fact, we had a laser-precise focus: for some years our rallying call was “Make Krita usable for David Revoy!” – partly silly, but also partly serious. We spent time during dev sprints observing artists and allowing them to live comment on what they liked and didn’t like, without the observing developers being allowed to open their mouths, wether in rebuttal or to help the artist out.</p><p>In the meantime, I had created the Krita Foundation so we could do fund-raisers to sponsor full-time developers. The first developer we sponsored was Dmitry Kazakov, who is still the lead developer for Krita.</p><p>Back then, Krita was still part of KDE's office suite, but it was called Calligra now, because of an interminable conflict with just one KOffice developer, the KWord maintainer. All that energy spent on that conflict could have gone into development, it was a huge waste. From the Calligra days onwards, development went much smoother. Nokia was now involved with Calligra's development, and the resulting improvement in the central libraries all applications used also helped improve Krita, though, conversely, the complexity needed to support a very diverse set of applications is still burdening us today.</p><p>Years went by. 2013 was completely uneventful. We made our releases (2.6, 2.7), did our fund-raisers, added features (like animation support), created a version of Krita with a special user interface for touch/tablet users (sponsored by Intel: we still have a great relationship with Intel, our main development fund sponsor). It was great to see the art people were creating, great to get feedback from users and just plain fun to tackle development.</p><figure><img src="https://krita.org/images/posts/2013/kritasketch_2.png" alt="|Screenshot of Krita Sketch" title="|Screenshot of Krita Sketch"></figure><p>In 2014 we ported Krita to Windows, also because of the touch/tablet version of Krita. And we released eleven versions of Krita 2.9, which was really a very fine release.</p><p>Also in 2014, we had our first Kickstarter campaign. Kickstarter was new and fresh back then, and it was really exciting. We got nearly 700 people to sponsor Krita! And we ported Krita to MacOS. For some time we would do a Kickstarter campaign every year, and they were fun both for us and for our developers, we'd set stretch goals and let people vote on what they wanted us to work on.</p><figure><img src="https://krita.org/images/posts/2014/kickstarter.png" alt="|The first kickstarter page" title="|The first kickstarter page"></figure><p>I still had a day job back then, so it was all work done in the evenings and weekends, and on the train during my commute.</p><p>We also started porting Krita, again, this time to Qt5. That wasn't as hard as the port from Qt3 to Qt4, but we lost support for the tablet version of Krita because Qt5 made it impossible to properly integrate our OpenGL based canvas in the touch version of Qt5's libraries. We spent months and quite a bit of money on that, but it was no-go.</p><p>Then I broke my shoulder and lost my day job, with Blue Systems, and suddenly the Krita Foundation needed to pay me, too. Fortunately, we found a sponsor for the port to Qt5, and that was my first sponsored project.</p><p>In 2016, we released Krita 3.0 -- it wasn't as good as Krita 2.9, but thankfully we still remembered the pain we had when doing a rewrite combined with a port, so we simply did the port first, and didn't combine it with a huge rewrite. This had animation!</p><figure><img src="https://krita.org/images/posts/2024/krita_animation2.gif" alt="|The first kickstarter page" title="|The first kickstarter page"></figure><p>We also released our first and last paper artbook. A huge amount of work for me, which already started in 2015 and in the end, a huge money sink, too.</p><figure><img src="https://krita.org/images/posts/2017/artbook-spread.jpg" alt="|The artbook" title="|The artbook"></figure><p>We worked on improved versions of Krita 3.0 all through 2016 and 2017. 2018 rolled by, and we released Krita 4.0, with the results of Kickstarter-sponsored work. Though not all of it, because in 2017, I was preoccupied with the Great Tax Disaster. The Dutch tax office wanted us to pay tens of thousands of euros in VAT for the work Dmitry had done; that's when we hired a proper accountant instead of a small business administration office in a local town.</p><p>When we went <a href="https://krita.org/en/posts/2017/krita-foundation-in-trouble/">public with the problems</a>, donations streamed in and PIA made a huge donation: they basically covered the bill.</p><p>To avoid having this happen again, I brought all commercial activities into a separate one-person company. That became even more important, because in 2017, we put Krita in the Windows Store. That was the second store, after we put Krita on the Steam Store in 2014. Since then, we have released Krita on Epic Store, the Google Play Store and now even on the Apple MacOS Store.</p><p>Time went on, and in 2018, we released Krita 4.1, in 2019 4.2, in 2020 Krita 4.3 and 4.4. Reasonably quiet years of active development, growing user base and popularity. More and more sponsored developers joined in, and Krita made a lot of progress.</p><p>Although the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/KritaOrgPainting">Krita YouTube channel</a> already existed, in 2019, we asked Ramon Miranda to work on regular videos for our channel:</p><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_9zZNHj5A_Y" allowfullscreen="" title="YouTube Video"></iframe></p><p>By now we've built up quite a list of impressive tutorials of all kinds, teaching everything from digital painting itself to creating brush presets!</p><p>And then development slowed down. In 2020, the effects of Covid19 became more and more clear. We couldn't have sprints anymore, so no hyper-productive in-person development sessions anymore. Team members got sick, for some, really sick. Long Covid has crashed my own productivity: there are many days when I can do nothing but lie down in a darkened room.</p><p>By 2021, even though we hadn't had to port Krita to a new version of Krita, we still decided to change vector layers from ODG to SVG, which made Krita files incompatible between versions 4 and 5. A major change in file format, in other words. We're still working on new versions of Krita 5: 5.1 in 2022, 5.2 in 2023.</p><p>The future promises a very nice Krita 5.3!</p><p>And also, groan, a Krita 6.0 because we have started porting Krita to Qt6. And that's no fun, because Qt6 is again a huge change in what Qt offers and allows.</p><p>And that was 25 years of working on something I started dabbling in because I wanted to draw a map for a fantasy novel on my laptop!</p><hr><p>Join the <a href="https://fund.krita.org/">Development Fund</a> with a monthly donation.

The budget didn’t solve, so cost controls and structural changes became necessary. </p><p>The service’s Chief of Staff, Gen. Mark Welsh, announced a reduction of 25,000 airmen, around 7% of the workforce. He directed it be done rapidly, and simultaneous with operational workload intensifying. The cuts were in a portfolio of measures to prevent the service running out of cash. Or so it was argued.</p><p>It was a dire situation, Welsh told commanders. Every unit would need to trim back and find new ways to conserve. Every individual would feel the pinch. Everyone would need to change their behavior. </p><p><em>Because every dollar counted.</em></p><p>Except it all turned out to be a load of BS. While airmen in the field were getting rinsed and nit-picked over nickels and slogging harder than ever, Welsh and his fellow executives continued a royalty lifestyle. </p><p>They splashed tens of millions annually on private jets, personal assistants, and chauffeurs. The generals had their own bands, their own traveling show choir, and uniformed servants to prepare their meals, clean their taxpayer-funded houses, and pluck weeds from their lawns.</p><p>Welsh’s cost philosophy failed to take root in the rank and file, because everyone could see every dollar didn’t count. What did take hold was a generational morale crisis, as airmen lost trust and confidence in their leaders. Responding to complaints from overworked pilots, generals encouraged them to quit. Someone else would backfill them.</p><p>The Air Force ended up with a huge pilot shortage, a recruitment problem, and record suicide rates. It lost strategic footing, with troubled acquisition programs, decaying infrastructure, and aging aircraft supported by exhausted and frustrated airmen. Strong airmen left service while others reduced their effort levels.</p><p>The situation wasn’t created by the pressures of war or the federal budget. It was created by the arrogance and dishonesty of executives.</p><p>I recognize that same blend of toxicity now as I observe the conduct of Amazon’s senior executives. The same lack of empathy. The same reliance on authority. The same self-obsessed belief in their own brilliance. Most of all, the same low regard for those who create their company’s value.</p><p>Before I explain why I feel comfortable asserting these things, let me tell you about something called Ops Live.</p><p>Every couple of years, Amazon gathers every individual in a director or VP level role in its global fulfillment, transportation, and logistics operations together in one place for a “conference.” The idea is to get everyone collaborating about the current and future state of the business.</p><p>In reality, it’s an overpriced party and networking event legendary for one-way messaging from corporate mouthpieces, usually absorbed through the foggy veil of a shareholder-funded hangover. The swag package is great. Thematically, it’s fun and vibrant. But a conference, it isn’t.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5bc5dfca-59fc-4b38-96d2-8165c924ba37_800x680.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5bc5dfca-59fc-4b38-96d2-8165c924ba37_800x680.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5bc5dfca-59fc-4b38-96d2-8165c924ba37_800x680.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5bc5dfca-59fc-4b38-96d2-8165c924ba37_800x680.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5bc5dfca-59fc-4b38-96d2-8165c924ba37_800x680.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5bc5dfca-59fc-4b38-96d2-8165c924ba37_800x680.jpeg" width="800" height="680" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5bc5dfca-59fc-4b38-96d2-8165c924ba37_800x680.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:680,&quot;width&quot;:800,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Akhil Saxena (He/His/Him) on LinkedIn: #amazon #leadership #networking  #automation #connections #leaders #future… | 19 comments&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="Akhil Saxena (He/His/Him) on LinkedIn: #amazon #leadership #networking  #automation #connections #leaders #future… | 19 comments" title="Akhil Saxena (He/His/Him) on LinkedIn: #amazon #leadership #networking  #automation #connections #leaders #future… | 19 comments" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5bc5dfca-59fc-4b38-96d2-8165c924ba37_800x680.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5bc5dfca-59fc-4b38-96d2-8165c924ba37_800x680.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5bc5dfca-59fc-4b38-96d2-8165c924ba37_800x680.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5bc5dfca-59fc-4b38-96d2-8165c924ba37_800x680.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>I attended Ops Live in ‘22.

It reflects an authoritarian psyche. Executives doing what they can while mere workers suffer what they must. </p><p>It reflects an unspoken embrace of inequality. For the masses, a slice of pizza, a handful of chocolates during mandatory overtime, and a free cupcake to celebrate inclusion when they’re not really included.</p><p>For the elites, a private concert from a headlining rock band in between tour stops, then off to another round of pounding the table to demand higher productivity. Which will be needed to pay for future executive parties.</p><p>Meanwhile, a burned out workforce stretched by efficiency squeezes toils in constant fear of financial insolvency or ambush job loss, stretched on the rack to save every dollar. Because every dollar counts, right?</p><p><strong>And this brings us to the dishonesty.</strong></p><p>It is dishonest to pretend job cuts are necessary when they are not. </p><p>It is dishonest to pretend it’s necessary to freeze salaries when it isn’t.</p><p>It is dishonest to pretend people aren’t stretching to cover multiple roles after those to their left and right have been laid off, and then to further ignore or downplay the impacts of such overstretch.</p><p>And of course, it’s dishonest to pretend leadership principles matter for everyone when it’s clear certain ones don’t apply to executives. There is nothing frugal about a private rock concert. And having exclusive, expensive parties during downsizing is a trust killer.</p><p><strong>Why This Matters</strong></p><p>At this moment in time, Amazon is displaying a lack of integrity and a high degree of executive arrogance.</p><p>That might be alright in a certain kind of business. You might get away with it elsewhere. But it won’t work in a business that depends on teamwork, trust, and discretionary effort. A business where leadership is key, and therefore character matters. A business where authority ultimately depends on the consent of the governed.</p><p>People won't follow hypocrites. They won't follow liars. They won't follow bullies. They won’t follow the self-obsessed. Or more precisely, the type who will follow such types are not the type you want.</p><p>This spells trouble for Amazon. The company is far more dependent on discretionary effort than other sorts of businesses. And maybe, based on this evidence, more dependent on discretionary effort than it realizes.</p><p>Maybe it doesn’t realize that its operation depends on rallying people to give more. To stretch. To fill gaps and make glove saves. To go the extra mile. To keep working when you’re tired. To take the extra time to learn and improve.</p><p>Operations, by its very nature, depends on everyone giving everything they’ve got. If everyone throttles back to contractual obligation and nothing more, Amazon fails very quickly. And to keep those throttles advanced, people need leaders they respect and believe in.</p><p><strong>How to Lose People</strong></p><p><span>Maybe Amazon knows it needs discretionary effort from people but chooses to try and extract it another way. It seems to prefer </span><em><strong>coercion</strong></em><span> as a method to keep people producing rather than inspiring them and earning their best.</span></p><p>Ambush style layoffs remove the feeling of safety, making people desperate to prove they shouldn’t be next. With this approach, Amazon embraces a timelessly blood-curdling rationale: nothing concentrates the mind like a credible threat.</p><p>Annual attrition targets for a fixed percentage of people every year create a survival mentality. No one wants to be the slowest gazelle when the lion comes around again, so everyone runs faster. Classic coercion.</p><p>Making people rehearse for months or years in the next higher role before they can be promoted is also coercive. They give more than they are paid to give so they can keep their careers moving. Amazon gets their best effort at a discount, and while keeping open the option of never promoting them.</p><p>Creating career survival competitions among people is a common Amazon tactic resulting from its adherence to a “rank and yank” talent assessment process. No one wants to be ranked low enough to be at risk, so people become cut-throat, out-maneuvering one another rather than deliver their own individual best. </p><p>All of this coercion drives a fearful and defensive mindset among Amazon’s rank-and-file. A negative culture follows, with high stress and legendary burnout.</p><p>But executives aren’t doing it by mistake. </p><p>They’re obviously possessed of the view that flexing authority and posing tacit threats to people is an effective way, a cheaper way, and more power-serving way to keep them productive enough to solve the business. </p><p>But it also means executives are aware, deep down in places they don’t talk about at Ops Live, that they are dependent on operational performance. </p><p>Which means that if the current levels of arrogance and dishonesty continue, catastrophe will at some point come. This is a clinic in how to lose people, and the ones with principles will be the first to go.</p><p><strong>“Disgusting”</strong></p><p>This is how mid-level managers are describing Ops Live as word of it filters around. I’ve heard this word several times the past few days.</p><p>Amazon’s mid-level managers have had the unenviable task of firing people, sometimes by ambush. They’ve had to rally performance in groups of people fearful of more layoffs. They’ve had their own pay frozen after reasonably expecting to share more in their company’s epic financial successes. </p><p>All in the name of frugality. </p><p>To now see that frugality (a) isn’t really a concern and (b) doesn’t apply to senior leaders makes them feel they’re managers for a dishonest organization which takes them for granted.</p><p>Like the Air Force of a decade ago, today’s Amazon is courting strategic failure. The question is whether there is enough humility to see it, and enough honesty to acknowledge it.</p><p>The circumstances of this debacle make me doubtful on both counts.</p><p><em>TC is an independent writer and speak on organizational leadership.

                                            <p><span>There’s a new high water mark for passive aggressiveness in the visual arts—and the pun is intended.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When the town of Seaside, California ordered homeowner Etienne Constable to build a fence to conceal the boat in his driveway, he erected the fence all right. And then he hired his neighbor, artist <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hanifwondir/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hanif Panni</a>, to paint a mural on the fence—realistically depicting the boat itself. Call it passive-aggressive, call it malicious compliance, but in any event, call it hilarious.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“I’m not a rule-breaker but I like to make a political statement as necessary as well as a humorous statement and a creative statement,” Constable told </span><a href="https://www.ksbw.com/article/man-strikes-back-against-seaside-order-with-boat-mural/60749038"><span>NBC affiliate KSBW of Monterey Bay</span></a><span>. The city had threatened a $100 fine if Constable didn’t comply, but, ironically, he ended up paying for more than that for the artist’s fee alone.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“It was his idea,” Hanif said in a phone interview. “There were </span><i><span>Home Improvement</span></i><span>-kind of moments, where we were chatting and joking about it, a ‘Wouldn’t that be hilarious?’ kind of thing. I think the more he got it ingrained in his head and brought it up a lot, the more I thought, ‘Yeah, that sounds great.’”</span></p>

<p><span>The story has gone wildly viral, reported in news outlets and catching fire on social media.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“To be the number one Google result for ‘boat fence painting,’ that is a trophy that I never knew that I needed,” Hanif said.</span></p>
<p><span>“He’s the quintessentially good neighbor,” he said about Constable. “We’re pals, we talk, we share a backyard fence, so we’ll be working in our respective gardens and chatting. His boat has always been a friend of mine. I’ve never been on it but he invites me. He brings vacuum-sealed fresh salmon for me and the family.”</span></p>
<p><span>“Everybody loves it,” said Constable in a phone interview. “It’s amazing to not have the controversy that can come up from random things on the Internet. I love the fact that people appreciate my zany idea.” </span></p>
<p><span>Why does Constable think it has caught fire the way it has?</span></p>
<p><span>“I think the reason is because it’s absolutely in your face and it’s absolutely not offensive,” he said. “It was done very elegantly, it’s got a statement, it’s artwork so it’s open to interpretation, as is the political statement, and it all comes together in a perfect picture.”</span></p>
<p><span>The mural is painstakingly done; the result looks exactly like Constable’s 19-foot Arima Sea Ranger. Not only that: the shrubs on one side of the driveway as well as Constable’s house on the other side are also faithfully depicted in Hanif’s fence painting.</span></p>
<p><span>“This struck me as the right way to go, and something that makes my house unique,” the homeowner told </span><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/05/14/seaside-california-man-paints-boat-mural-driveway-fence/73683545007/"><i><span>USA Today</span></i></a><span>. At least one local official is on Team Constable: “I applaud the constituent’s creative approach, which not only addresses compliance but also showcases a community-driven solution,” city council member Alexis García-Arrazola told the news outlet.</span></p>
<p><span>Hanif studied art and art history at the University of Oregon and is a working multidisciplinary artist in a wide range of formats. He has worked with clients as varied as Lexus and the Pharcyde, as well as for Google (for whom he has done DJ work) and the Wu-Tang Clan (the Staten Island rap titans have displayed his banners onstage at their performances).&nbsp;</span></p>

Courtesy Hanif Panni, @hanifwondir.</p></div>
<p><span>The artist is being invited to paint other boat murals for other homeowners, he said. While he’s grateful for the offers of work, he’s a bit hesitant to be typecast. “I do some wild stuff and I’ve been at it for a long time,” he said.</span></p>

<p><span>As makes sense for someone with an art background, Hanif’s work fits nicely into art-historical traditions. One, it is an example of trompe-l’oeil painting (French for “to fool the eye”), a tradition that stretches as far back as classical Greece. The tale goes that one artist, Zeuxis, painted a still life so convincing that birds came to peck at the grapes; his rival, Parrhasius, then invited Zeuxis to his studio to look at a painting hanging behind a curtain, but when Zeuxis went to pull it back, it was revealed to be a trick, and Parrhasius won the contest.</span></p>
<p><span>Hanif’s work also echoes the great tradition of nautical painting, which also stretches back to ancient times and includes works by artists like <a href="https://news.artnet.com/art-world/winslow-homer-crosscurrents-at-the-met-2097285" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Winslow Homer</a>, Fitz Hugh Lane, and J.M.W. Turner. On top of it all, there’s the fact that Etienne Constable shares a surname with English painter <a href="https://news.artnet.com/market/constable-painting-sold-2367375" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John Constable</a>. If the latter had painted nautical scenes or trompe-l’oeil works, well, that would have been a hat trick for art history nerds.</span></p>
<p><span>“There are a lot of Easter eggs,” Hanif acknowledged.</span></p>
<p><span>“I appreciate the conversations this thing is spawning,” he said. “It’s the reason I do public art—to get people to have these conversations and have it branch into something that it wasn’t before.”</span></p>

							<p>A time travel paradox in the title is a good place to start a blog post, don’t you think? You don’t yet know the things you need to know so you can’t wish you didn’t need to know them. There is a solution though – Read this blog post.</p>
<p>This all started because Plerion is trying to build a comprehensive risk model for the most severe data breaches occurring in AWS environments. At the top of the list is unauthorised access to S3 buckets. <a href="https://www.techradar.com/pro/security/decathlon-employee-data-leaked-online-following-breach">Here</a> <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/12/20/mcgraw_hills_s3_buckets_exposed/">are</a> <a href="https://www.darkreading.com/application-security/cloud-misconfig-exposes-3tb-sensitive-airport-data-amazon-s3-bucket">some</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/14/bmw-security-lapse-exposed-sensitive-company-information-researcher-finds/">examples</a> in the media.</p>
<p>As with many things AWS security, the more one digs into the details the more oddities one discovers. None of these oddities are <em>new</em> but they all get regularly rediscovered with great surprise. I thought I’d make a list to maybe lessen the surprise for people in the future, and probably future me as well.</p>

<h2 id="S3-buckets-are-the-S3-API">S3 buckets are the S3 API</h2>
<p>Amazon S3 was one of the first services released by AWS so its incredibly robust and well tested. It also means it has a history predating standardised design patterns, resulting in a quirky API relative to other services.</p>
<p>One of those quirks is that a relatively small part of the API requires HTTP requests to be sent to generic S3 endpoints (such as <code>s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com</code>), while the vast majority of requests must be sent to the URL of a target bucket. Under the hood it might all be the same but at least to the caller, this is how it works.</p>
<p>For example, to list the contents of a bucket, the HTTP request looks something like:</p>						</div>
				<div data-id="02b6c75" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="code-highlight.default">
			<pre data-line="">				<code readonly="true">
					<xmp>GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: [bucketname].s3.amazonaws.com</xmp>
				</code>
			</pre>
		</div>
				<div data-id="4a79a4b" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default">
				<p>To get the tags associated with a bucket:</p>
				</div>
				<div data-id="ee597cc" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="code-highlight.default">
			<pre data-line="">				<code readonly="true">
					<xmp>GET /?tagging HTTP/1.1
Host: [bucketname].s3.amazonaws.com
...auth headers...</xmp>
				</code>
			</pre>
		</div>
				<div data-id="b080800" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default">
							<p>S3 isn’t the only service that works this way, Hosted Cognito UI endpoints do something similar (<code>https://[your-user-pool-domain]/login</code>).</p>
<p>The majority of services use a generic endpoint. To get the attributes of an EC2 instance, the API endpoint is something like <code>https://ec2.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/</code>, or to query a DynamoDB table, the API endpoint is <code>https://dynamodb.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/</code>. The target resources are typically passed as HTTP headers or parameters rather than through the host.</p>
<p>Because S3 buckets can be both public (accessed without authentication) as well as private (requiring authentication), it’s not always clear which API operations can be used in which way. Sometimes, you have to use the authenticated CLI (or make artisanal custom authenticated requests), and sometimes, you can just make a simple cURL request.</p>
<p>This doesn’t sound sketchy until you start playing stupid games with it. The whole idea broke my personal mental model that all AWS API requests must be authenticated.</p>
<p>This is all a bit abstract, so imagine you were a naughty little admin and put the policy below on a bucket. It’s obviously a bad idea, so don’t actually do it.</p>
						</div>
				<div data-id="ef29521" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="code-highlight.default">
			<pre data-line="">				<code readonly="true">

            "Action": "s3:*",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::{bucket_name}"
        }

		</div>
				<div data-id="b68eec3" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default">
				<p>This policy says everyone can perform all S3 operations against a given bucket. I personally hadn’t internalized what this means in practice. And what it means is that the below request actually does delete a bucket. No authentication is required.</p>

							<p>Can you think of a genuine use case for this?</p>
<p>In recent years, AWS has done a stellar job confiscating foot guns they previously distributed. Today I just expect this kind of thing not to be possible. It’s even weirder because some S3 operations appear to be footgunless.</p>						</div>

							<p>If you’re bored one day, make a test bucket and navigate to some of these in your browser:</p>

<ul>
    <li>

    </li>
    <li>
    <p>https://[bucketname].s3.amazonaws.com/?tagging</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>https://[bucketname].s3.amazonaws.com/?encryption</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>The documentation for some operations is still online, but it’s no longer possible to execute them (e.g. <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetObjectTorrent.html">GetObjectTorrent</a>).</p>

<h2 id="ListObjects-is-not-the-only-way-to-get-object-keys">ListObjects is not the only way to get object keys</h2>
<p>There are some people in this world who enjoy crimes. Sometimes, those people stumble upon a juicy-looking S3 bucket. They want to download all of its contents but cannot because they need to supply the key of each object, which is like a file path, to download all the objects.</p>
<p>Some crimes are simple. A GET request to the root of a bucket will return a full list of its contents. Therefore, it might appear that denying the <code>s3:ListBucket</code> operation might be a good way to prevent crimes. It works in the sense that a GET request to the root of a bucket will no longer return a full list of its contents.</p>
<p>To make this more real, consider a bucket with a <code>public-read</code> ACL but with a deny <code>s3:ListBucket</code> policy. It’s a bit of an edge case since ACLs are off by default these days, and AWS encourages the use of policies only, but stay with me. In this scenario, there are still at least two ways to get object keys</p>

<ul>
    <li>
<p>GET /?versions – AKA <code>s3:ListBucketVersions</code> – Returns metadata about all versions of the objects in a bucket.</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>GET /?uploads – AKA <code>s3:ListMultipartUploads</code> – This operation lists in-progress multipart uploads in a bucket. An in-progress multipart upload is an object upload that has been initiated by a <code>s3:CreateMultipartUpload</code> request, but has not yet been completed or aborted. In-progress uploads eventually get finished and become regular objects.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Some documentation around this is a little bit sketchy. For example, the <a href="https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/s3api/head-bucket.html">HeadBucket reference states</a>:</p>
						</div>
				<div data-id="9089205" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="image.default">

				</div>
				<div data-id="7336a6e" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default">
							<p>This is incorrect or at least incomplete. The HeadBucket operation just checks if you have access to perform the ListBucket operation.</p>
<p>It’s clarified a bit later in the document:</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
    <li>
<p><strong>General purpose bucket permissions</strong> – To use this operation, you must have permissions to perform the <code>s3:ListBucket</code> action. The bucket owner has this permission by default and can grant this permission to others. For more information about permissions, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-access-control.html">Managing access permissions to your Amazon S3 resources</a> in the <em>Amazon S3 User Guide</em> .</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The point is, don’t rely on validating only that ListBucket is denied. We made that mistake in the first versions of our product.</p>

							<p>The title of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws-cloud-financial-management/discovering-and-deleting-incomplete-multipart-uploads-to-lower-amazon-s3-costs/">this AWS article</a> is a clue as to why that might be annoying.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If the complete multipart upload request isn’t sent successfully, Amazon S3 will not assemble the parts and will not create any object. The parts remain in your Amazon S3 account until the multipart upload completes or is aborted, and you pay for the parts that are stored in Amazon S3.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I couldn’t figure out a way to download parts of not-yet-completed objects, but it’s certainly possible to delete them. AWS recommends applying a lifecycle rule to delete unfinished uploads after a number of days.</p>

<p>Once upon a time in AWS history, AWS accounts were identified not just by their ID but also by the email registered as the root user. Archaeologists have discovered references to emails scattered all over S3 ACL documentation. <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/acl-overview.html">ACLs</a> are a wild ride.</p>
<p>One of those ancient references is in the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutBucketAcl.html">PutBucketACL operation</a>, which allows the grantee to be specified by “the person’s ID”, otherwise known as their email address. A side effect of this is that it’s possible to determine if a given email address has a registered AWS account.</p>

<p>Each object in Amazon S3 has a storage class associated with it. A storage class defines the underlying performance characteristics of object operations. It’s pretty awesome. You can pay Amazon more for frequently accessed objects that need to travel at warp speed, or pay less for infrequently accessed objects that you might only need in the event of disaster recovery.</p>
<p>When reading the above it’s easy to miss that the storage class applies to objects rather than buckets. There’s no way to configure a bucket with the storage class you want.

							<p>It’s also possible to set a lifecycle policy that transitions all objects to a given storage class after a period of time.</p>
<p>Some more good news is that a common way to allow uploads from somewhat untrusted sources is to use pre-signed URLs. The AWS Signature Version 4 mechanism requires that all headers starting with <code>X-Amz-</code> be signed. Storage class is specified via the <code>x-amz-storage-class</code> header, and so there’s no immediately obvious way to manipulate it unless an application does something truly horrible.</p>

							<p>In isolation this is not a problem but it can quickly become a problem if an application expects files uploaded to S3 to be case insensitive. Allow me a moment to present a contrived example.</p>
<p>Imagine an application where user passwords are stored in files in S3. Each user has their own file named after their username. The sign up process just checks the existence of the file in the s3 bucket. If the file exists the new user can’t sign up with the supplied username. Given that S3 keys are not case sensitive, if “jeff” already has an account, someone can still register “JEFF”.</p>
<p>The real problem is in the password update function of the pretend application. Here, the application converts the user’s username to lower case before writing to their file in the S3 bucket. A bad hacker person can login in as “JEFF” because that’s what they signed up as, update their password (that’s not really theirs), and login in as “jeff” because they just set the other Jeff’s password.</p>
<p>It’s contrived, but bug bounties pay out many dollars for these kinds of issues every year.</p>
<p>There’s even more to worry about. Although object keys look and feel like filenames, they actually don’t behave like files in many ways. <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-keys.html">Here’s one</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You can use any UTF-8 character in an object key name. However, using certain characters in key names can cause problems with some applications and protocols.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Try it out for yourself. You’ll see that spaces, slashes, percentage characters, and many others are valid in object keys. If you try to be clever and use a dot in a key, AWS has this advice:</p>						</div>

<p>Back to the origin story of this post – sometimes a bucket is public even if it isn’t public. Know what I mean? Even if your ACLs are turned off, <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetBucketPolicyStatus.html">resource policy is tightly scoped</a>, and block public access is enabled, there are ways to make a bucket publicly accessible.</p>
<p>The most common way is with an Amazon CloudFront distribution. Generally if you’re putting a content delivery network in front of an S3 bucket, you probably intend to deliver the content to the internet. However, if there’s one thing we’ve learned from endless S3 data breaches it’s that intent does not always match reality. This is especially true when most security tools will proclaim with confidence that such a bucket is not public.</p>
<p>If a bucket is exposed via Cloudfront, the resource policy will typically be restricted to just Cloudfront and will therefore be flagged as non public.</p>						</div>

							<p>Another <a href="https://dev.to/aws-builders/your-s3-objects-could-be-public-even-though-the-aws-console-doesnt-say-so-4dcl">fun way</a> to expose a bucket with a restricted resource policy is with Cognito identity pools.</p>
<p>AWS Cognito is a user directory and authentication service. It allows developers to quickly create an authentication experience for an app. Cognito is no different to your favourite AWS services – it is also wildly complicated. However, the thing that matters here is that at the end of a successful login sequence, the user gets temporary AWS credentials for a pre-configured role.</p>
<p>That role has its own permissions and can be used inside resource policies. For example, you could allow the role to <code>s3:ListBucket</code> and <code>s3:GetObject</code> a target bucket. Because the user gets temporary AWS credentials, they can then call those APIs successfully. Again, it doesn’t matter if public access is disabled because the specific identity within the account is allowed.</p>
<p>So how do you successfully login? Since I’m claiming this is public access, there are two Cognito configuration options that matter:</p>

<ol>
    <li>
<p>Self-registration – This is exactly what it sounds like. It allows a user to sign up to an app through a typical registration process. If anyone on the internet can sign up and then sign in, that’s effectively public access.</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>Guest access – This provides a unique identifier and AWS credentials for unauthenticated users. Everything else is the same except the user doesn’t need to complete authentication.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Configuring Cognito is a blog post all of it’s own, but as an example guest access comes down to this series of API calls.</p>						</div>

        <p><strong>See it live:</strong> The demo described in this post will be displayed live at the <a href="https://my.avnet.com/ebv/">EBV Elektronik</a> booth at <a href="https://www.embedded-world.de/">Embedded World 2024</a>
on April 9-11. I’ll be attending too, so get in touch if you’re keen to meet up.
</p>

<p>Over the last few months I’ve been lucky to work with two very talented people on an interesting project for multi-camera machine
vision applications: <a href="https://www.hackster.io/gianluca-filippini">Gianluca Filippini</a> and <a href="https://www.hackster.io/AlbertaBeef">Mario Bergeron</a>.
Back in 2022, I was contacted by Gianluca, an engineer from <a href="https://my.avnet.com/ebv/">EBV Elektronik</a>.
He was using our <a href="https://fpgadrive.com/">FPGA Drive FMC</a>, an adapter for connecting Solid-state drives to FPGAs - but he wasn’t interested in
SSDs. He wanted to use it for a new and exciting AI accelerator from a company called <a href="https://hailo.ai/">Hailo</a>. The idea was to
take the Zynq UltraScale+, a powerful MPSoC geared for video applications, and arm it with a <a href="https://hailo.ai/products/ai-accelerators/hailo-8-ai-accelerator/">top performing AI
accelerator</a> to run intelligent vision algorithms on the edge.</p>
<p>It made a lot of sense. If you’ve had any experience with the
AMD Xilinx <a href="https://docs.xilinx.com/r/1.2-English/ug1414-vitis-ai/Deep-Learning-Processor-Unit-DPU">Deep Learning Processor Unit (DPU)</a>, then you know
about the challenges of putting a neural network in the FPGA. If you haven’t used the DPU then let me spoil the punchline: The DPU consumes a tonne of
FPGA resources and the performance is a little disappointing. With the current solutions on offer, it seems that implementing a neural network in the FPGA
fabric is not the way to get the most bang for your buck. A better solution is to externalize the
neural network and reserve the valuable FPGA resources for something it does spectacularly: image processing. The <a href="https://hailo.ai/products/ai-accelerators/hailo-8-m2-ai-acceleration-module/">Hailo-8</a> is a perfect fit; an external AI accelerator with
a high-throughput PCIe interface that runs AI models way faster than any FPGA-based solution, while also being more power efficient.</p>
<p>Months passed. I launched the
<a href="https://camerafmc.com/docs/rpi-camera-fmc/overview/">RPi Camera FMC</a> and Gianluca contacted me again. This time he wanted to run
YOLOv5 on 4x Raspberry Pi cameras simultaneously, accelerated by the <a href="https://hailo.ai/products/ai-accelerators/hailo-8-m2-ai-acceleration-module/">Hailo-8</a>.
This sounded like fun, so I had to get involved.
Over the next few months we worked between continents to build the demo that I’ll be describing in this post. We teamed up with embedded vision and machine learning expert Mario Bergeron,
who was already working on <a href="https://www.hackster.io/AlbertaBeef/supercharge-your-zuboard-with-the-hailo-8-ai-accelerator-79dd76">pairing the Hailo-8 with the ZUBoard</a>.
I learned heaps and had a lot of fun working with these guys. In the end, I hope we’ve created not only a great demo, but also a useful reference
platform for others who want to build similar systems. In this post I’m providing a detailed description of the design and instructions for building
and running it. I’ve also described any hurdles that we went through, and any lessons learned.</p>
<p><strong>Want to try it?</strong> If you’ve got the required hardware and you want to test this for yourself, you can

</p>

<h2 id="architecture">Architecture</h2>
<p>The architecture of this system involves the following main elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>4x Raspberry Pi cameras each with an independent MIPI capture pipeline that writes to the DDR</li>
<li>Video Mixer based display pipeline that writes to the DisplayPort live interface of the ZynqMP</li>
<li>PCIe root port for interfacing with the Hailo-8</li>
<li>Image processing accelerator (VVAS MultiScaler)</li>
<li>Video Codec Unit (VCU)</li>
</ul>
<p>The block diagram below illustrates the key elements of this design and their interconnections.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.fpgadeveloper.com/multi-camera-yolov5-on-zynq-ultrascale-with-hailo-8-ai-acceleration/images/zynqmp-hailo-ai-arch.png" alt="ZynqMP Hailo-8 hardware architecture"></p>
<h2 id="capture-pipelines">Capture pipelines</h2>
<p>There are four main capture/input pipelines in this design, one for each of the 4x Raspberry Pi cameras. Note that it is also possible to connect
USB cameras and/or IP cameras to this design, but I’ll leave that for another post. The capture pipelines are composed of the following IP, implemented in the PL of the Zynq UltraScale+:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.xilinx.com/r/en-US/pg232-mipi-csi2-rx">MIPI CSI-2 Receiver Subsystem IP</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Xilinx/Vitis_Libraries/tree/main/vision/L3/examples/isppipeline">ISP Pipeline of the Vitis Libraries</a></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.xilinx.com/r/en-US/pg231-v-proc-ss">Video Processing Subsystem IP</a></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.xilinx.com/r/en-US/pg278-v-frmbuf">Frame Buffer Write IP</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The MIPI CSI-2 RX IP is the front of the pipeline and receives image frames from the Raspberry Pi camera over the 2-lane MIPI interface.
The MIPI IP generates an AXI-Streaming output of the frames in RAW10 format. The ISP Pipeline IP performs BPC (Bad Pixel Correction),
gain control, demosaicing and auto white balance, to output the image frames in RGB888 format. The Video Processing Subsystem IP performs
scaling and color space conversion (when needed). The Frame Buffer Write IP then writes the frame data to memory (DDR).
The image below illustrates the MIPI pipeline.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.fpgadeveloper.com/multi-camera-yolov5-on-zynq-ultrascale-with-hailo-8-ai-acceleration/images/zynqmp-hailo-ai-mipi.png" alt="ZynqMP Hailo-8 MIPI pipeline"></p>
<h2 id="display-pipeline">Display pipeline</h2>
<p>The display pipeline reads frames from memory (DDR) and sends them to the monitor. As this is a multi-camera design, and we
would like to display all four video streams on the monitor at the same time, the display pipeline needs to have the ability
to combine the four video streams into one. To achieve this, we used the <a href="https://docs.xilinx.com/r/en-US/pg243-v-mix">Video Mixer IP</a>
with four overlay inputs configured as memory mapped AXI4 interfaces - this allows the mixer to read the four video streams from
memory. The Video Mixer requires you to select a single video
format for each input layer, which in this design we selected YUY2 (to this Video Mixer this is YUYV8) . This is the video format
that was used to train the AI model, and by selecting it here we avoid having to add an extra format conversion to the pipeline.
The output of the mixer is set to an AXI-Streaming video interface with YUV 422 format, which is what the DisplayPort live interface
wants to see.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.xilinx.com/r/en-US/pg085-axi4stream-infrastructure/AXI4-Stream-Subset-Converter?tocId=VUGADTVnQ8nDgI86Et2EkA">AXIS Subset Converter</a>
takes the 3-byte output of the Video Mixer and removes the MSB to produce a 2-byte output which is
fed to the <a href="https://docs.xilinx.com/v/u/en-US/pg044_v_axis_vid_out">AXIS to Video Out Converter</a>. The video output is then fed
to the DisplayPort live interface of the Zynq UltraScale+ which is then routed to the monitor.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.fpgadeveloper.com/multi-camera-yolov5-on-zynq-ultrascale-with-hailo-8-ai-acceleration/images/zynqmp-hailo-ai-display.png" alt="ZynqMP Hailo-8 display pipeline"></p>
<p>You might be interested to know that before using this display pipeline, we started this design using a different one. The original
display pipeline used the <a href="https://xilinx.github.io/VVAS/2.0/build/html/docs/common/Acceleration-Hardware.html#multiscaler-kernel">VVAS Multi-scaler kernel</a>
to combine the four video streams into one. This was
done with the <a href="https://xilinx.github.io/VVAS/2.0/build/html/docs/common/common_plugins.html#vvas-xcompositor">vvas-xcompositor GStreamer plugin</a>.
The Multi-scaler kernel would read the four 720p video streams from memory. It would combine the four video streams
into a single 2K video (in the FPGA fabric) and then write that 2K video back to memory. The combined video would then be read back from memory by the hardened DisplayPort
interface module and sent to the monitor. This display pipeline worked well, but it turned out to be a bottleneck on performance due to the
extra load it created on the DDR interface. By switching to the Video Mixer based pipeline (shown above), we are no longer writing the combined 2K video
to memory and reading it back for display. Instead, the combined video is kept in the FPGA fabric all the way to the DisplayPort live interface.</p>
<h2 id="vvas-accelerator">VVAS Accelerator</h2>
<p>We also added the <a href="https://xilinx.github.io/VVAS/2.0/build/html/docs/common/Acceleration-Hardware.html#multiscaler-kernel">VVAS Multi-scaler kernel</a>
to this design as a Vitis overlay. The kernel enables hardware accelerated resizing, color space conversion, combining of video frames and more.
The accelerator can be exploited through a set of <a href="https://xilinx.github.io/VVAS/2.0/build/html/docs/common/common_plugins.html">GStreamer plug-ins</a>
that you can access in PetaLinux through the installed VVAS packages.</p>
<p>Based on our experience with GStreamer on the Zynq UltraScale+, at any substantial resolution and frame rate, it is essential to use hardware acceleration
to perform all resizing, color conversions and any other image processing. That is to say, the APU (processor) of the Zynq UltraScale+ generally does not
perform well when it is used to do any of this kind of image processing at a useful frame rate and resolution. To make this clear, let me share
numbers from some of the benchmarking done by Mario Bergeron:</p>

<ul>
<li>CSC: Color space conversion</li>
</ul>
<p>When the CPU performs the scaling and color space conversion, we see a huge drop in performance. If we were to look at the CPU usage for those cases, we would
see close to 100% on all cores. When instead the scaling and color space conversion is hardware accelerated with VVAS, we see that frame rates only slightly drop - and
if we configured the kernel for a higher throughput (PPC) I’m confident that we wouldn’t see any drop for those operations at those frame rates and resolutions.</p>
<p>To make this a truly powerful reference
platform, we included the VVAS Multi-scaler kernel into this design, even though it is not used by the actual Hailo-8 demo script. I’ll include some demo
scripts to exploit the VVAS accelerator at a later time.</p>
<h2 id="vcu">VCU</h2>
<p>The Zynq UltraScale+ contains a hardened <a href="https://xilinx-wiki.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/A/pages/18842546/Xilinx+Zynq+UltraScale+MPSoC+Video+Codec+Unit">Video Codec Unit</a>
(VCU) that can be used to perform video encoding and decoding of multiple video standards. The VCU makes the Zynq UltraScale+ a real monster for video
applications, and it’s a hardened block so we couldn’t <em>not</em> put it in the design. Like the VVAS accelerator, we don’t actually
use the VCU in the Hailo-8 demo script, but it’s there to enable applications such as video streaming over the internet or decoding
video streams from sources such as IP cameras. I will include some demo scripts to exploit the VCU at a later time.</p>
<h2 id="hailo-8-pipeline">Hailo-8 pipeline</h2>
<p>In this design, the Hailo-8 AI accelerator connects to the Zynq UltraScale+ through a single lane PCIe interface. To implement the
PCIe root complex, we used the <a href="https://docs.xilinx.com/r/en-US/pg195-pcie-dma">DMA/Bridge Subsystem for PCI Express IP</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.fpgadeveloper.com/multi-camera-yolov5-on-zynq-ultrascale-with-hailo-8-ai-acceleration/images/zynqmp-hailo-ai-hailo.png" alt="ZynqMP Hailo-8 PCIe pipeline"></p>
<p>The PetaLinux projects in this design include the recipes for various Hailo software packages including the
<a href="https://github.com/hailo-ai/hailort-drivers">PCIe driver</a> and <a href="https://github.com/hailo-ai/tappas">Hailo TAPPAS</a>. The beautiful thing
about the Hailo-8 AI accelerator is that <a href="https://hailo.ai/">Hailo</a> has provided all of the drivers and software required. It’s seamlessly
integrated with GStreamer so once you have your model, it’s super easy to get it running.</p>
<h2 id="end-to-end-pipeline">End-to-end pipeline</h2>
<p>The best way to understand what’s happening under the hood of this system is to look at the end-to-end pipeline. The diagram below
illustrates the flow of image frames from the source (Raspberry Pi cameras) to the sink (DP monitor). At each interface, I’ve labelled the pixel format
and the resolution of the frames going through. By the way, a diagram like this is also very useful for spotting bottlenecks - notice how many times the images have
to be written to memory and read back, and the throughput that requires.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.fpgadeveloper.com/multi-camera-yolov5-on-zynq-ultrascale-with-hailo-8-ai-acceleration/images/zynqmp-hailo-ai-end-to-end.png" alt="ZynqMP Hailo-8 end-to-end pipeline"></p>
<p>Here is a description of the flow of image frames through the system:</p>
<ol>
<li>The RPi cameras are configured to output 1080p images at 30 fps</li>
<li>The MIPI CSI2 RX IPs output RAW10 1080p</li>
<li>The ISP Pipeline IPs output RBG888 1080p</li>
<li>The Video Processing Subsystem IPs scale down the images to 720p YUY2 format, which is the resolution and format for which our AI model has been trained</li>
<li>The Hailo-8 reads the 4x video streams from the DDR via PCIe and outputs the detection metadata: bounding box coordinates, object classes and confidence
levels</li>
<li>The CPU buffers the 4x video streams, and uses the detection metadata to overlay the bounding boxes</li>
<li>The Video Mixer reads the 4x 720p video streams, combines them into a single 2K video stream and drives the DisplayPort live interface with the result</li>
</ol>
<p>If you’ve used Raspberry Pi cameras before, you might know that the IMX219 image sensor can support 720p natively. So why then are we requesting 1080p
from the cameras, only to scale them down to 720p with the Video Processing Subsystem? The reason is that
the <a href="https://github.com/Xilinx/linux-xlnx/blob/master/drivers/media/i2c/imx219.c">Linux driver for IMX219</a> does not support 720p resolution (not yet anyway),
so we have to start at 1080p and scale down to the resolution that our AI model was trained for.</p>

<p>To see the best performance of this demo, you should use a monitor with a resolution of at least 2560x1440. This resolution allows the four 720p
video streams to be displayed in the four quadrants of the monitor without any scaling. You can use either a DisplayPort monitor, or a HDMI monitor
with DisplayPort-to-HDMI adapter. If you decide to use a DisplayPort-to-HDMI adapter, be aware that the majority of adapters I tested <strong>did
not work</strong> with the ZCU106. AMD Xilinx is <a href="https://support.xilinx.com/s/question/0D52E00006iHmNkSAK/display-port-to-hdmi-adapters-do-not-work-at-zcu106-board?language=en_US">aware of this issue</a>
but at the time of writing this they have not provided a list of recommended adapters. I have named and linked below to the adapter that I found
to work. I have no affiliation with the company that makes the adapter or the monitor.</p>

<h2 id="power-supply-adjustments">Power supply adjustments</h2>
<p>In this project we use the <a href="https://camerafmc.com/docs/rpi-camera-fmc/overview/">RPi Camera FMC</a> and the <a href="https://www.fpgadrive.com/docs/fpga-drive-fmc-gen4/overview/">FPGA Drive FMC Gen4</a>, both connected to the FMC connectors on the <a href="https://www.xilinx.com/zcu106">ZCU106</a>. Each of these boards have
different VADJ working ranges, as shown in the table below:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>FMC</th>
<th>VADJ</th>
<th>ZCU106 connector</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>RPi Camera FMC</td>
<td>1.2V</td>
<td>HPC0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>FPGA Drive FMC Gen4</td>
<td>1.2-3.3V</td>
<td>HPC1</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Both FMC boards have an EEPROM that is programmed with it’s specific voltage requirements, and the ZCU106 board is designed to read those EEPROMs
and settle on a voltage that they both can accept: 1.2VDC. In order to ensure that this process runs smoothly, there are two things that need to be
corrected first:</p>
<ol>
<li>Update the EEPROM binary of the FPGA Drive FMC Gen4</li>
<li>Adjust the fault limit of one of the voltage regulators on the ZCU106</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="1-eeprom-binary-update">1. EEPROM binary update</h2>
<p>If you are using FPGA Drive FMC Gen4 (OP063) with serial number in the range of 630000 to 630209, you will need to update it’s EEPROM contents with the
latest binary. This can be done using the latest <a href="https://www.fpgadrive.com/docs/fpga-drive-fmc-gen4/programming/#fmc-eeprom-tool">Opsero FMC EEPROM Tool</a>.
These earlier units were programmed to accept a voltage of 1.8V only. The update ensures that the FMC card will accept a voltage between 1.2V and 3.3V,
which is the entire operable range of the FMC card.</p>
<h2 id="2-voltage-limit-adjustment">2. Voltage limit adjustment</h2>
<p>We have to do a slight adjustment to one of the power controllers on the ZCU106 in order to allow it to supply a voltage of 1.2V to the FMC cards.
The reason is that the regulator (or more specifically the Digital POL Controller MAX15301, U63) that generates VADJ (the FMC card’s I/O voltage)
was configured by default with a “Power Good ON” limit of 1.511V, meaning that any voltage output below 1.511V would trigger a fault.</p>
<p>To change this limit, you need to do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download and install the <a href="https://www.analog.com/en/resources/evaluation-hardware-and-software/software/software-download.html?swpart=SFW0008830C">Maxim PowerTool software</a>
on your PC</li>
<li>Get access to a Maxim PowerTool (PN:<a href="https://www.digikey.ca/en/products/detail/analog-devices-inc-maxim-integrated/MAXPOWERTOOL002/5086175">MAXPOWERTOOL002#</a>)</li>
<li>Connect the tool to the PMBUS header of the ZCU106 board (shown below)
<img src="https://www.fpgadeveloper.com/multi-camera-yolov5-on-zynq-ultrascale-with-hailo-8-ai-acceleration/images/zynqmp-hailo-ai-1.jpg" alt="PMBUS header"></li>
<li>Connect the tool to a USB port on a Windows machine</li>
<li>Launch the Maxim PowerTool software</li>
<li>Click the tab of the power controller with address <code>0x18</code>
<img src="https://www.fpgadeveloper.com/multi-camera-yolov5-on-zynq-ultrascale-with-hailo-8-ai-acceleration/images/maximtool-instructions-2.png" alt="VADJ tab"></li>
<li>Click the “Faults Set” tab and find the “Power Good ON” fault setting. It should be RED as shown in the image below. Note that the “Vout Under Voltage Fault” might also be
RED, but this one does not affect the VADJ output, so we can leave that one alone (unless you want to fix it)
<img src="https://www.fpgadeveloper.com/multi-camera-yolov5-on-zynq-ultrascale-with-hailo-8-ai-acceleration/images/maximtool-instructions-6.png" alt="Fault Set tab"></li>
<li>Change the “Power Good ON” fault level to 1.15V (below our desired 1.2VDC)
<img src="https://www.fpgadeveloper.com/multi-camera-yolov5-on-zynq-ultrascale-with-hailo-8-ai-acceleration/images/maximtool-instructions-7.png" alt="Power Good ON"></li>
<li>Click on the “Tools” tab as shown below and select the “STORE_USER_ALL” command from the drop-down menu
<img src="https://www.fpgadeveloper.com/multi-camera-yolov5-on-zynq-ultrascale-with-hailo-8-ai-acceleration/images/maximtool-instructions-8.png" alt="Store User ALL"></li>
<li>Click “Write” as shown below
<img src="https://www.fpgadeveloper.com/multi-camera-yolov5-on-zynq-ultrascale-with-hailo-8-ai-acceleration/images/maximtool-instructions-9.png" alt="Write settings"></li>
</ol>
<p>Now when the board is power cycled, and both FMC cards are connected, you should see that VADJ is powered up at 1.2V on both FMC cards. You can test
this quickly by plugging in both FMC cards and powering up the board in JTAG mode (SW6 set to ON-ON-ON-ON). If you see the “POWER” LEDs of both FMC
cards light up, then you’re good to go. Note that the FPGA Drive FMC Gen4 has a RED power LED - don’t confuse this with a fault.</p>
<h2 id="hardware-setup">Hardware setup</h2>
<p>The following instructions will show you how to setup the hardware to be able to run this demo. I suggest you follow the instructions
in the order that they are written.</p>
<h2 id="camera-fmc-setup">Camera FMC setup</h2>
<p>To setup the <a href="https://camerafmc.com/docs/rpi-camera-fmc/overview/">RPi Camera FMC</a>, I suggest that you first attach the 4x RPi cameras as shown in the image below. Make sure that each of the flex cables are
firmly locked into place by pushing in the fastening tabs. Make sure that the blue sides of the flex cables are pointed upwards, just like in the image.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.fpgadeveloper.com/multi-camera-yolov5-on-zynq-ultrascale-with-hailo-8-ai-acceleration/images/zynqmp-hailo-ai-4.jpg" alt="RPi Camera FMC"></p>
<p>Carefully turn over the FMC card and plug it into the HPC0 connector of the ZCU106 board as shown below. I prefer to do it this way because it’s
more of a challenge to attach the cameras once the FMC card is plugged into the carrier.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.fpgadeveloper.com/multi-camera-yolov5-on-zynq-ultrascale-with-hailo-8-ai-acceleration/images/zynqmp-hailo-ai-5.jpg" alt="RPi Camera FMC"></p>
<h2 id="hailo-8-setup">Hailo-8 setup</h2>
<p>You will need to attach a heat sink to the Hailo-8. I have used a 20x20x10mm heatsink and an adhesive thermal pad from Digikey:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.digikey.ca/en/products/detail/advanced-thermal-solutions-inc/ATS020020010-SF-7I/18711199">20x20x10mm heatsink PN:ATS020020010-SF-7I</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.digikey.ca/en/products/detail/3m-tc/19MM-19MM-10-8810/2649858">19x19mm Adhesive thermal pad</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Insert the Hailo-8 module into slot 1 (J2) of the <a href="https://www.fpgadrive.com/docs/fpga-drive-fmc-gen4/overview/">FPGA Drive FMC Gen4</a> as shown below.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.fpgadeveloper.com/multi-camera-yolov5-on-zynq-ultrascale-with-hailo-8-ai-acceleration/images/zynqmp-hailo-ai-6.jpg" alt="Hailo-8 and FPGA Drive FMC Gen4"></p>
<p>Carefully plug the FMC card into the HPC1 connector of the ZCU106 board as shown below. When doing this, make sure that you support the ZCU106
board from the underside while you apply downward pressure on the FMC card. You don’t want the ZCU106 PCB to bend as you apply pressure.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.fpgadeveloper.com/multi-camera-yolov5-on-zynq-ultrascale-with-hailo-8-ai-acceleration/images/zynqmp-hailo-ai-7.jpg" alt="ZCU106 HPC0 and HPC1 loaded"></p>
<h2 id="remaining-connections">Remaining connections</h2>
<p>Make the following remaining connections to the ZCU106 board:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Connect the DisplayPort monitor (or HDMI monitor with DP-to-HDMI adapter as in our case)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Connect the USB-UART port to your computer (we use it as a PetaLinux terminal)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Connect the power supply</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Optional: Connect the Ethernet port to your network router if you need network connectivity for SSH access or anything else</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The resulting setup should look like this.</p>

<h2 id="build-instructions">Build instructions</h2>
<p>As this project is built on PetaLinux, you will need a Linux machine to build it. The machine should have the following tools installed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vivado 2022.1</li>
<li>Vitis 2022.1</li>
<li>PetaLinux 2022.1</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>No time?</strong> If you prefer to skip the build process, you can download the pre-built boot files
<a href="https://download.opsero.com/boot/2022-1/zynqmp-hailo-ai_zcu106_petalinux-2022-1.zip">here</a> or you can
download the disk image <a href="https://download.opsero.com/boot/2022-1/zynqmp-hailo-ai-zcu106-2022-1.zip">here</a>.
</p>

<p>The source code for this design is managed in a <a href="https://github.com/fpgadeveloper/zynqmp-hailo-ai">Github repo</a>.
The repo contains submodules so remember to use the <code>--recursive</code> option when cloning. To clone the repo, run:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="fallback">git clone --recursive https://github.com/fpgadeveloper/zynqmp-hailo-ai.git
</code></pre></div><p>Then source the Vivado and PetaLinux tools:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="fallback">source &lt;path-to-petalinux&gt;/2022.1/settings.sh
source &lt;path-to-vivado&gt;/2022.1/settings64.sh
</code></pre></div><p>To build all parts of the project, including Vivado project, accelerator kernel and PetaLinux, run the following:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="fallback">cd zynqmp-hailo-ai/PetaLinux
make petalinux TARGET=zcu106
</code></pre></div><p>The whole build process takes a couple hours on a good machine.</p>
<h2 id="prepare-the-sd-card">Prepare the SD card</h2>
<p>The PetaLinux project that we just built is configured to boot from the SD card, and to store the root filesystem on
the SD card. So we need to create two partitions on the SD card: one for the boot files and another for the root file system.
We then need to copy the boot files and root file system to the corresponding partitions.</p>
<ol>
<li>Plug the SD card into your computer and find it’s device name using the <code>dmesg</code> command. The SD card should be found at the
end of the log, and it’s device name should be something like <code>/dev/sdX</code>, where <code>X</code> is a letter such as a,b,c,d, etc. Note that
you should replace the <code>X</code> in the following instructions.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>WARNING:</strong> If you cannot find the SD card’s device name, or you are not quite sure, do NOT proceed with the following steps because
you might choose the wrong disk (eg. your PC’s hard drive) and completely mess it up. Only follow the next steps when you are
absolutely sure that you have the device name of the SD card.
</p>

<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>Run <code>fdisk</code> by typing the command (replace <code>sdX</code> with the correct device name):</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make the <code>boot</code> partition: type <code>n</code> to create a new partition, then type <code>p</code> to make it primary, then use the default
partition number and first sector. For the last sector, type <code>+1G</code> to allocate 1GB to this partition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make the <code>boot</code> partition bootable by typing <code>a</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make the <code>root</code> partition: typing <code>n</code> to create a new partition, then type <code>p</code> to make it primary, then use the default
partition number, first sector and last sector.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Save the partition table by typing <code>w</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Format the <code>boot</code> partition (FAT32) by typing:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash">sudo mkfs.vfat -F <span>32</span> -n boot /dev/sdX1
</code></pre></div></li>
<li>
<p>Format the <code>root</code> partition (ext4) by typing:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash">sudo mkfs.ext4 -L root /dev/sdX2
</code></pre></div></li>
<li>
<p>Copy the boot files to the <code>boot</code> partition of the SD
card: Assuming the boot partition was mounted to <code>/media/user/boot</code>, follow these instructions:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span>cd</span> /media/user/boot/
sudo cp &lt;git-repo-path&gt;/PetaLinux/zcu106/images/linux/BOOT.BIN .
sudo cp &lt;git-repo-path&gt;/PetaLinux/zcu106/images/linux/boot.scr .
sudo cp &lt;git-repo-path&gt;/PetaLinux/zcu106/images/linux/image.ub .
sudo cp &lt;git-repo-path&gt;/VitisAccel/zcu106_container/dpu.xclbin .
</code></pre></div><p>If you’re using the pre-built boot files, the relevant files are in the <code>boot</code> folder; just copy them over.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create the root file system by extracting the <code>rootfs.tar.gz</code> file to the root partition. Assuming the root partition was
mounted to <code>/media/user/root</code>, follow these instructions:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span>cd</span> /media/user/root/
sudo cp &lt;git-repo-path&gt;/PetaLinux/zcu106/images/linux/rootfs.tar.gz .
sudo tar xvf rootfs.tar.gz -C .
sync
</code></pre></div><p>If you’re using the pre-built boot files, the <code>rootfs.tar.gz</code> file is in the <code>root</code> folder, so just copy it over
and extract it.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Once the sync command returns, you will be able to eject the SD card from the machine and plug it into the ZCU106.</p>
<h2 id="launch-instructions">Launch instructions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Open up a terminal console such as <a href="https://www.putty.org/">Putty</a> and configure it for the UART port of the ZCU106 board.</li>
<li>Power up the board and wait for the PetaLinux boot sequence to complete.</li>
<li>Login to PetaLinux using the username <code>root</code> and password <code>root</code>.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="display-all-cameras">Display all cameras</h3>
<p>To display all camera video streams on the monitor, run the command <code>displaycams.sh</code>. To end the demo, press <code>Ctrl-C</code>.</p>
<h3 id="run-the-hailo-8-demo">Run the Hailo-8 demo</h3>
<p>To run YOLOv5 on the Hailo-8, and display the results on the monitor, run the command <code>hailodemo.sh</code>. To end the demo, press <code>Ctrl-C</code>.</p>
<p>I’ve filmed the demo running with the four cameras pointed at different sections of a monitor playing a video of some street
scenes. The monitor to the right is displaying the four output video streams with detection results. I filmed the demo in this
way, so that you could get a feeling for the output frame rate and the end-to-end latency.</p>

<p>As I mentioned earlier, this demo will be displayed live at the EBV Elektronik booth at <a href="https://www.embedded-world.de/">Embedded World 2024</a>
on April 9-11. I’ll be there too, so come and say “hi”.</p>
<h2 id="more-to-come">More to come</h2>
<p>You might have noticed that the <a href="https://www.github.com/fpgadeveloper/zynqmp-hailo-ai/">Git repository</a> contains designs for the <a href="https://www.xilinx.com/zcu104">ZCU104</a> and the <a href="https://www.avnet.com/shop/us/products/avnet-engineering-services/aes-zuev-cc-g-3074457345635014226/">Avnet UltraZed-EV Carrier</a> -
both of which only have one FMC connector. To make this possible, I’ve come up with a new and exciting product and a way to get more
out of FMC. I’ll talk more about this in my next post.</p>

              for an overview of some hurdles associated with running traditional fiber to the continent.</p>
            <p><strong><em>I am absolutely not in a position of authority to speculate on the future of Antarctic connectivity!</em></strong>
              Seriously. I was a low-level, seasonal IT worker in a large, complex organization.
              Do not email me your
              ideas for improving Internet access in Antarctica – I am not in a position to do anything with them.</p>
            <p>I do agree with the widespread consensus on the matter: There is <strong>tremendous interest</strong> in
              improving connectivity to US research stations in Antarctica. I would timidly conjecture that, at some point,
              there will be engineering solutions to these problems.
              Improved connectivity will eventually arrive in Antarctica,
              either through enhanced satellite technologies or through the arrival of fiber to the continent.</p>
            <p>But – that world will only exist at some point in the future. Currently, Antarctic connectivity is
              <em>extremely limited</em>. What do I mean by that?</p>
            <p>Until very recently, at McMurdo, nearly <strong>a thousand people</strong>, plus numerous scientific
              projects and operational workloads, all relied on a series of links
              that provided max, aggregate speeds of a few dozen megabits
              per second to the <strong>entire station</strong>.
              For comparison, that’s less bandwidth shared by everyone <strong>combined</strong> than what
              everyone <strong>individually</strong> can get on a typical 4g cellular network in an American suburb.</p>
            <p>Things <strong>are</strong> looking up! The NSF recently
              <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=307974&amp;org=OPP">announced</a> some important developments
              regarding Starlink at McMurdo and Palmer.</p>
            <p>I’m aware that the on-the-ground experience in McMurdo and Palmer is better now than it was even just a year ago.</p>
            <p>But – as of October 2023, the situation was still pretty dire at the South Pole.
              As far as I’m aware, similar developments regarding Starlink have <strong>not</strong> yet been announced for South Pole Station.</p>
            <p>As of October 2023, South Pole had the limitations described above,
              <strong>plus</strong> there was only connectivity for a few hours a day, when the satellites rose above the horizon
              and the station was authorized to use them.
              The satellite schedule generally shifts forward (earlier) by about 4 minutes per day, due to
              the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidereal_time">difference between Sidereal time and Solar (Civil) time</a>.</p>
            <p>The current satellite schedule can be found online, on the
              <a href="https://www.usap.gov/technology/sctnsouthpolesats.cfm">South Pole Satellite Communications</a> page
              of the public USAP.gov website. Here’s an example of the schedule from October 2023:</p>

            </p>
            <p>These small intermittent links to the outside world are shared by <strong>everyone at Pole</strong>, for operational,
              science, and community / morale usage.</p>
            <p>Complicating matters further is the unavoidable physics of this connectivity.
              These satellites are in a high orbit, thousands of miles up. This means high latency. If you’ve used
              a consumer satellite product such as HughesNet or ViaSat, you’ll understand.</p>
            <p>From my berthing room at the South Pole, it was about <strong>750 milliseconds</strong>, round trip,
              for a packet to get to and from a terrestrial US destination.
              This is about <strong>ten times</strong> the latency of a round trip
              between the US East and West coasts (up to 75 ms).
              And it’s about <strong>thirty times</strong> the expected
              latency of a healthy connection from your home, on a terrestrial cable or fiber connection,
              to most major content delivery networks (up to 25 ms).</p>
            <p>Seriously, I can’t emphasize how jarring this is. At my apartment back home, on GPON fiber,
              it’s about 3 ms roundtrip to Fastly, Cloudflare, CloudFront, Akamai, and Google.
              At the South Pole, the latency was over <strong>two hundred and fifty times greater</strong>.</p>
            <p>I can’t go into more depth about how USAP does prioritization, shaping,
              etc, because I’m not authorized to share these details. Suffice to say, if you’re an enterprise network
              engineer used to working in a bandwidth-constrained environment, you’ll feel right at home with the
              equipment, tools, and techniques used to manage Antarctic connectivity.</p>
            <p>Any individual trying to use the Internet for community use at the South Pole, as of October 2023,
              likely faced:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Round-trip latency averaging around 750 milliseconds, with jitter between
                packets sometimes exceeding several seconds.</li>
              <li>Available speeds, to the end-user device, that range from a couple kbps (yes, you read that right),
                up to 2 mbps on a <strong>really good</strong> day.</li>
              <li>Extreme congestion, queueing, and dropped packets, far in excess of even the worst oversaturated ISP links
                or bufferbloat-infested routers back home.</li>
              <li>Limited availability, frequent dropouts, and occasional service preemptions.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These constraints <em>drastically</em> impact the modern web experience! Some of it is unavoidable. The link characteristics
              described above are truly bleak. But – a lot of the end-user
              impact is caused by web and app engineering which fails to take slow/intermittent links
              into consideration.</p>
            <p>If you’re an app developer reading this, can you tell me, off the top of your head, how your app behaves
              on a link with 40 kbps available bandwidth, 1,000 ms latency, occasional jitter of up to 2,000 ms,
              packet loss of 10%, and a complete 15-second connectivity dropout every few minutes?</p>
            <p>It’s probably not great! And yet – these are real-world performance parameters that I encountered,
              under certain conditions, at the South Pole.
              It’s normally better than this, but this does occur, and it occurs often enough
              that it’s worth taking seriously.</p>
            <p>This is what happens when you have a tiny pipe to share among high-priority
              operational needs, plus dozens of community users. Operational needs are aggressively prioritized,
              and the community soaks up whatever is left.</p>
            <p>I’m not expecting miracles here! Obviously no amount of client engineering can make, say, real-time video
              conferencing work under these conditions. But – getting a few bytes of text in and out <strong>should</strong> still be possible!
              I know it is possible, because some apps are still able to do it. Others are not.</p>
            <h2 id="detailed-real-world-example">Detailed, Real-world Example</h2>
            <p>One day at the South Pole, I was trying to load the website of <strong><em>&lt;$enterprise_collaboration_platform&gt;</em></strong>
              in my browser. It’s <em>huge</em>! It needed to load nearly 20 MB of Javascript, <em>just</em> to render the main screen!
              And of course, the app had been updated since last time I loaded it, so all of my browser’s cached assets were
              stale and had to be re-downloaded.</p>
            <p>Fine! It’s slow, but at least it will work… eventually, right? Browsers do a decent job of handling
              slow Internet. Under the hood, the underlying protocols do a decent job at congestion control.
              I should get a steady trickle of data. This will be
              subject to the negotiated send and receive windows between client and server,
              which are based on the current level of congestion on the link, and which are further influenced by any
              shaping done by middleware along the way.</p>
            <p>It’s a complex webapp, so the app developer would also need to implement some
              of their own retry logic. This allows for recovery in the event that individual assets fail,
              especially for those long, multi-second total connectivity dropouts.
              But eventually, given enough time, the transfers should complete.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, this is where things broke down and got really annoying. <em>The developers implemented
                a global failure trigger somewhere in the app.</em>
              If the app didn’t fully load within the parameters specified by the developer
              (time? number of retries? I’m not sure.), then the app
              <strong>stopped, gave up, redirected you to an error page, dropped all the loading progress you’d made, and
                implemented aggressive cache-busting countermeasures for next time you retried.</strong></p>
            <p>

                <em>The app wasn't loading fast enough, and the developers decided that the app should give up instead
                  of continuing to load slowly.</em>
              </a>
            </p>
            <p>I cannot tell you how frustrating this was! Connectivity at the South Pole was never going to meet the
              performance expectations set by engineers using a robust terrestrial Internet connection.
              It’s not a good idea to hardcode a single, static, global expectation for how long
              20 MB of Javascript should take to download.
              Why not let me load it at my own pace? I’ll get there
              when I get there. <em>As long as data is still moving, however slow, just let it run.</em></p>
            <p>But – the developers decided that if the app didn’t load within the parameters they set,
              I couldn’t use it at all.
              And to be clear – this was primarily a <strong>messaging</strong> app. The actual content payload here, when
              the app is running and I’m chatting with my friends, is measured in <em>bytes</em>.</p>
            <p>As it turns out, our Internet performance at the South Pole was  <em>right on the edge</em> of what the app
              developers considered “acceptable”. So, if I kept reloading the page, and if I kept
              letting it re-download the same 20 MB of Javascript, and if I kept putting up with the
              developer’s cache-busting shenanigans, <em>eventually</em> it finished before the artificial failure criteria.</p>
            <p>What this means is that I wasted <em>extra</em> bandwidth doing all these useless reloads, and it took sometimes
              <strong>hours</strong> before I was able to use the app. All of this hassle, even though, if left alone,
              I could complete the necessary data transfer in 15 minutes.
              Several hours (and a shameful amount of retried Javascript) later, I was finally able to send a short,
              text-based message to my friends.</p>

            <p>Does this webapp <strong>really need</strong> to be 20 MB? What all is
              being loaded that could be deferred until it is needed, or included in an “optional” add-on bundle?
              Is there a possibility of a “lite” version, for bandwidth-constrained users?</p>
            <p>In my 14 months in Antarctica, I collected <strong>dozens</strong> of examples of apps like this, with artificial
              constraints built in that rendered them unusable or borderline-unusable.</p>
            <p>For the rest of this post, I’ll outline some of my major frustrations, and what I would have liked
              to see instead that would mitigate the issues.</p>
            <p>I understand that not every app is in a position to implement all of these! If you’re
              a tiny app, just getting off the ground, I don’t expect you to spend all of your development time optimizing
              for weirdos in Antarctica.</p>
            <p>Yes, Antarctica is an edge case! Yes, 750 ms / 10% packet loss / 40 kbps <strong>is</strong> rather extreme.
              But the South Pole was not <strong>uniquely</strong> bad. There are entire commercial marine vessels that rely on older
              <a href="https://www.inmarsat.com/">Inmarsat</a> solutions for a few hundred precious kbps of data while at sea.
              There’s someone at a remote research site deep in the mountains right now, trying to load your app on
              a <a href="https://www.iridium.com/products/thales-missionlink-700/">Thales MissionLink</a> using the Iridium
              Certus network at a few dozen kbps.
              There are folks behind misconfigured routers, folks with flaky
              wifi, folks stuck with fly-by-night WISPs delivering sub-par service. Folks who still use dial-up
              Internet connections over degraded copper phone lines.</p>
            <p>These folks are worthy of your consideration. At the very least, you should make an effort to avoid
              <strong>actively interfering</strong> with their ability to use your products.</p>
            <p>So, without further ado, here are some examples of development patterns that routinely caused me grief at
              the South Pole.</p>
            <h2 id="hardcoded-timeouts-hardcoded-chunk-size">Hardcoded Timeouts, Hardcoded Chunk Size</h2>
            <p>As per the above example, <strong>do not hardcode your assumptions about how long a given payload will take to
                transfer, or how much you can transfer in a single request.</strong></p>
            <ol>
              <li>If you have the ability to measure whether bytes are flowing, and they are, <strong>leave them alone</strong>, no
                matter how slow. Perhaps show some UI indicating what is happening.</li>
              <li>If you are doing an HTTPS call,
                fall back to a longer timeout if the call fails. Maybe it just needs more time under current network
                conditions.</li>
              <li>If you’re having trouble moving large amounts of data in a single HTTPS call, break it up. Divide the
                content into chunks, transfer small chunks at a time, and <strong>diligently keep track of the progress</strong>, to
                allow resuming and retrying small bits without losing all progress so far. Slow, steady,
                incremental progress is better than a one-shot attempt to transfer a huge amount of data.</li>
              <li>If you can’t get an HTTPS call done successfully, do some troubleshooting. Try DNS, ICMP,
                HTTP (without TLS), HTTPS to a known good status endpoint, etc. This information might be helpful
                for troubleshooting, and it’s better than blindly retrying the same end-to-end HTTPS call.
                This HTTPS call requires a bunch of under-the-hood stuff to be working properly. Clearly it’s not,
                so you should make an effort to figure out why and let your user know.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3 id="example-1---in-app-metadata-download">Example 1 - In-App Metadata Download</h3>
            <p>A popular desktop application tries to download some configuration information from the vendor’s website
              at startup. There is a hardcoded timeout for the HTTPS call. <strong>If it fails, the app will not load.</strong> It’ll
              just keep retrying the same call, with the same parameters, forever. It’ll sit on the loading page,
              without telling you what’s wrong. I’ve confirmed this is what’s happening by reading the logs.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Luckily, if you kept trying, the call would eventually make it through under network conditions I
              experienced at the South Pole.</p>
            <p>It’s frustrating
              that just a single hardcoded timeout value, in an otherwise perfectly-functional and enterprise-grade
              application, can render it almost unusable. The developers could have:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Fallen back to increasingly-long timeouts to try and get a successful result.</li>
              <li>Done some connection troubleshooting to infer more about the current network environment, and
                responded accordingly.</li>
              <li>Shown UX explaining what was going on.</li>
              <li>Used a cached or default-value configuration, if it couldn’t get the live one, instead of simply
                refusing to load.</li>
              <li>Provided a mechanism for the user to manually download and install the required data, bypassing the
                app’s built-in (and naive) download logic.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3 id="example-2---chat-apps">Example 2 - Chat Apps</h3>
            <p>A popular chat app (“app #1”) maintains a websocket for sending and receiving data.
              The initialization process for that websocket uses a <strong>hardcoded 10-second timeout</strong>.
              Upon cold boot, when network conditions are especially congested, that websocket setup can sometimes take
              more than 10 seconds! We have to do a full TCP handshake, then set up a TLS session, then set up the
              websocket, then do initial signaling over the websocket.
              Remember – under some conditions, each individual roundtrip at the South Pole took multiple seconds!</p>
            <p>If the 10-second timeout elapses, the app simply does not work. It enters a very long backoff state
              before retrying. The UX does not clearly show what is happening.</p>

                <em>Excerpt from debug log for chat app #1, showing the hardcoded 10-second timeout. We did indeed
                  have Internet access at this time -- it was just too congested to complete an entire TCP handshake +
                  TLS negotiation + websocket setup + request within this timeframe.
                  With a few more seconds, it may have finished.</em>

            </p>
            <p>On the other hand, a competitor’s chat app (“app #2”) does <em>very well</em> in extremely degraded network
              conditions! It has multiple strategies for sending network requests, for resilience against
              certain types of degradation.
              It aggressively re-uses open connections. It dynamically adjusts timeouts.
              In the event of a failure, it intelligently chooses a retry cadence. And, throughout all of this,
              it has clear UX explaining current network state.</p>
            <p>The end result is that I could often use app #2 in network conditions when I could not use app #1. Both of
              them were just transmitting plain text! Just a few actual bytes of
              content! And even when I could not use app #2, it was at least telling
              me what it was trying to do. App #1 is written naively, with baked-in assumptions
              about connectivity that simply did not hold true at the South Pole.
              App #2 is written well, and it responds gracefully to the conditions it encounters in the wild.</p>

            <p>A chance to talk about my own blog publishing toolchain!</p>
            <p>The site you’re reading right now is a static Jekyll blog.
              Assets are stored on S3 and served through CloudFront. I build the static files locally here on my laptop,
              and I upload them directly to S3. Nothing fancy. No servers, no QA environment, no build system,
              no automated hooks, nothing dynamic.</p>
            <p>Given the extreme connectivity constraints at the South Pole,
              I wrote a Python script for publishing to S3 that
              worked well in the challenging environment. It uses the S3 API to upload assets in small chunks.
              It detects and resumes failed uploads without losing progress. It waits until everything is safely uploaded
              before publishing the new version.</p>
            <p>If I can do it, unpaid, working alone, for my silly little hobby blog, in 200 lines of Python…
              surely your team of engineers can do so for your flagship webapp.</p>
            <p>It’s amazing the usability improvements that come along with some proactive engineering. I had friends at Pole
              with blogs on commercial platforms, and who routinely shared large files to social
              media sites. They had
              to carefully time their day to maximize the likelihood of a successful “one-shot” upload, during a
              satellite window, using their platform’s poorly-engineered publishing tools.
              Often it took several retries, and it’s not always clear what was happening at every step of the process
              (Is the content live? Did the upload finish? Is it safe / should I hit “Post” again?).</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, I was able to harvest whatever connectivity I could find.
              I got a few kilobytes uploaded here and there,
              whenever it was convenient. If a particular chunked POST failed, no worries!
              I could retry or resume, with minimal lost progress, at a later time.
              Once it was all done and staged, I could safely publish the new version.</p>

            <p><strong>If you’re going to build in a downloader into your app, you have a high bar for quality that you have
                to meet.</strong> Otherwise, it’s going to fail in profoundly annoying or catastrophic ways.</p>
            <p>If I had to give one piece of advice:
              <strong><em>Let the user break out of your in-app downloader and use their own, if at all possible.</em></strong></p>
            <p>Provide a manual download link, ideally one that leads to whatever differential patch file the app was going
              to download. Don’t punish the user by making them download the full installer, just because your in-app patch
              downloader doesn’t meet their needs.</p>
            <p>This has the following benefits:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>If your downloader fails, the user can still get the file manually, using a more robust downloader
                of their choice, such as a web browser.</li>
              <li>The user can download the file one time, and share it with multiple devices.</li>
              <li>The user can download the file on a different computer than the one running the application.</li>
              <li>The user has the flexibility to schedule or manage the download based on whatever constraints they face.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Why is this all so important when considering users at the South Pole?</strong></p>
            <p>Downloads <strong>are</strong> possible at the South Pole, but they are subject to unique constraints. The biggest
              constraint is the lack of 24x7 Internet. While I was there, I <em>knew</em> we would lose Internet access at a
              certain time!</p>
            <p>It’s a frustrating reality: with most apps that do their own downloads, we were powerless to do
              anything about this known break in connectivity. We just had to sit there and watch it fail, and
              often watch all our progress be lost.</p>
            <p>Let’s say I had a 4-hour window, every day, during which I could do (very slow!!) downloads. If the total
              amount of data I could download in those 4 hours was <strong>less</strong> than the total size of the payload
              I was downloading, then there is <em>no way</em> I could complete the download in one shot!
              I’d <em>have</em> to split it over multiple Internet windows. Often the app wouldn’t let me do so.</p>
            <p>And that’s not even considering the fact that access might be unreliable during that time! What if the
              underlying connection dropped and I had to resume the download? What if my plans changed and I needed
              to pause? I didn’t want to waste whatever precious little progress I’d made so far.</p>
            <p>A lot of modern apps include their own homegrown, artisanal, in-app downloaders for large payloads.
              By “in-app downloader”, I’m referring to the system that obtains the content for automatic updates,
              patches, content database updates, etc. The common theme here is
              that the app transparently downloads content for you, without you being exposed to the underlying
              details such as the URL or raw file. This includes UI patterns such as <em>Check for updates</em>,
              <em>Click here to download new version</em>, etc.</p>

              </a>
            </p>
            <p>Unfortunately, most of these in-app downloaders are woefully ill-equipped for the task! Many of them lack
              pause/resume functionality, state notifications, retry logic, and progress tracking. Many of them have
              frustrating restrictions, such as time limits for downloading the payload. While most of these issues
              are mere annoyances in the land of fast Internet, at the South Pole, they can make or break
              the app entirely.</p>

            <p>Every app that includes an in-app downloader has to compete with an extraordinarily high bar for usability:
              <strong>web browsers</strong>.</p>
            <p>Think about it! Every modern web browser includes a download manager that contains
              Abort, Pause, and Resume functionality. It allows you to retry failed
              downloads (assuming the content URL doesn’t include an expiring token).
              It clearly shows you current status, download speed, and estimated time remaining. It allows you to choose
              where you save the underlying file, so you can copy it around if needed. And – it doesn’t include arbitrary
              performance cutoffs! If you really want to download a multi-gigabyte file at 60 kbps, go for it!</p>

            <p>It’s no secret that macOS updates are huge. This is sometimes even annoying back home, and it was
              much worse at the South Pole.</p>
            <p>The patch size for minor OS updates is usually between 0.5 and 1.5 gigabytes. Major OS upgrade patches are
              sometimes 6+ gigabytes. Additional tools, such as Xcode, are often multiple gigabytes.</p>

            <p>If every single macOS device at the South Pole downloaded these updates, directly from Apple, we would
              have wasted a tremendous amount of bandwidth. And the built-in macOS downloader certainly wanted
              us to do this! Look at this interface – few controls, no way to break out and easily get
              the underlying patch files. If I canceled the download, or if it failed for some reason, it didn’t always
              intelligently resume. Sometimes, I lost all my progress.</p>

                  and untouched, for 15 days??</em>
              </a>
            </p>
            <p>Now – Apple <em>does</em> have a caching server feature built into macOS. In theory, this should alleviate some
              of the burden! We should be able to leverage this feature to ensure each patch is only downloaded to
              the South Pole one time, and then client Macs will hit the cache.</p>
            <p>I experimented with this feature in my spare time, with a handful of my own Apple devices.
              In practice, this feature still
              required each client Macbook to make a successful HTTPS call directly to Apple, to negotiate cache parameters.
              If this call failed, which it often did (<em>because of hardcoded short timeouts!!!</em>), then
              the client Mac just fetched the patch from public Apple servers. No retry, no notification. The client
              Mac just made a unilateral decision to bypass the cache, without any recourse or even a notification for
              the user. In practice, this initial cache negotiation call failed often enough
              at the South Pole that the caching feature wasn’t useful.</p>
            <p>What we <em>could</em> do was to fetch the full installer (12 gigabytes!) from Apple. Links to the full installer
              packages are conveniently aggregated on the
              <a href="https://mrmacintosh.com/macos-ventura-13-full-installer-database-download-directly-from-apple/">Mr. Macintosh</a>
              blog. We could pull the full installer down to the South Pole slowly
              and conscientiously: throttled, at low,
              background priority, using robust, interrupt-tolerant
              tooling, with support for caching and resumption of paused or failed transfers.
              Once we had the file, we could distribute it on station.
              This process could take several days, but it was reliable.</p>

              </a>
            </p>
            <p>But <em>even this</em> didn’t solve the problem! If the client Mac is Apple Silicon, it <em>still insisted</em> on
              downloading additional content directly from Apple, <em>even if</em> you ran the update using the full, 12 GB
              installer.
              There is no way to bypass or cache this. If the OS update required certain types of
              firmware updates or Rosetta updates, then <em>every Apple Silicon client Mac</em> would <em>still</em>
              download 1-2 GB of data directly from Apple during the install process.</p>
            <p>Even worse, the download process was sometimes farmed out to a separate component in
              macOS, which didn’t even report progress to the installer! Installing a macOS update at
              the South Pole meant staring at a window that said “installing, 32 minutes remaining”,
              for <em>several hours</em>, while a subcomponent of macOS downloaded a gigabyte of un-cacheable
              data in the background.</p>
            <p>Apple naively assumed that the 1 GB download would be so fast that they didn’t bother
              incorporating download speed feedback into the updater’s time estimate.
              They did not anticipate people installing
              macOS updates from a location where a gigabyte of downloads can take <strong>several hours</strong>, if not <strong>days</strong>.</p>
            <p>You can’t cache it, and you can’t download it directly using a web browser (or other mechanism). You have
              to let Apple’s downloader do it directly. And, of course, there’s no pause button. It is a major
              inconvenience to users, and a major waste of bandwidth, for each individual client Mac to
              download 1-2 GB of data in a single, uninterrupted shot.</p>
            <p><strong>Ways that Apple could make this significantly better for users with slow or otherwise-weird Internet:</strong></p>
            <ol>
              <li>Compute the required patch, and then give us a download link, so we can download it outside of
                Apple’s downloader.</li>
              <li>Improve the built-in update download tool with pause/resume functionality and intelligent state
                management, to ensure progress isn’t lost.</li>
              <li>Fix the full installer, so it includes <em>everything</em>, including all the currently-excluded items
                such as firmware and Rosetta updates for Apple Silicon Macs.
                It would be much more useful if it included everything. I
                could download it once, and then distribute it, without worrying about each Mac <em>still</em> needing to fetch
                additional data from Apple.</li>
              <li>Improve the Apple Caching Server feature, so it’s more reliable in situations where direct Internet
                access is unreliable. Give us more controls so that we can force a Mac to use it, and so that we can force
                the caching server to proactively download an item that we know will be needed in the future.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>As it stands, it was a huge hassle for me to help people with macOS updates at the South Pole.</p>
            <h2 id="example-2---samsung-android-phone-os-updates">Example 2 - Samsung Android Phone OS Updates</h2>
            <p>My Samsung Android phone receives periodic OS updates. These updates include relevant Android
              patches, as well as updates to the Samsung UI and other OS components.</p>
            <p>The updater is a particularly bad example of an app that fails to consider slow / intermittent Internet
              use cases.</p>

                <em>Downloading an OS update for my Samsung Android phone at the South Pole.</em>
              </a>
            </p>
            <p>First, the basics. There is no speed indicator, no numeric progress indicator (good luck counting pixels on
              the moving bar), no pause button, no cancel button, no indicator of the file size, and no way to get at
              the underlying file to download separately.</p>
            <p>Second – if the download fails, it cannot be resumed. It will restart from the beginning.</p>
            <p>In practice, at the South Pole, the phone could not download an entire OS update on a single satellite
              pass. So – it inevitably failed as soon as connectivity dropped, and I had to restart it from the
              beginning.</p>
            <p>The <strong>only way</strong> I was able to get this done was by <strong>turning off the phone entirely</strong>, right before
              Internet access dropped, and then turning it back on when Internet access resumed at the next satellite pass.
              This tricked the phone into not giving up on the download, because it was totally off during the period
              without Internet. It never had a chance to fail.
              By doing this, I was able to spread out the download across multiple satellite passes, and I could complete
              the download.</p>
            <p>This is an absurd workaround! I should not have had to do this.</p>
            <p>My US carrier (Verizon) does offer a downloadable application for macOS and Windows which should, in theory,
              allow me to flash the OS updates from my computer, instead of relying on the phone to download the patches.
              In practice, the Verizon app is even worse. Buggy, unreliable, and also insists on using its own in-app
              downloader to fetch the update files (sigh…).</p>
            <p>I’m sure there’s a way I could have gotten the images and flashed them manually.
              This is not an invitation for a bunch
              of Android enthusiasts to email me and explain bootloaders and APKs and ROMs and sideloading and whatever else is
              involved here.
              That’s not the point. The point is – the mainstream tools that vendors ship are <em>hopelessly deficient</em>
              for users on slow Internet, and that’s a bummer.</p>

            <p>A small desktop app has an in-app downloader for updates. Can you spot the issues?</p>

              <li>No cancel button.</li>

              <li>No progress tracking and no graceful resumption of an interrupted download.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>This is actually one of my favorite desktop apps! It’s a shame to call them out like this.
              A quick, easy way to make this MUCH better for users at the South Pole would be to provide a manual download
              link. Then, the developers wouldn’t need to reimplement all the nice download features that my
              browser provides. I could just use my browser.</p>

            <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
            <p>I hope the examples I’ve shown in this post have been a helpful illustration of how minor oversights
              or under-developed features back home can become <strong>major issues</strong> in a place with slow Internet.</p>
            <p>Again, I’m not asking that every app developer spend a huge amount of time optimizing for edge cases like
              the South Pole.</p>
            <p>And I’m also definitely not asking for people to work miracles. Internet access at the South Pole, as of
              October 2023, was <strong><em>slow</em></strong>. I don’t expect immersive interactive streaming media to work
              under the conditions I described here, but it would be nice if apps were resilient enough to
              get a few bytes of text up or down. Unfortunately, what
              often ended up happening is that apps got stuck in a loop because of an ill-advised hardcoded timeout.</p>
            <p>I hope everyone found this helpful, or at least interesting.</p>
            <p>And thank you again to everyone who followed along with me on my Antarctic journey! I’ve been off-ice for about
              six months now, and going through my old posts here have brought back fond memories.</p>
            <p>I hope the current winter-over
              crew is doing well, and that everyone is enjoying the <a href="https://brr.fyi/posts/polar-night">Polar Night</a>. If the egg supply and
              consumption rate is the same as it was during Winter 2023, they should soon be
              finishing up <a href="https://brr.fyi/posts/the-last-egg">The Last Egg</a>.</p>
            <p>I won’t promise any more content, but I do have a handful of other half-finished posts sitting in my

		<p>by Elizabeth Rubio</p>

<p>I was born in 1981, which means I was a young teenager when <em>The X-Files</em> premiered. My mother and I habitually sat down together on Sunday evenings to watch the latest episode.</p>
<p>The show kept me enthralled. Monsters, aliens, secret government agencies—it was all fascinating. But best of all was the central duo: Fox Mulder, the slightly crazy, hot-headed believer, and Dana Scully, the logical, level-headed scientist. Scully was everything I wanted to be: beautiful, brilliant, well respected, and adventurous.</p>
<p>Equally captivating was Clarice Starling in <em>Silence of the Lambs</em>, a movie that came out shortly before <em>The X-Files</em> premiered. Starling and Scully shared many qualities: both FBI agents, both young women, both excellent at their jobs, using logic and clear thinking to get on top of difficult situations.</p>
<p>Motivated by a desire to be like these capable, intelligent women, I signed up for an AP biology course in school. Throughout the year we mated fruit flies to see the inheritance of physical characteristics, we isolated our own DNA, and we demonstrated chromosomal crossover using pop beads. I loved everything about biology, especially the ways that molecular biologists figured out what was going on inside cells using techniques like PCR and gel electrophoresis. I was hooked.</p>
<p>I began to envision myself as, if not a real-life Dana Scully, a real-life Clarice Starling. I imagined my path to the FBI, getting a degree in genetics and working my way up the ranks of the Bureau to Special Agent. I saw myself using reason and logic backed by facts and evidence to work out the solution to any mystery.</p>
<p>I wasn’t alone. The influence of the Dana Scully character on my generation of girls is known as the <a href="https://impact.21cf.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/03/ScullyEffectReport_21CF_1-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scully Effect</a>. We women who frequently watched <em>The X-Files</em> as teenagers were more than 50% more likely to study a STEM field in college than women who didn’t watch. (STEM stands for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.) Nearly two-thirds of women currently working in STEM cited Scully as a major influence on their decision to pursue a STEM career. Two-thirds of women said Scully increased their belief in the importance of STEM, even if they did not pursue careers in a STEM field. Nine in ten women claimed Scully was a positive role model for girls.</p>
<p>I went on to get that genetics degree, although I didn’t join the FBI. (It turns out Special Agents have very little life outside of work, and I decided that wasn’t for me after all.) Instead, I began a career in biotechnology, first in academic research, and later in industrial manufacturing.</p>
<p>I’m no longer working in science, but I still consider myself a scientist because of my scientific approach to understanding the world. I will always be grateful to the creators of <em>The X-Files</em>, and Gillian Anderson especially, for showing me a world that contained smart, capable women like the one I aspired to be, and for letting me know that dream was not just possible, but valuable.</p>
<p>In my work now, I strive to write a diverse cast, including women, people of color, people with disabilities, and queer people. Representation matters. We can’t create a reality until we can imagine it. It’s up to us, the writers, to ensure there’s plenty for future generations to imagine.</p>

</figure><p>The Japanese government is pushing ahead with a plan to make Japan’s publicly funded research output free to read. This month, the science ministry will assign funding to universities to build the infrastructure needed to make research papers free to read on a national scale. The move follows the ministry’s announcement in February that researchers who receive government funding will be required to make their papers freely available to read on the institutional repositories from January 2025.</p><p>The Japanese plan “is expected to enhance the long-term traceability of research information, facilitate secondary research and promote collaboration”, says Kazuki Ide, a health-sciences and public-policy scholar at Osaka University in Suita, Japan, who has <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01340-w" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01340-w" data-track-category="body text link">written about open access in Japan</a>.</p><p>The nation is one of the first Asian countries to make notable advances towards making more research open access (OA) and among first countries in the world to forge a nationwide plan for OA.</p><p>The plan follows in the footsteps of the influential Plan S, introduced six years ago by a group of research funders in the United States and Europe known as <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00883-6" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00883-6" data-track-category="body text link">cOAlition S</a>, to accelerate the move to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03342-6]" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03342-6]" data-track-category="body text link">OA publishing</a>.

Each university will host the research produced by its academics, but the underlying software will be the same.</p><p>In 2022, Japan also launched its <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-01359-x" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-01359-x" data-track-category="body text link">own national preprint server, Jxiv</a>, but its use remains limited with only the few hundred preprint articles posted on the platform to date. Ide says that publishing as preprints is not yet habitual among many researchers in Japan, noting that only around one in five respondents to his 2023 survey<sup><a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">1</a></sup> on Jxiv were even aware that it existed.</p><h2>Green OA</h2><p>Japan’s move to greater access to its research is focusing on 'green OA' — in which authors make the author-accepted, but unfinalized, versions of papers available in the digital repositories, says Seiichi.</p><p>Seiichi says that gold OA — in which the final copyedited and polished version of a paper is made freely available on the journal site — is not feasible on a wide scale. That’s because the cost to make every paper free to read would be too high for universities. Publishers levy an article-processing charge (APC) if the paper is made free to read, rather than being paywalled, a fee that covers a publisher's costs.</p><p>APCs are increasing at an average rate of 4.3% per year, notes Johan Rooryck, a scholar of French linguistics at Leiden University in the Netherlands, and executive director of cOAlition S.</p><p>Rooryck says that Japan’s green OA strategy should be applauded. “It's definitely something that one should do,” he says. “Especially for all the content that is still behind the paywall.”</p><p>Kathleen Shearer, executive director of the Confederation of Open Access Repositories in Montreal, Canada, says that the Japanese plan is “equitable”.</p><p>“It doesn’t matter where you publish, whether you have APCs or not, you are still able to comply with an open-access policy,” she says.</p><p>She adds that the policy will mean that Japan has a unified record of all research produced by its academics because all institutional repositories are hosted on the same national server. “Japan is way ahead of the rest of us,” Shearer says. “More countries are moving in this direction but Japan really was one of the first.”</p><p>Focusing on institutional repositories will have another benefit: it will not discriminate against research published in Japanese, Shearer says. “A big part of their scholarly ecosystem is represented in Japanese.”</p><article data-label="Related">

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-headline="1-bit LLMs Could Solve AI’s Energy Demands"><p>Large language models, the AI systems that power chatbots like <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/chatgpt">ChatGPT</a>, are getting better and better—but they’re also getting bigger and bigger, demanding more energy and computational power. For LLMs that are cheap, fast, and environmentally friendly, they’ll need to shrink, ideally small enough to run directly on devices like cellphones. Researchers are finding ways to do just that by drastically rounding off the many high-precision numbers that store their memories to equal just 1 or -1.</p><p>LLMs, like all neural networks, are trained by altering the strengths of connections between their artificial neurons. These strengths are stored as mathematical parameters. Researchers have long compressed networks by reducing the precision of these parameters—a process called quantization—so that instead of taking up 16 bits each, they might take up 8 or 4. Now researchers are pushing the envelope to a single bit.</p><h2>How to Make a 1-bit LLM</h2><p>There are two general approaches. One approach, called post-training quantization (PTQ) is to quantize the parameters of a full-precision network. The other approach, quantization-aware training (QAT), is to train a network from scratch to have low-precision parameters. So far, PTQ has been more popular with researchers.</p><p>In February, a team including Haotong Qin at ETH Zurich, Xianglong Liu at Beihang University, and Wei Huang at the University of Hong Kong introduced a PTQ method called <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04291" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BiLLM</a>. It approximates most parameters in a network using 1 bit, but represents a few salient weights—those most influential to performance—using 2 bits. In one test, the team binarized a version of Meta’s <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/llama-2-llm" target="_self">LLaMa</a> LLM that has 13 billion parameters.</p><p>“One-bit LLMs open new doors for designing custom hardware and systems specifically optimized for 1-bit LLMs.” <strong>—Furu Wei, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/microsoft">Microsoft</a> Research Asia</strong></p><p>To score performance, the researchers used a metric called<strong></strong>perplexity, which is basically a measure of how surprised the trained model was by each ensuing piece of text. For one dataset, the original model had a perplexity of around 5, and the BiLLM version scored around 15, much better than the closest binarization competitor, which scored around 37 (for perplexity, lower numbers are better). That said, the BiLLM model required about a tenth of the memory capacity as the original.</p><p>PTQ has several advantages over QAT, says Wanxiang Che, a computer scientist at Harbin Institute of Technology, in China. It doesn’t require collecting training data, it doesn’t require training a model from scratch, and the training process is more stable. QAT, on the other hand, has the potential to make models more accurate, since quantization is built into the model from the beginning.</p><h2>1-bit LLMs Find Success Against Their Larger Cousins</h2><p>Last year, a team led by Furu Wei and Shuming Ma, at Microsoft Research Asia, in Beijing, created <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11453" target="_blank">BitNet</a>, the first 1-bit QAT method for LLMs. After fiddling with the rate at which the network adjusts its parameters, in order to stabilize training, they created LLMs that performed better than those created using PTQ methods. They were still not as good as full-precision networks, but roughly 10 times as energy efficient.</p><p>In February, Wei’s team announced <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17764" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BitNet 1.58b</a>, in which parameters can equal -1, 0, or 1, which means they take up roughly 1.58 bits of memory per parameter. A BitNet model with 3 billion parameters performed just as well on various language tasks as a full-precision LLaMA model with the same number of parameters and amount of training—Wei called this an “aha moment”—but it was 2.71 times as fast, used 72 percent less GPU memory, and used 94 percent less GPU energy. Further, the researchers found that as they trained larger models, efficiency advantages improved.</p><p>A BitNet model with 3 billion parameters performed just as well on various language tasks as a full-precision LLaMA model.</p><p>This year, a team led by Che, of Harbin Institute of Technology, released a preprint on another LLM binarization method, called <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11295" target="_blank">OneBit</a>. OneBit combines elements of both PTQ and QAT. It uses a full-precision pretrained LLM to generate data for training a quantized version. The team’s 13-billion-parameter model achieved a perplexity score of around 9 on one dataset, versus 5 for a LLaMA model with 13 billion parameters. Meanwhile, OneBit occupied only 10 percent as much memory. On customized chips, it could presumably run much faster.</p><p>Wei, of Microsoft, says quantized models have multiple advantages. They can fit on smaller chips, they require less data transfer between memory and processors, and they allow for faster processing. Current hardware can’t take full advantage of these models, though. LLMs often run on GPUs like those made by Nvidia, which represent weights using higher precision and spend most of their energy multiplying them. New hardware could natively represent each parameter as a -1 or 1 (or 0), and then simply add and subtract values and avoid multiplication. “One-bit LLMs open new doors for designing custom hardware and systems specifically optimized for 1-bit LLMs,” Wei says.</p><p>“They should grow up together,” Huang, of the University of Hong Kong, says of 1-bit models and processors. “But it’s a long way to develop new hardware.”</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>For years, online lurkers on forums like Redditors have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ActionFigures/comments/14i8z6r/comment/jquppm6/">wondered</a> if a mysterious third-party seller on eBay and Poshmark was simply Target in disguise. It turns out they were sort of correct.</p><p>An eBay account called Bullseye Deals has been live since 2013, boasting 137,000 followers and over 2.6 million items sold. All of its products seem to be from Target. An identical account on Poshmark was launched in 2022 and has already amassed over 20,000 followers. Bullseye Deals’ branding, while not a perfect replica of the big-box retailer’s logo, is a red dot with the silhouette of a bull inside, which looks an awful lot like Target’s bullseye.</p><div id="piano-cta">


<p>These Bullseye Deals e-commerce accounts offer very little explanation beyond the products themselves. The eBay storefront’s description simply says “Resell – Reuse – Recycle.” But, they feature the wide array of products one might buy in a big-box store, from linens to home goods to children’s toys. Some listings are for items from Target’s private label lines, such as A New Day, Boots &amp; Barkley, and Casaluna.<strong> </strong>These products are usually listed as new, open box or pre-owned — and are priced less than what they were originally sold for at Target. For example, a floor lamp listed as new on Bullseye Deals is selling for $21.99 compared to an $80 price tag on Target.com.  </p>



<p>It’s not unheard of for a retailer to offload excess merchandise, what the industry calls salvage. In fact, it’s commonplace. Stores like TJ Maxx and Burlington source their off-price products by working with retailers and brands. Similarly, reverse logistics businesses exist to help consumer-facing brands deal with excess products that can’t be put back on shelves, like returned or discontinued items. Often, these companies will buy excess inventory in bulk from major retailers and then find ways to resell it themselves, be it selling entire pallets of product or inking deals with clearance retailers like bin stores.</p>



<p>Bullseye Deals technically falls into this latter category, though it is branded in a way that at least hints at it being associated with Target. Sources tell Modern Retail that all the listings are salvage merchandise from Target that’s been purchased by the reverse supply chain services company Liquidity Services, Inc.</p>





<p>A Target spokesperson confirmed to Modern Retail that the company that runs the Bullseye Deals account does buy salvage merchandise from Target and sells it. Liquidity Services, Inc. did not respond to a request for comment.</p>



<p>Unsellable inventory is a big problem for retailers. According to a 2023 <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/press-releases/retail-returns-will-surpass-620-billion-in-2023/">estimate</a> from eMarketer, total retail returns hit $613.94 billion, representing 8.5% of total retail sales.  And that doesn’t represent all the products a retailer <a href="https://www.modernretail.co/retailers/retails-inventory-glut-means-big-business-for-liquidators/">might offload</a> because it can’t sell it anymore.</p>



<p> Retailers are often unable to put returned items back on the shelves if, for example, a box gets opened or a product gets lightly used before being returned. Additionally, when factoring in labor and other costs, it might not be worth it for retailers to put some items back on the store floor. For a company like Target — which lets customers return things within 90 days for a full refund — it’s almost certainly swimming in salvage merchandise and is trying to figure out ways to avoid throwing it all out.</p>





<p>Matt Miller, the president and chief operating officer at Mac Wholesale, said there are some examples of retailers including their own branding when selling excess merchandise. Mac Wholesale buys closeout inventory from brands and sells it to other channels like off-price retail. Miller pointed to Best Buy, which has its Outlet program that sells refurbished, clearance and open-box electronics. Similarly, both Macy’s and Nordstrom have off-price outposts like Backstage and Rack.</p>



<p>Miller, however, has never heard of retailers launching e-commerce seller accounts to resell merchandise — nor has he seen reverse logistics businesses build individual online storefronts to mimic the branding of the retailer from which they purchased. </p>



<p>What piqued his interest specifically about this Target example was the fact that Bullseye Deals seems to have all sorts of products, price points and conditions. For example, Miller found a pre-owned Luigi plush toy for around $11. “Most retailers aren’t going through that hassle,” he said. And while it’s true that Target itself isn’t specifically uploading a listing for a stuffed toy, the company it works with is — and is doing it for tens of thousands of products to platforms like eBay.</p>



<p>Target doesn’t control this Bullseye Deals inventory, but it is aware that its reverse logistics partner is doing this. And, according to Miller, it’s a smart way for a retailer to handle merchandise that would otherwise go to the landfill. Especially for a company like Target, which has owned brands that it likely would not like to see show up at other retail stores like TJ Maxx, “it allows them to control the liquidation of their own private-label brands,” Miller said.</p>



<p>Similarly, for other brands that sell at Target, if Target decides to discontinue a product, an e-commerce account like Bullseye Deals is probably more palatable than seeing an item in its clearance section. If a brand is trying to sell to other retailers, “they are going to say ‘what’s wrong if Target is clearance-ing it?'” Miller said.</p>



<p>While Bullseye has been around for years, Miller isn’t surprised that it’s become a popular destination for shoppers nowadays. “Most off-price retailers that would have never considered off-price retail five years ago are considering it now,” he said.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Target — with the help of an intermediary — has been essentially doing this in the shadows. Miller, for one, was shocked he hadn’t seen the Bullseye Deals account until now. “I’m surprised it hasn’t been more visible with that many transactions and that much feedback, he said.</p>

The AOD reduction reaches peak values of around 0.01 in the South China Sea and Eastern North Atlantic off the coasts of Western Europe. In the South Atlantic the regulations create AOD reductions that follow the shape of shipping routes. We then calculate the ratio between the AOD change due to IMO2020 and that between pre-industrial and present day. Over most of the ocean, the ratio is smaller than 10% because of sparse shipping outside the major shipping routes. Over the North Pacific and North Atlantic, on the other hand, it can exceed 10% and reaches 25% in the Norwegian Sea and off the western European and northwestern African coasts. In these regions, the total anthropogenic aerosol concentration is relatively low because of declining emissions of aerosols and their precursors since the 1980s, making ship-emitted aerosols an important component of the anthropogenic maritime aerosols. The IMO2020 is therefore effective in reducing total aerosol loading for these regions. The impact of IMO2020 on the cloud droplet number concentration (N<sub>d</sub>) of low-level maritime clouds as shown in Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-024-01442-3#Fig1">1C</a> (see Methods). Globally, IMO2020 leads to a modest reduction of 0.5 cm<sup>−3</sup> in mean modeled N<sub>d</sub>. Regionally, however, the reduction is more pronounced. The strongest reduction occurs in the North Atlantic, the Caribbeans and the South China Sea, reaching 3 cm<sup>−3</sup>. These are regions with the busiest shipping lanes and thus strongest reduction of ship emissions. The reduction in the South Atlantic shows the most well-defined shipping lane shapes likely due to the unique circulation pattern in this region<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 18" title="Yuan, T. et al.

For simplicity, we ignore the heat uptake by the deep ocean during the short-term, i.e. O(10) years. 0.2 W m<sup>−2</sup> translates to around 0.16 K of warming with a timescale of 7 years. It is equivelant to 0.24 K/decade, which is more than double the average warming rate since 1880 and 20% higher than the mean warming rate since 1980, linear trend of 0.19 K/decade. We also calculated the lower and upper bounds of the forcing and corresponding expected warming (Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-024-01442-3#Fig3">3</a>). The IMO2020 is expected to provide a substantial boost to the warming rate of global mean temperature in the 2020 s. The rate of warming is expected to ramp up quickly from 2020 and asymptotes to the longer-term trend line at the end of 2020<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 27" title="Geoffroy, O. et al.

The 2023 record warmth is within the ranges of our expected trajectory. The magnitude of IMO2020 induced warming means that the observed strong warming in 2023 will be a new norm in the 2020 s. The mean temperature anomaly of the 2020 s will be 0.3 K higher than that of the 2010s. Regionally, the warming effect from IMO2020 on SST is harder to estimate since basin-wide SST changes can be affected by variations in factors like other aerosol concentration, ocean circulation, and air-sea interactions. However, the strong geographical variations in the forcing suggest the impact of IMO2020 on SST may have significant variation among ocean basins. For example, the North Atlantic SST may be disproportionally warmed more by the IMO2020 given the radiative forcing is more than three times the global average, which is likely a contributing factor to the pronounced warming of the North Atlantic SST in recent years<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 28" title="Record-breaking North Atlantic Ocean temperatures contribute to extreme marine heatwaves | Copernicus.

We use a simple functional form for cloud adjustments that only depends on background N<sub>d</sub> to illustrate the point. The total forcing varies between 0.19Wm<sup>−2</sup> and 0.38Wm<sup>−2</sup>, a 100% relative change. The seasonal variation of incoming solar radiation is the dominant driver for this (SOM). But seasonal variations of background CF, N<sub>d</sub>, and ΔN<sub>d</sub> due to IMO2020 also contribute as they affect the magnitude of the Twomey effect and macrophysical (LWP and CF) cloud adjustments. We estimate the contribution from each variable after removing the seasonal change in solar insolation, and report the results in Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-024-01442-3#Fig4">4B–D</a> (see Methods). ΔN<sub>d</sub> induced by IMO2020 is the strongest contributor. Its variations can affect the forcing by more than 30% in some months such as Jan, Apr, and Dec.

The net planetary heat uptake has increased by 0.25 Wm<sup>−2</sup> since 2020, making the 0.2 Wm<sup>−2</sup> due to IMO2020 nearly 80% of the total increase. The long-term trend of CERES TOA net radiation is 0.46 Wm<sup>−2</sup>/decade while it changes to 0.67 Wm<sup>−2</sup>/decade since IMO2020 took effect. The difference is 0.21 Wm<sup>−2</sup> that is consistent with our estimated forcing. However, the record since 2020 is too short to ascertain the impact of IMO2020 on the long-term trend of the energy balance given its large interannual variations. The IMO2020 effect also has an asymmetric impact on aerosol loading in the northern and southern hemispheres because of higher baseline ship emissions in the northern hemisphere. This creates interhemispheric contrast in the resulting radiative forcing, which has important implications for deliberate geoengineering schemes because interhemispheric forcing contrast can create significant perturbations in precipitation patterns<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 6" title="Jones, A., Haywood, J. &amp; Boucher, O.

Since IMO2020 took effect, the northern hemisphere (NH) absorbed solar radiation has increased by 0.5 Wm<sup>−2</sup> from a plateau between 2017 and 2020 while the southern hemisphere (SH) increased at a much slower rate. The low cloud dimming effect of IMO2020 represents around 60% of increase in NH absorbed solar radiation. The interhemispheric contrast in absorbed solar radiation has increased by ~0.2 Wm<sup>−2</sup> based on measurements, one of the highest rates of increase during the whole record, which is almost the same as that induced by low cloud dimming effect of IMO2020. Another rapid increase period is associated with a phase shift in Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) starting 2014/2015 followed by a strong El-Nino event<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 29" title="Loeb, N.

The forcing magnitude of this inadvertent shock has exceeded this limit by a large margin. However, it does suggest that MCB is a viable solar radiation modification scheme in temporarily slowing the rate of climate warming. Our analysis also points to strong spatiotemporal heterogeneities in the forcing produced by the event. Such heterogeneities need to be considered in any MCB scheme to minimize their potential undesired impacts on regional climate in addition to the desired slowing of climate warming rate. Important part of the heterogeneity exists because of background low cloud distribution and its spatiotemporal variability creating an interhemispheric contrast of radiative forcing having similar magnitude as the global mean radiative forcing. Understanding this contrast is important because to achieve the goal of substantially slowing down the warming rate or limit the maximum warming to be within 1.5<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 30" title="IPCC.

As a result, the interhemispheric contrast needs to be minimized to avoid substantial perturbations to regional monsoons and other precipitation patterns. It should be noted that the forcing due to IMO2020 will take time for it to be directly detectable at the global scale in the observation records, but regionally, e.g., in the North Atlantic, its impact may be detectable sooner.

The assumption is that clouds with similar properties respond similarly to addition of aerosols and ship-tracks detected under diverse background cloud conditions can be used to effectively derive these adjustments. Our results are based on the responses from observed ship-track sampled under diverse set of environmental conditions, which allows us to derive robust cloud adjustments based on numerous ship-track samples<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 21" title="Yuan, T. et al.

There are a few assumptions and approximations as noted in our previous study<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 21" title="Yuan, T. et al.

We used SW<sub>downwelling</sub> at the surface from CERES instead of SW<sub>downwelling</sub> at the cloud top, which underestimates the total forcing since SW<sub>downwelling</sub> at the cloud top is larger. The LWP and Cf adjustments can be sensitive to more variables that those considered here. We assume the derived <span>\(\frac{{dCf}}{d{N}_{d}}\)</span> and <span>\(\frac{d{{{{{\mathrm{ln}}}}}}{LWP}}{{dln}{N}_{d}}\)</span> and their dependence on background variables apply to regions that have less ship-track samples. Also, potential semi-direct effects due to absorbing aerosols from ship-emissions are not explicitly addressed in this study since we do not have enough observations.</p><p>The cloud adjustments used here can depend on the background cloud N<sub>d</sub>, SST, EIS, and background N<sub>d</sub> and thus they have spatiotemporal variations due to background changes. The dependence of cloud adjustments can also be parameterized with one or more variables. The N<sub>d</sub>-only functional form provides a lower bound on the forcing calculation<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 21" title="Yuan, T. et al.

The top-of-atmosphere net fluxes provides constraints to the ocean heat storage. It is used here to calculate the interhemispheric contrast in absorbed solar radiation and energy balance. We note that although the interhemispheric contrast is a residue of two large numbers, e.g., the amount of mean absorbed solar radiation in both hemispheres, the observed variation of the contrast is always small. Therefore, even though we cannot directly attribute the variations in the interhemispheric contrast to IMO 2020, it is reasonable to discuss their temporal evolutions and compare the IMO 2020 impact with the observed changes.</p><h3 id="Sec7">Transient warming of IMO2020</h3><p>We consider the simple one-layer energy balance model<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 27" title="Geoffroy, O. et al.

<p><em>Last week we shared a number of <a href="https://connect.mozilla.org/t5/ideas/create-a-web-page-for-a-feature-roadmap/idi-p/5805">updates</a> with our community of users, and now we want to share them here</em>:</p>



<p>At Mozilla, we work hard to make Firefox the best browser for you. That’s why we’re always focused on building a browser that empowers you to choose your own path, that gives you the freedom to explore without worry or compromises. We’re excited to share more about the updates and improvements we have in store for you over the next year.</p>



<h2><strong>Bringing you the features you’ve been asking for</strong></h2>



<p>We’ve been listening to your feedback, and we’re prioritizing the features you want most.</p>



<ul>
<li>Productivity boosters like
<ul>
<li><strong>Tab Grouping, Vertical Tabs, </strong>and our handy <strong>Sidebar</strong> will help you stay organized no matter how many tabs you have open — whether it’s 7 or <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/firefox-power-user-keeps-7400-plus-browser-tabs-open-for-2-years">7,500.</a>&nbsp;</li>



<li>Plus, our new <strong>Profile Management system</strong> will help keep your school, work, and personal browsing separate but easily accessible.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Customizable new tab wallpapers</strong> that will let you choose from a diverse range of photography, colors, and abstract images that suits you most.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Intuitive privacy settings</strong> that deliver all the power of our world-class anti-tracking technologies in a simplified, easy-to-understand way.</li>



<li><strong>More</strong><strong> </strong><strong>streamlined menus</strong> that reduce visual clutter and prioritize top user actions so you can get to the important things quicker.</li>
</ul>



<h2><strong>Continuous work on speed, performance and compatibility</strong></h2>



<p>Speed is everything when you’re online, so we’re continuing to work hard to make Firefox as fast and efficient as possible. You can expect even <strong>faster, smoother browsing on Firefox</strong>,<strong> </strong>thanks to<strong> quicker page loads and startup times</strong> – all while <strong>saving more of your phone’s battery life</strong>. We’ve already improved responsiveness by 20 percent as measured by <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2024/03/improving-performance-in-firefox-and-across-the-web-with-speedometer-3/">Speedometer 3</a>, a collaboration we’ve spearheaded with other leading tech companies. And in that collaborative spirit, we’re also working with the <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2024/02/announcing-interop-2024/">Interop project</a> to make it easy for people to build sites that work great across all browsers. We value your support in our efforts to improve cross-browser compatibility which is why we’ve added new features to easily report when websites aren’t working quite right; this feedback is critical as we look to address even small functionality issues that affect your day-to-day online experience.</p>



<h2><strong>Making the most of your time online — without sacrifice</strong></h2>



<p>Ensuring your privacy is core to everything we do at Firefox. Unlike other companies, who ask you to exchange your data in order to do even basic, everyday things online — you don’t have to give up your personal information to get a faster, more efficient browser experience with Firefox. Reading a news story in a different language or signing a form for school or work shouldn’t require you to give up your privacy. So, we’ve worked hard to make things like translation and PDF editing in Firefox happen locally on your device, so you don’t have to ship off your personal data to a server farm for a company to use it how they see fit — to keep tabs on you, sell your information to the highest bidder, or train their AI. With Firefox, you have a lot of choice — but you don’t have to choose between utility and privacy. Your data is secure, and most importantly, just yours.</p>



<p>We are approaching the use of AI in Firefox — which many, many of you have been asking about — in the same way. We’re focused on giving you AI features that solve tangible problems, respect your privacy, and give you real choice.</p>



<p>We’re looking at how we can use local, on-device AI models — i.e., more private — to enhance your browsing experience further. One feature we’re starting with next quarter is <strong>AI-generated alt-text for images inserted into PDFs</strong>, which makes it more accessible to visually impaired users and people with learning disabilities.</p>
