<p dir="auto"><strong>go-mysql-server</strong> is a data-source agnostic SQL engine and server
which runs queries on data sources you provide, using the MySQL
dialect and wire protocol. A simple in-memory database implementation
is included, and you can query any data source you want by
implementing your own backend.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://www.doltdb.com/" rel="nofollow">Dolt</a>, a SQL database with Git-style
versioning, is the main production database implementation of this
package.  <a href="https://docs.dolthub.com/introduction/what-is-dolt" rel="nofollow">Check
out</a> that project
for reference a implementation. Or, hop into the Dolt discord
<a href="https://discord.com/invite/RFwfYpu" rel="nofollow">here</a> if you want to talk to the
<a href="https://www.dolthub.com/team" rel="nofollow">core developers</a> behind
<strong>go-mysql-server</strong> and Dolt.</p>

<p dir="auto">With the exception of specific limitations (see below),
<strong>go-mysql-server</strong> is a drop-in replacement for MySQL. Any client
library, tool, query, SQL syntax, SQL function, etc. that works with
MySQL should also work with <strong>go-mysql-server</strong>. If you find a gap in
functionality, please file an issue.</p>
<p dir="auto">For full MySQL compatibility documentation, see the <a href="https://docs.dolthub.com/sql-reference/sql-support" rel="nofollow">Dolt

<ul dir="auto">
<li>SQL server and engine to query your data sources.</li>
<li>In-memory database backend implementation suitable for use in tests.</li>
<li>Interfaces you can use to implement new backends to query your own
data sources.</li>
<li>With a few caveats and using a full database implementation, a

<p dir="auto"><strong>go-mysql-server</strong> has two primary uses case:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">Stand-in for MySQL in a golang test environment, using the built-in
<code>memory</code> database implementation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Providing access to arbitrary data sources with SQL queries by
implementing a handful of interfaces. The most complete real-world

                                    <h2><strong>Cow Magnets</strong></h2>
<p><span lang="en">What is a <strong>cow magnet</strong>？Have you ever heard of this <strong><a href="https://www.stanfordmagnets.com/what-are-the-four-types-of-magnets.html">type of magnet</a></strong>? Actually, <strong>c</strong></span><strong>ow magnets</strong> are very popular with farmers, ranchers, and veterinarians since they are a well-known method of&nbsp;preventing hardware disease in cattle. So what’s&nbsp;hardware disease?</p>

<h2><strong>About Hardware Disease</strong></h2>
<p>Hardware disease is a common term for bovine traumatic reticulopericarditis. It is usually caused by the ingestion of a sharp, metallic object. These pieces of metal settle in the reticulum and can irritate or penetrate the lining. It is most common in dairy cattle but is occasionally seen in beef cattle. It is very rarely reported in any other ruminants. It can be difficult to conclusively diagnose but can be prevented by the oral administration of a magnet around the time that the animal reaches the age of one year.</p>
<h2><strong>Causes of </strong><strong>Hardware Disease</strong></h2>
<p>Cattle commonly swallow foreign objects, because they do not use their lips to discriminate between materials and they do not completely chew their feed before swallowing.&nbsp;<span lang="en">Sharp metal objects (such as nails or iron wires) are a common cause of hardware diseases.&nbsp;The object travels into the rumen and is then pushed into the reticulum along with the rest of the feed.&nbsp; In some cases, contractions of the reticulum can push the object through part of the reticulum wall into the peritoneal cavity, where it causes severe inflammation.&nbsp;In rare cases, the metal object penetrates the entire wall of the reticulum and can pierce the heart sac, causing pericarditis. Compression by the uterus in late pregnancy, straining during parturition, and mounting during estrus can increase the likelihood of the object penetrating the abdominal wall or the heart sac.</span></p>
<h2><strong>How to prevent the hardware disease?</strong></h2>
<p><span lang="en">A <strong>cow magnet</strong> is a kind of veterinary medical equipment used to treat or prevent hardware diseases of cattle.&nbsp;Traditionally, the cow magnets are strong <strong><a href="https://www.stanfordmagnets.com/alnico-magnets.html">Alnico magnets</a></strong>, in the shape of a smooth rod, about 1 cm by 8 cm (0.4 by 3.1 inches). However, today they are more commonly several ring-shaped <strong><a href="https://www.stanfordmagnets.com/ceramic-ferrite-magnets.html">ferrite magnets</a></strong> attached to a stainless-steel or plastic core, in the same shape as the single-piece original.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span lang="en">Newer designs to help increase effectiveness include a cage design, in which the magnet holds metal objects inside a protective plastic framework. Even newer designs include a stronger array of <strong><a href="https://www.stanfordmagnets.com/are-rare-earth-magnets-really-rare.html">rare-earth magnets</a></strong> inside a stainless steel body that resembles the original Alnico design.</span></p>
<p>A rancher or dairy farmer feeds a magnet to each calf at branding time; the magnet settles in the rumen or reticulum and remains there for the life of the animal.&nbsp;The magnet is administered after fasting the cow for 18–24 hours. This is most effective if done to the entire herd before the age of one.</p>
<p>The cow magnet attracts such objects and prevents them from becoming lodged in the animal’s tissue. While the resultant mass of iron remains in the cow’s rumen as a pseudobezoar (an intentionally introduced bezoar), it does not cause the severe problems of hardware disease. Cow magnets cannot be passed through a cow’s 4th bonivial meta-colon.</p>
<p>Cow magnets are widely available from veterinary, feed supply, and scientific supply sources.</p>

                            <p>This course is a deep dive into the world of <strong>PlayStation</strong> programming! We'll explore the PS1 hardware, understand its sub-components, and learn how to code games using <strong>MIPS assembler</strong> &amp; the <strong>C programming language</strong>. We'll also learn how to use the official Sony <strong>Psy-Q</strong> libraries on a modern development toolchain to be more productive and push faster 3D polygons out of our console.</p>

                            <p>We are about to enter the 5th generation of 32-bit consoles. This era brings with it many technology milestones, such as the adoption of CPUs based on <strong>RISC architecture</strong> and a preference for coding using a <strong>high-level language</strong> instead of writing games using plain assembly. We will start by learning the basics of MIPS assembly and evolve to use a C compiler with the official Psy-Q library to develop our final project.</p>

                            <p>Learning how to create games for the original PlayStation is a great excuse to explore really hardcore <strong>computer science</strong> topics. As we learn different aspects of the 32-bit generation of consoles, we'll touch important concepts like algorithms, data structures, data compression, machine architecture, fixed-point math, computer graphics, and much (much!) more.</p>

                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <p>Many new games try to imitate the style and the visuals of old PS1 era using a modern game engine. This is <strong>no imitation</strong>! We'll be flipping bits on the <strong>OG</strong> PlayStation.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <p>Many people are surprised that the first part of the course uses <strong>MIPS assembly</strong>. Using an assembler in the early stages of our course allows us to really understand the low-level aspects of the console &amp; really grok how data flow inside the machine.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div>
                            <p>We'll then move away from assembly and climb one layer of abstraction up. We'll work with a <strong>C compiler</strong> paired with the official Sony Psy-Q library. This is where we'll really glue all the concepts that we learned before to consolidate our knowledge with a final big project.</p>

                            <p>At the end of the course, you'll have all the tools and the skills you need to grow and evolve on your own. You'll have a working project running on the PlayStation console and a deep understanding of the theory that underpins the development of PS1 games.</p>

In Zed Decoded I'm going to take a close look at Zed — how it's built, which data structures it uses, which technologies and techniques, what features it has, which bugs we ran into. The best part? I won't do this alone, but get to interview and ask my colleagues here at Zed about everything I want to know.</p>
<div><div><p><b>Companion Video</b>: <!-- -->Async Rust</p><p>This post comes with a 1hr companion video, in which Thorsten and Antonio explore how Zed uses async Rust —&nbsp;in Zed. It's a loose conversation that focuses on the code and dives a bit deeper into some topics that didn't fit into the post.</p><p>Watch the video here:<!-- --> <a href="https://youtu.be/gkU4NGSe21I">https://youtu.be/gkU4NGSe21I</a></p></div><p><img src="https://zed.dev/img/post/zed-decoded-async-rust/thumbnail.jpg" width="230" height="150"></p></div>
<p>The first topic that was on my list: async Rust and how it's used in Zed. Over the past few months I've become quite fascinated with async Rust — Zed's the first codebase I've worked in that uses it — so I decided to sit down and ask Antonio, one of Zed's co-founders, about how we use async Rust in Zed.</p>
<p>We won't get into the details of async Rust itself (familiarity with that is to be expected if you want to understand the nitty-gritty of the code we'll see), but instead focus on how Zed uses async Rust to build a high-performance, native application: what async code looks like on the application level, which runtime it uses, why it uses that runtime.</p>
<h2 id="writing-async-rust-with-gpui"><span data-br=":R4nbrrrqbf9la:" data-brr="1">Writing async Rust with GPUI</span></h2>
<p>Let's jump right into the deep end. Here is a snippet of code that's representative of async code in the Zed codebase:</p>
<figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><div><pre tabindex="0" data-language="rust" data-theme="light-plus"><code data-language="rust" data-theme="light-plus"><span data-line=""><span>fn</span><span> show_cursor_names</span><span>(&amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> self</span><span>, </span><span>cx</span><span>: &amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> ViewContext</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Self</span><span>&gt;) {</span></span>

<span data-line=""><span>        cx</span><span>.</span><span>background_executor</span><span>().</span><span>timer</span><span>(CURSORS_VISIBLE_FOR).</span><span>await</span><span>;</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>        this</span><span>.</span><span>update</span><span>(&amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> cx</span><span>, |</span><span>this</span><span>, </span><span>cx</span><span>| {</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>            this</span><span>.show_cursor_names = </span><span>false</span><span>;</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>            cx</span><span>.</span><span>notify</span><span>()</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>        })</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>        .</span><span>ok</span><span>()</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    })</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    .</span><span>detach</span><span>();</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div></figure>
<p>It's <a href="https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/blob/98ddefc8884d0957ab766b3aea09265c8423684e/crates/editor/src/editor.rs#L3935-L3947">a function from our <code>Editor</code></a>. When it's called, Zed shows the names of the owners of each cursor: your name or the names of the people you're collaborating with. It's called, for example, when the editor is re-focused, so you can quickly see who's doing what and where.</p>
<p>What <code>show_cursor_names</code> does is the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Toggle on <code>Editor.show_cursor_names</code> and trigger a re-render of the editor. When <code>Editor.show_cursor_names</code> is true, cursor names will be rendered.</li>
<li>Spawn a task that sleeps for <code>CURSOR_VISIBLE_FOR</code>, turn the cursors off, and trigger another re-render.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you've ever written async Rust before, you can spot some familiar elements in the code: there's a <code>.spawn</code>, there's an <code>async move</code>, there's an <code>await</code>. And if you've ever used the <code>async_task</code> crate before, this might remind you of code <a href="https://docs.rs/async-task/4.7.0/async_task/struct.Task.html#method.detach">like this</a>:</p>
<figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><div><pre tabindex="0" data-language="rust" data-theme="light-plus"><code data-language="rust" data-theme="light-plus"><span data-line=""><span>let</span><span> ex</span><span> = </span><span>Executor</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>();</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>ex</span><span>.</span><span>spawn</span><span>(</span><span>async</span><span> {</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    loop</span><span> {</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>        Timer</span><span>::</span><span>after</span><span>(</span><span>Duration</span><span>::</span><span>from_secs</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)).</span><span>await</span><span>;</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    }</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>})</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>.</span><span>detach</span><span>();</span></span></code></pre></div></figure>
<p>That's because Zed uses <code>async_task</code> for its <code>Task</code> type. But in this example there's an <code>Executor</code> — where is that in the Zed code? And what does <code>cx.background_executor()</code> do? Good questions, let's find answers.</p>
<h2 id="macos-as-our-async-runtime"><span data-br=":Rdnbrrrqbf9la:" data-brr="1">macOS as our async runtime</span></h2>
<p>One remarkable thing about async Rust is that it allows you to choose your own runtime. That's different from a lot of other languages (such as JavaScript) in which you can also write asynchronous code. Runtime isn't a term with very sharp definition, but for our purposes here, we can say that a runtime is the thing that runs your asynchronous code and provides you with utilities such as <code>.spawn</code> and something like an <code>Executor</code>.</p>
<p>The most popular of these runtimes is probably <a href="https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio">tokio</a>. But there's also <a href="https://github.com/smol-rs/smol">smol</a>, <a href="https://github.com/embassy-rs/embassy">embassy</a> and others. Choosing and switching runtimes comes with tradeoffs, they <a href="https://corrode.dev/blog/async/">are only interchangable to a degree</a>, but it is possible.</p>
<p>In Zed for macOS, as it turns out, we don't use any one of these. We also don't use <code>async_task</code>'s <code>Executor</code>. But there has to be something to execute the asynchronous code, right? Otherwise I wouldn't be typing these lines in Zed.</p>
<p>So what then does <code>cx.spawn</code> do and what is the <code>cx.background_executor()</code>? Let's take a look. Here are <a href="https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/blob/dc98b3cfa19d6bd4eae813ce7dfaf9d9e13c232c/crates/gpui/src/app.rs#L818-L836">three relevant methods from GPUI's <code>AppContext</code></a>:</p>

<p>Alright, two executors, <code>foreground_executor</code> and <code>background_executor</code>, and both have <code>.spawn</code> methods. We already saw <code>background_executor</code>'s <code>.spawn</code> above in <code>show_cursor_names</code> and here, in <code>AppContext.spawn</code>, we see the <code>foreground_executor</code> counterpart.</p>
<p>One level deeper, we can see what <code>foreground_executor.spawn</code> does:</p>

<p>There's a lot going on here, a lot of syntax, but what happens can be boiled down to this: the <code>.spawn</code> method takes in a <code>future</code>, turns it into a <a href="https://docs.rs/async-task/latest/async_task/struct.Runnable.html"><code>Runnable</code></a> and a <code>Task</code>, and asks the <code>dispatcher</code> to run it on the main thread.</p>
<p>The <code>dispatcher</code> here is a <code>PlatformDispatcher</code>. That's the GPUI equivalent of <code>async_task</code>'s <code>Executor</code> from above. It has <code>Platform</code> in its name because it has different implementations for macOS, Linux, and Windows. But in this post, we're only going to look at macOS, since that's our best-supported platform at the moment and Linux/Windows implementations are still work-in-progress.</p>
<p>So what does <code>dispatch_on_main_thread</code> do? Does <em>this</em> now call an async runtime? No, no runtime <a href="https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/blob/dc98b3cfa19d6bd4eae813ce7dfaf9d9e13c232c/crates/gpui/src/platform/mac/dispatcher.rs#L66-L75">there either</a>:</p>

<p><code>dispatch_async_f</code> is where the call leaves the Zed codebase, because <code>dispatch_async_f</code> is actually a compile-time generated binding to the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/dispatch/1452834-dispatch_async_f"><code>dispatch_async_f</code></a> function in <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/DISPATCH">macOS' Grand Central Dispatch's (GCD)</a>. <code>dispatch_get_main_queue()</code>, too, is such a binding.</p>
<p>That's right: Zed, as a macOS application, uses macOS' GCD to schedule and execute work.</p>
<p>What happens in the snippet above is that Zed turns the <code>Runnable</code> — think of it as a handle to a <code>Task</code> — into a raw pointer and passes it to <code>dispatch_async_f</code> along with a <code>trampoline</code>, which puts it on its <code>main_queue</code>.</p>
<p>When GCD then decides it's time to run the next item on the <code>main_queue</code>, it pops it off the queue, and calls <code>trampoline</code>, which takes the raw pointer, turns it back into a <code>Runnable</code> and, to poll the <code>Future</code> behind its <code>Task</code>, calls <code>.run()</code> on it.</p>
<p>And, as I learned to my big surprise: that's it. That's essentially all the code necessary to use GCD as a "runtime" for async Rust. Where other applications use tokio or smol, Zed uses thin wrappers around GCD and crates such as <code>async_task</code>.</p>
<p>Wait, but what about the <code>BackgroundExecutor</code>? It's very, very similar to the <code>ForegroundExecutor</code>, with the main difference being that the <code>BackgroundExecutor</code> calls this method on <code>PlatformDispatcher</code>:</p>

<span data-line=""><span>    }</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div></figure>
<p>The only difference between this <code>dispatch</code> method and <code>dispatch_async_f</code> from above is the queue. The <code>BackgroundExecutor</code> doesn't use the <code>main_queue</code>, but <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/dispatch/1452927-dispatch_get_global_queue?language=objc">a global queue</a>.</p>
<p>Like I did when I first read through this code, you now might wonder: why?</p>
<p>Why use GCD? Why have a <code>ForegroundExecutor</code> and a <code>BackgroundExecutor</code>? What's so special about the <code>main_queue</code>?</p>
<h2 id="never-block-the-main-thread"><span data-br=":R14nbrrrqbf9la:" data-brr="1">Never block the main thread</span></h2>
<p>In a native UI application, the main thread is important. No, the main thread is <em>holy</em>. The main thread is where the rendering happens, where user input is handled, where the operating system communicates with the application. The main thread should never, ever block. On the main thread, the responsiveness of your app lives or dies.</p>
<p>That's true for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocoa_(API)">Cocoa</a> applications on macOS too. Rendering, receiving user input, communication with macOS, and other platform concerns have to happen on the main thread. And since Zed wants perfect cooperation with macOS to ensure high-performance and responsiveness, it does two things.</p>
<p>First, it uses GCD to schedule its work — on and off the main thread — so that macOS can maintain high responsiveness and overall system efficiency.</p>
<p>Second, the importance of the main thread is baked into GPUI, the UI framework, by explicitly making the distinction between the <code>ForegroundExecutor</code> and the <code>BackgroundExecutor</code>, both of which we saw above.</p>
<p>As a writer of application-level Zed code, you should always be mindful of what happens on the main thread and never put too much blocking work on it. If you were to put, say, a blocking <code>sleep(10ms)</code> on the main thread, rendering the UI now has to wait for that <code>sleep()</code> to finish, which means that rendering the next frame would take longer than 8ms — the maximum frame time available if you want to achieve <a href="https://zed.dev/blog/120fps">120 FPS</a>. You'd "drop a frame", as they say.</p>
<p>Knowing that, let's take a look at another small snippet of code. This time it's from the built-in terminal in Zed, a function that <a href="https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/blob/dc98b3cfa19d6bd4eae813ce7dfaf9d9e13c232c/crates/terminal/src/terminal.rs#L1346-L1358">searches through the contents of the terminal buffer</a>:</p>

<p>The first line in <code>find_matches</code>, the <code>self.term.clone()</code>, happens on the main thread and is quick: <code>self.term</code> is an <code>Arc&lt;Mutex&lt;...&gt;&gt;</code>, so cloning only bumps the reference count on the <code>Arc</code>. The call to <code>.lock()</code> then only happens in the background, since <code>.lock()</code> might block. It's unlikely that there will be contention for this lock in this particular code path, but if there was contention, it wouldn't freeze the UI, only a single background thread. That's the pattern: if it's quick, you can do it on the main thread, but if it might take a while or even block, put it on a background thread by using <code>cx.background_executor()</code>.</p>
<p>Here's another example, the project-wide search in Zed (<code>⌘-shift-f</code>). It pushes as much heavy work as possible onto background threads to ensure Zed stays responsive while searching through tens of thousands of files in your project. Here's a simplified and heavily-commented <a href="https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/blob/dc98b3cfa19d6bd4eae813ce7dfaf9d9e13c232c/crates/project/src/project.rs#L6485-L6498">excerpt from <code>Project.search_local</code></a> that shows the main part of the search:</p>

<p>It's a lot of code — sorry! — but there's not a lot more going on than the concepts we already talked about. What's noteworthy here and why I wanted to show it is the ping-pong between the main thread and background threads:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>main thread</strong>: kicks off the search and hands the <code>query</code> over to background thread</li>
<li><strong>background thread</strong>: finds files in project with &gt;1 occurrences of <code>query</code> in them, sends results back over channel as they come in</li>
<li><strong>main thread</strong>: waits until background thread has found <code>MAX+1</code> results, then drops channel, which causes background thread to exit</li>
<li><strong>main thread</strong>: spawns multiple other main-thread tasks to open each file &amp; create a snapshot.</li>
<li><strong>background threads</strong>: search through buffer snapshot to find all results in a buffer, sends results back over channel</li>
<li><strong>main thread</strong>: waits for background thread to find results in all buffers, then sends them back to the caller of the outer <code>search_local</code> method</li>
</ul>
<p>Even though this method can be optimized and the search made a lot faster (we haven't gotten around to that yet), it can already search thousands of files without blocking the main thread, while still using multiple CPU cores.</p>

<p>I'm pretty sure that the previous code excerpt raised a lot of questions that I haven't answered yet: how exactly is it possible to send a buffer snapshot to a background thread? How efficient is it do that? What if I want to modify such a snapshot on another thread? How do you test all this?</p>
<p>And I'm sorry to say that I couldn't fit all of the answers into this post. But there is a <a href="https://youtu.be/gkU4NGSe21I">companion video</a> in which Antonio and I did dive into a lot of these areas and talked about async-friendly data structures, copy-on-write buffer snapshots, and other things. Antonio also gave <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms8zKpS_dZE">a fantastic talk about how we do property-testing of async Rust code</a> in the Zed code base that I highly recommend. I also promise that in the future there will be a post about the data structures underlying the Zed editor.</p>

<p>We introduce ScreenAI, a vision-language model for user interfaces and infographics that achieves state-of-the-art results on UI and infographics-based tasks. We are also releasing three new datasets: Screen Annotation to evaluate the layout understanding capability of the model, as well as ScreenQA Short and Complex ScreenQA for a more comprehensive evaluation of its QA capability.</p>

<div>
        <p data-block-key="df7wk">Screen user interfaces (UIs) and infographics, such as charts, diagrams and tables, play important roles in human communication and human-machine interaction as they facilitate rich and interactive user experiences. UIs and infographics share similar design principles and visual language (e.g., icons and layouts), that offer an opportunity to build a single model that can understand, reason, and interact with these interfaces. However, because of their complexity and varied presentation formats, infographics and UIs present a unique modeling challenge.</p><p data-block-key="9f7at">To that end, we introduce “<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04615" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ScreenAI: A Vision-Language Model for UI and Infographics Understanding</a>”. ScreenAI improves upon the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18565" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PaLI architecture</a> with the flexible patching strategy from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03347" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pix2struct</a>. We train ScreenAI on a unique mixture of datasets and tasks, including a novel Screen Annotation task that requires the model to identify UI element information (i.e., type, location and description) on a screen. These text annotations provide large language models (LLMs) with screen descriptions, enabling them to automatically generate question-answering (QA), UI navigation, and summarization training datasets at scale. At only 5B parameters, ScreenAI achieves state-of-the-art results on UI- and infographic-based tasks (<a href="https://x-lance.github.io/WebSRC/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WebSRC</a> and <a href="https://github.com/aburns4/MoTIF" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MoTIF</a>), and best-in-class performance on <a href="https://github.com/vis-nlp/ChartQA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chart QA</a>, <a href="https://rrc.cvc.uab.es/?ch=17&amp;com=evaluation&amp;task=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DocVQA</a>, and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.12756" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">InfographicVQA</a> compared to models of similar size.

        <p data-block-key="df7wk">ScreenAI’s architecture is based on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06794" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PaLI</a>, composed of a multimodal encoder block and an autoregressive decoder. The PaLI encoder uses a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vision transformer</a> (ViT) that creates image embeddings and a multimodal encoder that takes the concatenation of the image and text embeddings as input. This flexible architecture allows ScreenAI to solve vision tasks that can be recast as text+image-to-text problems.</p><p data-block-key="fnskt">On top of the PaLI architecture, we employ a flexible patching strategy introduced in pix2struct. Instead of using a fixed-grid pattern, the grid dimensions are selected such that they preserve the native aspect ratio of the input image. This enables ScreenAI to work well across images of various aspect ratios.</p><p data-block-key="bnr6j">The ScreenAI model is trained in two stages: a pre-training stage followed by a fine-tuning stage. First, self-supervised learning is applied to automatically generate data labels, which are then used to train ViT and the language model. ViT is frozen during the fine-tuning stage, where most data used is manually labeled by human raters.</p>

    <p data-block-key="xjbkq">To create a pre-training dataset for ScreenAI, we first compile an extensive collection of screenshots from various devices, including desktops, mobile, and tablets. This is achieved by using <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10683" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">publicly accessible web pages</a> and following the programmatic exploration approach used for the <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3126594.3126651" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RICO dataset</a> for mobile apps. We then apply a layout annotator, based on the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.12872" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DETR</a> model, that identifies and labels a wide range of UI elements (e.g., image, pictogram, button, text) and their spatial relationships. Pictograms undergo further analysis using an <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02663" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">icon classifier</a> capable of distinguishing 77 different icon types. This detailed classification is essential for interpreting the subtle information conveyed through icons. For icons that are not covered by the classifier, and for infographics and images, we use the PaLI image captioning model to generate descriptive captions that provide contextual information. We also apply an <a href="https://cloud.google.com/use-cases/ocr" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">optical character recognition</a> (OCR) engine to extract and annotate textual content on screen. We combine the OCR text with the previous annotations to create a detailed description of each screen.</p>

<section>
    
    <p data-block-key="xjbkq">We introduce the ScreenAI model along with a unified representation that enables us to develop self-supervised learning tasks leveraging data from all these domains. We also illustrate the impact of data generation using LLMs and investigate improving model performance on specific aspects with modifying the training mixture. We apply all of these techniques to build multi-task trained models that perform competitively with state-of-the-art approaches on a number of public benchmarks. However, we also note that our approach still lags behind large models and further research is needed to bridge this gap.</p>

                            <p>Our mission at Fairphone is to establish a viable market for sustainable consumer electronics. Many of the problems that we see with smartphones, especially around e-waste and issues in the supply chain, also apply to audio products. In 2021, the Fairphone TWS earbuds were our first step into this new product category. They incorporated longer battery life and Fairtrade gold in the supply chain, but were, otherwise, an off-the-shelf design that was not repairable. Our plan was therefore always to improve on the design later on. The Fairbuds are the result of these efforts.

                            <p>There is a standard 2-year warranty on the earbuds, plus a one-year extended warranty if users register their Fairbuds online. That said, due to the modular design and the repairability, we expect the Fairbuds to last a lot longer than three years.

                            <p>The Fairbuds app offers users more control over their earbuds, allowing you to change equalizer presets and tune your Fairbuds to your personal preferences. You can use the app to access the latest Fairbuds updates as well, ensuring better longevity of your device, with potentially new features, and the occasional bug-fix.

I am very saddened, and I will miss him sorely.”</p><p>The evening before the discovery of the particle was announced, Peter was invited to a small celebration at the home of John Ellis, the former head of theory at Cern. “A giant of particle physics has left us,” Ellis told the Guardian. “Without his theory, atoms could not exist and radioactivity would be a force as strong as electricity and magnetism.</p><p>“His prediction of the existence of the particle that bears his name was a deep insight, and its discovery at Cern in 2012 was a crowning moment that confirmed his understanding of the way the Universe works.”</p><p>Jon Butterworth, a member of the Atlas collaboration, said Higgs was “a hero to the particle physics community”.</p><p>“Even though he didn’t much enjoy it, he felt a responsibility to use the public profile his achievements brought him for the good of science, and he did so many times. The particle that carries his name is perhaps the single most stunning example of how seemingly abstract mathematical ideas can make predictions which turn out to have huge physical consequences.”</p><p>The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which awards the Nobel, said at the time the standard model of physics which underpins the scientific understanding of the universe “rests on the existence of a special kind of particle: the Higgs particle. This particle originates from an invisible field that fills up all space.</p><p>“Even when the universe seems empty this field is there. Without it, we would not exist, because it is from contact with the field that particles acquire mass. The theory proposed by Englert and Higgs describes this process.”</p><p>An immensely shy man who disliked the fuss, Higgs had left home for a quiet lunch of soup and trout in Leith on the day of the announcement, to be stopped by a former neighbour who gave him the news on his way home.</p><p>Born in Newcastle upon Tyne, Higgs leaves two sons, Chris and Jonny, his daughter-in-law Suzanne and two grandchildren. His wife, Jody, a linguistics lecturer from whom he was separated, died in 2008.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>I’m excited to announce that Beeper has been acquired by Automattic. This acquisition marks the beginning of an exciting new chapter as we continue our mission to create the best chat app on earth.</p>







<blockquote>
<p>If you haven’t heard of <a href="https://beeper.com/">Beeper</a> before, welcome! We make a universal chat app – one app to send and receive messages on 14 different chat networks. You might have also heard about Beeper Mini, our briefly available iMessage-on-Android app.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In many ways, our journey has only just begun. Beeper has just over 115,000 users and was, <a href="https://blog.beeper.com/2024/04/09/beeper-is-now-available/">until today</a>, in beta. Given the state of the messaging landscape today, we believe there is a huge opportunity for us to push boundaries and create new experiences in chat. The majority of other chat apps have stagnated, entrenched in their positions, with <a href="https://twitter.com/ericmigi/status/1761916874227622299">no significant new players</a> emerging since Discord’s launch in 2015. Given the state of the messaging world, we’ve long felt the need for a strong ally with the resources to support us on our quest. Automattic has a long history of putting user control and privacy first with open source, and great bilateral relationships with Meta, Apple, Microsoft, Google, Matrix and others that we hope can usher in a new era of collaboration.</p>



<p>It’s a fantastic match. Automattic is best known for supporting WordPress and WooCommerce – two open source software projects that underpin huge portions of the internet’s publishing and ecommerce infrastructure. Together, we’ll develop software for a third fundamental pillar of the internet: chat.</p>



<p>Matt, Automattic’s CEO, and I have known each other for years. He was an early user, supporter and investor in Beeper. We’re very well aligned on our goal (build the best chat app on earth), approach (open source where possible), and independence (Beeper will operate independently as part of Automattic’s Other Bets division).</p>



<p>This is a big bet. Automattic is doubling down on chat after their acquisition last year of <a href="http://texts.com/">Texts.com</a>, a messaging app with a similar mission. Our teams and products will merge, and I will take on the role leading the team as Head of Messaging. It will take a bit of time for us to integrate and combine forces under the Beeper brand. We’ve got big plans! I’m really excited about the future of chat 📟</p>



<p><strong>Eric Migicovsky</strong></p>



<p>Beeper CEO → Automattic Head of Messaging<br></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We are thrilled to announce the preview of Explore Logs, a new way to browse your logs without writing LogQL. In this post, we’ll cover why we built Explore Logs and we’ll dive deeper into some of its features, including at-a-glance breakdowns by label, detected fields, and our new pattern detection. At the end, we’ll tell you how you can try Explore Logs for yourself today.</p><p>But let’s start from the beginning — with good old LogQL.</p><h2 id="we-love-logql">We love LogQL</h2><p>Grafana Loki, Grafana Labs’ <a href="https://github.com/grafana/loki" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open source log aggregation project</a>, provides a powerful query language called <a href="https://grafana.com/blog/2022/05/12/10-things-you-didnt-know-about-logql/">LogQL</a>. Site reliability engineers (SREs) and other Loki experts love to use it to filter logs for specific keywords, reduce noise by selecting specific labels, and perform other operations to get answers to understand their systems.</p><p>Metrics can be created from logs, which are put into dashboards to visualize key insights. Alerts can be set up and wired into <a href="https://grafana.com/products/cloud/irm/">Grafana Incident Response &amp; Management</a> (IRM), which includes <a href="https://grafana.com/products/cloud/oncall/">Grafana OnCall</a> and <a href="https://grafana.com/products/cloud/incident/">Grafana Incident,</a> so you can make sure you get early warnings when things go wrong.</p><p>Those same queries can be used to power <a href="https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/panels-visualizations/visualizations/">Grafana dashboard visualizations</a> so you can make sense of your logs. LogQL is really powerful! There’s just one catch …</p><h2 id="but-i-dont-know-logql">‘But I don’t know LogQL!’</h2><p>If you aren’t digging into your logs every day, you might not have had a reason to learn LogQL. Perhaps you dive in now and again, or maybe only during an incident. And even in those moments, having to remember the details of a query language can slow down response times.&nbsp;</p><p>The point is, you come to your logs platform not because you love logs, but because you <em>need</em> logs to do your job. Whether you need them to see a deployment go smoothly, to investigate a latency issue, or to deal with a 4 a.m. page, the last thing you want to do is wrestle with yet another query language.&nbsp;</p><p>If only you could take advantage of all the great benefits Loki + Grafana provides, without needing to learn LogQL. Well, you guessed it: Now you can!</p><h2 id="introducing-explore-logs-a-new-oss-application">Introducing Explore Logs, a new OSS application</h2><p>Explore Logs is our new OSS application that lets you browse your logs as if they were already neatly organized for you in advance. You can find <a href="https://github.com/grafana/explore-logs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the source code on GitHub</a>, but before you head there to try it, allow us to give you a quick tour.</p><figure itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><a href="https://grafana.com/media/blog/explore-logs/explore-logs.gif" itemprop="contentUrl"><img src="https://grafana.com/media/blog/explore-logs/explore-logs.gif" alt="A GIF showing how to use Explore Logs in Grafana"></a></figure><p>When you come into Explore Logs (in the navigation, head over to <strong>Explore</strong> &gt; <strong>Logs</strong>), you are presented with a list of detected services or apps. Engineers no longer have to fight with teams across the organization to standardize on one convention. Instead, we embrace the chaos.</p><p>Services are presented along with their log volumes and a preview of recent log lines, so you can see, at a glance, which services are the most chatty and what kinds of logs they are emitting.</p><figure itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><a href="https://grafana.com/media/blog/explore-logs/recent-log-lines.png" itemprop="contentUrl"><img src="https://grafana.com/media/blog/explore-logs/recent-log-lines.png" alt="Service log volumes and a preview of recent log lines" data-src="/media/blog/explore-logs/recent-log-lines.png"></a></figure><p>Don’t see the service you are looking for? Simply search for it with the search bar (plain text search, not LogQL).</p><p>As if automatic service detection wasn’t enough, things start to get really interesting when you select a service.</p><h2 id="how-to-breakdown-logs-in-a-service">How to breakdown logs in a service&nbsp;</h2><p>Explore Logs provides tools to further visualize and breakdown a service’s logs by labels, detected fields, and patterns, all while making sure the log lines themselves are always just a click away.</p><ul><li><strong>Labels</strong> are key-value pairs that can be attached to log lines, for example: <code>level=error</code>, <code>environment=prod</code>, <code>app=nginx</code>, <code>team=loki</code></li><li><strong>Detected fields</strong> contain structured key-value pairs extracted automatically from a log line at query time.</li><li><strong>Patterns</strong> are templates automatically derived from the log stream, used to match lines of the same type. New innovations here have led to some powerful capabilities described below.</li></ul><p>Let’s explore (get it?) each of these in turn, and see how Explore Logs makes it easier than ever to make use of these features.</p><h3 id="labels">Labels</h3><p>In Loki, <a href="https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/get-started/labels/">labels</a> are key-value pairs that are used to organize and identify log streams.

For best results, we recommend that you first filter by known values (such as labels, detected fields, and time range) to narrow down the search space and make patterns more useful.</p><p>You can use pattern matching to:</p><ol><li>Understand the kinds of log lines produced by your systems</li><li>Hide noisy or irrelevant lines to quickly narrow down on what’s important</li><li>Focus on specific trends or anomalies by filtering for log lines matching one or more of the patterns</li></ol><p>Explore Logs lets you easily add multiple patterns to your filters, which will include log lines matching any of the selected patterns. You can also exclude a pattern to hide that kind of log line.</p><h4 id="example-use-case-for-pattern-matching">Example use case for pattern matching&nbsp;</h4><p>Say you’re looking for errors among a lot of HTTP traffic logs. It can be tough to spot the individual lines you’re looking for. With patterns, you can simply mute the offending lines by excluding lines of that type at the click of a button.</p><p>Consider the example log lines below. You can clearly see two distinct patterns:</p><div><pre data-expanded="false"><code>code=200 method=get path=/page1 trace_id=123

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<!-- Article Start -->
				
<p>At a small factory just north of Delhi, a welder named Ram Baran spends several hours each day training his coworkers in metal cutting, molding, and shaping bodies of three-wheeler electric vehicles.</p>



<p>Baran is not an engineer by education. He started working at the factory in 2017 as a helper — dusting, cleaning, and organizing items. A year later, he got the opportunity to upskill and get trained in welding by Chinese engineers. Nearly 80% of Baran’s 200 co-workers have followed a similar trajectory. “[They] taught us all the work,” Baran told <em>Rest of World. </em>“They taught us welding — how to put the parts and cut them<em>.</em> Over time, I picked up the work and got promoted. Now, our people can also teach these things.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Each month, this upskilled team at the factory in Sonipat — 40 kilometers from New Delhi — produces bodies and chassis for nearly 5,000 three-wheeler EVs, locally known as e-rickshaws, for the New Delhi-based YC Electric, India’s second-largest manufacturer in the segment. In 2023, YC Electric alone sold over 40,600 e-rickshaws, while <a href="https://www.smev.in/statistics">82,500<strong> </strong>electric cars</a> were sold in the country.</p>



<p>Even as India awaits its first Tesla, these humble e-rickshaws made by workers like Baran are powering an EV revolution in the country. In the last decade, around 1.73 million three-wheeler EVs have <a href="https://cleanmobilityshift.com/ev-dashboard/">been sold</a> in India. Just last month, around 500 manufacturers — most of them homegrown — sold over 44,000 e-rickshaws, compared to less than 6,800 electric cars sold during the month.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Unlike the four-wheeler and two-wheeler industries, which are controlled by popular brands like Tata, Ola, and Ather Energy, three of the top five brands in the e-rickshaw segment — YC Electric, Dilli Electric Auto, and Saera Electric —&nbsp;have little to no brand recall.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Big-name companies won’t set foot in the e-rickshaw industry,” YC Electric’s director, Pawan Kakkar, told <em>Rest of World. </em>“They know it’s not their segment. The buyer is not looking for aesthetics. [The vehicle] should be durable.”</p>



<p>YC Electric was born in 2014 out of a partnership between Kakkar and his partner Sanjeev Pahwa’s cycle-rickshaw company and a traditional <em>tuk-tuk</em> manufacturer. The founders took advantage of the Indian government’s push for local manufacturing around the time, and set up two assembly units in Noida and Kolkata. They started manufacturing in Sonipat by 2016. “I had the network, and, more importantly, I knew what cycle-rickshaw drivers need,” Kakkar said.</p>



<p>A favorable policy environment has been crucial for the three-wheeler EV revolution in India, according to Lizbeth Jibi Godwin, research associate at the Center for Public Policy and Research (CPPR). “The subsidies and exemptions from obtaining permits for EVs have made electric three-wheelers an attractive option,” Godwin told <em>Rest of World</em>. “Additionally, the increasing demand for last-mile connectivity in public transport, such as buses and metro services, has led to a rise in electric three-wheelers.”</p>



<p>Even while government policies have spurred local EV manufacturing, the industry continues to be fueled by Chinese connections for sourcing parts, technical know-how, and even training the workforce.</p>

	</figure>


<p>The Sonipat plant where YC builds its e-rickshaws is a joint venture with the company’s former Chinese import partners Jiang Li and Xue Jian Nan, who hold a 49% stake in the facility. <em>“</em>The link [with the Chinese suppliers] became so good that they also believed in us, invested money with us, and shared technology with us<em>,</em>” Kakkar said. Chinese engineers stayed “for days” to train welders like Baran when the factory first opened, he said.</p>



<p>His company’s ethos, according to Kakkar, is “Make in India, but technology from China.”</p>



<p>This dependence on China is not unique to YC Electric.</p>



<p>Saera Electric, a direct competitor of YC Electric, produces nearly 95% of its vehicles locally, but some parts, like the natural magnet for the motor and critical minerals for the battery, have to come from China because they do not naturally occur in India, Sudip Banerjee, the company’s planning and strategy head, told <em>Rest of World</em>.<em> </em>He said that things could slowly change as <a href="https://www.businesstoday.in/latest/economy/story/jharkhand-emerges-as-the-latest-hub-of-lithium-reserves-in-india-400491-2023-10-03">more lithium reserves</a> are found across the country.</p>



<p>“As far as the information available and from the disclosure cited, there is no Indian EV company completely free of China,” D Dhanuraj, founder and chairman for CPPR, told <em>Rest of World</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>“Big-name companies won’t set foot in the e-rickshaw industry; they know it’s not their segment."</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Kakkar said the company’s focus on tech has helped it reach its current scale. In the financial year ending March 2024, YC Electric clocked revenue of over 6.5 billion rupees ($78 million), Kakkar said.</p>



<p>“From the first day, we decided we’ll work on the tech. We will not treat this like a cycle rickshaw. So whatever changes were done [to the vehicle], YC Electric did it first,” Kakkar said. For instance, he said, the company customized the vehicle’s tire size and improved its suspension to meet the requirements of Indian roads. “We got the first-mover advantage. And then we took another step — to collaborate with the Chinese.”</p>



<p>The China connection, though, is often hindered by geopolitical tensions. For instance, YC’s next champion product — a high-speed electric auto like the ones its larger rival Mahindra makes — is stuck after border conflicts soured relations between the two neighbors. The development of the new vehicle — which <em>Rest of World</em> snuck a peek at while it was being tested at the Sonipat factory — has been stunted because “people are not able to come from [China]. Business visas are also not being given,” Kakkar said. India has reportedly put a <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/electronics/visa-delays-for-chinese-professionals-hit-india-businesses/articleshow/100834085.cms?from=mdr">strict visa approval process</a> in place for Chinese professionals, causing delays.</p>



<p>The Indian government has been trying to boost local production<strong> </strong>and reduce dependency on China with policies like a performance-linked incentive for manufacturing and the promotion of advanced chemistry cells for the local production of <a href="https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1946679#:~:text=In%20order%20to%20reduce%20dependency,a%20period%20of%205%20years.">lithium-ion batteries, </a>independent public transport expert Ravi Gadepalli, who works with the World Bank and Asian Development Bank, told <em>Rest of World</em>. But a long-term vision is lacking, Dhanuraj of CPPR said. He believes a lot more clarity and incentives need to be given to research institutions and private companies working on filling gaps in the domestic supply chain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At YC, meanwhile, there has been a concerted effort to bring in domestic companies to upskill staff and provide material, the Sonipat plant’s general manager, Vidya Sagar Singh, told <em>Rest of World</em>. Tata Steel and JSW Steel, industry leaders in steel manufacturing, have organized training sessions for workers at the plant, with more such workshops planned, he said. Many of the parts at YC’s Noida and Kolkata assembly plants now come from local manufacturers: seats from Jemco, tires from CEAT and MRF, and suspension from HSL Enterprises.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>
<img src="http://www.adriancourreges.com/img/blog/2015/supcom/supcom-logo.png">
</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_Annihilation">Total&nbsp;Annihilation</a> has a special place in my heart since it was the very first RTS I played;
it was with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_%26_Conquer_%281995_video_game%29">Command&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Conquer</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StarCraft">Starcraft</a> one of the best RTS released in the late 90’s.</p>
<p>10 years later – in 2007 – its successor was released: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Commander_%28video_game%29">Supreme Commander</a>.<br>
With <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Taylor_%28game_designer%29">Chris&nbsp;Taylor</a> as the designer, <a href="https://mavorsrants.blogspot.com/">Jonathan Mavor</a>
in charge of the engine programming and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Soule">Jeremy Soule</a> as the music composer (some of the main figures behind the original Total Annihilation), the expectations of the fans were very high.</p>
<p>Supreme Commander turned out to be highly praised by critics and players, with nice features like the “strategic zoom” or physically realistic ballistic.</p>
<p>So let’s see how Moho, the engine powering SupCom, renders a frame of the game! <br>
Since <a href="https://github.com/baldurk/renderdoc">RenderDoc</a> doesn’t support DirectX 9 games, reverse-engineering was done with the good old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PIX_%28Microsoft%29">PIX</a>.</p>
<h2>Terrain Structure</h2>
<p><img src="http://www.adriancourreges.com/img/blog/2015/supcom/shot/a-00-map-overview.jpg" width="200/"></p>
<p>Before we dig into the frame rendering, it’s important to first talk about how terrains are built in SupCom and which technique is used.</p>
<p>Here is an overview of “Finn’s Revenge”, a 1 versus 1 map.</p>
<p>On the left is a top-view of the entire map like it appears in-game on the mini-map.<br>
Below is the same map viewed from another angle:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.adriancourreges.com/img/blog/2015/supcom/shot/a-98.jpg"></p>
<p>First the geometry of the terrain is calculated from an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heightmap">heightmap</a>.<br>
The heightmap describes the elevation of the terrain. A white color represents a high altitude and a dark one a low altitude.<br>
For our map, a 513x513 single-channel image is used, it represents a terrain
of 10x10 km in-game. SupCom supports much larger maps, up to 81x81 km.</p>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>
<div>
<p><img src="http://www.adriancourreges.com/img/blog/2015/supcom/shot/a-03-heightmap.jpg">
</p>
<p>Heightmap</p>
</div>
</td>
<td>
<img src="http://www.adriancourreges.com/img/arrow-right.png">
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<div>
<p><img src="http://www.adriancourreges.com/img/blog/2015/supcom/shot/a-15-wireframe.jpg">
</p>
<p>Tessellated Terrain</p>
</div>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>So we have a mesh which represents our terrain.<br>
Then the game applies an albedo texture combined with a normal texture to cover all these polygons.<br>
For each map the sea level is also specified so the game modulates the albedo color of the pixels under the sea surface to give them a blue tint.</p>

<p>Sea Level Color Modulation</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Okay so having altitude-based texturing is nice, but it gets limiting quite quickly. <br>
How do we add more details and variations to our map?</p>

<p>The technique used is called “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texture_splatting">Texture splatting</a>”: the game draws a series of additional albedo+normal textures.
Each step adds what’s called a “stratum” to the terrain.<br>
We already have stratum 0: the terrain with its original albedo+color textures.<br>
To apply the next stratum, we need some extra information: a “splat&nbsp;map”, to tell us where to
draw the new albedo+normal and more importantly where not to draw! Without such a “splat&nbsp;map” also called alpha-map, applying a new stratum would completely cover the previous stratum.
The albedo and normal textures both have their own scaling factor when they are applied to the mesh.</p>

<p>So we applied strata 1, 2, 3 and 4, each one relying on 3 separate textures.
The albedo and normal textures use 3 channels (RGB) each, but the splat map uses only one channel.<br>
So as an optimization the 4 splat maps are combined into a single RGBA texture.</p>


<p>Okay so we got more texture variations for our terrain. It looks nice from far away, but if
you zoom-in you quickly notice the lack of high-frequency details.</p>
<p>This is when decals are applied: these are like small sprites which modify locally
the albedo color and the normal of a pixel. This terrain has 861 instances of 21 unique decals.</p>

<p>It’s much better but what about some vegetation?<br>
The next step is to add to the terrain what the engine calls “Props”: tree or rock models.
For this map there are 6026 instances of 23 unique models.</p>

along different directions, an environment map for reflections and sprites for the waves near the shores.</p>

<p>Our terrain is now ready.<br>
Creating good heightmaps and splat maps can be challenging for map designers, but fortunately there
are several tools to help with the task: there is the official “Supcom Map Editor” or <a href="http://www.world-machine.com/">World Machine</a> with even more advanced features.</p>
<p>So now that we know the theory behind the SupCom terrains, let’s move on to an actual frame of the game.</p>
<h2>Frame Breakdown</h2>
<p>This is the game frame we’ll dissect:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.adriancourreges.com/img/blog/2015/supcom/shot/b_95_final_frame.jpg"></p>
<h3>Frustum Culling</h3>
<p>The game has in RAM the terrain mesh, created from the heightmap, it is tessellated by the CPU and the position of each vertex is known.
When the zoom level changes, the CPU re-calculates the tessellation of the terrain. <br>
Our camera focuses on a scene near the shore. Rendering the whole terrain would be a waste of calculation, so instead the engine extracts a submesh of the whole terrain,
only the portion visible to the player, and feeds this small subset to the GPU for rendering.</p>

</div>
</div>

<h3>Normal Map</h3>
<p>First, only the normals are calculated.<br>
A first pass computes the normals resulting from the combination of the 5 stratums (5 normal maps and 4 splat maps).<br>
The different normal maps are blended together, all the operations are done in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_space">tangent space</a>.</p>

<p>This is done in a single draw call with 6 texture fetches.
You’ll notice the result is quite “yellowish”, it contrasts with the other normal maps which tend to be blue. And indeed: here the Blue channel is not used at all, only the Red and Green.<br>
But wait, a normal is a 3-component vector, how can it be stored only with 2 components? It’s actually a compression technique <a name="supcomNormalSkip"></a>(explained at <a href="#supcomNormalExpl">the end of the post</a>).<br>
For now let’s just assume the Red and Green channels contain all the information we need about the normals.</p>
<p>Stratums are done, now it’s the turn of the decals: terrain decals and building decals are added to modulate the stratum normals.</p>

<p>We still haven’t used the Blue and Alpha channels of our render target.<br>
So the game reads from a 512x512 texture representing the whole normals of the terrain (baked from the original heightmap), and calculates for each pixel its normal using a bicubic interpolation.
The results are stored in the Blue and Alpha channels.</p>

<p>Then the game combines these two sets of normals (stratum/decal normals and terrain normals) into the final normals used to calculate the lighting.</p>

</p>
<p>Final Normal Map</p>
</div>
<p>This time there’s no compression: the normals use the 3 RGB channels, one for each component.<br>
It might look very green, but this is because the scene is quite flat, the result is correct: you can take any pixel and calculate its normal vector by doing <code>colorRGB * 2.0 - 1.0</code>, you can also check that the norm of the vector is 1.</p>
<h3>Shadow Map</h3>
<p>The technique used to render the shadows is the <a href="http://www.cg.tuwien.ac.at/research/vr/lispsm/">“Light Space Perspective Shadow Maps”</a> or LiSPSM technique. <br>
Here we just have the sun as a directional light. Each mesh of the scene is rendered, and its distance from the sun is stored into the Red channel of a 1024x1024 texture.
The LiSPSM technique calculates the best projection space to maximize the precision of the shadow map.</p>


<p>If we stop here, we would just be able to draw hard shadows. When the units are rendered, the game actually tries to smooth-out the edges of the shadows
by using some <abbr title="Percentage Closer Filtering">PCF</abbr> sampling.</p>
<p>But even with PCF, there would be no way to obtain the beautiful smooth-shadows we see on the screenshot, especially the smooth silhouettes of the buildings on the ground…
So how was this achieved?</p>
<p>Even during the final parts of the development process of the game, it seems the implementation of shadows was still an on-going effort.
This is what Jonathan Mavor was saying 11 months before the game public release:</p>
<blockquote><p>The shadows in those shots are not finished and we do have a little bit of work to do on them yet. […] <br>We are not finished with the game graphically by any stretch at this point.</p></blockquote>
<p>Just one month after this declaration, a new ground-breaking shadow map technique was emerging: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201124200859/http://www.punkuser.net/vsm/">Variance Shadow Maps</a> or VSM. It was able to render
gorgeous soft shadows very efficiently. <br>
It seems the SupCom team tried to experiment with this new technique: decompiling the D3D bytecode reveals a reference to a <code>DepthToVariancePS()</code> function which computes
a blur version of the shadow map. Before VSM was invented, shadow maps could not and were never blurred. <br>
Here SupCom performs a 5x5 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_blur">Gaussian blur</a> (horizontal and vertical pass) of the shadow map.</p>

</div>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>However in the D3D bytecode, there is no instruction about storing the depth and the squared-depth (information required by the VSM technique).
It seems to be only a partial implementation: maybe there was no time to perfect the technique during the final stages of the development, but anyway the code as-is can
already produce nice results.</p>
<p>Note though that the pseudo-VSM map is used only to produce soft-shadows on the ground.<br>
When a shadow must be drawn onto a unit, it is done through the LiSPSM map with PCF sampling. You can see the difference in the screenshot below (PCF has blocky artifacts at the shadow border):</p>

<h3>Water Reflection</h3>
<p><img src="http://www.adriancourreges.com/img/blog/2015/supcom/shot/b_09_reflection_expl.png"></p>
<p>We have the sea on the right of our scene, so if a robot is sitting in the middle of the water we should be able to see its reflection on the sea surface.</p>
<p>A classic trick exists to render the reflection of a surface: an additional pass is performed, and just before applying the camera transformation, the vertical axis is scaled by -1 so
the entire scene becomes symmetric with regards to the water surface (just like a mirror) which is exactly the transformation needed to render the reflection.
SupCom uses this technique and renders all the mirrored unit meshes into a reflection map.</p>

<p>Reflection Map</p>
</div>
<h3>Mesh Rendering</h3>
<p>All the units are then rendered one by one.
For the vegetation, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry_instancing">geometry instancing</a> is used to render multiple trees in one draw call.
The sea is rendered using a single quad, with a pixel shader fetching several normal maps, a refraction map (the scene rendered up until now), a
reflection map (just generated above) and a skybox for additional reflection.</p>

<p>Notice in the last image the small black artifacts of the sea near the screen border: it’s because the sampling of the surface of the water is disrupted to create an illusion of movement.
Sometimes the disruption brings texels from outside the viewport within the viewport: but such information does not exist, hence the black areas.<br>
During the game the UI actually hides these artifacts under a thin border covering the edges of the viewport.</p>
<h3>Mesh Structure</h3>
<p>Each unit in SupCom is rendered in a single draw call. A model is defined by a set of textures:</p>
<ul>
<li>an albedo map</li>
<li>a normal map</li>
<li>a “specular map” which actually contains much more information than the specular. It’s an RGBA texture with:
<ul>
<li>Red: Reflection. How much the environment map is reflected.</li>
<li>Green: Specular. In regards to the sun light.</li>
<li>Blue: Brightness. Used later to control the bloom.</li>
<li>Alpha: Team Color. It modulates the unit albedo depending on the team color.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bloom</h3>
<p>Time to make things shine! But how do we get the “brightness information” since we’re working with <abbr title="Low Dynamic Range">LDR</abbr> buffers?<br>
The brightness map is actually contained within the alpha channel, it was being built at the same time the previous meshes were drawn.<br>
A downscaled copy of the frame is created, the alpha channel is used to make only the bright areas stand out and two successive Gaussian blurs are performed.</p>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>
<div>

</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>The blurred buffer is then drawn on the top of the original scene with additive blending.</p>

<h3>User Interface</h3>
<p>We’re done concerning the main scene. The UI is finally rendered, and it is beautifully optimized: a <em>single draw call</em> to render the entire interface.
1158 triangles are pushed at once to the GPU.</p>
<div id="b_96_wireframe">

</div>

<p>The pixel shader reads from a single 1024x1024 texture which acts like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texture_atlas">texture atlas</a>. When another unit is selected, the UI is modified,
the texture atlas is regenerated on-the-fly to pack a new set of sprites.</p>
<p>And we’re done for the frame!</p>
<h2>Additional Notes</h2>
<h3>Level of Detail</h3>
<p>Since SupCom supports huge variations in the zoom level, it relies heavily on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_detail">level of detail</a> or LOD. <br>
If the player zooms out from the map, the number of visible units quickly increases, to keep up with the increase in GPU load it becomes necessary to render simpler geometry
and smaller textures. Since the units are very far away, the engine can get away with it: models are replaced with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_poly">low-poly</a> versions,
with fewer details but they’re rendered so small on the screen that the
player can hardly see the difference with high-poly models.</p>
<div id="c_lod">
<div>
<p><img src="http://www.adriancourreges.com/img/blog/2015/supcom/shot/c_01_hp_full.jpg">
</p>

</p>
<p>LOD High - Wireframe</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>LOD does not only concern units: shadows, decals and props stop being rendered beyond a certain distance.</p>
<h3>Fog of War</h3>
<p>Because of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fog_of_war">fog of war</a>, each unit has a line of sight and only the area close to the units is completely visible.
Areas where no units are present are either gray (previously visited) or black (still unexplored).<br>
The game stores the fog information in a 128x128 mono-channel texture which defines the intensity of the fog: 1 means no visibility whereas 0 means full visibility.</p>


<h3><a name="supcomNormalExpl"></a>Normal Compression</h3>
<p><a href="#supcomNormalSkip">As promised</a>, here is a short explanation about the trick used in SupCom to compress normals. <br>
A normal is usually a 3-component vector, however in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_space">tangent space</a>, the vector is expressed relatively to the
surface tangent: X and Y are within the tangent plane while the Z component always points away from the surface.<br>
By default the normal is <code>(0, 0, 1)</code> which is why most normal maps appear bluish when the normal is not perturbed.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.adriancourreges.com/img/blog/2015/supcom/shot/a_stratum_normal_0.jpg"></p>
<p>So assuming the normal is a unit-vector, its length is one: <code>X² + Y² + Z² = 1</code>.<br>
If you know the values of X and Y, then Z can only have two possible values: <code>Z = ±√(1 - X² - Y²)</code>.<br>
But since Z always points away from the surface, it has to be positive
and so we have <code>Z = √(1 - X² - Y²)</code>.<br>
That’s why <strong>only storing X and Y in the Red and Green channels is enough</strong>, Z can be derived from them. A more detailed (and better) explanation can be
found in <a href="http://developer.download.nvidia.com/whitepapers/2008/real-time-normal-map-dxt-compression.pdf">this article</a>.</p>
<h3>Normal Blending</h3>
<p>Since we are talking about normals, SupCom performs some kind of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_interpolation">lerp</a> between normal maps, using the splatmaps as factors.
Actually there are several ways of blending two normal maps, with different results, it is not a straightforward problem like <a href="http://blog.selfshadow.com/publications/blending-in-detail/">this article</a> explains.</p>

              <p>As it’s often the case with major releases, they feel both like the end of a journey and the beginning of a new one.</p>

<p><em>Short clip showing all</em></p>
<p>Let me first cover why <a href="https://penpot.app/penpot-2.0">Penpot 2.0</a> is such an impactful release.</p>
<p>Once again, we delivered on our promise to bring developers and designers closer together. <strong>Our bold movement to build CSS Grid Layout</strong> and enable designers to create responsive interfaces matching coding constructs was unexpected. The design tool space has changed forever.</p>
<p><strong>Component Libraries have been revamped</strong> with a new data structure to help designers and large teams build extensive design systems more modularly. The addition of component swapping as well as more flexible categorisation options provide a significant boost in productivity.</p>
<p>We rebuilt the entire <strong>Penpot’s UI to be sleeker, faster and more beautiful</strong>. This will be obvious to everyone that used Penpot in the past but equally mesmerising to newcomers. Streamlining user experience means allowing for more time spent creating and collaborating at scale, which sits at the core of Penpot’s mission.</p>

<p><em>Penpot 2.0 showing an interactive prototype</em></p>
<p>Each of these features, on its own, would have deserved a major release and yet we have another three major updates.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can now use images as a fill property.</li>
<li>We added HTML generation on top of CSS and SVG.</li>
<li>UI theming is now a reality, starting with Light &amp; Dark.</li>

<p>It took the team 9 months to build and ship this amazing release. We didn’t want to cut corners, we wanted to be proud of our work so you could team up and collaborate around design and code projects with no limitations or compromises.</p>
<p>We are building our own path where concepts such as <a href="https://www.c11n.quest/does-declarative-design-foster-superior-collaboration-with-developers/">declarative design</a>, future-proof ownership of your work and a no-handoff mindset meet long-standing pragmatic design and coding practices.</p>
<p>Our SaaS service at <a href="https://design.penpot.app/">design.penpot.app</a> was the first to roll-out 2.0 a couple of days ago and <a href="https://penpot.app/self-host">self-host images</a> will follow very soon.

<p><em>Design-as-code is a reality with Penpot</em></p>
<h2><a name="whats-next-1" href="#whats-next-1"></a>What’s next?</h2>
<p>Delivering Penpot 2.0 required the product team to act almost as a sole entity so interdependencies between new features would not create bottlenecks.</p>
<p>Post 2.0 we are shifting to an “initiatives” approach where smaller autonomous teams can ship upgrades independently. “Design tokens”, “Plugin architecture”, “AI” or “E2E testing framework” are some of them.</p>

The provocation treatments evoked anger in both the groups similarly. Nevertheless, the retention group still showed significantly higher anger compared to levels at the baseline period, while the disposal group completely eliminated their anger after the disposal of the anger-written paper. These results suggest that the disposal of the paper containing ruminated anger into the trash can neutralise anger. Our interpretation is that the act of throwing the paper with ruminated anger into the trash can produces a feeling similar to the psychological existence (anger) being discarded, leading to anger elimination, since the psychological entity (anger) was disposed along with the physical object (anger-written paper).</p><p>One may argue that it was not the disposal itself but the physical distance played a critical role in reducing anger. Since the paper was distanced from participants in the disposal group, whereas the paper in the retention group was located by them.

In their study (Experiment 5), participants in avoidance action conditions either threw the ball to the opposite corner of the room (creating physical distance between themselves and the ball), or pretended to throw the ball (creating no distance between themselves and the ball). Participants in the no-avoidance action condition either carried the ball to the opposite corner of the room and left it there (creating physical distance between the self and the ball without involving a throwing action) or held the ball in their non-dominant hand (creating no distance). Participants in both avoidance action conditions reversed the negative thoughts, while participants in both no-avoidance conditions did not. Avoidance actions were crucial in their study. Therefore, the physical distance would not contribute to reduce anger in this study. However, disposal action might be the key to neutralising anger in this study. Nevertheless, we assume that the meaning (i.e. interpretation) of disposal is more important than the action itself. Other studies have also suggested that the meaning of an action is critical for determining its impact, not the action itself<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 30" title="Brinol, P., Gasco, M., Petty, R.

However, it was unclear what aspect of the paper’s disposal neutralised anger. Although we interpreted the meaning of the action as critical to neutralising anger, the physical distance between the participant and the paper or the action itself (i.e. embodied cognition) might have played a critical role. We set up the second experiment: (1) to replicate the results of Experiment 1; (2) to exclude the embodied explanation as much as possible; and (3) to explore another version of the disposal method using a shredder on the desk. In this experiment, we asked participants to put the paper containing anger into the shredder instead of throwing it into the trash can which was kept at some distance from the participants. We also made a small change to the retention group. Participants of retention group put the paper into a clear box on the desk, and the disposal group put the paper into the shredder. Thus, the distance between the participants and the paper and the type of action were matched between the two groups. If the sensorimotor experience of throwing the paper was critical to neutralise anger, we would not be able to replicate the results of Experiment 1. Nevertheless, if the meaning of the disposal of a physical entity plays a critical role in reducing anger, we anticipated obtaining similar results. In line with our prediction, the attitude changed when the paper was transferred to a box labelled ‘trash can’, which indicated mentally discarding it, compared to a box labelled ‘safety box’<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 46" title="Kim, T.

Hence, we designed a new study to confirm whether the perceived meaning of action eliminates anger.

The disposal group significantly reduced their anger after disposing of the anger-written paper into the shredder. The retention group showed significantly higher anger than the baseline period and disposal group. These results suggest that the results in Experiment 1 could be attributed neither to the physical distance between the participant and the paper nor to the action itself (i.e. embodied cognition). Specifically, Experiment 2 replicated the results of Experiment 1 and excluded the embodied explanation (the sensorimotor experience of throwing the paper) because the action of the disposal group was quite similar to that of the retention group in Experiment 2. The distance between participant and paper was the same in both groups, as the transparent box and shredder were placed on the desk.</p><h3 id="Sec23">General discussion</h3><p>This study aimed to determine whether the disposal of anger-written papers could eliminate or at least reduce subjective anger. Disposal manipulation eliminated anger, either by throwing the paper into a trash can or placing it into the shredder. We propose that this anger reduction method is quite effective, so the subjective ratings of anger resumed as much as the baseline levels. We believe that this method can be used in daily life and especially for populations characterised by extreme levels of anger and aggression in their home. The use of this method may potentially contribute to emotion socialization, as parents are the primary model for their children.</p><p>These results indicate that the sensorimotor experience of throwing paper plays a small role in reducing subjective anger<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 44" title="Zhang, Y., Risen, J.

Their experiment tested whether certain behaviors could lower the perceived likelihood of bad luck, as is often the case with jinxes. Participants who threw a ball believed that a jinxed-negative outcome was less likely than those who held the ball. They demonstrated that engaging in an avoidant action rather than creating physical distance was critical for reversing the perceived effect of the jinx. The results of Experiment 1 in this study are consistent with their results. However, we demonstrated that neither avoidance action nor physical distance was crucial in reducing subjective anger.</p><p>Our results may be related to the phenomenon of ‘backward magical contagion’<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 47" title="Rozin, P., Nemeroff, C., Wane, M. &amp; Sherrod, A.

However, these emotions are reduced when the objects are destroyed, such as throwing them in a septic tank or burning them. The phenomenon of ‘magical contagion’ or ‘celebrity contagion’ refers to the belief that the ‘essence’ of an individual can be transferred to their possessions. This backward magical contagion operates in a reversed process, where manipulating an object associated with a person is thought to impact the individuals themselves. The current study's findings may be explained by the concept of backward magical contagion, which posits that negative emotions can be transferred from others to an individual through their possessions. This study did not involve the direct mediation of other individuals. The neutralization of subjective anger through the disposal of an object may be achieved by recognizing that the physical entity, such as a piece of paper, has been diminished, thus causing the original emotion to also disappear.</p><p>At least, however, some limitations regarding this disposal method should be addressed in future studies. First, the findings of this study are based on the assumption that participants identified their subjective anger with the paper. Thus, subjective anger had gone with the anger-written paper after its disposal. The participants were asked to review the sentences carefully for 30&nbsp;s to enhance this identification between thought and paper. It is not clear whether this review process is necessary for identification.</p><p>Another limitation is that we did not test a digital device, such as a word processor or smartphone, but used only papers. We believe the present disposal method can be generalised to a digital device, whereas empirical data are limited only by physical entities, papers, trash cans, or shredders. Suppose the disposal method is proven to be effective in digital devices. In that case, it will be adopted in various situations, such as business meetings or daily conversations in schools, by writing and disposing of with a smartphone.</p><p>Furthermore, although the disposal method had a more significant effect so that the subjective ratings of anger were eliminated as much as the baseline levels, the effectiveness of this method was not directly compared to other anger reduction methods, such as self-distancing. Other methods may be as effective or even more effective than the present disposal method. Personality traits may modulate the effects of anger suppression, although this has not been examined in the techniques used in this or in other studies.

They proposed anger as not a unitary process but one that comprises multiple independent components (subjective anger and negative feelings).

It offers a cost-effective and easy-to-use method to reduce anger by rumination about the provocative event, which otherwise lasts longer. Anyone with a pen and piece of paper can use this method. Suppose one maintains a diary or a personal log. In that case, they can write down a provocative event on the day on the memo pad, and throwing it into the trash can eliminate the provocative event. This action may help neutralize the negative emotions associated with the event, potentially protecting the children’s emotional socialization.</p></div></div><div id="Sec24-section" data-title="Conclusion"><h2 id="Sec24">Conclusion</h2><p>This study presents a new and convenient method for eliminating subjective anger.

Doing so requires rethinking systems design in deep collaboration with service developers. This rethinking has resulted in our significant investment in custom silicon. Today, we are thrilled to announce the latest incarnation of this work: Google Axion Processors, our first custom Arm®</span><span>-based CPUs designed for the data center. Axion delivers industry-leading performance and energy efficiency and will be available to Google Cloud customers later this year.</span></p></span></section><section><figure><section jscontroller="SCGBie" jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/image1_Ab4940U.max-2000x2000.jpg" alt="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/image1_Ab4940U.max-2000x2000.jpg" jsname="P3Vluc" jsaction="click:HTIlC" loading="lazy"></section></figure><p><span jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md" jscontroller="YSybTb" data-track-type="" soy-skip="" ssk="5:kbe95"><p>Run general-purpose workloads on C4A for exceptional performance, energy-efficiency and advanced capabilities.</p></span></p></section><section><span jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md" jscontroller="YSybTb" data-track-type="" soy-skip="" ssk="5:kbe95"><p><span>Axion is but the latest in a long line of custom Google silicon. Since 2015 we’ve released five generations of Tensor Processing Units (TPU); in 2018 we released our first Video Coding Unit (VCU), achieving up to </span><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3445814.3446723" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>33x</span></a><span> more efficiency for video transcoding; </span><span>in 2021, we </span><a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/systems/the-past-present-and-future-of-custom-compute-at-google?e=48754805"><span>doubled-down</span></a><span> on custom compute by investing in “system on a chip” (SoC) designs, and released the </span><a href="https://blog.google/products/pixel/introducing-google-tensor/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>first of three generations</span></a><span> of Tensor chips for mobile devices.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>While our investments in compute accelerators have transformed our customers’ capabilities, general-purpose compute is and will remain a critical portion of our customers’ workloads. Analytics, information retrieval, and ML training and serving all require a huge amount of compute power. Customers and users who wish to maximize performance, reduce infrastructure costs, and meet sustainability goals have found that the rate of CPU improvements has slowed recently. Amdahl’s Law suggests that as accelerators continue to improve, general purpose compute will dominate the cost and limit the capability of our infrastructure unless we make commensurate investments to keep up.</span></p>
<p><span>Axion processors combine Google’s silicon expertise with Arm’s highest performing CPU cores to deliver instances with up to </span><span>30% better performance than the fastest general-purpose Arm-based instances available in the cloud today, up to 50% better performance and up to 60% better energy-efficiency than comparable current-generation x86-based instances<sup>1</sup>.</span><span> </span><span>That’s why we’ve already started deploying Google services like BigTable, Spanner, BigQuery, Blobstore, Pub/Sub, Google Earth Engine, and the YouTube Ads platform on current generation Arm-based servers and plan to deploy and scale these services and more on Axion soon.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Unrivaled performance and efficiency, underpinned by Titanium</strong></h3>
<p><span>Built using the Arm Neoverse</span><span><span>™</span></span><span> V2 CPU, Axion processors deliver giant leaps in performance </span><span>for general-purpose workloads like web and app servers, containerized microservices, open-source databases, in-memory caches, data analytics engines, media processing, CPU-based AI training and inferencing, and more.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Axion is underpinned b</span><span>y </span><a href="https://cloud.google.com/titanium?e=48754805"><span>Titanium</span></a><span>, a system of</span><span> purpose-built custom silicon microcontrollers and tiered scale-out offloads</span><span>. Titanium offloads take care of platform operations like networking and security, so Axion processors have more capacity and improved performance for customer workloads. Titanium also offloads storage I/O processing to </span><a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/hyperdisks"><span>Hyperdisk</span></a><span>, our new block storage service that decouples performance from instance size and that can be dynamically provisioned in real time.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><em>“Google’s announcement of the new Axion CPU marks a significant milestone in delivering custom silicon that is optimized for Google’s infrastructure, and built on our high-performance Arm Neoverse V2 platform. Decades of ecosystem investment, combined with Google’s ongoing innovation and open-source software contributions ensure the best experience for the workloads that matter most to customers running on Arm everywhere."</em> - Rene Haas, CEO, Arm</p>
<p><span>Beyond performance, customers want to operate more efficiently and meet their sustainability goals. </span><span>Google Cloud data centers are already 1.5X more efficient than the industry average and deliver 3X more computing power with the same amount of electrical power compared with five years ago<sup>2</sup>.</span><span> </span><span>We’ve set ambitious </span><a href="https://sustainability.google/operating-sustainably/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>goals</span></a><span> to </span><span>operate our offices, campuses, and data centers on carbon-free energy, 24/7</span><span>, and offer </span><a href="https://cloud.google.com/carbon-footprint"><span>tools</span></a><span> to help you report on carbon emissions. With Axion processors, customers can optimize for even more energy-efficiency.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Google also has a rich history of contributions to the Arm ecosystem. We built and open sourced Android, Kubernetes, Tensorflow and the Go language, and worked closely with Arm and industry partners to optimize them for the Arm architecture.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Axion is built on the standard Armv9 architecture and instruction set. Most recently, we contributed to SystemReady Virtual Environment (VE), Arm’s hardware and firmware interoperability standard that ensures common operating systems and software packages can seamlessly run on Arm-based servers and VMs, making it easier for customers to deploy Arm workloads on Google Cloud with limited-if-any code rewrites. Through this collaboration, we’re accessing an ecosystem of tens of thousands of cloud customers already deploying workloads and leveraging Arm-native software from hundreds of ISVs and open-source projects.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Customers will be able to use Axion in many Google Cloud services including Google Compute Engine, Google Kubernetes Engine, Dataproc, Dataflow, Cloud Batch, and more.&nbsp; Arm-compatible software and solutions are now available on the </span><a href="https://cloud.google.com/marketplace?hl=en"><span>Google Cloud Marketplace</span></a><span>, and we've recently launched preview support for Arm-based instances migration in the </span><a href="https://cloud.google.com/migrate/virtual-machines"><span>Migrate to Virtual Machines</span></a><span> service.</span></p>

Excitement was obvious in Mexico, several US states, and Canada during the total solar <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse_of_April_8,_2024">eclipse</a> that occurred on April 8, 2024. Dubbed the Great North American Eclipse, millions gathered outdoors to witness the Moon pass between Earth and the Sun, casting darkness over fortunate states. Amidst the typical gesture of putting the eclipse glasses on and taking them off, depending on if people were looking at the sky during the total eclipse, or before or after, what happened to Internet traffic?</p><p>Cloudflare’s data shows a clear impact on Internet traffic from Mexico to Canada, following the path of totality. The eclipse occurred between 15:42 UTC and 20:52 UTC, moving from south to north, as seen in this <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/eclipses/future-eclipses/eclipse-2024/">NASA image</a> of the path and percentage of darkness of the eclipse.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2024/04/nasaimage.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1600" height="1299"></figure><p>Looking at the <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/us">United States</a> in aggregate terms, bytes delivered traffic dropped by 8%, and request traffic by 12% as compared to the previous week at 19:00 UTC (14:00 Eastern, 12:00 Pacific).</p><figure><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2024/04/cloudflare-radar-traffic-trends-xy-20240408-20240408--1--2.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2048" height="1152"><figcaption>Bytes delivered percentage change (-8% at 19:00 UTC)</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2024/04/percchange-eclipse-2024-04-08-at-22.27.27.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2106" height="648"><figcaption>HTTP requests percentage change (-12% at 19:00 UTC)</figcaption></figure><p>The state-level perspective in terms of traffic drop at the time of the eclipse, as compared to the previous week, is much more revealing. Here’s a summary of the US states' traffic changes. We can almost trace the path of the eclipse, as shown in the previous NASA image.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2024/04/Eclipse-US-2024-04-08-at-23.45.02-1.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2244" height="1546"></figure><p>From our data, Vermont, Arkansas, Indiana, Maine, New Hampshire, and Ohio experienced traffic drops of 40% or more around the time of the eclipse. These states were all in the path of totality, which was not the case for several others.</p><p>In the next table, we provide a detailed breakdown of the same perspective shown on the US map ordered by drop in traffic. In all of these charts, we're using UTC as the time. We include the time of the biggest traffic drop compared to the previous week, at a 5-minute granularity, and also the percentage of drop compared to the previous week. States where it was possible to see at least part of the total eclipse are highlighted in <strong>bold</strong>.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><article itemprop="text"><p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">SSSL - Hackless SSL bypass for the Wii U</h2><a id="user-content-sssl---hackless-ssl-bypass-for-the-wii-u" aria-label="Permalink: SSSL - Hackless SSL bypass for the Wii U" href="#sssl---hackless-ssl-bypass-for-the-wii-u"></a></p>

	<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/PretendoNetwork/SSSL/blob/master/shutter.png"><img src="https://github.com/PretendoNetwork/SSSL/raw/master/shutter.png"></a></p></div>
<p dir="auto">On March 1, 2021 Nintendo released Wii U firmware version <a href="https://wiiubrew.org/wiki/5.5.5" rel="nofollow">5.5.5</a>. This update updated the Wii U's SSL verification and recompiled all RPLs (though no code changes were made). The exact purpose for this update is unknown, as nothing of significance was changed, and no other changes were made in this update. With the changes to SSL verification, Nintendo introduced a bug which allows for the forging of SSL certificates. These forged certificates will be seen as "Nintendo Signed" and, due to an existing bug with how the Wii U handles CA common names, will be accepted by all domains.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">The bugs</h2><a id="user-content-the-bugs" aria-label="Permalink: The bugs" href="#the-bugs"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">There are 2 bugs at play:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Normally a CA common name does not accept a single wildcard (*) value. They must contain a hostname, and optionally one or many wildcards for subdomains. The Wii U will accept a single * wildcard in place of a hostname, which allows the CA to be accepted as any domain. This bug has existed since before 5.5.5, but was not useful until now.</li>
<li>As of 5.5.5, CA's crafted in a specific way may take a newly introduced alternate path for verification. This allows for a CA's signature to not be verified correctly. Instead, the Wii U simply checks if the CA matches one already known by the system, but not the signature or contents of the CA. We have no idea why this change was made, as it does not benefit Nintendo at all. It almost feels intentional.</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Exploiting</h2><a id="user-content-exploiting" aria-label="Permalink: Exploiting" href="#exploiting"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Not any CA will work. There are 3 conditions for a CA which still need to be met even for a forged CA to be accepted:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>The CA needs to be one which the Wii U would already accept. The signature is not validated in this case, so modifying an existing CA works.</li>
<li>The Wii U does not allow a Root CA in the cert chain. It will ignore any certs that have a matching subject and authority key.</li>
<li>The title must not roll it's own SSL. WebKit titles such as the eShop, Miiverse, TVii, etc, as well as any game which uses it's own SSL library, will not work with these certificates.</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">The easiest way to exploit this bug is to use the Nintendo CA - G3 CA, and is what this script opts to do. This can be dumped from a Wii U's SSL certificates title at <code>/storage_mlc/sys/title/0005001b/10054000/content/scerts/CACERT_NINTENDO_CA_G3.der</code>. Changing the public key to a user-controlled key and changing the authority key identifier to anything else is all that is required. The resulting user-controlled private key and patched CA can be used to bypass SSL verification without any homebrew or CFW at all.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">The script</h2><a id="user-content-the-script" aria-label="Permalink: The script" href="#the-script"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">This script takes in a PEM encoded copy of Nintendo CA - G3 and does the above patches and exports the patched CA and private key.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Install <a href="https://nodejs.org/" rel="nofollow">NodeJS</a></li>
<li><code>git clone https://github.com/PretendoNetwork/SSSL</code></li>
<li><code>cd SSSL</code></li>
<li><code>npm i</code> to install the dependencies</li>
<li><code>node patch</code> to run the patching wizard</li>
</ul>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://github.com/nalgeon/sqlime">https://github.com/nalgeon/sqlime</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39977231">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><article itemprop="text"><p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Sqlime</h2><a id="user-content-sqlime" aria-label="Permalink: Sqlime" href="#sqlime"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><strong><a href="http://sqlime.org/" rel="nofollow">Sqlime</a></strong> is an online SQLite playground for debugging and sharing SQL snippets. Kinda like JSFiddle, but for SQL instead of JavaScript.</p>
<p dir="auto">🌟 <strong>New!</strong> Turn static SQL code in your articles into <a href="https://codapi.org/sqlite/" rel="nofollow">interactive examples</a>.</p>
<a href="https://sqlime.org/" rel="nofollow">
    <img src="https://github.com/nalgeon/sqlime/raw/main/img/sqlime.jpg" alt="Sqlime" width="600">
</a>
<p dir="auto">Here are some notable features:</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">🔋 Full-blown database in the browser</h3><a id="user-content--full-blown-database-in-the-browser" aria-label="Permalink: 🔋 Full-blown database in the browser" href="#-full-blown-database-in-the-browser"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Sqlime is backed by the latest version of SQLite via the <a href="https://github.com/nalgeon/sqlean.js">sqlean.js</a> project. It provides a full-featured SQL implementation, including indexes, triggers, views, transactions, CTEs, window functions and execution plans.</p>
<p dir="auto">It also includes essential SQLite extensions, from math statistics and regular expressions to hash functions and dynamic SQL.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">🔌 Connect any data source</h3><a id="user-content--connect-any-data-source" aria-label="Permalink: 🔌 Connect any data source" href="#-connect-any-data-source"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Connect any local or remote SQLite database. Both files and URLs are supported. For example, try loading the <a href="http://sqlime.org/#https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nalgeon/sqliter/main/employees.en.db" rel="nofollow">Employees&nbsp;database</a> from the GitHub repo.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">🔗 Save and share with others</h3></p>
<p dir="auto">Sqlime saves both the database and the queries to GitHub so that you can revisit them later or share them with a colleague. The database is stored as a plain text SQL dump, so it's easy to read the code or import data into PostgreSQL, MySQL, or other databases.</p>
<p dir="auto">For example, here is the <a href="https://gist.github.com/nalgeon/e012594111ce51f91590c4737e41a046">gist</a> for the Employees database, and here is the <a href="https://sqlime.org/#gist:e012594111ce51f91590c4737e41a046" rel="nofollow">sharing&nbsp;link</a> for it.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">🤖 Ask AI</h3><a id="user-content--ask-ai" aria-label="Permalink: 🤖 Ask AI" href="#-ask-ai"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Connect an OpenAI account to get help with your queries from the state-of-the-art ChatGPT assistant. AI can explain, teach, and troubleshoot your SQL.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/nalgeon/sqlime/blob/main/img/sqlime-ai.jpg"><img src="https://github.com/nalgeon/sqlime/raw/main/img/sqlime-ai.jpg" alt="Ask AI" width="600"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">📱 Mobile friendly</h3><a id="user-content--mobile-friendly" aria-label="Permalink: 📱 Mobile friendly" href="#-mobile-friendly"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Most playgrounds are not meant for small screens. Sqlime was specifically designed and tested on mobile devices. No need to zoom or aim at tiny buttons — everything looks and works just fine.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">🔒 Secure and private</h3><a id="user-content--secure-and-private" aria-label="Permalink: 🔒 Secure and private" href="#-secure-and-private"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">There is no server. Sqlime works completely in the browser. GitHub and OpenAI credentials are also stored locally. Queries are saved as private GitHub gists within your account. Your data is yours only.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">⌨️ Dead simple</h3><a id="user-content-️-dead-simple" aria-label="Permalink: ⌨️ Dead simple" href="#️-dead-simple"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Sqlime has zero third-party dependencies other than SQLite. Good old HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS — that's all. No frameworks, no heavy editors, no obsolete and vulnerable libraries. Just some modular open-source code, which is easy to grasp and extend.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Last but not least</h2><a id="user-content-last-but-not-least" aria-label="Permalink: Last but not least" href="#last-but-not-least"></a></p>

   <p>One day about 20 years ago, Tom Noffsinger experienced every woodworker's worst nightmare: One final cut on his table saw before knocking off for the day turned into a trip to the emergency room. It was afternoon, and he'd been in his shop since morning.</p>   <p>"I was a little tired. I should've quit," Noffsinger says. "I ran my hand right into the blade and nearly cut my thumb off."</p>   <p>Table saws are widely considered the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2010/07/05/127780027/sharp-edge-one-mans-quest-to-improve-saw-safety">most dangerous power tool</a>, and approximately <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/05/12/2017-09098/safety-standard-addressing-blade-contact-injuries-on-table-saws#:~:text=In%202015%2C%20there%20were%20an,contact%20with%20the%20saw%20blade.">30,000</a> blade-contact injuries<strong> </strong>require medical treatment each year in the United States. About 4,000 result in amputations that can be career-ending for some professional carpenters and contractors. The Consumer Product Safety Commission says that when a person is hospitalized, the societal cost per table saw injury exceeds $500,000 when you also factor in loss of income and pain and suffering.</p>

   <p>Noffsinger was lucky by comparison. Although he needed 14 stitches, doctors at a hospital near his home in Raleigh, N.C., were able to save his thumb. Reconstructive surgery followed. Even so, all these years later, he says he still has recurring pain.</p>   <div id="res1241402767">

   <p>Woodworking has been a nearly lifelong passion for Noffsinger, and he was no stranger to power tools. Back before his accident, he'd seen a demonstration of a new and much safer type of table saw at a local woodworking store. Marketed under the name SawStop, it was designed to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYLAi4jwXcs">stop and retract the spinning blade</a> within a few milliseconds of making contact with flesh — fast enough to turn a potentially life-changing injury into little more than a scratch. Noffsinger's table saw wasn't equipped with the high-tech safety feature because manufacturers aren't required to include it.</p>

        </p>
</div>   <p>But that may be about to change. The federal Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) appears poised to mandate a SawStop-type safety brake on all new table saws sold in the United States. The move would follow years of failed efforts and false starts by the agency to impose such a standard.</p>   <p>Manufacturers have consistently fought a new rule, saying it would raise the price of table saws for consumers. Safety advocates liken it to air bags in cars and argue that the benefits outweigh the costs.</p>   
   <p>Over the years, Republicans on the commission have sided with the power tool industry in opposing further regulations. But with new Biden administration appointees, proponents on the commission appear to have a majority. In October, the CPSC <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/12/11/2023-27133/safety-standard-addressing-blade-contact-injuries-on-table-saws-notice-of-extension-of-comment#:~:text=On%20October%2018%2C%202023%2C%20the,closes%20on%20January%202%2C%202024.">voted</a> to move forward on the mandate, which is expected to get approval later this year.</p>   <p>"We've got a [proposed] rule that is designed to prevent tens of thousands of medically treated table saw injuries per year," says CPSC Commissioner Richard Trumka Jr. "That's something that I very much support."</p>   <h3>Proponents say a new standard is long overdue</h3>   <p>Former acting CPSC Chairman Robert Adler says a standard requiring a blade brake "is long, long overdue." An average of more than 10 people per day in the U.S. suffer amputations on these types of saws, and "that is staggering when you think about it," he says. "I'm so thrilled to see it's very likely to occur now."</p>   <p>Adler, who was appointed by President Barack Obama in 2009 and served on the commission for 12 years, is a veteran of the fight for a new table saw safety standard. He calls the failure to require this type of feature on saws "the greatest single frustration I felt" while on the commission. He says that's because table saws are far and away the most dangerous tool that most Americans ever buy.</p>   <p>SawStop's competitors are represented by the <a href="https://www.powertoolinstitute.com/">Power Tool Institute</a>, the trade group that includes big power-tool makers such as Bosch, DeWalt and Milwaukee, as well as lesser-known brands. The group maintains that the new safety rule would be an overreach.</p>   <p>"Small manufacturers may go out of business," Susan Orenga, the Power Tool Institute's executive manager, said at a public hearing on the new rule in February. Requiring the safety brake would raise the cost of table saws too much, she said. "Sales of table saws will decrease, resulting in unemployment, and the government could be creating a monopoly."</p>   
   <p>The industry has long maintained that since SawStop owns patents surrounding the safety technology, the company would unduly benefit from such a government-imposed standard. But at the same hearing where Orenga spoke, SawStop pledged to allow manufacturers to produce safer saws regardless of those patents.</p>   <h3>Table saw safety comes at a price</h3>   <p>Exactly how much the safety brake would add to the price of a saw is unclear. An entry-level SawStop retails for $899. A comparable saw without the safety technology goes for several hundred dollars less.</p>   <p>But with the economies of scale enjoyed by larger competitors, the price difference could be narrower down the road.</p>   <div id="res1241403640">

   <p>Since <a href="https://www.sawstop.com/company/#:~:text=The%20technology%20was%20invented%20by,SawStop%20Table%20Saw%20was%20sold.">SawStop came onto the market in 2004</a>, tens of thousands of the company's table saws have been sold in the U.S., and the company estimates that this has saved tens of thousands of professional and hobbyist woodworkers from injury.</p>   <p>The key to the SawStop is its <a href="https://www.sawstop.com/service-tips/active-injury-mitigation-aim-system-and-brake-cartridge-replacement-for-the-compact-table-saw-cts/">active injury mitigation</a> (AIM) system, which sends a small electrical charge through the saw blade, and because skin is conductive, the system senses whether the blade is touched. Basically, wood doesn't conduct electricity, but people do. When a hand comes in contact with the blade on a SawStop, this triggers a brake to stop the blade from spinning. This occurs so quickly that there's not enough time for a serious injury.</p>   <p>Sally Greenberg, executive director of the National Consumers League, has been interested in table saw safety since first hearing about the SawStop technology on <a href="https://www.npr.org/2004/12/07/4182602/table-saw-technology-aims-to-save-fingers">NPR</a> in 2004. Like Adler, she has been frustrated by the slow progress on a new safety standard.</p>   <p>"This is a category of product that could be made in this case 100% safe, but because of industry foot-dragging and resistance and lobbying power in Congress and with agencies, you have a situation of two steps forward, one step back," she says.</p>   
   <p>Until recently, SawStop competitors were largely prevented from developing AIM-type technology by a web of patents now owned by German-based TTS Tooltechnic Systems, which bought SawStop in 2017. But 20 years after the first SawStop was sold, most of those patents have now expired.</p>   <h3>SawStop vows to free up a key patent for rivals</h3>   <p>However, one key patent — the "840" patent — is not set to expire until 2033. To stave off potential competitors, it describes the AIM technology very broadly. In a surprise move at February's CPSC hearing, TTS Tooltechnic Systems North America CEO Matt Howard announced that the company would "dedicate the 840 patent to the public" if a new safety standard were adopted. Howard says that this would free up rivals to pursue their own safety devices or simply copy SawStop's. At the hearing, he challenged them "to get in the game."</p>   
   
<!-- END ID="RES1242019064" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>Howard's concession follows years of bad blood between SawStop and the larger power tool companies. Before starting SawStop, the inventor of its technology, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2011/05/25/136617222/advocates-urge-lawmakers-to-make-table-saws-safer">Steve Gass</a> — himself a patent attorney — tried to interest manufacturers in licensing his idea. He got no takers. And years later, when Bosch Power Tools began selling a saw with its own version of an injury-mitigation system, SawStop <a href="https://www.sawstop.com/news/sawstop-sues-bosch-to-protect-inventions/">won a patent-infringement suit </a>against the company. TTS subsequently agreed to let Bosch sell the saw, but Bosch never reintroduced it to the U.S. market.</p>   <p>That lawsuit, however, has been cited by the industry to buttress its claim that any move to develop similar safety features would be aggressively met by SawStop and TTS.</p>   <p>There are other industry objections as well. Orenga notes that manufacturers already comply with a voluntary standard requiring blade guards and anti-kickback features designed to prevent a blade from catching a piece of wood and throwing it violently back at the operator.</p>   <h3>"Flimsy, poorly functioning guards" don't help</h3>   <p>But according to the CPSC, it's common for table saw users to "<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/11/01/2023-23898/safety-standard-addressing-blade-contact-injuries-on-table-saws">remove modular blade guards</a>," often for reasons of "improved visibility" — in other words, because they can't easily see the cut they are trying to make.</p>   
   <p>As a result, the CPSC says, it has seen no discernible change in the number of blade-contact injuries since the industry adopted a voluntary requirement for improved blade guards and other safety features in 2010. In short, the voluntary standard "doesn't adequately reduce the risk of injury," Trumka says, which is why the commission is pursuing a mandatory standard.</p>   <p>Jim Hamilton, who hosts a popular <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@StumpyNubs">woodworking channel on YouTube</a>, says most table saw injuries could be prevented if woodworkers consistently used a blade guard. "Sadly, a culture has developed around many power tools, including table saws, that suggests safety devices are unnecessary or obstructive," he says, noting that even "veteran workers, including those who have worked at the highest levels of their trade, are seriously injured every day."</p>   <p>The situation is made worse, Hamilton says, by manufacturers including "flimsy, poorly functioning guards" that actually encourage users to remove them.</p>   <h3>Table saws cause a "vaporizing" type of injury</h3>   <p>Richard Bodor, a San Diego-based plastic surgeon, is all too familiar with the kind of catastrophic hand injuries that saw blades can cause.</p>   <p>The one he remembers most vividly occurred about 25 years ago, before SawStops were on the market. While he was operating one night to replant an amputated finger, the emergency room called about another "four-finger replant" being referred from Bodor's colleague — a senior surgeon and mentor. At first, Bodor thought his colleague was simply inquiring about another patient. He soon realized it was the surgeon himself who was injured.</p>   <p>That surgeon had been operating a table saw when his glove caught the saw blade and pulled in his hand. Bodor says the injured surgeon was surprisingly calm during pre-op, as the two discussed the complicated procedure to reconstruct the man's mangled hand.</p>   
   
<!-- END ID="RES1242011842" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>Referring to each of his shredded fingers, the injured surgeon applied his own expertise to the reconstruction. "'I think this finger is going to make it. Now, I'm a little worried about this guy. However, I think this small one might be toast,'" Bodor said, recalling their conversation.</p>   <p>After a long recovery, Bodor said, the man eventually was able to resume surgeries. But these types of saw injuries are especially challenging and difficult to repair, he says. Unlike a clean amputation from a sharp cooking knife, he explains, a table saw blade actually obliterates the tissue. "It's a vaporizing type of injury," he says, adding that replantation typically requires hours of meticulous microsurgery.</p>   
   <p>But not everyone is convinced that a new safety standard alone will prevent such devastating injuries. Dale Juntunen owns a contracting firm in Deer River, Minn., that has been building homes for more than 40 years. "In all the years I've been in business, we've never had anybody get hurt" on a table saw, he says.</p>   <p>"If it's mandated, you're going to have people hanging on to their old saws forever," Juntunen says. "And, you know, that's when I'd say there will be more injuries on an old saw."</p>   <div id="res1241403994">

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-testid="ArticlePageChunks"><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>The tech giants have overthrown capitalism. That’s the argument of former Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis, who became famous trying to defend debt-laden Greece from its German creditors. Varoufakis has never quite regained the notoriety of 2015. But he has remained a prominent left-wing voice. After a failed campaign for a seat in the European Parliament in 2019, he plans to run again this June. This time, his adversary isn’t Berlin or the banks. It’s the tech companies he accuses of warping the economy while turning people against one other.</p><div data-testid="GenericCallout"><figure><p><span>Courtesy of Penguin Random House</span></p></figure></div><p>Varoufakis is also a prolific author; his 17th book, written as a letter to his techno-curious father, chronicles the evolution of capitalism from the 1960s advertising boom, through Wall Street in the 1980s, to the 2008 financial crisis and the pandemic. In its most compelling stretches, <a data-offer-url="https://www.amazon.com/Technofeudalism-Killed-Capitalism-Yanis-Varoufakis/dp/1685891241" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Technofeudalism-Killed-Capitalism-Yanis-Varoufakis/dp/1685891241&quot;}" href="https://www.amazon.com/Technofeudalism-Killed-Capitalism-Yanis-Varoufakis/dp/1685891241" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Technofeudalism</em></a> argues that Apple, Facebook, and Amazon have changed the economy so much that it now resembles Europe’s medieval feudal system. The tech giants are the lords, while everyone else is a peasant, working their land for not much in return.</p><p>To Varoufakis, every time you post on X, formerly Twitter, you’re essentially toiling Elon Musk’s estate like a medieval serf. Musk doesn't pay you. But your free labor pays him, in a sense, by increasing the value of his company. On X, the more active users there are, the more people can be shown advertising or sold subscriptions. On Google Maps, he argues, users improve the product—alerting the system to traffic jams on their route.</p><p>The feudal comparison isn’t novel. But <em>Technofeudalism</em> attempts to introduce the idea to a wider audience. Its US release, launched the month before regulators in the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/doj-sues-apple-antitrust/">US</a> and <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/apple-meta-alphabet-eu-digital-markets-act/">European Union</a> simultaneously initiated antitrust actions against Apple, also had impeccable timing.</p><p>Over Zoom, I spoke to Varoufakis, from his home near Athens, about how the tech giants have changed the economy—and why we should care about it.</p><p><em>This interview has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p><p><strong>WIRED: That word, <em>technofeudalism</em>, what does it mean? How is the feudal system relevant here?</strong></p><p><strong>Yanis Varoufakis:</strong> Profit drives capitalism, rent drove feudalism. Now we have moved [from one system to the other] because of this new form of super-duper, all-singing, all-dancing capital: cloud capital, algorithmic capital. If I'm right, that is creating new digital fiefdoms like Amazon.com, like Airbnb, where the main mode of wealth extraction comes in the form not of profit but of rent.</p><p>Take the Apple Store. You are producing an app, Apple can withhold 30 percent of your profits [through a commission fee]. That's a rent. That's like a ground rent. It's a bit like the Apple Store is a fiefdom. It's a cloud fiefdom, and Apple extracts a rent exactly as in feudalism. So my argument is not that we went back from capitalism to feudalism. My argument is that we have progressed forward to a new system, which has many of the characteristics of feudalism, but it is one step ahead of capitalism. To signal that, I added the word <em>techno</em>.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p><strong>When you're talking about these digital fiefdoms, the idea is easier to understand in terms of platforms that take a cut of the sales, like the Apple App Store or Amazon. But can you also accuse other platforms of operating these digital fiefs, like Facebook?</strong></p><p>Facebook is a classic cloud fief. It creates cloud capital which is attractive to you, to me, to other people who want to communicate with each other—to find friends, or post their views, or news about their dog or their cat. So you're drawn into this fiefdom, and then the next step for Zuckerberg was to draw into the same fiefdom publishers and advertisers in order to sell them the attention of users. And then immediately after that, as Cory Doctorow so beautifully describes through his concept of <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/tiktok-platforms-cory-doctorow/">enshittification</a>, you're a publisher, you feel great because your sales go up through Facebook, and then suddenly, you find that you've been downgraded. And then you have to pay a higher cloud rent in order to be re-upgraded [paying for ads, for example, for customers to find your product]. That’s typical cloud capitalism, producing technofeudalism.</p><p><strong>I understand technofeudalism as affecting three groups of people. Can we boil down who is affected into these groups?</strong></p><p>Yes, and I've given them names. The company that produces the electric bicycles sold on Alibaba or Amazon.com, this is a vassal capitalist. Most of the profit margin for that company is skimmed off by Jeff Bezos [Amazon’s founder and executive chairman] in the form of cloud rent.</p><p>Second is cloud proles, or cloud proletarians. Look at the workers in Amazon warehouses who are monitored by algorithms.</p><p>And the third one is you and me. I call us cloud serfs. Because the parallel with the serfs is that we <em>volunteer</em> free labor. It doesn't matter whether we're enjoying it or not. Every time you upload a video on Tiktok, on Facebook, on Instagram, you're adding to the capital stock of these companies. We are adding to it directly through our labor or our movement or our existence. In that way we're serfs, but we are more than serfs, we’re cloud serfs producing capital. And that has never happened in the history of the world.</p><p><strong>A company like Apple might argue that instead of being a fiefdom, maybe the Apple App Store is more like a mall where companies have to rent their stores from whomever owns the building. How is technofeudalism different from the mall dynamic?</strong></p><p>Well, hugely. Say you and I were going into partnership together with a fashion brand. We go to the shopping mall and we hire a shop, the rent is fixed. It is not proportional to our sales. The more money we make, the higher our price-to-rent margin. With the Apple Store, they get 30 percent of all sales. That’s not at all the same thing. That is the equivalent of the ground rent that the feudal lord used to extract from vassal capitalists.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p><strong>What makes cloud capitalism a worse economic system than capitalism?</strong></p><p>The first thing is from a macroeconomic perspective. When you have such a large sum of money extracted in the form of cloud rent, that money disappears from a circular flow of income. According to my calculations, between 35 and 40 percent of GDP is being siphoned off the circular flow of income by cloud rent, and that means there is less money in the economy. Investment is low, and that means less good, quality jobs in the rest of the economy.</p><p>The second reason is that this cloud capital is designed to reproduce itself through our attention and through our free labor. And platforms discovered that we spend more time doing this, producing free cloud capital for the owners of cloud capital, if we're angry. So algorithms are primed to poison our conversations. That is highly detrimental to our democracies because consensus is really bad for cloud capital. It doesn't want it. It wants you and me to be angry and shouting at each other.</p><p>Now, as a professor, I have noticed the effect on kids in universities in Britain, in Australia, here in Greece, in America. I find that students today are too scared of having a face-to-face conversation. They want a safe space. They do not want any challenging ideas to be presented to them in class. They protest, they will have you thrown out of university if you say something that upsets them, about anything. But give them a phone and they become toxic and ballistic. Now, that is no way of running a democracy or a civilized society for that matter.</p><p><strong>People have already expressed dissatisfaction with capitalism in various protest movements across Europe. Why should they care that there's been a shift to a slightly different system that's dominated by a slightly different kind of company?</strong></p><p>Ordinary people need to know the reasons behind the discontent. The discontented always ask: Why is this happening? Giving them an answer, in a way that makes sense to them, is hugely empowering. This is the foundation of any possibility of democracy. Because to have democracy, it's not enough to be able to vote every four or five years. You need people who understand what is going on, who are informed about the causes of their discontent. Because if they don't understand the causes of their discontent, then it's easy for them to fall prey to xenophobia, to misogyny, to racism. Then they can say, it’s the Jew. It's the Muslim. It's the foreigner. It's the Brit. It's the German, whatever. Then people latch on to simple solutions, which is the beginning of fascism.</p><p><strong>Are we at the beginning of fascism? And if so, is that really technofeudalism’s fault?</strong></p><p>I think that fascism is already on the rise. In France almost <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/france/20220425-victory-in-defeat-le-pen-raises-far-right-s-glass-ceiling-fails-to-crack-it">45 percent</a> of the population are supporting a neofascist [Marine Le Pen]. In Italy, we have a neofascist prime minister, Giorgia Meloni. That was not the doing of technofeudalism, because technofeudalism came later. What happened is, the rise of cloud capital and the siphoning off of money from the circular flow of income increases the discontent within people. At the same time you have the algorithms which make money and accumulate cloud capital to the extent that we hate one another. Hate is the fuel of facism. So if you blend discontent, the fact that most people can’t make ends meet, and you throw in there the hatred that is reinforced by the algorithms, that's fascism.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p><strong>So if we have this new system that is fueling a new fascism, then what should we do about it?</strong></p><p>Well, many things. But to begin with, let's understand where we are, so we don't blame the foreigners. We don't blame women. We don't blame trans people. A little bit of knowledge goes a long way towards recreating the circumstances for a decent conversation between us.</p><p>In economic terms, we need to introduce a cloud tax immediately. Tax Amazon 5 percent for every transaction that takes place on its platform. Then, introduce a capacity for you and me to own a digital identity so we don't need Google or Facebook to vouch for who we are on the internet. Having a state-issued digital identity will go a long way towards restoring or handing you property rights over your data, because at the moment you do not own your data.</p><p>You can introduce interoperability. I am on X. I can't go to Bluesky. Let's say that Elon Musk decides to block me because I said something he didn't like. He has blocked me before for a couple of weeks. Now, I have more than a million followers on X. I cannot leave without losing them. If I go to Bluesky, I have 10 followers. Interoperability would mean that if I go to another platform, to Bluesky, when I post something on Bluesky, then my 1 million followers on X can hear it.</p><p><strong>It’s interesting you mention interoperability, because that’s one of the proposals in the EU's Digital Markets Act, which feels like it’s at least trying to get at some of the problems you've outlined. Do you think it goes far enough?</strong></p><p>No, it certainly doesn't go far enough. There are some interesting ideas in there, like interoperability. But nobody in government is actually working on this. This is my problem. Not that it is a hard task, but there is nobody working on it, because they don't care. They are all in the pockets of the big technofeudal lords, as I call them.</p><p><strong>So if you believe no one in government is doing anything, how do you move forward from that?</strong></p><p>That's a very good question. I have no idea. But this is why—against my spirit, against my preferences and my desires—I'm still in politics, because there is no alternative to politics.</p></div></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><h5>April 9, 2024</h5><p>This post is a continuation of my journey to build a complete computer system using discrete logic components. At this point I have made a computer capable of running network applications like an HTTP server or a LAN game.</p><p>Last year I built <a href="https://qdiv.dev/posts/eth-to-spi">a physical level adapter</a> which converts a 10BASE-T Ethernet signal to SPI and back. Back then I used an STM32 microcontroller to test its operation, now I’m implementing a MAC layer module to connect it to my <a href="https://qdiv.dev/posts/ccpu">homebrew computer</a>.</p><p>Both adapters are full-duplex and have independent transmitter and receiver parts.</p><p><img src="https://qdiv.dev/eth2/overview-eth.jpg" alt="Discrete logic computer">

<em>The new module with PHY shield removed. Bodge wires fix swapped SCK and MOSI.</em></p><h2 id="receiver">Receiver
<a href="#receiver">#</a></h2><p>Summary of receiver operation:</p><ul><li>SPI serial data is converted to bytewise parallel data, byte clock is extracted;</li><li>First 6 bytes are checked against destination MAC address criteria, unmatched frames are rejected;</li><li>Bytes are written into a static RAM buffer;</li><li>When a frame ends, receiver is disabled and further frames are rejected until user re-arms the receiver. Byte counter is stopped, its value is made accessible to the user.</li></ul><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_check_sequence">FCS</a> is not checked in hardware.</p><h3 id="data-collection">Data collection
<a href="#data-collection">#</a></h3><p>Firstly, serial SPI data needs to be converted into a stream of bytes.</p><p><img src="https://qdiv.dev/eth2/receiver.png" alt="Receiver"></p><p>Serial data is shifted into a shift register (<code>U32</code>). <code>U30</code> and <code>U31</code> count bits and bytes respectively. Static RAM write signal <code>recv_buf_we</code> is formed using a D flip-flop <code>U29B</code>. This signal briefly becomes low after each 8 bits of input data:</p><p><img src="https://qdiv.dev/eth2/recv_buf_we.svg" alt="recv_buf_we"></p><p>Received bytes are written into a 2 kB static RAM buffer 6116 (<code>U20</code>).</p><p><img src="https://qdiv.dev/eth2/recv-buffer.png" alt="receiver buffer"></p><p><code>U13</code>, <code>U16</code> and <code>U18</code> form an address multiplexer: it chooses either byte counter or system address bus as an address input for the SRAM (<code>U20</code>). A tri-state buffer <code>U21</code> forwards the received byte into the RAM.</p><p>To access the received data and its length, RAM and byte counter are connected to the system data bus with tri-state buffers:</p><p><img src="https://qdiv.dev/eth2/recv-output.png" alt="receiver output"></p><p><code>U25</code> connects the receiver RAM with the system data bus. After a frame is complete, the byte counter is not reset and its value is kept on the <code>recv_byte_cnt</code> bus. This bus is connected with the system data bus using <code>U26</code> and <code>U27</code>. They are activated when CPU makes a read request to specific addresses. The other half of <code>U27</code> makes a two-bit read-only status register which is used to query receiver and transmitter status.</p><h3 id="mac-address-filtering">MAC address filtering
<a href="#mac-address-filtering">#</a></h3><p>When analyzing the Ethernet traffic I noticed that frames usually come in small groups (3-4 frames together separated by a short delay). Frames in one group usually have different destination MAC addresses. This made me think that my computer won’t be able to filter received frames by MAC and re-arm the receiver fast enough to catch the frames meant for itself. I needed a hardware MAC address filtering.</p><p>Storing a custom MAC address somewhere and then comparing first 6 received bytes against it is a no-go: too complex. I could also make it a repetition of a single byte (e.g. FE:FE:FE:FE:FE:FE), but that’s boring. To bring some variation to my MAC, I made it a function of the byte index:</p><ul><li>Bit 0 is fixed to 0;</li><li>Bit 1 is fixed to 1;</li><li>Bits 2-4 are an inversion of the byte index;</li><li>Bits 5-7 are fixed to 1.</li></ul><p>Using this rule, the MAC address comes out to be <code>FE:FA:F6:F2:EE:EA</code>. We also need to accept the broadcast MAC <code>FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF</code> to work with ARP.</p><p><img src="https://qdiv.dev/eth2/mac-filter.png" alt="MAC filter"></p><p>On this schematics, bus <code>a[0..3]</code> is the lower 4 bits of the byte counter. Bus <code>d[0..7]</code> is the received byte. <code>U33</code> compares data bits 0 and 2-4 with their desired values, the output of <code>U34A</code> will be high when those bits match. <code>U35A</code> implements the broadcast MAC check: its output will be high when bits 0 and 2-4 are all ones. Those two signals are combined with a logical OR (implemented with diodes <code>D7</code> and resistor <code>R6</code>). The remaining bits are checked for being all ones with <code>U35B</code>.</p><p>This block only checks the validity of a single byte. To check all six of them, the result is accumulated in <code>U10A</code>. When no frame is being received, <code>ss</code> (the incoming SPI slave select signal) is low and <code>U10A</code> is set to 1. During frame reception this value is updated for each received byte. If destination MAC address matches the criteria, the value of <code>U10A</code> stays high. When byte address reaches 5, the final value is latched into <code>U36B</code>. Its output is used to inhibit frame reception if destination address is unmatched.</p><h2 id="transmitter">Transmitter
<a href="#transmitter">#</a></h2><p>Similarly to the receiver, the transmitter doesn’t implement FCS generation, it is done in software. To simplify the transmitter even further, I decided to only support frames of a fixed length. This way no complex digital comparator is necessary, the frame transmission logic only depends on a single bit of the byte counter. I selected the frame length to be 1024 bytes, this is close to the usual MTU of 1500 bytes. The frame preamble (the sequence of several 0x55 ending with a 0xD5 required by 10BASE-T) is also included in those 1024 bytes and needs to be loaded there in software.</p><p>Fixing the frame length doesn’t have any effect on higher-level protocols because they encode the packet size in their headers and do not rely on the actual Ethernet frame length.</p><p>Summary of transmitter operation:</p><ul><li>Data is stored in a static RAM;</li><li>20 MHz clock is fed to a 4-bit counter, its overflow output is used as a byte clock;</li><li>To transmit a frame, user writes to a specific write-only memory location which enables the counter;</li><li>Parallel byte data is serialized using a shift register.</li></ul><h3 id="counters">Counters
<a href="#counters">#</a></h3><p><img src="https://qdiv.dev/eth2/tx-counters.png" alt="tx counters"></p><p>Same as in the receiver, two counters are used to count bits (<code>U12</code>) and bytes (<code>U14</code>). First counter is fed by a 20 MHz clock from an integrated oscillator. 20 MHz is not used directly, but only divided at least by 2. This way the duty cycle of the oscillator doesn’t affect the output signal.</p><h3 id="data-flow">Data flow
<a href="#data-flow">#</a></h3><p><img src="https://qdiv.dev/eth2/tx-dataflow.png" alt="tx data flow"></p><p>Same as in the receiver three 74HC157 multiplexors (not shown here) are used to select address input for the RAM (<code>U22</code>). <code>U23</code> is used to load data into the RAM. <code>U24</code> acts as an intermediate storage for the byte currently being transmitted. The idea here is similar to my <a href="https://qdiv.dev/posts/vga/#image-generation">VGA pipeline</a>: byte counter 74HC4040 is a ripple counter and is slow to stabilize, <code>U24</code> provides a stable output while RAM output is still invalid. This data is fed to the shift register <code>U28</code> and shifted bit-by-bit.</p><p><em>After I’d built the thing I noticed that I’d messed up the order of bits coming from the RAM to the shift register. I had to shuffle bits in software to workaround this hardware bug. This was something I couldn’t test in Verilog beforehand.</em></p><p>To form a nice 10BASE-T signal (see <a href="https://qdiv.dev/posts/eth-to-spi/#transmitter">my previous post</a>) <code>MOSI</code> and <code>SCK</code> should be precisely synchronized. <code>U11A</code> and <code>U8B</code> achieve that. <code>tx_cnt0</code> (bit 0 of the bit counter, 20 MHz divided by 2) is used as a clock. <code>U11A</code> changes its output in sync with this signal. <code>U8B</code> delays the clock to match the delay introduced by <code>U11A</code>. Because a D-latch is more complex than a simple AND gate and has a slightly larger (by 5 ns) delay, a faster 74LV74A is used here. Its propagation delay is the same as of 74HC08. This is the only chip of a “fast” family on this board.</p><h2 id="cpu-interface">CPU interface
<a href="#cpu-interface">#</a></h2><p>From the programmer’s point of view, my Ethernet adapter has following interface:</p><ul><li>Both frame buffers are mapped at <code>0xF000</code>.</li><li>There are two read-only registers:<ul><li>8-bit status register at <code>0xFB00</code> has two flags:<ul><li><code>RX_FULL</code> - a frame is received,</li><li><code>TX_BUSY</code> - a frame is being transmitted;</li></ul></li><li>16-bit received data length register at <code>0xFB02</code>.</li></ul></li><li>Writing any value at <code>0xFB00</code> re-arms the receiver.</li><li>Writing any value at <code>0xFB01</code> starts a transmission.</li></ul><p>There are no interrupts since my CPU doesn’t support them.</p><p><img src="https://qdiv.dev/eth2/addr-select.png" alt="address selector"></p><p>Any relevant address starts with an <code>F</code> (upper 4 bits are all ones). This condition is checked by <code>U2A</code>.</p><p>Bit 11 should be 0 for a buffer address. <code>U1D</code>, <code>D2</code>, <code>R2</code> and <code>U1E</code> check that. Then the buffer select signal is combined with either write- or output-enable signals to select writing to the TX buffer or reading from the RX buffer.</p><p>Second hex digit being <code>B</code> (1011) for registers is checked by <code>U1B</code> and <code>U2B</code>. Then another diode logic block (<code>D1</code>, <code>R1</code>, <code>U1C</code>) combines it with the first digit check. Decoders <code>U4A</code> and <code>U4B</code> are used to select the individual function.</p><p>Two LEDs indicate buffer or register access.</p><h2 id="programming">Programming
<a href="#programming">#</a></h2><p>I wanted a network support for my computer, but didn’t want to implement a TCP/IP stack myself. Also I wanted a decent C compiler because my first compiler sucked and programming in assembly is annoying. So I made a <a href="https://github.com/imihajlow/ccpu-cc">C compiler</a>. It is mature enough to compile uIP 1.0 (a tiny TCP/IP library). Despite my CPU having awfully low code density, uIP is small enough to fit into RAM and have some place left for an actual application.</p><p>Network performance is very low, but I’m still very happy with it considering that no commercial CPUs or special chips are involved here:</p><ul><li>Ping round trip average 85 ms;</li><li>HTTP server download speed 2.6 kB/s (serving static files from the SD card).</li></ul><h2 id="project-repository">Project repository

<p><em>Those of you who haven’t been in IT for far, far too long might not know that next month will be the 16th(!) anniversary of the <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/DSA-1571-1">disclosure</a> of what was, at the time, a fairly earth-shattering revelation: that for about 18 months, the Debian OpenSSL package was <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-0166">generating entirely predictable private keys</a>.</em></p>

<p>The recent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XZ_Utils_backdoor">xz-stential threat</a> (thanks to <a href="https://infosec.exchange/@nixCraft@mastodon.social">@nixCraft</a> for <a href="https://mastodon.social/@nixCraft/112219225728684695">making me aware of that one</a>), has got me thinking about my own serendipitous interaction with a major vulnerability.
Given that the statute of limitations has (probably) run out, I thought I’d share it as a tale of how “huh, that’s weird” can be a powerful threat-hunting tool – but only if you’ve got the time to keep pulling at the thread.</p>

<h2 id="prelude-to-an-adventure">Prelude to an Adventure</h2>

<p>Our story begins back in March 2008.
I was working at Engine Yard (EY), a now largely-forgotten Rails-focused hosting company, which pioneered several advances in Rails application deployment.
Probably EY’s greatest claim to lasting fame is that they helped launch a little code hosting platform you might have heard of, by providing them free infrastructure when they were little more than a glimmer in the Internet’s eye.</p>

<p>I am, of course, talking about everyone’s favourite Microsoft product: GitHub.</p>

<p>Since GitHub was in the right place, at the right time, with a compelling product offering, they quickly started to gain traction, and grow their userbase.
With growth comes challenges, amongst them the one we’re focusing on today: SSH login times.
Then, as now, GitHub provided SSH access to the git repos they hosted, by SSHing to <code>git@github.com</code> with publickey authentication.
They were using the standard way that everyone manages SSH keys: the <code>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code> file, and that became a problem as the number of keys started to grow.</p>

<p>The way that SSH uses this file is that, when a user connects and asks for publickey authentication, SSH opens the <code>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code> file and scans all of the keys listed in it, looking for a key which matches the key that the user presented.
This linear search is normally not a huge problem, because nobody in their right mind puts more than a few keys in their <code>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code>, right?</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://www.hezmatt.org/~mpalmer/blog/images/2008_github_auth_keys_sideeye.jpg" alt="2008-era GitHub giving monkey puppet side-eye to the idea that nobody stores many keys in an authorized_keys file">
</figure>

<p>Of course, as a popular, rapidly-growing service, GitHub was gaining users at a fair clip, to the point that the one big file that stored all the SSH keys was starting to visibly impact SSH login times.
This problem was also not going to get any better by itself.
Something Had To Be Done.</p>

<p>EY management was keen on making sure GitHub ran well, and so despite it not <em>really</em> being a hosting problem, they were willing to help fix this problem.
For some reason, the late, great, Ezra Zygmuntowitz pointed GitHub in my direction, and let me take the time to <em>really</em> get into the problem with the GitHub team.
After examining a variety of different possible solutions, we came to the conclusion that the least-worst option was to patch OpenSSH to lookup keys in a MySQL database, indexed on the key fingerprint.</p>

<p>We didn’t take this decision on a whim – it wasn’t a case of “yeah, sure, let’s just hack around with OpenSSH, what could possibly go wrong?”.
We knew it was potentially catastrophic if things went sideways, so you can imagine how much worse the other options available were.
Ensuring that this wouldn’t compromise security was a lot of the effort that went into the change.
In the end, though, we rolled it out in early April, and lo! SSH logins were fast, and we were pretty sure we wouldn’t have to worry about this problem for a long time to come.</p>

<p>Normally, you’d think “patching OpenSSH to make mass SSH logins super fast” would be a good story on its own.
But no, this is just the opening scene.</p>

<h2 id="chekovs-gun-makes-its-appearance">Chekov’s Gun Makes its Appearance</h2>

<p>Fast forward a little under a month, to the first few days of May 2008.
I get a message from one of the GitHub team, saying that <em>somehow</em> users were able to access other users’ repos over SSH.
Naturally, as we’d recently rolled out the OpenSSH patch, which touched <em>this very thing</em>, the code I’d written was suspect number one, so I was called in to help.</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://www.hezmatt.org/~mpalmer/blog/images/the_usual_suspects.png" alt="The lineup scene from the movie The Usual Suspects">
<figcaption>
  They're called The Usual Suspects for a reason, but sometimes, it really <b>is</b> Keyser Söze
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Eventually, after more than a little debugging, we discovered that, somehow, there were two users with keys that had the same key fingerprint.
This <em>absolutely</em> shouldn’t happen – it’s a bit like winning the lottery twice in a row<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="https://www.hezmatt.org/~mpalmer/blog/#fn:1">1</a></sup> – unless the users had somehow shared their keys with each other, of course.
Still, it was worth investigating, just in case it was a web application bug, so the GitHub team reached out to the users impacted, to try and figure out what was going on.</p>

<p>The users professed no knowledge of each other, neither admitted to publicising their key, and couldn’t offer any explanation as to how the other person could possibly have gotten their key.</p>

<p>Then things went from “weird” to “what the…?”.
Because <em>another</em> pair of users showed up, sharing a key fingerprint – but it was a <em>different</em> shared key fingerprint.
The odds now have gone from “winning the lottery multiple times in a row” to as close to “this literally cannot happen” as makes no difference.</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://www.hezmatt.org/~mpalmer/blog/images/were_through_the_looking_glass.jpg" alt="Milhouse from The Simpsons says that We're Through The Looking Glass Here, People">
</figure>

<p>Once we were really, <em>really</em> confident that the OpenSSH patch wasn’t the cause of the problem, my involvement in the problem basically ended.
I wasn’t a GitHub employee, and EY had plenty of other customers who needed my help, so I wasn’t able to stay deeply involved in the on-going investigation of The Mystery of the Duplicate Keys.</p>

<p>However, the GitHub team did keep talking to the users involved, and managed to determine the only apparent common factor was that all the users claimed to be using Debian or Ubuntu systems, which was where their SSH keys would have been generated.</p>

<p>That was as far as the investigation had really goten, when along came May 13, 2008.</p>

<h2 id="chekovs-gun-goes-off">Chekov’s Gun Goes Off</h2>

<p>With the publication of <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/DSA-1571-1">DSA-1571-1</a>, everything suddenly became clear.
Through a well-meaning but ultimately disasterous cleanup of OpenSSL’s randomness generation code, the Debian maintainer had inadvertently reduced the number of possible keys that could be generated by a given user from “bazillions” to a little over 32,000.
With so many people signing up to GitHub – some of them no doubt following best practice and freshly generating a separate key – it’s unsurprising that some collisions occurred.</p>

<p>You can imagine the sense of “oooooooh, so <em>that’s</em> what’s going on!” that rippled out once the issue was understood.
I was mostly glad that we had conclusive evidence that my OpenSSH patch wasn’t at fault, little knowing how much more contact I was to have with Debian weak keys in the future, running <a href="https://pwnedkeys.com/">a huge store of known-compromised keys</a> and using them to find <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1620772">misbehaving Certificate Authorities</a>, amongst other things.</p>

<h2 id="lessons-learned">Lessons Learned</h2>

<p>While I’ve not found a description of exactly when and how Luciano Bello discovered the vulnerability that became CVE-2008-0166, I presume he first came across it some time before it was disclosed – likely before GitHub tripped over it.
The stable Debian release that included the vulnerable code had been released a year earlier, so there was plenty of time for Luciano to have discovered key collisions and go “hmm, I wonder what’s going on here?”, then keep digging until the solution presented itself.</p>

<p>The thought “hmm, that’s odd”, followed by intense investigation, leading to the discovery of a major flaw is also what ultimately brought down the recent XZ backdoor.
The critical part of that sequence is the ability to <em>do</em> that intense investigation, though.</p>

<p>When I reflect on my brush with the Debian weak keys vulnerability, what sticks out to me is the fact that I <em>didn’t</em> do the deep investigation.
I wonder if Luciano hadn’t found it, how long it might have been before it was found.
The GitHub team would have continued investigating, presumably, and perhaps they (or I) would have eventually dug deep enough to find it.
But we were all super busy – myself, working support tickets at EY, and GitHub feverishly building features and fighting the fires in their rapidly-growing service.</p>

<p>As it was, Luciano <em>was</em> able to take the time to dig in and find out what was happening, but just like the XZ backdoor, I feel like we, as an industry, got a bit lucky that someone with the skills, time, and energy was on hand at the right time to make a huge difference.</p>

<p>It’s a luxury to be able to take the time to really dig into a problem, and it’s a luxury that most of us rarely have.
Perhaps an understated takeaway is that somehow we all need to wrestle back some time to follow our hunches and really dig into the things that make us go “hmm…”.</p>

<hr>
<p>OAKLAND, Calif. — Bay Area Rapid Transit, the 131-mile electrified rail network in the San Francisco Bay Area, is offering the public a last chance to ride the 1970s-era futuristic railcars that made up its original fleet.</p>
<p>On Saturday, April 20, at 1 p.m. at the MacArthur station in Oakland, BART will commemorate the cars with a ceremony and then run two 10-car trains using original cars for the last time. Anyone can ride for the usual fare.</p>
<p>“We understand that BART cars are iconic, especially the sloped-front A cars,” said BART spokesperson Jim Allison. “We just wanted to give them a proper sendoff so that people had a chance to say goodbye to the cars that have been serving the Bay Area for more than 50 years.”</p>
<p>The special trains will run about 24 miles from MacArthur to Fremont, the first segment of BART to open 52 years ago. The trains will make the usual stops and run more loops between the two stations if needed to accommodate everyone who wants to ride, he said.</p>
<p>The “Riding into History: Final Run of the First Fleet” event will include speeches, a raffle for a couple of railcar plates, and probably some merchandise for sale, Allison said. Some details were still being decided early this month.</p>
<p>April 20 is coincidentally the same day when the electric trains of the Key System, a BART predecessor, ran their final miles in 1958.</p>
<p>The legacy fleet ended regular service in September 2023; when that date was set, BART had indicated it would eventually hold a special farewell event [see <a href="https://www.trains.com/trn/news-reviews/news-wire/bart-to-retire-last-original-cars-on-sept-11/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“BART to retire last original cars …,”</a> Trains News Wire, Aug. 25, 2023]. Most of the legacy equipment has already been recycled, but BART is donating three cars — one each of the A, B and C versions — to the Western Railway Museum at Rio Vista Junction, which is run by the Bay Area Electric Railroad Association. Five other cars were awarded in 2022 for reuse ranging from an arcade area at an Oakland bar and grill to use in firefighter training [see “<a href="https://www.trains.com/trn/news-reviews/news-wire/bart-to-award-eight-retired-cars-for-reuse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BART to award eight retired cars ..,”</a> News Wire, March 16, 2022].</p>
<p>When it opened on Sept. 11, 1972, BART was the first entirely new rail transit system built in the United States in decades, built to an atypical 5-foot, 6-inch gauge for reasons <a href="https://www.bart.gov/news/articles/2022/news20220708-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the agency explains here</a>. Its technology, advanced for the time, included central computer control, on-board electronic propulsion and “the lightest weight car per passenger ever built,” the museum says. The intended effect was space age, not subway.</p>
<p>Museum volunteers will ride the last trains, staff a table, and speak for a few minutes at the farewell, said Andy Payne, a museum archivist and author of “Legacy Fleet,” an upcoming book about the cars.</p>
<p>The museum will receive the cars in June and intends to place them in its Loring C. Jensen Memorial Car House 3. “We are planning exhibits near the cars showcasing the history of the BART system and the legacy fleet,” he said. “In the future, if funding allows, we would love to build the <a href="https://www.wrm.org/fundraising-campaigns/rapid-transit-history-center" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rapid Transit History Center</a>” that would feature the cars and other aspects of Bay Area electric rail history.</p>
<p>The museum runs historic equipment from several electric railroads on about 6 miles of ex-Sacramento Northern track with overhead wire, but can’t operate the BART cars, because of their gauge and need for third-rail power.</p>
<p>According to BART, the 669 cars in the legacy fleet used 1,000-volt DC electricity for propulsion, with one 150 hp motor per axle and four motors per car. The fleet had:</p>
<ul>
<li>59 A2 cars and 380 B2 cars, built by aerospace company Rohr Industries. They began service in 1972, and were rehabilitated in 1997 and 2002.</li>
<li>150 C1 cars from Alstom. They entered service in 1988, and were never rehabilitated.</li>
<li>80 C2 cars from Morrison-Knudsen. They began service in 1994, and were never rehabilitated.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each car was 70 feet long, except for the A model, 75 feet with a cab.</p>
<p>BART’s new <a href="https://www.bart.gov/about/projects/cars" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fleet of the Future</a> consists of 775 cars from Bombardier, later bought by Alstom. Also 70 feet long, each car uses 1,000-volt DC electricity, gets power from a third rail, and has two trucks with one 194-hp motor per axle, and two axles per truck.</p>

<p>
TSAC is an audio compression utility reaching very low bitrates such
as 5.5 kb/s for mono or 7.5 kb/s for stereo at 44.1 kHz with a good
perceptual quality. Hence TSAC compresses a 3.5 minute stereo song to
a file of 192 KiB.
</p>
<p>
An Nvidia GPU is necessary for fast operation. CPU only is also
supported but slower.

<h2>Technical information</h2>
<ul>
  <li><code>tsac</code> is based on a modified version of
    the <a href="https://github.com/descriptinc/descript-audio-codec">Descript
      Audio Codec</a> extended for stereo and a Transformer model to further
    increase the compression ratio. Both models are quantized to 8 bits
    per parameter.</li>
  <li>The Transformer model is evaluated in a deterministic and
    reproducible way. Hence the result does not depend on the exact
    GPU or CPU model nor on the number of configured threads. This key
    point ensures that a compressed file can be decompressed using a
    different hardware or software configuration.</li>
</ul>
