          <p data-word-count="62" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cls3r1e21000hpam3f90hzlx3@published">“<a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2015/05/ticketmaster-why-do-so-many-music-venues-use-it-when-everyone-hates-it.html">Why Do So Many Music Venues Use Ticketmaster?</a>” “<a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2015/06/whats-it-like-to-train-to-be-a-sushi-chef.html">What’s It Like to Train to Be a Sushi Chef?</a>” “<a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2015/03/how-do-martial-artists-break-concrete-blocks.html">How Do Martial Artists Break Concrete Blocks?</a>” If you were looking for answers to such questions 10 years ago, your best resource for finding a thorough, expert-informed response likely would have been one of the most interesting and longest-lasting corners of the internet: Quora.</p>

  <p data-word-count="115" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cls3re69m001f3b6ytxcd9hx2@published">Most people have encountered Quora in some form, whether they know it or not: in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quora#/media/File:Google_Search_popularity_of_Quora.png">Google search results</a>, in writing samples <a href="https://twitter.com/PtakTestKitchen/status/1723809343076696275">from famous authors</a>, or perhaps in reprints of certain Q&amp;As in digital publications, <a href="https://slate.com/author/quora-contributor">like Slate</a>. One of those <a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2013/04/can-you-have-a-rational-opinion-against-gay-marriage-and-not-be-homophobic.html">Slate-via-Quora contributors</a>, author and researcher <a href="http://quora.com/profile/Erica-Friedman">Erica Friedman</a>, joined the site back in 2011, when it was “starting to get a little bit of new traffic” thanks in part to <a href="https://searchengineland.com/yahoo-answers-hits-300-million-questions-but-qa-activity-is-declining-127314">Yahoo Answers’ decline</a> in reliability and activity. This, she said, allowed Quora to stand out as an accuracy-focused, knowledge-centric text platform. That was a unique offering in an age when Facebook and Twitter were coming to dominate the social internet, and <a href="https://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/6787/5517">YouTube was doing</a> its own thing.</p>

  

  <p data-word-count="124" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cls3re6bf001g3b6yqyneatsa@published">Friedman was so enamored of the quirky Q&amp;A monolith that she—and many, many others—contributed answers for free. “There was a period of time, for a number of years in the mid-2010s, that a lot of us were really dedicated to a particular mission,” she said. “That was: ‘Let’s make Quora the place on the internet that says you can’t be a jerk here. Let’s put those policies into action, and let’s make it impossible for people to come here in bad faith and act in bad faith.’ ” A smart and passionate community dedicated to maintaining a positive and affirmative space where the most curious netizens could gather—what sounded more ideal than that? No wonder Quora had such a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/21/uniquorn/">growth spurt in the 2010s</a>.</p>

  


  


  


  


  <p data-word-count="154" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cls3re6d9001j3b6y1tikthmz@published">Today’s Quora, however, hardly meshes with those utopian aims. The once-beloved forum is now home to a never-ending avalanche of meaningless, repetitive sludge, filled with <a href="https://twitter.com/PoojaIsNagpal/status/1726045612901331196">bizarre</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Zeronelite/status/1743449094360596802">nonsensical</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/3DrakaiNa/status/1743993622737863056">straight-up hateful</a>, and A.I.–generated entries along with a slurry of <a href="https://www.quora.com/qemail/tc?al_imp=eyJ0eXBlIjogMzMsICJoYXNoIjogIjY1MTU3NDk0MjQ5NjgzMzA0NHwxMnwxfDE0Nzc3NDM3MDg2NTEyMDAifQ%3D%3D&amp;al_pri=1&amp;aoid=YMFq83qCG68&amp;aoty=2&amp;aty=4&amp;cp=12&amp;et=2&amp;id=be140b4cf1c147b8a77b16e99fa8ace0&amp;q_aid=8wxTj0iwhqF&amp;uid=VBcXXrgmmw2">all-caps non-questions</a> like “OMG! KING CHARLES SHOCK the WORLD with ROYAL BAN ON PRINCE HARRY AND MEGHAN MARKLE. SAD?” (The answer to this “question,” which garnered about <a href="https://hollywoodactress02.quora.com/OMG-KING-CHARLES-SHOCK-the-WORLD-with-ROYAL-BAN-ON-PRINCE-HARRY-AND-MEGHAN-MARKLE-SAD">7 million views</a>, links to a bizarre, barely functional royals-watching website called red-carpett.com.) Whereas once you could Google a question about current events and find links to thoughtful Quora answers near the top of the results, you’re now more likely to come upon, say, a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=donald+trump+racism+site%3Aquora.com&amp;sca_esv=602396836&amp;ei=0ue3ZZbuOb6bptQPpouDgA0&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiWn-roloOEAxW-jYkEHabFANAQ4dUDCBA&amp;uact=5&amp;oq=donald+trump+racism+site%3Aquora.com&amp;gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiImRvbmFsZCB0cnVtcCByYWNpc20gc2l0ZTpxdW9yYS5jb21IgwxQmQJYgAhwAXgAkAEAmAE4oAHTAqoBATe4AQPIAQD4AQHiAwQYASBBiAYB&amp;sclient=gws-wiz-serp#ip=1">bunch of folks</a> asking in the year of our Lord 2024 whether the <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2024/01/trump-debuts-new-racist-name-for-nikki-haley.html">consistently racist Donald Trump</a> is, in fact, racist. Or, maybe, the featured Google snippet will tell you that <a href="https://genius.com/Westside-gunn-margiela-split-toes-lyrics">eggs can melt</a>, thanks to a nonsense Quora answer caught in the search crawler.</p>

  


  

  


  <p data-word-count="59" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cls3re6f7001k3b6yv9lotim9@published">Quora’s still-strong SEO has only brought more attention to the issue. <a href="https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2024/1/27/2219870/-Boosting-Biden-on-Quora#comment_87913421">Commenters across</a> a <a href="https://sitejabber.com/reviews/quora.com">variety of forums</a> have <a href="https://reddit.com/r/quora/comments/17otfiw/why_does_every_question_on_quora_seem_from_bots/">bemoaned Quora’s downgrade</a> in quality, and the Atlantic recently asked, “<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/01/quora-tragedy-answer-websites/677062/">If There Are No Stupid Questions, Then How Do You Explain Quora?</a>” Just scroll through the “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/InsanePeopleQuora/comments/18oq0xi/this_ridiculous_question_was_asked_by_the_quora/">Insane People Quora</a>” subreddit if you’d like more examples of this pronounced decline in quality.</p>

  


  


  <p data-word-count="75" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cls3re6h7001l3b6yx6k4zkcu@published">Quora’s shrinking utility isn’t due entirely to A.I.: Longtime writers cite issues with moderation and functionality that started well before the ChatGPT era. But its decline has been accelerating—much to the chagrin of the uniquely attached and now-fraying community—with the rise of this new knowledge broker. Earlier this month, the A.I.–accelerationist venture capital hub <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2023/11/openai-sam-altman-ai-microsoft-eacc-effective-altruism.html">Andreessen Horowitz</a> blessed Quora with a much-needed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/09/quora-75m-funding-a16z-poe-ai-chat/">$75 million investment</a>—but <em>only</em> for the sake of developing its on-site generative-text chatbot, Poe.</p>

  
  <p data-word-count="151" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cls3re6kl001m3b6yqmewtg4l@published">The early advantage Quora had over the (many) other Q&amp;A sites in the late 2000s was that it was <em>designed</em> with social networking in mind. Co-founders Adam D’Angelo and Charlie Cheever were both early Facebook employees who quit in 2009 in order to build a website where, as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2010/03/28/quora-has-the-magic-benchmark-invests-at-86-million-valuation/">they told TechCrunch</a> at the time, “we’re trying to get information out of people’s heads, so it’s not on sources that are hard to access on the internet, and get it into a really useful format to make a valuable database.” Their plan was to persuade experts in specialized fields to share their insights with knowledge-seekers and, from there, build a vibrant community around this free exchange of authentic information. “There were a lot of high-quality answers from people who wanted to just share their experiences,” said Friedman—a feature that stood in stark contrast with Yahoo Answers, which “never built up that community.”</p>

  


  


  


  <p data-word-count="69" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cls3re6ky001n3b6y0efypg19@published">Ariel Williams, one of Quora’s <a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/Ariel-Williams">first 500,000 members</a>, agreed. “You had Yahoo Answers, and the quality was horrible: People would write a question and somebody would just say something disgusting,” she told me. “Quora had a focus on quality, and they were looking for quality answers, they were looking for quality questions, there was active moderation, and the whole site was set up around the people, around the users.”</p>

  


  <p data-word-count="71" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cls3re6n2001o3b6yntpskce1@published">It didn’t take long for experts like <a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/Stan-Hanks">Stan Hanks</a>, best known as a <a href="https://rule11.tech/history-of-networking-stan-hanks-and-gre/">pioneering network engineer</a> who <a href="https://www.quora.com/Who-invented-virtual-private-networks-VPN">built the first</a> IP virtual private networks, to show up. In late 2012, he told me, he would log on to Quora, and “there would be something where I had personal experience where I knew the people involved, where I had backstories, and it would just light me up, and I would just write.”</p>

  


  <p data-word-count="96" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cls3re6oz001p3b6y2weychts@published">To keep the volunteer experts happy, Quora built out its perks. The company established a Top Writer program for Quora’s best and most fervent answer-writers, built a system that incentivized thoughtful discussion, and even invited these happy Quorans the opportunity to hang out at summits held at company headquarters. “The Top Writer program spanned from 2012 to 2018,” said Williams, herself a Top Writer in an elite crew of just a few hundred Quorans. “There was a physicist that had worked with Freeman Dyson. There were people that worked at NASA. There were people with doctorates.”</p>

  


  <p data-word-count="73" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cls3re6qs001q3b6yc6f23g28@published">There was also robust human backup for all these writers. “There was a moderation team, a review team, and a support team,” said Hanks. “Full-time paid moderators were employees of Quora, and part-time moderators had other jobs like writer engagement.” There were paid community managers who enforced a basic standard of BNBR (“Be Nice, Be Respectful”), customer service support staff, and a department for cross-publishing particular Q&amp;As to websites like Forbes and HuffPost.</p>

  


  <p data-word-count="55" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cls3re6sk001r3b6yumiume2u@published">The social network racked up hundreds of millions of page views, raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/04/09/quora-forever/">millions of dollars</a> from cash-happy investors, and carved out a corner of the internet distinct from Wikipedia, Reddit, or Facebook. It may not have had the ubiquity and fame of those sites, but that was fine—everyone touching Quora knew what it stood for.</p>

  


  <p data-word-count="125" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cls3re6vl001s3b6yb6ovsx9b@published">But even then, there were issues plaguing Quora that would continue to fester. First, an anonymous former Quoran told me, the site started “shortening the length of questions.” The professed reason was to increase Quora’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/c/23998379/google-search-seo-algorithm-webpage-optimization">visibility on Google</a>, but that brevity came with a cost: It also made it difficult for users to ask the types of complex questions that could be addressed by specialists, including extremely specific <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-much-equity-should-I-get-as-a-co-founder-to-build-a-startup-from-scratch-I%E2%80%99ve-been-offered-10-subject-to-dilution-with-a-typical-CTO-salary-The-company-hasn%E2%80%99t-started-yet-they-don%E2%80%99t-have-a-prototype-10-for-a-CTO-is-very-low-What-is-fair">business-related queries</a> of the type Hanks would answer. (For example: “How much equity should I get as a co-founder to build a startup from scratch? I’ve been offered 10%, subject to dilution, with a typical CTO salary. The company hasn’t started yet, they don’t have a prototype. 10% for a CTO is very low. What is fair?”)</p>

  <p data-word-count="85" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cls3re6xd001t3b6y0tomcaax@published">Then there was what <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/how-did-your-son-tell-you_b_12376218">former Top Writer J. Starr</a> (who has since <a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/User-9909878588354538212">deleted her account</a>) characterized to me as “optimizing the feed.” At first, when a user signed in to Quora, they saw what they had come there to see: questions to be answered. But soon, the site started “putting ‘content’ articles into everyone’s feed,” flooding the site with articles that were, according to Starr, “just dreck, gossipy-rag articles about Hollywood figures.” A grim precursor, it seems, to the current-day all-caps PSAs around King Charles.</p>

  


  


  <p data-word-count="90" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cls3re6z9001u3b6y83lx3drt@published">There were early problems with ads and bots too. When Quora started putting ads on the site in 2016, Williams and other Top Writers suggested that there be some sort of creator revenue-sharing program, she told me. As a result, higher-ups created “the <a href="https://quorapartners.quora.com/">Quora partner program</a>, which I joined myself,” Williams said. But that “was all about trying to come up with questions that would draw in more views and more people,” she said—not about incentivizing high-quality answers. It was all about adding webpages of individual questions, for SEO purposes.</p>

  


  <p data-word-count="79" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cls3re70z001v3b6y57cgscfe@published">And Quora “partners” weren’t the only ones being recruited to this task—the site also attracted bots that would pull questions from Reddit threads onto Quora pages. They weren’t the type of questions the Quora community was looking for. “You would have people creating bots with templates of ‘What are the best places to eat at,’ and then it would put in city names, state, country names,” Williams said. (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/quora/comments/gb495s/bots_asking_the_questions/">Redditors on r/Quora</a> began to notice and complain about this practice.)</p>

  


  <p data-word-count="82" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cls3re736001w3b6y7slbzmw4@published">“The quality of the writing had taken a back seat to a pure volume of traffic,” said <a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/Bethann-Siviter">Bethann Siviter</a>, another former Top Writer. “With the partner program, it became clear that quantity meant more than quality. You could report people over and over, and nothing happened.” Even though the partner program <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/the-hard-truth-about-the-new-quora-partner-program-5e3229ae83c5">didn’t earn participants</a> all that much money (maybe a few thousand dollars at most), the people who made bots soon learned that this was the easiest way to cash in quickly.</p>

  <p data-word-count="131" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cls3re754001x3b6y8hy1lv83@published">This was all downstream of the fact that Quora was also slow to monetize, and it didn’t help that the site, popular as it was, was aiming for pieces of the same digital-advertising pie that <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/01/journalists-facebook-google-advertising-monopoly-attack-destroy.html">was rapidly overtaken</a> by Facebook and Amazon (as well as its No. 1 traffic referrer, Google). Investors hesitated to <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/5/16/18627157/quora-value-billion-question-answer">continue pouring cash</a> into Quora in light of its steep expenses. So, the company slashed budgets, shrinking the moderation teams, the customer support apparatus, and the Top Writer initiative. Other originating features—the requirement that Quorans use their real names, “<a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-did-Quora-remove-the-suggest-edit-to-an-answer-function-as-of-February-2021">Suggested Edits</a>” that readers could propose for answers that had mistakes or typos—were also cut. All these choices led to more unchecked spam and a <a href="https://communismisracistandacancertowethepeople.quora.com/?q=Democrats%20are%20a%20cancer">deluge of trolls</a>, which volunteer users could not hold off on their own.</p>

  


  


  


  


  
  <p data-word-count="94" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cls3re76y001y3b6ydb8ixg26@published"><a href="https://4horsemenpublications.com/our-authors/nelson-mckeeby/">Nelson McKeeby</a>, an author who joined Quora in 2013, said that things got worse in a post-Gamergate internet, with alt-right, Trump-loving trolls invading online forums, aided by anonymity and weakened moderation. “When real users tried to take down demonstrably false answers, troll farms with multiple servers were able to overpower users,” he wrote to me in an email. Further, as Quora launched “Spaces”—basically, private user–run community blogs—problems with moderation continued to spiral, with <a href="https://itsoktobewhite.quora.com/">ugly ideologies running rampant</a>. Loyal Quora users attempted to report <a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/Robert-Hafetz/You-cant-transition-that-impossible-youre-a-cross-dresser-passing-as-female-with-a-5-Oclock-shadow-and-dick-https-w">bigoted</a>, <a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-does-it-matter-if-I-see-myself-as-a-woman-and-live-as-a-women-using-hormones-and-surgery-Does-it-affect-you-as-I-am-a-transgender-woman/answer/Robert-Hafetz">transphobic</a>, and <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-does-it-feel-like-to-be-knotted">obscene</a> content without adequate support from the company.</p>

  <p data-word-count="101" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cls3re78x001z3b6ynm8kezc3@published">And then came A.I. As the spamming bots got even worse, Quora changed the terms of service and did away with BNBR, then automated the moderation process. Needless to say, it did not improve the situation on the site. Nor did the integrated A.I. chatbots offer good questions or answers. Instead, they “made up some really generic, and oftentimes first-grade-level questions,” wrote user <a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/Steven-P-Robinson">Steven P. Robinson</a> in an email. “It is a good example of A.I. not being ready for prime time.” Now Quora is even offering A.I.–generated images to accompany users’ answers, even though the spanwed illustrations make little sense.</p>

  <p data-word-count="186" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cls3re7ay00203b6yk7zul4s4@published">To top it all off, after Quora began using A.I. to “<a href="https://help.quora.com/hc/en-us/articles/15204996933780">generate machine answers</a> on a number of selected question pages,” the site made clear the possibility that human-crafted answers could be used for training A.I. This meant that the detailed writing Quorans provided mostly for free would be ingested into a custom large language model. Updated terms of service and privacy policies went into effect at the site last summer. As angel investor and Quoran <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-dirtiest-fine-print-youve-seen-in-a-contract/answer/David-S-Rose">David S. Rose paraphrased</a> them: “You grant all other Quora users the unlimited right to reuse and adapt your answers,” “You grant Quora the right to use your answers to train an LLM unless you specifically opt out,” and “You completely give up your right to be any part of any class action suit brought against Quora,” among others. (Quora’s <a href="https://help.quora.com/hc/en-us/articles/15205064557844-Can-I-opt-out-of-having-my-Quora-content-used-to-train-LLMs-">Help Center claims</a> that “as of now, we do not use answers, posts, or comments added to Quora to train LLMs used for generating content on Quora. However, this may change in the future.” The site offers an opt-out setting, although it admits that “opting out does not cover everything.”)</p>

  


  


  

  <p data-word-count="118" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cls3re7d300213b6ythekz333@published">This raised the issue of consent and ownership, as Quorans had to decide whether to consent to the new terms or <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/quora/comments/12p8vbl/are_people_still_using_quora/">take their work and flee.</a> High-profile users, like fantasy author Mercedes R. Lackey, are removing their work from their profiles and <a href="https://mercedesrlackeyspace.quora.com/Looks-like-I-m-going-to-be-leaving-Quora-gradually-over-the-next-several-weeks-or-months-as-I-slowly-work-my-way-through">writing notes explaining why</a>. “The A.I. thing, the terms of service issue, has been a massive drain of top talent on Quora, just based on how many people have said, <em>Downloaded my stuff and I’m out of there</em>,” Lackey told me. It’s not that all Quorans <em>want</em> to leave, but it’s hard for them to choose to remain on a website where they now have to constantly fight off errors, spam, trolls, and <a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/Stephanie-Martin-641/">even</a> <a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/Stephanie-Martin-639/activity">account</a> <a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/Stephanie-Martin-638">impersonators</a>.</p>

  

  <p data-word-count="80" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cls3re7er00223b6yf1gjgbj2@published">Quora is far from the only digital community to face an existential battle for its identity in the age of A.I.—<a href="https://slate.com/technology/2023/06/reddit-protests-steve-huffman-api-chaos.html">Reddit</a> and <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/01/18/why-is-google-search-so-bad-spam-links-seo-ai-algorithm/">Google</a> are facing related, if slightly distinct, concerns. The tragedy of Quora is not just that it crushed the flourishing communities it once built up. It’s that it took all of that goodwill, community, expertise, and curiosity and assumed that it could automate a system that equated it, apparently without much thought to how pale the comparison is.</p>

  <p data-word-count="38" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cls3re7gh00233b6yzrfzgx98@published">McKeeby has a grim prediction for the future: “Eventually Quora will be robot questions, robot answers, and nothing else.” I wonder how the site will answer the question of why Quora died, if anyone even bothers to <span>ask.</span></p>

<section><p>A new generation of observatories is enabling detailed study of exoplanetary atmospheres and the diversity of alien climates, allowing us to seek evidence for extraterrestrial biological and geological processes. Now is therefore the time to identify the most unique planets to be characterized with these instruments. In this context, we report on the discovery and validation of TOI-715 b, a <span>|$R_{\rm b}=1.55\pm 0.06\rm R_{\oplus }$|</span> planet orbiting its nearby (42 pc) M4 host (TOI-715/TIC 271971130) with a period <span>|$P_{\rm b} = 19.288004_{-0.000024}^{+0.000027}$|</span> d. TOI-715 b was first identified by <em>TESS</em> and validated using ground-based photometry, high-resolution imaging and statistical validation. The planet’s orbital period combined with the stellar effective temperature <span>|$T_{\rm eff}=3075\pm 75~\rm K$|</span> give this planet an installation <span>|$S_{\rm b} = 0.67_{-0.20}^{+0.15}~\rm S_\oplus$|⁠</span>, placing it within the most conservative definitions of the habitable zone for rocky planets. TOI-715 b’s radius falls exactly between two measured locations of the M-dwarf radius valley; characterizing its mass and composition will help understand the true nature of the radius valley for low-mass stars. We demonstrate TOI-715 b is amenable for characterization using precise radial velocities and transmission spectroscopy. Additionally, we reveal a second candidate planet in the system, TIC 271971130.02, with a potential orbital period of <span>|$P_{02} = 25.60712_{-0.00036}^{+0.00031}$|</span> d and a radius of <span>|$R_{02} = 1.066\pm 0.092\, \rm R_{\oplus }$|⁠</span>, just inside the outer boundary of the habitable zone, and near a 4:3 orbital period commensurability. Should this second planet be confirmed, it would represent the smallest habitable zone planet discovered by <em>TESS</em> to date.</p></section>                    
                    <h2 scrollto-destination="422951056" id="422951056" data-legacy-id="sec1">1 INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>At long last the era of <em>JWST</em> has arrived, and with it the age of detailed exoplanetary atmospheric characterization (The <em>JWST</em> Transiting Exoplanet Community Early Release Science Team <span id="jumplink-bib173"></span>2023). This achievement was unlocked just as the community hit another significant milestone: the discovery of the 5000th planet beyond the solar system.<sup><span id="jumplink-fn1"></span>1</sup> This ever-growing sample combined with the might of <em>JWST</em> is now set to deepen our understanding of planets, including those in our solar system, on a sub-population level.</p><p>One sub-population of particularly enduring interest consists of small, potentially habitable planets orbiting cool M-type stars. With current instrumentation, M dwarfs represent our best hope of finding temperate terrestrial planets, the best example being the seven Earth-sized planets of the TRAPPIST-1 system orbiting an M8V type star (Gillon et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib64"></span>2017). The reduced radii of M dwarfs enable small planets to produce large transit depths; this combined with the shorter orbital periods of these more compact systems makes photometric monitoring from ground and space-based facilities considerably more feasible (e.g. Nutzman&nbsp;&amp; Charbonneau <span id="jumplink-bib129"></span>2008; Reiners et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib143"></span>2018; Sebastian et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib156"></span>2021; Triaud <span id="jumplink-bib178"></span>2021). In the context of atmospheric characterization by transmission spectroscopy, bright, nearby M dwarfs are ideal planetary hosts as small temperate planets will transit frequently, enabling high signal-to-noise detections of atmospheric features with fewer hours of telescope time (Charbonneau&nbsp;&amp; Deming <span id="jumplink-bib22"></span>2007; Dressing&nbsp;&amp; Charbonneau <span id="jumplink-bib46"></span>2015; Morley et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib121"></span>2017). Additionally, these low mass stars appear more likely to host small planets from a theoretical and observational point of view (Montgomery&nbsp;&amp; Laughlin <span id="jumplink-bib120"></span>2009; Bonfils et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib13"></span>2013; Dressing&nbsp;&amp; Charbonneau <span id="jumplink-bib45"></span>2013; Mulders, Pascucci&nbsp;&amp; Apai <span id="jumplink-bib124"></span>2015; Alibert&nbsp;&amp; Benz <span id="jumplink-bib3"></span>2017; He, Triaud&nbsp;&amp; Gillon <span id="jumplink-bib73"></span>2017; Sabotta et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib149"></span>2021).</p><p>The so-called ‘habitable zone’ is a circumstellar region where an Earth-like planet could sustain liquid water on its surface (Kasting, Whitmire&nbsp;&amp; Reynolds <span id="jumplink-bib87"></span>1993). With sometimes contradictory definitions of its boundaries, which depend on stellar spectral type, planetary albedo, mass and even cloud cover (Underwood, Jones&nbsp;&amp; Sleep <span id="jumplink-bib182"></span>2003; Kopparapu et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib94"></span>2014; Ramirez&nbsp;&amp; Kaltenegger <span id="jumplink-bib141"></span>2016), it can be challenging to categorise planets using this metric. However, the most widely applicable and conservative definition comes from Kopparapu et&nbsp;al. (<span id="jumplink-bib93"></span>2013), stating that rocky planets receiving between <span>|$0.42\,\mathrm{ and}\,0.842\, S_{\oplus }$|</span> are in their star’s HZ, irrespective of all other factors.</p><p>The activity of the M-dwarf host stars themselves is an additional factor to consider in the habitability of planets orbiting M dwarfs, as the effect of their frequent flaring is not fully known (O’Malley-James&nbsp;&amp; Kaltenegger <span id="jumplink-bib130"></span>2017). Stellar flares could destroy a nascent atmosphere entirely (Davenport et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib36"></span>2016; Dong et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib41"></span>2017), or they might provide the energy needed to catalyse biological processes (Buccino, Lemarchand&nbsp;&amp; Mauas <span id="jumplink-bib18"></span>2007; Patel et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib136"></span>2015; Lingam&nbsp;&amp; Loeb <span id="jumplink-bib105"></span>2017; Rimmer et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib147"></span>2018). Additionally, we must look beyond our own terrestrial version of habitability, by exploring the possibility that biology might arise on water-worlds (Madhusudhan, Piette&nbsp;&amp; Constantinou <span id="jumplink-bib111"></span>2021) or temperate sub-Neptunes (Seager et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib155"></span>2021), as both of these may have different HZ boundaries.</p><p>We owe much of our current understanding of exoplanetary demographics to the <em>Kepler</em> mission (Borucki et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib15"></span>2010), and one of the most influential results to come out of statistical studies of the <em>Kepler</em> sample was the bimodal radius distribution of sub-Neptune sized planets, with a gap between <span>|$1.5\,\mathrm{ and}\,2\, R_{\oplus }$|</span> (Fulton et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib53"></span>2017; Van Eylen et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib184"></span>2018). The current best explanations for this bimodality are core-powered mass loss (Lopez&nbsp;&amp; Fortney <span id="jumplink-bib106"></span>2013; Ginzburg, Schlichting&nbsp;&amp; Sari <span id="jumplink-bib65"></span>2018; Gupta&nbsp;&amp; Schlichting <span id="jumplink-bib70"></span>2019), photo-evaporation (Owen&nbsp;&amp; Wu <span id="jumplink-bib133"></span>2013, <span id="jumplink-bib134"></span>2017) and volatile-poor formation (Lee, Chiang&nbsp;&amp; Ormel <span id="jumplink-bib97"></span>2014; Venturini&nbsp;&amp; Helled <span id="jumplink-bib186"></span>2017). While the exact location of this so-called ‘radius valley’ depends on stellar mass among other things (Wu <span id="jumplink-bib190"></span>2019; Gupta&nbsp;&amp; Schlichting <span id="jumplink-bib71"></span>2020), it is still unclear whether it is present around M dwarfs or not (Cloutier&nbsp;&amp; Menou <span id="jumplink-bib25"></span>2020). Therefore, planets with sizes within the radius valley (e.g. Cloutier et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib26"></span>2020, <span id="jumplink-bib27"></span>2021; Luque et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib109"></span>2022) help us to understand the shape and depth of this gap around M dwarfs. A recent study by Luque&nbsp;&amp; Pallé (<span id="jumplink-bib108"></span>2022), however, indicates that M-dwarf planets may have a density gap rather than a radius gap separating two populations of small planets (rocky and water worlds), and that these observations are also well explained by formation pathways that include disc-driven migration (Venturini et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib187"></span>2020).</p><p>At present <em>TESS</em> (Ricker et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib145"></span>2015) is providing the community with ample new planets to improve our understanding of exoplanetary demographics, including by populating the habitable zone. Notably, while several ‘habitable zone’ planets discovered by <em>TESS</em> have been confirmed (e.g. Gilbert et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib62"></span>2020; Vach et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib183"></span>2022), none yet have fallen within the conservative habitable zone as described by Kopparapu et&nbsp;al. (<span id="jumplink-bib93"></span>2013) – until now.</p><p>In this context, we report on the discovery of TOI-715 b, a small planet orbiting a nearby M4 star (TOI-715/TIC 271971130). The planet’s relatively long orbital period and cool host provide it with a mild installation, placing TOI-715 b comfortably within its star’s conservative habitable zone. We additionally find a second candidate in the system that, if confirmed, could be <em>TESS</em>’s smallest habitable zone planet discovered to date.</p><p>Our paper is organised as follows: we begin by characterizing the host star using its spectral energy distribution and reconnaissance spectroscopy in Section&nbsp;<span id="jumplink-sec2"></span><a href="#sec2">2</a>. We then describe the identification of planetary candidates in the data, first by <em>TESS</em> followed by our own search, in Section&nbsp;<span id="jumplink-sec3"></span><a href="#sec3">3</a>. In Section&nbsp;<span id="jumplink-sec4"></span><a href="#sec4">4</a>, we describe our ground-based follow-up campaign and our procedures to validate the system, and in Section&nbsp;<span id="jumplink-sec5"></span><a href="#sec5">5</a> we detail our global analysis of all available data. Finally, we contextualize our results in Section&nbsp;<span id="jumplink-sec6"></span><a href="#sec6">6</a> and conclude in Section&nbsp;<span id="jumplink-sec7"></span><a href="#sec7">7</a>.</p>                    <h2 scrollto-destination="422951065" id="422951065" data-legacy-id="sec2">2 STELLAR CHARACTERIZATION</h2>
<p>TOI-715 (TIC 271971130) is a nearby (<span>⁠|$\rm 42\, pc$|⁠</span>; Bailer-Jones et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib10"></span>2021) M dwarf of spectral type M4. It is a high-proper-motion target with right ascension 07:35:24.56 hms and declination −73:34:38.67 dms (J2000, epoch 2015.5), placing it within <em>TESS</em>’s continuous viewing zone (CVZ). As all our planetary information will be derived using the host star’s parameters, we begin in the section&nbsp;that follows by characterizing TOI-715.

<p>We collected an optical spectrum of TOI-715 on 2022 January 7 (<span>ut</span>) using the Low Dispersion Survey Spectrograph on the 6.5-m <em>Magellan</em><span>ii</span> (Clay) Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory in Chile. With its upgraded red-sensitive CCD (Stevenson et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib167"></span>2016), this instrument is now known as ‘LDSS-3C’. We used LDSS-3C in long-slit mode with the standard setup (fast readout speed, low gain, and 1&nbsp;×&nbsp;1 binning) and the VPH-Red grism, OG-590 blocking filter, and the 0<span>|${_{.}^{\prime\prime}}$|</span>75&nbsp;×&nbsp;0<span>|${_{.}^{\prime}}$|</span>4 center slit. This setup provides spectra covering 6000–10 000 Å with a resolution of <em>R</em> ∼ 1810, which is insufficient to produce a notable constraint on <em>v</em>sin <em>i</em><sub>⋆</sub>.</p><p>We observed TOI-715 during clear conditions with seeing of 0<span>|${_{.}^{\prime\prime}}$|</span>5. We collected six exposures of 300 s each, totaling 30 min on-source, at an average airmass of 1.445. Afterwards, we collected three 1-s exposures of the nearby F8 V standard star HR 2283 (Maiolino, Rieke&nbsp;&amp; Rieke <span id="jumplink-bib113"></span>1996) at an average airmass of 1.360. At each pointing, we collected a 1-s HeNeAr arc lamp exposure and three, 10-s flat fields with the ‘quartz high’ lamp. We reduced the data with a custom, <span>python</span>-based pipeline, which includes bias removal, flat field correction, and spectral extraction. For wavelength calibration, the HeNeAr arc exposure was used, which was extracted similarly to the science spectrum. For flux calibration, we used the ratio of the spectrum of the flux standard HR 2283 with an F8 V template from Pickles (<span id="jumplink-bib138"></span>1998) to compute a relative flux correction; no correction was made to address telluric absorption. The final science spectrum has a maximum SNR per resolution element of 193 at 9202 Å and a mean SNR per resolution element of 124 in the 6000–10 000 Å range.</p><p>The reduced spectrum (Fig. <span id="jumplink-fig1"></span>1) was analysed using <span>kastredux</span>.<sup><span id="jumplink-fn2"></span>2</sup> We compared the spectrum to Sloan Digital Sky Survey templates from Kesseli et&nbsp;al. (<span id="jumplink-bib89"></span>2017), finding a best match to an M4 dwarf. This classification was verified through spectral classification indices from Reid, Hawley&nbsp;&amp; Gizis (<span id="jumplink-bib142"></span>1995), Lépine, Rich&nbsp;&amp; Shara (<span id="jumplink-bib98"></span>2003), and Riddick, Roche&nbsp;&amp; Lucas (<span id="jumplink-bib146"></span>2007), all of which measure consistent spectral classifications of M4. We evaluated the ζ metallicity index (Lépine, Rich&nbsp;&amp; Shara <span id="jumplink-bib99"></span>2007; Lépine et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib100"></span>2013), determining a value of 1.066&nbsp;±&nbsp;0.002 which corresponds to a metallicity [Fe/H]&nbsp;=&nbsp;+0.09&nbsp;±&nbsp;0.20 dex based on the empirical calibration of Mann et&nbsp;al. (<span id="jumplink-bib114"></span>2013).

<p>The lack of detectable H α emission in its optical spectrum, and absence of any significant flaring activity in its <em>TESS</em> light curve, both suggest a relatively old age for TOI-715 given the persistent emission of most mid-type M dwarfs (Newton et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib127"></span>2017; Kiman et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib90"></span>2019). We estimated the age of TOI-715 by comparing its <em>UVW</em> velocities and metallicity to local stars with previously determined ages from isochrone fitting and metallicities from high resolution spectroscopy (cf. Burgasser&nbsp;&amp; Mamajek <span id="jumplink-bib21"></span>2017; Delrez et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib38"></span>2022). Our comparison sample was drawn from the GALAH Data Release 3 catalogue (Buder et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib19"></span>2021), for which ages are estimated using the Bayesian Stellar Parameter Estimation (<span>bstep</span>) code (Sharma et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib158"></span>2018). A matched GALAH sample was selected by requiring a distance ≤200&nbsp;pc, and agreement with TOI-715 in individual <em>UVW</em> velocities to within 10&nbsp;km s<sup>−1</sup> and metallicity to within 0.20 dex. The age distributions of the full GALAH sample and matched stars are shown in Fig. <span id="jumplink-fig3"></span>3.

The very low SNR of the signal makes it challenging to discern by eye whether or not the shape is consistent with that of a planetary transit. We also note that this signal is only found in four of the detrended light curves (with window sizes between 0.38–0.65&nbsp;d, but not the PDCSAP light curve, indicating that the signal could be dependent on detrending. The duration of a transit at this period on a circular orbit is should be of order 0.065&nbsp;d, and all tested windows are at least 3&nbsp;× this duration. We therefore do not believe the detrending will have suppressed the transit in other light curves if it is real.

<p>Close stellar companions (bound or in the line of sight) can confound derived exoplanet properties in a number of ways. The detected transit signal might be a false positive due to a background eclipsing binary and even real planet discoveries will yield incorrect stellar and exoplanet parameters if a close companion exists and is unaccounted for (e.g. Ciardi et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib24"></span>2015; Furlan&nbsp;&amp; Howell <span id="jumplink-bib54"></span>2017, <span id="jumplink-bib55"></span>2020). Additionally, the presence of a close companion star leads to the non-detection of small planets residing within the same exoplanetary system (Lester et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib101"></span>2021). Approximately 25 &nbsp;per cent of M dwarfs are part of binary or multiple star systems (e.g. Cortes Contreras et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib30"></span>2015; Winters et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib188"></span>2019), though fewer than 5 &nbsp;per cent of known spectroscopic binaries include an M-dwarf primary star (Pourbaix et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib139"></span>2004).<sup><span id="jumplink-fn10"></span>10</sup> None the less, high resolution imaging provides crucial information towards our understanding of exoplanetary formation, dynamics, and evolution (Howell et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib78"></span>2021).</p><p>TOI-715 was observed on 2020 December 26 <span>ut</span> using the Zorro speckle instrument on the Gemini South 8-m telescope (Scott et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib153"></span>2021). Zorro provides simultaneous speckle imaging in two bands (<span>⁠|$562~\rm nm$|</span> and <span>|$832~\rm nm$|⁠</span>) with output data products including a reconstructed image with robust contrast limits on companion detection (see Howell&nbsp;&amp; Furlan <span id="jumplink-bib76"></span>2022). TOI-715 was found to be a single star to within the angular and brightness contrast levels achieved. Eight sets of 1000&nbsp;×&nbsp;0.06 s images were obtained and processed by our standard reduction pipeline (Howell et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib77"></span>2011). Fig. <span id="jumplink-fig6"></span>6 shows our final contrast curves and the <span>|$832~\rm nm$|</span> reconstructed speckle image. These high-resolution observations revealed no companion star brighter than 5 magnitudes below that of the target star from the 8-m telescope diffraction limit (<span>⁠|$20~\rm mas$|⁠</span>) out to 1.2 arcsec. At the distance of TOI-715 (<span>⁠|$42.4~\rm pc$|⁠</span>) these angular limits correspond to spatial limits of 0.84 to <span>|$50.9~\rm au$|⁠</span>.</p>                    <div data-id="fig6" data-content-id="fig6" swap-content-for-modal="true"><p>Figure 6.</p><div><p><img src="https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/mnras/527/1/10.1093_mnras_stad1439/1/m_stad1439fig6.jpeg?Expires=1709837503&amp;Signature=pm6AmDShhJbqLyB0apWBuv4gWkYH813Hm82Srzq4iQ5EWqepgyxVOy1kiMFRhWWZMoCkJWymlusQElTehItdgDkTAg5ZcahgDFhnrwTc0wXgqejCLTIFaqCtGPdLi8-H8TFyY9ETE3kdA3JMrD~7K0QjWJdUUNZGUh1Q2slyxB~MlH4HG2unQXHwDAaZFWUrjnEaTqqyq1tuaw2Y773QzGY53jxOwvBOdgQvE5wic7Kk8QaEqCYgTmZnlhK33JjhdIw~MWGI5c1uVFrOL3GDf1xK-AbALZXqqDlWyiRQlkEH3fKTM~rZOcPjSysSbIB4yLLVZs8asd3R~kDF2bPAgw__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA" alt="Plot showing the 5σ speckle imaging contrast curves in both filters as a function of the angular separation out to 1.2 arcsec, the end of speckle coherence.

Images are calibrated and aligned before performing aperture photometry on the 500 brightest sources detected; <span>prose</span> then performs differential photometry (Broeg, Fernández&nbsp;&amp; Neuhäuser <span id="jumplink-bib16"></span>2005) on the target star to extract the light curve. Individual light curves are detrended for airmass, sky background and FWHM (full width at half maximum) using second order polynomials in time, and they are then modelled using <span>exoplanet</span> (Foreman-Mackey et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib51"></span>2021b).</p><p>We observed TOI-715.01 for the first time on the night of 2021 September 26 with all four telescopes simultaneously (Io, Europa, Ganymede, Callisto) using the <em>Sloan-r′</em> filter and <span>|$\rm 120$|</span>-s exposures. Cloudy skies during the transit caused some large systematics in three out of four telescopes, although this did not prevent the transit from being detected. The fourth telescope, Ganymede, closed during the weather alert, causing only the ingress to be detected.</p><p>We re-observed TOI-715.01 on the night of 2021 November 24 with three of our telescopes. We collected <span>|$\rm 13$|</span>-s exposures using the custom filter <em>I</em> + <em>z</em>′ (Sebastian et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib156"></span>2021). Observations were once again hampered by the untimely appearance of clouds, which affected the in-transit precision of our observations. Fortunately, the transit was still detected with all three instruments despite the overcast conditions.</p>                    <h4 scrollto-destination="422951118" id="422951118" data-legacy-id="sec4-2-3">4.2.3 TRAPPIST-South</h4>
<p>We observed four transits of TOI-715.01 with TRAPPIST-South (TS; Gillon et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib63"></span>2011; Jehin et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib80"></span>2011), located in ESO La Silla Observatory in Chile. This 0.6-m telescope is equipped with a FLI ProLine PL3041-BB camera and a back-illuminated CCD with a pixel size of 0<span>|${_{.}^{\prime\prime}}$|</span>64, providing a total field of view of <span>|$22\,\mathrm{arcmin} \, \times \, 22\,\mathrm{arcmin}$|</span> for an array of <span>|$2048\, \times \, 2048$|</span> pixels. TS is a Ritchey–Chrétien telescope with F/8 and is equipped with a German equatorial mount.</p><p>All four transits were observed with the custom <em>I</em> + <em>z</em>′ filter to maximize the photometric precision. The observations took place on 2021 April 25, 2021 September 26, 2021 November 24, and 2022 April 7, with exposure times of 50s, 70s, 120s, and 90s, respectively. We reduced the images using <span>prose</span> pipeline (Garcia et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib58"></span>2021, <span id="jumplink-bib59"></span>2022) to extract optimal light curves. Individual light curves were then modeled using the <span>exoplanet</span> (Foreman-Mackey et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib51"></span>2021b) package and detrended using a second order polynomial of airmass, FWHM and sky background. None of the observations suffered weather losses.</p><p>We additionally observed TOI-715 on 2022 October 25 during a partial transit of the second candidate (.02) but the target was too low during the event. The observation was therefore inconclusive.</p>                    <h4 scrollto-destination="422951122" id="422951122" data-legacy-id="sec4-2-4">4.2.4 ExTrA</h4>
<p>ExTrA (Bonfils et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib14"></span>2015) is a near-infrared (0.85–1.55 <span>|$\rm \,\mu m$|⁠</span>) multi-object spectrograph fed by three 0.6 m telescopes located at La Silla observatory. We observed four full transits of TOI 715.01 on 2021 February 26, 2021 April 25, 2022 February 8, and 2022 April 7. We observed the first three transits using two telescopes, and the fourth using three; all observations were carried out with 8 arcsec aperture fibers. For both nights, we used the spectrograph’s low resolution mode (<em>R</em> ∼ 20) and 60s exposures. Five fibre positioners are used at the focal plane of each telescope to collect light from the target and four comparison stars. As comparison stars, we also observed 2MASS J07381369−7347351, 2MASS J07410628−7341297, 2MASS J07393394−7330535, and 2MASS J07372328−7321411 with <em>J</em>-magnitude (Skrutskie et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib159"></span>2006) and <em>T</em><sub>eff</sub> (Gaia Collaboration <span id="jumplink-bib57"></span>2021) similar to TOI-715.

<p>We observed a transit of TOI-715.01 with Campo Catino Austral Observatory (OACC-CAO), located in El Sauce Observatory in the Atacama desert in Chile, on the night of 2021 November 24. The telescope is a <span>|$\rm 0.6\, m$|</span> Planewave CDK 24 arcsec with a Planewave L600 mount, equipped with an FLI filter wheel with <em>Sloan</em> filters and an FLI PL16803 camera with 4096&nbsp;×&nbsp;4096 <span>|$9~\rm \,\mu m$|</span> pixels.

<p>We make use of the statistical validation package <span>triceratops</span><sup><span id="jumplink-fn14"></span>14</sup> (Giacalone&nbsp;&amp; Dressing <span id="jumplink-bib60"></span>2020; Giacalone et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib61"></span>2021) to assess the probability of the planet hypothesis for TOI-715.01 and TIC 271971130.02. <span>Triceratops</span> calculates the flux contribution from nearby stars to check if any could be responsible for the transit signal. It then calculates the relative probabilities of a range of transiting planet (TP) and eclipsing binary (EB) scenarios using light curve models fitted to the phase-folded photometry. In the first instance we find that the false positive probabilities (FPP) are 0.403 and 0.592 for candidates .01 and .02, respectively when examining the <em>TESS</em> data, while the threshold for validation is 0.015. For candidate .01, we make use of our follow-up photometry by folding in the four TRAPPIST-South light curves. We choose these as they were observed with the custom <em>I&nbsp;+&nbsp;z’</em> filter (which is very similar to the <em>TESS</em> bandpass) and all four are at different epochs.</p><p>With this phase-folded subset of our follow-up photometry, we find that the false positive probability reduces to 0.0107, placing it below the threshold for statistical validation. To similarly reduce the FPP for TIC 271971130.02, we will need to collect ground-based photometry to confirm the event on-target or rule out events on nearby stars (such an observation was scheduled from Hazelwood Observatory but cancelled due to bad weather).</p>                    <h4 scrollto-destination="422951130" id="422951130" data-legacy-id="sec4-3-1">4.3.1 Statistical validation conclusions</h4>
<p>With a FPP of 0.0107 TOI-715.01 is now below the customary threshold for statistical validation (0.015; Giacalone et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib61"></span>2021); we therefore consider the planet validated and refer to it as TOI-715 b. TIC 271971130.02 does not yet meet the criterion for statistical validation, and is therefore classified as a ‘likely transiting planet’ until more evidence such as ground-based photometry is collected.</p>                    <h2 scrollto-destination="422951132" id="422951132" data-legacy-id="sec5">5 GLOBAL PHOTOMETRIC ANALYSIS</h2>
<p>We carried out a global photometric analysis of the <em>TESS</em> photometry and the data sets described in Section&nbsp;<span id="jumplink-sec4-3"></span><a href="#sec4-3">4.3</a> using <span>allesfitter</span> (Günther&nbsp;&amp; Daylan <span id="jumplink-bib67"></span>2019, <span id="jumplink-bib68"></span>2021), a flexible and publicly available <span>python</span>-based inference package. We exclude all partial transits, as well as the transit obtained from OACC (due to large scatter in the data) from our analysis, leaving 15 full transits from our ground-based facilities. <span>Allesfitter</span> generates light curve models using <span>Ellc</span> (Maxted <span id="jumplink-bib117"></span>2016), and Gaussian Process (GP) models using <span>Celerite</span> (Foreman-Mackey et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib49"></span>2017). The best fitting models are then chosen using either a nested sampling algorithm via <span>Dynesty</span> (Speagle <span id="jumplink-bib161"></span>2020), or MCMC sampling with <span>Emcee</span> (Foreman-Mackey et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib48"></span>2013). For all modeling in this paper, we make use of the nested sampling algorithm as it calculates the Bayesian evidence at each step in the sampling; this allows us to compare the Bayesian evidence for different models by calculating the Bayes Factor (Kass&nbsp;&amp; Raftery <span id="jumplink-bib86"></span>1995).

To allow the colour-dependent transit depth to be a free parameter in our models, we also fit each light curve for a dilution parameter (<em>D</em>) which we give a uniform prior between −1 and 1. We fix the dilution of the <em>TESS</em> observations at 0 as the PDCSAP light curve is already corrected for crowding (Stumpe et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib168"></span>2012), and use the transit depth as the reference depth; we then use <span>Allesfitter</span>’s ‘<span>|$\rm coupled\_with$|</span>’ functionality to ensure that the dilution and quadratic limb-darkening coefficients are fitted together for all observations taken in the same photometric band.</p><p>We use the <span>python</span> package <span>PyLDTK</span> (Parviainen&nbsp;&amp; Aigrain <span id="jumplink-bib135"></span>2015) and the PHOENIX stellar atmosphere library (Husser et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib79"></span>2013) to calculate quadratic limb-darkening coefficients for each photometric band.

We select the <em>Matérn 3/2</em> kernel as implemented by <span>Celerite</span> due to its versatility and its ability to model both long and short term trends. We fit for two GP hyperparameters for each ExTrA telescope: the amplitude scale, σ, and the length scale, ρ. We place wide uniform priors on these terms. For all other telescopes, we make use of a hybrid spline to model the baseline. <span>Allesfitter</span> also fits an ‘error scaling’ term to account for white noise in the data.</p><p>The initial fits (1-planet circular, and 1-planet eccentric) both confirm that TOI-715 b is a <span>|$\rm 1.550\pm 0.061\, \rm R_{\oplus }$|</span> planet with an equilibrium temperature of <span>|$\rm 234\pm 12\, \rm K$|⁠</span>.

We test two further models to seek evidence of a second planet in the system, starting by fixing the linear ephemerides of planet b and allowing the mid-time of each individual transit to vary. This model is motivated by the second candidate’s proximity to a 1<sup>st</sup> order 4:3 mean-motion resonance with the first planet. If the second candidate is real, we might expect for these planets to experience mutual gravitational interactions exciting transit timing variations (TTVs).</p><p>We place a wide uniform prior on each transit mid-time, corresponding to the linear predicted mid-time <span>|$\pm \, 60$|</span> min. We find that due to the low SNR of individual transits in the <em>TESS</em> data, the transit mid-times are not well constrained for events observed only by <em>TESS</em>. However, transits observed simultaneously by several ground-based observatories have significantly less scatter and smaller error bars. In these events, we see evidence suggesting TTVs of up to 5 min, although the Bayesian evidence for this model is lower than for the two linear models tested. Models with linear ephemerides are preferred, with Bayes Factors of ∼9.5 and ∼16 for the circular and eccentric models respectively. We note that we did not test a fixed linear ephemerides fit with a 2-planet model as the individual transits in <em>TESS</em> for the second candidate have even lower SNR and we have no ground-based transits at the time of writing.</p><p>The final model we test is a 2-planet circular Keplerian model. We fit for all the same parameters as before, but now additionally include the transit parameters for the second candidate. The phase-folded <em>TESS</em> photometry for the second candidate is presented in Fig. <span id="jumplink-fig10"></span>10; the fitted and derived parameters for planet b resulting from the 2-planet model are consistent with those emerging from all previous models. Also noteworthy is that the host density as calculated by <span>allesfitter</span> following Seager&nbsp;&amp; Mallén-Ornelas (<span id="jumplink-bib154"></span>2003) with the transit parameters of the second candidate is <span>|$\rm 22.7\pm 3.0\, \rm g\, cm^{-3}$|⁠</span>, which is within 1σ of the stellar density prior of <span>|$\rm 23.1\pm 3.2\, \rm g\, cm^{-3}$|⁠</span>, suggesting that both signals are produced over the same star.

<p>The radius valley, as identified in the <em>Kepler</em> sample by Fulton et&nbsp;al. (<span id="jumplink-bib53"></span>2017), shows a lack of close-in (<span>⁠|$P\lt 100~\rm d$|⁠</span>) planets with sizes between <span>|$1.5-2~\rm R_{\oplus }$|⁠</span>; TOI-715 b’s <span>|$1.55~\rm R_\oplus$|</span> appears just inside this underpopulated region of parameter space. The importance of the radius valley lies in its potential to teach us about planetary formation and post-formation evolution (e.g. Owen&nbsp;&amp; Wu <span id="jumplink-bib134"></span>2017; Ginzburg et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib65"></span>2018; Venturini et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib187"></span>2020), and hence planets inside this gap are crucial in furthering our understanding of the factors that sculpt it.</p><p>The location and slope of the radius valley has been shown to depend on the properties of the host star (e.g. Fulton&nbsp;&amp; Petigura <span id="jumplink-bib52"></span>2018; Gupta&nbsp;&amp; Schlichting <span id="jumplink-bib70"></span>2019; Berger et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib12"></span>2020), and Cloutier&nbsp;&amp; Menou (<span id="jumplink-bib25"></span>2020) and Van Eylen et&nbsp;al. (<span id="jumplink-bib185"></span>2021) recently re-examined this for low-mass stars. Cloutier&nbsp;&amp; Menou (<span id="jumplink-bib25"></span>2020) looked at the small, close-in planet distribution around stars cooler than <span>|$4700\, \rm K$|</span> and found that the slope is opposite in sign compared with FGK stars, and also that the peaks of the planet radius distributions are shifted toward smaller planets. According to this, the center of the radius valley also shifts towards smaller radii. The sample examined in this study contained planets discovered by <em>Kepler</em> and <em>K2</em>, and was corrected for completeness. This work states that planets falling between their measured radius valley and the one measured by Martinez et&nbsp;al. (<span id="jumplink-bib116"></span>2019) for Sun-like stars are so-called ‘keystone planets’, crucial for further understanding the radius valley around low-mass stars. By this metric TOI-715 b’s radius of <span>|$\rm 1.55\, R_{\oplus }$|</span> is just below the boundary of <span>|$\rm 1.66\, R_{\oplus }$|</span> for a period of 19.288&nbsp;d, falling within the super-Earth category.</p><p>Van Eylen et&nbsp;al. (<span id="jumplink-bib185"></span>2021), however, used a significantly smaller sample, restricted to confirmed and well-characterized planets, with masses and radii measured to at least 20&nbsp;per cent precision, orbiting stars cooler than 4000 K. They found a slope in radius-period space opposite in sign compared with Cloutier&nbsp;&amp; Menou (<span id="jumplink-bib25"></span>2020), and therefore consistent in sign with FGK stars as measured by, for instance, Martinez et&nbsp;al. (<span id="jumplink-bib116"></span>2019). They do, however, find that the valley shifts towards smaller radii for later spectral types. Contrary to the work of Cloutier&nbsp;&amp; Menou (<span id="jumplink-bib25"></span>2020), the functional form of the radius valley derived in this study places TOI-715 b above the radius valley and with the population of sub-Neptunes.</p><p>In Fig. <span id="jumplink-fig11"></span>11 we present the current sample of exoplanets orbiting stars cooler than <span>|$T_\mathrm{eff}\, =\, 4000\, \rm K$|</span> with planetary radii measured to better than 10 &nbsp;per cent precision<sup><span id="jumplink-fn15"></span>15</sup> in radius-period space.

What is evident is that precise characterization of planets such as TOI-715 b that fall <em>between</em> the various definitions of the low-mass star radius valley is essential to understand whether or not this bimodality will eventually be borne out by the data.</p>                    <div data-id="fig11" data-content-id="fig11" swap-content-for-modal="true"><p>Figure 11.</p><div><p><img src="https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/mnras/527/1/10.1093_mnras_stad1439/1/m_stad1439fig11.jpeg?Expires=1709837503&amp;Signature=T4rTMM2q-ynuQ-ul9GKejC10NuymqfBpBHOuvo0fYUfhUksmXfaM7bPOCpl0hXjbp2~6ZV~X0adFGBCOG0BFdEVTxfUu-kU8yx3DxTJI10o3aOuN-Pz6YoylqlxrODPqEU5qwZruEP98qkpL~tP-dgyrY4bPXwQH2NO0bPFWPGWfnaDmajzezmXTTZQTYc8yl3YCC0bDYUUgAdS2VBlZJAYd0iIYGvOVCyuNsoe~JzCFpKZ7VPDnNPOtbpzHA3VOUuiXxL8gw5HdE1fUCMBQ-JXUx8Glt9~2-C~vFB1rX2TyL811dUs0Gd4BJSeiJPSAeAHnn-4xdkTxQd0q3UOK5Q__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA" alt="Plot of the current sample of planets orbiting hosts cooler than 4000 K in radius-period space.

<p>Luque&nbsp;&amp; Pallé (<span id="jumplink-bib108"></span>2022) recently demonstrated using a sample of planets with precisely measured radii (to at least &lt;8&nbsp;per cent) and masses (to at least &lt;25&nbsp;per cent) that small planets orbiting low-mass stars in fact likely have a density gap rather than a radius valley. The results of that study indicate that small planets come in three flavours: rocky, water-worlds and gassy. For planets smaller than <span>|$2\, \rm R_{\oplus }$|</span> they find a clear bi-modality in density which allow us to estimate the mass of TOI-715 b in both the rocky (<span>⁠|$\rm \sim \, 7M_{\oplus }$|⁠</span>) and water-world (<span>⁠|$\rm \sim \, 2M_{\oplus }$|⁠</span>) scenarios; both different from the Chen&nbsp;&amp; Kipping (<span id="jumplink-bib23"></span>2017) estimate of <span>|$\rm \sim \, 3.5M_{\oplus }$|</span> and the rocky and volatile-rich predictions from Otegi, Bouchy&nbsp;&amp; Helled (<span id="jumplink-bib132"></span>2020) (<span>⁠|$\rm \sim \, 4.1M_{\oplus }$|</span> and <span>|$\rm \sim \, 3.5M_{\oplus }$|</span> respectively). While this result is very promising for our understanding of the composition of small planets around low-mass stars, their sample contained only 34 planets; therefore continued systematic characterization of these systems with consistent sample selection criteria remains crucial to understand this distribution and ultimately the composition of planets around M dwarfs.</p>                    <h3 scrollto-destination="422951160" id="422951160" data-legacy-id="sec6-3">6.3 Prospects for a mass measurement of TOI-715 b</h3>
<p>Given the faintness of TOI-715, the only southern hemisphere instrument currently capable of the precision required to measure the mass of planet b is ESPRESSO at the VLT (Very Large Telescope Pepe et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib137"></span>2010). If the planet is rocky and has a mass of <span>|$\rm \sim 7\, M_{\oplus }$|⁠</span>, then we calculate a predicted RV semi-amplitude of <span>|$\rm 4.5\, m\, s^{-1}$|⁠</span>. From ESPRESSO’s exposure time calculator (ETC) we find that we could achieve a precision of <span>|$\rm 7.4\, m\, s^{-1}$|</span> per measurement, meaning that for a 25&nbsp;per cent precision on the mass of the planet, 44 spectra need to be collected, with <span>|$\rm 1800\, s$|</span> exposures and SNR <span>|$\rm \sim$|</span> 14. For this, we assume that TOI-715 is a relatively slow rotator (<span>⁠|$\rm vsini \lesssim 2\, km\, s^{-1}$|⁠</span>) which is not unusual for old M dwarfs that do not show significant stellar activity (Moutou et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib123"></span>2017; Reiners et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib144"></span>2022).</p><p>However the ETC is usually pessimistic. Based on observed radial-velocity precision of mid-M type planet-host stars obtained with ESPRESSO we expect a slightly better performance for this instrument. Observations of Proxima Cen (M5V) resulted in a mean precision of <span>|$\rm 0.6\, m\, s^{-1}$|</span> (Suárez Mascareño et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib170"></span>2020), which is about 40&nbsp;per cent better than the ETC predicts. A similar case is LHS 1140 (M3V), for which a mean precision of <span>|$\rm 0.8\, m\, s^{-1}$|</span> has been achieved (Lillo-Box et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib104"></span>2020), which is a precision twice better than expected. Empirical results<sup><span id="jumplink-fn16"></span>16</sup> for M dwarfs using the MAROON-X spectrograph at Gemini North (Seifahrt et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib157"></span>2020) found a more than 40 &nbsp;per cent increase in precision between M0 and M6 dwarf stars. The ESPRESSO ETC assumes an M2 spectral type to predict the RV precision. Thus, this apparent increase in RV precision for mid-M dwarfs, compared to early M dwarfs can explain the observed difference in performance.</p><p>Since TOI-715 is an M4 dwarf, we can conservatively expect a 20&nbsp;per cent better RV precision compared to the ETC (thus a precision of <span>|$\rm \sim 5.9\, m\, s^{-1}$|⁠</span>). This means a 25&nbsp;per cent precision on the mass of the planet can be reached with only <span>|$\rm \sim 30$|</span> spectra (<span>⁠|$\rm 1800\, s$|</span> exposures; SNR ∼ 14). This amounts to 15&nbsp;h of telescope time, which is not unrealistic for a planet of this importance.</p><p>If however, TOI-715 b is in fact a ‘water world’, then a mass of <span>|$\rm \sim 2\, M_{\oplus }$|</span> would produce an RV semi-amplitude of just <span>|$\rm 1.3\, m\, s^{-1}$|⁠</span>. In this case 150&nbsp;h of telescope time are needed to constrain the mass with 25&nbsp;per cent precision. Should the density bi-modality for small planets around M dwarfs suggested by Luque&nbsp;&amp; Pallé (<span id="jumplink-bib108"></span>2022) be confirmed, a non-detection might enable us to infer the planet’s mass.</p><p>In Section&nbsp;<span id="jumplink-sec5"></span><a href="#sec5">5</a>, we found that there were small hints of transit timing variations (TTVs) in the ground-based transits of TOI-715 b. If the second planet is confirmed and the orbits are commensurate, the masses of both planets could be suitable for characterization using dynamical modelling. Given the low SNR of individual transits and the long orbital periods, such a campaign would be well suited to ASTEP (Antarctic Search for Transiting Exoplanets, Daban et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib35"></span>2010; Schmider et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib152"></span>2022), given its convenient Antarctic location (Dransfield et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib44"></span>2022b).</p>                    <h3 scrollto-destination="422951166" id="422951166" data-legacy-id="sec6-4">6.4 Prospects for detailed atmospheric characterization of TOI-715 b</h3>
<p>The Transmission Spectroscopy Metric (TSM) as established by Kempton et&nbsp;al. (<span id="jumplink-bib88"></span>2018) is often used to quantify the suitability of planets for atmospheric characterization via transmission spectroscopy. We calculate the TSM for TOI-715 b in both mass limits<sup><span id="jumplink-fn17"></span>17</sup> and for TIC 271971130.02, as well as the published sample of planets with <span>|$R_p\, \lt \, 2~\rm R_{\oplus }$|</span> and <span>|$S_p\, \lt \, 1.6~\rm S_{\oplus }$|</span><sup><span id="jumplink-fn18"></span>18</sup> The comparison sample contained 34 planets initially; we then removed the seven planets discovered via radial velocity as these are not known to transit.

We then use <span>Pandexo</span> (Batalha et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib11"></span>2017) to simulate <em>JWST</em> observations in both cases to assess the detectability of atmospheric features. We find that in the low-mass case atmospheric features could be detectable with a single <em>JWST</em> transit if the atmosphere is cloudless. In the higher mass case, we find that extracting meaningful features would require at least five transits, also in the cloud-free case. A secondary atmosphere with higher mean molecular mass could suppress the scale height by more than an order of magnitude, in turn making it challenging to detect atmospheric features of these planets (de Wit et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib189"></span>2016).</p><p>In both mass cases, the carbon dioxide feature centered on <span>|$\rm 4.5\, \,\mu m$|⁠</span>, the methane feature at <span>|$\rm 3.3\, \,\mu m$|</span> and multiple water bands are some of the most accessible atmospheric features with the NIRSpec PRISM, the most suitable instrument for <em>JWST</em> follow-up given the similar brightness of TOI-715 compared to TRAPPIST-1. Detection of these features will constrain the metallicity of the putative planetary atmospheres, providing first hints of the carbon-chemistry of the atmosphere itself (Madhusudhan <span id="jumplink-bib110"></span>2012), and insights into their formation history (Öberg, Murray-Clay&nbsp;&amp; Bergin <span id="jumplink-bib131"></span>2011).</p>                    <h3 scrollto-destination="422951172" id="422951172" data-legacy-id="sec6-5">6.5 Flares and habitability</h3>
<p>Both TOI-715 b and the candidate TIC 271971130.02 lie in an interesting location of the parameter space with regard to insolation, radius, and potential rocky composition, naturally posing questions of their habitability. Many recent prebiotic chemistry and astrobiology studies investigated how life may have originated on Earth and other planets (see e.g. Patel et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib136"></span>2015; Airapetian et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib2"></span>2016; Xu et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib191"></span>2018 and reviews by Sutherland <span id="jumplink-bib172"></span>2017; Kitadai&nbsp;&amp; Maruyama <span id="jumplink-bib92"></span>2018). The first processes leading from inorganic compounds towards RNA precursors likely require a liquid solution (e.g. liquid surface water) and an energy source. For the latter, the host star’s flaring may provide the necessary UV radiation (in the 200–280 nm range) to trigger these early steps (e.g. Rimmer et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib147"></span>2018; Todd et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib177"></span>2018; Rimmer et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib148"></span>2021).</p><p>On the other hand, stellar activity can also pose a significant danger to exoplanets. Strong stellar winds and XUV outbursts can contribute to atmospheric loss (e.g. Atri&nbsp;&amp; Mogan <span id="jumplink-bib9"></span>2020). Even if the atmosphere prevails, coronal mass ejections (charged particle streams) may interact with and dissociate atmospheric ozone (e.g. Tilley et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib176"></span>2019). Without the major atmospheric absorber of harmful UV radiation, the next flares might sterilize existing surface biology.</p><p>We investigate TOI-715’s 24 sectors of TESS data for signs of stellar flaring. We find an average rate of 7 flares per 100&nbsp;d of observations, with a maximum flare amplitude of 5 per cent in relative flux over nearly 2&nbsp;yr of data. This analysis was performed using the <span>stella</span> neural network (Feinstein et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib47"></span>2020) and as part of the TESS flare catalog (Günther et&nbsp;al., in preparation), building on (Günther et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib69"></span>2020). We also compare this flare frequency distribution with the theoretical potential for ozone sterilization (Tilley et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib176"></span>2019) and laboratory thresholds for prebiotic chemistry (Rimmer et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib147"></span>2018). We find that the flaring is likely too rare and not energetic enough to influence either of these effects.</p><p>As TOI-715 is an older star (6.6<span>|$^{+3.2}_{-2.2}$|</span> Gyr), its flaring is likely not as prominent as in younger years, when its planets were forming and prebiotic chemistry steps might have been triggered. Demographic studies of young (&lt;100&nbsp;Myr) and older M dwarfs show that flaring activity decreases with stellar age, likely due to spin-down and a decreasing stellar dynamo (e.g. Feinstein et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib47"></span>2020; Günther et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib69"></span>2020). Thus, one could carefully speculate: if stronger flaring or other processes (volcanoes, impacts, or lightning) had led to astrobiology on TOI-715 b or TIC 271971130.02 several Gyr ago, there might be a chance it could still exist (pending, of course, all other criteria such as atmospheric composition, liquid water, etc. are fulfilled).</p>                    <h2 scrollto-destination="422951177" id="422951177" data-legacy-id="sec7">7 CONCLUSIONS</h2>
<p>In this work, we have presented the discovery, validation and characterization of TOI-715 b, a <span>|$R_{\rm b}= \rm 1.550\pm 0.064\, R_{\oplus }$|</span> habitable zone planet orbiting an M4 star with a period of <span>|$19.288004_{-0.000024}^{+0.000027}$|</span> d.

This work has been supported by a grant from Labex OSUG@2020 (Investissements d’avenir – ANR10 LABX56). This work has been carried out within the framework of the NCCR PlanetS supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation. Some of the observations in the paper made use of the High-Resolution Imaging instrument Zorro obtained under Gemini LLP Proposal Number: GN/S-2021A-LP-105. Zorro was funded by the NASA Exoplanet Exploration Program and built at the NASA Ames Research Center by Steve B. Howell, Nic Scott, Elliott P. Horch, and Emmett Quigley. Zorro was mounted on the Gemini South telescope of the international Gemini Observatory, a program of NSF’s OIR Lab, which is managed by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA) under a cooperative agreement with the National Science Foundation on behalf of the Gemini partnership: the National Science Foundation (United States), National Research Council (Canada), Agencia Nacional de Investigación y Desarrollo (Chile), Ministerio de Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación (Argentina), Ministério da Ciencia, Tecnología, Inovações e Comunicações (Brazil), and Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute (Republic of Korea). The Digitized Sky Surveys were produced at the Space Telescope Science Institute under U.S. Government grant NAG W-2166. The images of these surveys are based on photographic data obtained using the Oschin Schmidt Telescope on Palomar Mountain and the UK Schmidt Telescope. The plates were processed into the present compressed digital form with the permission of these institutions. This work makes use of observations from the LCOGT network. Part of the LCOGT telescope time was granted by NOIRLab through the Mid-Scale Innovations Program (MSIP). MSIP is funded by NSF.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://bhupesh.me/publishing-my-first-ever-dockerfile-optimization-ugit/">https://bhupesh.me/publishing-my-first-ever-dockerfile-optimization-ugit/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39240471">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
    
    <p>I interact with Dockerfiles every day at work, have written a few myself, built containers, and all that. But never published one on the docker hub registry. I wanted to make <a href="https://github.com/Bhupesh-V/ugit"><strong>ugit</strong> - a tool to undo git commands</a> (written as a shell script) available to folks who don’t like installing random shell scripts from the internet.</p>

<p>Yeah, I know, I know. REWRITE IT IN GO/RUST/MAGICLANG. The script is now more than 500+ lines of bash. I am not rewriting it in any other language unless someone holds a gun to my head (or maybe ends up sponsoring??). Moreover, ugit is close to being feature complete (only a few commands left to undo, which are not that commonly used).</p>

<p>Anyway, the rest of the article is about how I went about writing the official Dockerfile for <a href="https://github.com/Bhupesh-V/ugit/blob/master/ugit"><strong>ugit (a shell script)</strong></a> and reduced the image size by almost <strong>40%</strong> (<em>going from 31.4 MB to 17.6 MB</em>) by performing step-by-step guided optimization attempts. I hope this motivates other shell enthusiasts to also publish their scripts as docker images!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>PS: I am not a DevOps or Docker expert, so if you are and see something wrong or something that could be done better, please let me know in the comments below or reachout <a href="https://bhupesh.me/about/#-connect">somewhere</a>. The final docker image is available on <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/bhupeshimself/ugit">docker hub</a></p>

<div><pre><code><span># Use an official Alpine runtime as a parent image</span>

<span># Run ugit when the container launches</span>
<span>CMD</span><span> ["ugit"]</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Looks pretty simple, right? It is. You could copy-paste this Dockerfile and build the image yourself assuming you have ugit cloned in the current directory,</p>

<div><pre><code>docker build <span>-t</span> ugit <span>.</span>
docker run <span>--rm</span> <span>-it</span> <span>-v</span> <span>$(</span><span>pwd</span><span>)</span>:/app ugit
</code></pre></div>

<p>This should successfully run ugit inside the container.</p>

<!-- add screenshot -->

<p><code>ugit</code> requires binaries like <code>bash (&gt;=4.0)</code>, <code>awk</code>, <code>xargs</code>, <code>git</code>, <code>fzf</code>, <code>tput</code>, <code>cut</code>, <code>tr</code>, <code>nl</code>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>We had to install <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/findutils/">findutils</a> because it ships with <code>xargs</code>.</li>
  <li>We had to install <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/coreutils">coreutils</a> because it ships with <code>tr</code>, <code>cut</code> and <code>nl</code>.</li>
  <li><code>ncurses</code> is required by <code>tput</code> (which is used to get the terminal info).</li>
</ul>

<p>That’s all we need to run ugit on a UNIX-based machine or well, a container. The image size sits at <code>31.4 MB</code> at this point. Not bad for a first attempt. Let’s see how we can reduce it further.</p>

<h2 id="path-to-optimization---reducing-image-size-by-40">Path to optimization - reducing image size by 40%</h2>

<p>During our (desperate) micro-optimization attempts in the upcoming sections, we will be covering the following high-level goals:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use multi-stage builds to reduce image size.</li>
  <li>Get rid of binaries like <code>sleep</code>, <code>watch</code>, <code>du</code> etc. Anything that is not required by <code>ugit</code> to run.</li>
  <li>Get rid of unnecessary dependencies that these binaries bring in.</li>
  <li>Get a minimum version of all dependencies that are required by <code>ugit</code> to run.</li>
  <li>Load up only the required binaries and their dependencies in the final image.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="2nd-attempt---alpine-on-alpine">2nd attempt - <code>alpine</code> on <code>alpine</code></h2>

<p>I now choose to create a multi-stage build. The 2nd stage will be used to copy only the required binaries and their dependencies. I again choose to use <code>alpine</code> as the base image for this stage.</p>

<p>A SCRATCH docker image is just an empty file system. It doesn’t have anything at all. To try out a SCRATCH image, you can refer to <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/scratch">docker hub’s README on it</a>.</p>

<p>The only thing you need to know is that everything has to be put together by us. Let’s keep our hands on our hearts and replace <code>alpine</code> with <code>scratch</code>.</p>

<p>Turns out, we broke the bash binary by not shipping its dependencies. Let’s see what we can do about it.</p>

<h3 id="identifying-transitive-dependencies">Identifying transitive dependencies</h3>

<p>Okay, time to talk about transitive dependencies. Our script relies on binaries like <code>git</code>, <code>tput</code>, <code>bash</code>; now some of these utils may have their dependencies.</p>

<p>We technically call these dependencies, shared libraries. Shared libraries are <code>.so</code> (or in Windows <code>.dll</code>, or in OS X <code>.dylib</code>) files. <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ldd.1.html"><strong>ldd</strong></a> is a great tool to identify these dependencies. It lists all the libraries needed by a binary to execute. For example, if we run <code>ldd /bin/bash</code> on a fresh Alpine container, we get the following output:</p>

<div><pre><code>/ <span># ldd /bin/ls</span>
	/lib/ld-musl-aarch64.so.1 <span>(</span>0xffff8c9c0000<span>)</span>
	libc.musl-aarch64.so.1 <span>=&gt;</span> /lib/ld-musl-aarch64.so.1 <span>(</span>0xffff8c9c0000<span>)</span>
/ <span># ldd /bin/bash</span>
	/lib/ld-musl-aarch64.so.1 <span>(</span>0xffffb905a000<span>)</span>
	libreadline.so.8 <span>=&gt;</span> /usr/lib/libreadline.so.8 <span>(</span>0xffffb8f06000<span>)</span>
	libc.musl-aarch64.so.1 <span>=&gt;</span> /lib/ld-musl-aarch64.so.1 <span>(</span>0xffffb905a000<span>)</span>
	libncursesw.so.6 <span>=&gt;</span> /usr/lib/libncursesw.so.6 <span>(</span>0xffffb8e95000<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<h4 id="primer-on-shared-libraries">Primer on shared libraries</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Each lib has a <em>soname</em>, which is the name of the library file without the version number. They start with the prefix <code>lib</code> and end with <code>.so</code>. For example, <code>libpcre2-8.so.0</code> has a soname <code>libpcre2-8.so</code>.</li>
  <li>A fully qualified lib includes the directory where it is located. For example, <code>/usr/lib/libpcre2-8.so.0</code>.</li>
  <li>Each lib has a real name, which is the name of the library file with the version number. For example, <code>libpcre2-8.so.0.3.6</code> could be a real name.</li>
  <li>The hexadecimal is the base memory address where this library is loaded in memory. Not useful for us. We are only interested in the library names. Let’s do it for all the binaries we need to run ugit.</li>
  <li>The path to the right-hand side of <code>=&gt;</code> symbol indicates the real path to that shared library.</li>
  <li>The lib name starting with <code>libc</code>is the C library for that architecture. Remember our “exec /bin/bash: no such file or directory” error? This is the reason we got it. We didn’t ship the C library for our architecture.</li>
</ul>

<p>Below is an excerpt from <a href="https://twitter.com/dcreager/">Douglas Creager’s</a> article on <a href="https://dcreager.net/2017/10/shared-library-versions/">Shared library versions</a> which sums up shared libraries, please read the full article if you want to learn more about shared libraries.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>With a shared library, you compile the library once and install it into a shared location in the filesystem (typically <code>/usr/lib</code> on Linux systems). Any project that depends on that shared library can use that shared, already compiled representation as-is.<br>
Most Linux distributions further reduce compile times by distributing <strong>binary packages</strong> of popular libraries, where the distribution’s packaging system has compiled the code for you. By installing the package, you download a (hopefully signed) copy of the compiled library, and place it into the shared location, all without ever having to invoke the compiler (or any other part of the build chain that produced the library).</p>

</blockquote>

<p>We use a similar approach to identify all the unique dependencies for all the binaries we need to run ugit.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ℹ️ We did this by running a command like <code>for cmd in /bin/*; do echo $cmd; ldd $cmd; done</code></p>

<p>Notice, that we are copying <code>libc.musl-*</code> and <code>ld-musl-*</code> from the builder image. This is because the build for these libs depends on the architecture of the host machine.</p>

<h3 id="shebangs--are-useless">Shebangs <code>#!</code> are useless</h3>

<p>If you look at the very <a href="https://github.com/Bhupesh-V/ugit/blob/master/ugit#L1">first line of ugit</a>, you’ll see a shebang <code>#!/usr/bin/env bash</code>. The use of <code>env</code> is considered a good practice when writing shell scripts, used to tell the OS which shell interpreter to use to run the script, this is ideal in an everyday dev machine. Linux (and older versions of macOS) get shipped with <code>sh</code>, <code>bash</code>, and on top of it, folks install <code>zsh</code> etc.</p>

<p>But since using shebangs is optional, and we already copy the <code>bash</code> binary, we just need to invoke our script using it. This saves us a couple of bytes in the image size as well. Close to 1.9 MB to be precise.</p>

<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExNWNmdHQ3bGQ0czN1eG9vYTlicGd0aXRjeDJqbXg5aXZreTNhM3hoeiZlcD12MV9naWZzX3NlYXJjaCZjdD1n/3o6Mbi2vzeke98ApAA/giphy.gif" alt="get rid of shebang"></p>

<h3 id="a-look-at-terminfo-db">A look at <code>terminfo</code> db</h3>

<p>ugit has colors, thanks to <code>tput</code>. We load up a bare-bones Alpine image with <code>bash</code> and head over to the <code>/etc/terminfo</code> directory. This directory contains the terminal info database.</p>

<div><pre><code>37a1a77f70ed:/app# <span>cd</span> /etc/terminfo/
37a1a77f70ed:/etc/terminfo# <span>ls
</span>a  d  g  k  l  p  r  s	t  v  x
</code></pre></div>

<p>Each of these letter-based “directories” represents different <code>$TERM</code> types. For example, <code>xterm</code> is a terminal type. If you run <code>tput -T xterm colors</code> on your local machine, you’ll get the number of colors your terminal supports. For <code>xterm</code> it should be <code>8</code>, and in the case of <code>xterm-256color</code> it should be <code>256</code>.</p>

<p>Now here’s our chance, to only support 1 terminal type amongst the 40+ that are present in the <code>terminfo</code> db. We can get rid of the rest of the terminal types. This saves us another 97Kb, very little but needed to clear up the clutter.</p>

<div><pre><code><span># copy terminfo database for only xterm-256color</span>

<p>Yes, but there are 2 reasons why I didn’t go any further:</p>

<h3 id="reason-1-pin-minimum-version-of-fzf">Reason 1: Pin minimum version of <code>fzf</code>?</h3>

<p>At the time of writing ugit, the script relied on <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/releases/tag/0.20.0"><code>fzf</code> minimum version <code>0.20.0</code></a>, it’s granted that the latest version is going to be larger than the minimum required version. So we should pin the old version, right? No. because then it introduces security vulnerabilities with fzf’s dependencies, i.e., Golang. As reported by <code>docker scout quickview</code>, the older version of Golang has a total of 66 security issues. Maybe they affect the image, maybe they don’t. But I am not taking that risk, I want to keep the image as clean as possible.</p>

<p>At the time of writing ugit, I relied on <a href="https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/bash/"><code>bash</code> version <code>4.0</code></a>. Both tr and cut could be replaced, if I shifted to a newer version of bash. i.e, <em>5.0</em>. And that my friends is a breaking change. Getting rid of and would have saved me a couple of bytes, but I didn’t want to break the script for folks who are still on bash 4.0. It doesn’t matter if I am the only one left, my machine still has bash.</p>

<h2 id="you-didnt-try-docker-slim">You didn’t try <code>docker-slim</code>?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>I did, it did slim down my image, but it also broke the script with missing dependencies. Slim is great, the reader should check it out. Unfortunately, I couldn’t get it to work for ugit in my limited time.</li>
  <li>Moreover, I wanted to learn how to do it with my own hands, rather than rely on a tool to do it for me.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="you-didnt-try-docker-squash">You didn’t try <code>docker-squash</code>?</h2>

<p>I did, and the size optimization was nearly negligible. Here’s a log of the squash process which I ran on a Linux (AMD) machine (ignore the size of the image, since we are on different architecture, the image size is different):</p>

<p>Microsoft's adoption of Rust continues apace if a posting on the IT titan's careers website is anything to go by.</p>
<p>Although headcount at Microsoft might currently be down – by two percent compared to the previous year – recruitment persists at the Windows giant. In this case, the company is forming a team of Rustaceans to tackle a platform move away from C#.</p>
<p>The job, a principal software architect for Microsoft 365, has responsibilities that include "guiding technical direction, design and implementation of Rust component libraries, SDKs, and re-implementation of existing global scale C# based services to Rust."</p>

    

<p>According to the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://jobs.careers.microsoft.com/global/en/job/1633482/Principal-Software-Architect">post</a>, spotted by <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://mspoweruser.com/microsoft-forms-new-team-to-help-rewrite-core-windows-components-into-rust-from-c-c/">MSPowerUser</a>, the job lurks within the Substrate App Platform group, part of the Microsoft 365 Core Platform organization. The Substrate does the heavy lifting behind the scenes for Microsoft's cloud services, making a rewrite into Rust quite a statement of intent.</p>

        


        

<p>Microsoft said: "We are forming a new team focused on enabling the adoption of the Rust programming language as the foundation to modernizing global scale platform services, and beyond."</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/09/27/servo_returns/">Rusty revenant Servo returns to render once more</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The company has had an interest in Rust for a while. In 2023, the director of OS security for Windows <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/04/27/microsoft_windows_rust/">announced</a> the arrival of Rust in the Windows kernel and the language has been making its way into multiple components over the years.</p>
<p>Microsoft, alongside companies such as Meta and AWS, is a platinum member of the Rust Foundation. Considering the growing enthusiasm for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/01/26/memory_safety_mainstream/">memory-safe programming</a>, something Rust delivers with far less effort than the likes of C++, Microsoft's move is unsurprising. However, the company's desire to shift existing C#-based services to Rust will raise a few eyebrows among the developer community.</p>
<p>Memorably, a Microsoft engineer had to rapidly <span>backpedal</span> issue a clarification after <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2018/06/18/microsoft_roundup/">proudly proclaiming</a> that Office 365 was being ported to JavaScript. In this instance, while Microsoft remains committed to C#, at least in public, its actions over the last few years and the job posting are indications that the company is keeping its options open.</p>

        

<p>It is also an indicator of the direction of travel for engineers mulling what new skills to pick up in an increasingly competitive world. ®</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
       <p id="e5lGRE2sAR9">One day over the summer, Piers Corbyn picked up a punnet of strawberries in the Aldi supermarket in Greenwich. He then went to the help desk and placed £1.19 in change on the counter. The controversial climate change denier and anti-vaxxer (and brother of former Labour leader Jeremy)—who, during the pandemic, released an unspeakable music video in which he sang “wearing a mask is like trying to keep a fart in your trousers” (the research is awaiting peer review)—was making a political point. This particular branch does not accept cash payments but tracks customers as they shop, before charging them via an app as they exit. Welcome to the cashless utopia—or, as Corbyn calls it, dystopia.</p><p id="eR4jAqSDVA0">Corbyn wasn’t having this Orwellian development. “So you people take that money—£1.19—and I will take my strawberries outside,” he tells staff, who, on the video he released on social media, can be heard remonstrating with him. “You can’t take that,” shouts one worker off camera, who advises him the police have been called. “If you want to call the police, call the police. I’ve paid my legal tender,” Corbyn retorts as he pushes his way through security gates designed only to be activated by the app. “Don’t break the doors,” shouts the same Aldi worker.&nbsp;</p><p id="euI88QTvOwk">Once outside, Corbyn victoriously hands out strawberries to supporters, telling them: “I paid by legal tender in this dystopian place.” “You should be able to spend whatever you want. It’s an absolute joke,” claims one of his supporters in the video.</p><p id="eYunPanMAuk">There are several problems with what Corbyn did, not least pompously calling supermarket workers “you people”. First, there is a Sainsbury’s opposite that almost certainly does take cash and whose strawberries, I imagine, are no less tasty than Aldi’s. More importantly, as critics pointed out on social media, Corbyn doesn’t grasp the concept of legal tender. “Most people think it means the shop has to accept the payment form. But that’s not the case,” explains the Bank of England website. “Legal tender has a narrow technical meaning which has no use in everyday life. It means that if you offer to fully pay off a debt to someone in legal tender, they can’t sue you for failing to repay.” In everyday life, shop owners can choose what payment they accept. If, say, you produce a £50 note to pay for a bunch of bananas, it’s perfectly legal for the shopkeeper to make sarcastic remarks and refuse your offer.</p><div><p id="ehtnQfv-GPZ">Physical cash, to the chagrin of Piers Corbyn, is in decline. It’s in such short supply that, in August, the Treasury moved to protect public demand for physical money by announcing that banks would be fined for failing to provide free access to cash withdrawals for consumers and businesses. “Whilst the growing choice and convenience of digital payments is great, cash has an important and continuing role to play,” said Andrew Griffith, economic secretary to the Treasury at the time. “People shouldn’t have to trek for hours to withdraw a tenner to put in someone’s birthday card—nor should businesses have to travel large distances to deposit cash takings.”</p></div><p id="enowLgIzX4Rv">But if the supply of cash is being safeguarded, is there really demand for it? When did you last put folding money inside a birthday card? According to research published in September by UK Finance, a trade association, nearly 22m Britons used cash only once a month or not at all in 2022. Just under one million mainly used cash. Since 2017, payments made by debit cards (including with phones and watches) have overtaken those made in physical cash. The trend may have been hastened by Covid: during lockdown, fewer retailers than ever wanted the loose change from Piers Corbyn’s or anybody else’s trousers, for fear that it could spread infection. But the decline is structural: the volume of UK payments that do not involve cash rose from 45 to 85 per cent in the decade to 2021.</p><p id="e4MTKlXkr_de">That said, something striking happened once the pandemic eased. For the first time in a decade, cash payments rose—admittedly only by 7 per cent, but bucking the longer-term trend. Why? UK Finance cites anecdotal evidence that, in a cost-of-living crisis and with inflation for a while into double figures, people were finding it easier to manage their money by paying in cash.</p><p id="eXa6-VaQ2Op">The long-term decline in the use of cash may be disappointing to one man in particular: King Charles III. After an unconscionable wait, the septuagenarian is finally getting his mug on the coins of the realm—only for fewer Britons to be using them than did during mummy’s reign. That, perhaps, is a shame, because these rather beautiful new coins that will enter circulation by the end of next year have been devised to nudge those who hold them in their hot little hands to behave in two socially interesting ways. Each coin has the denomination marked out in large numerals next to images of Britain’s flora and fauna, including threatened species. The 1p coin, for instance, depicts a hazel dormouse, which has seen its population halve since 2007. The 10p features a capercaillie, the world’s largest grouse, which can be found in a small part of Scotland and is threatened with extinction. Rebecca Morgan, director at the Royal Mint, explained the value of this new coinage: “The large numbers will be very appealing to children who are learning to count and about the use of money. Also, the animals and everything you see on these coins will appeal to children. They are great conversation starters.”</p><div><p id="e7gGGYCDGHx">One of the great joys of paying in cash is that it doesn’t leave a digital trail. Physical money can do things—encourage numeracy, make us realise that we need to act to save the capercaillie before it’s too late—that swiping a debit card on a soulless digital reader never will.</p></div><p id="eZYI0dWiZ7qH">The decline in cash is unwelcome, not just to Piers Corbyn, kings and the Mint’s design team, but to those who, voluntarily or otherwise, don’t have bank accounts. It may also create understandable worries regarding the drift of our digitised societies to a place where our every keystroke, phone call and eyeball roll is digitally harvested—by shady tech bros with shareholders to satisfy or authoritarian rulers with dubious agendas—in ways that would make Big Brother envious.&nbsp;</p><p id="ewkPaO3ab99">Cash, by contrast, is an “anonymous bearer instrument”, meaning it is traded without any records and payable to anyone (the opposite is an “order instrument” payable to a specific person). The Piers Corbynites apparently believe that cash liberates us from totalitarian oversight by the Man. Unless, of course, you decide, as Corbyn did when he took his stand in Aldi, to film the exchange and post it online.&nbsp;</p><p id="ez9ug1oQfPM">If the Orwellian ramifications of the rise of cashlessness seem far-fetched, consider what happened in Kenya last August. As Corbyn was paying for his strawberries in Greenwich, thousands were queuing in Nairobi to have their eyeballs scanned as part of the “Worldcoin” project, founded by OpenAI chief Sam Altman. In exchange for handing over their biometric data, some 350,000 Kenyans each received 25 free crypto tokens, worth approximately $50. Those tokens were transferred directly via Kenya’s main mobile payments app, M-Pesa.</p><p>

</p><p id="etk8c4Kcpcu">But Worldcoin faced what’s being called a techlash over this project, not least because it seems like dystopian ­science fiction. A hardware unit known as an orb scans irises to identify individuals and prove they are human. Being able to verify a person in that way will be a key part of the new digital economy when artificial intelligence is integrated into society, according to the company.</p><p id="eXQXFhlIwfG">When the Kenyan government stepped in a week after Worldcoin’s launch in the east African republic to establish “the authenticity and legality of the aforesaid activities”, it was possibly also motivated by revulsion for what looks like a neo-colonialist enterprise predicated on plundering human data in ways redolent of how British imperialists violently exploited Kenya’s natural resources and human beings.</p><p id="ehhmdS2KRvf">Rachel O’Dwyer, lecturer in digital cultures at the National College of Art and Design in Dublin, argues that Altman’s Worldcoin project is symptomatic of a wider development of major digital platforms now trading your digital identity for “tokens”. “By tokens, I mean money-like things ranging from airtime credit and loyalty points to game tokens… and gift balances.” She also means NFTs—non-fungible tokens—unique digital assets that have turned the art world on its head, inducing it to value not boring old paintings and sculptures but works that exist only digitally.&nbsp;</p><blockquote>
 <p id="egk217C73F">One of the great joys of paying in cash is that it doesn’t leave a digital trail</p>
</blockquote><p id="ebdBQY4Dd_cr">“Tokens have always ghosted the economy of publicly mandated currency, but now they are coming to the fore, threatening to replace money itself. It raises the question: was money only ever a blip?”</p><p id="e0BKfbKk5mmZ">In her riveting new book <em>Tokens: The Future of Money in the Age of the Platform</em>, O’Dwyer argues that online platforms are becoming the new banks. Handing over one’s biometric data can be the condition of admission to this new monetary regime—something O’Dwyer describes as a Faustian pact.</p><p id="eNX-kXUi0wSx">But what does it mean when online platforms become the new banks? The radical dream that began with bitcoin inventor Satoshi Nakamoto’s breakthrough 2008 paper, “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System”, was to cut out untrustworthy middlemen—especially central bankers—and realise a radical future of decentralised authority. This would allow, for instance, Argentine citizens to escape hyperinflation by holding bitcoin, not pesos.&nbsp;</p><div>
    <p><img data-src="https://media.prospectmagazine.co.uk/prod/images/portrait_small_fit/59a462301f32-prospectmar24cover-rgb.jpg" alt="magazine block image" src="https://media.prospectmagazine.co.uk/prod/images/portrait_small_fit/59a462301f32-prospectmar24cover-rgb.jpg"></p>
  </div><p id="edVhsi1I7XK8">Nakamoto’s innovation was creating a distributed ledger, a global registry of transactions that was not held by a single bank—as with a credit card—but by thousands of independent bitcoin “miners”. Because this “blockchain” is held not by a single entity but—at least in theory—by thousands of independent users, the need for a central, third-party authority is obviated and banks might become obsolete.</p><p id="ecQkw47azhR1">Fifteen years on, the dreams behind bitcoin’s radical reinvention of money have not been realised, just as the vision of a decentralised, uncensored, free internet foundered with its commercialisation. The cryptocurrency space has been taken over by charlatans and swindlers.</p><p id="eecckgTWploj">The consequence of all this is that bank-controlled cash appears—at least to those of a dystopian temper—to be at risk of steady replacement by payment in tokens. And examples of that development are not limited to Worldcoin.</p><p id="ep2S_w73OQri">Consider Amazon’s Mechanical Turk, a (bizarrely named) website owned by the vast retail multinational where humans are employed online to do tasks which, for the time being at least, are not suitable for artificial intelligence. This might include identifying specific content in an image or video, writing product descriptions or answering survey questions. The online ad reads: “Make money in your spare time. Get paid for completing simple tasks.” But, as O’Dwyer points out, thousands of Mechanical Turks without US bank accounts are not paid in cash—they are paid in Amazon gift cards.&nbsp;</p><p>

</p><p id="e99vmCaNP114">O’Dwyer argues such closed loops of token-based remuneration constrain freedom, and they are becoming more commonplace. In the United States, for instance, food stamps—known as SNAP benefits—are pre-loaded onto Electronic Benefits Transfer cards. These tokens can be used for fresh produce, but not alcohol. When I suggest to O’Dwyer that this sounds like fairly benign social nudge theory in action, she counters that the tokens cannot be used to pay for hygiene products such as tampons, nor for vitamins or medicines. What’s more, tokens can be used for cold deli food, but not for hot meals. “Why cold, pre-cooked meat but not half a rotisserie chicken? It seems there is something too ‘easy’—too idle, maybe—about buying a hot meal for your family using benefits.”&nbsp;</p><p id="eM_xSZwMu-9D">But such nudging through state payments to change behaviour is not new. In 2003, for instance, the Bolsa Família card was released in Brazil, giving households below the poverty line a monthly stipend of around $20 per vaccinated child attending school. In 2016, the UN World Food Programme trialled a system that issued relief payments through the use of biometrics. Refugees were able to buy items from the supermarket using their biometric data as a credential: all they needed to do was scan their iris to pay for an item. The idea was to improve convenience and prevent fraud. Since that trial, the World Food Programme’s Building Blocks initiative has become the world’s largest humanitarian use of blockchain technology. The WFP estimates it is responsible for financially supporting four million people each month in countries including Bangladesh, Jordan and, since mid-2022, Ukraine. The WFP reckons this technology helps tailor its support to meet humanitarian needs.&nbsp;</p><p id="eAZUghu3cDcN">O’Dwyer, though, has worries about this trend. Tokens can also be programmed to specify not only an exchange value, but a whole range of other terms and conditions that must be met before an exchange will take place. “Whose values are these? We’re not at liberty to know,” O’Dwyer says. This, no doubt, is what worries Piers Corbyn and his followers.</p><p id="eCGGtBg3N1Lr">Unlike him, though, O’Dwyer takes heart from human subversiveness in undermining the values of state-­proffered tokens. In Ireland in the 1980s, she tells me, there was a surfeit of butter resulting from the EU’s Common Agricultural Policy. There was so much butter—piled into great butter mountains, or stacked up like what O’Dwyer drolly calls “Kerrygold bullion”—that butter vouchers were issued to the poor and needy, effectively padding out dole money with food stamps. “MUST NOT BE EXCHANGED FOR ITEMS OTHER THAN BUTTER,” said the booklet that held the vouchers. But people did, with the assistance of sympathetic shopkeepers. The vouchers were accepted as payment for tobacco, alcohol and groceries. “They were passed around. People even put them to non-transactional uses—as a decoy for insurance discs displayed on a car’s windshield, one official paper masquerading as another.” You couldn’t have done that with physical money.&nbsp;</p><p id="eSBSrOaJvVP">I mention this phenomenon to Jen Parker, operations manager of the Oasis Partnership, a charity for supporting vulnerable people in Buckinghamshire. Six months ago, the partnership became involved in a project in High Wycombe to cut down on anti-social begging through the creation of three “diverted giving points”. These are card terminals allowing locals to make donations to groups offering assistance with shelter, food, and drugs and alcohol support. The hope for Thames Valley Police and local councillors backing the scheme was that scammers posing as beggars, deprived of cash handouts, would cease operations, thus reducing street unpleasantness in the town. “We thought it was a good way to ensure funds were given to the homeless community rather than going to services that wouldn’t help that community,” Parker tells me.</p><p id="eK9H_HcYzlB">The scheme also had the added benefit of encouraging locals to donate by swiping their cards—crucial when fewer people than ever have cash in their pockets. “I’m as guilty of this as anyone,” Parker says. “I just don’t carry cash around anymore. In the past I would have donated that way, but for a lot of people that’s not happening anymore, so initiatives like this are important.”&nbsp;</p><p>

</p><p id="eI-DhyI2Lu0U">“We weren’t sure how much money we would make from these diverted giving points, but we planned to consult with homeless people through our… outreach workers and supply them with what they want—sleeping bags, food, whatever.”</p><p id="ewKqQLZZCng3">Sadly, Parker tells me, after six months, the scheme has only raised £200. “Whether that’s because people are not aware of them [the card terminals] I don’t know, but we haven’t much to spend on marketing. It might also be because High Wycombe is not that prosperous. There’s a similar scheme in Windsor which is probably more successful.”</p><p id="edjQZCbhRb2A">When I mention how Chinese beggars are equipped with QR codes, Parker surprises me by being enthusiastic. “It’s quite enterprising and it’s not as though anybody’s being coerced. If people want to give away their private data to help homeless beggars, that’s their choice. My concern would be, is the homeless person being paid a fair wage for effectively doing this work for these companies? If they are, then it seems quite a good system.</p><p id="eOiCPTNNd-Vy">“We have to think of new ways of financially supporting homeless people because their days of shaking a bucket for cash are over.”</p><blockquote>
 <p id="e8LhG1KQeAG">Some have rebelled against the money fetish by burning vast wodges of cash</p>
</blockquote><p id="ezgQyNQh96M">If so, that is a big change. Physical money has been part of human society for thousands of years. In early 2021, the world’s earliest known coin-minting site was uncovered in Henan Province, China—it dates back to 650BC.</p><p id="ecJOuoJUPMG">Karl Marx detected a downside to the monetary phenomenon, writing that “Money is the alienated essence of man’s labour and life; and this alien essence dominates him as he worships it.” In our godless age, the money fetish has replaced earlier deities, which has led some to rebel by burning vast wodges of cash. For instance, on 23rd August 1994, the chaotic music duo and performance artists Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty burned £1m of notes behind a boathouse on the Scottish island of Jura. They are not alone in attempting to reduce money’s power by sacrificing it to the flames. Jonathan Harris, also known as MBG (Money Burning Guy), has been burning money since 2007. “I see it as a ritual of disenchantment,” he has explained, “a de-fetishisation of money, a rite that paves the way for a new narrative.” Harris, author of <em>The Money Burner’s Manual: A Guide to Ritual Sacrifice</em>, claims on burnyourmoney.org that he and like-minded cash destroyers have burned £7,266,157 since 1969.&nbsp;</p><p>

</p><p id="etBSIn8Fwa2N">Harris describes himself as high priest of the churchofburn.org, whose homepage is emblazoned with this quote from Charlie Waterhouse of Extinction Rebellion: “Church of Burn is a portal into a glorious world we’re not supposed to see. Where money’s power is revoked, reclaimed and reassigned. A sacrificial rite that rewrites our failing modern world. For once one has burnt money, what else is possible?” Such thinking suggests that Piers Corbyn doesn’t go far enough—he’s still championing physical cash.&nbsp;</p><div><p id="eKEr5fxi3Gm">For those who despise money itself, we should worry not just about the rise of cashless Aldis but such bizarre new phenomena as <em>Axie Infinity</em>. This is an online video game based around NFTs—themselves a mind-bending new development in the way society (or the very online parts of it) understands value—and developed by Vietnamese studio Sky Mavis. The game involves breeding and trading cartoon axolotls (a type of salamander) which can be swapped for money and which earn tokens that can also be swapped for money. During the pandemic, players in the Philippines and elsewhere made this game their work, collecting digital cartoon characters and using them to cash out. They converted the airy nothings of cyberspace into pesos.</p></div><p id="etZq_2LIIgIn">O’Dwyer sounds an optimistic note. Irish butter mountain subversives from the 1980s have their spiritual descendants today. Tokens are “lively and subversive,” she writes. “Users online and on the ground remake them to be paid in informal economies, to communicate, to protest, and to reimagine money… Gig workers, streamers, gamers and sex workers still find ways of transforming online gift cards, wish lists… and gaming tokens into liquid cash.” The future of money, even if it doesn’t include the physical cash that Piers Corbyn romanticises, may not be entirely dystopian.&nbsp;</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p>Ofsted inspectors have been forced to “make up” evidence because the computer system they use to record inspections sometimes crashes, ­wiping all the data, an <em>Observer</em> ­investigation has found.</p><p>Since 2018, <a href="https://educationinspection.blog.gov.uk/2018/09/07/ofsted-is-going-digital/" data-link-name="in body link">inspectors have made live notes on laptops</a> or tablets as they interview staff and observe ­lessons after Ofsted invested in a&nbsp;new ­electronic evidence gathering (EEG) digital platform. However, our investigation has discovered the technology has had serious issues from the beginning, sometimes crashing unexpectedly and losing all notes from interviews, or even whole days of evidence, so that inspectors have to replace those notes from memory without telling the school.</p><p>The <em>Observer</em> spoke to several current or recent inspectors on condition of anonymity who said such problems had been “common” for years, and that senior leaders within <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/ofsted" data-link-name="in body link">Ofsted</a> were aware of this, but “there has been a lot of covering up”.</p><p>After this story was initially published a spokesperson for Ofsted told The <em>Observer</em> that chief inspector Sir Martyn Oliver “is initiating a rapid review to satisfy himself that the EEG and the guidance to inspectors is robust”. The spokesperson added that if schools or inspectors have concerns “we would want to hear about them directly, so we can respond appropriately”.</p><p>Daniel Kebede, general secretary of the National Education Union, said: “This has echoes of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/post-office-horizon-scandal" data-link-name="in body link">the Post Office scandal</a>. The idea of inspectors making lost evidence up, or remembering what they can, is abhorrent. It’s not how schools are allowed to conduct themselves.” He&nbsp;argued that if such a practice has been commonplace, “essentially every inspection conducted over the past five years should be disregarded”.</p><figure id="fd200eb2-689e-4444-89bf-044a32002f17" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-2"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95b52cb4c88a7a26b92a437f1da1ba6bd4231908/0_0_3982_2655/master/3982.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95b52cb4c88a7a26b92a437f1da1ba6bd4231908/0_0_3982_2655/master/3982.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95b52cb4c88a7a26b92a437f1da1ba6bd4231908/0_0_3982_2655/master/3982.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95b52cb4c88a7a26b92a437f1da1ba6bd4231908/0_0_3982_2655/master/3982.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95b52cb4c88a7a26b92a437f1da1ba6bd4231908/0_0_3982_2655/master/3982.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95b52cb4c88a7a26b92a437f1da1ba6bd4231908/0_0_3982_2655/master/3982.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="Daniel Kebede, general secretary of the National Education Union" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95b52cb4c88a7a26b92a437f1da1ba6bd4231908/0_0_3982_2655/master/3982.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="296.70391762933195" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>‘This has echoes of the Post Office scandal’: Daniel Kebede, general secretary of the National Education Union.</span> Photograph: PA Images/Alamy</figcaption></figure><p>A spokesperson for Ofsted said: “We take the processes we use to come to an inspection judgment very seriously.” They stressed that “all judgments are backed up by sufficient evidence” from the inspection team and are also quality assured by senior staff in Ofsted.</p><p>The spokesperson described the EEG tool as a “simple platform used only for recording written evidence” and said: “All inspectors have been issued clear guidance on what to do if they are unable to access the system.”</p><p>One current inspector told the <em>Observer</em>: “In the middle of a meeting with a school, you might suddenly lose all your evidence. The advice is that you mustn’t let on and keep an inscrutable face.”</p><p>He recalled sitting in a hotel trying to input a day’s evidence after the system shut down and he lost everything: “You’re exhausted because the inspection day is long and non-stop and you have documents to read for the next day.”</p><p>Once colleagues at headquarters wanted to do a “rigorous check” on an “Outstanding” grade he had just given a school. “They were asking for evidence but it just wasn’t there,” he said. “There has been a&nbsp;lot of covering up.”</p><p>A second former inspector des­cribed how he sat and watched as evidence from a lengthy interview “just disappeared bit by bit from the screen, like a Banksy artwork self-destructing”. He said: “It’s very hard to avoid giving any body language clues while that’s happening.” And he added: “The instruction then was just to make it up.”</p><p>He added: “I know for a fact that there are senior leaders in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/jun/12/ofsted-school-inspection-ruth-perry-sister" data-link-name="in body link">Ofsted who know about these problems</a>.”</p><p>Ofsted conducted an investigation into EEG last year, which inspectors say confirmed serious issues, but none was aware of any significant changes being made in response.</p><p>Education providers have largely been totally unaware of any of these problems. However, the <em>Observer</em> has seen Ofsted’s written response to a&nbsp;complaint from a school about missing evidence. It says: “You state that during the final meeting the lead inspector declared: ‘It’s all gone’, referring to the evidence on her computer.”</p><p>The response also notes that the draft report included a school motto “which was not actually your school motto”, and that the school had “little confidence in the evidence base”.</p><p>Ofsted rejected this, saying the lead inspector logged that the record of the final meeting had gone but all other evidence was recorded and “subject to enhanced quality assurance”. The <em>Observer</em> understands the school was never shown evidence of this.</p><p>A third former Ofsted inspector said: “I lost everything in the middle of a meeting with a coordinator at the start of a deep dive [into the teaching of a specific subject]. The lead inspector lost everything when she got back to the hotel that night, as did the new inspector on the team.”</p><p>Three inspectors reported that they or colleagues started making notes in Word because they didn’t trust the system, but Ofsted threatened disciplinary action if they didn’t use EEG.</p><p>Julie Price Grimshaw, a former inspector who now advises schools, said while she served in the pen-and-paper era, “lots of inspectors” had told her about times when the system crashed and they lost evidence.</p><p>She said: “It’s clear that substantial chunks, and possibly entire evidence bases, have been disappearing into the ether and are never seen again.”</p><p>Ofsted said that if the EEG system did not work, inspectors were advised to record their evidence in a “reasonable alternative way” and “transfer it to the system at the earliest opportunity”. Ofsted’s spokesperson added: “If during the quality assurance process there was insufficient evidence on the system to support the judgment, inspectors would be instructed to return to the school to gather and record further evidence.”</p></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/02/01/jetbrains_unremovable_ai_assistant/">https://www.theregister.com/2024/02/01/jetbrains_unremovable_ai_assistant/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39238666">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>JetBrains introduced an AI assistant in December to help programmers write code. Now the biz is trying to figure out how to allow its customers to get rid of it.</p>
<p>"JetBrains AI Assistant is similar to GitHub Copilot, but it’s deeply integrated into JetBrains development environments (IDEs), code editors, and other products," the software development tool maker, based in the Czech Republic, said at the time.</p>
<p>While neural-network-powered services have been widely hyped, they come with baggage – concerns about the security, legal risk, privacy, and ethics of large language models remain largely unresolved.</p>

    

<p>Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI have opted to offer indemnify customers under certain conditions to reassure those worried about potential legal claims arising from generative AI.</p>

        


        

<p>But not every outfit offering AI services can make this bet and in some cases <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/12/21/artificial_intelligence_is_a_liability/">there's a cost</a>. For example, Zoom last August had to clarify that it would not use people's chats and calls for AI training despite <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/08/08/zoom_ai_legalese_update/">a change</a> to its terms of service that allowed that.</p>
<p>Some JetBrains customers feel strongly about AI Assistant and really don't want the plugin to be present in their JetBrains applications at all, whether that's due to corporate policies that are incompatible with AI Assistant or other concerns. But because the plugin code has been "deeply integrated," removal has proven complicated.</p>

        

<p>More than dozen threads on JetBrains' YouTrack issue board have been posted seeking a way to delete, uninstall, or otherwise excise the AI Assistant plugin since it debuted.</p>
<p>A <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/LLM-1760/Can-not-remove-Jetbrains-AI-Assistant-plugin-completely">thread</a> titled "Provide the possibility to remove a plugin completely from the system" makes the case for why one might not wish to have this plugin baked into the company's developer tools, such as the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/ai-assistant.html">PyCharm</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/ai-assistant.html">IntelliJ IDEA</a>, and <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/rider/AI_Assistant.html">other</a> applications.</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/01/27/ai_coding_automatic/">If you use AI to teach you how to code, remember you still need to think for yourself</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/12/21/ai_assistants_bad_code/">Study finds AI assistants help developers produce code that's more likely to be buggy</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/09/05/gitlab_ai_coding/">AI coding is 'inescapable' and here to stay, says GitLab</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/01/26/kettle_tech_failures/">Technology truly is the gift that keeps on giving ... SNAFUs to highlight</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Software developers posting to the support forum raise a number of concerns, calling the plugin "<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/LLM-1760/Can-not-remove-Jetbrains-AI-Assistant-plugin-completely#focus=Comments-27-8775047.0-0">bloatware</a>," <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/LLM-1760/Can-not-remove-Jetbrains-AI-Assistant-plugin-completely#focus=Comments-27-8710484.0-0">a risk to corporate intellectual property</a>, a security issue, an annoyance, and a breach of trust.</p>
<p>"I just want to make it clear that I cannot use this product at the company I work for because security will not allow for a by-default AI implementation to be a part of the product," <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/LLM-1973/Provide-the-possibility-to-remove-a-plugin-completely-from-the-system#focus=Comments-27-8951378.0-0">wrote</a> an individual posting under the name Rusty Deaton.</p>
<p>Another developer posting under the name Marcus Grenängen <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/LLM-1760/Can-not-remove-Jetbrains-AI-Assistant-plugin-completely#focus=Comments-27-8766615.0-0">wrote</a>, "This is unacceptable. It should not bundle something by default that can send off the entire code base to God knows where. It's a real bad move JetBrains and I will not renew any subscriptions after this. It's a breach of trust that can't be undone."</p>
<h3>'Dubious'</h3>
<p>Yet another developer posting under the name Alan Burlison <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/LLM-1760/Can-not-remove-Jetbrains-AI-Assistant-plugin-completely#focus=Comments-27-8753176.0-0">opined</a>, "The fact that this service is AI based and that you don't know the provenance of the code it provides to you is a huge issue on its own, due to the dubious licensing/IP/legal situation it creates. But the biggest issue is not because it's AI, it's because it is leaking the user's company's IP to who knows where, potentially to direct competitors."</p>
<p>In a statement to <em>The Register</em>, Matt Ellis, developer advocate at JetBrains, tried to address misapprehensions and to reassure to those alarmed by AI Assistant's persistence.</p>

        

<p>"Although the AI Assistant plugin is bundled, and the plugin itself is enabled, there is no AI functionality enabled by default, and no data is sent off-machine without your consent," said Ellis, echoing similar replies posted to some of the discussion threads. "You have to log in, accept the data policies and either purchase a subscription or start a trial."</p>
<blockquote>

<p>There is no AI functionality enabled by default, and no data is sent off-machine without your consent</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Any data sent to the AI service is not used for training. We also have ML support for ranking and completion, and this is provided by on-device models and no data is sent off device."</p>
<p>Ellis said JetBrains has a lot of customers who are happy with the bundled plugin and so the biz is looking into how its AI helper can be both bundled and fully removable.</p>
<p>"The problem with removing a bundled plugin is that it can break application signatures and cause problems with updates," explained Ellis.</p>
<p>Asked what portion of JetBrains' customers have objected to AI Assistant, a spokesperson said, "We can't say for sure how well these opinions represent the position of all of our customers. We understand the strength of feeling, and we're listening to feedback from all parts of our community, including the many happy individuals and enterprises that are using the AI Assistant." ®</p>

If another company doesn't step up, this could mean the end of landlines as we know them.</p><p>"I'm not exactly a helpless 80-year-old, but I deserve to have a phone that works," said Campo Seco resident Patricia Pereira.</p><p>AT&amp;T is applying to end its obligation to service landlines in certain areas of California. The application is pending under the California Public Utilities Commission, but the end of a landline means the end of communication for some people.</p><p>"Now I have no phone and they would not reconnect my landline because they said they're out of the business," Pereira said.</p><p>Pereira has relied on her landline for 58 years. She got a cell phone for the first time last year when her landline got disconnected, but she lives in a dead zone for cell phones. CBS13 had a hard time getting in touch with her because the call kept dropping.</p>

    

<p>"I had no safety. I had nothing to call law enforcement, an ambulance, anything that was an emergency. I had no way to get out," Pereira said.</p><p>She explained that she's been without a landline for more than a year.</p><p>"I retired from the Post Office. I came up here. I could not get a new landline. They said they can't install it so I said let's transfer the landline down there to up here. It's across the street," Pereira said.</p><p>Instead, it was disconnected altogether and she's been desperately asking for it back. AT&amp;T doesn't want that obligation anymore.</p>

    
    

<p>The company said in a statement to CBS13:</p><blockquote><p>"Our application seeks approval from the CPUC to remove outdated regulations in California and to help the limited remaining landline consumers transition to modern, alternative services to replace their current outdated ones. All AT&amp;T California customers will continue to receive their traditional landline services until an alternative service becomes available by AT&amp;T or another provider."</p></blockquote><p>"Look what they did to me," Pereira said. "How many little old ladies out there has this happened to, and they didn't know how to fight it? I'm a fighter." </p><p>Pereira said that most people in her rural area use a landline and calls it the most reliable form of communication.</p><p>"I'm just a customer who wants to have communication, and they've done it for 58 years. What is the problem?" she said.</p><p>The CPUC will be holding four public hearings on the matter through March.</p>

At least the guy and his mother who came to pick it up have a side-hustle of repairing and reselling appliances. There's hope it won't end up in a landfill. He offered to sell me a 4-door Samsung. No Thanks! I'm done with over-complicated appliances. Refrigerator repair is not a skill I'm looking to hone any further.</p><span id="continue-reading"></span><h2 id="survivorship-bias">Survivorship bias</h2><p>I have a refrigerator in my garage that's a side-by-side style Kenmore (Model# 25354362402). The sticker on the inside indicates a manufacture date of <code>06-04</code>. It was bought as a scratch-and-dent model from Sears Outlet. At some point, over a decade ago, the relay on the compressor went out. The fix was cheap and easy. Later, we started having problems with the ice maker / dispenser. Instead of fixing it, we decided to get a new one and use the side-by-side as a second refrigerator in the garage. Since then, it's out-lived two French-door refrigerators we have had in the intervening time.</p><h2 id="the-french-door-woes-begin">The French-door woes begin</h2><p>For the replacement, we went with a French-door style Kenmore (Model# 79572053110) because, you know, all that space in the fridge, and again scratch / dent sale.</p><p>I don't even remember all the problems we had with it, and this was before I started keeping better records. I have the notes from the last repair receipt:</p><blockquote><p>cked unit ice build up around ice fan motor fines removed heater good no problem found.</p></blockquote><p>After about the second repair of the same issue, I was surprised they let me buy an extended warranty on it. Fast-forward past 6-10 (I forget) repairs / replacements of the same part and much hassle, they gave me store credit as though I bought it new without dents. The amount, I forget, but ended up being a curse because we felt compelled to use it all on an even fancier French-door refrigerator this time brand new.</p><p>I wish I could go back in time and slap myself in the face for deciding to buy another French-door refrigerator. I even remember thinking about the <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle">KISS principle</a> at the time, but somehow thought switching brands and spending 3x the amount would save us from the complexity.</p><h2 id="enter-the-ge-cafe">Enter the GE Café</h2><p>This refrigerator (model# CFE28TSHESS) sports all these <em>wonderful</em> features:</p><ul><li>touch screen LCD</li><li>ice, water, and hot water dispenser</li><li>RFID chipped water filters to lock-in customers to buy their $50 filters</li></ul><p>I keep notes and <code>TODO</code> tasks using <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://orgmode.org/">org-mode</a>, and I was just gathering my notes on this refrigerator and found I have written ~1300 words on it, not counting this blog post. The following is a summary.</p><p>The first annoyance was having to employ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ellbAY9IvgU" rel="nofollow noreferrer">a hack</a> to get around GE water filter lock-in.</p><p>I've had the evaporator fan fail on me twice. Once in 2020 and its replacement failed in 2022. When that happens, the fridge compartment doesn't cool well. A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeG4CVkAFgs&amp;t=58s" rel="nofollow noreferrer">video on how to replace it</a> for context.</p><p>Ice builds up in the bottom of the freezer if the drain to the evaporation pan gets clogged. Cleaning the rubber hose and dust off the condenser is a yearly chore at least. It becomes the reason to take all the food out and fully clean everything. Otherwise, get ready to spend hours defrosting. One hack we found to speed it up was to pour nearly boiling water down the drain to defrost the ice build up.</p><p>Once the freezer stopped cooling, and we noticed the case was hot to the touch on the side between the freezer and fridge compartments. This ended up being due to a failed condenser fan. A real PITA to replace, by-the-way.</p><p>Around that time I found the technical service manual online and realized one can view error codes and run all sorts of tests via the LCD touch screen. Then I found out that the touch screen wasn't working. Since a new touch screen LCD assembly is over $300, so I ordered one off ebay instead.</p><p>We had a problem with the "new" LCD assembly intermittently pressing the hot water button on its own. Basically, the person I got the part from on ebay lied saying that it was brand new. It was refurbished. We could tell because there had been some soldering work done to the board. Instead of uninstalling it and returning it, we realized that button pressing over and over wasn't affecting any functionality (we don't use its hot water dispenser anyway). We just turned the sound off to stop the annoying repeated chiming noise.</p><p>From running fan tests in service mode, I could tell the odor remover fan also died, but I never cared to replace it. Fans are expensive!</p><p>Recently, it stopped working again. With the power of YouTube and a multi-meter I was able to test the capacitor on the relay was good, but the relay was bad. Replaced the relay, but the compressor still is not starting. Tested that it is getting 120VAC.</p><p>Here's my notes from my before replacing the relay:</p><pre><code><span>- Note taken on [2023-12-05 Tue 20:09] \\
</span><span>  WR07X10131 it was the relay that plugs into the compressor. It rattles when

<article id="post-656" class="page">
  

  <div>
    <p>In order to be able to choose their own browser, people must be free to download it, easily set it to default and to continue using it – all without interference from the operating system. Windows users do not currently enjoy this freedom of choice.</p>
<p>To investigate Microsoft’s tactics and the impact on consumers, Mozilla commissioned Harry Brignull and Cennydd Bowles, independent researchers and experts in harmful design. Today, the researchers have published a report detailing how Microsoft prevents effective browser choice on Windows. In the report, they document how Microsoft places its own browser — Edge — at the center of its operating system and weaponizes Windows’ user interface design to undermine people selecting rival browsers.</p>
<p>In some cases, the use of harmful design tactics is contrary to Microsoft’s own design guidelines. In many cases, it can lead to (and exacerbate) consumer harm and undermine competition from rival browsers. This kind of behavior is particularly concerning for an independent browser like Firefox, which is reliant on the operating systems provided by companies who are also rival browser vendors.</p>
<p>Self-preferencing from operating system/browser providers is an area Mozilla has previously highlighted, for example, in the <a href="https://research.mozilla.org/browser-competition/5wg/">Five Walled Gardens report</a>. Recently, details of many issues Mozilla experiences competing on major operating systems were published on the <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/netpolicy/2024/01/19/platform-tilt/">Platform Tilt dashboard</a>.</p>
<p>Now, with the implementation of the Digital Markets Act in the European Union marking the start of a wave of global competition regulation, we hoped that the barriers to browser competition would be dismantled. However, even where there is movement in the right direction, improvements have been incomplete and are grudgingly offered only in markets where regulators have forced platform owners to make changes to respect browser choice. For example, Apple’s decision to allow alternative browser engines is only effective in the EU.</p>
<p>Similarly, Microsoft recently <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/eupolicy/2023/11/22/windows-updates-comply-dma-edge/">pledged</a> to stop some of the actions it takes to force Edge on users who have selected other browsers. Unfortunately, these changes only address a small number of the tactics outlined in this report. And, to make matters worse, they will only be deployed to users in the EEA.</p>
<p>Windows users everywhere, especially in the rest of the world, continue to have their choices inhibited, overridden and undermined by Microsoft’s use of harmful design. Regulatory action around the world is needed to restore browser choice and competition across all of the major platforms.</p>

<p>Designer News, once a daily destination for product designers, is dead. For many years, it was the best place on the internet to discuss designing and building software.</p>



<p>The community was recently sold to a job board called WeWorkRemotely. Since then, there has been a modal that states Designer News will no longer be supported. Today appears to be the day that it finally shuts down.</p>

As you can see there was some quality front page content in it’s last hours—links to crypto posts on Pinterest and spam about sports betting apps.</figcaption></figure>



<p>What made Designer News unique was its focus on text-based discussions. In the design world, almost all online communities are dominated by aesthetics—think Dribbble or Behance. Designer News offered a space to delve into the more nuanced aspects of product design—discussions on functionality, implementation, accessibility, and team building. These types of discussions were completely absent in the more visually-oriented forums.</p>



<p>I was an early member of Designer News—number 484. For several years, I was a top contributor and was even invited to host the community podcast, <a href="https://solomon.io/tag/dn-fm/" data-type="link" data-id="https://solomon.io/tag/dn-fm/">DN FM</a>. The first few years, from 2013 to 2016, were filled with quality discussions with incredibly knowledgeable people. I’m grateful to those early members who taught me a ton.</p>



<p>Looking back, the early years were so good. DN’s invite-only policy kept discussion and post quality high. The site was available for everyone to see, but an invitation from another member was required to contribute. This made moderation easy.</p>



<p>At some point—I think around 2016—the site was set to open registration, allowing anyone to join and contribute. That’s fine, but an open community requires additional features to assist with moderation and moderators to do it. At that point, Designer News had neither. The following year, post quality started to decline, and by 2018, the site was mostly filled with spam.</p>



<p>Community moderator Catalin Cimpanu summed up the general sentiment in a 2020 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230331094219/http://www.designernews.co/stories/104981-designernews-is-almost-dead" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discussion about Designer News</a>.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>While this was a gated community, this place was just awesome. Now… listicles, how-to’s, ugly Dribbble shots, “trends” posts, endless UX hot takes, and run-of-the-mill “show site” submissions are the norm.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Designer News was created by a company called Layervault, which had built a version control system for design files—essentially, Git for designers. At a time when design and engineering were coming closer together, the product made a lot of sense. </p>



<p>They were the ones that coined the term “flat design” with their post <a href="https://layervault.tumblr.com/post/32267022219/flat-interface-design" data-type="link" data-id="https://layervault.tumblr.com/post/32267022219/flat-interface-design" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Flat Design Era</a>. The team viewed the move away from skeumorphism as a more honest approach to design. I had the privilege to interview LayerVault’s co-founder and CEO, <a href="https://solomon.io/kelly-sutton-creator-of-designer-news-ceo-of-layervault/" data-type="post" data-id="4535">Kelly Sutton</a>, back in 2014. Unfortunately, the business couldn’t establish a solid foundation and ceased operations in 2015.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.metalab.com/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.metalab.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metalab</a> (or maybe <a href="https://www.tiny.com/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.tiny.com/">Tiny</a>?) acquired Designer News that year. For a while, they were good stewards of the community, investing resources and organizing events for community members.</p>



<p>At one of those events in Atlanta, I had the opportunity to spend time with Max, one of the community organizers. Max was familiar with my interviews and asked if I’d be interested in hosting the Designer News podcast—what would become DN FM. Unlike with <a href="https://solomon.io/tag/signal-tower/" data-type="link" data-id="https://solomon.io/tag/signal-tower/">Signal Tower</a>, I had a producer and someone scheduling guests. I just had to show up and have a chat—well, that and put in hours of research. But it was a pretty good gig while it lasted.</p>



<p>Anyways, I’m not sure if anyone cares. I haven’t seen other posts about it. There’s no goodbye page. It’s kind of sad—so I felt compelled to write something.</p>



<p>The truth is Designer News is dead and has been dead for a long time. First, contributors like myself contributed less and less, then the regulars started visiting less frequently. Slowly, and then all of a sudden, the community turned into a ghost town.</p>



<p>If you’re a product designer or were a regular on Designer News, where do you have product discussions online? I’d love to find a replacement.</p>

</p><p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series">Time-series</a> forecasting is ubiquitous in various domains, such as retail, finance, manufacturing, healthcare and natural sciences. In retail use cases, for example, it has been observed that <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/artificial-intelligence/notes-from-the-ai-frontier-applications-and-value-of-deep-learning">improving demand forecasting accuracy</a> can meaningfully reduce inventory costs and increase revenue. Deep learning (DL) models have emerged as a popular approach for forecasting rich, multivariate, time-series data because they have proven to perform well in a variety of settings (e.g., DL models dominated the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169207021001874">M5 competition leaderboard</a>).
</p>
<p>
At the same time, there has been rapid progress in large foundation language models used for natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_translation">translation</a>, <a href="https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2023/09/retrieval-augmented-generation-rag-in-ai/">retrieval-augmented generation</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_code_completion">code completion</a>. These models are trained on massive amounts of <em>textual </em>data derived from a variety of sources like <a href="https://commoncrawl.org/">common crawl</a> and open-source code that allows them to identify patterns in languages. This makes them very powerful <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-shot_learning">zero-shot</a> tools; for instance, <a href="https://blog.google/products/bard/google-bard-try-gemini-ai/">when paired with retrieval</a>, they can answer questions about and summarize current events.
</p>

<p>
Despite DL-based forecasters largely <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04110">outperforming</a> traditional methods and progress being made in <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/vertex-ai-forecasting">reducing training and inference costs</a>, they face challenges: most DL architectures require <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/vertex-ai-forecasting">long and involved training and validation cycles</a> before a customer can test the model on a new time-series. A foundation model for time-series forecasting, in contrast, can provide decent out-of-the-box forecasts on unseen time-series data with no additional training, enabling users to focus on refining forecasts for the actual downstream task like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_demand_planning">retail demand planning</a>.
</p>

<p>
To that end, in “<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.10688.pdf">A decoder-only foundation model for time-series forecasting</a>”, we introduce TimesFM, a single forecasting model pre-trained on a large time-series corpus of 100 billion real world time-points. Compared to the latest large language models (LLMs), TimesFM is much smaller (200M parameters), yet we show that even at such scales, its zero-shot performance on a variety of unseen datasets of different domains and temporal granularities come close to the state-of-the-art supervised approaches trained explicitly on these datasets. Later this year we plan to make this model available for external customers in <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/tabular-data/forecasting/train-model#aiplatform_create_training_pipeline_tabular_forecasting_sample-python">Google Cloud Vertex AI</a>.
</p>


<h2>A decoder-only foundation model for time-series forecasting</h2>


<p>
LLMs are usually trained in a <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.10198.pdf">decoder-only</a> fashion that involves three steps. First, text is broken down into subwords called tokens. Then, the tokens are fed into stacked causal <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762">transformer</a> layers that produce an output corresponding to each input token (it cannot attend to future tokens). Finally, the output corresponding to the <em>i</em>-th token summarizes all the information from previous tokens and predicts the (<em>i</em>+1)-th token. During inference, the LLM generates the output one token at a time. For example, when prompted with “What is the capital of France?”, it might generate the token “The”, then condition on “What is the capital of France? The” to generate the next token “capital” and so on until it generates the complete answer: “The capital of France is Paris”.
</p>

<p>
A foundation model for time-series forecasting should adapt to variable context (what we observe) and horizon (what we query the model to forecast) lengths, while having enough capacity to encode all patterns from a large pretraining dataset. Similar to LLMs, we use stacked transformer layers (self-attention and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedforward_neural_network">feedforward</a> layers) as the main building blocks for the TimesFM model. In the context of time-series forecasting, we treat a patch (a group of contiguous time-points) as a token that was popularized by a recent <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14730">long-horizon forecasting work</a>. The task then is to forecast the (<em>i</em>+1)-th patch of time-points given the <em>i</em>-th output at the end of the stacked transformer layers. 
</p>

<p>
However, there are several key differences from language models. Firstly, we need a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilayer_perceptron">multilayer perceptron</a> block with residual connections to convert a patch of time-series into a token that can be input to the transformer layers along with <a href="https://machinelearningmastery.com/a-gentle-introduction-to-positional-encoding-in-transformer-models-part-1/">positional encodings</a> (PE). For that, we use a residual block similar to our prior work in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08424">long-horizon forecasting</a>. Secondly, at the other end, an output token from the stacked transformer can be used to predict a longer length of subsequent time-points than the input patch length, i.e., the output patch length can be larger than the input patch length.  
</p>

<p>
Consider a time-series of length 512 time-points being used to train a TimesFM model with input patch length 32 and output patch length 128. During training, the model is simultaneously trained to use the first 32 time-points to forecast the next 128 time-points, the first 64 time-points to forecast time-points 65 to 192, the first 96 time-points to forecast time-points 97 to 224 and so on. During inference, suppose the model is given a new time-series of length 256 and tasked with forecasting the next 256 time-points into the future. The model will first generate the future predictions for time-points 257 to 384, then condition on the initial 256 length input plus the generated output to generate time-points 385 to 512. On the other hand, if in our model the output patch length was equal to the input patch length of 32 then for the same task we would have to go through eight generation steps instead of just the two above. This increases the chances of more errors accumulating and therefore, in practice, we see that a longer output patch length yields better performance for long-horizon forecasting

<br>


<h2>Pretraining data</h2>


<p>
Just like LLMs get better with more tokens, TimesFM requires a large volume of legitimate time series data to learn and improve. We have spent a great amount of time creating and assessing our training datasets, and the following is what we have found works best:
</p>




<p>

    <strong>Synthetic data helps with the basics.</strong> Meaningful synthetic time-series data can be generated using statistical models or physical simulations. These basic temporal patterns can teach the model the grammar of time series forecasting.
</p>
  
<p>  
    <strong>Real-world data adds real-world flavor.</strong> We comb through available public time series datasets, and selectively put together a large corpus of 100 billion time-points. Among these datasets there are <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/">Google Trends</a> and <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Research:Page_view">Wikipedia Pageviews</a>, which track what people are interested in, and that nicely mirrors trends and patterns in many other real-world time series. This helps TimesFM understand the bigger picture and generalize better when provided with domain-specific contexts not seen during training.
</p>


<h2>Zero-shot evaluation results</h2>


<p>
We evaluate TimesFM zero-shot on data not seen during training using popular time-series benchmarks. We observe that TimesFM performs better than most statistical methods like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive_integrated_moving_average">ARIMA</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_smoothing">ETS</a> and can match or outperform powerful DL models like <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04110">DeepAR</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14730">PatchTST</a> that have been <em>explicitly trained</em> on the target time-series.
</p>

<p>
We used the <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/monash_tsf">Monash Forecasting Archive</a> to evaluate TimesFM’s out-of-the-box performance. This archive contains tens of thousands of time-series from various domains like traffic, weather, and demand forecasting covering frequencies ranging from few minutes to yearly data. Following existing literature, we inspect the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_absolute_error">mean absolute error</a> (MAE) <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07820">appropriately scaled</a> so that it can be averaged across the datasets. We see that zero-shot (ZS) TimesFM is better than most supervised approaches, including recent deep learning models. We also compare TimesFM to <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3-5">GPT-3.5</a> for forecasting using a specific prompting technique proposed by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07820">llmtime(ZS)</a>. We demonstrate that TimesFM performs better than llmtime(ZS) despite being orders of magnitude smaller.

<p>
Most of the Monash datasets are short or medium horizon, i.e., the prediction length is not too long. We also test TimesFM on popular benchmarks for long horizon forecasting against a recent state-of-the-art baseline <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14730">PatchTST</a> (and other long-horizon forecasting baselines). In the next figure, we plot the MAE on <a href="https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/ett">ETT</a> datasets for the task of predicting 96 and 192 time-points into the future. The metric has been calculated on the last test window of each dataset (as done by the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07820">llmtime</a> paper). We see that TimesFM not only surpasses the performance of llmtime(ZS) but also matches that of the supervised PatchTST model explicitly trained on the respective datasets.

<br>


<h2>Conclusion</h2>


<p>
We train a decoder-only foundation model for time-series forecasting using a large pretraining corpus of 100B real world time-points, the majority of which was search interest time-series data derived from Google Trends and pageviews from Wikipedia. We show that even a relatively small 200M parameter pretrained model that uses our TimesFM architecture displays impressive zero-shot performance on a variety of public benchmarks from different domains and granularities.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main">

					<h3>February 02, 2024</h3>
					<p>I saw a <a href="https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@Ronflaix/111862153259345050">Mastodon post</a> that made me laugh this morning. It seemed sort of crazy that the <code>html</code> element <a href="https://caniuse.com/mdn-html_elements_html">wouldn’t have 100% support</a> on CanIUse.com. Heck, I’ve been using it since 1994 and it worked just fine back then! This led me down a bit of a rabbit hole.</p>

<p>A bit of background, first. <a href="https://caniuse.com/">Can I Use…</a> is a site that helps web developers track the adoption rate of web technologies. It estimates browser usage, measures feature compatibility, and spits out a number that tries to reflect how available a feature is. It’s a site I’ve been using almost since <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100430032738/http://caniuse.com/">it launched in 2010</a> and I’ve always found it really useful.</p>

<p>So why is it currently saying the <code>html</code> element only has 97.34% support? That’s less than the current support percentage for the <a href="https://caniuse.com/audio"><code>audio</code> element</a>! It also looks like the same is true for the <a href="https://caniuse.com/mdn-html_elements_a"><code>a</code></a> and <a href="https://caniuse.com/mdn-html_elements_p"><code>p</code></a> elements with exactly the same 97.34% support number.</p>

<p>One thing I learned when looking into this is that a lot of the data on the site actually comes from <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">MDN</a> <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. MDN is another resource I use and trust, so this seems reasonable to me. It also often has stats about feature uptake, so it makes sense for CanIUse.com to piggyback on that.</p>

<p>Looking at the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/html">MDN page for the <code>html</code> element</a>, it has a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/html#browser_compatibility">browser compatibility section</a>. In that are two rows with a lot of red Xs. The first is for the optional <code>manifest</code> attribute on the <code>html</code> element. This is deprecated and was never standardized. The second is the related “<a href="https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-secure-contexts/">secure context required</a>”, which is an <a href="https://www.w3.org/standards/types/#x2-3-editor-s-draft">Editor’s Draft</a> —&nbsp;that is, not something currently on the standardization track. I don’t know how this was previously related to the <code>html</code> element, but that use was also <a href="https://caniuse.com/mdn-html_elements_html_manifest_secure_context_required">never standardized and is deprecated</a>.</p>

<p>So, there are two features listed here that almost all browsers <em>correctly</em> do not support. But still, it doesn’t look like this is the reason for the missing 2.66%. There are some browsers that are listed as “Support Unknown”. Adding up all the current usage for these browsers comes to 1.27%. There’s also an entry for Android Browser versions 2.1–4.3 which is listed as not supporting the <code>html</code> element — which I find highly dubious — but it’s listed as having a usage share of 0%. I suppose there might be some rounding errors here that would bump the 1.27% to 2.66%? But I still find this very unclear. Also, I feel very confident that those older browsers supported the <code>html</code> element!</p>

<p>So yeah, I don’t have a great answer for this. If you do, <a href="https://mastodon.social/@gavinanderegg">please let me know</a>! I’ve always taken the numbers from CanIUse.com with a few grains of salt, but I’ll be adding a few more going forward. I still think it’s a great resource.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> <a href="https://cliff.social/@rezonant">rezonant</a> on Mastodon poked me to let me know that he posted a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39236148">comment on Hacker News</a> that has a possible explanation. The short version: if you switch to “% of all tracked” in the top right beside “usage”, and then add up the “support unknown” browser number, you get 99.98%. It’s a lot easier to see how rounding errors could make this the correct number. Still, I think the way older browsers are handled here is confusing. It doesn’t affect the overall number too much, but in the case of base level elements like <code>html</code>, it seems odd.</p>

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return-oriented_programming">
Return-oriented programming</a> (ROP) attacks are hard to defend against.
Partial mitigations such as address-space layout randomization, stack
canaries, and other techniques are commonly deployed to try and frustrate
ROP attacks. Now, OpenBSD is experimenting with a new
mitigation that makes it harder for attackers to make system
calls, although some security researchers have expressed doubt that it will
prove effective at stopping real-world attacks.
In his
announcement message, Theo de Raadt said that this work
"<q>makes some specific low-level attack
methods unfeasable on OpenBSD, which will force the use of other methods.</q>"
</p>

<p>
Return-oriented programming is one of a family of techniques that use
indirect jumps to call
bits of code that already exist in a process's address space in an
attacker-controlled order. The original attack involved overwriting the stack
with carefully chosen addresses so that a function would "return" to a new
location. Since the original discovery, other related attacks that use jumps
through function pointers, signals, and other indirect jumps have been developed.
</p>

<p>
In December, De Raadt sent a <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/959664/">patch</a> to the
OpenBSD mailing list expanding OpenBSD's restrictions on the locations from
which a process can make system calls.
<a href="https://github.com/openbsd/src/commit/83762a71f74848f4d09174ce350838b4204957c5">
A previous commit</a> added code that declares a new ELF section which
specifies where particular system calls are located within a program, so that the
kernel can detect when a program tries to call a system call from the wrong
location. Since OpenBSD does not have a stable system-call interface (instead
suggesting that programs go through the C library for a stable interface), the
new sections will not need to be explicitly added to most binary programs.
Now that patch has <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/959883/">been merged</a>,
finishing a process which De Raadt said has taken five years.
</p>

<h4>Background</h4>

<p>
OpenBSD <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/806776/">already restricted</a> where programs can make
system calls. In 2019, De Raadt added code to ensure that system calls could only be
made from four locations: in the text of a static binary (that links the C
library statically, and so doesn't have a separate section at runtime), in the
signal trampoline (where a system call is required to return from a signal
handler), in the text of <tt>ld.so</tt> (the dynamic linker, that needs to make
system calls to set up the process's address space), and in the text of
<tt>libc.so</tt> (where the OpenBSD system call stubs live).
</p>

<p>
This code relied on a new
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/msyscall"><tt>msyscall()</tt></a>
system call to let the linker inform the
kernel of where <tt>libc.so</tt>
(the shared object for the system's C library)
is mapped within the address space. In February
2023, De Raadt <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/959668/">extended</a> these protections with the
introduction of
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-7.4/pinsyscall"><tt>pinsyscall()</tt></a>,
which is used to say where in the binary
a process is allowed to call
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/execve.2"><tt>execve()</tt></a>. Both of these
system calls can only be invoked once by a given process, which is done by the
dynamic linker.
</p>

<pre>    int msyscall(void *addr, size_t len);
    int pinsyscall(int syscall, void *start, size_t len);
</pre>

<p>
Despite its more generic signature, <tt>pinsyscall()</tt> only supports
specifying a location for <tt>execve()</tt> calls.
</p>

<p>
These mechanisms were also intended to make it harder for ROP
attacks to gain a foothold. Requiring the address from which a system
call is made to be within the <tt>msyscall()</tt> block ensures that an
attack cannot make use of any ROP gadgets ending in a system call that may be
present outside of the specially designated areas.
Requiring that <tt>execve()</tt> calls come from one
specific location is also intended to make it harder for an attack to figure out
where to make a call from, since calling <tt>execve()</tt> to execute an
attacker-controlled program is a common stepping stone in an attack.
</p>
<p>
The new work obsoletes both of
these mechanisms, with De Raadt <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/959666">suggesting</a> that
once the new code had been adopted for a release or two, they could
"<q>turn msyscall() and the less powerful pinsyscall(2) into NOPs, and
eventually remove them</q>".
</p>

<h4>The patch</h4>

<p>
The new work adds a new
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pinsyscalls.2"><tt>pinsyscalls()</tt></a>
system call:
</p>

<pre>    int pinsyscalls(void *start, size_t len, u_int *pintable, int npins);
</pre>

<p>
<tt>pinsyscalls()</tt> sends a "pintable" specifying from where in the process's
address space each possible system call is expected to be made.
The kernel uses the information in the table to check on entry
to the kernel whether it is being invoked from a specified location. This check
is intended to prevent a ROP attack from setting the system call number and then
jumping directly to a system-call CPU instruction corresponding to a different
system call. For example, an attack wishing to make an <tt>execve()</tt> call
would need to jump to the specific instruction in the C library that has been
added to the allowlist for that call, not another stub or
the middle of an unrelated instruction which simply happens to decode as a
system call instruction.
</p>

<p>
When setting up a new process, the dynamic linker uses <tt>pinsyscalls()</tt> to
inform the kernel about from where the process expects to make system calls.
The new work adds an "openbsd.syscalls" ELF section to
select programs: <tt>ld.so</tt>,
<tt>libc.so</tt>, and <tt>libc.a</tt>.
The new ELF section
contains an array of program offsets and system call numbers, indicating which
system call is expected at each location. This section is read by the dynamic
linker and used to provide a suitable pintable to the kernel.
Programs that link against the C library
can therefore benefit from the new protection immediately, without requiring
changes to their build process. Unlike Linux, OpenBSD
develops the kernel and user-space together, so the user-space components of this
work are already in place.
</p>

<p>
Security researchers have expressed doubt about how useful this check is at preventing
compromises. One researcher, "stein",
<a href="https://isopenbsdsecu.re/mitigations/pinsyscall/">
noted</a> that "<q>an attacker able to perform ROP can simply use the libc stub,
instead of issuing raw syscalls</q>", referring to the possibility of an attack
jumping directly to the instruction which has been added to the allowlist for a particular system call.
Another researcher, Saagar Jha, <a href="https://federated.saagarjha.com/notice/AcmzyfPcwc8KDVlOqm">
commented</a> on the new patch, saying
"<q>if you take this to its logical conclusion it's just 'applications should
specify which system calls they use' which is literally just what pledge does
and it’s enforced by the kernel and not in some weird ad-hoc IP to syscall
number lookup scheme</q>".
</p>

<p>
OpenBSD does have existing mitigations designed to make it difficult for ROP
attacks to determine the location of the C library system call stubs. One such
protection is
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_space_layout_randomization">
address-space layout randomization</a> (ASLR), which has been standard
in many operating systems for a long time. OpenBSD takes randomization of a
program's address space a step farther by also re-linking the sections of the C
library in a random order on boot, meaning that an attack must determine not
only the offset of the C library in memory, but also the offset of the specific
code to which the attack wishes to jump within the library.
Unfortunately, dynamically linked programs have to have this information in the
symbol relocation table in order to allow for calls to the shared object.
Therefore attacks that can construct a way to read memory can frequently leak
enough offset information to circumvent these protections. De Raadt gave
<a href="https://twitter.com/i/broadcasts/1kvJpmkYkaZxE">a talk</a>
(with <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/papers/csw2023.pdf">slides</a>)
about ROP mitigations in OpenBSD at CanSecWest in 2023, including several other
protections designed to make leaking information about the contents of a program
harder.
</p>

<p>
Unlike <tt>pledge()</tt>, this patch has the advantage of securing an application even if
the developer does not make any special effort. However, this protection is most
useful to programs that statically link OpenBSD's C library; programs that use
dynamic linking will still have all of the system calls used by the C library in
their address space. <tt>pledge()</tt> also permits dropping unnecessary permissions after
startup, which allows applications to use a more restrictive set of permissions
than a static defense like <tt>pinsyscalls()</tt> can permit.
</p>

<p>
This work was difficult to bring to completion. One of the largest obstacles
were programs written in Go. In his announcement that the new work had been
merged, De Raadt said: "<q>The direct-syscalls-inside-the-binary model used by
go (and only go, noone
else in the history of the unix software does this) provided the biggest
resistance against this effort</q>". He thanked Joel Sing specifically for his
work to make the Go ecosystem compatible with the changes.
</p>

<p>
Since Linux permits programs to make system calls directly, without going
through a wrapper from a blessed C library, and is unlikely to change this
policy, additional steps would be needed to incorporate a similar mechanism
there. Some Linux programs make system calls directly in order to avoid
depending on a specific C library, but others make system calls directly in
order to use new features which have not yet been wrapped by the system's C
library; OpenBSD doesn't have this problem since its C library and kernel are
developed in lockstep.
</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p>
OpenBSD has a long history of adding novel mitigations, some of which are
adopted by other projects and some of which are not. This work seems unlikely to
be adopted elsewhere, given the doubts around the practical benefit and the
costs of adding additional complexity to how system calls are performed.
This work does add another barrier to constructing a ROP
attack on OpenBSD, however, and seems especially beneficial for
statically linked programs that use only a few system calls and have not yet made
use of pledge.
