          <p>We’re Fly.io and we transmute containers into VMs, running them on our hardware around the world with the power of Firecracker alchemy. We do a lot of stuff with WireGuard, which has become a part of our customer API. This is a quick story about some tricks we played to make WireGuard faster and more scalable for the hundreds of thousands of people who now use it here.</p>
<p>One of many odd decisions we’ve made at Fly.io is how we use WireGuard. It’s not just that we use it in many places where other shops would use HTTPS and REST APIs. We’ve gone a step beyond that: every time you run <code>flyctl</code>, our lovable, sprawling CLI, it conjures a TCP/IP stack out of thin air, with its own IPv6 address, and speaks directly to Fly Machines running on our networks.</p>

<p>There are plusses and minuses to this approach, which we talked about <a href="https://fly.io/blog/our-user-mode-wireguard-year/" title="">in a blog post a couple years back</a>. Some things, like remote-operated Docker builders, get easier to express (a Fly Machine, as far as <code>flyctl</code> is concerned, might as well be on the same LAN). But everything generally gets trickier to keep running reliably.</p>

<p>It was a decision. We own it.</p>

<p>Anyways, we’ve made some improvements recently, and I’d like to talk about them.</p>
<h2 id="where-we-left-off"><a href="#where-we-left-off" aria-label="Anchor"></a>Where we left off</h2>
<p>Until a few weeks ago, our gateways ran on a pretty simple system.</p>

<ol>
<li>We operate dozens of “gateway” servers around the world, whose sole purpose is to accept incoming WireGuard connections and connect them to the appropriate private networks.
</li><li>Any time you run <code>flyctl</code> and it needs to talk to a Fly Machine (to build a container, pop an SSH console, copy files, or proxy to a service you’re running), it spawns or connects to a background agent process.
</li><li>The first time it runs, the agent generates a new WireGuard peer configuration from our GraphQL API. WireGuard peer configurations are very simple: just a public key and an address to connect to.
</li><li>Our API in turn takes that peer configuration and sends it to the appropriate gateway (say, <code>ord</code>, if you’re near Chicago) via an RPC we send over the NATS messaging system.
</li><li>On the gateway, a service called <code>wggwd</code> accepts that configuration, saves it to a SQLite database, and adds it to the kernel using WireGuard’s Golang libraries. <code>wggwd</code> acknowledges the installation of the peer to the API.
</li><li>The API replies to your GraphQL request, with the configuration.
</li><li>Your <code>flyctl</code> connects to the WireGuard peer, which works, because you receiving the configuration means it’s installed on the gateway.
</li></ol>

<p>I copy-pasted those last two bullet points from <a href="https://fly.io/blog/our-user-mode-wireguard-year/" title="">that two-year-old post</a>, because when it works, it does <em>just work</em> reasonably well. (We ultimately did end up defaulting everybody to WireGuard-over-WebSockets, though.)</p>

<p>But if it always worked, we wouldn’t be here, would we?</p>

<p>We ran into two annoying problems:</p>

<p>One: NATS is fast, but doesn’t guarantee delivery. Back in 2022, Fly.io was pretty big on NATS internally. We’ve moved away from it. For instance, our <a href="https://fly.io/blog/carving-the-scheduler-out-of-our-orchestrator/" title="">internal <code>flyd</code> API</a> used to be driven by NATS; today, it’s HTTP.  Our NATS cluster was losing too many messages to host a reliable API on it. Scaling back our use of NATS made WireGuard gateways better, but still not great.</p>

<p>Two: When <code>flyctl</code> exits, the WireGuard peer it created sticks around on the gateway. Nothing cleans up old peers. After all, you’re likely going to come back tomorrow and deploy a new version of your app, or <code>fly ssh console</code> into it to debug something. Why remove a peer just to re-add it the next day? </p>

<p>Unfortunately, the vast majority of peers are created by <code>flyctl</code> in CI jobs, which don’t have persistent storage and can’t reconnect to the same peer the next run; they generate new peers every time, no matter what.</p>

<p>So, we ended up with a not-reliable-enough provisioning system, and gateways with hundreds of thousands of peers that will never be used again. The high stale peer count made kernel WireGuard operations very slow - especially loading all the peers back into the kernel after a gateway server reboot - as well as some kernel panics.</p>

<p>There had to be</p>
<h2 id="a-better-way"><a href="#a-better-way" aria-label="Anchor"></a>A better way.</h2>
<p>Storing bajillions of WireGuard peers is no big challenge for any serious n-tier RDBMS. This isn’t “big data”. The problem we have at Fly.io is that our gateways don’t have serious n-tier RDBMSs. They’re small. Scrappy. They live off the land.</p>

<p>Seriously, though: you could store every WireGuard peer everybody has ever used at Fly.io in a single SQLite database, easily.  What you can’t do is store them all in the Linux kernel.</p>

<p>So, at some point, as you push more and more peer configurations to a gateway, you have to start making decisions about which peers you’ll enable in the kernel, and which you won’t.</p>

<p>Wouldn’t it be nice if we just didn’t have this problem? What if, instead of pushing configs to gateways, we had the gateways pull them from our API on demand?</p>

<p>If you did that, peers would only have to be added to the kernel when the client wanted to connect. You could yeet them out of the kernel any time you wanted; the next time the client connected, they’d just get pulled again, and everything would work fine.</p>

<p>The problem you quickly run into to build this design is that Linux kernel WireGuard doesn’t have a feature for installing peers on demand. However:</p>
<h2 id="it-is-possible-to-jit-wireguard-peers"><a href="#it-is-possible-to-jit-wireguard-peers" aria-label="Anchor"></a>It is possible to JIT WireGuard peers</h2>
<p>The Linux kernel’s <a href="https://github.com/WireGuard/wgctrl-go" title="">interface for configuring WireGuard</a> is <a href="https://docs.kernel.org/userspace-api/netlink/intro.html" title="">Netlink</a> (which is basically a way to create a userland socket to talk to a kernel service). Here’s a <a href="https://github.com/WireGuard/wg-dynamic/blob/master/netlink.h" title="">summary of it as a C API</a>. Note that there’s no API call to subscribe for “incoming connection attempt” events.</p>

<p>That’s OK! We can just make our own events. WireGuard connection requests are packets, and they’re easily identifiable, so we can efficiently snatch them with a BPF filter and a <a href="https://github.com/google/gopacket" title="">packet socket</a>.</p>
<p>Most of the time, it’s even easier for us to get the raw WireGuard packets, because our users now default to WebSockets WireGuard (which is just an unauthenticated WebSockets connect that shuttles framed UDP packets to and from an interface on the gateway), so that people who have trouble talking end-to-end in UDP can bring connections up.</p>
<p>We own the daemon code for that, and can just hook the packet receive function to snarf WireGuard packets.</p>

<p>It’s not obvious, but WireGuard doesn’t have notions of “client” or “server”. It’s a pure point-to-point protocol; peers connect to each other when they have traffic to send. The first peer to connect is called the <strong>initiator</strong>, and the peer it connects to is the <strong>responder</strong>.</p>

<p>For Fly.io, <code>flyctl</code> is typically our initiator,  sending a single UDP packet to the gateway, which is the responder. According <a href="https://www.wireguard.com/papers/wireguard.pdf" title="">to the WireGuard paper</a>, this first packet is a <code>handshake initiation</code>.  It gets better: the packet type is recorded in a single plaintext byte. So this simple BPF filter catches all the incoming connections: <code>udp and dst port 51820 and udp[8] = 1</code>.</p>

<p>In most other protocols, we’d be done at this point; we’d just scrape the username or whatnot out of the packet, go fetch the matching configuration, and install it in the kernel. With WireGuard, not so fast. WireGuard is based on Trevor Perrin’s <a href="http://www.noiseprotocol.org/" title="">Noise Protocol Framework</a>, and Noise goes way out of its way to <a href="http://www.noiseprotocol.org/noise.html#identity-hiding" title="">hide identities</a> during handshakes. To identify incoming requests, we’ll need to run enough Noise cryptography to decrypt the identity.</p>

<p>The code to do this is fussy, but it’s relatively short (about 200 lines). Helpfully, the kernel Netlink interface will give a privileged process the private key for an interface, so the secrets we need to unwrap WireGuard are easy to get. Then it’s just a matter of running the first bit of the Noise handshake. If you’re that kind of nerdy, <a href="https://gist.github.com/tqbf/9f2c2852e976e6566f962d9bca83062b" title="">here’s the code.</a></p>

<p>At this point, we have the event feed we wanted: the public keys of every user trying to making a WireGuard connection to our gateways. We keep a rate-limited cache in SQLite, and when we see new peers, we’ll make an internal HTTP API request to fetch the matching peer information and install it. This fits nicely into the little daemon that already runs on our gateways to manage WireGuard, and allows us to ruthlessly and recklessly remove stale peers with a <code>cron</code> job.</p>

<p>But wait! There’s more! We bounced this plan off Jason Donenfeld, and he tipped us off on a sneaky feature of the Linux WireGuard Netlink interface.</p>
<p>Jason is the hardest working person in show business.</p>
<p>Our API fetch for new peers is generally not going to be fast enough to respond to the first handshake initiation message a new client sends us. That’s OK; WireGuard is pretty fast about retrying. But we can do better.</p>

<p>When we get an incoming initiation message, we have the 4-tuple address of the desired connection, including the ephemeral source port <code>flyctl</code> is using. We can install the peer as if we’re the initiator, and <code>flyctl</code> is the responder. The Linux kernel will initiate a WireGuard connection back to <code>flyctl</code>. This works; the protocol doesn’t care a whole lot who’s the server and who’s the client. We get new connections established about as fast as they can possibly be installed.</p>

<h2 id="look-at-this-graph"><a href="#look-at-this-graph" aria-label="Anchor"></a>Look at this graph</h2>
<p>We’ve been running this in production for a few weeks and we’re feeling pretty happy about it. We went from thousands, or hundreds of thousands, of stale WireGuard peers on a gateway to what rounds to none. Gateways now hold a lot less state, are faster at setting up peers, and can be rebooted without having to wait for many unused peers to be loaded back into the kernel.</p>

<p>I’ll leave you with this happy Grafana chart from the day of the switchover.</p>

<p><img alt="a Grafana chart of 'kernel_stale_wg_peer_count' vs. time. For the first few hours, all traces are flat. Most are at values between 0 and 50,000 and the top-most is just under 550,000. Towards the end of the graph, each line in turn jumps sharply down to the bottom, and at the end of the chart all datapoints are indistinguishable from 0." src="https://fly.io/blog/jit-wireguard-peers/assets/wireguard-peers-graph.webp"></p>

<p><strong>Editor’s note:</strong> Despite our tearful protests, Lillian has decided to move on from Fly.io to explore new pursuits. We wish her much success and happiness!&nbsp;✨</p>

              <p>Article <a href="https://tidbits.com/2024/03/04/do-you-use-it-how-tidbits-readers-install-macos-updates/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Do You Use It? How TidBITS Readers Install macOS Updates - TidBITS</a> says that “Some people even wait until Apple announces or even releases the next macOS version, under the theory that it somehow isn’t fully baked until then.”. I wait until the next major release, but not under that theory.</p>
<p>It used to be one reason to wait was that macOS updates have become so time consuming that I’d wait until there were just the faster security updates left. But now with the sealed system volume even the security updates are a pain.</p>
<p>So that leaves my primary reason: I used to look forward to classic Mac and OS X updates. That ended with OS X Lion. I think every OS X/macOS version since Snow Leopard has been worse than the one before. So, I put off the pain of lost functionality as long as possible.</p>
<p>You think I’m joking? Just look at what we’ve lost in each upgrade since OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard:</p>
<p><strong>10.7 Lion</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Rosetta (PowerPC apps)</li>
<li>iSync</li>
<li>DVD distribution of the upgrade</li>
<li>Save As (change to “modern document model")</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>10.8 Mountain Lion</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Safari RSS</li>
<li>Display preferences menu</li>
<li>MobileMe</li>
<li>Click on Dock icon to invoke application Exposé</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>10.9 Mavericks</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Open Transport (NewsWatcher)</li>
<li>Sync Services (USB sync of contacts &amp; calendars)</li>
<li>Apple File Protocol is deprecated</li>
<li>Airport Utility</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>10.10 Yosemite</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A legible user interface</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>10.11 El Capitan</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A usable Disk Utility</li>
<li>Freedom to update /usr, such as the locate database script in /usr/libexec</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>10.12 Sierra</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Console logs</li>
<li>Audio and video chats in Messages</li>
<li>Time Remaining in the battery status menu</li>
<li>Secure delete (Trash and srm)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>10.13 High Sierra</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Offline macOS installs</li>
<li>HFS on internal SSDs</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>10.14 Mojave</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>HFS on startup drives</li>
<li>iTunes support for Apps (iTunes 12.6.5 is not supported)</li>
<li>Back To My Mac</li>
<li>Sub-pixel antialiasing (affects non-Retina displays)</li>
<li>Safari extensions not in Safari Extensions Gallery</li>
<li>1Password auto-entry of passwords</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>10.15 Catalina</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>32-bit apps</li>
<li>QuickTime 7</li>
<li>Legacy media codecs in the QuickTime 7 framework</li>
<li>iTunes
<ul>
<li>and artwork in the Songs (Column Browser) view in Music</li>
<li>and ability to hide the Sidebar in Music</li>
<li>iTunes scripts no longer work</li>
<li>iTunes Music Library.xml</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Dashboard</li>
<li>macOS on writable volume
<ul>
<li>and user files at the Macintosh HD (root) level</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mail classic view (column headings, rearrange columns, change column size)</li>
<li>FireWire startup drives</li>
<li>Safari extensions not in App Store</li>
<li>Log folders in Console</li>
<li>“Remote Disc” — accessing a shared CD/DVD drive</li>
<li>Bash as the default shell</li>
<li>Launchd daemons/agents running scripts from Documents</li>
<li>Custom icons on non-boot macOS volumes</li>
<li>Cloning macOS to a pre-encrypted volume; the only way to encrypt is to boot from it</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>11 Big Sur</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Kexts where there is a System Extension equivalent (firewall and anti-virus)</li>
<li>Hiding Date/Time in menu bar</li>
<li>Distinctive icons; they now look like iOS</li>
<li>Compact menubar icon spacing</li>
<li>Horizontally laid out dialog and alert boxes</li>
<li>Visible proxy icons</li>
<li>Classic sound effects</li>
<li>AFP file sharing</li>
<li>Network Utility app</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>12 Monterey</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Dropbox as an ordinary folder that syncs, but weirdly only on some computers</li>
<li>Speaker icon for Sound menu bar applet, now is Headphones. And it doesn’t change when muted.</li>
<li>Python (but is installed by Xcode Command Line Utilities)</li>
</ul>
<p>I hate Big Sur’s icons and vertical dialog boxes intensely.</p>

              <p>Interesting what you have posted, in general.</p>
<p>I am not challenging you, or saying you are wrong, but I would like to know how you compiled this list.</p>
<p>Also, specifically regarding -</p>

<p>If I am interpreting your notes correctly, this particular item states, starting with Mavericks macOS, the local sync (via USB) of Contacts and Calendars went away.</p>
<p>However up until my installation of Ventura, I was able to successfully perform a local sync (via USB) (of Calendars, although the Contacts syncing simply did not perform at that point).</p>
<p>When I installed Ventura, my attempt at local sync (via USB) of Calendars blew up, and basically destroyed my Calendar data.</p>
<p>It’s a long, sordid story, but at this point, I am giving up on the Apple versions of Calendar, and Contacts, and am in the process of switching to BusyCal and Busy Contacts.</p>

              <p>IIRC Craig Federighi said (maybe on the Talk Show podcast?) that Settings app was redone in SwiftUI for several reasons - one was to make it more consistent with iOS and iPadOS. Lots of people are coming to the Mac for the first time after experiencing iOS (there are many more users of iOS than MacOS for sure) and the consistent interface would be helpful. But I think another reason, and perhaps more important, was that the System Preferences set of individual panes was getting hard to manage and update - remember that they were all single pane, and couldn’t scroll, so they had to create subpages when the number of options grew too large to fit in a single window -  and Apple switched instead to SwiftUI which would, in the long run, be much easier to maintain and, Apple thinks, use.</p>
<p>Frankly I think it’s fine, and improved from the first release of Ventura. It can take me a while to find particular options, but the search box actually works pretty well. And I suppose if I was somebody who never used a Mac but had extensive experience with iOS I’d probably prefer the current layout.</p>

<p>Sync Services was dropped in Mavericks, and with it, local synching over USB.

<p>I think USB synching was supposed to have returned with OS X 10.9.3 and iTunes 11.2: <a href="https://tidbits.com/2014/05/15/local-contactcalendar-syncing-returns-in-itunes-11-2/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Local Contact/Calendar Syncing Returns in iTunes 11.2 - TidBITS</a>.

<p>My objection to Airport Utility was it was the typical Apple procedure:</p>
<ol>
<li>There’s a full-featured utility or application. (In this case, Airport Utility 5.6)</li>
<li>Apple releases a completely new version, but it is missing functionality that was in the old version.</li>
<li>Users complain.</li>
<li>Apple says: but this is just version 1! We’ll add the missing features later.</li>
<li>Time passes. Apple never adds the missing features.</li>
<li>Apple removes the ability to run the old, full featured utility.</li>
</ol>
<p>(See Airport Utility, Quicktime Player, Disk Utility…)</p>
<p>In particular, the newer Airport Utility could not fully manage the features in an Airport base station or Time Capsule. And since there’s no other way to manage an ABS or TC except through the Airport Utility, that means that they effectively removed capabilities from those devices.</p>

            <div><h2>Taxpayers encouraged to try innovative new option before April 15 deadline</h2>

<p>IR-2024-68, March 12, 2024</p>

<p>WASHINGTON — The Internal Revenue Service announced today the full-scale launch of the innovative <a data-entity-substitution="pup_linkit_media" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="ec08e586-b236-49ae-b2f6-8ad4e0f46ad7" href="https://directfile.irs.gov/" title="IRS Direct File">Direct File pilot</a> and encouraged eligible taxpayers in 12 states to try the new service to file their tax returns online for free directly with the IRS.</p>

<p>The pilot effort has been in testing mode for several weeks, allowing early users to file their 2023 federal tax returns online for free and directly with the IRS. Thousands of taxpayers have successfully used the system, and early users are giving the new option positive reviews.</p>

<p>Following the initial Direct File success, the IRS is moving the pilot out of the test phase, allowing all eligible taxpayers in the 12 states – representing 19 million taxpayers – to use the system at any time. Taxpayers can log in to <a href="https://directfile.irs.gov/">Direct File</a> to start their return and complete it any time before the April filing deadline.</p>

<p>“The early results from Direct File have shown taxpayers like the ease and convenience of the tool, and moving into the full-scale launch of the pilot will give more taxpayers the chance to use this free option,” said IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel. “Expanding Direct File as the tax deadline approaches will provide more taxpayers a way to file directly with the IRS for free, and it will give us more valuable information to assess this pilot. For those who haven’t filed their taxes in these 12 states, we encourage them to visit IRS.gov and see if Direct File is the right option for them.”</p>

<p>Direct File is one of many options that taxpayers have to file their taxes, including tax software and tax professionals. For the pilot, the IRS worked on a streamlined way for people with simpler tax situations to file directly with the agency.</p>

<p>“A team of experts from across government built and tested the Direct File pilot to give taxpayers an easy, accurate free way to file their taxes online directly with the IRS,” Werfel added. “Our goal with the Direct File pilot is to help people meet their tax obligations as easily and quickly as possible. We developed Direct File from the beginning with taxpayers’ help, and we’ll continue to talk to taxpayers about their experience to learn more about what taxpayers want for future digital services.”</p>

<p>Direct File walks the taxpayer through the complexities of the nation’s tax code to complete their filing easily with an accurate calculation of their refund or tax owed. Direct File is designed to be easy for taxpayers to use. At every step, it shows the work behind the calculations, so users can be confident that the tax return is complete and accurate. Once taxpayers start their return on the <a href="https://directfile.irs.gov/">Direct File</a> site, they can pause and then securely sign in to finish any time before the April filing deadline.</p>

<p>Users can also get support from special IRS customer service representatives through Direct File’s live chat feature. Direct File, like other electronic filing options, allows taxpayers to typically get their refund in less than 21 days when the direct deposit is chosen.</p>

<p>“We’ve gotten great initial feedback from the thousands of taxpayers who used it during testing,” Werfel said. “Many taxpayers we’ve heard from filed their taxes in less than 30 minutes using Direct File and praised it as an easy, no cost tax filing experience.”</p>

<h3>Who’s eligible?</h3>

<p>Taxpayers in 12 pilot states who meet certain requirements can use Direct File through the April tax deadline. Pilot states include:</p>

<ul><li>Arizona</li>
	<li>California</li>
	<li>Florida</li>
	<li>Massachusetts</li>
	<li>Nevada</li>
	<li>New Hampshire</li>
	<li>New York</li>
	<li>South Dakota</li>
	<li>Tennessee</li>
	<li>Texas</li>
	<li>Washington State</li>
	<li>Wyoming</li>
</ul><p>After completing their federal returns, taxpayers in the states with a state-income tax – Arizona, California, Massachusetts and New York -- will be guided to a state-sponsored tool to complete their state tax return.</p>

<p>The IRS designed the pilot to follow the best practices for launching a new technology platform by starting small, making sure it works and then building from there. The pilot is purposefully limited to cover relatively straightforward tax situations.</p>

<p>The Direct File pilot is an option for taxpayers who fall into these categories:</p>

<ul><li>Report income earned from jobs that generate a Form W-2; including taxpayers with more than one job with W-2 wages;</li>
	<li>Claim Earned Income Tax Credit, Child Tax Credit and the Credit for Other Dependents;</li>
	<li>Claim the standard deduction and deductions for educator expenses and student loan interest;</li>
	<li>Lived in the same state for the entire calendar year 2023.</li>
</ul><p>Interested taxpayers can go to <a data-entity-substitution="pup_linkit_media" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="ec08e586-b236-49ae-b2f6-8ad4e0f46ad7" href="https://directfile.irs.gov/" title="IRS Direct File">directfile.irs.gov</a>, where they can determine if they are eligible. Using Direct File requires identity verification through ID.me. Once their identity is verified and they’ve signed in securely to Direct File, they will be providing the tax information directly to the IRS, not a third party.</p>

<p>For taxpayers who visit Direct File but aren’t eligible for the pilot, they will be directed to <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="0a2fc2c3-9e78-4514-b1dc-6959b2f5e891" href="https://www.irs.gov/filing/free-file-do-your-federal-taxes-for-free" title="File your taxes for free">Free File on IRS.gov</a>. Now in its 22nd filing season, taxpayers across the nation can access free software products provided by IRS Free File trusted partners. Through this public-private partnership, tax preparation and filing software providers make their online products available to eligible taxpayers. Eight private-sector Free File partners provide online guided tax software products this year to any taxpayer with an Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) of $79,000 or less in 2023. Free access to online products is available by starting from IRS Free File.</p>

<h3>Direct File pilot for filing season 2024</h3>

<p>The IRS launched the Direct File pilot for the 2024 filing season. The Inflation Reduction Act mandated that the IRS study interest in and feasibility of creating a direct e-filing tool taxpayers could use to prepare and file their federal income tax return. The IRS commissioned an independent study, which indicated broad interest in such a system, which the IRS detailed in a <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="f743231f-73a1-418f-bb7f-5d7daa75bebf" href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-submits-direct-file-report-to-congress-treasury-department-directs-pilot-to-evaluate-key-issues" title="IRS submits Direct File report to Congress; Treasury Department directs pilot to evaluate key issues">Direct File Report to Congress</a> in May 2023.</p>

<p>Shortly after that report, as directed by the Treasury Department, the IRS assembled a team of tax experts, technologists, engineers and strategists from across government to build the Direct File system. The IRS worked closely with the U.S. Digital Service and the General Services Administration’s technology office 18F to build and test Direct File.</p>

<p>Initial testing began in early February 2024 with a handful of federal and state government employees, followed by short open availability windows for more taxpayers to start their returns. On March 4, the IRS announced that Direct File would enter final testing, which included an allotment of available spaces with more spaces added every day. Direct File is now open to all eligible taxpayers in pilot states to decide if it is the right option for them to file their 2023 federal tax return online for free, directly with IRS.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2024/2/13/24070864/samotsvety-forecasting-superforecasters-tetlock">https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2024/2/13/24070864/samotsvety-forecasting-superforecasters-tetlock</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39685894">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="dDPrPk">The question before a group made up of some of the best forecasters of world events: What are the odds that <a href="https://www.vox.com/china" data-source="encore">China</a> will control at least half of Taiwan’s territory by 2030?</p>
<p id="ZezmsO">Everyone on the chat gives their answer, and in each case it’s a number. Chinmay Ingalagavi, an economics fellow at Yale, says 8 percent. Nuño Sempere, the 25-year-old Spanish independent researcher and consultant leading our session, agrees. Greg Justice, an MBA student at the University of Chicago, pegs it at 17 percent. Lisa Murillo, who holds a PhD in <a href="https://www.vox.com/neuroscience" data-source="encore">neuroscience</a>, says 15-20 percent. One member of the group, who asked not to be named in this context because they have family in China who could be targeted by the government there, posits the highest figure: 24 percent.</p>
<p id="xaGAvy">Sempere asks me for my number. Based on a quick analysis of past military clashes between the countries, I came up with 5 percent. That might not seem too far away from the others, but it feels embarrassingly low in this context. Why am I so out of step?</p>
<p id="nFqbpL">This is a meeting of Samotsvety. The name comes from a 50-year-old Soviet rock band — more on that later — but the modern Samotsvety specializes in predicting the future. And they are very, very good at it. At <a href="https://www.infer-pub.com/">Infer</a>, a major forecasting platform <a href="https://www.infer-pub.com/the-pub/rand-program-update">operated by Rand</a>, the <a href="https://capture.dropbox.com/qENgJOuZgsTPZy3c">four most accurate forecasters in the site’s history</a> are all members of Samotsvety, and there is a wide gap between them and fifth place. In fact, the gap between them and fifth place is bigger than between fifth and 10th places. They’re waaaaay out ahead.</p>
<p id="JdyadS">While Samotsvety members converse on Slack regularly, the Saturday meetings are the heart of the group, and I was sitting in to get a sense of why, exactly, the group was so good. What were these folks doing differently that made them able to see the future when the rest of us can’t?</p>
<p id="9fJdRC">I knew a bit about forecasting going into the meeting. I’ve <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23785731/human-extinction-forecasting-superforecasters">written about it</a>; I’ve read <em>Superforecasting</em>, the bestseller by Philip Tetlock and Dan Gardner describing the research behind forecasting. The whole <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect" data-source="encore">Future Perfect</a> team here at Vox <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2024/1/1/24011179/2024-predictions-trump-politics-ohtani-oppenheimer-elections">puts together predictions</a> at the start of each year, hoping not just to lay down markers on how we think the next year will go, but to get better at forecasting in the process. </p>
<p id="Rz7hod">Part of the appeal of forecasting is not just that it seems to work, but that you don’t seem to need specialized expertise to succeed at it. The aggregated opinions of non-experts doing forecasting have <a href="https://arbresearch.com/files/comparing_forecasters.pdf">proven to be a better guide to the future</a> than the aggregated opinions of experts. One <a href="https://goodjudgment.io/docs/Goldstein-et-al-2015.pdf">frequently cited study</a> found that accurate forecasters’ predictions of geopolitical events, when aggregated using standard scientific methods, were more accurate than the forecasts of members of the US intelligence community who answered the same questions in a confidential prediction market. This was true even though the latter had access to classified intelligence.</p>
<p id="5Cxojy">But I felt a bit stuck. After years of doing my annual predictions, I didn’t sense they were improving much at all, but I wasn’t predicting enough things to tell for sure. Events kept happening that I didn’t see coming, like the <a href="https://www.vox.com/2023/10/7/23907683/israel-hamas-war-news-updates-october-2023">Gaza war</a> in recent months or the <a href="https://www.vox.com/2023/6/26/23774184/putin-wagner-group-mutiny-prigozhin">Wagner mutiny</a> a few months before that. I wanted to hang out with Samotsvety for a bit because they were the best of the best, and thus a good crew to learn from.</p>
<p id="z2FpqJ">They count among their fans Jason Matheny, now CEO of the RAND Corporation, a think tank that’s long worked on developing better predictive methods. Before he was at RAND, Matheny funded foundational work on forecasting as an official at the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA), a government organization that invests in technologies that might help the US intelligence community. “I’ve admired their work,” Matheny said of Samotsvety. “Not only their impressive accuracy, but also their commitment to scoring their own accuracy” — meaning they grade themselves so they can know when they fail and need to do better. That, he said, “is really rare institutionally.”</p>
<p id="LQfJlz">What I discovered was that Samotsvety’s record of success wasn’t because its members knew things others didn’t. The factors its members brought up that Saturday to explain their probabilities sounded like the points you’d hear at a think tank event or an academic lecture on China-Taiwan relations. The anonymous member emphasized how ideologically important capturing the island was to Xi Jinping, and how few political constraints he faces. Greg Justice countered that the CCP has depended on economic growth that a war would jeopardize. Murrillo put a higher probability on an attack because of a projection that the US will not be likely to back up Taiwan once the latter’s chip production monopoly has waned due to other <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/25/23806813/eu-chips-act-approved-semiconductor-manufacturing">nations</a> investing in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/16/opinion/america-biden-semiconductor-tsmc.html">fabrication plants</a>.  </p>
<p id="yJezaf">But if the factors being listed reminded me of a normal think tank discussion, the numbers being raised didn’t. Near the end of the session, I asked: If some of you think there are such strong reasons for China to capture Taiwan, why is the highest odds anyone has proposed 24 percent, meaning even the most bullish member thinks such an event is nearly 75 percent likely <em>not </em>to happen? Why does no one here think Chinese control by 2030 is more likely than not?</p>
<p id="iYrBCE">The team had an answer, and it’s an answer that goes some way toward explaining why this group has managed to get so good at predicting the future.</p>
<h3 id="aG0hVZ">The story of Samotsvety</h3>
<p id="Y9D6iK">The name Samotsvety, co-founder Misha Yagudin says, is a multifaceted pun. “It’s Russian for semi-precious stones, or more directly ‘self-lighting/coloring’ stones,” he writes in an email. “It’s a few puns on what forecasting might be: finding nuggets of good info; even if we are not diamonds, together in aggregate we are great; self-lighting is kinda about shedding light on the future.”</p>
<p id="OYAKmw">It began because he and Nuño Sempere needed a name for a Slack they started around 2020 on which they and friends could shoot the shit about forecasting. The two met at a summer fellowship at Oxford’s Future of Humanity Institute, a hotbed of the rationalist subculture where forecasting is a favored activity. Before long, they were competing together in contests like Infer and on platforms like <a href="https://www.gjopen.com/">Good Judgment Open</a>.</p>
<p id="F1eV8h">The latter site is part of the <a href="https://goodjudgment.com/">Good Judgment Project</a>, led by Penn psychologists Philip Tetlock and Barbara Mellers. Those researchers have studied the process of forecasting intensely in recent decades. One of their main findings is that <a href="https://michaelmbishop.github.io/superforecasters.pdf">forecasting ability is not evenly distributed</a>. Some people are consistently much better at it than others, and strong past performance indicates better predictions going forward. These high performers are known as “superforecasters,” a term Tetlock and Gardner would later borrow for their <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Superforecasting-Science-Prediction-Philip-Tetlock/dp/0804136718" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Superforecasting-Science-Prediction-Philip-Tetlock/dp/0804136718?ascsubtag=___vx__p_23834905__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:99,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:3,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;ascsubtag&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;ascsubtag&quot;:&quot;___vx__p_23834905__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}">book</a>.</p>
<p id="15FuSx">Superforecaster® is now a <a href="https://goodjudgment.com/how-to-become-a-superforecaster/">registered trademark of Good Judgment</a>, and not every member of Samotsvety has been through that exact process, although more than half of them (8 of 15) have. I won’t call the group as a whole “superforecasters” here for fear of stealing superforecaster valor. But their team’s track record is strong.</p>
<p id="rhukLG">A common measure of forecasting ability is the <a href="https://www.cultivatelabs.com/crowdsourced-forecasting-guide/what-are-relative-brier-scores-and-how-are-they-calculated">relative Brier score</a>, a number that aggregates the result of every prediction for which an outcome is now known, and then compares each forecaster to the median forecaster. A score of 0 means you’re average; a positive score means worse than average while negative means better than average. In 2021, the last full year Samotsvety participated, their score in the Infer tournament was -2.43, compared to -1.039 for the next-best team. They were more than twice as good as the nearest competition.</p>
<p id="GWIdnR">“If the point of forecasting tournaments is to figure out who you can trust,” the <a href="https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/mantic-monday-31422?s=r">writer Scott Alexander</a> once quipped. “the science has spoken, and the answer is ‘these guys.’”</p>
<p id="Qe8nRN">So, why these guys? Part of the answer is selection. Members’ stories of how they joined the Samotsvety were usually some variation of: I started forecasting, I turned out to be pretty good at it, and the group noticed me. It’s a bit like how a youth soccer prodigy might eventually find themselves on Manchester City.</p>
<p id="ZqDsLL">Molly Hickman came to forecasting by way of the government. Taking a contracting job out of college, she was assigned to IARPA, the intelligence research agency where Jason Matheny and others were running forecasting tournaments. The idea intrigued her, and when she went back to grad school for computer science, she signed up at Infer to try forecasting herself. She put together a team with her dad and some friends, and while the team as a whole didn’t do great, she did amazing. The Samotsvety group saw her scores and invited her to join.</p>
<p id="67db9S">Eli Lifland, a 2020 economics and computer science grad at UVA now <a href="https://www.elilifland.com/">attempting to forecast AI progress</a>, got his start predicting Covid-19. 2020 was in some ways a banner year for forecasting: Superforecasters were <a href="https://time.com/5848271/superforecasters-covid-19/">predicting that Covid would reach hundreds of thousands of cases</a> in February of that year, a time when government officials were still <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/02/17/nih-disease-official-anthony-fauci-risk-of-coronavirus-in-u-s-is-minuscule-skip-mask-and-wash-hands/4787209002/">calling the risk “minuscule.”</a> Users of the forecasting platform <a href="https://www.metaculus.com/news/2020/06/02/LRT/">Metaculus outperformed a panel of epidemiologists</a> when predicting case numbers. Even in that company, Lifland did unusually well. The fast-moving nature of the pandemic made it easy to learn quickly because you could predict cases on a near-weekly basis and quickly realize what you got right or wrong. Before long, Misha and Nuño from Samotsvety came calling.</p>
<p id="rbUMv2">But “select people already good at forecasting” doesn’t explain why Samotsvety is so good. What made these forecasters good enough to win Samotsvety’s attention? What are these people, specifically, doing differently that makes their predictions better than almost everyone else’s?</p>
<h3 id="C6ZyNZ">The habits of highly effective forecasters</h3>
<p id="FN0O3w">The literature on superforecasting, from Tetlock, Mellers, and others, finds some commonalities between good predictors. One is a tendency to think in numbers. Quantitative reasoning sharpens thinking in this context. “Somewhat likely,” “pretty unlikely,” “I’d be surprised.” These kinds of phrases, on their own, convey some useful information about someone’s confidence in a prediction, but they’re impossible to compare to each other — is “pretty unlikely” more or less doubtful than “I’d be surprised”? Numbers, by contrast, are easy to compare, and they provide a means of accountability. Unsurprisingly, many great forecasters, in Samotsvety and elsewhere, have backgrounds in computer science, economics, math, and other quantitative disciplines.</p>
<p id="D1Wx0a">Hickman recalls telling her coworkers in intelligence that she was working on forecasting and being frustrated by their skeptical responses: that it’s impossible to put numbers on such things, that the true probabilities are inherently unknowable. Of course, the true probabilities aren’t known, but that isn’t the point. Even if they weren’t using numbers, her peers were “actually doing these calculations implicitly all the time,” she recalls.</p>
<p id="YtJmZj">You might not tell yourself “the odds of China invading Taiwan this year is 10 percent,” but how much time a deputy assistant Secretary of Defense spends studying, say, Taiwan’s naval strategy is probably a reflection of their concept of the underlying probability. They wouldn’t spend any time if their probability was 0.1 percent; they would be losing their mind if their probability was 90 percent. In reality, it’s somewhere in between. They’re just not making that assessment explicit or putting it in a form that makes it possible to judge their accuracy and from which they can learn in the future. Numeric predictions can be graded; they let you know when you’re wrong and how wrong you are. That’s exactly why they’re so scary to make.</p>
<p id="IOKHIY">That leads to another commonality: practice. Forecasting is a lot like any other skill — you get better with practice — so good forecasters forecast a lot, and that in turn makes them better at it. They also update their forecasts a lot. The Taiwan numbers I heard from the team at the start of our meeting? They weren’t the same by the end. Part of practicing is adjusting and tweaking constantly.</p>
<p id="cugS8M">But not everyone who practices, and uses numbers to do so, succeeds. In <em>Superforecasting</em>, Tetlock and Gardner come up with an array of “commandments” to help us mere mortals do better, but I often find myself struggling to implement them. One is “strike the right balance between under- and overreacting to evidence”; another is “strike the right balance between under- and overconfidence.” Great, I will simply strike correct balances in all things. I will become Ty Cobb by always striking the right balance between swinging too early and swinging too late.</p>
<p id="QYu0Bh">However, another commandment — to pay attention to “base rates” — came up a lot when talking to the Samotsvety team. In forecasting lingo, a “base rate” is the rate at which some event tends to happen. If I want to project the odds that the New York Yankees win the World Series, I might note that out of 119 World Series to date, the Yankees <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/stories/mlb/world-series-winners-complete-list-by-year">have won 27</a>, for a base rate of 22.7 percent. If I knew nothing else about baseball, that would incline me to give the Yankees better odds than any other team to win the next World Series.</p>
<p id="X2krmN">Of course, you’d be a fool to depend on that alone — in baseball, you have a lot more information than base rates to go on, like stats on every player, years of modeling telling you which stats are most predictive of team performance, etc. But when projecting other kinds of events where far less data exists, you often don’t have any more to go on than the base rate.</p>
<p id="AmHnjD">This was the whole explanation, it turns out, for why everyone in the group put a relatively low probability on the odds of a successful Chinese attempt to retake Taiwan by 2030. Members argued over just how strong the reasons for China to attempt such an effort was, but there was broad agreement that the base rate of war — between China and Taiwan or just between countries in general — is <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/number-of-wars-project-mars">not very high</a>. “I think that’s why we were all so far below 50 percent, because we were all starting really low,” Justice explained when I asked.</p>
<p id="uR4ALX">That kind of attention to base rates can be surprisingly powerful. Among other things, it gives you a starting point for questions that might seem otherwise intractable. Say you wanted to predict whether <a href="https://www.vox.com/india" data-source="encore">India</a> will go into a recession next year. Starting by counting up the number of years in which India has had a recession since independence and calculating a probability is a simple way to begin a guess without requiring huge amounts of research. One of my first <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/1/7/21051910/predictions-trump-brexit-recession-2019-2020">successful predictions</a> was that neither India nor China would go into a recession in 2019. I got it right not because I’m an expert on either, but because I paid attention to the base rates.</p>
<p id="whqRS8">But there’s more to successful forecasting than just base rates. For one thing, knowing what base rate to use is itself a bit of an art. Going into the China/Taiwan discussion, I <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Taiwan_Strait_Crisis">counted</a> that there have been four <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashmir_Princess">lethal</a> exchanges <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Dong-Yin">between</a> China and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Taiwan_Strait_Crisis">Taiwan</a> since the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949. That’s four incidents over 75 years, implying that there’s a 5 percent chance of a lethal exchange in a given year. There are six years between now and 2030, so I got a 26.5 percent chance that there’d be a lethal exchange in at least one of them. After adjusting down for the odds that the exchange is just a skirmish versus a full invasion, and compensating for the chances that Taiwan beats China, I got my 5 percent number.</p>
<p id="iZLvrx">But in our discussion, the participants brought up all kinds of other base rates I hadn’t thought of. Sempere alone brought up three. One was the rate at which provinces claimed by China (like Hong Kong, Macau, and Tibet) have eventually been absorbed, peacefully or by force; another was how often control of Taiwan has changed over the last few hundred years (twice; once when Japan took over from the Qing Empire in 1895 and once when the Chinese Nationalists did in 1945); the third base rate used <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Tg5pQCjpefFiqaKjw/limitations-of-laplace-s-rule-of-succession">Laplace’s rule</a>. Laplace’s rule states that the probability of something that hasn’t happened before happening is 1 divided by N+2, where N is the number of times it hasn’t happened in the past. So the odds of the People’s Republic of China invading Taiwan this year is 1 divided by 75 (the number of years since 1949 when this has not happened) plus 2, or 1/77, or 1.3 percent.</p>
<p id="GqfXx2">Sempere averaged his three base rates to get his initial prediction: 8 percent. Is that the best method? Should he have added even more? How should he have adjusted his guess after our discussion? (He nudged up to 12 percent.) There’s no firm rule about these questions. It’s ultimately something that can only be judged by your track record.</p>
<h3 id="Mk6pIR">What if knowing the future is knowing the world?</h3>
<p id="uCvk6i">Justice, the MBA student, tells me that quantitative skill is one reason why the Samotsvety crew is so good at prediction. Another reason is more abstract, maybe even grandiose: that as you forecast, you develop “a better model of the world ... you start to see patterns in how the world works, and then that makes you better at forecasting.”</p>
<p id="HL9wSy">“It’s helpful to think of learning forecasting as having two steps,” he wrote in a follow-up email to me. “The first (and most important) step is the recognition that the future and past will look mostly the same. The second step is isolating that small bundle of cases where the two are different.” And it’s in that second step that developing a clear model of how the world works, and being willing to update that model frequently, is most helpful.</p>
<p id="znOEsC">A lot of Justice’s “updates” to his world model have been toward assuming more continuity. In recent years, he says, he learned a lot from facts like, “Putin didn’t die of cancer, use nukes, or get removed from office; bird flu didn’t jump to and spread among humans (so far); Viktor Orban (very recently) dropped his objection to Ukraine aid.” What these have in common is “they’re predominantly about major events that <em>didn’t</em> happen, implying the future will look a lot like the past.”</p>
<p id="nfEYXW">The hardest part of the job is predicting those rare exceptions where everything changes. Samotsvety’s big coming-out party happened in early 2022 when they published an <a href="https://samotsvety.org/blog/2022/03/10/samotsvety-nuclear-risk-forecasts-march-2022/">estimate of the odds that London would be hit by nuclear weapons</a> as a result of the Ukraine conflict. Their estimated odds of a reasonably prepared Londoner dying from a nuclear warhead in the next month were 0.00241 percent: very, very low, all things considered. The prediction got some <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/micromorts-nuclear-war/">press attention</a> and earned rejoinders from nuclear experts like Peter Scoblic, who argued it significantly <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/W8dpCJGkwrwn7BfLk/nuclear-expert-comment-on-samotsvety-nuclear-risk-forecast-2">understated the risk of a nuclear exchange</a>. It was a big moment for the group — but also an example of a prediction that’s very, very difficult to get right. The further you’re straying from the ordinary course of history (and a nuclear bomb going off in London would be straying very far), the harder this is.</p>
<p id="Uh7QKL">The tight connection between forecasting and building a model of the world helps explain why so much of the early interest in the idea came from the intelligence community. Matheny and colleagues wanted to develop a tool that could give policymakers real-time numerical probabilities, something that intelligence reports have historically not done, much to policymakers’ consternation. As early as 1973, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1e_9pEYgRPsF0R1EMXUQIb6TSXw9fIZNM/view">Secretary of State Henry Kissinger was telling colleagues</a> he wished “intelligence would supply him with estimates of the relevant betting odds.”</p>
<p id="UvdXJ5">Matheny’s experiment ran through 2020. It included both the aggregative contingent estimation (ACE), which used members of the public and grew into the Good Judgment Project, and the IC Prediction Market (ICPM), which was available to intelligence analysts with access to classified information. The two sources of information were <a href="https://goodjudgment.io/docs/Goldstein-et-al-2015.pdf">about equally accurate</a>, despite the outsiders’ lack of classified access. The experiment was exciting enough to spawn a <a href="https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2021/04/15/how-spooks-are-turning-to-superforecasting-in-the-cosmic-bazaar">UK offshoot</a>. But funding on the US side of the Atlantic ran out, and the culture of forecasting in intelligence died off.</p>
<p id="43Y8qh">To Matheny, it’s a crying shame, and he wishes that government institutions and think tanks like his would get back into the habit and act a bit more like Samotsvety. “People might assume that the methods that we use in most institutions that are responsible for analysis have been well-evaluated. And in fact, they haven’t. Even when there are organizations whose decisions cost billions of dollars or even trillions, billions of dollars in the case of key national security decisions,” he told me. Forecasting, by contrast, works. So what are we waiting for?</p>

<a href="https://streamable.com/y5nhy7" rel="nofollow">https://streamable.com/y5nhy7</a><p>&gt; You can't escape personal due diligence and "it was top ranked!" has never been that.</p><p>On one hand that's a fair point and I should've known better. OTOH I think it is legit to trust top app store search results to return quality apps, especially if there is a massive disparity between their quality. The scam app has obvious repetitive spam reviews. The developer's website is terrible and the submit button doesn't even work. This is basic quality control on apple's part. If every single app store user needs to manually vet every single app they install to the proper extent there would be a fraction of a fraction of the installs and respectively, a fraction of a fraction of the revenue.</p><p>Consider the extent of lawsuits between apple and companies with app store apps - does it not strike you that apple protects that revenue stream? Wouldn't it make sense to give app store users a sense of trust in the top search results?

Which is what I did. The apple app indeed received it and promptly sent it off somewhere else. What's even crazier is that the apple app shows this info!

<h2><a name="index1h1"></a>Introduction</h2>

<pre><code>10 PRINT "HELLO"
20 GOTO 10
</code></pre>

<p>In April, 1984, my father bought a computer for his home office, a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_800#ABC_802">Luxor ABC-802</a>, with a
Z80 CPU, 64 kilobytes of RAM, a yellow-on-black screen with 80 by 25
text mode, or about 160 by 75 pixels in graphics mode, and two floppy
drives. It had BASIC in its ROM, and came with absolutely no games. If
I wanted to play with it, I had to learn how to program, and write my
own games. I learned BASIC, and over the next few years would learn
Pascal, C, and more. I had found my passion. I was 14 years old and I
knew what I wanted to do when I grew up.</p>

<p>When I was learning how to program, I thought it was important to
really understand how computers work, how programming languages work,
and how various tools like text editors work. I wanted to hone my
craft and produce the finest code humanly possible. I was wrong.</p>

<p>This essay is a condensation of what I wish I had been told after I
had learned the basics of how to code. Instead, I was told, in person
and in magazine articles, that by the time I would be twenty five
years old, I'd be too old to work as a programmer. It was critical
that I learn as many algorithms, data structures, and languages as
quickly as possible. Programming was, after all, a young man's game,
and required being able to stay up all night, every night, to crank
out more code than anyone else. That was the only way to succeed. It
turns out that none of that was true: not the part about youth, nor
the part of missing sleep, and especially not the part about gender.</p>

<p>As I write this essay, it will soon be forty years to the day since I
first wrote computer code. I've managed to support myself by
developing software, and I still write code every day. There is
nothing else I would rather do for a living. I can't point at
enormous successes and impressive feats, but I hope that surviving for
decades in the industry gives me sufficient credentials to speak about
software development.</p>

<p>This essay discusses some of the things I've learned about how to
successfully build software. These are things I've learned from my own
experience; I'm not a researcher, and there are few references to
sources, and this is largely not supported by evidence. I'm basing
this essay on my own experience, and if you disagree, that's fine.</p>

<p>My goal in this essay is to get the reader to think, to research, to
learn, to ponder. My goal is not to tell the reader how to think, what
to think, how things are, or to give the answer to every question
about every aspect of the process of building software.</p>

<h2><a name="index2h1"></a>The core skills</h2>

<p>Interesting and significant software is beyond the capacity of any one
person to build alone in a reasonable time frame. This means that the
fundamental, crucial, core skills in building software are
communication and collaboration.</p>

<p>It's not enough to know how computers work, how to use programming
languages, to know algorithms and data structures, or how to use the
varied tools involved in software construction. You also need to know
how to talk with other people to learn what software to build, what it
must do, how much effort is acceptable, how to manage the work, and
many more things. You have know how to work with others to build
something together that's bigger than any of you. If you and your team
can do it well, it'll be bigger than the sum of you. Team work can be
a force multiplier.</p>

<p>These are difficult skills to learn. I've found them much more
difficult than any technical part of building software.</p>

<p>Even in the projects where I'm the only person, there are at least
three people involved: past me, present me, and future me.</p>

<ul>
<li>Past me is a lazy and careless slob who always leaves a mess.</li>
<li>Present me does superb work, but has to cope with all the stupid
stuff done by past me, and needs to placate future me.</li>
<li>Future me is an egotistic and opinionated snob for whom nothing is ever
good enough.</li>
</ul>


<p>Getting these three people to get along well enough to get anything
done is a constant struggle for me. I use my journal to cope. I write
there what I do, why, and what the result is. I try to write so that
I'll understand it, even if I'm tired, or have just experienced a
short term neuralizer mind wipe a la Men in Black. I also plan
explicit iterations, with specific tasks, and I use the GTD system to
track things that still need to done.</p>

<h2><a name="index3h1"></a>On productivity</h2>

<p>What productivity means is not well defined for software development:
time is easy to measure, but the output is not. Most people have at
least a vague idea what productivity means to them. However, there are
known factors that impact productivity---these are customarily
ignored.</p>

<p>To do good work you need to take care of yourself. You have to sleep
well. You have to eat well. If you're tired, or have too much stress,
you'll make mistakes and bad decisions. These result in you doing bad
work. That's not a moral problem, but you may have to fix your own
mistakes. You'll enjoy life, and work, more if you do good work.</p>

<p>Hillel Wayne has talked about sleep and has sources. Recommended

</ul>


<p>You also need to have an environment that helps you do good work. Is
it quiet? Are there interruptions? Is the furniture comfortable, and
unlikely to hurt you in the long run? Do you have access to
necessities, such as a toilet and tea? Can you take a break from your
work area? Can you go for a walk: walking helps thinking. This is an
incomplete list.</p>

<p>Further, you need to manage yourself and your work in ways that suit
you. The best way to do this depends on who you are, your preferences
and experiences, and the kind of work you do. There is no single
solution that works for everyone all the time.</p>

<p>For myself, I've found applying the David Allen <a href="https://gtdfh.liw.fi/">Getting Things
Done</a> system has worked well, but whatever you
do, you need to know what you need to achieve, today and in the near
future, and you need to arrange things so that you can concentrate on
one thing at a time. Note, however, that I use the GTD system partly
to know that I can slack off; I do not aim to be as productive as
possible at all times.</p>

<p>It may be worth tracking what you've done. Reflecting on that can give
you a sense of achievement, and lets you see the progress you make.
This can be a motivation and morale booster.</p>

<p>Multi-tasking is fine for a computer, but your brain can only think
about one thing at a time and has really miserable context switching.</p>

<h2><a name="index4h1"></a>On governance</h2>

<p>When a group collaborates, one of the things they need to establish
early on is governance: basically, how does the group make decisions,
and how do they change them? The decisions range from the fundamental
to the mundane: Who is in the group? Is it a democracy, or hierarchy,
or some other structure? Who gets to have a say? What beverages does
the group get? What font should the website use?</p>

<p>Governance is difficult, but it's easier when it's explicit.
Uncertainty about responsibility and power results in confusion and
quarrel, and these can tear a group apart.</p>

<p>All groups eventually have conflicts. Managing this and resolving
differences is nominally the job of management, but really it falls on
everyone. This requires skills that seem to be rarely taught to
programmers, which is a shame.</p>

<h2><a name="index5h1"></a>On politics and ethics</h2>

<p>Software development is always a political and ethical act. Whenever
you're building software, you have to make a myriad of decisions:</p>

<ul>
<li>what shall the software do?</li>
<li>what resources will using it require?</li>
<li>how shall it be used?</li>
<li>what abilities shall using it require?</li>
<li>what things will be easy to do?</li>
<li>what things will be hard to do?</li>
<li>will the software empower its users, or force them to do things for
someone else's benefit?</li>
</ul>


<p>All these decisions have consequences, which will favor some people
over other people. Hence, they have political and ethical
aspects, which need to be considered.</p>

<p>As an example, if you make something that can be used with a cheap
phone, you enable most people in the world to use it. If you make
it so that it requires expensive hardware, you exclude many people,
especially poor people. Sometimes that is inevitable, and inherent in
the problem you're building software to solve, but it's still a
choice.</p>

<p>There may not be a right or wrong choice for a particular decision,
but there are always consequences. You have to consider them, and
decide if they're acceptable, and for whom.</p>

<p>In general, the software you build will reflect some values. Make sure
you know you agree with them.</p>

<h2><a name="index1h2"></a>On ethics and software freedom</h2>

<p>Free and open source software is the ethical kind of software.
Software freedom is essential for the well-being of people whose lives
are affected by the use of computers, whether they are using computers
directly or someone else is using computers to do things that matter
to other people.</p>

<p>I have been writing free software since 1986, when I first read the
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/manifesto.html">GNU Manifesto</a> on a BBS. (The
term "open source" is a synonym: I do not care to debate the
differences between the two.)</p>

<p>Much of my career has involved building open source software. My
preference for free and open source over non-free software is clear,
and well documented.</p>

<p>Entire libraries' worth of text has been produced over the past three
decades about the ethics of free and open source software versus other
kinds, and specifics of licenses. I'm not going to make a summary of
arguments here, or even point at recommended reading.</p>

<p>I wanted to make my position clear, in case it matters to the reader.
However, very little of this essay, including the topic of ethics, is
related to software freedom and applies equally to the development
non-free software.</p>

<h2><a name="index6h1"></a>On diversity and quality</h2>

<p>Human rights are fundamentally important. Treating other people well
is the right thing to do. All of this is of paramount priority,
whatever you do. If you don't agree with this, I have no hope for
you.</p>

<p>In a software development context, I've found that the most crucial
thing for building high quality software is to have diversity of
thought among the people contributing to it. The more different kinds
of thinking is brought into the project, the more likely the decisions
will work for more circumstances, for more people, and deal with more
things going wrong.</p>

<p>Diversity of thought comes from different kinds of people coming from
different backgrounds and having lived different kinds of lives.
Sometimes differences are visible externally, sometimes not.</p>

<p>When in doubt, choose different. If you exclude people based on them
being unlike you, you will likely be choosing poorly.</p>

<p>Diversity doesn't guarantee success. Nothing guarantees success.
However, uniformity guarantees you get one-sided answers. Sometimes
that's enough, but often it's not.</p>

<p>Collaboration and communication can certainly be more challenging in a
diverse setting. Do not fear this. Treat challenges as an opportunity
to learn, to become better at what you do.</p>

<p>People will make mistakes, and you too will make them. It's a good
policy to be benign and kind when others make mistakes, and expect
that from others in return. Punishing others for mistakes will leave
you alone.</p>

<h2><a name="index7h1"></a>On maintenance</h2>

<p>It is widely considered, in the software industry, that most of the cost of
software production comes after the initial release, in the so called
maintenance phase. The initial development might take a year or two,
maintenance will take decades.</p>

<p>One would think that this would lead to development practices, and
architectural decision, and everything else to be optimized for lower
maintenance costs. Unfortunately, the economic and other incentives
favor the opposite. In most companies, the event horizon tends to be a
quarter year, or a full year at most. It's not considered acceptable to spend
a lot more effort now to save most of the effort in the long term.</p>

<p>Even for personal hobby projects, there is often a strong urge to get
something working as soon as possible rather than taking one's time to
do things well,
but at least that's an internal urge, not external pressure. Even so,
the end result is the same: software that's harder to change later on,
when bugs are found, requirements change, or the software needs to be
adapted to changes in the surrounding system or ecosystem.</p>

<p>I am not alone in seeing the problem. I don't think it can be solved,
unless the economic incentives are radically changed. It's on
individual developers to try to reduce maintenance costs
surreptitiously, when they can, as a kind of preemptive guerrilla
maintenance.</p>

<h2><a name="index8h1"></a>Big questions for projects</h2>

<p>I find that it's important, but also helpful, to answer a few
questions at the beginning of every new project. The answers don't
have to be final, and it's OK to change them at any time: if you don't
adjust your thinking when you learn new things, you're not good at
what you do. The answers can even be inane, as long as they're honest.
The point to is to get you thinking about the questions at all.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>For whom are you building the software? Whose opinions about it
matter?</p>

<p>This tells you some of the stakeholders in the project. There will
likely be more stakeholders later on, but it's a start. Knowing who
the stakeholders are lets you concentrate on their needs. This helps
make the project a success.</p>

<p>The stakeholders might be the end users, or might be the CEO. If you
think it's the end users, but it's actually the CEO, you will
make decisions that make the CEO unhappy, and the project will fail,
and you won't understand why. And vice versa.</p></li>
<li><p>Why are you building the software?</p>

<p>"It's my job" might be a very practical answer. It's an answer that
means that you need to re-evaluate everything if the chance of
getting money is reduced. A different answer might be more about
passion, or mission, and this means your reaction to changing
circumstances is going to be different. There's no wrong answer
here, but be sure to be honest, at least to yourself.</p></li>
<li><p>What should the software do, in broad strokes? Also, what should it
not do?</p>

<p>This is about knowing if you're building a word processor or a
spreadsheet. It's not about detailed requirements or acceptance
criteria.</p></li>
<li><p>How should the software work, in broad strokes?</p>

<p>Again, big picture view. Are you making a command line tool, a web
service, an operating system, a mobile app, or something else? What
type and size of hardware?</p></li>
<li><p>What's important and what is just nice to have?</p>

<p>This gets into requirements and acceptance criteria. You need to
know them to build something good. Write them down. Also write down
how you verify you meet them.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2><a name="index9h1"></a>Planning and estimating</h2>

<p>Detailed planning beyond the very near future is difficult and usually
fails. This includes estimating how long the work will take. I avoid
doing this.</p>

<p>Planning and estimation are far from useless and should not be
neglected. I plan and I estimate, but within the limits of what I've
learned to be realistic. Specifically, I find it nearly impossible to
make detailed plans beyond a one or two week iteration. By detailed
plans I mean figuring out tasks at a granularity of what can be done
in one sitting.</p>

<p>Something surprising usually happens that ruins the plans beyond a
couple of weeks. It might be management changing priorities, or the
client changing their mind, or the company going bankrupt, or being
bought. It might be something else, but usually something happens. If
an iteration is short, you don't lose too much if all your planning
has to be thrown away.</p>

<p>You can also react more easily if you need to change course.</p>

<p>I stress that I'm talking about detailed planning here. It's fine to
make plans for what to do next month or next quarter, as long as
everyone involved knows that these plans are likely to have to change,
and the plans are kept suitably high level.</p>

<p>An analogy: if you're planning a road trip across the country, you
will probably want to plan what cities to drive through. You probably
don't want plan every stop to fill up on fuel or to eat. You want to
leave enough flexibility that you can change route if there's an
accident, or weather, or something else that may come as a surprise on
the way.</p>

<p>Iteration works. Nothing else seems to work for large software
projects. At least I've never seen any other approach work.</p>

<p>For me, iterations work better if they're focused. Having an explicit,
clear goal helps cut down on scope creep. It concentrates work to aim
at the iteration goal, rather than on what seems like a good idea in
the moment.</p>

<p>When I plan for an iteration, I break things into small tasks that can
be finished in one sitting. My estimates for tasks fall into four
buckets: up to a quarter hour, full hour, four hours, or too long. I
prefer the shorter tasks: they're easier to estimate, and easier to
do, and usually break fewer things. Anything that's too long needs to
be broken down further.</p>

<p>Some tasks are impossible to estimate. Debugging is a typical example.
How long will it take you to realize the Ethernet cable is broken, or
an operating system update broke things, or find the cause of some
other unforeseen problem? Debugging happens, and you had best leave
enough slack in your planning to cope with some troubleshooting.</p>

<p>Interruptions also happen. Sometimes you have no option but to react
and respond to them immediately. Leave room for that.</p>

<h2><a name="index10h1"></a>Express yourself in writing</h2>

<p>Your memory is fleeting and fallible. You will forget details. You
will forget important stuff. You will remember things wrongly. When
you collaborate, you and others will disagree on what was said, agreed
upon, and decided.</p>

<p>I was once in a meeting, with four people, plus the CTO. The CTO
forbade us to take notes: it seems the fad of the week was that
note taking is what makes meetings a waste of time. The meeting took
two hours. Afterwards, the four of us had about eight different
opinions of what had been decided. No follow-up actions were ever
taken.</p>

<p>Write things down. It seems like a stupid chore, tedious, boring, and
archaic, but it's the way organizations remember. Writing things down
is a super power that is easily overlooked.</p>

<p>Your team should keep meeting minutes, covering at least the
important decisions, and what actions everyone should do after the meeting.
Keep them short enough that they're easy write, and to read.
Archive them somewhere everyone can look at them at any time. This
helps people who weren't there, perhaps because they were on vacation,
or only join a year later.</p>

<p>Apropos meetings, learn how to have good meetings. What works for me
is an agenda set well ahead of time, with supporting materials.
Prepare for the meeting so that you don't waste everyone's time. Have
a chair who keeps discussion on track, and time boxed. Your process
for a good meeting might be different, but you should find one.</p>

<h2><a name="index11h1"></a>On doing work</h2>

<p>When making a change, make only one change at a time. If you can, split the
change you're making into smaller partial changes. Small changes are
easier to understand and less likely to be catastrophic.</p>

<p>Automate away friction: running tests, making a release, packaging,
delivery, deployment, etc. Do this from as early
on as feasible. Set up a pipeline where you can make a change and make
sure the software still works and willing users can start using the
changed software. The smoother you can make this pipeline, the easier
it will be to build the software.</p>

<p>Use version control for every project. Practice continuous integration
by merging changes to the main line of development often.</p>

<p>Develop an automated test suite that you trust: if tests pass, you can
make a release, or deploy to production. This usually means starting
the test suite early on in the project. Make sure the automated tests
cover all aspects you care about: the goal is to make sure that what
you give to others works they way it's intended. Update production
code and test code together.</p>

<p>Run the test suite many times in a row to identify flaky tests. Do not
suffer flaky tests.</p>

<p>Do stress or load testing, even if you only do it in simple ways. You
don't know your software and system can handle 10,000 concurrent users
until you've done so. Mine didn't.</p>

<p>In one job, we had a system that had worked fine in production for a
while. We deployed it to a customer who had a lot more traffic. Our
software failed. The problem turned out that we ran out of TCP port
numbers: we made an HTTP request for each incoming message, but we
didn't re-use the underlying TCP connection. There was so much traffic
that all possible port numbers were used, and then everything stalled.
The fix was to re-use the TCP connection, a change that took about one
line, and then everything worked fine. We would have found this
ourselves had we done even the simplest load testing.</p>

<p>If possible, use the software yourself. You'll understand your users
better.</p>

<p>Watch other people use the software. You'll understand your software's
sharp corners better. True story: it's hard for people who've not been
involved in the development of software to use the software, if it has
three different names for the same thing. Seeing someone struggle with
this makes it painfully obvious.</p>

<p>Treat testers as friends who help you find when you've made a mistake.
They're not out to humiliate you. Nobody is so perfect that they never
make mistakes or overlook details or forget entire features. Don't ask
me how I know.</p>

<h2><a name="index12h1"></a>Advice on coding</h2>

<p>Simple, obvious code is easier to write, easier to get to work, easier
to understand, and easier to change without breaking it. Simplify
things as much as you can, but no more than that. Sacrifice simplicity
at the altar of performance only when you have proven the performance
gains are worth it.</p>

<p>Complexity is the enemy you think is a friend.</p>

<p>Coupling and cohesion are still important concepts.</p>

<p>In every project, conceptual clarity is important. Also, keep your
terminology consistent. Confusion lurks where clarity hides. With
great confusion comes great annoyance and the certainty of bugs.</p>

<p>Speed is a feature to users, but not always for development, as too
much haste leaves too little time to think. Functionality can be a
misfeature.</p>

</ul>


<h2><a name="index13h1"></a>Developing a career</h2>

<p>You can choose to be a deep expert on something very specific, or to
be a generalist, or some mix. Choose wisely. There may not be any
wrong choice, but every choice has consequences.</p>

<p>Be humble. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witches_(Discworld)">Be Nanny, not Granny</a>. People may respect the powerful
witch more, but they like the kind one better.</p>

<p>Be open and honest. Treat others fairly. You don't have to believe in
karma for it to work, so make it work for you, not against you.</p>

<p>Help and lift up others. But at the same time, don't allow others to
abuse or take advantage of you. You don't need to accept bullshit. Set
your boundaries.</p>

<p>Ask for help when you need it, or when you get stuck. Accept help when
offered.</p>

<p>I am not the right person to talk about developing a career, but when
I've done the above, things have usually ended up going well.</p>

<h2><a name="index14h1"></a>Takeaway</h2>

<p>Take care of yourself. Sleep. Eat. Exercise. Rest. Relax. Take care of
other people, as best you can. People are important. Software is just
fun.</p>

      <h3 id="offering">What can Chyrp Lite do for me?</h3>
      <p>
        Chyrp Lite makes it possible to host a blog on your own web server with minimal fuss. You can have a traditional blog, a tumbleblog, or you can add oodles of customisation and build a general-purpose web publishing platform with blogging features on the side. You get four beautiful blog themes and a friendly administration console, all fully navigable on a broad range of devices, thanks to the power of responsive HTML5. Semantic markup and comprehensive ARIA labelling ensure your blog will be accessible to visitors who use assistive technologies.
      </p>
      <p>
        With a flexible system of Feathers and Pages, you can make your website whatever you want it to be. Feathers enable different types of blog content – you can restrict yourself to absolute textual purity, or you can create a multimedia rainbow. Pages let you publish articles separate from your blog content – be it a simple colophon or a hierarchy of multiple pages.

  <p>“The Netherlands hosts some of the world’s largest internet exchanges. This obliges us to make the best use of these exchanges for our national security. With the Temporary Cyber Act, we will make optimum use of the data carried on our cables to protect The Netherlands against Russian and Chinese hackers” – <a href="https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/actueel/nieuws/2024/03/12/inlichtingendiensten-kunnen-sneller-en-beter-optreden-tegen-cyberdreiging">Dutch government announcement</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I wrote this earlier, but did not publish it then because I wasn’t happy with the post. However, since <a href="https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/actueel/nieuws/2024/03/12/inlichtingendiensten-kunnen-sneller-en-beter-optreden-tegen-cyberdreiging">the new Dutch Intelligence and Security act just passed</a>, it is relevant for an international audience. Earlier, I wrote a piece for <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/dutch-intel-law-about-intel/">about:intel</a>, and in there you can find further discussion in English.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Of specific note, this law vastly expands when the Dutch agencies can perform SIGINT on Dutch Internet Exchanges like the Amsterdam Internet Exchange. These powers extend to any form of communication, including private peering and Private Network Interconnects (PNI). Every cable must be made available for ’exploration’, and it is likely that due to the wording in the new law, any request for such examination will be granted by the commission that rules on these things. Such exploration includes the right to send data to foreign intelligence agencies, including non-European ones.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Secondly, the law also makes it clear that requests for full intercepts should now mostly be judged on technical terms (‘is the request complete’) and with much less emphasis of the merits of full SIGINT. But do read on for the details.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Today, the upper house of Dutch parliament passed a law to reduce (I think) the oversight on the Dutch intelligence and security services, while simultaneously granting them more leeway to execute their powers. <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/resignation-as-intelligence-regulator/">In 2022, I resigned as regulator of the Dutch intelligence and security services because of this attempt</a>. Politico.eu wrote <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/intelligence-watchdog-bert-hubert-netherlands-hacking-cyber-law/">a comprehensive article</a> about it, representing various points of view.</p>
<p>In this page I will try to explain how the new law works and what these changes mean. I also provide some context from the European Court of Human Rights<!-- and the EU Court of Justice-->. This page refers to the just passed version of the proposed legislation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is also a <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/uitleg-over-de-wiv-2/">far longer page in Dutch</a>. This post is an attempt to summarise the changes for an international audience.</p>

</center>
<h2 id="applicability">Applicability</h2>
<p>The Dutch Law on Intelligence and Security Services defines a broad set of powers. It is also a somewhat odd law with a long history.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An English translation of a 2016 draft of the law <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/growth/tools-databases/tris/index.cfm/en/search/?trisaction=search.detail&amp;year=2016&amp;num=188&amp;dLang=EN">can be found on the European Commission website</a>. Note that this is a draft and it definitely differs from <a href="https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0039896">the law that is in force (Dutch)</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A remarkable aspect of the law is that it is universally applicable - it extends as much powers to spy on Dutch people as those from other countries. There are no general protections for people from or in The Netherlands or in the EU. This stands in stark contrast to US legislation which provides some privacy protection to ‘US Persons’, but to no one else.</p>
<p>In addition, the powers can be used around the world - Dutch agencies are free to hack computers anywhere, or to intercept communications anywhere.</p>
<h2 id="interests">Interests</h2>
<p>The services can investigate anything or anyone that gives rise to the suspicion that their activities or goals might be harmful for the survival of the system of democratic rule of law, for security or other important interests of the state. In addition, the services can investigate other countries.</p>
<h2 id="powers">Powers</h2>
<p>The powers granted to the services are broad, but also largely ‘read-only’. The services do not operate drones (unlike the CIA), and they have limited powers to intervene or disturb things, with one exception.</p>
<ul>
<li>Article 40: Observing and following people and objects</li>
<li>Article 41: Operate &amp; instruct agents, who are allowed to break other laws under specific conditions</li>
<li>Article 42: Enter &amp; investigate closed objects and premises</li>
<li>Article 43: Collect, store and match DNA data from people</li>
<li>Article 44: Intercept and investigate physical post and packages</li>
<li>Article 45: Hack ‘automated works’, computers in the very broadest sense of the word</li>
<li>Article 47: Intercept any form of (tele)communications from a specific person, organization of technical identifier</li>
<li>Article 48: Intercept &amp; record whole cables</li>
<li>Article 49: Investigate data recorded under article 48 to find targets or technical identifiers</li>
<li>Article 50: Select part of the data recorded under article 48 for use in intelligence/security investigations</li>
<li>Article 54: Requisitioning data</li>
<li>Article 60: Perform automated analysis and “machine learning” on all data, including 48 data</li>
<li>Article 73: “Undertake measures to protect interests of the services”</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="subjects-of-these-powers">Subjects of these powers</h2>
<p>The law is somewhat unique that all these powers are only tied to the <em>interests</em> the services protect, and not to specific people. So unlike police forces, the services can spy not only on direct targets of investigation, they can also eavesdrop ’non-targets’ (who might know interesting things about targets) or even hack ’third parties’ that could function as a stepping stone to useful information.</p>
<p>Before the services can use their investigatory powers on non-targets or third parties, they do have to explain why this is the only way for an investigation to proceed.</p>
<h2 id="oversight-warrant-process">Oversight, warrant process</h2>
<p>For all of the powers, there must be internal sign-off. Depending on the nature, this sign-off can be mandated to lower ranking employees. The most infringing powers however need to be approved by the relevant minister. Then, the <a href="https://tib-ivd.nl/">ex-ante regulator</a> rules if this permission was obtained lawfully. The minister takes the political decision, the ex-ante regulator verifies this decision. The opinion of the ex-ante regulator is binding.</p>
<p>In addition, there is <a href="https://ctivd.nl/">a non-binding ex-post regulator</a>.</p>
<h2 id="administrative-warrant-extensions">Administrative warrant extensions</h2>
<p>The powers are available for use on people or organizations. If someone turns out to have an additional phone number, or starts using a different phone number, a warrant can administratively be updated with this new information. No new permission process is required. In addition, if a warrant was written to target an organization, if this organization was described well, newly discovered members of the organization can also be added to a warrant administratively.</p>
<p>Crucially, such administrative extensions can not be used to add non-targets or third parties - these can not have been a member of a well described organization.</p>
<h2 id="sigint">SIGINT</h2>
<p>The SIGINT or bulk interception powers are complicated. The intelligence and security law considers that the copying, collecting and storing of data is a lesser infringement than actually looking at the data. This is in line with recent European Court of Human Rights precedents. The infringement of privacy increases at every step of the intelligence process, from collection to storing to selecting relevant communications to exploiting such communications for intelligence/security purposes. Crucially however, merely intercepting and storing data is already an infringement that needs a justification.</p>
<p>Article 48 provides for the collection powers. Services need to describe why a specific cable is interesting, and what they expect to achieve with that data. They must also use a well-targeted cable, one that is expected to best provide the data the services are interested in. There are also some restrictions on traffic with origin and destination in The Netherlands.</p>
<p>Article 49 enables technical analysis of this data to see if it includes interesting targets or subjects. Article 50 meanwhile allows for the selection of communications for dissemination to intelligence teams.</p>
<p>Finally, with specific permission, article 60 allows for the algorithmic analysis of all data intercepted under article 48. It was not found possible to properly limit what “algorithmic analysis” might be, so this was left to the ex-ante regulator to determine. In an adversarial reading, “finding all email from a specific person” might be dressed up as an algorithmic analysis. This means article 60 could be an alternative to article 50, and thus it needs the same level of regulatory scrutiny.</p>
<h2 id="proposed-changes">Proposed changes</h2>
<p>In the proposed additional ‘cyber law’, several things would change:</p>
<ul>
<li>The non-binding ex-post regulator gets binding oversight powers on select capabilities. To actually stop an operation involves a heavyweight procedure which can also be stayed. In addition, the regulator needs a lot of new highly technical staff which has been hard to find.</li>
<li>Hacking operations no longer need to detail plans or technical risks to the regulator. These risks include the leaking of ‘zero days’, or damaging non-target or third party services. In addition, technical risk includes the possibility that the facilities installed by the services could be abused by yet other services or hackers.</li>
<li>Hacking operations no longer need to be tied to specific groups of people or organizations. It will become possible to hack into generic companies, for example to enable the retrieval of phone location data in the future. For such strategic hacks on infrastructure, no technical risks need to be described to the regulator.</li>
<li>Services gain the power to intercept and store any cable for a year, no matter where it leads to, and also store the data for a year. No justification needs to be given for this exploration beyond that there is an interest in figuring out what traffic a cable carries. Data collected under this article may be investigated for a whole year, but (crucially!) not for any other purpose than finding targets. Such exploratory data can be shared with foreign and non-EU intelligence agencies.</li>
<li>In addition, the article 48 powers can now be applied based solely on ‘indications’ what the technical plans are with this data. The regulators are instructed to mostly only study these indications, to the detriment of proportionality, subsidiarity and ‘as targeted as possible’ requirements. The indications are non-binding and the services have the liberty to do other things during the year if they need to. <strong>In effect, regulators do not have a lot left to regulate with this change</strong>.</li>
<li>The administrative permissionless extension of warrants is extended to <em>NON-TARGETS</em>. This means that if a hacker group is being targeted, warrants for eavesdropping, hacking, requisitioning are automatically extended to the <em>victims</em> of those hackers as well. This means that the additional test that used to apply to non-targets is no longer required, and instead, non-targets now get less protection than targets (!).</li>
<li>Algorithmic analysis on bulk intercepted data no longer needs regulatory approval. Since it is not well described what this automated analysis entails, this is a large expansion of powers that are not regulated up front. The European Court of Human Rights argues explicitly that such automated analysis needs safeguards (see below)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="some-context">Some context</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng?i=001-210077">CASE OF BIG BROTHER WATCH AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM</a> - with particular attention to:
<ul>
<li>“330. The Court considers that Article 8 applies at each of the above stages. While the initial interception followed by the immediate discarding of parts of the communications does not constitute a particularly significant interference, the degree of interference with individuals’ Article 8 rights will increase as the bulk interception process progresses. In this regard, the Court has clearly stated that even the mere storing of data relating to the private life of an individual amounts to an interference within the meaning of Article 8 (see Leander v. Sweden, 26 March 1987, § 48, Series A no. 116), and that <strong>the need for safeguards will be all the greater where the protection of personal data undergoing automatic processing is concerned</strong> (see S. and Marper, cited above, § 103). The fact that the stored material is in coded form, intelligible only with the use of computer technology and capable of being interpreted only by a limited number of persons, can have no bearing on that finding (see Amann v. Switzerland [GC], no. 27798/95, § 69, ECHR 2000‑II and S. and Marper, cited above, §§ 67 and 75).”</li>
</ul>
</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/03-12-2024-stackable-moderation">https://bsky.social/about/blog/03-12-2024-stackable-moderation</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39684027">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><header><section><a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog">Blog</a><svg width="8" height="12" viewBox="0 0 8 12" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M2 10L6 6L2 2" stroke="#667999" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="square"></path></svg><span>Bluesky’s Stackable Approach to Moderation</span></section><div><p>March 12, 2024</p><p><span>by <!-- -->The Bluesky Team</span></p></div></header><div><p>Bluesky was created to put <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/02-22-2024-open-social-web">users and communities in control</a> of their social spaces online. The first generation of social media platforms connected the world, but ended up consolidating power in the hands of a few corporations and their leaders. Our online experience doesn’t have to depend on billionaires unilaterally making decisions over what we see. On an open social network like Bluesky, you can shape your experience for yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Today, we’re excited to announce that we’re <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/ozone-ui">open-sourcing Ozone</a>, our collaborative moderation tool. With Ozone, individuals and teams can work together to review and label content across the network. Later this week, we’re opening up the ability for you to run your own independent moderation services, seamlessly integrated into the Bluesky app.</strong> This means that you'll be able to create and subscribe to additional moderation services on top of what Bluesky requires, giving you unprecedented control over your social media experience.</p>
<p>At Bluesky, we’re investing in safety from two angles. First, we've built our own moderation team dedicated to providing around-the-clock coverage to uphold our <a href="https://bsky.social/about/support/community-guidelines">community guidelines</a>. Additionally, we recognize that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to moderation — no single company can get online safety right for every country, culture, and community in the world. So we’ve also been building something bigger — an ecosystem of moderation and open-source safety tools that gives communities power to create their own spaces, with their own norms and preferences. Still, using Bluesky feels familiar and intuitive. It's a straightforward app on the surface, but under the hood, we have enabled real innovation and competition in social media by building a new kind of open network.</p>
<p>In designing these moderation services, <strong>Bluesky operated by three principles</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Simple and Powerful:</strong> Give users a pleasant default experience, with customization options under the hood</li>
<li><strong>User Choice:</strong> Empower users and communities to develop their own moderation systems</li>
<li><strong>Openness:</strong> Create an open system that increases trust in the governance of our digital spaces</li>
</ul>
<p>We first shared our vision for <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/4-13-2023-moderation">composable moderation</a> before Bluesky even had 20,000 users last year. Now, we serve over 5 million users. In this blog post, we’ll dive into how moderation works on the network, where you can choose and customize all the pieces that make up your social media experience.</p>
<h2>Sensible Defaults with User Choice</h2>
<p>In everything we build, we aim to provide a polished user experience with further customization options for those you who want them. When you sign up for Bluesky, you will be subscribed to Bluesky’s built-in moderation service by default. This is similar to how custom feeds work on Bluesky — we’ll show you a couple feeds by default, but you can also create and subscribe to more. Bluesky’s moderation service combines around-the-clock coverage by our team to resolve user reports according to our <a href="https://bsky.social/about/support/community-guidelines">community guidelines</a> with several automated moderation systems. This provides a strong foundation for moderation on the app. You can read our <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/01-16-2024-moderation-2023">2023 Moderation Report</a> for more details.</p>
<p>Bluesky’s vision for moderation is a stackable ecosystem of services. Starting this week, you'll have the power to install filters from independent moderation services, layering them like building blocks on top of the Bluesky app's foundation. This allows you to create a customized experience tailored to your preferences (see example below).</p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://bsky.social/about/images/blogposts/mod-image-1.jpg" alt="An example moderation service that users can subscribe to." width="600">
  <figcaption>An example moderation service that users can subscribe to.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In the first stage of this week’s rollout, these independent moderation services filters will be available on the desktop version of the app. Soon, they’ll also be available on mobile, so you can shape your social media experience across all platforms.</p>
<p>This hybrid approach is intended to provide a cohesive experience, where our in-house moderation works in conjunction with additional layers customized to each community. The Bluesky app, as an online space that we created and maintain, will always have the foundation of the moderation we provide. Independent moderation services will let you and community builders further customize your own spaces, and open APIs will let developers evolve and innovate on these systems.</p>

  <figcaption>Example of a post that the moderation service The Chiller has labeled as “rude.”</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>One team will never be perfect at moderation and curation for the entire world, with its wide variety of contexts, cultures, and preferences. So we’re excited about opening the ecosystem to empower experts, developers, and users with local context to provide their own input that you can additionally subscribe to, on top of Bluesky’s moderation service.</p>
<p>Later this week, we will publish a technical explainer for moderation across the AT Protocol. (This blog post will be updated with a link at that time.)</p>
<h2>How will this all work?</h2>
<p>Here’s what users, moderators, and developers can expect to see this week:</p>
<h3>From a user perspective:</h3>
<p>First and foremost, we want Bluesky to be a great and intuitive experience as soon as you install the app. But if you want to customize your experience, you can easily browse and select from other independent moderation services and subscribe to them in the Bluesky app — as easily as you’d follow another account.</p>
<p>For example, someone could make a moderation service that blocks photos of spiders from Bluesky — let’s call it the Spider Shield. If you get a jump scare from seeing spiders in your otherwise peaceful nature feed, you could install this moderation service and immediately any labeled spider pictures would disappear from your experience.</p>
<p>Moderation services can also accept reports, so if you came across an unlabeled picture of a spider, you could report it to the Spider Shield for review.</p>
<h3>From a moderator perspective:</h3>
<p>If you want to offer a moderation layer on top of what the Bluesky app provides, you can do this without running a lot of infrastructure or building your own client app. We’ve built open source software to simplify the process of running a moderation service. While you need some technical know-how for now, we expect this process to get simpler over time.</p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://bsky.social/about/images/blogposts/mod_2023_ozone_ui.png" alt="Screenshot of the Ozone interface, which a team can use to inspect and label content on the network." width="600">
  <figcaption>Screenshot of the Ozone interface, which a team can use to inspect and label content on the network.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Today, you can already run a mute list or block list that other users can subscribe to. But it often gets tied to your account in a way that makes it hard to delegate responsibility to others. Once you’re running a popular blocklist, that list becomes associated with your account, and users may start directly tagging you in the app. This can get overwhelming at scale.</p>
<p>Ozone, the open source moderation labeling system we’re releasing today, lets you set up a service like a blocklist, but more nuanced — instead of just adding accounts, you can label specific posts too. You will have access to a reporting queue, and users will be able to send reports via the in-app reporting flow. You will be able to set custom labels, and specify what those labels should do. Moderation services will not be tied to individual users, and multiple people can manage them. Tooling designed for teams and communities can help take the burden off individuals and make it possible to run a sustainable moderation service.</p>
<p>To make this more concrete, let’s say you’re the creator of the previously mentioned Spider Shield labeler that labels photos of spiders. You can set up an Ozone dashboard that provides a queue of spider pictures that have been reported, reducing the need for people to tag you directly every time they find a new spider picture online. It’s customizable — you could create one kind of label that blocks pictures of real spiders, and one kind of label that blurs out illustrations of spiders. You could recruit others who don’t like spiders to help you manage the reports, and even hand the project off to someone else altogether without disrupting the people who are using it.</p>
<h3>From a developer perspective:</h3>
<p>As a developer, you've got options when it comes to labeling content. You can use our software, like Ozone, or you can apply labels directly through the API. Ozone is built to help humans review moderation reports, but you can also use automated labeling to power your moderation services. Check out Ozone's open-source repo <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/ozone-ui">here</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to set up Spider Shield as a fully automated service that uses machine learning to find and label spider pictures, you can do that without even touching Ozone, our moderation tool. And if you want to customize Ozone for your own purposes, you can <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/ozone-ui">submit a PR</a> or fork the project. Our goal in building this open source moderation tooling is to help apps in the AT Protocol ecosystem handle trust &amp; safety challenges without having to start from scratch.</p>
<p>The generic, customizable nature of labels allows you to get creative with them — it would be possible to use labels to “verify” nature accounts that don’t post pictures of spiders, for example. Although the initial functionality of labelers is intended to hide, block, or blur content, it could eventually be used for curation or verification too. We think that the atproto developer ecosystem will find even more ways to use labels and independent moderation services, and will drive innovation in how moderation works on social networks.</p>
<p>Moderation services can work across the entire atproto network, not just the Bluesky app. Imagine if someone creates a new photo-sharing app called Skygram. The Spider Shield moderation service built for Bluesky could easily be used on Skygram too. That's the power of "composable moderation" — all the pieces can be mixed and matched in tons of different ways, even across completely separate apps.</p>
<p>We think it's important for Bluesky to lay the groundwork for a great experience in the app, which is why our moderation service is the default for all Bluesky app users. But we also believe in giving users the freedom to choose and the right to leave. So if Bluesky's moderation doesn’t meet your needs and you want an altogether different experience, you can make that happen. You'll need to build or use a different client app with your own moderation service, but this option gives you full flexibility to implement your own moderation system from the ground up. However, all content shown in the Bluesky app must adhere to Bluesky’s community guidelines.</p>
<h2>FAQ</h2>
<p><strong><em>Where can I find the open-sourced Ozone tool?</em></strong></p>
<p>You can find the GitHub repository
<a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/ozone-ui">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong><em>Why are you open-sourcing Ozone?</em></strong></p>
<p>By making Ozone open-source and providing it as a ready-to-use tool for independent moderators on the AT Protocol, we're creating a system that encourages collaboration and transparency. Unlike most social media companies that develop their safety tools in private, Ozone's development will be out in the open. This means that new social apps built on the AT Protocol can benefit from all the improvements made by Bluesky and other organizations. By working together and sharing knowledge, we can create better tools faster and build a social media ecosystem that works for everyone.</p>
<p><strong><em>How is this different from community moderation on Mastodon?</em></strong></p>
<p>Moderation on Bluesky is not tied to your server, like it is on Mastodon. Defederation, a way of addressing moderation issues in Mastodon by disconnecting servers, is not as relevant on Bluesky because there are other layers to the system. Server operators can set rules for what content they will host, but tools like blocklists and moderation services are what help communities self-organize around moderation preferences. Our <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/02-22-2024-open-social-web">post on federation</a> goes into more detail on how Bluesky differs from Mastodon.</p>
<p><strong><em>What do I need to do to moderate my own community on Bluesky?</em></strong></p>
<p>All users of Bluesky’s client app are subscribed by default to Bluesky’s moderation. If you would like to run a moderation service that layers on top of these defaults, you can create a new account for that new service and get it up and running with Ozone.</p>
<p>However, if you want to opt out of our defaults, this is still possible — we believe it’s important to give users the right to leave and not lock you in. You would need to use or develop a separate client app that connects to the AT Protocol, but this option gives you full flexibility to implement your own moderation system from the ground up.</p>
<p><strong><em>How will running a moderation service be sustainable?</em></strong></p>
<p>Moderation services, much like feed generators, will likely start off as community-run projects. Just like the 40,000+ custom feeds on Bluesky, or the many Mastodon instances that exist, they may continue to operate as independent projects of individuals or organizations. However, there is also nothing stopping a moderation service from having paid subscribers.</p></div></section></div>]]></description>

<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codewhisperer/latest/userguide/command-line-getting-started-installing.html">Amazon CodeWhisperer for command line</a>.</p><p>We’re keenly aware of the impact generative AI is having on the way developers
build. We’re hard at work innovating and we have a lot of exciting new things
coming to CodeWhisperer for command line later this year. With that said, we
have decided to fully focus our efforts on these new features, and given that,
we will be sunsetting Fig on September 1, 2024.</p><p>We will continue supporting Fig until September 1. Until then, we encourage
users to migrate over to
<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codewhisperer/latest/userguide/command-line-getting-started-installing.html">CodeWhisperer for command line</a>.
To make this transition as easy as possible, users can upgrade to CodeWhisperer

offers Fig’s core features including 1) IDE-style completions for 500+ CLIs
and 2) natural language-to-bash translation. It’s free on the Individual tier
and is designed to be faster and more reliable than Fig. We have several
exciting new CodeWhisperer for command line features coming in 2024 including
support for Linux, AI chat, inline AI completions, autocomplete in SSH, and
private autocomplete.</p><p>CodeWhisperer for command line does not include features similar to Fig Scripts,

time soon.</p><h3 id="how-do-i-migrate"><a href="#how-do-i-migrate">How do I migrate?</a></h3><p>The Fig Dashboard UI will handle the migration for you — it takes just a few
minutes. The migration process exports your data to your local device, installs
CodeWhisperer for command line, transfers your settings, then uninstalls Fig.
Once the CodeWhisperer app is installed, you will be prompted to grant macOS
accessibility permissions and then login or sign up.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: You will need to be on v2.18 to see the new Fig Dashboard UI.</p><h3 id="what-happens-to-my-data"><a href="#what-happens-to-my-data">What happens to my data?</a></h3><p>Fig will delete all user data on September 1.

<p dir="auto">A program to explore how Mandelbrot set images are affected by floating point precision.</p>
<p dir="auto">Dependencies: <a href="https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_79_0/libs/multiprecision/doc/html/index.html" rel="nofollow">Boost::Multiprecision</a> (How to <a href="https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_79_0/more/getting_started/index.html" rel="nofollow">Install Boost</a> ) and <a href="https://github.com/raysan5/raylib">RayLib</a> for graphics.  Boost::Multiprecision may be easily replaced by other floating-point or rational implementations, like GiMP or GMPF by just changing the <code>#include</code>s and <code>typedef</code>s at the beginning.</p>

<p dir="auto">How much is a Mandelbrot set image affected by the floating point precision of the code used to compute it?</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>The points in a region of a Mandelbrot set image have <em>sensitive dependence upon initial conditions.</em>  (This property is the "chaos" in "chaos theory.")  A small deviation in the value of C in Z=Z^2+C can lead to a very different outcome for one point versus another point that is only a miniscule distance from it.  This fact remains true at all scales of magnification, i.e., "miniscule" can be arbitrarily small.</li>
<li>Floating point math cannot perfectly represent many rational numbers.  Moreover, floating point math can generate inaccuracies that can snowball with repeated calculations, including repeated operations of multiplication and addition.  Repeated multiplication and addition are the core of the Mandelbrot set algorithm.</li>
<li>Since the Mandelbrot set is always generated on a computer, typically using floating point math of some precision or other, we ask: How much of a Mandelbrot set image's visual complexity is due to the mathematical properties of the algorithm, and how much is due to floating point inaccuracies in its computer calculation?  Could some of the familiar visual properties of the Mandelbrot set simply be "noise" introduced by floating point calculations that have iterated thousands or even millions of times?</li>

<p dir="auto">I wrote easy-to-modify c++ code that simply uses <code>typedef</code> to allow the user to explore the Mandelbrot set and to compare how the Mandelbrot set image looks when generated using the <em>same parameters</em> on the <em>same points</em>, but using three different floating-point implementations to calculate the result.  In addition to standard <code>float</code> and <code>double</code> types, the <code>Boost::Multiprecision</code> <a href="https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_79_0/libs/multiprecision/doc/html/boost_multiprecision/tut/floats/cpp_bin_float.html" rel="nofollow">cpp_bin_float</a> class was used to implement extended-precision floating-point types of the user's choice.</p>
<p dir="auto">The program is multi-threaded so it generates the desired Mandelbrot set image in all three float types simultaneously.  Keys <code>&lt;1&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;2&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;3&gt;</code> display the image as generated by the three different types of floating point precision that the user has selected.  Keys <code>&lt;4&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;5&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;6&gt;</code> <em>subtract pairs of images</em> to highlight any pixels that are different:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>Key &lt;4&gt;</code> -- Subtracts image 1 from 2</li>
<li><code>Key &lt;5&gt;</code> -- Subtracts image 1 from 3</li>
<li><code>Key &lt;6&gt;</code> -- Subtracts image 2 from 3</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Green pixels indicate a positive value following the subtraction, red pixels a negative value.
Basic statistics of the comparison are given in console output, such as the total number of pixels that are different, the percentage of the total image that is different, and the greatest difference between the values of the pixels (which tends to be close to the max iterations that one has selected for the Mandelbrot algorithm).  The console output also prints basic information about the three types one has chosen at start-up, such as digits of precision.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">An Example</h3><a id="user-content-an-example" aria-label="Permalink: An Example" href="#an-example"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Here are some sample images from a zoom in the neighborhood of C = -0.104943 + 0.927572i. Magnification is approximately 33E+6. The distance between adjacent pixels is 1/(2^33).  Max iterations is 30K.  Here's the image generated with standard <code>double</code> (53 bits of precision):</p>

<p dir="auto">Here is the same image generated with <code>cpp_bin_float_quad</code> (113 bits of precision).  Superficially it looks largely the same:</p>

<p dir="auto">But upon subtraction, we find that 8.77% ofthe pixels are different!  92,007 out of 1,048,576 pixels have different values.  These differences include points estimated to be in the Mandelbrot Set in one image and not in the other, as well as points which exceeded the orbit boundary check (i.e., the magnitude of Z &gt; 2) in both images but at different iterations.  Here's what we get when we subtract the Quad image from the Double precision image and color-code the difference:</p>

<p dir="auto">Green pixels are where Quad &gt; Double; red pixels are where Double &gt; Quad.</p>

<p dir="auto">Press <code>Key &lt;7&gt;</code> with the mouse over a pixel in screen views 1, 2 or 3 to trigger Four-Screen view.  Top left and right are float types 1 and 2.  Bottom left is the difference between them.  The bottom right screen displays the trajectory of the point against the background of the whole Mandelbrot set.  The first float type is plotted in blue, the second in red, the third in yellow.  This allows you to see how different floating point implementations lead to different trajectories, which lead to different final values for a single point in the image.</p>

<p dir="auto">Press <code>Key &lt;8&gt;</code> to see the trajectory screen by itself.  In this display mode, the background remains that of the zoomed-in image, rather than the whole Mandelbrot set, but the screen coordinates of the trajectories are still (-2-2i) to (2+2i).  Leaving the background image of the zoomed-in fractal better allows you to select a point where trajectories clearly diverge, which are often near the edges of the set or other high-chaos areas.</p>

<p dir="auto">The three floating point types are <code>typedef</code>ed as <code>first_float</code>, <code>second_float</code> and <code>third_float</code> throughout the code.  Variable names also have these names as suffixes.  Yes, templated code would be more elegant than coding everything in triplicate!  I began with templated code, but finding the proper arguments to pass to <code>std::asynch</code> for templated overloaded functions proved too hard.</p>
<p dir="auto">Places to customize your settings are preceded by the comment tag <code>// OPTION</code>, for which string you can search.  The basic options are below.  The first setting is the most important: selecting your floating point types.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Set your types</h3><a id="user-content-set-your-types" aria-label="Permalink: Set your types" href="#set-your-types"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Alter these three lines in the code to choose your own floating point implementations and <em>voila!</em> You are all set to go.  It will be helpful to order your types from the least precise for <code>first_float</code> to the most precise for <code>third_float</code>.</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="typedef double first_float;
typedef cpp_bin_float_quad second_float;
typedef cpp_bin_float_oct third_float;"><pre><code>typedef double first_float;
typedef cpp_bin_float_quad second_float;
typedef cpp_bin_float_oct third_float;
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Tweak your multi-threading preferences (optional)</h3><a id="user-content-tweak-your-multi-threading-preferences-optional" aria-label="Permalink: Tweak your multi-threading preferences (optional)" href="#tweak-your-multi-threading-preferences-optional"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Depending on how many cores you have you may wish to change <code>unsigned int numThreads;</code> This setting creates <code>numThreads</code> <em>for each of the three floating point types</em>.  So <code>unsigned int numThreads=4;</code> will start 12 threads initially.  Built-in types (like <code>float</code>, <code>double,</code> <code>long double</code>) go much faster on most platforms because of intrinsic processor support.  So threads dedicated to those types will finish far sooner than those using  <code>Boost::multiprecision</code>'s <code>cpp_bin_float</code> types.  Software-emulated floating-point support is always slower.  That's why they invented FPUs.</p>
<p dir="auto">Each thread calculates a batch of pixels at a time.  You can tweak the amount per batch here:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="unsigned int batchSize_first_float=10240;
unsigned int batchSize_second_float=2048;
unsigned int batchSize_third_float=512;"><pre><code>unsigned int batchSize_first_float=10240;
unsigned int batchSize_second_float=2048;
unsigned int batchSize_third_float=512;
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Choosing a built-in type like <code>double</code> for the <code>first_float</code> type, and asigning it a large number of pixels per batch (like 10K above), can be useful to display an image quickly on screen 1 to help perfect your center and zoom.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Tweak how your starting point is calculated (optional)</h3><a id="user-content-tweak-how-your-starting-point-is-calculated-optional" aria-label="Permalink: Tweak how your starting point is calculated (optional)" href="#tweak-how-your-starting-point-is-calculated-optional"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Every pixel on the screen has X and Y coordinates (ranging 0-1023) which correspond to some point on the complex plane and constitute the value of C in the formula Z=Z^2+C.  Presuming that your floating point types range from least precise (for <code>first_float</code>) to most precise, as you zoom deeper, the calculation of C will begin to be affected by the precision of your floating point types, beginning with <code>first_float</code> losing precision in its last decimal places.  You can choose whether to start iterating with a value for C that is calculated separately for each type, in its own precision, which may lead to slightly different values for C.  Or you can start iterating with the exact same value for C for all types by simply casting the value for C in <code>first_float</code> into the higher-precision types.  The latter approach can highlight differences in value due solely to floating-point inaccuracy accumulated through iteration.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Basic program controls</h2><a id="user-content-basic-program-controls" aria-label="Permalink: Basic program controls" href="#basic-program-controls"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The <strong>mouse left-click</strong> is used to recenter the image; keys are used for everything else.  Recentering and zooming takes a few seconds for the screen to reset.  The GUI interface is functional but not as pretty or convenient as professional programs.  This tool is made for research.  Get Ultrafractal or Kalles Fraktaler to make beautiful images easily.  My color palette is ugly as sin.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Period</strong> - Zooms in by a factor of two</li>
<li><strong>Comma</strong> - Zooms out by a factor of two.</li>
<li><strong>Semi-colon</strong> - Zooms in by a factor of eight.  These are the only zoom controls.</li>
<li><strong>M, K, O</strong> - Increase max iterations by 1, 10 or 100, respectively.  <strong>Shift+O</strong> increases to the nearest whole 1000.</li>
<li><strong>N, J, I</strong> - Decrease max iterations by 1, 10 or 100, respectively.  <strong>Shift+I</strong> decreases by 1000.</li>
<li><strong>P</strong> - Pause calculation toggle.  This waits for existing threads to complete and then waits for unpause to spawn new ones, so its effect is not instant if you are working on some computationally intensive threads which must finish first.  Keep your batch sizes small for responsiveness.</li>
<li><strong>U</strong> - Unpause.  Doesn't toggle.</li>
<li><strong>R</strong> - Revert to prior coordinates for image center.  Works once.</li>

<p><strong>Irvine, Calif., March 12, 2024</strong> <strong>— </strong>Scientists know relatively little about particles released into the air when a vehicle driver brakes, though evidence suggests those particles may be more harmful to health than particles exiting the tailpipe.</p>



<p>In a new study in <em><a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2313897121">Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</a></em>, University of California, Irvine researchers show how most of these particles emitted during light braking carry an electric charge – something that could potentially be exploited to help reduce air pollution from vehicles.</p>



<p>“We found that up to 80% of aerosol particles emitted from braking are electrically charged, and that many of them are in fact highly charged,” saidAdam Thomas, a doctoral candidate in the lab of Jim Smith, professor of chemistry, who led the study alongside UCI postdoctoral researcher Paulus Bauer.</p>



<p>To do the work, the team used a large lathe to spin a detached brake rotor and caliper. They then measured the electric charge of the aerosols emitted into the air and discovered the 80 percent figure.</p>



<p>“I was very surprised,” said Smith. “We were also surprised that this has not really been studied given how common cars are in human societies.”</p>



<p>The research is part of a broader team effort at UCI to understand the public health impacts of non-tailpipe emissions in areas beset by car traffic, including many areas in Southern California.</p>



<p>“The toxicity and health effects of brake wear particles are largely unknown,” said Manabu Shiraiwa, professor of aerosol chemistry at UCI and one of the researchers behind the university-wide project. “Recent results from my lab indicate that they may induce oxidative stress, but more research is needed.”</p>



<p>The new study reveals a problem that may grow as electric cars become more and more common over the next several decades. Electric cars, Smith explained, are not truly zero-emission vehicles, so municipalities need to think about strategies to reduce emissions from brake use as well as tailpipes.</p>



<p>The team found that the percentage of charged particles emitted largely depended on the material makeup of brake pads. Because the particles carry an electric charge, this should make it relatively easy to remove from the air.</p>



<p>“If they are charged, they can be removed easily from the air before they have a chance to have an impact at all on health,” said Smith. “All you would need to do is to collect them with an electrostatic precipitator – a device that exposes the charged particles to an electric field and efficiently sweeps them away.”</p>



<p>The public health risk posed by brake emissions is not borne equally by a population – lower-income parts of cities tend to be more traffic-heavy than others, which creates an environmental justice issue wherein certain socioeconomic classes are more exposed to brake emissions than others.</p>



<p>According to Professor Barbara Finlayson-Pitts, Distinguished Emeritus Professor of chemistry and the principal investigator of the project at UCI, emissions from braking are not well-characterized but are potentially significant in high-traffic areas. “These areas are often in poorer communities and highlight an important aspect of environmental justice that has been largely overlooked,” Finlayson-Pitts said.</p>



<p>The UCI team is working with local community organizations like the Madison Park Neighborhood Association in Santa Ana, which is helping disseminate UCI’s scientific findings to the public. Funding for the study came from fees paid by Volkswagen as part of a 2016 settlement reached with the California Department of Justice, which found that the company used devices that contributed to increased air pollution.</p>

   <p>Police in Charleston, S.C., are investigating the death of John Barnett, a former Boeing quality control manager who became a whistleblower when he went public with his concerns about serious safety issues in the company's commercial airplanes.</p>   <p>Barnett's body was found in a vehicle in a Holiday Inn parking lot in Charleston on Saturday, police said. One day earlier, he testified about the string of problems he says he identified at Boeing's plant where he once helped inspect the 787 aircraft before delivery to customers.</p>   
   
   
<!-- END ID="RES1238040111" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>Police said officers were sent to the hotel to conduct a welfare check after people were unable to contact Barnett, who had traveled to Charleston to testify in his lawsuit against Boeing. </p>   <p>"Upon their arrival, officers discovered a male inside a vehicle suffering from a gunshot wound to the head," police said in a statement sent to NPR. "He was pronounced deceased at the scene."</p>   <p>The office of Charleston County Coroner Bobbi Jo O'Neal said that Barnett, who had been living in Louisiana after retiring from Boeing, died "from what appears to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound." </p>   <p>Charleston police said detectives are actively investigating the case and are awaiting a formal cause of death as they try to determine the circumstances surrounding Barnett's death.</p>   <p>Barnett, who spent decades working for Boeing at its plants in Everett, Wash., and North Charleston, S.C., had repeatedly alleged that Boeing's manufacturing practices had declined — and that rather than improve them, he added, managers had pressured workers not to document potential defects and problems. </p>   <p>"We are saddened by Mr. Barnett's passing, and our thoughts are with his family and friends," Boeing said in a statement sent to NPR.</p>   <p>Barnett, 62, made international headlines in April of 2019 when he and other former Boeing employees <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/20/business/boeing-dreamliner-production-problems.html">spoke to The New York Times</a> about what he called shoddy manufacturing problems at Boeing. Barnett accused the company of adopting a culture that prioritized raw numbers and profits over quality — and by extension, passenger safety. </p>   
   
<!-- END ID="RES1238040572" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>"As a quality manager at Boeing, you're the last line of defense before a defect makes it out to the flying public," Barnett told the newspaper. "And I haven't seen a plane out of Charleston yet that I'd put my name on saying it's safe and airworthy."</p>   <p>By the time the article appeared, Barnett had already filed a whistleblower complaint against Boeing, saying that his attempts to raise quality and safety problems had been ignored and that he was punished for continuing to flag them.</p>   
   
<!-- END ID="RES1238041466" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>Barnett filed a whistleblower complaint against Boeing in early 2017; his case against the company was heading toward a trial this June, his family said. </p>   <p>"He was looking forward to having his day in court and hoped that it would force Boeing to change its culture," the family said in a statement shared with NPR by his brother, Rodney Barnett.</p>   <p>The family says Barnett's health declined because of the stresses of taking a stand against his longtime employer.</p>   <p>"He was suffering from PTSD and anxiety attacks as a result of being subjected to the hostile work environment at Boeing," they said, "which we believe led to his death."</p>   
   <p>When John Barnett was interviewed by Ralph Nader <a href="https://www.ralphnaderradiohour.com/p/boeing-787-dreamliner-hundreds-of-fdf#details">in 2019</a>, he said health issues had persisted after he retired from the plane-maker.</p>   <p>"It's taken a serious mental and emotional toll on me," Barnett said — but, he added, the safety of the airplanes rolling off the production line remained his main focus. </p>   <p>"That's what my story is about, is telling my story enough to where the right people get involved to make sure that these airplanes are made correctly," Barnett said. "Because the 787 carries 288 passengers plus crew. So the last thing I want to do is wake up in the morning and see a 787 has gone down" because of one of the problems he identified.  </p>   <p>"I mean, it's just, it keeps me up at night," he said.</p>

    <tr></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td><div><p>Hi everyone! We're building an AI-enabled editor (<a href="https://glide.agenticlabs.com/">https://glide.agenticlabs.com</a>) that helps developers write technical design docs faster. It’s like an IDE with Copilot, but instead of directly editing your code, it helps you come up with a solid plan before implementing a change. There’s a basic demo here (<a href="https://youtu.be/5uEapdT6nYE" rel="nofollow">https://youtu.be/5uEapdT6nYE</a>), and we also recorded a session with one of our early users running through an unusual task (calling a Fortran algorithm from Go, <a href="https://youtu.be/ppluB0Z1OIA" rel="nofollow">https://youtu.be/ppluB0Z1OIA</a>)</p><p>Why use design docs? Mainly because on complex software projects, if you don’t have a careful strategy, a few lines of code can lead to a ripple effect across the whole codebase. You're working on a small new feature and suddenly, your PR is touching dozens of different files in a handful of directories, and you may be questioning if it still makes sense at all.</p><p>Laying out your approach in a technical design document helps to avoid these situations, so tech companies often embed this practice in their engineering culture. Unfortunately, producing these write-ups is a manual and time-consuming process that keeps you switching between typing in Confluence, searching on GitHub, and drawing on a whiteboard.</p><p>For example, one of our early users is building a RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) system in Rust, and needs to rewrite their original chunking algorithm that was created in Python. A change like that involves not only porting the chunking logic but also defining new structs, choosing the Rust libraries for text parsing, re-integrating with the Rust server, and changing the endpoint on the front end. Simple-sounding changes like these can end up with many "tentacles" devs have to work through. Our product helps teams like this spec out their approach more quickly.</p><p>The need for this hit us when we were working on a product using LLMs to turn tickets into PRs. You can just assign a ticket to GPT-4 and review the PR, right? Turns out that most people (including us) don’t write very complete or specific tickets on the first pass, and when they do, that ends up being more effort than just doing the whole thing yourself.</p><p>What was missing was a fast way to iterate on goals, requirements, and implementation plans for code that could then be useful to developers (whether AI assisted or not) to implement with high confidence. Our editor, Glide, splits this process into the following stages and lets you spend as much or as little time on each stage as makes sense.</p><p>(1) We index your project code with Tree-Sitter and make it searchable, so you can add relevant parts of the codebase to the task context.</p><p>(2) AI writes the first pass for a high-level solution outline given the code and the goal. It will try to point out missing details or ambiguities about the task so far.</p><p>(3) As a developer you can easily edit the generated content—tweaks like “change step 3” or “remove the part about caching” don’t require additional back-and-forth conversation.</p><p>(4) The next stage is a step-by-step plan—a pseudocode-level guide for how to complete the change. AI generates this, and again you can make adjustments in-line as needed.</p><p>(5) There is a chat mode for deeper discussions about the content—just highlight any text and click chat.

<h2 id="why-swift">Why Swift?</h2>

<p>Swift is widely known as the modern language for app development on Apple devices. However, over the course of its first decade, it has grown into a versatile, multi-platform language targeting use cases where you’d otherwise find C or C++.</p>

<p>Personally, I have come to appreciate Swift’s emphasis on memory safety and great ergonomics, and want these traits for embedded systems where reliability and security are critically important.</p>

<p>But embedded systems are not only found in mission-critical applications. Some are actually all fun and <em>games</em>.</p>

<h3 id="playdate-by-panic">Playdate by Panic</h3>

<p>Over the holiday season, I read about building Playdate games in C and became curious if the same was possible in Swift. For those unfamiliar with Playdate, it is a tiny handheld game system built by Panic, creators of popular apps and games like “Transmit,” “Nova,” “Firewatch,” “Untitled Goose Game,” and more. It houses a Cortex M7 processor, a 400 by 240 1-bit display, and has a small runtime for hosting games. Additionally, Panic provides an <a href="https://play.date/dev/">SDK</a> for building games in both C and Lua.</p>

<p>While most Playdate games are written in Lua for ease of development, they can run into performance problems that necessitate the added complexity of using C. Swift’s combination of high-level ergonomics with low-level performance, as well as its strong support for interoperating with C, make it seem like a good match for the Playdate. However, the typical Swift application and runtime exceed the device’s tight resource constraints.</p>

<p>Regardless, I still wanted to create a game in Swift and I had good idea for the approach.</p>

<h3 id="the-embedded-language-mode">The Embedded Language Mode</h3>

<p>Recently, the Swift project began developing a new embedded language mode to support highly constrained platforms. This mode utilizes generic specialization, inlining, and dead code stripping to produce tiny binaries, while retaining the core features of Swift.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: The embedded language mode is actively evolving and is helping drive the development of language features such as: <a href="https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0390-noncopyable-structs-and-enums.md">non-copyable types</a>, <a href="https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0413-typed-throws.md">typed throws</a>, etc. It is available now in <a href="https://www.swift.org/download/">nightly toolchains</a> and if you’re curious to learn more, check out the <a href="https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/visions/embedded-swift.md">Vision for Embedded Swift</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These defining characteristics make the embedded language mode a great solution for shrinking Swift to fit the Playdate’s constraints.</p>

<p>With the embedded Swift language mode in hand, I got to work.</p>

<h2 id="the-games">The Games</h2>

<p>I wrote two small games in Swift for the Playdate. The first game is a port of the Playdate SDK sample of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Conway’s Game of Life</a> into Swift:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.swift.org/assets/images/2024-03-12-byte-sized-swift-tiny-games-playdate/playdate-simulator-still-life.png" alt="A screenshot of the Playdate Simulator running Conway’s Game of Life."></p>

<p>This game is one Swift file that builds directly against the Playdate C API and does not require dynamic memory allocation. The packaged game clocks in at 788 bytes, slightly smaller than the C example, which is 904 bytes.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>wc</span> <span>-c</span> &lt; <span>$REPO_ROOT</span>/Examples/Life/Life.pdx/pdex.bin
     788

<span>$ </span><span>wc</span> <span>-c</span> &lt; <span>$HOME</span>/Developer/PlaydateSDK/C_API/Examples/GameOfLife.pdx/pdex.bin
     904
</code></pre></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: Both versions could likely be made smaller, but I did not try to optimize code size.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The second game is a paddle-and-ball style game named “Swift Break.”</p>

<p><img src="https://www.swift.org/assets/images/2024-03-12-byte-sized-swift-tiny-games-playdate/playdate-simulator-still-swiftbreak.png" alt="A screenshot of the Playdate Simulator with the Swift Break splash screen."></p>

<p>Swift Break uses the same high-level language features you’d find in desktop and server applications, such as <a href="https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/enumerations/#Associated-Values">enums with associated values</a>, <a href="https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/generics">generic types and functions</a>, and <a href="https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/memorysafety">automatic memory management</a> to simplify game development while retaining C-level performance.</p>

<p>For example, here’s the core game logic for handling ball bounces:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>sprite</span><span>.</span><span>moveWithCollisions</span><span>(</span><span>goalX</span><span>:</span> <span>newX</span><span>,</span> <span>goalY</span><span>:</span> <span>newY</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> <span>_</span><span>,</span> <span>_</span><span>,</span> <span>collisions</span> <span>in</span>
  <span>for</span> <span>collision</span> <span>in</span> <span>collisions</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>otherSprite</span> <span>=</span> <span>Sprite</span><span>(</span><span>borrowing</span><span>:</span> <span>collision</span><span>.</span><span>other</span><span>)</span>

    <span>// If we hit a visible brick, remove it.</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>otherSprite</span><span>.</span><span>tag</span> <span>==</span> <span>.</span><span>brick</span><span>,</span> <span>otherSprite</span><span>.</span><span>isVisible</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>otherSprite</span><span>.</span><span>removeSprite</span><span>()</span>
      <span>activeGame</span><span>.</span><span>bricksRemaining</span> <span>-=</span> <span>1</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>var</span> <span>normal</span> <span>=</span> <span>Vector</span><span>(</span><span>collision</span><span>.</span><span>normal</span><span>)</span>

    <span>if</span> <span>otherSprite</span><span>.</span><span>tag</span> <span>==</span> <span>.</span><span>paddle</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>// Compute deflection angle (radians) for the normal in domain</span>
      <span>// -pi/6 to pi/6.</span>
      <span>let</span> <span>placement</span> <span>=</span> <span>placement</span><span>(</span><span>of</span><span>:</span> <span>collision</span><span>,</span> <span>along</span><span>:</span> <span>otherSprite</span><span>)</span>
      <span>let</span> <span>deflectionAngle</span> <span>=</span> <span>placement</span> <span>*</span> <span>(</span><span>.</span><span>pi</span> <span>/</span> <span>6</span><span>)</span>
      <span>normal</span><span>.</span><span>rotate</span><span>(</span><span>by</span><span>:</span> <span>deflectionAngle</span><span>)</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>activeGame</span><span>.</span><span>ballVelocity</span><span>.</span><span>reflect</span><span>(</span><span>along</span><span>:</span> <span>normal</span><span>)</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>It calls a <code>moveWithCollisions</code> method to move the ball, iterating through a collection of objects the ball bounced off of while moving.</p>

<p>Swift Break features a splash screen, a pause menu, paddle-location-based bounce physics, infinite levels, a game over screen, and allows you to control the paddle with either the D-Pad or the Crank!</p>

<h2 id="try-it-out">Try it Out</h2>

<p>If you’re eager to use Swift on your Playdate, the <a href="https://github.com/apple/swift-playdate-examples">swift-playdate-examples</a> repository has you covered. It contains the above ready-to-use examples that demonstrate how to build Swift games for the Playdate, both for the simulator and the hardware.</p>

<p>Additionally, the repository includes detailed documentation to guide you through the setup process. Whether you’re a seasoned developer or just starting, you’ll find the necessary resources to bring your ideas to life.</p>

<p>But if you’re up for a deep dive into the technical details of what it takes to bring Swift to a new platform, read on!</p>

<h2 id="deep-dive-bringing-swift-to-the-playdate">Deep Dive: Bringing Swift to the Playdate</h2>

<p>Bringing up a new platform is always fraught with challenges and infuriating bugs. Everything is broken with numerous false starts, until you clear the last bug, and then it all comes together. Getting Swift games running on the Playdate was no different.</p>

<p>My general approach was to leverage Swift’s interoperability to build on top of the Playdate C SDK. The good news is that the Swift toolchain already had all the features I needed to get this working. I just had to figure out how to put them together. Here’s an overview of the path I took:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Building object files for the Playdate Simulator</li>
  <li>Importing the Playdate C API</li>
  <li>Running on the Simulator</li>
  <li>Running on the Hardware</li>
  <li>Improving the API with Swift</li>
  <li>Completing Swift Break</li>
</ul>

<p>Without further ado, let’s get started.</p>

<h3 id="building-object-files-for-the-playdate-simulator">Building object files for the Playdate Simulator</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: The commands mentioned below were run with a Swift nightly toolchain installed and have the <code>TOOLCHAINS</code> environment variable set to the name of the toolchain.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My first step was compiling an object file for the Playdate Simulator. The simulator works by dynamically loading host libraries, so I needed to build the object files for the host’s platform and architecture (the so-called <em>triple</em> in compiler-speak), which <code>swiftc</code> does by default. The only additional flags I needed were for enabling embedded Swift and code optimizations.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>cat </span>test.swift
<span>let </span>value <span>=</span> 1

<span>$ </span><span>mkdir </span>build

<span>$ </span>swiftc <span>-c</span> test.swift <span>-o</span> build/test.o <span>\</span>
    <span>-Osize</span> <span>-wmo</span> <span>-enable-experimental-feature</span> Embedded

<span>$ </span>file build/test.o
test.o: Mach-O 64-bit object arm64
</code></pre></div>

<h3 id="importing-the-playdate-c-api">Importing the Playdate C API</h3>

<p>The next step was compiling against the Playdate C API from Swift. This was straightforward due to the structure of the Playdate C header files and Swift’s native support for interoperating with C.</p>

<p>I started by locating the Playdate C header files:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>ls</span> <span>$HOME</span>/Developer/PlaydateSDK/C_API/
Examples     buildsupport pd_api       pd_api.h

<span>$ </span><span>ls</span> <span>$HOME</span>/Developer/PlaydateSDK/C_API/
pd_api_display.h     pd_api_gfx.h         pd_api_lua.h         pd_api_sound.h       pd_api_sys.h
pd_api_file.h        pd_api_json.h        pd_api_scoreboards.h pd_api_sprite.h
</code></pre></div>

<p>And used an “include search path” (<code>-I</code>) to tell the Swift compiler’s C interoperability feature where to find them. I additionally needed to pass a “define” (<code>-D</code>) to tell the compiler how to parse the header files:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$ </span>swiftc ... <span>-Xcc</span> <span>-I</span> <span>-Xcc</span> <span>$HOME</span>/Developer/PlaydateSDK/C_API/ <span>-Xcc</span> <span>-DTARGET_EXTENSION</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Next, I created a <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/Modules.html#module-maps">module map file</a> to wrap the headers into an importable module from Swift:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>cat</span> <span>$HOME</span>/Developer/PlaydateSDK/C_API/module.modulemap
module CPlaydate <span>[</span>system] <span>{</span>
  umbrella header <span>"pd_api.h"</span>
  <span>export</span> <span>*</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>And used an “import search path” (<code>-I</code>) to tell the Swift compiler where to find the CPlaydate module:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$ </span>swiftc ... <span>-I</span> <span>$HOME</span>/Developer/PlaydateSDK/C_API/
</code></pre></div>

<p>Lastly, I made a minimal “library” using the Playdate C API from Swift and compiled using the flags above:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>cat </span>test.swift
import CPlaydate
<span>let </span>pd: UnsafePointer&lt;PlaydateAPI&gt;? <span>=</span> nil

<span>$ </span><span>mkdir </span>build

<span>$ </span>swiftc <span>\</span>
    <span>-c</span> test.swift <span>\</span>
    <span>-o</span> build/test.o <span>\</span>
    <span>-Osize</span> <span>-wmo</span> <span>-enable-experimental-feature</span> Embedded <span>\</span>
    <span>-Xcc</span> <span>-I</span> <span>-Xcc</span> <span>$HOME</span>/Developer/PlaydateSDK/C_API/ <span>\</span>
    <span>-Xcc</span> <span>-DTARGET_EXTENSION</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>-I</span> <span>$HOME</span>/Developer/PlaydateSDK/C_API/

<span>$ </span>file build/test.o
test.o: Mach-O 64-bit object arm64
</code></pre></div>

<h3 id="running-on-the-simulator">Running on the Simulator</h3>

<p>Once I was able to use the Playdate C API from Swift, I ported the Conway’s Game of Life example included in the Playdate SDK to Swift, referencing <a href="https://sdk.play.date/2.2.0/Inside%20Playdate%20with%20C.html">Inside Playdate with C</a> frequently to familiarize myself with the API.</p>

<p>The C implementation of Conway’s strictly operates on Playdate OS-vended frame buffers and uses the display as game state, removing the need for separate data structures and dynamic allocations. As a result, the porting process was very mechanical because the bit manipulation and pointer operations in the C example have direct Swift analogs:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>static</span> <span>inline</span> <span>int</span> <span>val</span><span>(</span><span>uint8_t</span><span>*</span> <span>row</span><span>,</span> <span>int</span> <span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>1</span> <span>-</span> <span>((</span><span>row</span><span>[</span><span>x</span><span>/</span><span>8</span><span>]</span> <span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>(</span><span>7</span> <span>-</span> <span>(</span><span>x</span><span>%</span><span>8</span><span>)))</span> <span>&amp;</span> <span>1</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>static</span> <span>inline</span> <span>int</span> <span>ison</span><span>(</span><span>uint8_t</span><span>*</span> <span>row</span><span>,</span> <span>int</span> <span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>!</span><span>(</span><span>row</span><span>[</span><span>x</span><span>/</span><span>8</span><span>]</span> <span>&amp;</span> <span>(</span><span>0x80</span> <span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>(</span><span>x</span><span>%</span><span>8</span><span>)));</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>Row</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>var</span> <span>buffer</span><span>:</span> <span>UnsafeMutablePointer</span><span>&lt;</span><span>UInt8</span><span>&gt;</span>

  <span>}</span>

  <span>func</span> <span>isOn</span><span>(</span><span>at</span> <span>column</span><span>:</span> <span>Int32</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>I built the source into a dynamic library and used <code>pdc</code> (the Playdate compiler) to wrap the final <code>dylib</code> into a <code>pdx</code> (Playdate executable).</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$ </span>swiftc <span>\</span>
    <span>-emit-library</span> test.swift <span>\</span>
    <span>-o</span> build/pdex.dylib <span>\</span>
    ...

<span>$ </span>file build/pdex.dylib
pdex.dylib: Mach-O 64-bit dynamically linked shared library arm64

<span>$ $HOME</span>/Developer/PlaydateSDK/bin/pdc build Test

<span>$ </span><span>ls </span>Test.pdx
pdex.dylib pdxinfo
</code></pre></div>

<p>I opened my game file <code>Test.pdx</code> using the Playdate simulator and as you might expect, it worked on the first try … just kidding, it crashed!</p>

<p>After some debugging, I realized the <code>Makefile</code> used to compile the C example included an additional file <code>setup.c</code> from the SDK containing the symbol <code>_eventHandlerShim</code> needed to bootstrap the game. If this symbol is not present in the binary, the Simulator falls back to bootstrapping the game using the symbol <code>_eventHandler</code> which my binary did contain, but meant my game skipped an important setup step.</p>

<p>So, I compiled <code>setup.c</code> into an object file using <code>clang</code>, linked it into my dynamic library, re-ran, and voila! I had Conway’s Game of Life written in Swift running on the Playdate Simulator.</p>

<h3 id="running-on-the-hardware">Running on the Hardware</h3>

<p>After successfully running on the simulator, I wanted to run the game on real hardware. A colleague graciously allowed me to borrow their Playdate and I began hacking away.</p>

<p>I started by matching the triple used by the C examples for the device and seeing what happened.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$ </span>swiftc ... <span>-target</span> armv7em-none-none-eabi
&lt;module-includes&gt;:1:10: note: <span>in </span>file included from &lt;module-includes&gt;:1:
<span>#include "pd_api.h"</span>
         ^
<span>$HOME</span>/Developer/PlaydateSDK/C_API/pd_api.h:13:10: error: <span>'stdlib.h'</span> file not found
<span>#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;</span>
         ^
</code></pre></div>

<p>These errors did not previously occur because I was targeting the host machine and used the host headers for the C standard library. I considered using the same host headers for the target device, but didn’t want to debug platform incompatibilities. Little did I know, I would have to do this regardless.</p>

<p>Instead, I decided to follow the route used by the C example programs which leverage the libc headers from a <code>gcc</code> toolchain installed with the Playdate SDK. I copied the include paths used by the C examples and re-ran the compile.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>mkdir </span>build

</code></pre></div>

<p>The compile succeeded and I had an object file for the real hardware. I went through similar steps to link and package the object file into a <code>pdx</code>, using <code>clang</code> as the linker driver.</p>

<p>I deployed the game onto a Playdate, and … it crashed.</p>

<p>For some reason, when the frame-update function pointer was called, the game would crash! Debugging this issue was confusing at first, but due to past experience deploying Swift onto a Cortex M7, I realized I likely had a calling convention mismatch. I added a compiler flag <code>-Xfrontend -experimental-platform-c-calling-convention=arm_aapcs_vfp</code> to try to match the calling convention used by the Playdate OS.</p>

<p>Once again, I deployed my game to the Playdate and … it actually worked! You can see the game in action below:</p>

<video title="A video of Conway's Game of Life running on Playdate hardware mirrored to a Mac." autoplay="" loop="" muted="">

</video>

<p>I then integrated my manual compilation steps into the Makefiles found in the Playdate SDK, going through a number of options before landing on the final solution found in <code>swift-playdate-examples</code>. The result of this effort was a single <code>make</code> command to build a <code>pdx</code> compatible with both the simulator and hardware!</p>

<p>After porting Conway’s Game of Life, I began a more ambitious project: a paddle-and-ball style game named Swift Break. However, I quickly encountered friction using the raw Playdate C API directly in Swift. In typical programming fashion, I took a detour to work on the API’s ergonomics instead of the game! At this point, I had also piqued the interest of some colleagues who contributed further improvements.</p>

<p>One hurdle was the naming conventions of the imported API. In C, enum cases are often prefixed with their type’s name to prevent programmers from inadvertently mixing unrelated enum instances and case constants. However, in Swift, such prefixes are unnecessary as the compiler type-checks comparisons to ensure the correct cases are used.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Swift already provides tools for addressing this precise issue, known as <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/APINotes.html">API notes</a>. I added an API notes file to the Playdate SDK and renamed enum cases with more idiomatic Swift names:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>// Before</span>
<span>if</span> <span>event</span> <span>==</span> <span>kEventPause</span> <span>{</span> <span>...</span> <span>}</span>

<span>// After</span>
<span>if</span> <span>event</span> <span>==</span> <span>.</span><span>pause</span> <span>{</span> <span>...</span> <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>A bigger issue, however, was the lack of nullability annotations in the C API. This meant the generated code had redundant null checks everywhere, bloating code size and hurting performance. While I usually would have used API notes to add the missing annotations, this was not possible. The C API uses structs with function pointers as a “vtable”, and unfortunately, these are not currently modifiable with API notes. Due to this incompatibility, I had to adopt a suboptimal solution: pervasively using <code>Optional.unsafelyUnwrapped</code> throughout the Swift code.</p>

<p>Although this approach eliminated the null checks, it dramatically hurt readability:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>// C API in Swift with redundant null checks</span>
<span>let</span> <span>spritePointer</span> <span>=</span> <span>playdate_api</span><span>.</span><span>pointee</span><span>.</span><span>sprite</span><span>.</span><span>pointee</span><span>.</span><span>newSprite</span><span>()</span>

<span>// C API in Swift without redundant null checks</span>
<span>let</span> <span>spritePointer</span> <span>=</span> <span>playdate_api</span><span>.</span><span>unsafelyUnwrapped</span><span>.</span><span>pointee</span><span>.</span><span>sprite</span><span>.</span><span>unsafelyUnwrapped</span><span>.</span><span>pointee</span><span>.</span><span>newSprite</span><span>.</span><span>unsafelyUnwrapped</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>To address the readability issues, I created a thin Swift overlay on top of the C API. I wrapped function pointer accesses into static and instance methods on Swift types and converted function get/set pairs to Swift properties. Creating a sprite became much more intuitive and introduced zero overhead on top of the equivalent imported C calls.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>var</span> <span>sprite</span> <span>=</span> <span>Sprite</span><span>(</span><span>bitmapPath</span><span>:</span> <span>"background.png"</span><span>)</span>
<span>sprite</span><span>.</span><span>collisionsEnabled</span> <span>=</span> <span>false</span>
<span>sprite</span><span>.</span><span>zIndex</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span>
<span>sprite</span><span>.</span><span>addSprite</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Colleagues further improved the overlay by abstracting Playdate APIs requiring manual memory management to be automatically handled. An excellent example is the C API’s <a href="https://sdk.play.date/2.2.0/Inside%20Playdate%20with%20C.html#f-sprite.moveWithCollisions"><code>moveWithCollisions</code></a> function, which returns a buffer of <code>SpriteCollisionInfo</code> structs that must be freed by the caller. Using the overlay allowed us to avoid manually deallocating the buffer and made the API easier to use:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>// moveWithCollisions without the overlay</span>
<span>var</span> <span>count</span><span>:</span> <span>Int32</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span>
<span>var</span> <span>actualX</span><span>:</span> <span>Int32</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span>
<span>var</span> <span>actualY</span><span>:</span> <span>Int32</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span>
<span>let</span> <span>collisionsStartAddress</span> <span>=</span> <span>playdate_api</span><span>.</span><span>pointee</span><span>.</span><span>sprite</span><span>.</span><span>pointee</span><span>.</span><span>moveWithCollisions</span><span>(</span><span>sprite</span><span>,</span> <span>10</span><span>,</span> <span>10</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>actualX</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>actualY</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>count</span><span>)</span>
<span>let</span> <span>collisions</span> <span>=</span> <span>UnsafeBufferPointer</span><span>(</span><span>start</span><span>:</span> <span>collisionsStartAddress</span><span>,</span> <span>count</span><span>:</span> <span>count</span><span>)</span>
<span>defer</span> <span>{</span> <span>collisions</span><span>.</span><span>deallocate</span><span>()</span> <span>}</span>
<span>for</span> <span>collision</span> <span>in</span> <span>collisions</span> <span>{</span> <span>...</span> <span>}</span>

<span>// moveWithCollisions with the overlay</span>
<span>sprite</span><span>.</span><span>moveWithCollisions</span><span>(</span><span>goalX</span><span>:</span> <span>10</span><span>,</span> <span>goalY</span><span>:</span> <span>10</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> <span>actualX</span><span>,</span> <span>actualY</span><span>,</span> <span>collisions</span> <span>in</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>collision</span> <span>in</span> <span>collisions</span> <span>{</span> <span>...</span> <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>These improvements dramatically streamlined writing code for the Playdate. Additionally, as Swift’s support for ownership and non-copyable types improves, I anticipate even more ergonomic representations of the C APIs without language overhead.</p>

<h3 id="completing-swift-break">Completing Swift Break</h3>

<p>Equipped with a refined Swift Playdate API, I returned to developing Swift Break.</p>

<p>I nailed down the basics pretty quickly, but couldn’t resist adding extra features just for the fun of it. One of the highlights was implementing basic logic to deflect ball bounces based on the location where the ball and paddle collide.</p>

<p>This feature required calculating a normal vector relative to a hypothetical curve representing a rounded paddle and then reflecting the ball’s velocity about the normal. Here’s a visualization of the intended behavior:</p>

<video title="A Desmos geometric animation of Swift Break ball bouncing logic." autoplay="" loop="" muted="">
  <source src="https://swift.org/assets/images/2024-03-12-byte-sized-swift-tiny-games-playdate/desmos-ball-bounce.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: Making the animation for this post ironically helped me root cause a bug in the bouncing logic. Under some combinations of entry angle and normal angle, the current design can cause the ball to bounce <em>down</em> into the paddle instead of up.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To turn the math into an algorithm, I had to perform the following steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Check if the object the ball collided with is the paddle</li>
  <li>Compute the location of the collision along the paddle from -1 to +1</li>
  <li>Map the location into a deflection angle from from -π/6 to +π/6</li>
  <li>Rotate the collision normal vector by the deflection angle</li>
  <li>Reflect the ball’s velocity along the rotated normal</li>
</ol>

<p>I then directly translated this algorithm into code inside the ball collision callback:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>if</span> <span>otherSprite</span><span>.</span><span>tag</span> <span>==</span> <span>.</span><span>paddle</span> <span>{</span>                                <span>// 1</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>placement</span> <span>=</span> <span>placement</span><span>(</span><span>of</span><span>:</span> <span>collision</span><span>,</span> <span>along</span><span>:</span> <span>otherSprite</span><span>)</span> <span>// 2</span>

  <span>normal</span><span>.</span><span>rotate</span><span>(</span><span>by</span><span>:</span> <span>deflectionAngle</span><span>)</span>                           <span>// 4</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>ballVelocity</span><span>.</span><span>reflect</span><span>(</span><span>along</span><span>:</span> <span>normal</span><span>)</span>                            <span>// 5</span>
</code></pre></div>

<h3 id="running-on-the-hardware-again">Running on the Hardware (Again!)</h3>

<p>Throughout the development of “Swift Break,” I regularly deployed the game to the Playdate Simulator. However, the real challenge emerged when I decided to run the game on actual Playdate hardware. As usual, I loaded the game, and … yet again, it crashed, but this time a lot of things were going wrong.</p>

<p>To cut a long debugging story short, I found that the <code>-Xfrontend</code> flag mentioned earlier did not entirely resolve the calling convention issues. To address this, I needed to configure the compiler to match the CPU and floating-point ABI of the microcontroller in the Playdate. This aspect was overlooked when I was porting Conway’s Game of Life since I happened to both not pass structs by value and didn’t use floating-point operations.</p>

<p>The final and most confusing crash arose from a specific Playdate C API call returning an enum from the Playdate OS. After a thorough debugging process, e.g. using <code>printf</code> everywhere, I uncovered a discrepancy in the memory layout of the enum between the system built with <code>gcc</code> and the game built with <code>swiftc</code>. With further research I found the difference stemmed from <code>gcc</code> defaulting to <code>-fshort-enums</code> while <code>swiftc</code> via <code>clang</code> used <code>-fno-short-enums</code> for the <code>armv7em-none-none-eabi</code> triple.</p>

<p>I collected these new and removed flags into the following compile command:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$ </span>swiftc <span>\</span>

<p>With these adjustments, I attempted once more, and <em>finally</em> “Swift Break” successfully ran on the Playdate hardware! I’ve included a brief video showcasing the game below:</p>

<h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping Up</h2>

<p>Thanks for diving into the bring-up journey with me. From refining the Swift Playdate API to tackling issues involving calling conventions, CPU configurations, and memory layout disparities, there was no shortage of challenges.</p>

<p>However, with the issues now resolved, creating Playdate games in Swift is a streamlined process. Just run <code>make</code> and enjoy a development experience with Swift that is both expressive <em>and</em> performant.</p>

<p>You can find all the code examples mentioned in this post in the <a href="https://github.com/apple/swift-playdate-examples">swift-playdate-examples</a> repository with accompanying “Getting Started” documentation.</p>

<p>I hope this post encourages you to explore the possibilities of using Swift in unconventional environments. Feel free to reach out with your experiences, questions, or game ideas on the <a href="https://forums.swift.org/t/byte-sized-swift-building-tiny-games-for-the-playdate/70615">Swift Forums</a>!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The NYPD sent a sweeping subpoena seeking information from the social media account of the president of a New York City police accountability organization in February, records reviewed by Hell Gate show, only to withdraw its subpoena when told they would need to justify the subpoena in court.</p><p>Michael Clancy, better known to friends on and off social media as <a href="https://twitter.com/minkoff_steven/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rabbi</a>, received a notice last month from X, formerly known as Twitter, alerting him to the fact that the NYPD had sent X a subpoena requesting "all records consisting but not limited to all subscriber name(s), Email address(s), Phone number(s), account creation date, IP logs with timestamps (IP address of account logins and logouts), all logs of previous messages sent and received." The subpoena also requested "all videos sent and received, including but not limited to meta-data. exit data about the messages and videos” for the account.</p><p>The notification included a copy of the subpoena, which warned X not to tell Clancy of its existence. "You are not to disclose or notify any customer or third party of the existence of this subpoena or that records were provided pursuant to this subpoena," the document read.</p><p>But X, following its own corporate policy, told Clancy anyway, and suggested he might want to get some legal representation to fight the subpoena, recommending the American Civil Liberties Union. Clancy did just that, and Kathryn Sachs of the New York Civil Liberties Union took up his case. Last Wednesday, Sachs wrote to the NYPD to challenge the administrative subpoena, which the NYPD had sent on its own authority, without any warrant or judicial approval. If the NYPD did not withdraw the subpoena, Sachs told the NYPD, Clancy would go to court with a motion to quash it. Rather than go to court to explain to a judge why the subpoena was necessary, the NYPD wrote back the same afternoon to say that it was withdrawing the subpoena altogether.</p><p>The NYPD subpoena letter cited as its empowering authority <a href="https://codelibrary.amlegal.com/codes/newyorkcity/latest/NYCadmin/0-0-0-25019" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Section 14-137 of the New York City Administrative Code</a>, which gives the NYPD commissioner the power to issue subpoenas. But as Sachs argued in her letter to the NYPD, that doesn't mean the police department can issue warrantless subpoenas for anything they feel like. Sachs cited case law suggesting that the subpoena power is actually restricted to investigations involving current or former officers.</p><p>Under the federal <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2703" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stored Communications Act</a>, authorities who want to subpoena electronic records from a provider either need a court-issued warrant, or, if they're using an administrative subpoena, "prior notice from the governmental entity to the subscriber or customer."</p><p>"This kind of administrative subpoena is not overseen by any court, and is not meant to target people like our client," Sachs told Hell Gate. "If it's left unchecked, it would chill speech from potentially anyone that the NYPD decided to subpoena information about."</p><p>"We don't give that kind of power to police departments without judicial review," said Marty Stolar, a lawyer who has worked on similar cases in the past. "It's got to be a process that's connected to a court if you're going to apply it to the general population. Here, the NYPD is misusing the power of subpoena to compel the production of documents as if they had the right to demand that information from any citizen. And they don't have that right. We have never given it to them."&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://lede-admin.hellgatenyc.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2024/03/Twitter_Subpoena.jpg?w=710" srcset="https://lede-admin.hellgatenyc.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2024/03/Twitter_Subpoena.jpg?w=425&amp;quality=75 425w, https://lede-admin.hellgatenyc.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2024/03/Twitter_Subpoena.jpg?w=850&amp;quality=75 850w, https://lede-admin.hellgatenyc.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2024/03/Twitter_Subpoena.jpg?w=585&amp;quality=75 585w, https://lede-admin.hellgatenyc.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2024/03/Twitter_Subpoena.jpg?w=1170&amp;quality=75 1170w, https://lede-admin.hellgatenyc.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2024/03/Twitter_Subpoena.jpg?w=710&amp;quality=75 710w, https://lede-admin.hellgatenyc.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2024/03/Twitter_Subpoena.jpg?w=1420&amp;quality=75 1420w" sizes="(max-width: 30rem) 425px, (min-width: 30rem) and (max-width: 40rem) 585px, (min-width: 40rem) 710px" loading="lazy"><figcaption>A copy of the NYPD subpoena supplied by X.</figcaption></figure><p>The legal status of the NYPD's use of warrantless subpoenas for social media information isn't as clear as it might be, in part because when the NYPD's use of such subpoenas is challenged, it tends to withdraw the subpoenas rather than engage in a court process that might definitively establish the legality or illegality of its practice.</p><p>In 2020, the department <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/14/nyregion/patriot-act-subpoena-nypd.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sent a nearly identical subpoena</a> to Twitter, seeking a broad swath of records for Tina Moore, a New York Post reporter covering the NYPD. When lawyers for the Post threatened to challenge the subpoena in court, the NYPD hastily withdrew it. The incident provoked significant backlash, with free speech advocates, the Post, and groups like the Media Law Resource Center decrying the chilling effect of the subpoena.</p><p>Clancy isn't working as a conventional journalist, but he is involved in the collection and dissemination of information about the NYPD. As president of the Brooklyn chapter of Copwatch Patrol Unit, Clancy receives tips about police conduct, and films police conduct himself. While the withdrawal of the subpoena makes it all but impossible to know what the NYPD's goal was in issuing it, he has his theories. Maybe the police are just trying to rattle him with a shot across the bow. Or maybe the NYPD is trying to find out whether NYPD officers themselves are feeding his organization information about misconduct. "That happens," Clancy told Hell Gate. "For a junior officer who sees misconduct by his superiors, if you take that to Internal Affairs, maybe your boss has a connection there and it winds up being you who gets in trouble. So some cops prefer to take it to Copwatch."</p><p>As a further wrinkle, the NYPD's subpoena letter to X was sent by Michael Yanni, a member of the office of the department's deputy commissioner for legal matters, but used the email address <a href="mailto:intelsubpoenas@nynjhidta.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">intelsubpoenas@nynjhidta.org</a>, a domain affiliated with the <a href="https://www.hidtaprogram.org/ny_nj.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">New York and New Jersey High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area</a> office, a regional and federal joint drug task force. Similarly, the letter from the NYPD notifying NYCLU of the withdrawal of the subpoena was sent from Mallory McGee, an attorney with the NYPD Legal Bureau, using another email attached to the drug task force.</p><p>Why are NYPD lawyers sending out subpoenas for a critic's private information without a warrant? Why are they using federal task force email domains to do it? Why did they withdraw the subpoena rather than defend its legitimacy in court? How many of these warrantless subpoenas have they sent out in the last year? We asked the NYPD these questions, but did not receive a response.</p><p>Clancy, for his part,<strong> </strong>said that he's undaunted, and that the NYPD has no business rummaging through his social media content and metadata.&nbsp;</p><p>"Why would you use a shower curtain and close the bathroom door when you take a shower, if you have nothing to hide?" he asked. "Because it's none of your business, that's why. What the police might want to know and what they have a legal right to know are two different things."</p></div></div>]]></description>

<h4 id="height-and-width"><span>
      Height &amp; Width
    </span></h4><p>then it generates a uv coords for each grass blade to sample a texture by doing</p><pre><code><span>vec2</span> bottom_left_corner <span>=</span> pc<span>.</span>aria_center<span>.</span>xz <span>-</span> <span>(</span>pc<span>.</span>aria<span>.</span>xy <span>/</span> <span>2.0</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

</code></pre>

<p>after that using the uv coords, we can sample a simplex noise texture to have height multiplier or width multiplier we can also add some terms for user control using simplex noise for height makes sense as the tall grass tends to stick together in real life.</p><p><img src="https://www.thegeeko.me/images/folliage-simplex.png" alt="simplex noise for hight"></p><h4 id="bend-term"><span>
      Bend Term
    </span></h4><p>This is a term to define how bendable a grass blade is which will be used later as a multiplier in vertex shader to do the animation.</p><h4 id="animation-term"><span>
      Animation term
    </span></h4><p>This is a term used by the animation formula to animate the grass it's the same for all of the vertices so calculating it here saves us time and allows us to not pass uvs to vertex shader which is 2 floats but for millions of blads it will be 100s of megabytes. It's calculated by the following</p><pre><code><span>float</span> <span>wind</span><span>(</span><span>vec2</span> uv<span>,</span> <span>float</span> time<span>,</span> <span>float</span> base_freq<span>,</span>

	<span>return</span> sin_term<span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>

<p>In the vertex shader this value will be used as a parameter for the sin function which will result in a kinda wind like wave, you can see for yourself here in <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/view/MXXXWj">shader toy</a></p><p>It's called <code>sin_term</code> because I'll pass it to sin function later in the vertex shader.</p><h4 id="pitch"><span>
      Pitch
    </span></h4><p>defines the angle of rotation around the UP axis, which is always <code>{0, 1, 0}</code> in our case the grass will always point upwards, so all we need is just an angle to construct a rotation matrix in the vertex shader. You can make this random or always face the camera or be controlled by the user whatever suits your needs.</p><h4 id="frustum-culling"><span>
      Frustum culling
    </span></h4><p>For the frustum culling, we start by generating a sphere around each blade the radius of the circle is determined by the max of height and width then we transform the sphere to camera space, at this point the distance from the camera is just the length of the point as in camera space the camera is at <code>0, 0, 0</code> we use this to apply the cutoff distance and choose LOD.</p><pre><code><span>float</span> radius <span>=</span> blade_height <span>&gt;=</span> blade_width <span>?</span> blade_height <span>:</span> blade_width<span>;</span>
<span>vec4</span> center <span>=</span> <span>vec4</span><span>(</span>pos<span>,</span> <span>1.0</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

</code></pre>

<p>then the frustum culling we kinda doing the projection by hand and then check if the sphere is in range, I only do culling on the x and y axes as for the z axis we already have a cutoff but adding that is also trivial. I learned this way of culling on <a href="https://youtu.be/NGGzk4Fi2iU?t=6962">Arseny Kapoulkine's stream</a> they explain it much better but basically, we extract the left or right plane(we need just one of them) and the top or bottom plane then on the GPU we calculate the dot product between the sphere center and planes while taking the abs of the x component of the center of the sphere to do the culling on both sides at same time utilizing its symmetry.</p><pre><code><span>// the dot product with x/z components of the x plain normal</span>

</code></pre>

<p>After that, we fill the blade info in the respective index in the blades data buffer</p><pre><code><span>uint</span> buf_index <span>=</span> pc<span>.</span>blades_number<span>.</span>x <span>*</span> i<span>.</span>y <span>+</span> i<span>.</span>x<span>;</span>

</code></pre>

<h4 id="draw-command-buffers"><span>
      Draw Command Buffers
    </span></h4><p>After generating the data we can fill the command buffer, each thread will atomically increase the number of instances in the <a href="https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VkDrawIndirectCommand.html">commands buffer</a> this allows us to know to use the instance count as an index in another buffer to store the indices of the visible blades which allows us to access the values using <code>gl_InstaceIndex</code> we can also copy the buffer and sort using prefix sum scan just like Acerola in his video but this is better memory-wise and probably performance wise but I didn't measure performance. in summary, the vertex shader will use <code>gl_InstaceIndex</code> to index into a buffer that contains the indices of the visible grass blades.</p><p><img src="https://www.thegeeko.me/images/foliage-buffers.png" alt="diagram showing the buffers layout"></p><p>The compute shader makes use of 2 indirect draw commands one for high LOD and other for low LOD we can add as many LOD levels as we want, and we check if it's low LOD or high and then increase <code>gl_InstanceIndex</code> in the respective command buffer.</p><pre><code><span>// cmd_buf[0] is high LOD</span>
<span>// cmd_buf[1] is low LOD</span>
<span>bool</span> low_lod <span>=</span> dist_from_cam <span>&gt;</span> low_lod_dist<span>;</span>
<span>if</span> <span>(</span>visible<span>)</span> <span>{</span>

		<span>1</span>
	<span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>

<p>after that, we use <code>index_in_visible</code> to index into the visible blades indices buffer and store the index of the current grass blade.</p><pre><code><span>// pc.visible is the buffer ref of the visible high LOD buffers</span>
<span>// pc.visible_low_lod is the buffer ref of the visible low LOD buffers</span>
DrawIndices indices <span>=</span> low_lod <span>?</span> pc<span>.</span>visible_low_lod <span>:</span> pc<span>.</span>visible<span>;</span>
indices<span>.</span>i<span>[</span>index_in_visible<span>]</span> <span>=</span> buf_index<span>;</span>
<span>// buf_index is the index of the grass blade.</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Now we have our indices data in a continuous buffer to index into using <code>gl_InstanceIndex</code> and <code>gl_DrawID</code> to determine which indices buffer to read from. We are ready to draw the grass blades.</p><h3 id="rendering"><span>
      Rendering
    </span></h3><p>In the vertex shader we start by pulling the Blade data respective to the current instance.</p><pre><code>DrawIndices visible <span>=</span> gl_DrawID <span>==</span> <span>1</span> <span>?</span> pc<span>.</span>visible_low_lod <span>:</span> pc<span>.</span>visible<span>;</span>

GrassBlade blade <span>=</span> pc<span>.</span>grass<span>.</span>data<span>[</span>i_visible<span>]</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre>

<p>After that, we construct a rotation matrix and apply the height and width multiplier.</p><pre><code><span>float</span> sin_pitch <span>=</span> <span>sin</span><span>(</span>blade<span>.</span>anim_size<span>.</span>z<span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>float</span> cos_pitch <span>=</span> <span>cos</span><span>(</span>blade<span>.</span>anim_size<span>.</span>z<span>)</span><span>;</span>

	<span>{</span>cos_pitch<span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>-</span>sin_pitch<span>}</span><span>,</span>
	<span>{</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>}</span><span>,</span>
	<span>{</span>sin_pitch<span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> cos_pitch<span>}</span><span>,</span>

<span>vec3</span> v_pos <span>=</span> rotation <span>*</span>

</code></pre>

<p>Then we use the sin term to animate the grass blade using a sin function we scroll with time and the height of the vertex because naturally the tip of of the grass blade skew more than the base.</p><pre><code><span>float</span> sin_term <span>=</span> blade<span>.</span>anim_size<span>.</span>w<span>;</span>
<span>float</span> bend <span>=</span> <span>sin</span><span>(</span>sin_term <span>+</span> pc<span>.</span>time <span>+</span> <span>(</span>blade<span>.</span>pos_bend<span>.</span>w <span>*</span> pos<span>.</span>y<span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
pos<span>.</span>z <span>+=</span> bend <span>*</span> pos<span>.</span>y<span>;</span>
</code></pre>

<p>here is how it looks</p><p>

  </iframe>
</p><p>For the color, I opted for a simple gradient that goes brighter as it gets higher. I plan to improve this for example using normals for the grass also add some specular lighting as it could look really nice for example like Ghost of Tsushima's grass.</p><h3 id="optimization"><span>
      Optimization
    </span></h3><p>The simplest thing I thought of was just to reduce the amount of the work the vertex shader does since it will run millions of times a low hanging fruit was multiplying the projection and view matrix on the CPU and have it ready for the vertex shader, the next thing we can do is optimize the grass blade mesh I've used <a href="https://github.com/zeux/meshoptimizer">Mesh Optimizer</a> by Arseny Kapoulkine I used it and did multiple optimizations and the one who had the most impact was converting the grass blade from a triangle list to a triangle strip that reduced the number of vertex shader invocations drastically and almost cut the vertex shader work in half and the shape of the grass blade can be represented nicely as a strip.</p><h4 id="very-rough-numbers"><span>
      very rough numbers
    </span></h4><p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>note I got the numbers using <a href="https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/html/vkspec.html#queries">Vulkan's timestamp queries</a></em></p><p>On my RX5600XT using the <a href="https://docs.mesa3d.org/drivers/radv.html">open source drivers(RADV)</a> on Linux in 1080p resleoution my GPU can process about 6'770'688 grass blade with all of them visible the compute shader takes about <code>4.7ms</code> and drawing it takes around <code>8ms</code> that's about it more than that it drop blew 60fps. Increasing the area covered by the grass to 1000 by 1000 we can consider up to 19'066'880 grass blade with compute shader taking about <code>2.5ms</code> and drawing them takes about <code>6ms</code>. <img src="https://www.thegeeko.me/images/folliage-stats.png" alt="performance data"></p></article></div>]]></description>

<li aria-level="1"><span>Marking a major investment in Meta’s AI future, we are announcing two 24k GPU clusters. We are sharing details on the hardware, network, storage, design, performance, and software that help us extract high throughput and reliability for various AI workloads. We use this cluster design for Llama 3 training.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>We are strongly committed to open compute and open source. We built these clusters on top of </span><a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2022/10/18/open-source/ocp-summit-2022-grand-teton/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Grand Teton</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.opencompute.org/wiki/Open_Rack/SpecsAndDesigns" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>OpenRack</span></a><span>, and </span><a href="https://pytorch.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>PyTorch</span></a><span> and continue to push open innovation across the industry.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>This announcement is one step in our ambitious infrastructure roadmap. By the end of 2024, we’re aiming to continue to grow our infrastructure build-out that will include 350,000 NVIDIA H100 GPUs as part of a portfolio that will feature compute power equivalent to nearly 600,000 H100s.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>To lead in developing AI means leading investments in hardware infrastructure. Hardware infrastructure plays an important role in AI’s future. Today, we’re sharing details on two versions of our </span><span>24,576-GPU data center scale cluster at Meta. These clusters support our current and next generation AI models, including Llama 3, the successor to</span><a href="https://ai.meta.com/llama/open-innovation-ai-research-community"> <span>Llama 2</span></a><span>, our publicly released LLM, as well as AI research and development across GenAI and other areas .</span></p>
<h2><span>A peek into Meta’s large-scale AI clusters</span></h2>
<p><span>Meta’s long-term vision is to build artificial general intelligence (AGI) that is open and built responsibly so that it can be widely available for everyone to benefit from. As we work towards AGI, we have also worked on scaling our clusters to power this ambition. The progress we make towards AGI creates new products,</span><a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2023/09/introducing-ai-powered-assistants-characters-and-creative-tools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <span>new AI features for our family of apps</span></a><span>, and new AI-centric computing devices.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>While we’ve had a long history of building AI infrastructure, we first shared details on our </span><a href="https://ai.meta.com/blog/ai-rsc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>AI Research SuperCluster (RSC)</span></a><span>, featuring 16,000 NVIDIA A100 GPUs, in 2022. RSC has accelerated our open and responsible AI research by helping us build our first generation of advanced AI models. It played and continues to play an important role in the development of </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13971" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Llama</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09288" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Llama 2</span></a><span>, as well as advanced AI models for applications ranging from computer vision, NLP, and speech recognition, to</span><a href="https://ai.meta.com/blog/emu-text-to-video-generation-image-editing-research/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <span>image generation</span></a><span>, and even</span> <a href="https://ai.meta.com/blog/code-llama-large-language-model-coding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>coding</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Meta-24K-GenAi-Clusters-hero.png?w=1024" alt="" width="1024" height="734" srcset="https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Meta-24K-GenAi-Clusters-hero.png 1999w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Meta-24K-GenAi-Clusters-hero.png?resize=916,656 916w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Meta-24K-GenAi-Clusters-hero.png?resize=768,550 768w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Meta-24K-GenAi-Clusters-hero.png?resize=1024,734 1024w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Meta-24K-GenAi-Clusters-hero.png?resize=1536,1100 1536w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Meta-24K-GenAi-Clusters-hero.png?resize=96,69 96w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Meta-24K-GenAi-Clusters-hero.png?resize=192,138 192w" sizes="(max-width: 992px) 100vw, 62vw"></p>
<h2><span>Under the hood</span></h2>
<p><span>Our newer AI clusters build upon the successes and lessons learned from RSC. We focused on building end-to-end AI systems with a major emphasis on researcher and developer experience and productivity. The efficiency of the high-performance network fabrics within these clusters, some of the key storage decisions, combined with the 24,576 NVIDIA Tensor Core H100 GPUs in each, allow both cluster versions to support models larger and more complex than that could be supported in the RSC and pave the way for advancements in GenAI product development and AI research.</span></p>
<h3><span>Network</span></h3>
<p><span>At Meta, we handle hundreds of trillions of AI model executions per day. Delivering these services at a large scale requires a highly advanced and flexible infrastructure. Custom designing much of our own hardware, software, and network fabrics allows us to optimize the end-to-end experience for our AI researchers while ensuring our data centers operate efficiently.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>With this in mind, we built one cluster with a remote direct memory access (RDMA) over converged Ethernet (RoCE) network fabric solution based on the </span><a href="https://www.arista.com/assets/data/pdf/Datasheets/7800R3-Data-Sheet.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Arista 7800</span></a><span> with </span><a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2021/11/09/data-center-engineering/ocp-summit-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Wedge400</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2021/11/09/data-center-engineering/ocp-summit-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Minipack2</span></a><span> OCP rack switches. The other cluster features an </span><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/networking/quantum2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>NVIDIA Quantum2 InfiniBand</span></a><span> fabric. Both of these solutions interconnect 400 Gbps endpoints. With these two, we are able to assess the suitability and scalability of these </span><a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2023/11/15/networking-traffic/watch-metas-engineers-on-building-network-infrastructure-for-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>different types of interconnect for large-scale training,</span></a><span> giving us more insights that will help inform how we design and build even larger, scaled-up clusters in the future. Through careful co-design of the network, software, and model architectures, we have successfully used both RoCE and InfiniBand clusters for large, GenAI workloads (including our ongoing training of Llama 3 on our RoCE cluster) without any network bottlenecks.</span></p>
<h3><span>Compute</span></h3>
<p><span>Both clusters are built using</span> <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2022/10/18/open-source/ocp-summit-2022-grand-teton/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Grand Teton</span></a><span>, our in-house-designed, open GPU hardware platform that we’ve contributed to the Open Compute Project (OCP). Grand Teton builds on the many generations of AI systems that integrate power, control, compute, and fabric interfaces into a single chassis for better overall performance, signal integrity, and thermal performance. It provides rapid scalability and flexibility in a simplified design, allowing it to be quickly deployed into data center fleets and easily maintained and scaled. Combined with other in-house innovations like our</span> <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2022/10/18/open-source/ocp-summit-2022-grand-teton/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Open Rack</span></a><span> power and rack architecture, Grand Teton allows us to build new clusters in a way that is purpose-built for current and future applications at Meta.</span></p>
<p><span>We have been openly designing our GPU hardware platforms beginning with our </span><a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2015/12/10/ml-applications/facebook-to-open-source-ai-hardware-design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Big Sur platform in 2015</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<h3><span>Storage</span></h3>
<p><span>Storage plays an important role in AI training, and yet is one of the least talked-about aspects. As the GenAI training jobs become more multimodal over time, consuming large amounts of image, video, and text data, the need for data storage grows rapidly. The need to fit all that data storage into a performant, yet power-efficient footprint doesn’t go away though, which makes the problem more interesting.</span></p>
<p><span>Our storage deployment addresses the data and checkpointing needs of the AI clusters via a home-grown Linux Filesystem in Userspace (FUSE) API backed by a version of Meta’s </span><a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/fast21/presentation/pan" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>‘Tectonic’ distributed storage solution</span></a><span> optimized for Flash media. This solution enables thousands of GPUs to save and load checkpoints in a synchronized fashion (a </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thundering_herd_problem#:~:text=In%20computer%20science%2C%20the%20thundering,able%20to%20handle%20the%20event."><span>challenge</span></a><span> for any storage solution) while also providing a flexible and high-throughput exabyte scale storage required for data loading.</span></p>
<p><span>We have also partnered with </span><a href="https://hammerspace.com/software/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Hammerspace</span></a><span> to co-develop and land a parallel network file system (NFS) deployment to meet the developer experience requirements for this AI cluster. Among other benefits, Hammerspace enables engineers to perform interactive debugging for jobs using thousands of GPUs as code changes are immediately accessible to all nodes within the environment. When paired together, the combination of our Tectonic distributed storage solution and Hammerspace enable fast iteration velocity without compromising on scale.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The storage deployments in our GenAI clusters, both Tectonic- and Hammerspace-backed, are based on the </span><a href="https://www.opencompute.org/documents/e1s-expansion-2ou-1s-server-design-specification-pdf"><span>YV3 Sierra Point server platform</span></a><span>, upgraded with the latest high capacity E1.S SSD we can procure in the market today. Aside from the higher SSD capacity, the servers per rack was customized to achieve the right balance of throughput capacity per server, rack count reduction, and associated power efficiency. Utilizing the OCP servers as Lego-like building blocks, our storage layer is able to flexibly scale to future requirements in this cluster as well as in future, bigger AI clusters, while being fault-tolerant to day-to-day Infrastructure maintenance operations.</span></p>
<h3><span>Performance</span></h3>
<p><span>One of the principles we have in building our large-scale AI clusters is to maximize performance and ease of use simultaneously without compromising one for the other. This is an important principle in creating the best-in-class AI models.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As we push the limits of AI systems, the best way we can test our ability to scale-up our designs is to simply build a system, optimize it, and actually test it (while simulators help, they only go so far). In this design journey, we compared the performance seen in our small clusters and with large clusters to see where our bottlenecks are. In the graph below, AllGather collective performance is shown (as normalized bandwidth on a 0-100 scale) when a large number of GPUs are communicating with each other at message sizes where roofline performance is expected.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Our out-of-box performance for large clusters was initially poor and inconsistent, compared to optimized small cluster performance. To address this we made several changes to how our internal job scheduler schedules jobs with network topology awareness – this resulted in latency benefits and minimized the amount of traffic going to upper layers of the network. We also optimized our network routing strategy in combination with NVIDIA Collective Communications Library (NCCL) changes to achieve optimal network utilization. This helped push our large clusters to achieve great and expected performance just as our small clusters.</span></p>

After we optimize the full system (software, network, etc.), we see large cluster performance return to the ideal 90%+ range.</figcaption></figure>
<p><span>In addition to software changes targeting our internal infrastructure, we worked closely with teams authoring training frameworks and models to adapt to our evolving infrastructure. For example, NVIDIA H100 GPUs open the possibility of leveraging new data types such as 8-bit floating point (FP8) for training. Fully utilizing larger clusters required investments in additional parallelization techniques and new storage solutions provided opportunities to highly optimize checkpointing across thousands of ranks to run in hundreds of milliseconds.</span></p>
<p><span>We also recognize debuggability as one of the major challenges in large-scale training. Identifying a problematic GPU that is stalling an entire training job becomes very difficult at a large scale. We’re building tools such as desync debug, or a distributed collective flight recorder, to expose the details of distributed training, and help identify issues in a much faster and easier way</span></p>
<p><span>Finally, we’re continuing to evolve PyTorch, the foundational AI framework powering our AI workloads, to make it ready for tens, or even hundreds, of thousands of GPU training. We have identified multiple bottlenecks for process group initialization, and reduced the startup time from sometimes hours down to minutes.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span>Commitment to open AI innovation</span></h2>
<p><span>Meta maintains its commitment to open innovation in AI software and hardware. We believe open-source hardware and software will always be a valuable tool to help the industry solve problems at large scale.</span></p>
<p><span>Today, we continue to support</span><a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2022/10/18/open-source/ocp-summit-2022-grand-teton/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <span>open hardware innovation</span></a><span> as a founding member of OCP, where we make designs like Grand Teton and Open Rack available to the OCP community. We also continue to be the largest and primary contributor to </span><a href="https://pytorch.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>PyTorch</span></a><span>, the AI software framework that is powering a large chunk of the industry.</span></p>
<p><span>We also continue to be committed to open innovation in the AI research community. We’ve launched the</span><a href="https://ai.meta.com/llama/open-innovation-ai-research-community" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <span>Open Innovation AI Research Community</span></a><span>, a partnership program for academic researchers to deepen our understanding of how to responsibly develop and share AI technologies – with a particular focus on LLMs.</span></p>
<p><span>An open approach to AI is not new for Meta. We’ve also launched the </span><a href="https://ai.meta.com/blog/ai-alliance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>AI Alliance</span></a><span>, a group of leading organizations across the AI industry focused on accelerating responsible innovation in AI within an open community. Our AI efforts are built on a philosophy of open science and cross-collaboration. An open ecosystem brings transparency, scrutiny, and trust to AI development and leads to innovations that everyone can benefit from that are built with safety and responsibility top of mind.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span>The future of Meta’s AI infrastructure</span></h2>
<p><span>These two AI training cluster designs are a part of our larger roadmap for the future of AI. By the end of 2024, we’re aiming to continue to grow our infrastructure build-out that will include 350,000 NVIDIA H100s as part of a portfolio that will feature compute power equivalent to nearly 600,000 H100s.</span></p>
<p><span>As we look to the future, we recognize that what worked yesterday or today may not be sufficient for tomorrow’s needs. That’s why we are constantly evaluating and improving every aspect of our infrastructure, from the physical and virtual layers to the software layer and beyond. Our goal is to create systems that are flexible and reliable to support the fast-evolving new models and research.&nbsp; </span></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div fs-toc-offsettop="5rem" fs-toc-element="contents" id="w-node-_1f6dfb0a-a2b6-7b6c-63db-a502d9c255db-48ffd991"><p>Deterministic simulation testing is fast becoming the gold standard for how mission critical software is tested. Deterministic simulation testing was first popularized by the <a href="https://www.foundationdb.org/">FoundationDB</a> team who spent 18 months building a deterministic simulation framework for their database before ever letting it write or read data from an actual physical disk. The results speak for themselves: FoundationDB is widely considered to be one of the most robust and well-tested distributed databases, so much so that Kyle Kingsbury (of Jepsen fame) refused to test it because their deterministic simulator already stress tested FoundationDB more than the Jepsen framework ever could.</p><p>The WarpStream team utilized FoundationDB heavily at Datadog when we built <a href="https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/engineering/introducing-husky/">Husky, Datadog’s columnar storage engine for event data</a>. Over the course of our careers, our team has operated (and been on-call for) almost every database on the market: M3DB, etcd, ZooKeeper, Cassandra, Elasticsearch, Redis, MongoDB, MySQL, Postgres, Apache Kafka and more. In our experience, FoundationDB stands in a league of its own in terms of correctness and reliability due to its early investment in deterministic simulation testing.</p><p>A more recent example of a database system that leverages this approach to testing is <a href="https://tigerbeetle.com/">TigerBeetle</a>, a financial transactions database, that uses <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC1B3d9C_sI">deterministic simulation testing</a> to build one of the most robust financial OLTP databases available today.</p><p>When we were designing WarpStream, we knew that it wouldn’t be enough to just replace Apache Kafka with something cheaper and easier to operate. Kafka is the beating heart of many companies most critical infrastructure, and if we were to stand any chance of convincing those organizations to adopt WarpStream, we’d have to compress 12+ years of production hardening into a much shorter time frame. We accelerated this process with our architectural decision to rely on object storage as the <em>only</em> storage in the system, bypassing many of the tricky problems of ensuring data durability, availability, and replication at scale. Still, the fact that WarpStream leverages object storage is only a small part of ensuring the correctness of the overall system.</p><h2>Antithesis</h2><p>When we first heard about Antithesis, we could hardly contain our excitement. Antithesis has created the holy grail for testing distributed systems: a bespoke hypervisor that deterministically simulates an entire set of Docker containers and injects faults, <em>created by the same people who made FoundationDB</em>. For a group of gray-haired distributed systems engineers, seeing Antithesis in action felt like a tribe of cavemen stumbling upon a post-industrial revolution society. As we spoke more to the Antithesis team, an idea began to crystallize: we could use Antithesis to deterministically simulate not only WarpStream, but our entire SaaS!</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/64baaecd9c5c9b1b6c38aa0e/65ef867803ca64e3d2e6587e_YVvFpLKTZhluuelHF7q2V7b9ABUwpO10pOj-_oj82XeYsh-liqTCnQ-1YCQQD3vAgzvuq5eY47zO76jW4YrCTehCmfw91o4UvoFtX2QlfEjJgTb_ZLzxcuB1rleAamm02bEho7kRdWKG0w86QxbWtG8.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>WarpStream was built differently than most traditional database products. It was designed from day one with a true data plane / control plane split. There are two primary components to WarpStream: First, the Agents (data plane) that act as “thick proxies” and expose the Kafka protocol to clients. The Agents also take care of all communication with object storage, layering in batching and caching to improve performance and keep costs low.</p><p>‍<br>Second is the WarpStream control plane which has two major components:</p><ol role="list"><li>The metadata store that tracks cluster metadata and performs remote consensus.</li><li>Our SaaS software that manages different tenants’ metadata stores, API keys, users, accounts, etc.</li></ol><p>The metadata store only has two dependencies:</p><ol role="list"><li>Any cloud KV store&nbsp;</li><li>Object storage</li></ol><p>The SaaS software adds one additional dependency: a traditional SQL database for managing users, organization, API keys, etc. Looking at WarpStream’s minimal dependencies, we thought, why not test its entire customer experience, from initial signup to running Kafka workloads?</p><p>We created a docker-compose file that contains the following components:</p><ol role="list"><li>Several WarpStream Agents</li><li>Several WarpStream Control Plane nodes</li><li>Several Apache Kafka clients</li><li>A KV store</li><li>Postgres</li><li>An object store (<a href="https://docs.localstack.cloud/user-guide/aws/s3/">localstack</a>)</li></ol><p>With the help of the Antithesis team, we wrote a test workload that started all of those services, signed up for a WarpStream account, created a virtual cluster, and then began producing and consuming data. The workload was carefully structured so that we could assert on a variety of different important properties that WarpStream must maintain at all times.</p><p>The test workload consists of multiple producers that are each assigned a unique ID and write records to a small set of topics. These producers synchronously write a few small JSON records that contain the producer’s ID, a counter (a monotonic sequence number for that producer), and a few other properties. We repeat the same components as the record’s key, value, and in a header to ensure we never shuffle those around accidentally. The consumer side of the workload polls all the topics and all the partitions and asserts that:</p><ol role="list"><li>The topic and partition the record was consumed from matches the topic and partition the record was produced to.</li><li>The offsets for each record in each partition are monotonic.</li><li>The sequence numbers for each producer are monotonic, i.e. if we group the records by &lt;Topic, Partition, ProducerID&gt; the sequence number encoded in the record is monotonically increasing.</li></ol><p>The consumers store all of the records for each polling iteration and can assert that a record at offset X in the previous poll still exists in a future poll. This ensures that WarpStream doesn't lose or reorder data as e.g. background compaction runs to reorganize the cluster’s data for more efficient access.</p><p>These assertions address many of the classes of bugs found in previous Jepsen tests of Apache Kafka and other Kafka-compatible systems. For example, prior Jepsen tests have caught bugs like:</p><ol role="list"><li>Loss of previously acknowledged writes. If a write was acknowledged but failed to appear in the output for that topic-partition in the future, assertion 1 or 3 above would fire.</li><li>Violation of producer idempotency (i.e producing duplicate records without the producer itself crashing or restarting).&nbsp; Antithesis automatically tests our Idempotent Producer implementation by disrupting the network between the producer client and the agent or the agent and the control plane, leading to internal retries inside the Kafka client. A duplicate would cause the sequence number from a producer to stay the same or decrease, causing assertion 3 above to fire.</li><li>Records appearing in different topic-partitions than they were originally written to. This is addressed by assertions 1 or 3 above.</li></ol><h2>What’s the big deal?</h2><p>At this point you might be scratching your head a little bit and wondering: “What’s the big deal here? Isn’t this just a really fancy integration test!?”. Yes and no. Before we started using Antithesis, WarpStream already had a pretty robust set of stress tests we called the “correctness tests”.</p><p>These tests do essentially everything we just described, but in a regular CI environment. Our correctness tests even inject faults all over the WarpStream stack using a custom chaos injection library that we wrote. These tests are incredibly powerful, and they caught a <em>lot</em> of bugs. We would go as far as saying that investing deeply in those correctness tests is one of the main reasons that we were able to develop WarpStream as efficiently as we did.</p><p>Just like our existing correctness tests, the Antithesis hypervisor automatically injects faults, latency, thread hangs, and restarts into the workload. However, unlike our correctness tests, the Antithesis hypervisor is <em>really smart</em> and automatically fuzzes the system under test in an intelligent way.</p><p>Antithesis automatically instruments your software to measure code coverage and build statistics about the execution frequency of each code path. This enables Antithesis to detect “interesting” behavior in the test (such as infrequent code paths getting exercised, or rare log messages being emitted).</p><p>When Antithesis detects interesting or rare behavior, it immediately snapshots the state of the entire system before exploring various different execution branches. This means that Antithesis is <em>much</em> better at triggering rare or unlikely behavior in WarpStream than our existing correctness tests were.</p><p>Also, since Antithesis runs the entire software stack in a deterministic simulator, they can actually run the simulation at <em>faster than wall clock time</em>. Similar to FoundationDB, WarpStream makes heavy use of timers and batching to improve performance. Anytime a WarpStream Goroutine does the equivalent of time.Sleep(), the Antithesis hypervisor <em>doesn’t actually have to wait</em>. On top of that, the Antithesis hypervisor explores code branches <em>concurrently</em>. All of this adds up in a meaningful way such that Antithesis can cost effectively compress years of stress testing into a much shorter time frame.</p><p>It’s hard to over-emphasize just how transformative this technology is for building distributed systems. For all intents and purposes, it really does feel like a time-traveler arrived from 20 years in the future and gave us their state of the art software testing technology. Of course, it’s not <em>actually</em> magic. Antithesis is the result of dozens of the smartest software engineers, statisticians, and machine learning experts pouring their heart and souls into the problem of software testing for 5 years straight. But to us mere mortals, it does feel a lot like magic.</p><h2>We found some bugs</h2><p>Let’s look at a few example runs that Antithesis generated for us.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/64baaecd9c5c9b1b6c38aa0e/65f066a2ce79a8d23436120b_antithesis%20report%20final.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Antithesis ran the WarpStream workload for 6 wall clock hours, during which it simulated 280 hours of application time. The graph shows that it took about 160 “application hours” for Antithesis to “stall” and stop discovering new “behaviors” in the WarpStream workload. This means that running the tests for longer than 160 hours has diminishing returns, and instead we should invest in making the test itself more sophisticated if we want to exercise the codebase more. Great feedback for us!</p><p>But think about that for a moment: even after 140 hours of injecting faults, randomizing thread execution, automatically detecting that something interesting / rare had happened and intentionally branching to investigate further, Antithesis was still “discovering” new behaviors in WarpStream. We could hire a 100 distributed systems engineers and make them write integration tests for an entire year, and they probably wouldn’t be able to trigger all the interesting states and behavior that a single Antithesis run covered in 6 hours of wall clock time.</p><p>As just one example of how powerful this is, on the first day we started using Antithesis it caught a data race in our metrics instrumentation library that had been present since the first month of the project.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/64baaecd9c5c9b1b6c38aa0e/65f0668f355b0f7639cbe921_antithesis%20data%20race%20final.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Our correctness tests had run in our regular CI workflows for literally <em>10s of thousands of hours</em> by then, with the Go race detector enabled, and not once ever caught this bug. Antithesis caught this bug in its first 233 seconds of execution.</p><p>A data race in the instrumentation library isn’t that exciting, though. What about an extremely rare data loss bug that is the result of both a network failure and a race condition? That’s more exciting!</p><p>To minimize the number of S3 PUTs that WarpStream users have to pay for, the Agents buffer Kafka Produce requests from many different clients in-memory for ~250ms before combining the batches of data into a single file and flushing it to object storage.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/64baaecd9c5c9b1b6c38aa0e/65ef86782ecf7975e9265e8b_eWyuN7USMfacq1cJSUWU9OuqagABl_7ImESBFKyhTiGiotejnSXeO40xn2oydgktnAU8HJpYK8RowxiR2iy3lZ4aTyiGSV6pJNNJTkHvuc6C9D4v75TnjrZj5JHygYuahZDF9BBnBUvuaz8tZyIZfvg.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>In some scenarios, like if write throughput is high, there will be multiple outstanding files being flushed to object storage concurrently. Once flushing the files succeeds, committing the metadata for the flushed files to the control plane can be batched to reduce networking overhead. This is implemented using a background Goroutine that periodically scans the list of “flushed but not yet committed” files.</p><p>While refactoring the Agent to add speculative retries for flushing files to object storage, we subtly broke the error handling on this path so that, for a very brief window of time, a file which failed to flush would be considered successful and ready to commit to the control plane metadata store. In program order (i.e. the linear flow of the code, ignoring concurrency) this window where the background Goroutine that commits metadata would see the successful file would be nearly impossible to squeeze into. This background Goroutine only polls for successful files every five milliseconds, and the time between the two state transitions in the common case would be less than a microsecond!</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/64baaecd9c5c9b1b6c38aa0e/65ef8757b0bcd3c9f824e5a8_Frame%2042%20(7).png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>This bug is the manifestation of two unlikely events: a file failing to flush and a specific thread interleaving that should be extremely rare in practice. Despite how unlikely these events are to occur together, on a long enough time-scale, this bug would have resulted in data loss at some point.</p><p>Instead, thanks to Antithesis’ powerful fuzzer and fault injector, this rare combination of events happened roughly once per wall clock hour of testing. We’d been running a build with this bug in our staging environment and obviously did not encounter that bug at all, let alone once per hour, as it would’ve immediately been noticed when a future background compaction failed due to the missing file in object storage. We’ve since fixed the regression in the code such that the invalid, temporary state transition cannot occur.</p><h2>Why not Jepsen?</h2><p>The obvious question you might be asking yourself at this point is: Why use Antithesis instead of a traditional Jepsen test? It’s a good question, and one we asked ourselves before embarking on our journey with Antithesis.</p><p>We’re big fans of Jepsen and have consumed almost every published report. However, after speaking with the Antithesis team and spending a few months integrating with it, we feel strongly that deterministic simulation testing with tools like Antithesis is a much more robust and sustainable path forward for the industry. Specifically, we think that the Antithesis’ approach is better than Jepsen’s for a few reasons:</p><ol role="list"><li>The Antithesis technology is more robust, and much more likely to catch bugs than the Jepsen harness. There is simply no other equivalent (that we’re aware of) to Antithesis’ custom hypervisor, and its ability to automatically instrument distributed systems for code coverage and effectively “hunt” for bugs. Yes, the Jepsen framework will inject faults into a running environment in an effort to trigger bugs and edge-case behavior, but this approach is crude in comparison to what Antithesis does.</li><li>Antithesis integrates natively into how our engineers are used to working. The entire test setup is expressed using standard docker-compose files and Docker images, and Antithesis tests are kicked off using Github Actions that push WarpStream images to Antithesis’ docker registry. When we add new functionality, all our engineers have to do is modify the Antithesis workload and kick off an automated CI job. The entire experience and workflow lives right next to our existing codebase, CI, and workflows. Extra bonus: none of our engineers had to learn Clojure.</li><li>Antithesis testing is designed to be a continuous process with accompanying professional services that help you grow and adapt the tests as the scope of your product increases. That means our users get the confidence that every WarpStream release is actively tested with Antithesis, unlike a traditional Jepsen test where the engagement is short-lived and usually only covers a “snapshot” of a system at a static point in time.</li><li>Finally, it would not have been practical to continuously test our entire SaaS platform with Jepsen in the same way that we do with Antithesis. While that may seem like overkill, we think it’s a pretty important point. For example, consider the fact that almost every cloud infrastructure provider has a routing or proxy layer that is responsible for routing customer requests to the correct set of infrastructure that hosts the customer’s resources. A small data race or caching bug in that routing layer could result in exposing one customer’s resources to a different customer. These multi-tenant SaaS layers are never tested in traditional Jepsen testing, but with Antithesis it was actually easier to include these layers in our testing than to specifically exclude them.</li></ol><p>We’re just getting started with Antithesis! Over the coming months we plan to work with the Antithesis team to expand our testing footprint to cover additional functionality like:</p><ol role="list"><li>Multi-region deployments of our SaaS platform.</li><li><a href="https://docs.warpstream.com/warpstream/configuration/deploy/splitting-agent-roles">Multi-role Agent Clusters</a>.</li><li>Injecting and detecting data corruption at the storage and file cache layer using checksums.</li><li>And much more!</li></ol><p>If you’d like to learn more about WarpStream, please <a href="https://www.warpstream.com/contact-us">contact us</a>, or <a href="https://console.warpstream.com/socials/slack">join our Slack!</a></p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><header><h2>A four-day forecast today is as accurate as a one-day forecast 30 years ago.</h2></header><p>Weather forecasts are often seen as just a nice thing to have. Useful when planning a Sunday barbecue, or when we want to know if we’ll need an umbrella for the day. But in many ways weather forecasts are absolutely crucial: they can be a matter of life and death.</p><p>Accurate forecasts can save lives by giving early warnings of storms, heat waves, and disasters. Farmers use them for agricultural management, which can make the difference between a lost harvest or a harvest of plenty. Grid operators rely on accurate forecasts of temperatures for heating and cooling demand, and how much energy they’ll get from wind and solar farms. Pilots and sailors need them to carry people across oceans safely. Accurate information about future weather is often absolutely vital.</p><p>In this article, I look at improvements over time and the global inequalities that need to be closed to protect lives and livelihoods around the world.</p><h2 id="weather-forecasts-have-improved-a-lot">Weather forecasts have improved a lot<a href="#weather-forecasts-have-improved-a-lot"></a></h2><p>Weather forecasting has come a long way. In 650 B.C. the Babylonians would try to predict weather patterns based on cloud patterns and movements. Three centuries later, Aristotle wrote <em>Meteorologica</em>, discussing how phenomena such as rain, hail, hurricanes, and lightning formed. Much of it turned out to be wrong, but it represents one of the first attempts to explain how the weather works in detail.</p><p>It wasn’t until 1859 that the UK’s Meteorological Service (the Met Office) <a href="https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/about-us/who/our-history" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">issued its first</a> weather forecast for shipping. Two years later, it broadcasted its first public weather forecast. While meteorological measurements improved over time, the massive step-change in predictions came with the use of computerized numerical modeling. This didn’t start until a century later, in the 1960s.</p><p>Forecasts have improved a lot since then. We can see this across a range of measurements, and different national meteorological organizations.</p><p>The Met Office <a href="https://blog.metoffice.gov.uk/2023/11/15/why-an-exact-date-weather-forecast-headline-isnt-what-it-seems/#:~:text=Despite%20the%20certainty%20suggested%20in,come%20with%20in%2Dbuilt%20uncertainty." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">says</a> its four-day forecasts are now as accurate as its one-day forecasts were 30 years ago.</p><p>Predictions have gotten much better in the United States, too. We can see this in some of the most important forecasts: the prediction of hurricanes.</p><p>The National Hurricane Center <a href="https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/verification/verify5.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">publishes data</a> on the “track error” of hurricanes and cyclones — the error in <em>where</em> the hurricane hits. This is shown in the chart below, from the 1960s onwards.</p><p>Each line represents the error of forecasts for different time periods in advance. For example, 12 hours before it hits, all the way up to 120 hours (or 5 days) before.</p><p>We can see that this track error — especially for longer-term forecasts — has decreased a lot over time. In the 1970s, a 48-hour forecast had an error between 200 and 400 nautical miles; today this is around 50 nautical miles.</p><p>We can show the same data another way. In the chart below, each line represents the average error for each decade. On the horizontal axis we have the forecast period, again extending from 0 to 120 hours.</p><p>The 72-hour error in the 1960s and 70s was over 400 nautical miles. Today, it’s less than 80 miles.</p><p>Meteorologists can now make pretty accurate predictions of where a hurricane will hit three or four days in advance, which lets cities and communities prepare while preventing unnecessary evacuations that might have been implemented in the past.</p><figure><picture><source srcset="https://ourworldindata.org/images/published/hurricane-forecasting-error_100.png 100w, https://ourworldindata.org/images/published/hurricane-forecasting-error_350.png 350w, https://ourworldindata.org/images/published/hurricane-forecasting-error_850.png 850w, https://ourworldindata.org/images/published/hurricane-forecasting-error_1350.png 1350w, https://ourworldindata.org/images/published/hurricane-forecasting-error_7963.png 7963w" type="image/png" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 95vw, (min-width: 960px) 853px"><img src="https://ourworldindata.org/images/published/hurricane-forecasting-error.png" alt="Line chart showing the reduction in hurricane forecasting errors from the 1960s to the 2020s.

While national weather agencies use much higher-resolution processing to get local forecasts, these global models provide a crucial input into these systems.</p><p>The ECMWF publishes analyses of its errors over time. This is shown in the chart below.<a href="#note-1"><sup>1</sup></a> It shows the difference between the forecast and the actual weather outcome for forecasts 3, 5, 7, and 10 days in advance. The metric used here is the “<a href="https://climate.copernicus.eu/esotc/2022/atmospheric-circulation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">500 hPa geopotential height</a>”, a commonly used meteorological measure of air pressure (which dictates weather patterns).</p><p>The solid line is for the Northern Hemisphere, and the dashed line is for the Southern.</p><p>Three-day forecasts —&nbsp;shown in blue — have been pretty accurate since the 1980s, and have still gotten a lot better over time. Today the accuracy is around 97%.</p><p>The biggest improvements we’ve seen are for longer timeframes. By the early 2000s, 5-day forecasts were “highly accurate” and 7-day forecasts are reaching that threshold today. 10-day forecasts aren’t quite there yet but are getting better.</p><figure><picture><source srcset="https://ourworldindata.org/images/published/improved-weather-forecasting_100.png 100w, https://ourworldindata.org/images/published/improved-weather-forecasting_350.png 350w, https://ourworldindata.org/images/published/improved-weather-forecasting_850.png 850w, https://ourworldindata.org/images/published/improved-weather-forecasting_1350.png 1350w, https://ourworldindata.org/images/published/improved-weather-forecasting_7463.png 7463w" type="image/png" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 95vw, (min-width: 960px) 853px"><img src="https://ourworldindata.org/images/published/improved-weather-forecasting.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="7463" height="NaN"></picture></figure><h2 id="why-have-weather-forecasts-improved">Why have weather forecasts improved?<a href="#why-have-weather-forecasts-improved"></a></h2><p>A few key developments <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aav7274" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">explain these improvements</a>.<a href="#note-2"><sup>2</sup></a></p><p>The first big change is that the data has improved. More extensive and higher-resolution observations can be used as inputs into the weather models. This is because we have more and better satellite data, and because land-based stations are covering many more areas around the globe, and at a higher density. The precision of these instruments has improved, too.</p><p>These observations are then fed into numerical prediction models to forecast the weather. That brings us to the next two developments. The computers on which these models are run have gotten much faster. Faster speeds are crucial: the Met Office now chunks the world into grids of smaller and smaller squares. While they once modeled the world in 90-kilometer-wide squares, they are now down to a grid of 1.5-kilometer squares. That means many more calculations need to be run to get this high-resolution map. The methods to turn the observations into model outputs have also improved. We’ve gone from very simple visions of the world to methods that can capture the complexity of these systems in detail.</p><p>The final crucial factor is how these forecasts are communicated. Not long ago, you could only get daily updates in the daily newspaper. With the rise of radio and TV, you could get a few notices per day. Now, we can get minute-by-minute updates online or on our smartphones.</p><h2 id="low-income-countries-have-much-worse-forecasts-and-often-no-early-warning-systems">Low-income countries have much worse forecasts, and often no early warning systems<a href="#low-income-countries-have-much-worse-forecasts-and-often-no-early-warning-systems"></a></h2><p>At home in Scotland, I can open an app on my phone and get a pretty accurate 5-day forecast within seconds. Unfortunately, this quality of information isn’t available to everyone. There are large differences in weather forecasts across the world, with a large gap between rich and poor.</p><p>As the researchers Manuel Linsenmeier and Jeffrey Shrader report in a <a href="https://ideas.repec.org/p/osf/socarx/7e2jf.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recent paper</a>, a 7-day forecast in a rich country can be more accurate than a one-day forecast in some low-income ones.<a href="#note-3"><sup>3</sup></a></p><p>While national forecasts have improved over time across all income levels, the quality gap today is almost as wide as it was in the 1980s.</p><p>There are a few reasons for this. First, far fewer land-based instruments and radiosondes measure meteorological data in poorer countries. Second, the frequency of reporting is much lower.</p><p>This is unsurprising when we look at the amount of money spent on weather and climate information. In <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.1602632" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a paper</a> published in <em>Science</em>, Lucian Georgeson, Mark Maslin, and Martyn Poessinouw looked at differences in spending across income groups.<a href="#note-4"><sup>4</sup></a> This includes private and public spending on commercial products that fall within the definition of “weather and climate information services”.</p><p>This is shown as the spending <em>per person</em>, and the spending as a share of gross domestic product (GDP) in the chart below.</p><p>Low-income countries spend 15 to 20 times less per person than high-income countries. But given the size of their economies, they actually spend <em>more</em> as a share of GDP.</p><p>This gap is a problem. 60% of workers in low-income countries are <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/share-of-the-labor-force-employed-in-agriculture?tab=chart&amp;country=Low+income~High+income">employed in agriculture</a>, arguably the most weather-dependent sector. Most <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/africa-yields-problem" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">are small-scale farmers</a>, who are often extremely poor.</p><p>Having accurate weather forecasts can help farmers make better decisions. They can get information on the best time to plant their crops. They know in advance when irrigation will be most needed, or when fertilizers might be at risk of being washed away. They can receive alerts about pest and disease outbreaks so they can either protect their crops when an attack is coming or save pesticides when the risk is low. That means they can use precious resources most efficiently if they have access to accurate weather forecasts. Good weather forecasts are most crucial for the poorest people in the world.</p><p>They’re also crucial for protecting against cyclones, heat waves, flooding, and storm surges. Having accurate forecasts several days in advance allows cities and communities to prepare. Housing can be protected, and emergency services can be on standby to help with the recovery.</p><p>But accurate forecasts alone don’t solve the problem: they’re only useful if they are disseminated to people so they can respond. Many of the deadliest disasters over the last few decades <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212096322000687" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">were accurately forecasted</a> ahead of time. The common failure was poor communication.<a href="#note-5"><sup>5</sup></a></p><p>Improving forecasts is the foundation. But these also need to be incorporated into effective early warning systems. The World Meteorological Organization <a href="https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/099050123155016375/pdf/P1765160197f400b80947e0af8c48049151.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">estimates that</a> around one-third of the world — predominantly the poorest countries — do not have them.</p><h2 id="improving-forecasts-especially-in-low-income-countries-is-underrated">Improving forecasts — especially in low-income countries — is underrated<a href="#improving-forecasts-especially-in-low-income-countries-is-underrated"></a></h2><p>After the big progress in recent decades, we take good weather forecasting and dissemination for granted in large parts of the world. Making this available to everyone would make a difference.</p><p>This will be even more important as climate change increases the risks of weather-related disasters. It is ultimately the poorest, who are the more vulnerable, who will suffer the worst consequences. Better forecasts are key to good climate change adaptation.</p><p>Proper investment and financial support will be essential to close the gaps.</p><p>There also emerging technologies that could accelerate this. A <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06185-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recent paper</a> published in <em>Nature </em>documented a new <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/artificial-intelligence" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">artificial intelligence (AI)</a> system — Pangu-Weather — that can perform forecasts as accurately (or better) than leading meteorological agencies up to 10,000 times faster.<a href="#note-6"><sup>6</sup></a> It was trained on 39 years of historical data. The speed of these forecasts would make them much cheaper to run and could provide much better results for countries with limited budgets.</p><p>Faster and more efficient technologies can also fill the gaps where land-based weather stations aren’t available. Sensor-carrying drones can run surveys over specific areas to build higher-resolution maps. With lower-cost and more efficient ways of turning that into forecasts, mobile technologies can disseminate this information quickly. Some companies are already sending messages to farmers in low-income countries to advise them on the best time to plant their crops.</p><p>This innovation is crucial to making countries more resilient to weather today. But it’s also essential in a world where weather is likely to get more extreme.</p><div><h4>Acknowledgements</h4><p>Many thanks to Max Roser and Edouard Mathieu for their valuable feedback and comments on this article.</p></div><div><h3 id="article-endnotes">Endnotes</h3><ol><li id="note-1"><p>These charts are sourced from the following sources: Alley, R.

																			<div><p>We’re providing more flexibility for developers who distribute apps in the European Union (EU), including introducing a new way to distribute apps directly from a developer’s website.</p><h3>More flexibility</h3><p>Developers who’ve agreed to the Alternative Terms Addendum for Apps in the EU have new options for their apps in the EU:</p><ul>
<li>Alternative app marketplaces. Marketplaces can choose to offer a catalog of apps solely from the developer of the marketplace.</li>
<li>Linking out to purchase. When directing users to complete a transaction for digital goods or services on an external webpage, developers can choose how to design promotions, discounts, and other deals. The Apple-provided design templates, which are optimized for key purchase and promotional use cases, are now optional. </li>
</ul><h3>Distributing directly from your website</h3><p>Web Distribution, available with a software update later this spring, will let authorized developers distribute their iOS apps to EU users directly from a website owned by the developer. Apple will provide authorized developers access to APIs that facilitate the distribution of their apps from the web, integrate with system functionality, back up and restore users’ apps, and more. For details, visit <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/web-distribution-eu/">Getting ready for Web Distribution in&nbsp;the&nbsp;EU</a>. </p></div>

As of today, Apple is allowing third-party app stores to offer apps solely from their own catalog. For example, a games studio could create an app store on iOS that exclusively offers their own games.</p>
<p>When directing users to complete a transaction on their website, developers can also now choose how to design their in-app promotions, discounts, and deals. Apple's templates for designing these links out to websites are optional as of today.</p>
<p>In addition, developers will soon be able to distribute apps directly from their websites, providing they meet Apple's specific criteria, such as being a member of the Apple Developer Program for two continuous years or more and having an app with more than one million first installs on iOS in the EU in the prior year, and commit to ongoing requirements, such as publishing transparent data collection policies. Apps distributed in this way must meet Apple's notarization requirements like all other iOS apps and can only be installed from a web domain registered in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> Connect.</p>
<p>Authorized developers will gain access to APIs to facilitate app distribution from the web, integration with system functionality, back up and restore, and more. Web distribution will become available following a software update later in the spring – allowing app downloads directly from a website for the first time on iOS. </p>
<p>The latest changes are part of Apple's Digital Markets Act (DMA) compliance plan and only apply within the European Union.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
          🏆 I provide private lessons on Emacs, Linux, and Life in
          general: <a href="https://protesilaos.com/coach/">https://protesilaos.com/coach/</a>.
          Lessons continue <strong>throughout the year</strong>.
        </p><article>

	

	<div>
		<p>On 2022-04-07 I moved all my Emacs projects from GitLab to SourceHut:
<a href="https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2022-04-07-all-emacs-projects-sourcehut/">https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2022-04-07-all-emacs-projects-sourcehut/</a>.
I am now undoing that decision. My code is on GitLab and GitHub, with
the latter as the de facto primary source.</p>

<p>Why the change:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The SourceHut web interface does not show any kind of indication
that a message has an attachment. Last time I tried it, I had to
download an mbox file and extract the patch from there. This was
helped by the fact that I knew what I was searching for, but the
experience was not pleasant anyway.</li>
  <li>Many users are reluctant to subscribe to my project’s mailing list
and instead email me directly. This is fine, as I do get the work
done eventually, but it beats the point of having a public inbox if
I am the only one who reads those messages anyway.</li>
  <li>Personal emails for package maintenance make it more difficult for
me to apply filters. I cannot easily go from “personal” to
“packages” and thus have trouble prioritising tasks.</li>
  <li>Users replying to mailing list threads frequently do not “reply to
all”, so the filter I have for SourceHut lists does not apply and my
inbox is noisy again.</li>
  <li>Coordinating work between my “official” SourceHut-based repository
and the de facto GitHub one is a problem, because a user on one may
not be aware of what a user on the other is doing.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are other papercuts as well, but I understand SourceHut is still
in “alpha”, so I will not list them here.</p>

<h2>What happens to the Git repositories on SourceHut?</h2>

<p>I am no longer updating them and plan to delete them in the near
future.</p>

<h2>What about the mailing lists?</h2>

<p>I will continue to reply to messages sent there, but I will eventually
ask people to use other media. If you do not want to use a Git forge
to report an issue or send a patch, then do it via my personal email:
<a href="https://protesilaos.com/contact">https://protesilaos.com/contact</a>.</p>

<h2>Will you host your own Git server?</h2>

<p>I want to do this at some point because I am mindful of the issues
with proprietary Git forges. But this is a task that requires
knowledge and resources. So it will not happen soon.</p>
