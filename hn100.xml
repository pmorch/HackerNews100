        <section>
          <p>We’re interested in getting integrated into the flow VSCode uses to do remote editing over SSH, because everybody is using VSCode now, and, in particular, they’re using forks of VSCode that generate code with LLMs. </p>
<p>”hallucination” is what we call it when LLMs get code wrong; “engineering” is what we call it when people do.</p>
<p>LLM-generated code is <a href="https://nicholas.carlini.com/writing/2024/how-i-use-ai.html" title="">useful in the general case</a> if you know what you’re doing. But it’s ultra-useful if you can close the loop between the LLM and the execution environment (with an “Agent” setup). There’s lots to say about this, but for the moment: it’s a semi-effective antidote to hallucination: the LLM generates the code, the agent scaffolding runs the code, the code generates errors, the agent feeds it back to the LLM, the process iterates. </p>

<p>So, obviously, the issue here is you don’t want this iterative development process happening on your development laptop, because LLMs have boundary issues, and they’ll iterate on your system configuration just as happily on the Git project you happen to be working in. A thing you’d really like to be able to do: run a closed-loop agent-y (“agentic”? is that what we say now) configuration for an LLM, on a clean-slate Linux instance that spins up instantly and that can’t screw you over in any way. You get where we’re going with this.</p>

<p>Anyways! I would like to register a concern.</p>

<p>Emacs hosts the spiritual forebearer of remote editing systems, a blob of hyper-useful Elisp called <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/tramp/" title="">“Tramp”</a>. If you can hook Tramp up to any kind of interactive environment — usually, an SSH session — where it can run Bourne shell commands, it can extend Emacs to that environment.</p>

<p>So, VSCode has a feature like Tramp. Which, neat, right? You’d think, take Tramp, maybe simplify it a bit, switch out Elisp for Typescript.</p>

<p>You’d think wrong!</p>

<p>Unlike Tramp, which lives off the land on the remote connection, VSCode mounts a full-scale invasion: it runs a Bash snippet stager that downloads an agent, including a binary installation of Node. </p>

<p>I <em>think</em> this is <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/tree/c9e7e1b72f80b12ffc00e06153afcfedba9ec31f/src/vs/server/node" title="">the source code</a>?</p>

<p>The agent runs over port-forwarded SSH. It establishes a WebSockets connection back to your running VSCode front-end. The underlying protocol on that connection can:</p>

<ul>
<li>Wander around the filesystem
</li><li>Edit arbitrary files
</li><li>Launch its own shell PTY processes
</li><li>Persist itself
</li></ul>

<p>In security-world, there’s a name for tools that work this way. I won’t say it out loud, because that’s not fair to VSCode, but let’s just say the name is murid in nature.</p>

<p>I would be a little nervous about letting people VSCode-remote-edit stuff on dev servers, and apoplectic if that happened during an incident on something in production. </p>

<p>It turns out we don’t have to care about any of this to get a custom connection to a Fly Machine working in VSCode, so none of this matters in any kind of deep way, but: we’ve decided to just be a blog again, so: we had to learn this, and now you do too.</p>

<p dir="auto"><code>ExpenseOwl</code> is an extremely simple expense tracking system with a modern monthly pie-chart visualization. It tracks daily expenses, visualizes monthly spending patterns, and maintains an overview of financial habits.</p>

<p dir="auto">There are a ton of amazing projects for expense tracking across GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/actualbudget/actual">Actual</a>, <a href="https://github.com/firefly-iii/firefly-iii">Firefly III</a>, etc.). They're all incredible, but they aren't the <em>fastest</em> when trying to add expenses, and offer a ton of features which I don't use. Some use varying formats of data or complex APIs. <em>Don't get me wrong</em>, they're great when needed, but I wanted something dead simple that just gives me a pie chart per month and a tabular representation. NOTHING else!</p>
<p dir="auto">Hence, I created this project, which I use in my homelab to track my expenses. The data is just JSON, so I can do whatever I want with that, including using <code>jq</code> to convert to CSV. The UI is elegant and mobile-friendly.</p>
<p dir="auto">The intention of this app is to track spending across your categories in a simplistic manner. No complicated searching, no editing - just add, delete, and view! This intention is not going to change throughout the lifecycle of this project. This is not an app for budgeting, it's for tracking.</p>

<ul dir="auto">
<li>Simple expense tracking with essential details only (optional name, date without time, amount, and category)</li>
<li>UUID-based expense identification in the backend</li>
<li>Flat file storage system (<code>data/expenses.json</code>)</li>
<li>Multi-architecture Docker container with support for persistent storage</li>
<li>REST API for expense management</li>
<li>Single-user focused (mainly for a homelab deployment)</li>
<li>CLI for both server and client (if needed) operations</li>
<li>Custom categories via environment variable (<code>EXPENSE_CATEGORIES</code>) with sensible defaults</li>
<li>Custom currency symbol in the frontend via environment variable (<code>CURRENCY</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Visualization</h3><a id="user-content-visualization" aria-label="Permalink: Visualization" href="#visualization"></a></p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Dashboard with expense category breakdown (pie chart)
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Click on a category to exclude it from the graph, click again to add it back</li>
<li>This helps visualize the breakdown without considering some categories like Rent</li>
<li>The legend shows a total expenditure of the month along with a total without the "Rent" category</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Table view for detailed expense listing
<ul dir="auto">
<li>This is where you can view individual expenses chronologically and delete them</li>
<li>You can use the browser's search to find a name if needed</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Month-by-month navigation</li>
</ol>

<p dir="auto">The frontend of ExpenseOwl can be installed as a Progressive Web App on desktop and mobile devices. To install:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Desktop: Click the install icon in your browser's address bar</li>
<li>iOS: Use Safari's "Add to Home Screen" option in the share menu</li>
<li>Android: Use Chrome's "Install" option in the menu</li>
</ul>

<p dir="auto">Reiterating that you should use this to just add expenses quickly. The default name for an expense is <code>unnamed</code> and the date is automatically set to current date. There's a default list of categories to choose from, which can be edited very easily.</p>
<p dir="auto">In the ideal case, <code>enter the amount and choose category</code> - that's it!</p>
<p dir="auto">For a bit more involved case, <code>enter the amount and name, choose the category, and select the date</code> - still very simple!</p>
<p dir="auto">The application only allows addition and deletion, there's no need for editing. There are no tags, no wallet info, no budgeting, nothing! Plain and simple for the win.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody text">
    <p>Shipping large software to end-user devices is a complicated process. Shipping large software <em>securely</em> to end-user devices is even more complicated. Signing the things that ship to end-user devices is one of those complications, and it gets even more complicated when you sign thousands of artifacts per day.</p>

<p>Mozilla has been signing Firefox in some form beginning with Firefox 1.0. This began with detached GPG signatures for builds, and progressed to Authenticode signing for Windows installers in Firefox 1.0.1. Since then it has evolved over time to encompass other platforms, other types of files within our products, and other ways that we ship (such as our own update packages). This post will provide a overview of the what, when, why, and how of code signing at Mozilla over the past ~20 years.</p>

<h2>What, when, and why</h2>

<h3>Early GPG &amp; Authenticode Signing</h3>

<p>When we first began signing, it happened on a Windows machine. Late in the release process, after Windows installers had been built, we would download all of the release artifacts to this machine, sign the Windows installers, and generate detached GPG signatures for those before pushing the artifacts elsewhere.</p>

<p>At this time, the private keys and certificates were held on a USB stick that was kept removed from the machine at-rest. A Release Engineer needed to be physically present in Mountain View to perform this step. Once inserted, signing could be done via Remote Desktop rather than at the physical machine (but don't forget to remove the USB stick afterwards!).</p>

<p>GPG signing was done with the standard GPG tools, running in cygwin. Authenticode signing was also done with the standard (at the time) Microsoft 'signcode.exe' tool. An annoying fact about that tool, is that it only accepted the necessary passphrase from a GUI dialog. To work around this, we had an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AutoIt">AutoIt</a> script running in the background that injected the passphrase into this dialog whenever it popped up. This interesting way of automating the process meant that mouse movements or keyboard interaction at the wrong time could interfere with the signing process.</p>

<p>This process was partly scripted, but there was still a series of ~15 commands someone had to run by hand (and not mess up) to get everything done. You can see these commands for yourself in our now-ancient <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/ReleaseEngineering/Unified_Release_Process#Sign_builds">Unified Release Process</a> documentation.</p>

<h3>Windows internal file signing</h3>

<p>Careful readers may have noted that early Authenticode signing only covered the Firefox installer itself, not the EXEs and DLLs inside of it. At some point (I haven't gone to the effort of tracking down exactly where...) we started signing these inner files as well. This process seems to have been <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/ReleaseEngineering/Unified_Release_Process#Signing_windows_files">lost to the sands of time</a>, but I seem to recall it worked very similarly to the installer signing process, but without the GPG parts.</p>

<h3>Improved signing on Windows</h3>

<p>The first notable improvement we had to this process was to automate most of the copy/pasting that was done from the wiki. This came in the form of <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/build-tools/blob/dba69406faad0c8e7a016150a3f5761ef83914d2/release/signing/Makefile">a Makefile that with a few mere inputs</a>, would download, sign, and re-upload the signed builds. The main benefit of this was reduced opportunity for human error.</p>

<p>Not long after that, <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=470146">we had our first real game-changing improvements</a>. Chris AtLee <a href="https://atlee.ca/posts/blog20090804faster-signing/">wrote a nice post about it back in 2009</a>, and how his changes took signing time from 8 hours all the way down to sub-15 minutes. This was accomplished through a combination of faster hardware, parallelized signing, in-process compression &amp; decompression, and better caching. His changes also introduced <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/build-tools/blob/c2e8e6f048db8990d629f169072d2a06b42e4759/release/signing/sign-release.py">a hefty amount of python</a> into the signing process, which paved the way for the next big improvement...</p>

<h3>Automatic signing</h3>

<p>Despite the signing process now being very quick once it gets started, it could still sometimes take hours or longer to begin the process. Typically this would happen if our build and repack processes finished at a time when no Release Engineer was around to begin signing. This was solved with what we called "autosign". Rather than require a Release Engineer to be around at the right moment, we adjusted our scripts to allow them to <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=558464#c1">be started ahead of time</a>, and be smart enough to know when all of the files it needs to sign are ready. This work eliminated all wait time between builds being ready and signing running.</p>

<h3>Signing Windows builds...on Linux!</h3>

<p>In 2011, <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=509158#c10">signing was rearchitected altogether</a>. In short, the idea was to move signing to a highly secured Linux server, and sign builds through an API as part of the build process. This allowed builds to be signed as they were produced, and reduced the number of times builds had to move from one server to another before they shipped.

An obvious question here is how we would manage to sign Windows binaries on Linux...as it turns out, the mono project had <a href="https://manpages.debian.org/testing/mono-devel/signcode.1.en.html">its own version of signcode that ran natively on Linux</a> that we were able to make use of.</p>

<h3>MAR Signing</h3>

<p>Shortly after (and perhaps even motivating - I'm not sure at this point) the aforementioned signing server work, we <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=699700">began signing our MAR (Mozilla ARchive) packages</a> that update users from an older version of Firefox to a newer version. Thanks to the earlier work, it was fairly trivial to use the same architecture to sign these files.</p>

<h3>macOS .app signing</h3>

<p>The idea of signing .app bundles for macOS was filed <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=400296#c0">all the way back in 2007</a>. There was <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=400296#c25">some initial work on this</a> in 2010, but we were unable to land it at that time. Around the same time that MAR signing was happening in 2012, we <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=400296#c68">picked up this work again</a> and managed to drive it home this time.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there were no tools available at the time to sign macOS builds on anything except a fairly modern macOS machine. For this reason, we had to run additional copies of our signing server on macOS and sign those builds with them. (If you've ever had to run macOS as a server you'll know just how unfortunate this was...)</p>

<h3>Taskcluster/signingscript/iscript</h3>

<p>In 2018, Mozilla migrated its CI and Release automation from our aging Buildbot systems to <a href="https://taskcluster.net/">Taskcluster</a>. As part of this, signing tasks moved to specialized Taskcluster workers known as "signingscript" and "iscript", used for signing non-macOS and macOS builds respectively. These specialized workers continued to outsource the actual work of signing to the previously discussed signing servers.</p>

<p>An important part of this change is the introduction of <a href="https://scriptworker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/chain_of_trust.html">Chain of Trust</a>, a significant security enhancement that helps ensure that only authentic artifacts are signed to this day.</p>

<h3>Introducing...Autograph!</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/mozilla-services/autograph">Autograph</a> is Mozilla's modern code signing service. It was built specifically to provide a signing service that allowed us to keep private key material in Hardware Security Modules (HSMs). Migrating release signing to it was a huge improvement over the existing signing server where Release Engineers had direct access to such things. It was initially used for signing XPIs and APKs, but by the end of 2019 we had migrated all non-macOS signing to it and retired the old Linux signing servers.</p>

<p>In addition to the security enhancements it brought, we saw great performance wins with it as well, largely in thanks to it's support for <a href="https://github.com/mozilla-services/autograph/blob/main/docs/architecture.md#overview"> only requiring a hash of the bytes being signed to be sent over the wire</a>. (This requires that the client has some advanced knowledge of the file being signed, but it saves a <em>tremendous</em> amount of network traffic at our scale.)

</p>
<h3>Notarization with rcodesign</h3><p>

In 2023 we started making use of <a href="https://gregoryszorc.com/docs/apple-codesign/0.17.0/apple_codesign_rcodesign.html">rcodesign</a> to <a href="https://github.com/mozilla-releng/scriptworker-scripts/pull/714">notarize and staple our macOS builds</a>. While actual macOS code signing itself continues to happen on macOS machines, this allowed us to move at least some of our operations into the cloud and reduce our reliance on mac hardware.

</p><h2>Tools and tech</h2>

<p>I've mentioned a number of tools and technology that we use as part of signing, but I've purposely glossed over some details in the interest of brevity. The following section is a glossary of sorts, and introduces some more under the hood tools that we use as part of signing. If you're interested in the gory details, the links below should be enough to find them for yourself! Or you can stop by <a href="https://chat.mozilla.org/#/room/#firefox-ci:mozilla.org">#firefox-ci on Matrix to ask questions!</a></p>

<h3>osslsigncode</h3>
<p>osslsigncode is a <a href="https://github.com/mtrojnar/osslsigncode">tool that implements parts of Microsoft's signtool.exe</a>. In the past, we used it to directly sign PE files. These days, we use it's support for attaching the signatures that Autograph makes to them.</p>

<h3>winsign</h3>
<p>Winsign is a <a href="https://github.com/mozilla-releng/winsign">python library for signing and manipulating Authenticode signatures</a>. It relies on osslsigncode for writing signatures, and supports signing directly with a private key, or outsourcing the signing process to a passed in function. The latter is what we use, and it's how we inject a call to Autograph into the signing process.</p>

<h3>msix-packaging</h3>
<p>In 2021 we began shipping Firefox as an MSIX package. As part of this we discovered that osslsigncode does not support signing MSIX packages. Luckily for us, Microsoft's MSIX packaging tools are open source and run on Linux, and we found a <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/msix-packaging/issues/340#issuecomment-620797067">fork that contained most of what was needed</a> to support signing. With a few additional modifications, we were able to support signing these packages in our existing systems.</p>

<h3>apple-codesign</h3>
<p><a href="https://gregoryszorc.com/docs/apple-codesign/0.17.0/index.html">apple-codesign</a> is a very exciting project from Gregory Szorc which provides 3rd party tools capable of signing, notarizing, and stapling .app bundles and other Apple formats such as .pkg and .dmg. These tools run on Linux, and as noted above, we're already making use of them to notarize and staple our .app bundles.

We're extremely excited about this project, and grateful to Gregory Szorc for all the effort he's bit into it. In the future we're looking forward to migrating our actual code signing to these tools which would (finally) allow us to retire our dedicated macOS signing machines.</p>

<h3>mardor</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/mozilla-releng/build-mar">mardor</a> is a python tool to manage, and most importantly, sign, MAR files. In the days before Autograph it was used to directly sign MAR files. These days we only use it to inject signatures made by Autograph into the files, similar to our usage of osslsigncode.</p>

<h3>signingscript</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/mozilla-releng/scriptworker-scripts/tree/master/signingscript">signingscript</a> is the glue between our CI system (Taskcluster) and Autograph. Through a combination of the tools listed above, custom code in signingscript itself, and communication with Autograph it produces signed builds. It is additionally responsible for notarizing and stapling our macOS builds.</p>

<h3>iscript</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/mozilla-releng/scriptworker-scripts/tree/master/iscript">iscript</a> is essentially a pared down version of signingscript (in fact their code is both derived from our early signing server code), and is responsible for signing our macOS builds. iscript runs on a small cluster of mac minis, which are a huge pain in the butt to manage.

</p>
<h3>autograph</h3><p>
As noted in an earlier section <a href="https://github.com/mozilla-services/autograph">Autograph</a> is our modern code signing service. It has a simple HTTP API that accepts signing requests and returns signed data or files. In addition to signing various artifacts that we ship it also makes <a href="https://github.com/mozilla-services/autograph/blob/main/signer/contentsignaturepki/README.md">Content Signatures</a> on behalf of addons.mozilla.org, aus5.mozilla.org/Balrog (our update server), and some other backend services that Firefox communicates with, helping to ensure the security and integrity of requests made between Firefox and Mozilla-run services.

</p><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>What a ride it's been over the last 20 years! We've gone from signing nothing to signing nearly everything in some form. Signing started off as a very manual process, and now happens seamlessly thousands of times per day.</p>

<p>I don't think it would be possible to name everyone that contributed to this, but it took the ideas and efforts of tens, if not hundreds, of people to get to this point: release engineers, build system experts, security folks, and many others were all critical to getting us where we are today.</p>

But with more and more mail being sent,&nbsp;in 1963 the Postal Service decided to roll out the <strong>Zone Improvement Plan</strong> &nbsp;which transformed addresses to look like the following:</p><p><strong>Mr. John Smith<br>3256 Epiphenomenal Avenue<br>Minneapolis &nbsp;MN 55416</strong></p><p>The five digit code represents a part of the country (5_ _ _ _ ) &nbsp;a sectional center facility ( _ 5 4 _ _ ) &nbsp;and the associate post office or delivery area (_ _ _ 1 6). </p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63483ad423421bd16e7a7ae7/66b9cffc5d14b6e5ca213d33_639c39c9c67f664c8539d8da_zip-first-digit.png" alt="First digit of every zip code" loading="lazy"></p></figure><p>The first digit for every zip code for the states in the contiguous United States</p><p>By 1967 ZIP codes were made mandatory for bulk mailers and continued to be adopted by almost anyone sending mail in the US. Over time,&nbsp;the ZIP+4 was added to add more granularity to the zip code to denote specific locations &nbsp;even buildings for postal workers to deliver. The Postal Service even created a character,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._ZIP">Mr. Zip</a>,&nbsp;to promote the use of ZIP codes,&nbsp;who was featured on stamps,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf71PHyOfR0">commercials</a> &nbsp;and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojn6U2kP_pQ">songs</a>.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63483ad423421bd16e7a7ae7/639c39c9c67f66731639d8de_mr-zip.jpeg" alt="Mr. Zip" loading="lazy"></p></figure><p>ZIP codes themselves do not actually represent an area,&nbsp;rather a collection of routes:</p><p>Despite the geographic derivation of most ZIP Codes,&nbsp;the codes themselves do not represent geographic regions; in general,&nbsp;they correspond to address groups or delivery routes. As a consequence &nbsp;ZIP Code "areas" can overlap &nbsp;be subsets of each other,&nbsp;or be artificial constructs with no geographic area (such as 095 for mail to the Navy &nbsp;which is not geographically fixed). In similar fashion,&nbsp;in areas without regular postal routes (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_delivery_service">rural route</a> areas) or no mail delivery (undeveloped areas) &nbsp;ZIP Codes are not assigned or are based on sparse delivery routes &nbsp;and hence the boundary between ZIP Code areas is undefined.</p><p>The US Census provides data for <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/guidance/geo-areas/zctas.html">ZIP Code Tabulation Areas</a>,&nbsp;or geographic files:</p><p>ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs) are generalized areal representations of United States Postal Service (USPS) ZIP Code service areas.The USPS ZIP Codes identify the individual post office or metropolitan area delivery station associated with mailing addresses. USPS ZIP Codes are not areal features but a collection of mail delivery routes.</p><p>Here we find our first problem with ZIP Codes,&nbsp;that they do not represent an actual area on a map,&nbsp;but rather a collection of routes that help postal workers effectively deliver mail. They aren't designed to measure sociodemographic trends &nbsp;as a business would generally want to do. You can actually look up <a href="https://www.melissa.com/v2/lookups/mapcartzip/zipcode?zipcode=10009">individual delivery routes</a> &nbsp;like the one below:</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63483ad423421bd16e7a7ae7/639c39c9c67f66975339d8e4_zip-route-nyc.png" alt="One zip code route in New York's East Village" loading="lazy"></p></figure><p>One zip code route in New York's East Village</p><p>We are only scratching the surface of the issue here. Similar issues exist around the world,&nbsp;with postal codes representing strange boundaries</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63483ad423421bd16e7a7ae7/639c39c9c67f66abda39d8dc_global-zip-shapes.png" alt="Postal Codes in London  Toronto  and Sydney" loading="lazy"></p></figure><p>Postal Codes in London,&nbsp;Toronto,&nbsp;and Sydney.</p><h3>Using ZIP codes for data analysis</h3><p>Fast forward to today,&nbsp;where many companies can easily look into their database and find a dataset with a zip_code column in it, which allows them to group and aggregate data to see trends and business performance metrics. As stated earlier,&nbsp;the problem with ZIP Codes is that:</p><ol role="list"><li>They don't represent real boundaries &nbsp;but rather routes</li><li>They don't represent how humans behave</li></ol><p>The later represents two specific issues in using spatial data: spatial scale of observations and spatial scale support (you can learn more about this in this lecture from UChicago's Luc Anselin, <a href="https://youtu.be/MmCYeJ27DsA?t=326">here</a>). The first is that humans don't behave based on <a href="https://carto.com/spatial-data-catalog/boundary-data">administrative units</a> such as zip codes,&nbsp;or even census units. Their behavior is influenced much more by their neighbors,&nbsp;or areas such as a neighborhoods or high activity areas (such as central business districts). The second is that spatial data is provided at multiple scales,&nbsp;and many times those boundaries are overlapping or nested within another boundary. </p><p>Let's look at an example of this in one specific area in Dallas.</p><p>In this map,&nbsp;we can see large white boundaries,&nbsp;which represent <a href="https://carto.com/spatial-data-catalog/browser/dataset/acs_sociodemogr_716c8567/">ZIP code boundaries</a>,&nbsp;and below them are boundaries for <a href="https://carto.com/spatial-data-catalog/browser/geography/tigr_blockgroup_688551c7/">US Census Block Groups</a>. The darker green represents higher income,&nbsp;as provided by the US Census. You can access both of these datasets - with associated sociodemographic data - via our <a href="https://carto.com/spatial-data-catalog/browser">Spatial Data Catalog</a>.</p><p>When we look at one specific ZIP Code we can see that income data in even more detail:</p><p>What we can see is that 12 month median household income in this single zip code (75206) ranges from $9,700 to $227,000 when we look at block groups that completely or partially fall within this single ZIP Code,&nbsp;which the Census lists as having a median household income of $63,392.</p><p>Median Income is one way to evaluate the range of values within a ZIP Code (keep in mind these are ZCTA boundaries) but we can likely see variance like this in population,&nbsp;employment,&nbsp;and other relevant metrics for data analysis. </p><p>Sticking with median household income,&nbsp;we decided to expand this analysis to the entire United States,&nbsp;to see which areas are the least and most in-equal when you look at ZIP Codes and the Census Block Groups that intersect with the ZCTA Boundaries.</p><p><strong>The most unequal zip code is 33139 in Miami Beach &nbsp;FL</strong></p><ol role="list"><li>33139: Miami &nbsp;FL ($241,344 Difference)</li><li>44120: Cleveland &nbsp;OH ($237,501 Difference)</li><li>10013: New York &nbsp;NY ($233,559 Difference)</li><li>10023: New York &nbsp;NY ($233,157 Difference)</li><li>11201: Brooklyn &nbsp;NY ($233,031 Difference)</li><li>10601: White Plains &nbsp;NY ($232,813 Difference)</li><li>33141: Miami &nbsp;FL ($232,633 Difference)</li><li>92648: Huntington Beach &nbsp;CA ($231,290 Difference)</li><li>98105: Seattle &nbsp;WA ($230,906 Difference)</li><li>33143: Miami &nbsp;FL ($230,626 Difference)</li></ol><p><strong>The most similar* zip code is in Chesapeake &nbsp;WV</strong></p><ol role="list"><li>25315: Chesapeake &nbsp;WV ($2 Difference)</li><li>79357: Cone &nbsp;TX ($4 Difference)</li><li>65052: Linn Creek &nbsp;MO ($9 Difference)</li><li>73093: Washington &nbsp;OK ($12 Difference)</li><li>68370: Hebron &nbsp;NE ($13 Difference)</li><li>19541: Mohrsville &nbsp;PA ($15 Difference)</li><li>05340: Bondville &nbsp;VT ($18 Difference)</li><li>12958: Mooers &nbsp;NY ($26 Difference)</li><li>19941: Ellendale &nbsp;DE ($37 Difference)</li><li>54896: Loretta &nbsp;WI ($38 Difference)</li></ol><p><em>* similar where the difference is greater than 0</em></p><p>We can quickly use <a href="https://carto.com/workflows">CARTO Workflows</a> to perform this analysis for all of the United States without code.

Next, the <a href="https://docs.carto.com/carto-user-manual/workflows/components/joins#spatial-join">Group By</a> component was used to calculate the minimum and maximum income for each zip code, after which the Create Column component was used to calculate the difference between the two. </p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63483ad423421bd16e7a7ae7/66b9cffc5d14b6e5ca213d37_65609c448a3c55d4b787852c_zip_codes_workflow.png" loading="lazy" alt="A screenshot of CARTO Workflows being used to analyze zip codes "></p></figure><p>After creating this as a new table we can see that the majority of the most unequal zip codes tend to be in cities or larger metro areas and more equal zip codes tend to be in rural areas around the country.</p><p><a href="https://clausa.app.carto.com/map/29fd0873-64cb-42a6-a90d-c83a8840bbfe">Check out the full map.</a></p><p> <a href="https://carto.com/signup/" target="_blank">Sign me up for a FREE account</a></p><p>Learn more about how organisations are changing the way they perform spatial analysis with our FREE ebook <a href="https://go.carto.com/state-spatial-data-science-2024">The State of Spatial Data Science 2024</a>!</p><figure><a href="https://go.carto.com/state-spatial-data-science-2024" target="_blank"><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63483ad423421bd16e7a7ae7/66b9cffc5d14b6e5ca213d1b_66b9cfe8dd3bc64e0fcb225b_State%2520of%2520Spatial%2520Data%2520Science%2520202%2520-%2520Email%2520620x280.png" loading="lazy" alt="A promotional imagefor the report"></p></a></figure><h3>So why do we use ZIP Codes?</h3><p>In practice,&nbsp;it is easy to use zip codes as a geospatial unit. As we stated earlier,&nbsp;almost any e-commerce or delivery service,&nbsp;or app that uses location or needs to locate their users in any way will collect a zip code. Additionally &nbsp;everyone is familiar with zip codes &nbsp;as they are part of any address in most countries. </p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63483ad423421bd16e7a7ae7/639c39c9c67f669fdb39d8db_zip-lookup.png" alt="'Find A Store' on Target.com" loading="lazy"></p></figure><p>'Find A Store' on Target.com</p><p>Terms like Census Block Group or Tract are less familiar to those who don't work with geospatial data on a regular basis &nbsp;and they can be more difficult to find and harder to work with &nbsp;especially if you aren't familiar with terms like Shapefile, FTP,&nbsp;and ETL. Even then you have to go through the US Census FTP website,, download geographic files state by state &nbsp;and join those files to census measures.</p><p>Finally,&nbsp;most people know &nbsp;without looking at a map that zip codes represent a smaller area than a city,&nbsp;but larger than say a neighborhood. Conceptually,&nbsp;they feel small enough to get a very focused view of the world,&nbsp;and big enough to capture enough of a sample size of trends.</p><p><strong>The short answer is that zip codes are easy to find,&nbsp;familiar,&nbsp;and provide a granular enough view of the world (or so we thought).</strong></p><p>With that said there are real world problems that arise from using zip codes in geospatial analysis. One example is in real estate where,&nbsp;in many cities or areas,&nbsp;there are homes listed in a &nbsp;zip code &nbsp;even though as we know those boundaries are arbitrary. <a href="https://hbr.org/2019/04/research-when-airbnb-listings-in-a-city-increase-so-do-rent-prices">This article</a> from the Harvard Business Review also describes a similar phenomenon with Airbnb listings and rising rent prices.</p><p>In simple terms &nbsp;we argue that if a zip code is "touristy," meaning it has a lot of restaurants and bars,&nbsp;and if awareness of Airbnb increases &nbsp;which we measure using the Google search index for the keyword "Airbnb," then any jump in Airbnb supply in that zip code is likely driven by an increase in demand for short-term rentals through Airbnb &nbsp;rather than local economic conditions.</p><p>More importantly,&nbsp;using zip codes for analysis can mask serious conditions that are taking place at a different spatial scale. The Flint water crisis was one of these cases. This article by Richard Casey Sadler,&nbsp;an Assistant Professor at Michigan State University describes the problem in great detail and raises similar points about zip codes (the full article is well worth reading):</p><p>Dr. Tony Grubesic,&nbsp;an Arizona State University professor &nbsp;has called them "one of the <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0038012106000516">quirkier 'geographies'</a> in the world." Dr. Nancy Krieger,&nbsp;a Harvard University professor &nbsp;and colleagues have called out their <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1447194/">unacceptability</a> for small-area analyses.</p><p>Ultimately the state used zip codes to analyze the blood lead statistics in aggregate,&nbsp;which effectively masked the actual issue. This is because:</p><p>In Flint's case,&nbsp;the state's error was introduced because "Flint ZIP codes" do not align well with the city of Flint or its water system. The city and water system are almost 100 percent coterminous – that is &nbsp;they share the same boundaries… &nbsp;In total,&nbsp;Flint ZIP codes used in the state's analysis blanket parts of eight different municipalities (seven townships and one city) surrounding Flint.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63483ad423421bd16e7a7ae7/639c39c9c67f66616a39d8e1_flint-zip-misallignment.jpeg" alt="'Map by Richard Casey Sadler" loading="lazy"></p></figure><p>Map by Richard Casey Sadler</p><p>In the case of Flint &nbsp;simply looking at a different spatial scale or analysis may have shown the problem more clearly. For fields like public health and critical services &nbsp;understanding and using appropriate spatial scale is critically important.</p><h3>What else can we do?</h3><p>So if you are compelled to do away with zip code analysis,&nbsp;the good news is that there are several different options available.</p><h4>Use Addresses</h4><p>The first and foremost recommendation would be to use real world addresses. When you know an address string,&nbsp;you can use a geocoder - or the service that Google or other map search engines use to take an address and transform it into latitude and longitude. Most every major service offers an API and wrappers for different languages to do this. Keep in mind there are generally some <a href="https://docs.mapbox.com/help/troubleshooting/address-geocoding-format-guide/">best practices</a> for cleaning your data &nbsp;and you will need valid address strings to do so. Other tools like <a href="https://github.com/openvenues/libpostal">Libpostal</a> can help you normalize and parse your address strings.</p><h4>Use Census Units</h4><p>You can also use Census units such as a Census Block Group or Tract. As I mentioned it has not always been easy to find and collect this data at scale &nbsp;but there are many new tools that are becoming available to use. <a href="https://github.com/cenpy-devs/cenpy">CenPy</a> is a Python library that allows you to connect and find Census data (good <a href="https://medium.com/@mswhitetoyou/scraping-us-census-data-via-cenpy-9aeab12c877e">tutorial here</a>) where you can find measures from the decennial census or American Community Survey. CARTO also provides Census and ACS through the <a href="https://carto.com/developers/data-observatory/">Data Observatory</a> &nbsp;which was used in the notebook for the full US analysis.</p><p>You can also find out Census geometry IDs for a specific address location using the <a href="https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/Geocoding-services.html">US Census Geocoder</a>. You can pass in a variety of parameters via the API or use it in Python with the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/censusgeocode/">censusgeocode</a> package.</p><p>As your gather address data,&nbsp;you can easily add in a Census Tract or Block Group ID to that entry &nbsp;and use that rather than the zip code field in your data. This will allow you to do the same aggregation you were doing &nbsp;except at a more appropriate geographic scale.</p><h4>Use your own Spatial Index</h4><p>Finally -&nbsp;and arguably the best option - is to use a Spatial Index.</p><p>Spatial Indexes like <a href="https://eng.uber.com/h3/">H3</a> and <a href="http://s2geometry.io/%3ES2%20cells%3C/a%3E%20%20you%20can%20use%20%3Ca%20href=">quadkey</a> are global, multi-resolution grid systems which are geolocated by a short reference ID, rather than a complex geometry. This makes them super lightweight to store and lightning-fast to analyze. The grid cells have the same shape (although their size varies by latitude), meaning data is evenly geographically distributed - avoiding boundary and visual bias which is often caused by irregular grids like zip code; read&nbsp;more <a href="https://carto.com/blog/hexagons-for-location-intelligence">here</a>. </p><p>‍</p><p>A key benefit here is the anonymization of sensitive data. Given that address data can be sensitive &nbsp;you can create a data pipeline that simply reads incoming addresses &nbsp;geocodes them,&nbsp;assigns a spatial index,&nbsp;then passes that indexed data into a separate table,&nbsp;then you can store or delete the address data as needed.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63483ad423421bd16e7a7ae7/639c39c9c67f66ae7839d8df_uber-h3-cells.png" alt="Uber H3 Cells" loading="lazy"></p></figure><p>Want to learn more about Spatial Indexes?

<p dir="auto">An attempt at reproducing a dynamic LOD in threejs similarly to unreal's nanite.
Very far from it but nonetheless a start.
<br>
For now it clusters a mesh (meshlets), then groups adjacent clusters into a group, merges the mesh (shared vertices), performs mesh simplification to half the triangles in the mesh (max 128) and finally it splits it into 2 (should be N/2).</p>

<p dir="auto">Regular expressions is a great tool for searching patterns in text. But I always found it unnatural for text editing. The <em>group</em> logic works as a post-processor and can be complicated. Here I propose an extension to the regular expression language for pattern matching and text modification. I call it <strong>transductive regular expressions</strong> or simply <strong><code>trre</code></strong>.</p>
<p dir="auto">It  introduces the <code>:</code> symbol to define transformations. The simplest form is <code>a:b</code>, which replaces a with b. I call this a <code>transductive pair</code> or <code>transduction</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">To demonstrate the concept, I have created a command line tool <strong><code>trre</code></strong>. It feels similar to the <code>grep -E</code> command.</p>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Language specification</h2><a id="user-content-language-specification" aria-label="Permalink: Language specification" href="#language-specification"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Informally, we define a <strong><code>trre</code></strong> as a pair <code>pattern-to-match</code>:<code>pattern-to-generate</code>. The <code>pattern-to-match</code> can be a string or regexp. The <code>pattern-to-generate</code> normally is a string. But it can be a <code>regex</code> as well. Moreover, we can do normal regular expression over these pairs.</p>
<p dir="auto">We can specify a smiplified grammar of <strong><code>trre</code></strong> as following:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="TRRE    <- TRRE* TRRE|TRRE TRRE.TRRE
TRRE    <- REGEX REGEX:REGEX"><pre><code>TRRE    &lt;- TRRE* TRRE|TRRE TRRE.TRRE
TRRE    &lt;- REGEX REGEX:REGEX
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Where <code>REGEX</code> is a usual regular expression, and <code>.</code> stands for concatenation.</p>
<p dir="auto">For now I consider the operator <code>:</code> as non-associative and the expression <code>TRRE:TRRE</code> as unsyntactical. There is a natural meaning for this expression as a composition of relations defined by **<code>trre</code>**s. But it can make things too complex. Maybe I change this later.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Why it works</h2><a id="user-content-why-it-works" aria-label="Permalink: Why it works" href="#why-it-works"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Under the hood, <strong><code>trre</code></strong> constructs a special automaton called a <strong>Finite State Transducer (FST)</strong>, which is similar to a <strong>Finite State Automaton (FSA)</strong> used in normal regular expressions but handles input-output pairs instead of plain strings.</p>
<p dir="auto">Key differences:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong><code>trre</code></strong> defines a binary relation between two regular languages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">It uses <strong>FST</strong>s instead of <strong>FSA</strong>s for inference.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">It supports on-the-fly determinization for performance (experimental and under construction!).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">To justify the laguage of trunsductive regular expression we need to prove the correspondence between <strong><code>trre</code></strong> expressions and the corresponding <strong>FST</strong>s. There is my sketch of a the proof: <a href="https://github.com/c0stya/trre/blob/main/doc/theory.pdf">theory.pdf</a>.</p>

<p dir="auto">There are tons of decisions:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">Associativity of <code>:</code>. The <code>:</code> symbol is non-associative, meaning a:b:c is invalid in the current version. There is a natural meaning of transducer composition but it could make things too complicated. Alternative syntaxes (e.g., &gt; and &lt;) could be explored.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Precedence of <code>:</code>. The priority of : in expressions needs clarification.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Implicit Epsilon: should there be an explicit symbol?</p>
</li>

<p dir="auto"><strong><code>trre</code></strong> supports two modes:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Scan Mode (default)</strong>: Applies transformations sequentially.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Match Mode</strong>: Checks the entire string against the expression (use <code>-m</code> flag).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Use <code>-a</code> to generate all possible outputs.</p>
<p dir="auto">The <code>? modifier makes </code>*<code>, </code>+<code>, and </code>{,}` operators non-greedy:</p>

<p dir="auto">The important part of the modern regex engines is determinization. This routine converts the non-deterministic automata to the deterministic one. Once converted it has linear time inference on the input string length. It is handy but the convertion is exponential in the worst case.</p>
<p dir="auto">For <strong><code>trre</code></strong> the similar approach is possible. The bad news is that not all the non-deterministic transducers (<strong>NFT</strong>) can be converted to a deterministic (<strong>DFT</strong>). In case of two "bad" cycles with same input labels the algorithm is trapped in the infinite loop of a state creation. There is a way to detect such loops but it is expensive (see more in <a href="https://cs.nyu.edu/~mohri/pub/twins.pdf" rel="nofollow">Allauzen, Mohri, Efficient Algorithms for testing the twins property</a>).</p>

A prominent theory in cognitive psychology suggests that learning maths in meaningful real-world contexts can complement maths learnt in the classroom and provide children with more generalizable and flexible arithmetic skills<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 15" title="Brown, J.

By learning and practising maths through relevant contexts, children may be better equipped to acquire the flexible cognitive skills they need to transfer maths knowledge across domains.</p><p>Under this hypothesis, children who work in markets might be expected to more easily learn the abstract maths taught in school. However, just as children who master abstract maths skills in school may fail to apply them to concrete problems, schools may fail to help children who adeptly use maths concepts in concrete situations in their daily lives to develop more abstract, generalizable skills. In the absence of such help, such skills may not automatically transfer across domains in either direction.</p><p>Here we ask whether, in the urban Indian context, the arithmetic skills that are used in market transactions transfer to the more abstract maths skills taught in school. Markets provide a particularly appropriate setting to ask this question because children who work in markets regularly perform maths in real-world activities that are culturally relevant and important to their lives. Moreover, these children are sufficiently engaged in these activities to be able to acquire meaningful maths competencies while often regularly attending school. We also ask whether children who attend school but without real-world experience of using arithmetic skills can translate the maths taught in schools to perform arithmetic operations in more concrete situations such as market transactions.</p><p>We surveyed a large number of children in urban India who were either attending or have attended school for years while also selling goods in markets. These children spent part of the day at school and part of the day at the market and therefore received exposure to arithmetic operations&nbsp;in both settings. In these studies, we analysed working children’s ability to use maths to compute payments as part of their daily job and their ability to generalize their knowledge, gained either in school or in the market, to new problems. We also surveyed large numbers of school children with no market-selling experience, which enabled us to benchmark working children’s performance and to test whether abstract maths knowledge by itself transfers across domains.</p></div></div><div id="Sec2-section" data-title="Working children effectively perform arithmetic operations"><h2 id="Sec2">Working children effectively perform arithmetic operations</h2><div id="Sec2-content"><p>In this study (study 1), we tested whether children working in markets are able to perform complex arithmetic calculations as part of their daily jobs. We surveyed 201 children in Kolkata, West Bengal, working in markets (see the section ‘Study 1’ of the <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="section anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08502-w#Sec15">Methods</a>). Undercover enumerators purchased unusual quantities of two goods from each child working at the store and paid with a bill that was worth more than the required amount. For example, the enumerators might ask how much 800 g of potatoes that the child sells at 20 rupees per kilogram costs and then how much 1.4 kg of onions that the child sells at 15 rupees per kilogram costs. They would then ask for the total cost (37 rupees in this case), before handing the child a 200 rupee note and collecting the change. Each of these steps was designed to measure the children’s applied arithmetic skills. Afterwards, the enumerators revealed their identity and asked the participants to complete a set of abstract maths exercises.</p><p>Most of these children effectively used arithmetic calculations in their jobs.

Moreover, in a subsequent interview, we presented children with a set of two hypothetical market maths problems of similar complexity to those of the market transactions but with different items and prices. Paper and pencil aids were made available to all the children.</p><p>Our results suggest that the arithmetic skills acquired in markets extended beyond rote memorization and were transferable to new problems within the realm of market transactions, but with some loss. On average, across both transactions, 52% of the children correctly solved the hypothetical transaction either on the first try or after self-correction despite the challenges of retaining new information about unfamiliar goods, prices and units (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08502-w#Fig1">1b</a> and Supplementary Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08502-w#MOESM1">1</a>). They did so without help, without the use of calculators and without using pen and paper.</p><p>However, despite their arithmetic competencies, these children struggled with school maths presented in abstract form. We presented the children with problems from India’s Annual Status of Education Report (ASER), which classifies children according to their oral answers to written problems of single-digit division with a remainder (taught in grade 4), double-digit subtraction with a remainder (taught in grade 2), recognition of two-digit numbers (taught in grade 1) and recognition of single-digit numbers (taught in kindergarten), administered with paper aids (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08502-w#Fig1">1d</a>).

This was despite the fact that only 13% of children reported that they had left school before the end of grade 4, when division is taught (Supplementary Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08502-w#MOESM1">3</a>), and almost all of them attended grade 2, when subtraction is taught.

This result suggests that children who work in markets are not differentially selected on school arithmetic skills.</p><p>The marked gap between the strong performance of the working children on real and hypothetical market transactions and their weak performance on the written exercises presented in school is unlikely to be explained by the difficulty of the underlying arithmetic calculations. If anything, the operations required by the market transactions were more difficult than those of the written arithmetic problems on the ASER, as the market transactions involved several operations.</p><p>Performance on abstract arithmetic problems remained poor when arithmetic problems with the same structure were orally presented. Only 3% of children could solve a new division problem like those on the ASER test when orally presented, and 43% could solve orally presented subtraction problems after two attempts (Supplementary Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08502-w#MOESM1">4</a>).

We did not find evidence that incentives affected their performance (<i>χ</i><sup>2</sup>(4, <i>n</i> = 400) = 2.01, <i>P</i> = 0.73; Extended Data Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08502-w#Tab4">3</a>).</p><p>To understand more precisely the effect of familiarity on the ability to conduct arithmetic calculations, we asked children five hypothetical market maths problems that became progressively more complex and further removed from their activity in the market that day. Performance declined for problems that required children to hold more new information in mind and to perform a sequence of operations. After one chance to self-correct for initial mistakes, 96% of these children correctly calculated the amount due in a transaction that involved the same goods that they sold at the same price that they sold it, and 88% did so when the price was different (<i>β</i> = 0.09, s.e.m. = 0.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.05–0.12, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001; Supplementary Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08502-w#MOESM1">9</a>). Children’s performance declined when a second item was added at a different price (69% correct, <i>β</i> = 0.19, s.e.m. = 0.03, 95% CI = 0.14–0.25, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001; Supplementary Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08502-w#MOESM1">9</a>), which required multiple operations and provided more opportunities for errors. Performance declined even further when the problems involved two goods sold using an unfamiliar pricing scheme, for example, by units rather than kilograms or vice versa (61% correct, <i>β</i> = 0.08, s.e.m. = 0.03, 95% CI = 0.01–0.14, <i>P</i> = 0.02; Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08502-w#Fig2">2b</a> and Supplementary Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08502-w#MOESM1">9</a>).</p><p>These declines in performance were accompanied by changes in the approach used by the children to solve the problem, with more reliance on pen and paper and techniques taught in school. When they worked with an item sold at their store, only 4% of children used pen and paper. As the transactions became less familiar and involved more operations, children increasingly relied on pen and paper: 29% with two goods sold in familiar&nbsp;units (<i>β</i> = –0.25, s.e.m. = 0.02, 95% CI = –0.30 to –0.20, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001; Extended Data Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08502-w#Tab5">4</a>), and 41% when it involved two goods sold in unfamiliar&nbsp;units (<i>β</i> = –0.12, s.e.m. = 0.03, 95% CI = –0.18 to –0.05, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001; Extended Data Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08502-w#Tab5">4</a> and Supplementary Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08502-w#MOESM1">10</a>). Finally, when the problems were presented with no concrete context, as are oral arithmetic operations in school, 58% of them used pen and paper (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08502-w#Fig3">3a</a>).</p></div></div><div id="Sec4-section" data-title="School children perform poorly on concrete problems"><h2 id="Sec4">School children perform poorly on concrete problems</h2><div id="Sec4-content"><p>Good arithmetic performance in market maths problems did not translate to good performance in school-like problems. Therefore, we asked whether proficiency in maths taught in schools transfer to real-world situations (study 2b). To that end, we surveyed 200 children attending 20 government schools in Delhi, located in the same zones as the markets from study 2a. These children, matched in age to the children working in markets in Delhi, were given the same written and verbal arithmetic problems as the working children, including the same school maths tests. We also created a play-based pretend market, in which the school children sold items to the enumerator, who presented them with the same hypothetical market maths problems given to the working children in Delhi.</p><p>The children in Delhi who were surveyed in schools and in markets differed in many respects, including their schooling history and their experience with markets (Extended Data Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08502-w#Tab6">5</a>). Twenty-two per cent of the non-working school children in study 2 had worked at a market, but only 1% of them had handled transactions. However, non-working children had attained, on average, a full grade level in school above that of the working children. Thus, differences in the arithmetic skills attained by these two groups captured not only the causal effect of attending school or working regularly but also the potential effect of selection for working in markets at a young age and the effect of an additional grade of school instruction, among other factors.</p><p>Non-working children solved simple abstract arithmetic problems with high accuracy when they were given unlimited time and pen and paper. Fifty-six per cent of children correctly answered&nbsp;the division portion of the written exercises presented abstractly, as in school (ASER test) (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08502-w#Fig2">2c</a> and Supplementary Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08502-w#MOESM1">7</a>). These proficiency rates were below grade-based expectations for grades 8 and 9, but they were above the performance of working children, of whom 15% correctly answered&nbsp;the division portion of the tests (<i>β</i> = 0.41, s.e.m. = 0.04, 95% CI = 0.34–0.47, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001; Supplementary Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08502-w#MOESM1">7</a>). Most of the non-working school children also correctly solved hypothetical transaction maths problems, regardless of whether the problem involved one or two goods.&nbsp;On average, they performed with 96% accuracy with one chance at self-correction (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08502-w#Fig2">2b</a> and Supplementary Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08502-w#MOESM1">11</a>).</p><p>Thus, non-working school children seemed to master basic arithmetic skills well. However, they performed poorly in the more concrete problems asked in the pretend market. About 60% of them could correctly calculate the amount due in market transactions (63%, 51% and 69% of the non-working school children correctly performed the first, second and third transactions, respectively, on the first or second try; Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08502-w#Fig2">2a</a> and Supplementary Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08502-w#MOESM1">5</a>).&nbsp;Furthermore, a comparison with working children is somewhat&nbsp;unfair, as the non-working children were able to use pen and paper and had no time limit.</p><p>Indeed, non-working school children relied heavily on pen and paper whenever given a chance: 96% of them used pen and paper on the ASER test and 74% of them used pen and paper for the hypothetical market transactions (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08502-w#Fig3">3a</a> and Supplementary Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08502-w#MOESM1">12</a>). An examination of the written work of the school children on all these untimed exercises suggested that most school children had not fully mastered the algorithms of elementary arithmetic (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08502-w#Fig3">3c</a> and Extended Data Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08502-w#Fig6">1</a>). On average, a non-working child wrote 102 numbers and 22 operations on their sheets of paper (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08502-w#Fig3">3b</a> and Supplementary Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08502-w#MOESM1">13</a>). Nearly half (46%) of these children repeated the same operation and 6% wrote the same operation in two different ways. Close to one-fifth (17%) of these children made extensive use of tally marks and serial numbers, converting addition problems to a process of counting by ones and/or converting multiplication problems to a process of counting by twos or fours (a strategy taught in grade 1). Even with the use of these strategies, non-working school children often had to rewrite or reframe the same problem several times before reaching a solution.</p><p>When faced with maths transactions in the simulated market, non-working school children did not change strategy (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08502-w#Fig3">3a</a>). Around two&nbsp;thirds of non-working children used pen and paper (whereas none of the working children did), and across the three transactions, 23% used repeated additions instead of multiplying, which was a significant difference from the working children for matched transactions (<i>β</i> = 0.18, s.e.m. = 0.02, 95% CI = 0.14–0.23, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001; Supplementary Tables <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08502-w#MOESM1">6</a> and&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08502-w#MOESM1">14</a>). For the pretend market maths problems, it seemed that these strategies were inadequate, perhaps because they involved several separate steps and the strategies adopted for each step took a long time to perform and combining different steps is yet another skill. However, in this study, we cannot rule out that the school children performed poorly because of the unfamiliar setting of the pretend market (for example, because they were excited by the game aspect).</p></div></div><div id="Sec5-section" data-title="Limited skill transfer is not explained by confounds"><h2 id="Sec5">Limited skill transfer is not explained by confounds</h2><div id="Sec5-content"><p>In this study (study 3), we asked why working children and school children performed so differently depending on the context in which a maths problem was presented. We conducted 835 surveys with working children in Delhi over two waves of data collection: March–April 2023 (wave 1) and February 2024 (wave 2). We also surveyed 271 children with no market-selling experience from nearby schools in November–December 2022 (along with wave 1 of the market survey).</p><p>Working children again performed well in their jobs.

The pretend market was set up in a similar manner as for study 2 but with a time limit, no use of pen and paper and problems matched in difficulty to what children who work in markets do. This set up enabled us to test children’s performance in a setting that most closely paralleled that in a market.

Conversely, school children do poorly in applied problems because they do not know any strategies other than those taught in school and they have not mastered those strategies sufficiently well to solve these more involved problems. It is possible, however, that the children’s performance was impaired by stress, stereotype threat or weak incentives to perform accurately, so we tested the effects of these factors.</p><h3 id="Sec7">Familiarity</h3><p>We asked whether the differences in performance reflect the impact of the presentation by itself or by anxiety induced by the lack of familiarity. It is conceivable that working children were anxious when confronted with a standard abstract problem that they would otherwise be able to solve. Alternatively, school children may have been anxious, or too excited to focus, when performing in the pretend market situation because they had never worked in a market.</p><p>To address this issue, we created a question that would feel familiar to both working and non-working children. We devised a concrete maths word&nbsp;problem presented in a format that is familiar to school children but mimicked the activity that working children perform. It is a story of a boy, Vishal, who goes to the market with 200 rupees and buys different quantities of two vegetables. The question is how much money Vishal is left with. Rounding could be used to simplify problems of the cost of both goods. We did not allow pen and paper for this question. This task has a familiar context for school children (who routinely solve word problems in school) and is a familiar task for the working children (who routinely perform this task in their work).</p><p>Working children outperformed school children on this market maths word&nbsp;problem. At the first attempt, 36% of working children correctly answered the question compared with 1% of non-working children (<i>β</i> = 0.35, s.e.m. = 0.03, 95% CI = 0.30–0.40, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001; Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08502-w#Fig4">4</a>, centre). When the first answer was incorrect, at the second attempt, a random subset of&nbsp;children were given a hint to break down the problem and to apply a rounding strategy. In such cases, 50% of the working children correctly answered the problem by their second attempt,&nbsp;compared with 5% of the non-working children (<i>β</i> = 0.45, s.e.m. = 0.05, 95% CI = 0.35–0.55, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001; Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08502-w#Fig4">4</a>, right). The working children calculated more fluently than the non-working children despite the attempt to render the problem equally familiar to both groups. We also did not find evidence that working children who also attended school performed better than those out of school on the market maths word&nbsp;problem (<i>β</i> = –0.02, s.e.m. = 0.05, 95% CI = –0.12 to 0.08, <i>P</i> = 0.730; Extended Data Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08502-w#Tab7">6</a>), although the working children who were still in school performed almost twice as well on abstract maths problems (<i>β</i> = 0.29, s.e.m. = 0.03, 95% CI = 0.22–0.36, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001; Extended Data Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08502-w#Tab7">6</a>). These results provide further evidence of the minimal skill transfer from school to real-world situations.</p><h3 id="Sec8">Stress and stereotype threat</h3><p>When working children were taken aside to answer questions in a school format, they may have felt threatened by it. It is possible that the situation induced stress or self-stereotyping (for example, ‘I am not good at school’). In study 3a, wave 1, we included a randomized experiment with four conditions to test for the impact of stress and stereotype threat on the performance of working children. In the first treatment (‘market maths problem first’), to put children at ease, we presented the hypothetical market maths problems before the oral abstract subtraction problems. The second treatment (‘encouragement’) aimed to vary the level of self-confidence of the children by having the surveyor use encouraging language during the survey versus without. We cross-randomized these treatments to produce four conditions.</p><p>At the end of the survey, we measured children’s stress levels using a series of Likert-scale questions. Both confidence-related treatments reduced the stress levels of working children but did not improve performance. Relative to the control group who received neither treatment, the market maths problem first group, the encouragement group and the group who received both treatments reported 0.17, 0.32 and 0.23 standard deviations less stress, respectively. However, we did not observe significant improvements in performance of solving abstract subtraction questions across any of the treatments: market maths problem first group (<i>β</i> = –0.20, s.e.m. = 0.15, 95% CI = –0.49 to 0.08, <i>P</i> = 0.163); encouragement group (<i>β</i> = –0.06, s.e.m. = 0.14, 95% CI = –0.34 to 0.22, <i>P</i> = 0.689); or&nbsp;market maths problem first with encouragement group (<i>β</i> = –0.16, s.e.m. = 0.15, 95% CI = –0.46 to 0.13, <i>P</i> = 0.272). Therefore we can reject small effects (Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08502-w#Tab1">1</a>).</p><div data-test="inline-table" data-container-section="table" id="table-1"><figure><figcaption><b id="Tab1" data-test="table-caption">Table 1 Impact of confidence treatments on stress and maths performance of working children in Delhi</b></figcaption><p><a data-test="table-link" data-track="click" data-track-action="view table" data-track-label="button" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08502-w/tables/1" aria-label="Full size table 1"><span>Full size table</span></a></p></figure></div><h3 id="Sec9">Incentives</h3><p>School children may face weaker incentives to correctly answer problems. So, we tested whether providing school children with material incentives improved their performance, by giving a random sample of children tokens to exchange for gifts. We did not find significant differences in performance across groups (<i>β</i> = 0.10, s.e.m. = 0.12, 95% CI = –0.14 to 0.34, <i>P</i> = 0.406; Extended Data Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08502-w#Tab8">7</a>).</p><h3 id="Sec10">Meaningfulness</h3><p>We randomized children to receive different versions of the survey so that we could test them on oral abstract and oral anchored problems that involved the same numbers. Working children performed significantly better on anchored problems, correctly answering 72% of anchored problems compared with 64% of abstract problems (<i>β</i> = 0.08, s.e.m. = 0.02, 95% CI = 0.03–0.12, <i>P</i>  = 0.001; Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08502-w#Fig5">5a</a> and Supplementary Tables <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08502-w#MOESM1">17</a> and <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08502-w#MOESM1">18</a>). By contrast, non-working children performed significantly worse on oral anchored addition and multiplication problems, correctly answering 73% of anchored problems and 78% of abstract problems (<i>β</i> = –0.06, s.e.m. = 0.03, 95% CI = –0.11 to –0.01, <i>P</i> = 0.028; Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08502-w#Fig5">5a</a> and Supplementary Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08502-w#MOESM1">18</a>). Thus, meaningfulness had differing effects on the performance of the two groups of children, a result consistent with the different contexts in which they learnt arithmetic skills.</p><div data-test="figure" data-container-section="figure" id="figure-5" data-title="Comparison of working and non-working children on abstract versus anchored and roundable versus non-roundable problems (study 3)."><figure><figcaption><b id="Fig5" data-test="figure-caption-text">Fig. 5: Comparison of working and non-working children on abstract versus anchored and roundable versus non-roundable problems (study 3).</b></figcaption><div><div><a data-test="img-link" data-track="click" data-track-label="image" data-track-action="view figure" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08502-w/figures/5" rel="nofollow"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41586-024-08502-w/MediaObjects/41586_2024_8502_Fig5_HTML.png?as=webp"><img aria-describedby="Fig5" src="https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41586-024-08502-w/MediaObjects/41586_2024_8502_Fig5_HTML.png" alt="figure 5" loading="lazy" width="685" height="599"></picture></a></div><div data-test="bottom-caption" id="figure-5-desc"><p><b>a</b>, The proportion of children who correctly answered abstract versus anchored problems.

Many children simplified calculations by using rounding and decomposition techniques that leverage the base-ten structure of the number system (44% when problems involved standard market prices and 36% when they involved new prices) (Supplementary Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08502-w#MOESM1">19</a>). They did so by converting complex operations (for example, 11 × 43) into a series of simpler ones (for example, solving 11 × 43 by converting the problem to (10 × 43) + 43). A large proportion (26% at market prices and 16% at new prices; Supplementary Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08502-w#MOESM1">19</a>) also used approximations to simplify calculations by rounding subtotals up or down by 1 or 5 (for example, approximating 0.7 kg of cauliflower at 20 rupees per kilogram to be 15 rupees). These methods may explain how working children solve complex problems so quickly and accurately without the need for pen and paper.</p><p>We then tested whether children leveraged these strategies on school-like abstract and anchored problems. We compared their performance on problems with an operand ending in 1 or 9 (roundable problems) with their performance on problems presenting numbers of similar sizes lacking those endings (non-roundable problems such as 12 × 42). Working children performed slightly better on roundable problems (67% correct) than on non-roundable problems, although the difference was not significant at the 5% level (64% correct, <i>β</i> = 0.03, s.e.m. = 0.02, 95% CI = 0.00–0.07, <i>P</i> = 0.083; Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08502-w#Fig5">5b</a> and Supplementary Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08502-w#MOESM1">20</a>). For non-working children, we did not see evidence of a difference: 75% answered roundable arithmetic questions correctly compared with 74% of non-roundable ones (<i>β</i> = 0.00, s.e.m. = 0.02, 95% CI = –0.04 to 0.05, <i>P</i> =  0.868; Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08502-w#Fig5">5b</a> and Supplementary Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08502-w#MOESM1">20</a>). It was notable that non-working school children did not use this structure, particularly as it forms the foundations of the arithmetic algorithms taught in school. Moreover, working children, who apparently discovered this structure over the course of their work in markets, had not mastered the school-taught algorithms that were based on it.</p><h3 id="Sec13">Hints</h3><p>In further experiments, we asked whether the differences between working and non-working school children are easily overridden or difficult to overturn. Because working children performed better on problems that were anchored to a familiar and concrete context, we asked whether they could improve their performance in abstract arithmetic problems by reframing them in such a context. Because school children did not seem to effectively use the base-ten system to simplify problems, and market children did so only to a limited extent, we asked whether children in both groups could be induced to use rounding to improve their calculations. We addressed these questions by including an experiment in which children were provided various hints.</p><p>For working children, we tested rounding and anchoring hints in two separate scenarios. Neither anchoring nor rounding hints had a significant impact on how accurately the children answered these problems, with treatment effects of –2 percentage points (<i>β</i> = –0.02, s.e.m. = 0.04, 95% CI = –0.09 to 0.05, <i>P</i> = 0.583; Extended Data Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08502-w#Fig7">2a</a> and Supplementary Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08502-w#MOESM1">21</a>) and 1 percentage point, respectively (<i>β</i> =  0.01, s.e.m. = 0.03, 95% CI = –0.06 to 0.07, <i>P</i> = 0.866; Extended Data Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08502-w#Fig7">2b</a> and Supplementary Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08502-w#MOESM1">22</a>). For non-working children, the hints were given in the context of the market maths word&nbsp;problem. They received hints to break down the problem and to use rounding strategies. Again, we did not find evidence that hints improved performance relative to those who only received a second chance (<i>β</i> = 0.00, s.e.m. = 0.03, 95% CI = –0.06 to 0.06, <i>P</i> = 0.881; Extended Data Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08502-w#Tab9">8</a> and Extended Data Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08502-w#Fig7">2c</a>). We conclude that by the time they reach adolescence, the cognitive differences between working and non-working children are not easily overturned.</p></div></div><div id="Sec14-section" data-title="Schools must bridge the gap between formal and intuitive maths"><h2 id="Sec14">Schools must bridge the gap between formal and intuitive maths</h2><div id="Sec14-content"><p>These studies provide evidence from three large groups of children from India that the majority of children working in markets are skilled in the arithmetic calculations used in their daily work. Moreover, they flexibly perform market transactions such that they rapidly adjust to correctly deal with transactions involving unusual quantities of the goods they sell. When tasked with a hypothetical transaction involving a change in price or items, most children performed correctly on the first try, and many of those who did not were correct on the second try. Even when presented with a complex market-inspired word problem involving four different operations, 35% correctly answered on the first try (and 50% succeeded after a chance at self-correction and a hint), which implied high levels of success at performing, sequencing and remembering each of the four arithmetic operations. By contrast, only 1% (<i>β</i> = 0.35, s.e.m. = 0.03, 95% CI = 0.30–0.40, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001; Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08502-w#Fig4">4</a>, centre) of the non-working children could solve the word problem in one try (5% with hints; <i>β</i> = 0.45, s.e.m. = 0.05, 95% CI = 0.35–0.55, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001; Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08502-w#Fig4">4</a>, right). We rule out confounding factors such as the possibility that the working children were chosen for their maths skills, that they received help from others, used calculation aids or had stronger incentives. It seems plausible that experience in markets, where goods change with seasonal factors, where prices change regularly across or within days and where there is always time pressure, leads children to discover flexible arithmetic strategies.</p><p>By contrast, we found little evidence that these real-world competencies helped children to perform school-based maths. Working children, most of whom were still in school (and the rest had attended school in the past) were not able to solve elementary written or oral abstract problems of subtraction and division as presented in school. This result is notable, particularly given that the algorithms taught in school are also based on the same base-ten compositional structure that working children use in solving the market maths problems that can be simplified by rounding to the nearest ten.</p><p>Conversely, non-working school children performed more accurately than working children in solving simple abstract problems taught in schools but poorly on concrete problems involving several simple operations, such as the ones routinely solved by working children. Moreover, their accuracy came at an extreme cost in speed. That is, many school children solved simple multiplication problems, such as 24 × 8, by rewriting them as longer addition problems (here, a problem with eight two-digit addends) or still longer counting problems (here, by tallying and counting the numbers of twos and ones in the written addition problem). Thus, neither group of children had developed the maths skills required for further study in maths, science and many other disciplines.</p><p>These findings point to a broader failure of the pedagogical practices in India to make usable connections between intuitive and formal understanding of maths ideas. The pedagogy in place does not teach school students strategies to do maths in real-world settings. It also does not take advantage of the fact that working children have developed such strategies on their own to help them bridge their specific skill sets, well-tailored to the markets, to the skills needed to succeed in a school-based setting. This failure echoes the finding from a randomized control trial (RCT) of low-income preschool children in Delhi<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 20" title="Dillon, M.

We present these results with and without controls. To calculate standardized indices (for example, when measuring stress), we first standardized the individual outcomes that make up a given index, averaged them and then standardized the final variable to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. We conducted all of our analyses in Stata and plotted figures in R.</p><h3 id="Sec17">Study 1</h3><h4 id="Sec18">Sample</h4><p>There is no list of all informal (wholesale and retail) markets that employ children in India because child labour is illegal. Therefore we drew a convenience sample of markets in all studies. In study 1, we identified potential markets and then visited them to verify that they employed children. This process identified 92 markets. We drew a convenience sample of working children at each market. An enumerator walked around each market and noted where children were located. We only approached children who appeared to be 16 years of age or younger, were selling goods and sold more than one good. We did, however, stop the survey if we discovered that the child was 18 years of age&nbsp;or older. This led us to include some children who were 17 years of age. In study 1, 201 out of 285 working children whom we approached agreed to participate. Given that the vast majority of children consented to participate, selection on who consents is unlikely to be driving our results, although we cannot rule this out entirely. Of these children, 141 were enrolled in school (average grade attained at the time of testing, 6.24) and 60 were not (average grade attained, 3.67) (Supplementary Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08502-w#MOESM1">3</a>).</p><h4 id="Sec19">Survey structure</h4><p>For study 1, our survey consisted of the following sections: (1) market transactions; (2) consent; (3) ASER written assessment; (4) oral abstract and anchored assessment; (5) hypothetical transactions; and (6) demographics.</p><h4 id="Sec20">Market transactions</h4><p>In the market transactions section, each working child was approached by two enumerators dressed as regular buyers who purchased two goods (for example, 300 g of beans and 200 g of peas). When goods were sold by the unit (for example, bananas), enumerators bought them by the unit. When they were sold by the kilogram (for example, tomatoes), enumerators bought them by the kilogram or gram. In both cases, enumerators avoided purchasing common quantities (for example, 1 kg or 500 g or 1–2 units) to minimize the probability that children had memorized the prices of the quantities requested.</p><p>When a child told the enumerators the amount due, they were asked how they had arrived at that total (for example, by an enumerator who said, ‘I expected it to be less’), which prompted the child to explain their calculation. If the calculation was correct, the enumerators paid and left. If it was incorrect, the enumerators asked the child to verify their calculation (for example, saying ‘Are you sure? How did you get that? Do it again and see’). Regardless of whether the child’s calculation of the amount due was correct, the enumerators offered more money than was due, took the change and left. The use of calculators, paper aids and help from adults was permitted but the enumerator kept a record of each.</p><p>In studies 1 and 2a, two other pairs of undercover enumerators repeated the same process, resulting in three transactions per child. One of the three pairs of enumerators revealed their identity and invited the child to participate in the study.</p><h4 id="Sec21">ASER</h4><p>The ASER is a survey of learning outcomes for school-aged children conducted annually by Pratham, a non-governmental organization in India. ASER is representative of rural India, although in some years, it was also conducted in select urban areas.</p><h3 id="Sec22">Study 2a</h3><h4 id="Sec23">Sample</h4><p>We followed a similar process for identifying children and markets as in study 1. In this study, we conducted the main survey after the first market transaction. We later returned with undercover enumerators to complete the second and third transactions. Of the 442 working children approached, 400 agreed to participate and 344 completed all three transactions (Extended Data Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08502-w#Tab3">2</a>)</p><h4 id="Sec24">Survey structure</h4><p>The survey consisted of the following sections: (1) market transactions (as in study 1); (2) consent; (3) ASER written assessment (as in study 1); (4) oral abstract and anchored assessment (as in study 1); (5) hypothetical transactions; (6) roundable problems for a subsample of 85 children; and (6) demographics.</p><h4 id="Sec25">Rounding prices in the market</h4><p>It is common practice for shopkeepers in markets in India to round prices up or down by one or to the nearest multiple of five. In studies 2 and 3, for all market transactions (for working children), pretend market transactions (for school children) and hypothetical transactions (for working and non-working children), we considered the price quoted for an individual good to be correct if it was rounded up or down by one from the exact answer, rounded up or down by five from the exact answer or the exact answer itself. For example, if the exact answer was 35.5 rupees, we would treat 30, 35, 35.5, 36 and 40 as correct answers. We did this because such rounding is common practice and does not reflect the inability of the child to solve problems.</p><p>For the combined price of goods 1 and goods 2, we considered any answer that adds the correct (rounded or unrounded) prices of individual goods to be correct. For example, if carrots cost 18 rupees and potatoes cost 32 rupees, we would consider a total price of 52 rupees to be a correct answer; 18 rupees can be correctly rounded to 20 rupees, and 20 rupees plus 32 rupees gives a total of 52 rupees.</p><p>For the change provided, we calculated the correct answer by subtracting the true cost of each good from the cash provided (not by subtracting the amount quoted by the child from the cash provided). For example, if we purchased 600 g of apples at 30 rupees per kg and 200 g of potatoes at 20 rupees per kg and gave the child 200 rupees, then we would calculate the exact answer as 200 – (0.6)(30) – (0.2)(20) = 200 – 18 – 4 = 178, irrespective of what the child quoted for the total amount due. We also allowed the same rounding as described for the combined price of goods 1 and goods 2. For example, we would also treat 200 – 20 – 5 = 175 to be correct.</p><h4 id="Sec26">Hypothetical transactions</h4><p>In study 2a, there were five hypothetical transactions that varied one aspect of the transaction at a time. For example, for a child who sold carrots by the kilogram that day, the first would be a hypothetical problem focused on selling carrots at the familiar price by kilogram. The second problem would be selling carrots at a new price by kilogram, the third, selling carrots at the same new price by kilogram and a second unfamiliar good sold at a new price by kilogram. The fourth problem would be selling a new good, for example bananas, at a new price by units, and finally, selling bananas at the same new price by units and a second unfamiliar good at a new price by units (see&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08502-w#MOESM1">Supplementary Methods</a>, study 2a, for more details and examples of the problems). We provided children with pen and paper.</p><h4 id="Sec27">Incentive randomization</h4><p>Each child was randomly assigned to two versions of the exercises: a version that offered them 10 rupees for every exercise that they answered correctly (in addition to the 200 rupees for participating) and a version that did not offer any incentives.</p><h4 id="Sec28">Roundable problems</h4><p>In study 2, a subset of 85 working children were given four exercises explicitly designed to encourage the use of decomposition and repeated grouping. To give children maximum latitude to reveal their sensitivity to the base-ten structure, paper and pencil aids were made available to them. In all other respects, the problems mirrored those of the abstract and anchored arithmetic problems from the preceding test. They were not provided any hint that this was a possible strategy to follow. We present the results in Supplementary Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08502-w#MOESM1">23</a>.</p><h4 id="Sec29">Solution methods</h4><p>We collected all the sheets of paper that working children used during the written exercises, hypothetical transactions and roundable problems. We developed a coding system to characterize the calculation strategies used by these children (for example, the number of numbers that children wrote on the page, whether they used tallies or serial numbers, among others) and asked data-entry operators to use these codes to enter data on every sheet of paper. Every sheet was coded twice by two different data-entry operators to identify and correct any inconsistencies in data entry.</p><h3 id="Sec30">Study 2b</h3><h4 id="Sec31">Sample</h4><p>In study 2b, in July–August of 2017, we surveyed 200 children attending 20 government schools located in a 2-km radius of the markets we identified. We selected ten children at random from grade 8 and ten children from grade 9. All school children agreed to participate.</p><h4 id="Sec32">Survey structure</h4><p>Study 2b consisted of the following sections: (1) consent; (2) pretend market transactions; (3) ASER written assessment (as in study 2a); (4) oral abstract and anchored assessment (as in study 2a); (5) hypothetical transactions (as in study 2a) and roundable problems (as in study 2a); and (6) demographics. We recorded solution methods as in study 2a.</p><h4 id="Sec33">Pretend market transactions</h4><p>We set up a pretend market in classrooms with plastic goods and money. We told children to imagine they were selling items in a shop and that the surveyor was a customer. We randomized children to sell by kilograms or units. We asked the child to go to the desk at the front of the classroom and select any two items that they wanted to sell. We then checked the goods that they selected had different prices and explained to the child that the prices written were sold per kilogram or by unit. Children were then given plastic money of 300 rupees in small change and told that they could use pen and paper during the transaction if needed. We then followed the same process we used with working children, performing three separate transactions.</p><h3 id="Sec34">Study 3a, wave 1</h3><h4 id="Sec35">Sample</h4><p>We followed a similar sampling strategy to study 2a. Of the 489 working children who completed a market transaction with one of our surveyors, 372 agreed to participate and completed the full survey. We present the characteristics of our study 3 sample in Supplementary Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08502-w#MOESM1">24</a>.</p><h4 id="Sec36">Survey structure</h4><p>Study 3a, wave 1 consisted of the following sections: (1) market transactions (as in studies 1 and 2a); (2) consent; (3) hypothetical transactions and calculation explanations; (4) oral abstract subtraction and hints (with the order of (3) and (4) randomized); (5) market maths word&nbsp;problem; (6) market maths word&nbsp;problem with hints; (7) oral abstract division; and (8) demographics and stress measures.</p><h4 id="Sec37">Hypothetical transactions and calculation explanations</h4><p>We asked children two hypothetical transaction questions. They were allowed to attempt the question twice if they were initially incorrect. After each question, we asked children how they solved the problem. We audio-recorded their response, transcribed it and then categorized the solution method they used.</p><h4 id="Sec38">Market maths word&nbsp;problem</h4><p>We gave children a problem that was presented in a format that was familiar to school children but mimics the activity that working children do. Rounding could be used to simplify the cost of both goods. We did not allow pen and paper. The problem read: “Vishal went to the market with 200 rupees. He bought 450 grams of peas at 100 rupees a kilogram, and 200 grams of tomatoes at 90 rupees a kilogram. How much money does he have left?”.</p><h4 id="Sec39">Confidence treatments</h4><p>In previous work, we found that children who performed well in arithmetic&nbsp;operations in the course of their job did not do well when solving standard arithmetic calculations when presented in a school-maths formulation. Two possible reasons for this are that children become stressed or lose confidence when they are presented with problems in a setting they are not familiar with. To test this hypothesis, we introduced two cross-randomized treatment variations. The first treatment varied whether oral abstract subtraction problems were presented before or after the hypothetical market maths problems. If abstract problems cause stress and stress impairs performance, then children who completed the abstract problems first will be more stressed while completing the abstract and hypothetical market maths problems and perform less well. The second treatment attempted to vary the level of self-confidence of the children by having the surveyor use more or less encouraging language during the survey. Specifically, we began by telling children we were interested in how children who work in markets ‘manage to be so exceptionally good at doing mental calculations’ versus ‘manage to do mental calculations in the course of their work, but often do poorly in school’.</p><h4 id="Sec40">Stress measures</h4><p>As a first-stage measure for the confidence treatments, we measured children’s stress, confidence and attitudes to maths at the end of the survey.</p><h3 id="Sec41">Study 3a, wave 2</h3><h4 id="Sec42">Sample</h4><p>We returned to 34 out of the 38 markets we visited in study 3a, wave 1. We did not conduct a real market transaction with children in this study. However, we used a similar strategy to recruit children to ensure a comparable sample. As in previous studies, surveyors spent time observing children to determine whether they were handling transactions at their shop (calculating prices and providing change). If they appeared to be doing so, surveyors approached the child and enquired about the price of a good at a specific quantity. For example, asking ‘How much do 300 g of apples cost?’. If the child did not answer the question and had someone else in the shop answer on their behalf, we assumed that the child did not handle transactions and did not begin the survey with them. As a final check, we also directly asked children at the beginning of the survey whether they handled transactions and screened them out of the study if they did not. Of the 566 working children who were approached by one of our surveyors, 463 passed these screens, agreed to participate and completed the full survey.</p><h4 id="Sec43">Survey structure</h4><p>Our survey consisted of the following sections: (1) consent; (2) simple arithmetic and confidence building; (3) hypothetical transaction; (4) warm-up abstract and anchored addition and multiplication arithmetic calculations; (5) oral abstract subtraction with anchoring hints; (6) oral abstract and anchored multiplication with rounding hints; (7) process hints; and (8) demographics.</p><h4 id="Sec44">Warm-up abstract and anchored addition and multiplication arithmetic operations</h4><p>We asked children a series of oral addition and multiplication problems. Some of the problems were abstractly framed whereas others were anchored to a concrete context. This section served several purposes. First, it put children further at ease before they began the hint sections of the survey. Second, we randomized children into five groups who were given differing numbers of problems (ranging from two problems to six problems). This provided random variation for the position that questions appeared within the survey, which controlled for question order effects in our subsequent hint experiments. Finally, we compared performance on abstract and anchored problems. We randomized children into two versions of the test to exactly balance problem difficulty on abstract and anchored problems. We also provided a mix of roundable and non-roundable problems of similar difficulty.</p><h4 id="Sec45">Hint experiments</h4><p>We include a detailed summary of the anchoring, rounding and process hint experiment methods in the&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08502-w#MOESM1">Supplementary Methods</a> (study 3a), with results in Extended Data Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08502-w#Tab9">8</a>, Extended Data Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08502-w#Fig7">2</a> and Supplementary Tables <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08502-w#MOESM1">21</a>, <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08502-w#MOESM1">22</a> and <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08502-w#MOESM1">25</a>.</p><h3 id="Sec46">Study 3b</h3><h4 id="Sec47">Identification of schools</h4><p>We followed a similar sampling strategy to study 2b. We surveyed a total of 300 children, half in grade 7 and half in grade 8. All children we approached agreed to participate. Our main analysis focused on the 271 school children with no market-selling experience.</p><h4 id="Sec48">Survey structure</h4><p>For study 3b, our survey consisted of the following sections: (1) consent; (2) ASER (as in studies 1 and 2; Supplementary Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08502-w#MOESM1">26</a>); (3) written abstract, oral abstract and oral anchored assessment; (4) market maths word&nbsp;problem (as in study 3a, wave 1); (5) pretend market problem (as in study 3a, wave 1); and (6) market maths word&nbsp;problem with hints.</p><h4 id="Sec49">Written abstract, oral abstract and oral anchored assessment</h4><p>We tested how school children’s arithmetic performance changed depending on how questions were delivered by asking questions in written abstract, oral abstract and oral anchored forms. For each of these sections, we tested children on one addition, subtraction, multiplication and division question. Other than the key feature, we balanced the complexity of the problems across these sections by randomizing children into one of four versions of the survey. For example, across the versions, children were tested on oral abstract and oral anchored problems with the exact same numbers. We also balanced the difficulty of roundable and non-roundable problems by ensuring they had similar numerical quantities and the same requirements to carry over numbers.</p><h4 id="Sec50">Pretend market transactions</h4><p>We again set up a pretend market in children’s classrooms but made several changes relative to study 2 to test children’s performance in a setting that most closely parallels selling in a market. In particular, we designed the problem to be of comparable difficulty to the real-world market transactions, did not allow children to use pen and paper and required children to respond in 4 min or less.</p><h4 id="Sec51">Market maths word&nbsp;problem with hints</h4><p>We tested whether providing a hint to use rounding strategies improves performance for non-working children, who may underutilize flexible arithmetic algorithms. There were two treatment groups: one received a hint to break down the problem; the other received a&nbsp;hint&nbsp;to both break down the problem and to use rounding strategies. Finally, the control group could re-attempt the problem without a hint.</p><h4 id="Sec52">Incentives</h4><p>All children received tokens on the basis of&nbsp;whether they correctly answered the questions. We randomized whether children could exchange these tokens for non-financial gifts (incentives treatment) or whether children received a fixed gift (no incentives treatment).</p><h3 id="Sec53">Reporting summary</h3><p>Further information on research design is available in the&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08502-w#MOESM2">Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary</a> linked to this article.</p></div></div>

    <p>All known human languages display a surprising pattern: the most frequent word in a language is twice as frequent as the second most frequent, three times as frequent as the third, and so on. This is known as Zipf’s law. </p>

<p>Researchers have hunted for evidence of this pattern in communication among other species, but until now no other examples have been found.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adq7055">new research</a> published today in Science, our team of experts in whale song, linguistics and developmental psychology analysed eight years’ of song recordings from humpback whales in New Caledonia. Led by Inbal Arnon from the Hebrew University, Ellen Garland from the University of St Andrews, and Simon Kirby from the University of Edinburgh, We used techniques inspired by the way human infants learn language to analyse humpback whale song. </p>

<p>We discovered that the same Zipfian pattern universally found across human languages also occurs in whale song. This complex signalling system, like human language, is culturally learned by each individual from others.</p>

<h2>Learning like an infant</h2>

<p>When infant humans are learning, they have to somehow discover where words start and end. Speech is continuous and does not come with gaps between words that they can use. So how do they break into language? </p>

<p><a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.274.5294.1926">Thirty years of research</a> has revealed that they do this by listening for sounds that are surprising in context: sounds within words are relatively predictable, but between words are relatively unpredictable. We analysed the whale song data using the same procedure.</p>

<p>Unexpectedly, using this technique revealed in whale song the same statistical properties that are found in all languages. It turns out both human language and whale song have statistically coherent parts.</p>

<p>In other words, they both contain recurring parts where the transitions between elements are more predictable within the part. Moreover, these recurring sub-sequences we detected follow the Zipfian frequency distribution found across all human languages, and not found before in other species. </p>

<p>How do the same statistical properties arise in two evolutionarily distant species that differ from one another in so many ways? We suggest we found these  similarities because humans and whales share a learning mechanism: culture.  </p>

<h2>A cultural origin</h2>

<p>Our findings raise an exciting question: why would such different systems in such incredibly distant species have common structures? We suggest the reason behind this is that both are culturally learned. </p>

<p>Cultural evolution inevitably leads to the emergence of <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0707835105">properties that make learning easier</a>. If a system is hard to learn, it will not survive to the next generation of learners. </p>

<p>There is <a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0010027722000269">growing evidence</a> from <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-56152-9">experiments with humans</a> that having statistically coherent parts, and having them follow a Zipfian distribution, makes learning easier. This suggests that learning and transmission play an important role in how these properties emerged in both human language and whale song.</p>

<h2>So can we talk to whales now?</h2>

<p>Finding parallel structures between whale song and human language may also lead to another question: can we talk to whales now? The short answer is no, not at all. </p>

<p>Our study does not examine the meaning behind whale song sequences. We have no idea what these segments might mean to the whales, if they mean anything at all. </p>

<p>It might help to think about it like instrumental music, as music also contains similar structures. A melody can be learned, repeated, and spread – but that doesn’t give meaning to the musical notes in the same way that individual words have meaning.</p>

<h2>Next up: birdsong</h2>

<p>Our work also makes a bold prediction: we should find this Zipfian distribution wherever complex communication is transmitted culturally. Humans and whales are not the only species that do this. </p>

<p>We find what is known as “vocal production learning” in an unusual range of species across the animal kingdom. Song birds in particular may provide the best place to look as many bird species culturally learn their songs, and unlike in whales, we know a lot about precisely <a href="https://doi.org/10.1196/annals.1298.026">how birds learn song</a>. </p>

<p>Equally, we expect not to find these statistical properties in the communication of species that don’t transmit complex communication by learning. This will help to reveal whether cultural evolution is the common driver of these properties between humans and whales.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          
<p>Emails discussing torrenting prove that Meta knew it was "illegal," authors alleged. And Bashlykov's warnings seemingly landed on deaf ears, with authors alleging that evidence showed Meta chose to instead hide its torrenting as best it could while downloading and seeding terabytes of data from multiple shadow libraries as recently as April 2024.</p>
<h2>Meta allegedly concealed seeding</h2>
<p>Supposedly, Meta tried to conceal the seeding by not using Facebook servers while downloading the dataset to "avoid" the "risk" of anyone "tracing back the seeder/downloader" from Facebook servers, an <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.415175/gov.uscourts.cand.415175.417.9.pdf">internal message</a> from Meta researcher Frank Zhang said, while describing the work as in "stealth mode." Meta also allegedly modified settings "so that the smallest amount of seeding possible could occur," a Meta executive in charge of project management, Michael Clark, said in a <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.415175/gov.uscourts.cand.415175.417.8.pdf">deposition</a>.</p>
<p>Now that new information has come to light, authors claim that Meta staff involved in the decision to torrent LibGen must be deposed again, because allegedly the new facts "contradict prior deposition testimony."</p>
<p>Mark Zuckerberg, for example, claimed to have no involvement in decisions to use LibGen to train AI models. But unredacted messages show the "decision to use LibGen occurred" after "a prior escalation to MZ," authors alleged.</p>
<p>Meta did not immediately respond to Ars' request for comment and has maintained throughout the litigation that AI training on LibGen was "fair use."</p>
<p>However, Meta has previously addressed its torrenting in a <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Kadrey-v-Meta-motion-to-dismiss-1-31-25.pdf">motion to dismiss</a> filed last month, telling the court that "plaintiffs do not plead a single instance in which any part of any book was, in fact, downloaded by a third party from Meta via torrent, much less that Plaintiffs’ books were somehow distributed by Meta."</p>
<p>While Meta may be confident in its legal strategy despite the new torrenting wrinkle, the social media company has seemingly complicated its case by allowing authors to expand the distribution theory that's key to winning a direct copyright infringement claim beyond just claiming that Meta's AI outputs unlawfully distributed their works.</p>
<p>As limited discovery on Meta's seeding now proceeds, Meta is not fighting the seeding aspect of the direct copyright infringement claim at this time, telling the court that it plans to "set... the record straight and debunk... this meritless allegation on summary judgment."</p>

Just trees, a few roughly built cement buildings, and a long-running civil war which has left this area of Myanmar one of the poorest places on earth. But today, on this spot along the border with Thailand, a small city has emerged like a mirage. It is called Shwe Kokko, or Golden Raintree.</p><p>It is accused of being a city built on scams, home to a lucrative yet deadly nexus of fraud, money-laundering and human trafficking. The man behind it, She Zhijiang, is languishing in a Bangkok jail, awaiting extradition to China.</p><p>But Yatai, She Zhijiang's company which built the city, paints a very different vision of Shwe Kokko in its promotional videos – as a resort city, a safe holiday destination for Chinese tourists and haven for the super-rich.</p><p>The story of Shwe Kokko is also one of the unbridled ambition which has rippled out of China in the last two decades.</p><p>She Zhijiang dreamed of building this glittering city as his ticket out of the shadowy world of scams and gambling which he inhabited.</p><p>But by aiming so high he has drawn the attention of Beijing, which is now keen to stamp out the fraud operations along the Thai-Myanmar border which are increasingly targeting Chinese people.</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><picture><source srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/2536/live/f821ba70-e502-11ef-be41-9d8a7ab0ece0.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/2536/live/f821ba70-e502-11ef-be41-9d8a7ab0ece0.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/2536/live/f821ba70-e502-11ef-be41-9d8a7ab0ece0.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/2536/live/f821ba70-e502-11ef-be41-9d8a7ab0ece0.jpg.webp 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/2536/live/f821ba70-e502-11ef-be41-9d8a7ab0ece0.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/2536/live/f821ba70-e502-11ef-be41-9d8a7ab0ece0.jpg.webp 976w" type="image/webp"><img alt="Tall buildings in Myanmar's Myawaddy seen from Thailand's border, where armed guards stand on a bridge  " loading="lazy" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/1504/cpsprodpb/2536/live/f821ba70-e502-11ef-be41-9d8a7ab0ece0.jpg" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/2536/live/f821ba70-e502-11ef-be41-9d8a7ab0ece0.jpg 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/2536/live/f821ba70-e502-11ef-be41-9d8a7ab0ece0.jpg 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/2536/live/f821ba70-e502-11ef-be41-9d8a7ab0ece0.jpg 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/2536/live/f821ba70-e502-11ef-be41-9d8a7ab0ece0.jpg 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/2536/live/f821ba70-e502-11ef-be41-9d8a7ab0ece0.jpg 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/2536/live/f821ba70-e502-11ef-be41-9d8a7ab0ece0.jpg 976w" width="1504" height="847.0107526881721"></picture></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>Jonathan Head/BBC</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>New high-rises on the Myanmar side are visible from Thailand's border</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Publicity about the scams is also hurting Thai tourism – Thailand is shutting down power to compounds over the border, toughening its banking rules and promising to block visas for those suspected of using Thailand as a transit route.</p><p>Shwe Kokko has been left marooned in post-coup, war-wracked Myanmar, unable to bring in the flow of investment and visitors it needs to keep going.</p><p>Yatai is trying to fix the city's sinister image by allowing journalists to see it, holding out hope that more favourable reporting might even get She Zhijiang out of jail.</p><p>So they invited the BBC to Shwe Kokko.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Getting there is tricky.</p><p>Ever since construction began in 2017, Shwe Kokko has been a forbidden place, off-limits to casual visitors.</p><p>As the civil war in Myanmar escalated after the 2021 military coup, access became even more difficult. It takes three days from the country's commercial hub Yangon – through multiple checkpoints, blocked roads and a real risk of getting caught in armed skirmishes. Crossing from Thailand takes just a few minutes, but requires careful planning to avoid Thai police and army patrols.</p><p>She Zhijiang's colleagues took us on a tour, highlighting the newly paved streets, the luxury villas, the trees – "Mr She believes in making a green city," they told us. Our guide was Wang Fugui, who said he was a former police officer from Guangxi in southern China. He ended up in prison in Thailand, on what he insists were trumped-up fraud charges. There he got to know She Zhijiang and became one of his most trusted lieutenants.</p><p>At first glance, Shwe Kokko has the appearance of a provincial Chinese city. The signs on the buildings are written in Chinese characters, and there is a constant procession of Chinese-made construction vehicles going to and from building sites.</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><picture><source srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/921c/live/d47c9ae0-e4ee-11ef-96f0-05bccc1c0c08.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/921c/live/d47c9ae0-e4ee-11ef-96f0-05bccc1c0c08.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/921c/live/d47c9ae0-e4ee-11ef-96f0-05bccc1c0c08.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/921c/live/d47c9ae0-e4ee-11ef-96f0-05bccc1c0c08.jpg.webp 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/921c/live/d47c9ae0-e4ee-11ef-96f0-05bccc1c0c08.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/921c/live/d47c9ae0-e4ee-11ef-96f0-05bccc1c0c08.jpg.webp 976w" type="image/webp"><img alt="A man riding past a red sign saying 'Let's build a beautiful home together'  " loading="lazy" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/1504/cpsprodpb/921c/live/d47c9ae0-e4ee-11ef-96f0-05bccc1c0c08.jpg" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/921c/live/d47c9ae0-e4ee-11ef-96f0-05bccc1c0c08.jpg 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/921c/live/d47c9ae0-e4ee-11ef-96f0-05bccc1c0c08.jpg 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/921c/live/d47c9ae0-e4ee-11ef-96f0-05bccc1c0c08.jpg 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/921c/live/d47c9ae0-e4ee-11ef-96f0-05bccc1c0c08.jpg 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/921c/live/d47c9ae0-e4ee-11ef-96f0-05bccc1c0c08.jpg 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/921c/live/d47c9ae0-e4ee-11ef-96f0-05bccc1c0c08.jpg 976w" width="1504" height="846.5081081081081"></picture></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>Jonathan Head/ BBC</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>With signs written in Chinese characters, Yatai has the appearance of a Chinese city</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Yatai is vague about the tenants of all its buildings, as it is about many things. "Rich people, from many countries, they rent the villas," they told us. And what about the businesses? "Many businesses. Hotels, casinos."</p><p>However, most of the people we saw were local Karen, one of Myanmar's ethnic minorities, who come into Shwe Kokko every day to work. We saw very few of the overseas visitors who are supposed to be the customers of the hotels and casinos.</p><p>Yatai says there are no more scams in Shwe Kokko. It has put up huge billboards all over town proclaiming, in Chinese, Burmese and English, that forced labour was not allowed, and that "online businesses" should leave. But we were quietly told by local people that the scam business was still running.</p><p>Starting a decade ago in the unchecked frenzy of Chinese investment on the Cambodian coast, then moving to the lawless badlands of Myanmar's border with China, the scam operators have now settled along the Thai-Myanmar border. Around them, the Myanmar military and a hotch-potch of rebel armies and warlords are fighting for control of Karen State.</p><p>The scams have grown into a multi-billion dollar business. They involve thousands of workers from China, South East Asia, Africa and the Indian subcontinent kept in walled-off compounds where they defraud people all over the world of their savings.</p><p>Some work there willingly, but others are abducted and forced to work. Those who have escaped have told harrowing stories of torture and beatings. Some have come from Shwe Kokko.</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><picture><source srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/f385/live/febf4730-e480-11ef-89a1-3f5b746fc0a2.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/f385/live/febf4730-e480-11ef-89a1-3f5b746fc0a2.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/f385/live/febf4730-e480-11ef-89a1-3f5b746fc0a2.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/f385/live/febf4730-e480-11ef-89a1-3f5b746fc0a2.jpg.webp 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/f385/live/febf4730-e480-11ef-89a1-3f5b746fc0a2.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/f385/live/febf4730-e480-11ef-89a1-3f5b746fc0a2.jpg.webp 976w" type="image/webp"><img alt="A vehicle inside the city.

She had not enjoyed it and been allowed to leave.</p><p>Her job, she said, was as part of the modelling team, made up mostly of attractive young women, who contact potential victims and try to build an intimate online relationship with them.</p><p>"The target is the elderly," she said. "You start a conversation like 'oh you look just like one of my friends'. Once you make friends you encourage them by sending pictures of yourself, sometimes wearing your night clothes."</p><p>Then, she explains, the conversation moves to get-rich-quick schemes, such as crypto investments, with the women claiming that's how they made a lot of money.</p><p>"When they feel close to you, you pass them on to the chatting section," she says. "The chatting people will continue messaging with the client, persuading them to buy shares in the crypto company."</p><p>During our brief time in Shwe Kokko we were only allowed to see what Yatai wanted us to see. Even so, it was evident that the scams have not stopped, and are probably still the main business in the city.</p><p>Our request to see inside any of the newly built office buildings was turned down. Those are private, they kept telling us. We were escorted at all times by security guards seconded from the militia group which controls this part of the border. </p><p>We were allowed to film the construction work, and the outsides of the buildings, but not to enter them.

        <p>Today we released our <a href="https://source.coop/repositories/harvard-lil/gov-data/description">archive of data.gov</a> on Source Cooperative. The 16TB collection includes over 311,000 datasets harvested during 2024 and 2025, a complete archive of federal public datasets linked by data.gov. It will be updated daily as new datasets are added to data.gov.</p>

<p>This is the first release in our new <a href="https://lil.law.harvard.edu/blog/2025/01/30/preserving-public-u-s-federal-data/">data vault project</a> to preserve and authenticate vital public datasets for academic research, policymaking, and public use.</p>

<p>We’ve built this project on our long-standing commitment to preserving government records and making public information available to everyone. Libraries play an essential role in safeguarding the integrity of digital information. By preserving detailed metadata and establishing digital signatures for authenticity and provenance, we make it easier for researchers and the public to cite and access the information they need over time.</p>

<p>In addition to the data collection, we are releasing <a href="https://github.com/harvard-lil/data-vault">open source software and documentation</a> for replicating our work and creating similar repositories. With these tools, we aim not only to preserve knowledge ourselves but also to empower others to save and access the data that matters to them.</p>

<p>For suggestions and collaboration on future releases, please contact us at lil@law.harvard.edu.</p>

<p>This project builds on our work with the <a href="https://perma.cc/">Perma.cc</a> web archiving tool used by courts, law journals, and law firms; the <a href="https://case.law/">Caselaw Access Project</a>, sharing all precedential cases of the United States; and our research on <a href="https://lil.law.harvard.edu/century-scale-storage/">Century Scale Storage</a>. This work is made possible with support from the Filecoin Foundation for the Decentralized Web and the Rockefeller Brothers Fund.</p>
