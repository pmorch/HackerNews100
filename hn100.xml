            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/28/24166177/google-search-ranking-algorithm-leak-documents-link-seo">https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/28/24166177/google-search-ranking-algorithm-leak-documents-link-seo</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40505310">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Google’s search algorithm is perhaps the most consequential system on the internet, dictating <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/2/24147152/google-search-seo-publishing-housefresh-product-reviews">what sites live and die</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/c/23998379/google-search-seo-algorithm-webpage-optimization">what content on the web looks like</a>. But how exactly Google ranks websites has long been a mystery, pieced together by journalists, researchers, and people working in search engine optimization.</p><p>Now, an explosive leak that purports to show <a href="https://sparktoro.com/blog/an-anonymous-source-shared-thousands-of-leaked-google-search-api-documents-with-me-everyone-in-seo-should-see-them/">thousands of pages of internal documents</a> appears to offer an unprecedented look under the hood of how Search works — and suggests that Google hasn’t been entirely truthful about it for years. So far, Google hasn’t responded to multiple requests for comment on the legitimacy of the documents.</p><p>Rand Fishkin, who worked in SEO for more than a decade, says a source shared 2,500 pages of documents with him with the hopes that reporting on the leak would counter the “lies” that Google employees had shared about how the search algorithm works. The documents outline Google’s search API and break down what information is available to employees, according to Fishkin.</p><p>The details shared by Fishkin are dense and technical, likely more legible to developers and SEO experts than the layperson. The contents of the leak are also not necessarily proof that Google uses the specific data and signals it mentions for search rankings. Rather, the leak outlines what data Google collects from webpages, sites, and searchers and offers indirect hints to SEO experts about what Google seems to care about, as SEO expert Mike King <a href="https://ipullrank.com/google-algo-leak">wrote</a> in his overview of the documents.</p><p>The leaked documents touch on topics like what kind of data Google collects and uses, which sites Google elevates for sensitive topics like elections, how Google handles small websites, and more. Some information in the documents appears to be in conflict with public statements by Google representatives, according to Fishkin and King. </p><p>“‘Lied’ is harsh, but it’s the only accurate word to use here,” King writes. “While I don’t necessarily fault Google’s public representatives for protecting their proprietary information, I do take issue with their efforts to actively discredit people in the marketing, tech, and journalism worlds who have presented reproducible discoveries.”</p><p>Google has not responded to <em>The Verge’</em>s requests for comment<em> </em>regarding the documents, including a direct request to refute their legitimacy. Fishkin told <em>The Verge </em>in an email that the company has not disputed the veracity of the leak, but that an employee asked him to change some language in the post regarding how an event was characterized.</p><p>Google’s secretive search algorithm has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/features/23931789/seo-search-engine-optimization-experts-google-results">birthed an entire industry</a> of marketers who closely follow Google’s public guidance and execute it for millions of companies around the world. The pervasive, often annoying tactics have led to a general narrative that Google Search results are getting worse, crowded with junk that website operators <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23753963/google-seo-shopify-small-business-ai">feel required to produce</a> to have their sites seen. In response to <em>The Verge</em>’s past reporting on the SEO-driven tactics, Google representatives often fall back to a familiar defense: that’s not what the <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/fundamentals/seo-starter-guide">Google guidelines</a> say. </p><p>But some details in the leaked documents call into question the accuracy of Google’s public statements regarding how Search works. </p><p>One example cited by Fishkin and King is whether Google Chrome data is used in ranking at all. Google representatives have <a href="https://www.seroundtable.com/google-chrome-search-usage-15618.html">repeatedly</a> <a href="https://iloveseo.com/seo/google-does-not-use-anything-from-google-chrome-for-ranking/">indicated</a> that it doesn’t use Chrome data to rank pages, but Chrome is <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/google_api_content_warehouse/0.4.0/GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.QualitySitemapTargetGroup.html#module-attributes">specifically mentioned in sections</a> about how websites appear in Search. In the screenshot below, which I captured as an example, the links appearing below the main vogue.com URL may be created in part using Chrome data, according to the documents.</p><div><div role="button" aria-label="Zoom" tabindex="0"><figure><div><p><span><img alt="A Google Search screenshot of the Vogue.com result, with sublinks below the main homepage.

E-E-A-T stands for experience, expertise, authoritativeness, and trustworthiness, <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2022/12/google-raters-guidelines-e-e-a-t">a Google metric used to evaluate the quality of results</a>. Google representatives have <a href="https://x.com/searchliaison/status/1755283334631231514">previously said E-E-A-T isn’t a ranking factor</a>. Fishkin notes that he hasn’t found much in the documents mentioning E-E-A-T by name.</p></div><p>King, however, detailed how Google appears to collect author data from a page and has a field for whether an entity on the page is the author. A portion of the documents shared by King reads that the field was “mainly developed and tuned for news articles... but is also populated for other content (e.g., scientific articles).” Though this doesn’t confirm that bylines are an explicit ranking metric, it does show that Google is at least keeping track of this attribute. Google representatives have <a href="https://x.com/searchliaison/status/1744379351297081637">previously insisted</a> that author bylines are something website owners should do for readers, not Google, because it doesn’t impact rankings.</p><p>Though the documents aren’t exactly a smoking gun, they provide a deep, unfiltered look at a tightly guarded black box system. The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23869483/us-v-google-search-antitrust-case-updates">US government’s antitrust case against Google</a> — which revolves around Search — has also led to internal documentation becoming public, offering further insights into how the company’s main product works. </p><p>Google’s general caginess on how Search works has led to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/c/23998379/google-search-seo-algorithm-webpage-optimization">websites looking the same</a> as SEO marketers try to outsmart Google based on hints the company offers. Fishkin also calls out the publications credulously propping up Google’s public claims as truth without much further analysis.</p><p>“Historically, some of the search industry’s loudest voices and most prolific publishers have been happy to uncritically repeat Google’s public statements. They write headlines like ‘Google says XYZ is true,’ rather than ‘Google Claims XYZ; Evidence Suggests Otherwise,’” Fishkin writes. “Please, do better. If this leak and the DOJ trial can create just one change, I hope this is it.”</p></div></div>]]></description>

And then GPT4o came out, reclaiming the throne with its multimodal finesse. Today, we’re releasing something to change that: Llama3-V, the first-ever multimodal model built on top of Llama3. As a bonus, we train everything in under $500.</p><p id="9c85">How are the benchmarks you ask? We’ll let the tables speak for themselves. We have a 10–20% boost over Llava, the current SOTA and most popular model for multimodal understanding. Additionally, we fair very comparably to the closed source models of 100x the size on all metrics except MMMU.</p><figure></figure><h2 id="b6f7"><strong>Check us out on:</strong></h2><p id="9871">• 🤗: <a href="https://huggingface.co/mustafaaljadery/llama3v/tree/main" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">https://huggingface.co/mustafaaljadery/llama3v/</a></p><p id="9c17">• Github: <a href="https://github.com/mustafaaljadery/llama3v" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/mustafaaljadery/llama3v</a></p><h2 id="7795">The rest of the article covers</h2><ul><li id="ce14">Model Architecture</li><li id="422f">Training Framework</li><li id="ca98">Systems Optimizations</li><li id="68e8">Summary</li></ul><h2 id="5f28"><strong>Model Architecture</strong></h2><p id="2a6d">The bulk of our engineering efforts go into making Llama3 understand visual information. To do so, we take an input image and embed it into a series of patch embeddings using the SigLIP model. These embeddings are then aligned with the textual tokens via a projection block, which applies two self-attention blocks to put the textual and visual embeddings in the same plane. Finally, the visual tokens from the projection block are prepended to the textual tokens and the joint representation is passed into Llama3, just as it normally would.</p><figure><figcaption>Llama3-V Architecture: We use SigLIP to embed our input image in patches. Then we train a projection block with two self-attention blocks to align our textual and visual tokens.</figcaption></figure><p id="93cc">The diagram above illustrates at a high-level how everything works. Now, let’s dive into each stage in detail.</p><p id="66fa"><strong>SigLIP</strong>: SigLIP (Sigmoid Loss for Language Image Pre-Training) is an image embedding model that is similar to CLIP as we see in the figure below. However, unlike CLIP which uses a contrastive loss with softmax normalization, SigLIP utilizes a pairwise sigmoid loss, which allows the model to operate independently on each image-text pair, without requiring a global view across all pairs in a batch. At a high-level, SigLIP’s vision encoder splits the image into a sequence of non-overlapping image patches and projects them into a lower-dimensional linear embedding space, producing a sequence of patch embeddings. These patch embeddings then go through a vision encoder, which applies self-attention to capture long-range dependencies and extract higher-level visual features. For our purposes, we directly use the original SigLIP model trained by Google DeepMind.</p><figure><figcaption>Illustration of how SigLIP embeddings work. We train an image and text decoder concurrently but in our case the text encoding module is kept fixed. Unlike CLIP, we minimize a sigmoid loss instead of a softmax loss but most other things stay the same. Image from <a href="https://x.com/mervenoyann/status/1745476609686089800/photo/1" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">twitter post </a>by Merve</figcaption></figure><p id="a1f8"><strong>Alignment with textual embeddings: </strong>To save computational resources, we keep SigLIP fixed. However, to align the output image embeddings with the textual embeddings used in Llama3, we use an extra projection module. Unlike Llava, which applies a single linear layer to the original image embeddings, we instead train two self-attention blocks to better capture patterns in the input embeddings, producing the final image embedding vector.</p><p id="fcd5"><strong>Prepending image tokens:</strong> For the textual inputs, we first tokenize the text using a Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) vocabulary, producing a sequence of textual tokens. We demarcate these tokens by enclosing them within special &lt;text&gt; and &lt;/text&gt; tags. As for the image embeddings from the projection block, we treat each vector as a separate “visual token” and demarcate them using &lt;image&gt; and &lt;/image&gt; tags. Finally, we prepend the sequence of visual tokens to the sequence of textual tokens, forming the joint input representation that is passed into Llama3 for processing.</p><h2 id="75f6">Inference Optimizations</h2><p id="a1bb">Training these models is expensive. To optimize for computation resources, we make two major optimizations. The first is a simple caching mechanism and the second is on the MPS/MLX front.</p><p id="a391"><strong>Caching: </strong>The SigLIP model is much smaller than Llama3. Therefore, if we run everything serially, we have very little GPU utilization when SigLIP is running. Moreover, we can’t push the utilization up by increasing the batch size up on SigLIP as then Llama runs into OOM errors. Instead we observed that our SigLIP model stays the same and instead pre-compute the image embeddings. Then, for both pre-training and SFT, we directly pass in these precomputed image embeddings instead of re-running the SigLIP module. Not only does this allow us to increase the batch size and maximally use our GPUs for running the SigLIP modules, it also saves us training/inference time as the two parts of the pipeline can occur separately.</p><p id="df3e"><strong>MPS/MLX Optimizations: </strong>Our second optimization was again driven by SigLIP’s smaller size relative to Llama. Specifically, since SigLIP fit on our Macbooks, we ran inference on an MPS optimized SigLIP model, which allowed us to attain a throughput of 32 images/second — allowing our caching step happen relatively quickly.</p><h2 id="8756"><strong>How it was trained</strong></h2><p id="0e19"><strong>Precompute the embeddings from SigLIP: </strong>let’s now dive into the first step of our pre-training process: <em>precomputing the image embeddings via SigLIP</em>. In this step, our goal is to essentially pass in images into the SigLIP embedding model to obtain a vector representation or embedding of the image. One technical detail: due to higher resolutions, we follow the approach taken by LLaVA-UHD and perform image-splitting. The purpose of image-splitting is to divide the image into variable-sized patches or segments for more efficient encoding. These split images are processed concurrently in batches.</p><p id="b746">Now let’s dive into how exactly we use the SigLIP embedding. We first load the SigLIP model and processor/tokenizer. We then preprocess the provided input image using the processor. We then pass the preprocessed image to the model. Following this, the model outputs logits for the image-text pairs. We now proceed to apply the sigmoid activation function to the logits to get the probabilities. We now see that the image embedding is contained within these probabilities. So far this embedding captures the visual information in the image.</p><p id="7ba6">Following the computation of the image embedding via SigLIP, we now proceed to learn a projection matrix — you can also think of this as the <em>projection layer</em>, which is typically a linear or feed-forward layer. As described above in the ingredients section, the projection layer maps the vision embedding from its original space into a joint multimodal embedding space. Specifically, the projection layer applies a learned weight matrix W_v to the vision embedding v to get the projected multimodal vision embedding W_v * v. So after this projection step, the vision and text embeddings are essentially aligned into a common multimodal embedding space, allowing their representations to interact and be combined for multimodal modeling tasks like visual question answering, image captioning, etc. More specifically, the result of the projection layer is the generated “latents.”</p><p id="07a9">Once the latents are computed, we then prepend them as image tokens before the text tokens. The reason for the prepending is that having the image before the text makes it easier for the model to learn during pretraining. Think of it as having tokens representing the actual image and then tokens representing the contents of the image in text: almost like a caption paired with an image. Our architecture is nearly identical to that of LLaVA-UHD (they choose CLIP-ViT while we use SigLIP and they work with Vicuna-13B) so we provide their illustration as reference below:</p><figure></figure><p id="8bdb">Now that we’ve established the data needed for pretraining, we can dive into what that actually looks like. In pre-training, we then use 600,000 examples of prepended images to text. In this step we keep the main weights of the Llama-3 architecture frozen. The key is that we want to only update the gradients of the projection matrix. Crucially, we keep the rest of the weights frozen. And with that, we’ve wrapped up our intuition and process for the pretraining step. The key here was aligning the embedded images (latents) with their text in a joint representation and then pretraining LLaMA-3 to focus on updating the projection matrix based on the examples encountered.</p><p id="7888"><strong>Supervised Finetuning</strong></p><p id="f3f5">Following pretraining, we perform supervised finetuning to enhance the performance of our model. In this step, we are freezing our computed embeddings (from the projection layer) and we keep everything except the vision and projection matrices frozen. In other words, if you look at the image below, the red components are unfrozen while the blue components are frozen. This is meant to serve as “instruction” finetuning — in other words making the model stronger for a multimodal text output. In this stage, we use 1M examples (7M split images).</p><figure></figure><h2 id="f170"><strong>In Summary</strong></h2><ul><li id="4f32">We add a vision encoder to Llama3 8B</li><li id="0665">Our model offers 10–20% performance boosts over Llava the current open-source SOTA vision language model.</li><li id="6423">We offer comparable vision abilities of models close to 100x* larger in size like GPT4v, Gemini Ultra, and Claude Opus.</li><li id="792d">We describe an efficient pipeline to pretrain and instruction finetune the model in under $500.</li></ul></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        When an user directs their web browser to an HTTP URL, it's a common practice for the service to redirect the
        request to a corresponding HTTPS page. This unencrypted part of the communication flow has its flaws. Third
        parties in shared networks, as well as network intermediaries, could
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sniffing_attack" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sniff</a>
        passwords and other secrets from the initial HTTP traffic
        or even impersonate the web server with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MITM</a> attack.
        Nevertheless, redirection has been an useful first step in the transition from the largely unencrypted early web
        to the <a href="https://transparencyreport.google.com/https/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">largely encrypted</a> web of today.
      </p>
      <p>
        Later techniques tightened the security story further. Servers can now send <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HSTS</a> along with the initial HTTP-to-HTTPS redirection response, telling the
        user's browser to use only HTTPS for that domain from
        then on. This limits the window of opportunity for trivial sniffing and MITM attacks to the first request.
        Browsers then added <a href="https://hstspreload.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HSTS preload
          lists</a> and <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/https-only-prefs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HTTPS-Only modes</a> that allow skipping the initial unencrypted request altogether.
      </p>
      <p>
        From the perspective of usability-security tradeoff it all makes sense for user-facing sites. But interestingly,
        the redirection approach also appears to be widely adopted for APIs. APIs are mostly consumed by other software
        so the same usability arguments don't apply there. Moreover, many programmatic API clients don't tend to keep
        browser-like state of things like HSTS headers they have seen.
      </p>
      <p>
        This post argues that, due to these factors, the common practice of redirecting API calls from HTTP to
        HTTPS should be reconsidered. While the post mostly refers to REST APIs, its points also apply to other styles
        of APIs that use HTTP(S) as a transport mechanism.
      </p>

      <h2>A Simple Typo Is Enugh</h2>
      <p>
        At <a href="https://badrap.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">work</a>, we were building a new
        integration against a third-party API. The initial code commit contained a mistyped API base URL
        <code>"http://..."</code> instead of <code>"https://..."</code>. A pretty easy mistake to make.
      </p>
      <p>
        The error was essentially masked during runtime: The third-party API responded to every request with a 301
        redirect to their HTTPS side. Node.js's built-in <a href="https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/globals.html#fetch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fetch</a>
        happily and <em>quietly</em> followed those redirects to the HTTPS endpoint.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Every single one of our API requests now sent the API keys over the network in plaintext</strong>,
        before then sending them again to the encrypted endpoint. The one letter omission could have exposed the used
        API keys to third parties without us realizing it. As the integration would have worked, there's a good
        chance that code would have leaked any secrets in the API calls for years. In the long run, the
        probabilities for malice tend to accumulate.
      </p>
      <p>
        Luckily we spotted the error during the code review before the error could propagate to production or even
        testing. We also realized that our <em>own</em> API also did similar HTTP-to-HTTPS redirects.
      </p>

      <h2>The Fail-fast Principle</h2>
      <p>
        When an API redirect HTTP requests to HTTPS - and the API client silently follows those redirects - it tends to
        hide mistyped URLs like in the case described above. A simple one-letter omission can easily be ignored, end up
        in production, and compromise the entire system's confidentiality.
      </p>
      <p>
        In most cases, it's better to adhere to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fail-fast_system" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fail-fast principle</a>: unencrypted API calls should fail in a
        spectacular and visible way so that the developer can easily spot and fix the typo as early as possible during
        the development process.
      </p>
      <p>
        A great solution for failing fast would be to disable the API server's HTTP interface altogether and not even
        answer to connections attempts to port 80. If the initial unencrypted connection is never established then the
        API keys aren't sent, mitigating sniffing attacks and limiting the window of opportunity for MITM attacks to an
        extremely small time window. This approach is viable for APIs hosted under their own domains like
        <code>api.example.com</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our own API was served under the <code>/api</code> path from the same domain as our service's web UI. We
        didn't have the guts to disable the HTTP interface for that domain altogether, so we picked next best
        option: all unencrypted HTTP requests made under <code>/api</code> now return a descriptive error message along
        with the HTTP status code 403. Some initial plaintext requests might be made during development, but they're
        much easier for developers to notice.
      </p>

      <h2>Who Else?</h2>
      <p>
        That took care of our own API. We also pinged the third-party API provider and a couple of friends that they
        might want to check their APIs. And who knows, maybe there were some commonly used APIs that accept API keys (or
        other credentials) and also redirect from HTTP to HTTPS?
      </p>
      <p>
        I listed a bunch of well known APIs from the top of my head and did a little surveys. Several of them returned
        HTTP errors or declined to connections altogether. They're listed here with cURL spells for checking out their
        detailed responses:

      <p>
        I didn't report these findings separately to all of these API providers. There were some outliers not listed
        here that I did contact, with varying results. More on that later.
      </p>
      <p>
        Take each individual result with a grain of salt: I had to test some of these APIs without valid
        credentials, or with credentials used in documentation examples. But the overall pattern indicates that the
        habit of APIs redirecting HTTP requests to HTTPS is quite widespread. Why is that?
      </p>

      <h2>Best Practices Need Practice Too</h2>
      <p>
        When speaking with people about this topic, many have noted that HTTP-to-HTTPS redirects from APIs have obvious
        downsides - in hindsight.
      </p>
      <p>Redirects for user-facing applications are often mentioned in lists best practices and cheat sheets, <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Transport_Layer_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html#use-tls-for-all-pages" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">like the ones published by OWASP (The Open Worldwide Application
          Security Project)</a>.
        Recommendations specifically aimed for APIs seem rare in contrast. I found just few mentions, for example an
        excellent PDF slideset called <a href="https://owasp.org/www-chapter-belgium/assets/2018/2018-10-23/OWASP_20181023_CommonAPISecurityPitfalls.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">"Common API Security Pitfalls"</a> by <a href="https://infosec.exchange/@PhilippeDeRyck" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Philippe De
          Ryck</a>,
        buried deep within the OWASP website:
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img alt="Slide 8 of &quot;Common API Security Pitfalls&quot;: &quot;API-only endpoints should disable HTTP and only need to support HTTPS.&quot;" src="https://jviide.iki.fi/deryck-slide-8.png">

            section.
          </small>
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        My Google-fu might just be bad. But maybe each best practice item recommending HTTP-to-HTTPS redirects
        for user-facing sites should have an explicit caveat attached, prominently advising against such redirects for
        APIs. Therefore I opened <a href="https://github.com/OWASP/CheatSheetSeries/issues/1407" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">an issue</a> that suggests amending OWASP's Transport Layer Security Cheat Sheet
        accordingly.
      </p>

      <h2>Bonus Round: Popular APIs That Respond In Plaintext</h2>
      <p>
        While reviewing the list of APIs, I bumped into some popular ones that neither redirected nor failed
        unencrypted requests. They just responded to unencrypted HTTP requests with unencrypted HTTP responses, without
        enforcing HTTPS at any stage.
      </p>
      <p>
        Maybe they had their reasons, or maybe they had just accidentally misconfigured their reverse proxies.
        Regardless, seeing that they all handle potentially sensitive data, I contacted these API providers through
        their respective security channels and explained the problem. The providers are listed below in the order of
        reporting. I'll unredact their names and details when they've given a definite response, or otherwise after
        a reasonable amount of time has passed.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Provider A</strong>: Reported on <time datetime="2024-05-17">2024-05-17</time> through their
          vulnerability reporting email address. Awaiting response.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Provider B</strong>: Reported on <time datetime="2024-05-21">2024-05-21</time> through their HackerOne
          program. Got a prompt triage response, stating that attacks requiring MITM (or physical access to a user's
          device) are outside the scope of the program. Sent back a response explaining that MITM or physical access was
          not required for sniffing. Awaiting response.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Provider C</strong>: Reported on <time datetime="2024-05-21">2024-05-21</time> through their security
          email address. Awaiting response.
        </li>
        <li id="virustotal">
          <a href="https://docs.virustotal.com/reference/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VirusTotal
            API</a>: Reported on <time datetime="2024-05-21">2024-05-21</time> through Google's <a href="https://bughunters.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bug Hunters</a> site
          (VirusTotal is owned by a Google subsidiary that got merged into Google Cloud). The
          API responds in plaintext to requests like for example this (where <code>$API_KEY</code> is a valid API key):

          <p>
            <code>curl -i -H 'x-apikey: $API_KEY' http://www.virustotal.com/api/v3/ip_addresses/1.1.1.1</code>
          </p>

          <p>
            The report got promptly triaged. Received a response on <time datetime="2024-05-24">2024-05-24</time>, cited
            in part below:
          </p>

          
          
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        Redirecting HTTP to HTTPS for APIs can be more harmful than helpful due to the nature of APIs. Unlike
        user-facing web pages, APIs are primarily consumed by other software. API clients often follow redirects
        automatically and do not maintain state or support security headers like HSTS. This can lead to silent failures
        where sensitive data in each API request is initially transmitted in plaintext over the network, unencrypted.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's adopt a fail-fast approach and disable the HTTP interface entirely or return clear
        error responses for unencrypted requests. This ensures that developers can quickly notice and fix accidental
        use <code>http://</code> URLs to <code>https://</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Several well-known and popular APIs also redirect HTTP requests to HTTPS. This behavior seems to be
        widespread. Maybe it's time we amend best practices to explicitly recommend that APIs flat our reject
        unencrypted requests.

He generated a password using the RoboForm password manager and stored that password in a file encrypted with a tool called TrueCrypt. At some point, that file got corrupted and Michael lost access to the 20-character password he had generated to secure his 43.6 BTC (worth a total of about €4,000, or $5,300, in 2013). Michael used the RoboForm password manager to generate the password but did not store it in his manager. He worried that someone would hack his computer and obtain the password.</p><p>“At [that] time, I was really paranoid with my security,” he laughs.</p><p>Grand is a famed hardware hacker who in 2022 helped another crypto wallet owner <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/24/22898712/crypto-hardware-wallet-hacking-lost-bitcoin-ethereum-nft">recover access to $2 million in cryptocurrency</a> he thought he’d lost forever after forgetting the PIN to his Trezor wallet. Since then, dozens of people have contacted Grand to help them recover their treasure. But Grand, known by the hacker handle “Kingpin,” turns down most of them, for various reasons.</p><p>Grand is an <a data-offer-url="http://www.grandideastudio.com/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;http://www.grandideastudio.com/&quot;}" href="http://www.grandideastudio.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">electrical engineer</a> who began hacking computing hardware at age 10 and in 2008 cohosted the Discovery Channel’s <em>Prototype This</em> show.

He cracked the Trezor wallet in 2022 using complex hardware techniques that forced the USB-style wallet to reveal its password.</p><figure data-testid="IframeEmbed"><div data-testid="IframeEmbedContainer"><p><iframe height="300px" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-popups allow-same-origin" title="Embedded Frame" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/o5IySpAkThg" allow="autoplay *; encrypted-media *; clipboard-write; autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture"></iframe></p></div></figure><p>But Michael stored his cryptocurrency in a software-based wallet, which meant none of Grand’s hardware skills were relevant this time. He considered brute-forcing Michael’s password—writing a script to automatically guess millions of possible passwords to find the correct one—but determined this wasn’t feasible. He briefly considered that the RoboForm password manager Michael used to generate his password might have a flaw in the way it generated passwords, which would allow him to guess the password more easily. Grand, however, doubted such a flaw existed.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Michael contacted multiple people who specialize in cracking cryptography; they all told him “there’s no chance” of retrieving his money. But last June he approached Grand again, hoping to convince him to help, and this time Grand agreed to give it a try, working with a friend named Bruno in Germany who also hacks digital wallets.</p><p>Grand and Bruno spent months reverse engineering the version of the RoboForm program that they thought Michael had used in 2013 and found that the pseudo-random number generator used to generate passwords in that version—and subsequent versions until 2015—did indeed have a significant flaw that made the random number generator not so random. The RoboForm program unwisely tied the random passwords it generated to the date and time on the user’s computer—it determined the computer’s date and time, and then generated passwords that were predictable. If you knew the date and time and other parameters, you could compute any password that would have been generated on a certain date and time in the past.</p><p>If Michael knew the day or general time frame in 2013 when he generated it, as well as the parameters he used to generate the password (for example, the number of characters in the password, including lower- and upper-case letters, figures, and special characters), this would narrow the possible password guesses to a manageable number. Then they could hijack the RoboForm function responsible for checking the date and time on a computer and get it to travel back in time, believing the current date was a day in the 2013 time frame when Michael generated his password. RoboForm would then spit out the same passwords it generated on the days in 2013.</p><p>There was one problem: Michael couldn’t remember when he created the password.</p><p>According to the log on his software wallet, Michael moved bitcoin into his wallet for the first time on April 14, 2013. But he couldn’t remember if he generated the password the same day or some time before or after this. So, looking at the parameters of other passwords he generated using RoboForm, Grand and Bruno configured RoboForm to generate 20-character passwords with upper- and lower-case letters, numbers, and eight special characters from March 1 to April 20, 2013.</p><p>It failed to generate the right password. So Grand and Bruno lengthened the time frame from April 20 to June 1, 2013, using the same parameters. Still no luck.</p><p>Michael says they kept coming back to him, asking if he was sure about the parameters he’d used. He stuck to his first answer.</p><p>“They really annoyed me, because who knows what I did 10 years ago,” he recalls. He found other passwords he generated with RoboForm in 2013, and two of them did not use special characters, so Grand and Bruno adjusted. Last November, they reached out to Michael to set up a meeting in person. “I thought, ‘Oh my God, they will ask me again for the settings.”</p><p>Instead, they revealed that they had finally found the correct password—no special characters. It was generated on May 15, 2013, at 4:10:40 pm GMT.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>“We ultimately got lucky that our parameters and time range was right. If either of those were wrong, we would have … continued to take guesses/shots in the dark,” Grand says in an email to WIRED. “It would have taken significantly longer to precompute all the possible passwords.”</p><p>Grand and Bruno <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5IySpAkThg">created a video</a> to explain the technical details more thoroughly.</p><p>RoboForm, made by US-based Siber Systems, was one of the first password managers on the market, and <a data-offer-url="https://earthweb.com/roboform-users/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://earthweb.com/roboform-users/&quot;}" href="https://earthweb.com/roboform-users/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">currently has more than 6 million users</a> worldwide, according to a company report. In 2015, Siber seemed to fix the RoboForm password manager. In a cursory glance, Grand and Bruno couldn’t find any sign that the pseudo-random number generator in the 2015 version used the computer’s time, which makes them think they removed it to fix the flaw, though Grand says they would need to examine it more thoroughly to be certain.</p><p>Siber Systems confirmed to WIRED that it did fix the issue with version 7.9.14 of RoboForm, released June 10, 2015, but a spokesperson wouldn’t answer questions about how it did so. In a <a data-offer-url="https://www.roboform.com/news-windows" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.roboform.com/news-windows&quot;}" href="https://www.roboform.com/news-windows" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">changelog</a> on the company’s website, it mentions only that Siber programmers made changes to&nbsp;“increase randomness of generated passwords,” but it doesn’t say how they did this. Siber spokesman Simon Davis says that “RoboForm 7 was discontinued in 2017.”</p><p>Grand says that, without knowing how Siber fixed the issue, attackers may still be able to regenerate passwords generated by versions of RoboForm released before the fix in 2015. He’s also not sure if current versions contain the problem.</p><p>“I'm still not sure I would trust it without knowing how they actually improved the password generation in more recent versions,” he says. “I'm not sure if RoboForm knew how bad this particular weakness was.”</p><p>Customers may also still be using passwords that were generated with the early versions of the program before the fix. It doesn’t appear that Siber ever notified customers when it released the fixed version 7.9.14 in 2015 that they should generate new passwords for critical accounts or data. The company didn’t respond to a question about this.</p><p>If Siber didn’t inform customers, this would mean that anyone like Michael who used RoboForm to generate passwords prior to 2015—and are still using those passwords—may have vulnerable passwords that hackers can regenerate.</p><p>“We know that most people don't change passwords unless they're prompted to do so,” Grand says. “Out of 935 passwords in my password manager (not RoboForm), 220 of them are from 2015 and earlier, and most of them are [for] sites I still use.”</p><p>Depending on what the company did to fix the issue in 2015, newer passwords may also be vulnerable.</p><p>Last November, Grand and Bruno deducted a percentage of bitcoins from Michael’s account for the work they did, then gave him the password to access the rest. The bitcoin was worth $38,000 per coin at the time. Michael waited until it rose to $62,000 per coin and sold some of it. He now has 30 BTC, now worth $3 million, and is waiting for the value to rise to $100,000 per coin.</p><p>Michael says he was lucky that he lost the password years ago because, otherwise, he would have sold off the bitcoin when it was worth $40,000 a coin and missed out on a greater fortune.</p><p>“That I lost the password was financially a good thing.”</p></div></div></div>]]></description>

                                        <p>TOKYO (AP) — The operator of Japan’s destroyed Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant demonstrated Tuesday how a remote-controlled robot would retrieve tiny bits of melted fuel debris from one of three damaged reactors later this year for the first time since the <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/japan-fukushima-quake-tsunami-anniversary-0089f053d670c78dafd9578c242e1fb3">2011 meltdown</a></span>.</p><p>Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings plans to deploy a “telesco-style” extendable pipe robot into Fukushima Daiichi No. 2 reactor to test the removal of debris from its primary containment vessel by October.</p><p>That work is more than two years behind schedule. The removal of melted fuel was supposed to begin in late 2021 but has been plagued with delays, underscoring the difficulty of recovering from the magnitude 9.0 quake and tsunami in 2011.</p><p>During the demonstration at the Mitsubishi Heavy Industries’ shipyard in Kobe, western Japan, where the robot has been developed, a device equipped with tongs slowly descended from the telescopic pipe to a heap of gravel and picked up a granule.</p>
    

<p>TEPCO plans to remove less than 3 grams (0.1 ounce) of debris in the test at the Fukushima plant.</p><p>“We believe the upcoming test removal of fuel debris from Unit 2 is an extremely important step to steadily carry out future decommissioning work,” said Yusuke Nakagawa, a TEPCO group manager for the fuel debris retrieval program. “It is important to proceed with the test removal safely and steadily.”</p>



<p>About 880 tons of highly radioactive melted nuclear fuel remain inside the three damaged reactors. Critics say the 30- to 40-year cleanup target set by the government and TEPCO for Fukushima Daiichi is overly optimistic. The damage in each reactor is different, and plans must accommodate their conditions.</p>
    
<p>Better understanding the melted fuel debris from inside the reactors is key to their decommissioning. TEPCO deployed four mini drones into the No. 1 reactor’s primary containment vessel earlier this year to capture images from the areas where robots had not reached.</p><h2>___</h2><p>AP video journalist Ayaka McGill contributed to this report.</p>

<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="docker pull openkoda/openkoda:latest"><pre><code>docker pull openkoda/openkoda:latest

<p dir="auto">Please note that in that case Postgres needs to be already in place and <code>SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL</code>, <code>SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME</code>, <code>SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD</code> env variables needs to be adjusted when running docker (<a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/openkoda/openkoda" rel="nofollow">see Docker Hub for detailed options</a>)</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="incArticle"><p>OpenAI's credibility — and the credibility of its CEO, Sam Altman — is crumbling.</p><p>Last week, amid a surprise string of high-profile executive and safety team departures, <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2024/5/17/24158478/openai-departures-sam-altman-employees-chatgpt-release"><em>V</em><em>ox</em> revealed that</a> the ChatGPT creator had pressured employees into signing draconian non-disclosure and non-disparagement agreements by threatening to claw back exiting OpenAI employees' vested equity in the multibillion-dollar AI company.</p><p>Clawing back vested equity — in short, the amount of company ownership that an employee has gained through their months or years of working there — is a highly unusual practice to begin with. This is especially true in the startup-powered Silicon Valley, where tech workers often forgo high salaries in favor of equity agreements based on the hope that they'll get rich later when a successful startup like OpenAI eventually goes public. For OpenAI to play bizarre contractual take-backsies in exchange for narrative control over former employees would be an <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/openai-nda-criticism">awful look</a> for any company — let alone a supposedly "open" venture claiming it's the best one to build the imagined all-knowing AI that OpenAI's leaders say will power humanity's future.</p><p>In response to the <em>Vox</em> report, Altman apologetically took to X-formerly-Twitter to admit that yes, "there was a provision about potential equity cancellation in our previous exit docs." But according to the CEO, though the clause was there, the company never <em>actually&nbsp;</em>clawed anything back. Most importantly, he further <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/sam-altman-nda-superintelligent">claimed</a> that he had no knowledge of the provision.</p><p>"This is on me and one of the few times I've been genuinely embarrassed running OpenAI," Altman continued in a tone that can only be described as sheepish, "I did not know this was happening and I should have."</p><p>But <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/351132/openai-vested-equity-nda-sam-altman-documents-employees">according to <em>Vox's</em> latest follow-up</a>, Altman wasn't in the dark about the equity clauses, as he claimed in his tail-between-legs tweet.</p><p>Documentation reviewed by <em>Vox</em> reveals that several company leaders — including OpenAI chief strategy officer Jason Kwon, who reportedly told staffers following the initial <em>Vox </em>report that OpenAI leadership "caught" the provision "~month ago" — signed documents that plainly outlined the stifling clawback provision. The list of executives includes Altman, whose signature, according to <em>Vox</em>'s reporting, is on "incorporation documents" for the holding company that manages OpenAI equity; these documents contain "multiple passages with language that gives the company near-arbitrary authority to claw back equity from former employees" or, if employees choose not to actually return the equity, "block them from selling it" altogether.</p><p>In other words, unless someone forged the CEO's signature, he gave express permission for these clauses to exist. Outside of forgery, there are only two plausible reasons for Altman's alleged lack of knowledge: either he didn't fully read the employment contracts he was signing or he was lying.</p><p>Complicating the denials further is the way employees were reportedly treated on their way out. According to the <em>Vox</em> report, the equity provisions were no secret to OpenAI representatives handling departures, who in some cases gave outgoing employees just seven days to make the incredibly complicated decision about their future — all the while, in instances reviewed by <em>Vox</em>, emphasizing possible clawbacks.</p><p>"We want to make sure you understand that if you don't sign, it could impact your equity," one rep told an outgoing employee, according to <em>Vox</em>. "That's true for everyone, and we're just doing things by the book."</p><p>But again, as the report reiterates, this is <em>not </em>"by-the-book" behavior.</p><p>"For a company to threaten to claw back already-vested equity is egregious and unusual," Chambord Benton-Hayes, a California employment law attorney, told <em>Vox.</em></p><p>When <em>Vox</em> asked OpenAI to explain how the provisions could have possibly wound up in documents signed by Altman without Altman actually knowing about them, Kwon non-answered that "we are sorry for the distress this has caused great people who have worked hard for us."</p><p>"We have been working to fix this as quickly as possible," Kwon — who, again, also signed papers delineating this provision — continued in his statement. "We will work even harder to be better."</p><p>But that's getting harder and harder to believe. Last year, when Altman was briefly forced out of OpenAI in what was pretty much a corporate coup, those who voted to oust the CEO — many of whom departed after losing said coup — claimed that Altman had been "inconsistently candid" in his communications with the board. Altman and OpenAI are also caught up in a <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/law-experts-scarlett-johansson-strong-case-openai">brewing legal storm</a> with actress Scarlett Johansson, who claims that Altman copycatted her voice for OpenAI's new "Sky" AI assistant after she had explicitly turned Altman and OpenAI down. (Altman chalked Johansson's allegations up to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/openai-scarlett-johansson-voice-defense-sam-altman-washington-post-chatgpt-2024-5">simple miscommunication</a>.)</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://futurism.com/openai-safety-worker-quit-confidence-agi">recent departures</a> have <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/openai-researcher-quits-criticism-superallignment">ground</a> OpenAI's "Superalignment" safety team — the ones tasked with making sure a killer AI doesn't obliterate humankind — <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/17/openai-superalignment-sutskever-leike.html">into dust</a>. Great stuff.</p><p>On its website, OpenAI features a "<a href="https://openai.com/charter/">charter</a>" declaring that "OpenAI's mission is to ensure that artificial general intelligence (AGI) — by which we mean highly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work — benefits all of humanity."</p><p>"We will attempt to directly build safe and beneficial AGI," it continues, "but will also consider our mission fulfilled if our work aids others to achieve this outcome."</p><p>The document then lists a series of "principles," which the company claims it'll follow to achieve this mission. The word "transparency" is notably absent.</p><p><strong>More on OpenAI: </strong><a href="https://futurism.com/sam-altman-openai-scarlett-johansson"><em>Sam Altman Ignoring Scarlett Johansson's Lack of Consent Shows Us Exactly What Type of Person He Really Is</em></a></p><br></section></div>]]></description>

    <p>Have you ever wondered what it would be like to engage in a mobile ecosystem
outside of the watchful eye of the Big Tech giants and gatekeepers? A system
that includes everything from operating systems, to app stores, to cloud
services, messaging apps, email servers and more? A system that puts your
privacy first, believes in a democratic approach and healthy competition,
and a system that relies on open-source solutions to drive its software?
Welcome to <a href="https://mobifree.org/">Mobifree</a>, a human-centered, ethical
alternative, that champions privacy over profit and believes in
collaboration, sustainability and inclusiveness.</p>

<p>Everyone is locked into a mobile phone ecosystem where the terms are
dictated by a handful of Big Tech companies all located in a single
country.  From end users looking to download and use their favorite apps, to
developers who run into roadblocks when trying to get their solutions
published, to governments who are increasingly using apps as a way to
provide services to their citizens, we are all impacted by the gatekeeping,
data tracking, and railroading Big Tech is imposing on us in the current
mobile ecosystem. A new alternative is required to shape a better
future. And F-Droid is excited to be a part of creating that new mobile
ecosystem, together with our other partners in Mobifree.</p>

<p><img src="https://f-droid.org/assets/icon_dv5EXg0_UTcQ7wK2dYoloypQJfXvPPbhZ9IEg5nxYFw=.png" alt="NGI Mobifree logo"></p>

<p>For an average user, it is difficult to discern how you are being tracked,
where your private information is being saved, how it is being used and who
it is being sold to. As a long-standing champion of user and developer
rights, pushing for privacy over profit, F-Droid has always been committed
to upholding high open-source standards in the technology we create. For
more than 14 years, F-Droid has been developing solutions which act as
pieces of the alternative mobile ecosystem puzzle. So it was a natural fit
for F-Droid to become a contributing partner in the broader Mobifree
project.</p>

<p>Of particular emphasis is the impact this alternative mobile ecosystem will
have on the services governments provide their citizens. Governments at all
levels are providing services through mobile apps. And in many cases, mobile
apps are becoming the preferred way to access important services. These apps
are only available via the Apple App Store or Google Play. And installing
apps from those stores requires agreeing to their Terms of Services. Both
app stores were built on tracking users to sell their data, thereby giving
Apple and Google power over how citizens receive services from their own
governments. Even the governments themselves are beholden to the Big Tech
gatekeepers: citizens and government officials and employees must use apps
that are only published on Apple and Google.</p>

<p>Austria provides a few specific examples of how governments interact with
the current ecosystem at multiple levels. After COVID-19 countermeasures
forced schools to adopt online learning, many public schools required
education apps for their students, parents and teachers in order to stay
connected. Public health insurance providers require a specific app called
“Handy Signatur” to be downloaded in order for citizens to access their
accounts online. People with the Handy Signatur app can sign petitions, and
download vaccination certificates, sometimes required for work or leisure
activities. Without this app, it is much more work and effort and is
borderline impossible in some cases to engage in certain activities.</p>

<p>Governments around the world are taking action to reign in the dominance of
Big Tech. South Africa and the
<a href="https://theplatformlaw.blog/2021/12/17/the-interim-report-of-the-cmas-market-study-on-mobile-ecosystems-a-great-piece-of-work/">UK</a>
have changed their competition policy to include user freedom in what they
<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/24/24164204/uk-dmcc-law-big-tech-regulation">regulate</a>.
Japan is working on new laws to <a href="https://content.clearygottlieb.com/antitrust/digital-markets-regulation-handbook/japan/index.html">open
up</a>
their mobile markets. And even the US government and many individual US
states have <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/12/19/1220202154/google-to-pay-700-million-in-case-over-whether-its-app-store-is-an-illegal-monop">sued Big
Tech</a>
to stop monopolistic behaviors.</p>

<p>The EU is also taking a step towards creating distance between its citizens
and Big Tech gatekeepers. They passed a landmark law: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Markets_Act">Digital Markets
Act</a>, representing a
whole new approach to tackling gatekeeper companies that aim to keep all
sorts of competition out.  It builds upon the successes of the EU’s General
Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), taking an important step in a more
ethical, democratic and citizens-first direction.  All of these efforts are
helping to open up possibilities for mobile users. And thanks to the
Mobifree partnership, funded by an EU Horizon Europe grant, F-Droid can
share open-source, privacy-driven solutions with a larger audience.</p>

<p>In fact Europe is already seeing significant changes as a result of the
Digital Markets Act (DMA). Google has shut out other app stores by ensuring
that they have a third-class user experience. The DMA means that Google is
now legally forbidden from giving preference to their own app store over
alternatives like F-Droid.  Additionally, Apple has opened up to external
app stores for the first time ever.  And while these are great first steps
in the right direction, regulations and litigation do not build
software. With this in mind, Mobifree is poised to take action on the new
opportunities in the market, to build an unprecedented mobile experience for
users and developers. One that centers around ethical practices, digital
sovereignty, fairness, sustainability and inclusiveness.</p>

<p>F-Droid will play a major role in this project, tasked with creating a
decentralized distribution system for developers to deliver apps to Android
users. The impact will be an opening of the app market for Android,
improving honest competition around app development. And a foundational
guiding principle is to provide privacy controls to users, without locking
anyone out from participating. The app distribution system will focus on a
3-party interaction between app developers, app stores and app users where
every party will have freedom of choice at all points of interaction. The
system will have no terms of service or even user accounts to sign up
for. Developers can publish their own apps, via their own repositories. Any
app store can use those repositories to provide users with a method to
install those apps. And if the app is open source, it can be included in the
main F-Droid.org repository, where it will be reviewed using F-Droid’s
proven ethical review process. Users will be given true choice in terms of
their apps and app store preferences, additional privacy guardrails and
increased transparency into what is happening with their data.</p>

<p>F-Droid is one participating organization who has joined forces to help
create this new mobile ecosystem. However, additional input, expertise,
inspiration and work will be needed in order to break the traditional
framework established by Big Tech. From community outreach to legal support,
from developers, to researchers and end users, we welcome all forms of
support. If you are a curious citizen interested in taking part in the
Mobifree movement, we encourage you to reach out to us at f-droid.org and
see how you can take part in this exciting mobile alternative.</p>

          <strong>Do you ever think that copywriting has become too self-aware for
            its own good?
          </strong>
          It's like we collectively decided to drop the corporate facade of
          prestige in favor of the <em>"wink wink we're fun too!"</em> brand of
          language. From websites to ads to the back of shipping trucks, it
          feels like every company's identity has become a collection of short
          statements vaguely related to their industry, in pun form, devoid of
          any actual attempt at humor. It's akin to a child trying to formulate
          a joke: clearly understanding the structure and the components of
          comedy, yet missing what makes it funny. I'm not saying this is
          necessarily a good or a bad thing, it's just something that I have
          noticed. It makes sense to do something like that
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xx5YqFKjTCY" target="_blank">if you're writing posters for a animated movie</a>, but when it comes to companies valued higher than the GDP of some
          countries it loses all relatability. Let's be real, if this charade of
          a website was an actual startup, we'd probably wear t-shirts that say
          <em>"This isn't a revolution. It's 33<span id="third">⅓</span>
            of them."</em>
          while we'd get articles written about our fun company culture, the Bob
          Dylan quotes graffiti'd on the wall, the meeting rooms named after
          each of the Jackson 5, and the pink neon in the entrance that says
          <em>"Like a record, Baby."</em>. Oh, and while I'm at it what is it
          with the period after each of those taglines? Normally I am not one to
          complain about proper punctuation but at this point it seems more like
          a thinly veiled attempt at recapturing some of that seriousness
          combined with an unwillingness to commit to the bit. Because they
          really want you to know that to them, it's not a joke. it's a
          statement.
        </p>

        <p id="oh">
          On a slightly unrelated note, I made an app that helps you
          <span id="highlight">calibrate your turntable.</span>
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2 id="mj">As easy as 1-2-3.</h2>

      <p>
        Do you remember the early days of the iPhone, where every once in a
        while a new app would come out and it would do just one completely new
        thing, and nothing else? There was so much excitement around finding new
        use cases and it was all
        <em>"Oh yeah this is the app I use to pretend I'm shaving my face. And
          this is app I use to see where the ISS is"</em>. I can't remember the last time I genuinely got excited about some
        unitasker app like that and I think that's too bad. That's why Grooved
        tells you your turntable's speed <strong>in just one tap.</strong>

<p>The quality of the air we breathe is among the biggest factors influencing human health and well-being worldwide.

<p>Safeguarding public health and combating climate change depend on robust impact assessments and eﬀective policymaking with respect to air quality, which in turn require an accurate understanding of air composition and the processes that control how and why it changes.</p>

<p>For decades, scientists have applied multiscale modeling approaches informed by observations to help advance the understanding and predictability of air quality and its interactions with the climate. Such investigations are becoming more in-depth, more capable of revealing details of the processes at play, and more accessible to broader communities.</p>

<p>Key to the continued success of such approaches is that the models used keep up with advances in scientific knowledge, modeling techniques, and the capabilities of Earth-observing systems and that the valuable features of the models are well recognized by the scientists and decisionmakers who interpret their results.</p>

<p>Here we look back on the history of one such influential model, the pioneering Sulfur Transport and Deposition Model (STEM), and we look forward to how it can keep revealing more about air quality, climate, and other societally important issues.</p>

<h3><strong>Sulfur Model Shows the Way</strong></h3>

<figure><blockquote><p>Development of the Sulfur Transport and Deposition Model (STEM) started in 1976. At the time, fossil fuel consumption was setting records, and effective technologies for scrubbing sulfur species from emissions were not widely implemented.</p></blockquote></figure>

<p>Development of STEM started in 1976, much earlier than many other contemporary air quality and atmospheric chemistry models. At the time, fossil fuel consumption was setting records, and effective technologies for scrubbing sulfur species from emissions were not widely implemented. The resulting atmospheric <a href="https://eos.org/research-spotlights/effects-of-acid-rain-climate-change-on-freshwater-lakes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sulfur pollution and acid rain</a> caused increasingly negative impacts on humans, infrastructure, and ecosystems. These impacts also raised awareness that air pollution was not just a local problem: Emissions from one place could affect other places hundreds and even thousands of kilometers downwind. STEM was initially designed to help understand the transport, transformation, and removal processes of atmospheric sulfur and to inform emissions reduction strategies [<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/0004-6981(84)90070-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Carmichael and Peters</em></a>, 1984].</p>


<p>Since its creation, STEM has evolved to cover a broader set of key air pollutants, such as ozone and particulate matter, which also cause regional and even intercontinental problems [<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/0960-1686(91)90085-L" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Carmichael et al.</em></a>, 1991; <a href="https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-17-5721-2017" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Huang et al.</em></a>, 2017]. Coupled with widely used meteorological models, including multiple versions of the <a href="https://www.mmm.ucar.edu/models/wrf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Weather Research and Forecasting</a> and <a href="https://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/mm5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MM5</a> models, STEM has been adopted to study air quality in the United States and regions in the Arctic, Asia, and South America, contributing to hundreds of peer-reviewed publications. These studies have highlighted the usefulness of such models for addressing a wide range of scientific questions related to the atmospheric distributions of chemicals, quantification of these chemicals’ environmental impacts, and evaluation of environmental mitigation strategies.</p>

<p>By answering these science questions, STEM also has demonstrated the capability of models to support the design and deployment of airborne and ground-based ﬁeld experiments, many of which have been <a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2002JD003117" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">led by NASA</a> or other agencies. For example, during the 2001 NASA Transport and Chemical Evolution over the Pacific (<a href="https://www-air.larc.nasa.gov/missions/tracep/tracep.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TRACE-P</a>) experiment, based out of Hong Kong, STEM forecasts of pollution outflow regions over the Pacific Ocean were used daily to help plan locations for aircraft sampling of air pollutants (Figure 1). Applying STEM in the field by design also enabled its use in interpreting and providing context for collected observations, which in turn helped improve the model [<a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2002JD003117" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Carmichael et al.</em></a>, 2003]. The use of air quality models in such forecast applications has since expanded dramatically, and today these models are used operationally at urban, national, and global scales.</p>

<p>STEM has further served scientific communities by advancing satellite missions, such as <a href="https://aura.gsfc.nasa.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aura</a>. It has supported <a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2346/background-ozone-a-major-issue-in-us-west/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">novel applications</a> of the main data products from Aura’s onboard sensors [e.g., <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/2014JD022993" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Huang et al.</em></a>, 2015], for example, and stimulated development and evaluation of <a href="https://asdc.larc.nasa.gov/project/TES/TL2OCSN_8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new retrieval products</a>. And it has contributed to international multimodel intercomparison experiments, including the <a href="https://www.acap.asia/en/research-main/mics-asia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Model Inter-Comparison Study for Asia</a> [<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S1352-2310(01)00448-4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Carmichael et al.</em></a>, 2002] and the <a href="https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-17-5721-2017" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Task Force on Hemispheric Transport of Air Pollution</a> [<a href="https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-17-5721-2017" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Huang et al.</em></a>, 2017]. These experiments helped provide more robust estimates of air pollution source-receptor relationships and environmental impacts, and they helped scientists better understand the strengths and weaknesses of the various models compared.</p>

<h3><strong>Simplicity, Stability, and Flexibility</strong></h3>

<figure><blockquote><p>The long history and wide applications of STEM have helped shape its main technical strengths.</p></blockquote></figure>

<p>The long history and wide applications of STEM have helped shape its main technical strengths. These strengths include its structural simplicity, which allows users to make changes to it easily, and its stability, which is built upon decades of tuning with field and laboratory measurements and other information from past applications. In addition, it features ﬂexible tools to generate chemical boundary conditions and other key inputs as well as advanced data assimilation capability. Of particular note is the development of the <a href="https://people.cs.vt.edu/~asandu/Software/Kpp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kinetic PreProcessor</a> software, which allowed for easily changing the chemical mechanisms used in STEM (and other models) and improved its ability to assimilate observational data [<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2004.10.011" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Sandu et al.</em></a>, 2005].</p>

<p>These features have enabled researchers using the model to make notable policy-relevant scientific contributions in both the air quality and climate communities and to train dozens of students and early-career scientists globally. Such contributions include using real-world observations to derive surface-atmosphere ﬂuxes of short- and long-lived climate forcers and their precursors—such as nitrogen oxides, carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), carbonyl sulfide (COS), and toxic airborne materials including mercury compounds—and to understand the factors controlling them [e.g., <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1164015" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Campbell et al.</em></a>, 2008].</p>

<p>STEM also has helped in attributing the effects of aerosols on air quality and climate to emissions from different source sectors (e.g., energy production, industrial processes, transportation, residential sources, and wildfires) and in identifying sources of air pollution as atmospheric circulation and emissions patterns shift under the changing climate [e.g., <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/ngeo156" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Ramanathan and Carmichael</em></a>, 2008; <em>Huang et al.</em>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2012.01.021" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2012</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/2014JD022993" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2015</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-17-5721-2017" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2017</a>].</p>

<p>These studies based on the STEM model have inspired subsequent research and discussions about new applications. For example, they stimulated discussions on using COS as <a href="https://eos.org/features/assessing-a-new-clue-to-how-much-carbon-plants-take-up" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a proxy for gross primary productivity</a> because of the link between plants’ uptake of COS and CO<sub>2</sub>, which further led to developing and applying satellite-based data products to track COS.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, researchers are continuing to develop methods to reduce uncertainties in estimating how aerosol and greenhouse gas emissions from different regions and source sectors affect health and climate. In part, these efforts involve integrating Earth observations across multiple disciplines to improve process-level constraints used in making these estimates. Observation-driven analyses are also being advanced to improve estimates of background air pollution levels, information that is relevant for updating air quality standards as the climate changes.</p>

<h3><strong>Keeping Current to Stay Relevant</strong></h3>

<figure><blockquote><p>As productive as STEM has been through its history, updating it is necessary to ensure that it remains a robust option for air quality and climate scientists to study our environment and to inform policymaking.</p></blockquote></figure>

<p>Maintaining and enhancing the diversity of models available for air quality science and management are important because significant uncertainties remain in the predictions (and their implications) from individual models. In addition, as productive as STEM has been through its history, updating it (and similar models) is necessary to ensure that it remains a robust option for air quality and climate scientists to study our environment and to inform policymaking and the design of atmospheric observing systems.</p>

<p>Major updates to STEM are ongoing to improve how the model interfaces with up-to-date and next-generation meteorological and land surface modeling systems. These systems include, for example, the <a href="https://www.mmm.ucar.edu/models/mpas" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Model for Prediction Across Scales</a>, which can be run at variable resolutions, and the <a href="https://ral.ucar.edu/model/noah-multiparameterization-land-surface-model-noah-mp-lsm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Noah-Multiparameterization land surface model</a>, which can simulate vegetation dynamics under many configurations. Such updates can facilitate improved representations of processes like atmospheric deposition. STEM also will be more closely integrated with regional and global climate models, and it will be applied at progressively finer, satellite-resolved scales of several kilometers or less.</p>

<p>We continue to collect community input on goals and updates for STEM, and suggestions are always welcome. Ideally, STEM (and other chemical transport models) should be adapted to perform on new generations of high-performance supercomputing systems, perhaps in combination with <a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/24938/chapter/7#177" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">commercial cloud computing</a>, artificial intelligence and machine learning, and other technologies.</p>

<p>Additional updates could include capabilities to provide detailed documentation of model elements, features, and steps to execute it, as well as polished postprocessing and visualization routines to help improve the interpretability and communication of model results. Further, models could be updated to support crowdsourced science projects, by integrating data from or feeding data to them, and the design and application of low-cost spaceborne and surface observing systems. User communities should be able to access and contribute easily to synthesized and modernized models and their associated documentation from centralized, open-access platforms.</p>

<p>These updates would allow models like STEM to be implemented over wider spatial and time scales than previously possible and to support studies of emerging topics, such as those <a href="https://eos.org/articles/some-communities-feel-the-effects-of-air-pollution-more-than-others" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">related to environmental justice</a>. Simulations of regional to local air quality as well as of its contributing factors, combined with socioeconomic data, could clarify the picture of <a href="https://eos.org/articles/indias-disadvantaged-groups-face-more-air-pollution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">environmental inequity</a> across an area of interest and help evaluate potential solutions involving migration, relocation, or <a href="https://eos.org/science-updates/converging-on-solutions-to-plan-sustainable-cities" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">urban</a> or <a href="https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/video/what-ecosystem-based-adaptation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ecosystem</a> adaptations.</p>

<p>For decades, the STEM model has proven its value by contributing insights into air quality, climate, and the environment to help shape scientific understanding, science-based policymaking, and software design. With the ongoing and envisioned updates, the model’s usefulness for these purposes will continue for many years to come, and its relevance for new applications will grow.</p>

It is an excellent choice for plugin systems, cloud hosts and as smart contract execution engine.</p><p>Wasmi intentionally mirrors the Wasmtime API on a best-effort basis, making it an ideal drop-in replacement or prototyping runtime.</p><blockquote><p>Install <a href="https://crates.io/crates/wasmi_cli">Wasmi’s CLI tool</a> via <code>cargo install wasmi_cli</code> or use it as library via the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/wasmi"><code>wasmi</code> crate</a>.</p></blockquote><p>Wasmi v0.32 comes with a new execution engine that utilizes register-based bytecode enhancing its execution performance by a factor of up to 5.
Additionally, its startup performance has been improved by several orders of magnitudes thanks to lazy compilation and other new techniques.</p><p>The <a href="https://github.com/wasmi-labs/wasmi/releases/tag/v0.32.0">changelog for v0.32</a> is huge and the following sections will present the most significant changes.</p><h2 id="startup-performance">Startup Performance</h2><p>Wasmi is a <em>rewriting interpreter</em>, meaning that it rewrites the incoming WebAssembly bytecode into Wasmi’s own internal bytecode that is geared towards efficient execution performance.</p><p>This re-writing is what we call <em>compilation</em> or <em>translation</em> in an interpreter. This is not to be confused with compiling the Wasmi interpreter itself.</p><h3 id="why-is-translation-speed-important-for-wasmi">Why is translation speed important for Wasmi?</h3><p>Fast translation enables a fast startup time which is the time spent until the first instruction is executed.</p><p>As an interpreter, Wasmi is naturally optimized for fast startup times, making it well-suited for translation-intensive workloads where the time required to translate a Wasm binary exceeds the time needed to execute it.<br>Conversely, compute-intensive workloads, where execution time surpasses translation time, are better handled by JIT-based Wasm runtimes such as <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime">Wasmtime</a>, <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-micro-runtime">WAMR</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer">Wasmer</a>. <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p><h3 id="lazy-translation">Lazy Translation</h3><p>Translation can be costly, especially with the new register-based bytecode. To address this, lazy translation has been implemented, translating only the parts of the Wasm binary necessary for execution.</p><p>Wasmi supports 3 different modes of translation:</p><ul><li><code>Eager</code>: Code is eagerly validated and eagerly translated ahead of time.<ul><li><strong>Note:</strong> This is the default mode for Wasmi v0.32.</li></ul></li><li><code>Lazy</code>: Code is lazily translated and lazily validated.<ul><li><strong>Note:</strong> One downside is that this allows for partially validated Wasm modules which are controversial within the wider Wasm community. <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></li></ul></li><li><code>LazyTranslation</code>: Code is lazily translated but eagerly validated.<ul><li><strong>Note:</strong> While slower than <code>Lazy</code> this fixes the problem with partially validated Wasm modules.</li></ul></li></ul><h4 id="usage-as-library">Usage as Library</h4><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span><span>let</span> <span>mut</span> c <span>=</span> wasmi::Config::default();

However, some users might want to skip Wasm validation altogether since they know ahead of time that used Wasm binaries are pre-validated. This is now possible via the <code>unsafe fn Module::new_unchecked</code> API.</p><h3 id="non-streaming-translation">Non-streaming Translation</h3><p>Wasmi v0.31 and earlier always used streaming translation to process their Wasm input.

As expected, optimizing JIT-based Wasm runtimes like Wasmtime and Wasmer perform worse in this context. Single-pass JITs, which are designed for fast startup, such as <a href="https://crates.io/crates/wasmtime-winch">Winch</a> and <a href="https://crates.io/crates/wasmer-compiler-singlepass">Wasmer Singlepass</a>, are also significantly slower. Despite also using lazy translation, <a href="https://github.com/makepad/stitch">Stitch</a>’s translation performance is not ideal. However, it is important to note that both Winch and Stitch are still in an experimental phase of their development and improvements are to be expected.</p><h2 id="execution-speed">Execution Speed</h2><p>For an execution engine, the speed of computation is naturally of paramount importance. Unfortunately, the old Wasmi v0.31 left much to be desired in this regard.</p><h2 id="register-based-bytecode">Register-Based Bytecode</h2><p>The old Wasmi v0.31 internally uses a stack-based intermediate representation (IR) to drive execution. This IR is similar to WebAssembly bytecode and thus allows for fast translation times.</p><p>Stack-based IRs generally use more instructions to represent the same problem as register-based IRs. <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> However, the performance of interpreters is mostly dictated by the dispatch of instructions. Hence, it is usually a good tradeoff to execute fewer instructions even if every executed instruction is more complex. <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup></p><p>This is why starting with version 0.32 Wasmi now uses a register-based IR to drive its execution.</p><h2 id="memory-consumption">Memory Consumption</h2><p>The new register-based IR was carefully designed to enhance execution performance and to minimize memory usage.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div class="page">
  <p>
    Published 27 May, 2024 by Louis Pilfold
  </p>
<p>Gleam is a type safe and scalable language for the Erlang virtual machine and
JavaScript runtimes. Today Gleam <a href="https://github.com/gleam-lang/gleam/releases/tag/v1.2.0">v1.2.0</a> has been published, a release
that focuses on improving the language server and developer experience. It’s a
big one both in terms of size and impact, so let’s take a look as what it
includes.</p>

<h2 id="fault-tolerant-compilation">Fault tolerant compilation</h2>

<p>Gleam’s compiler has traditionally halted immediately when a compile time error
was encountered, presenting the error to the programmer and requiring them to
fix it before compilation can be attempted again.</p>

<p>The main advantage of this is that the programmer has just the first and
most important error, rather than a mix of the real error and a bunch of
red-herring cascading errors. On the other hand, if there’s multiple genuine
errors the programmer can only see first the one, which may not be the one they
want to work on, or the most understandable.</p>

<p>Even worse, this halting behaviour causes major issues for the Gleam Language
Server (the engine that text editors like Neovim, Helix, Zed, and VS Code use to
get IDE features for Gleam). The language server internally uses the compiler to
build and analyse Gleam projects, so when the compiler halts with an error the
language server is left without up-to-date information about the code. Without a
successful build some language server features may not work, and the longer a
project goes without successful compilation (such as during a large refactoring)
the more drift there can be between the language server’s understanding of the
code and the reality.</p>

<p>With this release when the compiler encounters an error during analysis it will
move on to the next definition in the module, returning all of the errors along
with updated code information once the whole module has been analysed. This has
resulted in a dramatic improvement in the experience when using the Gleam
language server, it being much more responsive and accurate in its feedback.</p>

<p>In future releases we will continue to improve the granularity of the fault
tolerant compilation and we will also introduce fault tolerant parsing.</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/Acepie">Ameen Radwan</a> and myself for this feature!</p>

<h2 id="language-server-imports-improvements">Language server imports improvements</h2>

<p>This is a Gleam import statement:</p>
<pre><code>import gleam/option.{type Option, Some, None}
//     ^^^^^^^^^^^^  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
//      the module     unqualified imports
</code></pre>

<p>The language server could previously autocomplete module names, but now it can
also autocomplete types and values when importing them in the unqualified
fashion.</p>

<p>You can also hover types and values in an import statement to see their
documentation, and use go-to definition on them and the module itself to jump
to where they defined in your project or its dependencies.</p>

<h2 id="single-line-pipelines">Single line pipelines</h2>

<p>Gleam’s much loved <code>|&gt;</code> pipe operator can be used to pipe the output from one
function into the input of another, not dissimilar to <code>|</code> pipes in bash, etc.
Gleam’s code formatter would always put each function of a sequence of pipes on
individual lines, but now you can opt to put them all on one line, so long as
altogether they are short enough to fit.</p>
<pre><code>[1, 2, 3] |&gt; list.map(int.to_string) |&gt; string.join(with: "\n")
</code></pre>

<p>In addition you can also force the formatter to break a pipe on multiple lines
by adding a line break. This:</p>
<pre><code>[1, 2, 3] |&gt; list.map(int.to_string)
// By putting a newline here I'm telling the formatter to split the pipeline
|&gt; string.join(with: "\n")
</code></pre>

<p>Will turn into this:</p>
<pre><code>[1, 2, 3]
|&gt; list.map(int.to_string)
|&gt; string.join(with: "\n")
</code></pre>

<p>Thank you to our formatter wizard <a href="https://github.com/giacomocavalieri">Giacomo Cavalieri</a>
for this feature!</p>

<h2 id="improved-error-messages-for-use-expressions">Improved error messages for <code>use</code> expressions</h2>

<p>Gleam’s <a href="https://tour.gleam.run/advanced-features/use-sugar/"><code>use</code> expressions</a>
are very powerful and can be used to replicate many built-in features of other
languages such as Go’s <code>defer</code>, procedural languages’ early returns, Haskell’s
do-notation, and more. As an unusual and powerful feature they can be confusing
at first, and that was made worse as any type errors from incorrect <code>use</code>
expressions would be generic ones rather than being specific to <code>use</code>.</p>

<p>These errors have been greatly refined and we hope this will help folks learning
the language and debugging their code. Here’s some specific examples:</p>

<p>This error message is used when the right-hand-side of <code>&lt;-</code> in a <code>use</code>
expression is not a function:</p>
<pre><code>error: Type mismatch
  ┌─ /src/one/two.gleam:2:8
  │
2 │ use &lt;- 123
  │        ^^^

In a use expression, there should be a function on the right hand side of
`&lt;-`, but this value has type:

    Int

See: https://tour.gleam.run/advanced-features/use/
</code></pre>

<p>This error message is used when the right-hand-side of <code>&lt;-</code> is a function,
but it takes no arguments:</p>
<pre><code>error: Incorrect arity
  ┌─ /src/one/two.gleam:3:8
  │
3 │ use &lt;- func
  │        ^^^^ Expected no arguments, got 1

The function on the right of `&lt;-` here takes no arguments.
But it has to take at least one argument, a callback function.

See: https://tour.gleam.run/advanced-features/use/
</code></pre>

<p>And this one is used when it takes arguments, but not the correct number of
arguments:</p>
<pre><code>error: Incorrect arity
  ┌─ /src/one/two.gleam:3:8
  │
3 │ use &lt;- f(1, 2)
  │        ^^^^^^^ Expected 2 arguments, got 3

The function on the right of `&lt;-` here takes 2 arguments.
All the arguments have already been supplied, so it cannot take the
`use` callback function as a final argument.

See: https://tour.gleam.run/advanced-features/use/
</code></pre>

<p>And more! Too many to list here. Thank you to <a href="https://github.com/giacomocavalieri">Giacomo Cavalieri</a>
for these big improvements!</p>

<h2 id="typevalue-mix-up-feedback">Type/value mix up feedback</h2>

<p>One common mistake is to try and import a type as a value, or a value as a type.
When an imported item is found not to exist the compiler will now check to see
if there is a matching type or value and explain the mix-up.</p>
<pre><code>error: Unknown module field
  ┌─ /src/one/two.gleam:1:19
  │
1 │ import gleam/one.{One}
  │                   ^^^ Did you mean `type One`?

`One` is only a type, it cannot be imported as a value.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>error: Unknown module type
  ┌─ /src/one/two.gleam:1:19
  │
1 │ import gleam/two.{type Two}
  │                   ^^^^^^^^ Did you mean `Two`?

`Two` is only a value, it cannot be imported as a type.
</code></pre>

<p>Thank you <a href="https://github.com/Pi-Cla/">Pi-Cla</a> for this feature!</p>

<h2 id="assertion-exhaustiveness-checking">Assertion exhaustiveness checking</h2>

<p>Gleam has a <code>let assert</code> syntax to apply a pattern to a value, extracting values
contained within if the pattern matches, and crashing the program if it does
not.</p>

<p>The compiler now performs exhaustiveness checking on these assertions to find
patterns that are total and warn that the <code>assert</code> is redundant as a result.</p>
<pre><code>warning: Redundant assertion
  ┌─ /home/lucy/src/app/src/app.gleam:4:7
  │
4 │   let assert x = get_name()
  │       ^^^^^^ You can remove this

This assertion is redundant since the pattern covers all possibilities.
</code></pre>

<p>Thank you <a href="https://github.com/giacomocavalieri">Giacomo Cavalieri</a> for this feature.</p>

<h2 id="catching-common-crash-mistakes">Catching common crash mistakes</h2>

<p>Gleam has <code>todo</code> and <code>panic</code> expressions, both of which crash the program due to
it being incomplete or in an invalid state respectively. The syntax looks like
this:</p>
<pre><code>panic as "The session is no longer valid, this should never happen!"
</code></pre>

<p>A common mistake is to try and give the message string using the function call
syntax like so:</p>
<pre><code>panic("The session is no longer valid, this should never happen!")
</code></pre>

<p>This is valid Gleam code, but it is not using that string as a message for the
panic. The string unreachable as the program panics before it is evaluated. A
compiler warning is now emitted when code like this is found.</p>
<pre><code>warning: Todo used as a function
  ┌─ /src/warning/wrn.gleam:2:16
  │
2 │           todo(1)
  │                ^

`todo` is not a function and will crash before it can do anything with
this argument.

Hint: if you want to display an error message you should write
`todo as "my error message"`
See: https://tour.gleam.run/advanced-features/todo/
</code></pre>

<p>Thank you <a href="https://github.com/giacomocavalieri">Giacomo Cavalieri</a> for this feature!</p>

<h2 id="invalid-constant-error-message-improvement">Invalid constant error message improvement</h2>

<p>Gleam’s constants are limited to a subset of the language that be evaluated at
compile time, and as such arbitrary functions cannot be called within them.
Previously if you tried to call a function you would get a somewhat confusing
parse error, but with this version it’ll emit a much more helpful error message.</p>
<pre><code>error: Syntax error
  ┌─ /src/parse/error.gleam:3:18
  │
3 │ const wib: Int = wibble(1, "wobble")
  │                  ^^^^^^^ Functions can only be called within other functions
</code></pre>

<p>Thank you <a href="https://github.com/nino">Nino Annighoefer</a> for this improvement!</p>

<h2 id="unreachable-code-detection">Unreachable code detection</h2>

<p>Code that comes after a <code>panic</code> expression is unreachable and will never be
evaluated as the program will crash before it is reached. The compiler will now
warn in these situations to catch these mistakes.</p>

<p>For example, this code will emit this warning:</p>

<pre><code>pub fn main() {
  panic
  my_app.run()
}
</code></pre>
<pre><code>warning: Unreachable code
  ┌─ /src/warning/wrn.gleam:3:11
  │
3 │    my_app.run()
  │    ^^^^^^^^^^^^

This code is unreachable because it comes after a `panic`.
</code></pre>

<p>Thank you <a href="https://github.com/giacomocavalieri">Giacomo Cavalieri</a> for this feature!</p>

<h2 id="further-hex-integration">Further Hex integration</h2>

<p>Gleam is part of the Erlang ecosystem, and as such it uses the
<a href="https://hex.pm/">Hex package manager</a>.</p>

<p>The <code>gleam hex revert</code> has been added to the Gleam binary. It can be used to
unpublish a package release within the first 24 hours of it being published.
After 24 hours Hex package releases become immutable and cannot be removed.</p>

<p>Additionally the error message that is emitted when you attempt to publish a
package that has already been published has been improved:</p>
<pre><code>error: Version already published

Version v1.0.0 has already been published.
This release has been recently published so you can replace it
or you can publish it using a different version number

Hint: Please add the --replace flag if you want to replace the release.
</code></pre>

<p>Thank you <a href="https://github.com/Pi-Cla">Pi-Cla</a> for these features!</p>

<h2 id="erlang-module-collision-prevention">Erlang module collision prevention</h2>

<p>The Erlang virtual machine supports loading new versions of existing module,
enabling an application to be upgraded while it is still running. One
unfortunate consequence of this is that if you accidentally reuse a module name
loading it into the VM will cause the application to be upgraded to the new
version, causing confusing errors as functions that no longer exist are called
and crash.</p>

<p>The Gleam build tool would return an error and refuse to compile Gleam modules
that would overwrite each other, but with this version it will also emit an
error if a Gleam module would overwrite a built-in Erlang/OTP module.</p>
<pre><code>error: Erlang module name collision

The module `src/code.gleam` compiles to an Erlang module named `code`.

By default Erlang includes a module with the same name so if we were to
compile and load your module it would overwrite the Erlang one, potentially
causing confusing errors and crashes.

Hint: Rename this module and try again.
</code></pre>



<p>A helpful error message is now shown if the <code>manifest.toml</code> file has become
invalid, perhaps due to a git rebase or accidental edit.</p>
<pre><code>error: Corrupt manifest.toml

The `manifest.toml` file is corrupt.

Hint: Please run `gleam update` to fix it.
</code></pre>

<p>Previously when no package versions could be found that satisfy the project’s
requirements a very cryptic message would printed that detailed all the
constraints from all the versions that were incompatible. This was overwhelming
and practically impossible to read, so it has been replaced with a much simpler
message.</p>
<pre><code>error: Dependency resolution failed

An error occurred while determining what dependency packages and
versions should be downloaded.
The error from the version resolver library was:

Unable to find compatible versions for the version constraints in your
gleam.toml. The conflicting packages are:

- hellogleam
- lustre_dev_tools
- glint
</code></pre>

<p>Thank you <a href="https://github.com/zahash">zahash</a> for these improvements!</p>

<h2 id="redundant-pattern-matching-warnings">Redundant pattern matching warnings</h2>

<p>Gleam’s case expressons support pattern matching on multiple values at the same
time. This is uncommon so people used to other languages may habitually wrap
multiple values in a tuple or a list to match on them. The compiler will now
warn when this is done:</p>
<pre><code>warning: Redundant list
  ┌─ /src/warning/wrn.gleam:2:14
  │
2 │         case [1, 2] {
  │              ^^^^^^ You can remove this list wrapper

Instead of building a list and matching on it, you can match on its
contents directly.
A case expression can take multiple subjects separated by commas like this:

    case one_subject, another_subject {
      _, _ -&gt; todo
    }

See: https://tour.gleam.run/flow-control/multiple-subjects/
</code></pre>

<p>Thank you <a href="https://github.com/giacomocavalieri">Giacomo Cavalieri</a> for this feature.</p>

<h2 id="redundant-pattern-matching-auto-fix">Redundant pattern matching auto-fix</h2>

<p>And further still, if you are using the Gleam language server then a code action
is offered to automatically fix redundant tuple wrappers. Place your cursor on
the tuple and select this language action and the language server will remove
the tuple from the values as well as from all patterns in the case expression.</p>
<pre><code>case #(x, y) {
  #(1, 2) -&gt; 0
  #(_, _) -&gt; 1
}
</code></pre>
<p>Is rewritten to:</p>
<pre><code>case x, y {
  1, 2 -&gt; 0
  _, _ -&gt; 1
}
</code></pre>
<p>Thank you <a href="https://github.com/nicklimmm">Nicky Lim</a> for this code action, and
for laying the foundation for other code actions like this in future!</p>

<h2 id="a-helping-hand-for-javascript-programmers">A helping hand for JavaScript programmers</h2>

<p>JavaScript programmers sometimes type <code>===</code> by mistake in their Gleam code. We
have an error message for that too now:</p>
<pre><code>error: Syntax error
  ┌─ /src/parse/error.gleam:4:37
  │
4 │   [1,2,3] |&gt; list.filter(fn (a) { a === 3 })
  │                                     ^^^ Did you mean `==`?

Gleam uses `==` to check for equality between two values.
See: https://tour.gleam.run/basics/equality
</code></pre>

<p>Thank you <a href="https://github.com/rabingaire">Rabin Gaire</a> for this feature!</p>

<div data-id="4593eca" data-element_type="section"><div data-id="c9ae56f" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><p><span>I have reviewed the API reference docs and contextualized them with some other </span><a href="https://www.zachvorhies.com/google_leaks/"><span>previous Google leaks</span></a><span> and the DOJ antitrust testimony. I’m combining that with the extensive patent and whitepaper research done for my upcoming book, </span><a href="https://www.target.com/p/the-science-of-seo-by-michael-king-paperback/-/A-88453513"><span>The Science of SEO</span></a><span>. While there is no detail about Google’s scoring functions in the documentation I’ve reviewed, there is a wealth of information about data stored for content, links, and user interactions. There are also varying degrees of descriptions (ranging from disappointingly sparse to surprisingly revealing) of the features being manipulated and stored.</span></p><p><span>You’d be tempted to broadly call these “ranking factors,” but that would be imprecise. Many, even most, of them </span><i><span>are</span></i><span> ranking factors, but many are not. What I’ll do here is contextualize some of the most interesting ranking systems and features (at least, those I was able to find in the first few hours of reviewing this massive leak) based on my extensive research and things that Google has told/lied to us about over the years.</span></p><p><span>“Lied” is harsh, but it’s the only accurate word to use here. While I don’t necessarily fault Google’s public representatives for protecting their proprietary information, I do take issue with their efforts to actively discredit people in the marketing, tech, and journalism worlds who have presented reproducible discoveries. My advice to future Googlers speaking on these topics: Sometimes it’s better to simply say “we can’t talk about that.” Your credibility matters, and when leaks like this and testimony like the DOJ trial come out, it becomes impossible to trust your future statements.</span></p></div><div data-id="233ef67" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="heading.default"><p><h2>The Caveats</h2></p></div><div data-id="e4ed9cf" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><p><span>I think we all know people will work to discredit my findings and analysis from this leak. Some will question why it matters and say “but we already knew that.” So, let’s get the caveats out of the way before we get to the good stuff.</span></p><ul><li aria-level="1"><b>Limited Time and Context – </b><span>With the holiday weekend, I’ve only been able to spend about 12 hours or so in deep concentration on all this. I’m incredibly thankful to some anonymous parties that were super helpful in sharing their insights with me to help me get up to speed quickly. Also, similar to </span><a href="https://searchengineland.com/yandex-leak-learnings-392393"><span>the Yandex leak I covered last year</span></a><span>, I do not have a complete picture. Where we had source code to parse through and none of the thinking behind it for Yandex, in this case we have some of the thinking behind thousands of features and modules,&nbsp; but no source code. You’ll have to forgive me for sharing this in a less structured way than I will in a few weeks after I’ve sat with the material longer.</span></li><li aria-level="1"><b>No Scoring Functions – </b><span>We do not know how features are weighted in the various downstream scoring functions. We don’t know if everything available is being used.&nbsp; We do know some features are deprecated. Unless explicitly indicated, we don’t know how things are being used. We don’t know where everything happens in the pipeline. We have a series of named </span><a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/ranking-systems-guide"><span>ranking systems</span></a><span> that loosely align with how Google has explained them, how SEOs have observed rankings in the wild, and how patent applications and IR literature explains. Ultimately, thanks to this leak, we now have a clearer picture of what is being considered that can inform what we focus on vs. ignore in SEO moving forward.</span></li><li aria-level="1"><b>Likely the First of Several Posts – </b><span>This post will be my initial stab of what I’ve reviewed. I may publish subsequent posts as I continue to dig into the details. I suspect this article will lead to the SEO community racing to parse through these docs and we will, collectively, be discovering and recontextualizing things for months to come.</span></li><li aria-level="1"><b>This Appears to Be Current Information – </b><span>As best I can tell, this leak represents the current, active architecture of Google Search Content Storage as of March of 2024. (Cue a Google PR person saying I’m wrong. Actually let’s just skip the song and dance, y’all). Based on the commit history, the related code was pushed on on Mar 27, 2024 and not removed until May 7, 2024.<br></span></li></ul></div><div data-id="6e80a60" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="image.default"><p><img decoding="async" width="789" height="472" src="https://ipullrank.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image44.png" alt="A screenshot of the repository commits with visual proof that the information was committed on May 7th 2024." srcset="https://ipullrank.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image44.png 789w, https://ipullrank.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image44-300x179.png 300w, https://ipullrank.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image44-768x459.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 789px) 100vw, 789px"></p></div><div data-id="c1a3ba6" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><ul><li><b>Correlation is not causation</b> – Ok, this one doesn’t really apply here, but I just wanted to make sure I covered all the bases.</li></ul></div><div data-id="4a950c4" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="heading.default"><p><h2>There are 14K Ranking Features and More in the Docs</h2></p></div><div data-id="5e8ae2d" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><p><span>There are 2,596 modules represented in the API documentation with 14,014 attributes (features) that look like this:</span></p></div><div data-id="e4a258d" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="image.default"><p><img decoding="async" width="914" height="894" src="https://ipullrank.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image20.png" alt="Screenshot of API Documentation with the following text: GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.CompressedQualitySignals A message containing per doc signals that are compressed and included in Mustang and TeraGoogle.

I'll answer this quickly because I'm waiting for a plane and I'm bored (I'm supposed to answer questions tomorrow). RankBrain is a PR-sexy machine learning ranking component that uses historical search data to predict what would a user most likely click on for a previously unseen query. It is a really cool piece of engineering that saved our butts countless times whenever traditional algos were like, e.g. &quot;oh look a 'not' in the query string! let's ignore the hell out of it!&quot;, but it's generally just relying on (sometimes) months old data about what happened on the results page itself, not on the landing page. Dwell time, CTR, whatever Fishkin's new theory is, those are generally made up crap. Search is much more simple than people think.

So, it’s not enough to just perform the search and click the result, users need to also spend a significant amount of time on the page. Long clicks are a measure of the success of a search session just like dwell time, but there is no specific feature called “dwell time” in this documentation. Nevertheless, long clicks are effectively measures of the same thing, contradicting Google’s </span><a href="https://www.seroundtable.com/google-ctr-dwell-time-signals-myths-27083.html"><span>statements</span></a><span> on the matter.</span></p><p><span>Various </span><a href="https://www.blindfiveyearold.com/what-pandu-nayak-taught-me-about-seo"><span>sources</span></a><span> have </span><a href="https://thecapitolforum.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/101823-USA-v-Google-PM.pdf"><span>indicated</span></a><span> that NavBoost is </span><a href="https://www.buildersociety.com/threads/what-can-we-learn-about-seo-from-googles-leaked-documents.4435/"><span>“already one of Google’s strongest ranking signals”</span></a><span>. The leaked documentation specifies “Navboost” by name 84 times with five modules featuring Navboost in the title. There is also evidence that they contemplate its scoring on the subdomain, root domain, and URL level which inherently indicates they treat different levels of a site differently. I won’t go into the subdomain vs. sudirectory argument, but later we’ll discuss how the data from the system has also informed the Panda algorithm.</span></p><p><span>So, yes, Google does not mention “CTR” or “dwell time” by those exact words in this documentation, but the spirit of what Rand proved: clicks on search results and measures of a successful search session, are included. The evidence is fairly definitive, there can be little doubt that Google uses clicks and post-click behavior as part of its ranking algorithms.</span></p></div></div>

Why did I lose traffic for a certain subdirectory?</span></p><p><span>Panda was released under Amit Singhal’s direction. Singhal was decidedly against machine learning due to its limited observability. In fact, there are a series of patents focusing on site quality for Panda, but the one I want to focus on is the non-descript&nbsp; </span><a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US8682892B1/en"><span>“Ranking search results.”</span></a><span> The patent clarifies that Panda is far simpler than what we thought. It was a largely about building a scoring modifier based on distributed signals related to user behavior and external links. That modifier can be applied on a domain level, subdomain, or subdirectory level.&nbsp;</span></p></div></div>

<div data-id="64e7882" data-element_type="section" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><p><span>The independent links are basically what we think of as linking root domains, but the reference queries are a bit more involved. Here’s how they are defined in the patent:</span></p></div>

Specifically, he was not wrong about the conclusions from his click experiments, his repeated attempts to show the existence of a Google Sandbox, his case studies showing Google ranks subdomains differently, and his long-belittled belief that Google employs sitewide, authority-style signals.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div><p>There are few things I think about more than the essays on
<a href="https://gwern.net/index">gwern.net</a>,
and there are few with as satisfying a theoretical payout
to contemplate in my orb as
<a href="https://gwern.net/note/pipeline">his essay on “leaky pipelines”</a>,
aka log-normal distributions.</p><p>The skulk: Say you’re working on a Laravel web app.
You’re about 90% sure you know how to start the app. You’re
80% sure you know how to handle the infra you’ll need to
get it online. And you’re 70% sure you know how to get your
first customer. What is your chance of successfully going
from zero to first customer? 0.9 * 0.8 * 0.7 = a little over
0.5. That’s … a lot less encouraging than any of the
previous numbers, if you buy my multi-step modelling.</p><p>Software estimation is such a mess in part because
it has trouble recognizing that, at least,
<a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2010/03/03/just-in-case-versus-just-in-time/">just-in-time</a>
learning is at least <em>non-normally distributed</em>.
Everything we know about traditional project management,
from Waterfall to Gantt charts to estimation practices,
are on some level based around the idea that each individual
step in the chain is bell-shaped: A process taking twice as
long as it normally does might be 2 standard deviations out,
aka in the bottom 2.5% of outcomes. But in a log-normal
distribution, processes taking two, three, or five times as
long are much more common, and this throws things into
disarray. Some things happen much faster than usual - but
doing one estimated week-long project in half the time,
and another estimated week-long project in twice the time,
still leaves you in the red for your time budget.</p><p>Needless to say, it is almost never the case that in
software development you know all or even most of the
technical hurdles you will face in the processs of development.
An
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient-market_hypothesis">efficient markets hypothesis</a>
fanboy might say “If anyone already knew how to do it, it would
already be done by now”. I’m not that optimistic, but
I do think this leaky-pipeline approach can shed light
on some more counterintuitive things about our industry.</p><p>Such as the relentless emphasis, not only on relevant experience,
but on <em>knowing your specific tooling</em> when you apply to a given
job. You and I might be hardcore enough computer geeks that we
can pick up any language and be productive in it within a few
weeks, but if that doesn’t hold for the <em>median</em> software
developer, then employers really are justified in deciding that
e.g. they only want to hire Java devs with previous experience
in… Java. If there’s a 20% chance it takes 1 month, 20% for
2 months, … 20% for 5 months before your non-Java-background
Java dev has enough experience to finally start contributing
to the Java codebase, then yeah, it makes a lot of sense not
to want to gamble on that. Not only do you face the possibility
of paying a five- or six-figure sum for someone who’s useless,
you have very little ability to estimate as an employer
yourself when they will become useful.</p><p>Now what’s really interesting about this theory is that
it suggests that <strong>business processes that are normally-distributed
are the exception, not the norm</strong>, in a sense.
<em>Every</em> new process a person has to undertake will have at
least some phase which is dominated by learning. That’s as
true of web dev as it is of learning to operate the drive-thru
at McDonald’s. It takes a special kind of rigor to transform
that into an activity routine and repeatable enough that you
get a long tail of normally-distributed, profitable activity.
Again, this makes sense: I’ve been building Django and Hugo
websites and web apps for a few years now, and I’ve been using
Python much longer than that, and I sort of have an intuitive
sense by now for how long either of them would take me.
That’s not because I’m some genius savant - it’s because I have
already flowed through the leaky pipeline enough times
to know how I like to approach most things. The instant I’m
in new territory, we’re back to the leaky pipeline.</p><p>It may be the case that academic,
<a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2010/03/03/just-in-case-versus-just-in-time/">just-in-case</a>
learning is less this way, because
the actual things you need to learn is carefully plotted
ahead of time for you. This would explain the popularity of
tutorials online, as ways to tamp down on the worst-case
scenario where that thing you thought would take you a week
to do ends up taking you a year. That being said, I definitely
had some classes in college that unexpectedly took way less
time to me (wireless communication, DSP) and some that
unexpectedly took way more (Maxwellian electromagnetism).</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

            <span>Abstract:</span>The poor performance of transformers on arithmetic tasks seems to stem in large part from their inability to keep track of the exact position of each digit inside of a large span of digits. We mend this problem by adding an embedding to each digit that encodes its position relative to the start of the number. In addition to the boost these embeddings provide on their own, we show that this fix enables architectural modifications such as input injection and recurrent layers to improve performance even further.
<br>With positions resolved, we can study the logical extrapolation ability of transformers. Can they solve arithmetic problems that are larger and more complex than those in their training data? We find that training on only 20 digit numbers with a single GPU for one day, we can reach state-of-the-art performance, achieving up to 99% accuracy on 100 digit addition problems. Finally, we show that these gains in numeracy also unlock improvements on other multi-step reasoning tasks including sorting and multiplication.

It's the Memorial Day holiday weekend and it's time for a little deferred maintenance, especially on those machines I intend to work on more in the near future. So we'll start with one that's widely considered to be a remarkable cul-de-sac in computing history: the Canon Cat.

</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEigCC9Ur4NkrG1rdaNqtJ_ymCPmwJsKAtjybV7vRshVQrF7vlqqby6As4zRdq-QwXfaZI6k0gCCNj6FRLR18vkbHDTth90qvVYgX7JD9kxKws0U7_SBcJUTiYL5IaLCJZh7RKgiHMUrHQB61JOIMbtdHOD-2gNlwgnVGgksNd1fuoP7Bh64ulpL7xTi-n4/s3675/cat-m.jpg"><img alt="" data-original-height="2500" data-original-width="3675" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEigCC9Ur4NkrG1rdaNqtJ_ymCPmwJsKAtjybV7vRshVQrF7vlqqby6As4zRdq-QwXfaZI6k0gCCNj6FRLR18vkbHDTth90qvVYgX7JD9kxKws0U7_SBcJUTiYL5IaLCJZh7RKgiHMUrHQB61JOIMbtdHOD-2gNlwgnVGgksNd1fuoP7Bh64ulpL7xTi-n4/s320/cat-m.jpg" width="320"></a></p><p>

Many people take a casual glance at this machine and say, "Isn't that an overgrown word processor?" And one could certainly think so, in part because of its keyboard-centric operation, but mostly from the utterly uncomprehending way Canon advertised it in 1987. Canon dubbed the Cat a "<em>work</em> processor" because of its built-in telecommunications, modem and word processor even though Jef Raskin, its designer, had intended it as a "people's computer" that could be inexpensive, accessible and fully functional — all things he had hoped to accomplish at Apple after first launching the Macintosh project, prior to departing in 1982.
</p><p>
Canon, however, never fully grasped the concept either. Apart from the tone-deaf marketing, Canon sold the device through their typewriter division and required the display to only show what a daisywheel printer could generate, limiting its potential as a general purpose workstation. There was also an infamous story where Canon engineers added a hard power switch not present in the original prototype, believing its absence to be an oversight — over Raskin's objections, who intended the machine as an always-on, instantly useable system.<!-- The Humane Interface p.50--> The Cat nevertheless launched at an MSRP of $1495 ($4125 in 2024 dollars) in July that year to many plaudits and design awards, but alleged corporate shenanigans and uncertainty within Canon doomed it internally, causing them to dropkick the product after just six months and 20,000 sales. In the wake of the 1987 Black Monday stock market crash Raskin's investors subsequently pulled the plug and the company closed in 1991.<!-- SOS 1175311-->

But what was actually under the hood was a unique all-in-one 68000 system with a bitmapped display and a full Forth environment hidden in its ROM-based, fast-start operating system. There's no hard disk, just a single 3.5" floppy drive to save your documents and the current Forth dictionary. Although the default mode is the built-in word processor, its tForth ("token-threaded Forth") dialect was easily unlockable and Information Appliance, Inc., Raskin's company that produced the Cat and licensed it to Canon, published substantial documentation on how to enable and program in it.
</p><p>
We'll have more to say about that <a href="http://oldvcr.blogspot.com/search/label/canon">in a future entry</a> when we get into the guts of the OS. Today, we have two tasks: replace its settings battery and shore up the nearly unobtainium custom Canon floppy drive, its most common point of failure. It's time for a Refurb Weekend.
</p><p>
<a name="more"></a>
Before we begin the job, let's have a little tour. The Cat's notability is such that there are <a href="http://www.canoncat.net/cat/Cat%20Work%20Processor.pdf">many analyses of it</a> (PDF), including Raskin's own musings in <i>The Humane Machine</i>, and I probably couldn't do justice to it in this particular article. But a brief historical digression is always in order around these parts.
</p><p>
After Raskin left Apple in 1982, he took his ideas and founded Information Appliance, Inc. in Palo Alto later that year.<!-- SOS 1175311--> "By choosing to focus on computers rather than the tasks we wanted done, we inherited much of the baggage that had accumulated around earlier generations of computers," Raskin wrote in 1986. "It is more a matter of style and operating systems that need elaborate user interfaces to support huge application programs." He envisioned an environment that provided word processing, information retrieval (i.e., search), programming and telecommunications in a single integrated package — it would do the basic tasks you need and be expandable to the later ones you'd want. This concept was first formalized as the original Swyft project. <a href="https://www.digibarn.com/collections/systems/swyft/index.html">Swyft started</a> as a 6502-based platform which quickly evolved into <a href="https://forum.vcfed.org/index.php?threads/prototype-to-the-canon-cat-the-swyft.12225/#post-174905">a system not unlike the released Cat</a> except for using a 68008 CPU (i.e., a 68000 with an 8-bit data bus and a 1MB addressing range). However, IAI's investors were concerned that its development was taking too long and prevailed upon Raskin's team to commercially surface the technology earlier.

</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi75oKECaw3Us1Qo6nTMCjSITSmjvqsP1pcMHC_dl3xD2ibV0vjcHxE_nvxUO0SMRaW3XCojCbhGK5zOenPxlGQqQilShg1byCrK8uib93jq-MtdY4Si5DSrUzpw6r_anrhuIgZlTjbFBNj7peBzSbxmP0so0n-GUGh51pUkP-AKpyAARf6Z7N6MuH8TU0/s3300/swyft.png"><img alt="" data-original-height="3300" data-original-width="2550" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi75oKECaw3Us1Qo6nTMCjSITSmjvqsP1pcMHC_dl3xD2ibV0vjcHxE_nvxUO0SMRaW3XCojCbhGK5zOenPxlGQqQilShg1byCrK8uib93jq-MtdY4Si5DSrUzpw6r_anrhuIgZlTjbFBNj7peBzSbxmP0so0n-GUGh51pUkP-AKpyAARf6Z7N6MuH8TU0/s320/swyft.png"></a></p><p>

Thus was developed the SwyftCard, a port of the Swyft's software on a 16K EPROM and some glue logic for bankswitching that went in slot 3 of the Apple IIe. Its sole function was to instantly start the environment when the machine was powered on (no need for booting off floppy). 40K of the IIe's 64K was available as the user's workspace, which was loaded at the start of a session and written out at the end of it. The SwyftCard did not interfere with booting most regular Apple II software and could bank itself out without needing to physically remove the card.
</p><p>
Like the Swyft, the SwyftCard came up in a word processor mode as its default interface in which you could immediately type and print text. The workspace stored everything centrally: data from any source, even serial telecommunications such as a modem call, went right into the document too (you could even dial up a Swyft system if it had an auto-answer modem and send it text remotely). The workspace was one big document, subdivided into smaller ones which could be printed, edited or erased individually — which is to say, there was no file system at all. To switch workspaces, you just switched floppies, and the software kept track of whether the current document workspace matched the disk in the drive. The Swyft's most notable innovation was the concept of "leaping," where you held a "leap" key down and typed in the phrase you were looking for, and special attention was paid to making this unique means of workspace navigation as fast as possible. For the SwyftCard, this was implemented with the two Apple keys.
</p><p>
Porting from the Swyft was relatively straightforward since much of the high-level operating system was written in Forth, a language well-established on the 6502 as well, though the 6502's smaller 64K addressing space mandated using the banking logic on the card for memory management. However, a notable difference from Swyft was that SwyftCard users programmed it in good old Applesoft BASIC. You could type a BASIC program directly into the editor, highlight it, and then have it execute — and the output went into your document. This was an easy way to do calculations, for example, but most any appropriate BASIC operation would work such as string variables for templates and frequently used text. IAI offered the entire package in 1985 for $89.95 (in 2024 about $260) with the SwyftCard, a tutorial disk and a ProDOS interchange utility, and won strong reviews from Apple II magazines at the time. David Thornburg wrote in <i>A+</i> that "[i]t not only outperforms any Apple II word-processing system, but it also lets the Apple //e outperform the Macintosh."
</p><p>
While the Cat was reportedly developed on time and on budget, IAI's investors remained unhappy with its gestational pace, and refused to invest sufficient capital to allow IAI to sell it under its own name. This forced IAI management to find a willing licensee for the product, and they found it in Japanese electronics manufacturer Canon, who was looking for another way to crack the microcomputer market after years of repeated failures. Raskin's original target price point was $795, but this was again vetoed and the higher price instituted for better margins. Internally the machine is called the Canon V777.

Here's the default editor. The Cat inherits the same interface as the Swyft (and, by descent, the SwyftCard). What's most noticeable is what's not visible: other than a small section at the bottom showing document settings, margins and a free memory gauge, there are no windows or menus of any kind. There's a cursor, but no pointer.

In fact, there aren't even conventional cursor keys. The Cat has the same "leap" keys as the Swyft and SwyftCard, in a bright but tasteful pink, and they work the same way to jump to portions of the document or into other documents. You can also use them to scroll with the SHIFT key, or move by single letters, sentences or paragraphs. The LEAP keys are also how you highlight text blocks to manipulate by LEAPing to the beginning, LEAPing to the end, and then pressing them together.

Much, but not all, of the rest of the interface is exposed on blue labels on the front of the keys. These are accessed by USE FRONT, which is basically the Cat's Command key, and even the LEAP keys have special functions with USE FRONT. For some operations you'll keep USE FRONT and other keys down and add others into chords. Raskin was emphatic that the Swyft and Cat should not have modes — when you release the keys, the operation is over, whatever that ends up meaning.

For everything else, there's built-in online help with the EXPLAIN key combination (USE FRONT+N). Besides on-demand assistance, the EXPLAIN facility also serves as the "error centre." If the Cat hits an error, you don't get a modal dialogue; instead, it just politely beeps. You can then ask it to explain itself and it will give its objections in prose.

As the Swyft and Cat were independent systems (unlike the SwyftCard), they're Forth through and through, and via a hidden setting you can program in it (or in 68000 assembly). Like most Forth environments of the day, Forth didn't run under an operating system; Forth <em>was</em> the operating system. The particular dialect on the Cat is tForth, for "token-threaded" Forth, which instead of storing direct execution addresses for each instruction in a Forth word executes using smaller tokens which are looked up instead. This exchanges the cost of an indirect lookup in a table for substantially greater code density.
</p><p>
Canon did not mention its programming capability in their user documentation, but IAI discussed it at length in their own documents, as the "secret" programmer's setting was never intended to be truly secret. When Forth is enabled, you can either type in Forth words at a traditional <tt>ok</tt> prompt, or you can type Forth code into your document, highlight it and execute it (USE FRONT+ANSWER). When running code this way, any output appears in your document.

The Cat also featured a reasonable amount of I/O. There's a DB-25 RS-232 port, RJ-11 jacks for modem and phone handset (optional), a Centronics-style printer port and a small recessed push button switch which starts diagnostics if depressed (with a pin or some such) at power on.
</p><p>
I'll have a lot more to say about Forth and the Cat's operating system in <a href="http://oldvcr.blogspot.com/search/label/canon">the upcoming entry</a>. Let's get inside.

The logic board sits in a "pan" on the underside. Undo the screws (except for the ones in the feet).

The pan is now loose. With a little gentle tugging with a nylon spudger or some such, you should be able to free the lip on the side <em>opposite</em> the rear ports and get it lifted up slightly.

Doing so carefully because there are still cables attached, slide the ports out from their openings on the back.

The logic board is attached to the top case by three cables: a white flat ribbon to the keyboard, a 20-pin ribbon to the floppy disk, and power and video lines to the CRT. Gently pull out the end of the white ribbon from the keyboard. You should be able to get enough play in the floppy disk and power cables to pull the board up and to the side. We're going to pull off those cables shortly but if you're just replacing the battery for the settings RAM, you only need to disconnect the keyboard.

Lay the logic board flat and remove the screws holding the Faraday cage on. If you have chosen not to disconnect the other two cables then you can't remove the cage completely, but with care you'll be able to elevate and rotate it enough for the next step.

The logic board. For some reason some of the silkscreened board identifiers on this unit were blacked out with a marker (I didn't do that). The rear ports in this view are west (left). In addition to the serial, printer and phone ports, there is a small switch SW1 not accessible from the rear panel with "T"erminal and "H"ost settings for the serial port; it should normally be set to "H"ost.
</p><p>
The Cat uses a full 68000 instead of the 68008 of the Swyft (at IC1), which also makes it faster. The 256K system ROM is provided as four 64K EPROMs with coloured labels interleaved to yield the standard 68K big-endian 32-bit long. The 128K ROM at IC6 south of (under) the coloured EPROMs is the spellcheck dictionary, referred to as the SV-ROM. This is the USA/Japan chip; other locales may be at any position of IC6, IC7 or IC8.
</p><p>
In the northeast (top right) corner is the RAM, each one a Fujitsu MB81464 32K (256Kbit) 150ns DRAM chip, used both as the system memory and partially as the frame buffer. This unit has the default 256K of RAM (eight), with sockets to add another 128K to equal 384K. An upgrade to do some other time. It should be possible to populate the other unsocketed row as well but I'd prefer not to solder on a rare system if I can avoid it.
</p><p>
The show is primarily run by three custom Canon gate arrays at IC30 (NH4-5001, GA#1), IC13 (NH4-5002, GA#2) and IC31 (NH4-5003, GA#3). GA#1 controls the main system oscillator X1, a "20MHz" (actually 19.968MHz) crystal used directly for RAS, CAS and the video data shift clock, which it divides by four for the CPU's "5MHz" (actually 4.992MHz) clock, and also generates the horizontal and vertical video sync for the CRT. It handles fetching video data from shared RAM which is fed into GA#2. GA#2 actually emits the pixels to the monitor, as well as handling the watchdog timer (if the CPU doesn't regularly reset this timer, GA#2 will pass it an NMI, and then reset it if necessary), sending the regular keystrobe interrupt (via the 68681 DUART at IC34), and controlling the modem off-hook status. GA#3 handles the printer, keyboard and floppy drive.
</p><p>
The Motorola MC68681P DUART is a two-port UART. One port handles serial communications from the internal modem and the other port handles either the external RS-232 or the printer port, as configured. It also manages the beeper at "BZ" and is a source of two IRQs, the keystrobe interrupt from GA#2 (keyscan is done every 6.5ms), and when a telephone ring is detected by the modem. It takes a 3.6864MHz clock provided by GA#1; earlier board revisions had a discrete crystal for this located where the large trace is northeast of the DUART.
</p><p>
The modem hardware is logically in the southwest (bottom left) corner, closest to the phone jacks. The major chips here are the AMI S35213 at IC37, a Bell 212A 300/1200bps modem-on-a-chip, an AMI S2579 DTMF touch tone generator at IC40 and the AMI S35212A Bell 212/V.22 modem filter at IC38. The S35213 is clocked by the 2.4576MHz crystal at X3 and the S2579 is clocked by the 3.579545MHz crystal at X4. The modem feeds into the DUART.
</p><p>
The "ROM" at IC11 is actually an 8K 150ns static RAM, an NEC D4364C with specific support for battery backup. The service manual calls this the SV-RAM. This is what the CR2032 battery powers at the southeast (lower right) corner. It's dead, of course, so with a little gentle levering we pop it out with the nylon spudger and replace it.

To get into the top case, we'll now need to free the CPU board from the other two connectors, so once we've replaced the battery and put back on the Faraday cage, we'll disconnect the mainboard completely. These connectors, fortunately, are keyed.

Now to get at the floppy drive. We remove two screws from the back and two screws under the handle, and pull the back cover off.

This exposes the rear of the CRT cage and the power supply. The rear of the floppy drive is on the left in this view.

The floppy drive bracket is secured to the side of the CRT cage with four mounting screws. If you have a slim enough 90-degree screwdriver, you <em>might</em> be able to just get the floppy drive unscrewed directly. Mine isn't thin enough, so I had to take out the bracket first.

The bracket is secured in three locations like a triangle. This is the triangle's "apex." In this view, it is the bottommost screw sitting on that tab. It was very difficult to extract, very easy to strip and just as hard to tighten. You may have to work on it for awhile to get it and the tab it's bolting to the CRT cage free.

The other two are easier. They are the two screws on either side of the bracket's tab (not the third, lower one on the right). You've already disconnected the floppy drive by unplugging it from the motherboard, so the bracket can come straight out. Unscrew those four mounting screws on the bracket and pull out the floppy drive.

There it is, the notorious Canon MD-3301. Just leave the cable connected. This is a custom drive by Canon known only to have been used in the Cat. It has a 20-pin interface instead of the regular 34-pin PC floppy interface, though with some logic and cabling it is possible to use a regular PC 3.5" floppy disk in it.
</p><p>
This drive fortunately still works, so what we're going to do next is a little preventive maintenance (other than the usual inspection, cleaning, etc.).

</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgIc_MnNqazcm2zMeGO1xHFEypV1TMRjbzFpBfe8svE3nvGxBMY6OLRF2nY-J63fuFJ8RxzOatPxCg1DfxOFpQ0RFa5F3O2uzM6QXvLqhbV2xEH0lG3EpnR9Pv4t8BoNIov3ygIB_sp-HjdS4u7VCwCqNgSsnX3-JP0wF7o9FLcdQqanH-ErzzdKYuM3hA/s4080/PXL_20240524_214708102.jpg"><img alt="" data-original-height="3072" data-original-width="4080" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgIc_MnNqazcm2zMeGO1xHFEypV1TMRjbzFpBfe8svE3nvGxBMY6OLRF2nY-J63fuFJ8RxzOatPxCg1DfxOFpQ0RFa5F3O2uzM6QXvLqhbV2xEH0lG3EpnR9Pv4t8BoNIov3ygIB_sp-HjdS4u7VCwCqNgSsnX3-JP0wF7o9FLcdQqanH-ErzzdKYuM3hA/s320/PXL_20240524_214708102.jpg" width="320"></a></p><p>

There are two tiny little screws on each side holding on the metal cover. Once removed, this side goes <em>down</em> to take the cover off.

I'm fortunate to have a drive still in very good condition. A close inspection showed no obvious damage.

</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiajDBTLtT0tMn1PqVK0IFGfa9I-VA8Ewm29i_7ZjiXEne82jsPjhfKk-uGlFGjtPubVGVIXzMEJfQUKlEMleyoSNfMCQNMViGeDzOqWCG-XPQ_R-_3nNtCzN3rwxG82K1OrlaNd_M8XjXznPpfyqQLIDRsrx_NKuMqavEmgJtzTwqDLulidCV6ptlSsNc/s4080/PXL_20240524_215515804.jpg"><img alt="" data-original-height="3072" data-original-width="4080" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiajDBTLtT0tMn1PqVK0IFGfa9I-VA8Ewm29i_7ZjiXEne82jsPjhfKk-uGlFGjtPubVGVIXzMEJfQUKlEMleyoSNfMCQNMViGeDzOqWCG-XPQ_R-_3nNtCzN3rwxG82K1OrlaNd_M8XjXznPpfyqQLIDRsrx_NKuMqavEmgJtzTwqDLulidCV6ptlSsNc/s320/PXL_20240524_215515804.jpg" width="320"></a></p><p>

The problem that occurs with this drive has to do with the head's guide rail. (This part is with thanks to Dwight Elvey, the unofficial "godfather" of the Canon Cat.) In this view the head is the white square with the black line through the middle, and the rail it rides on is the metal post to the east (right) of it. This is a 2x enlargement, so the head is actually a fairly small part.

</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEilwNn6gvyPHJB37iUUZJDE8GfyedrJUjeh53oZDMMRt2cCG6Yd8rzP1q1yHQLLrpu8eXQ8o5v18ZHtF6m4vEpCMawcC3eq2YAKyklMLCCS55i_7tX11Qt-1Rc5gon_uzqwG9qJRvi7rCGK-pH_LmCyVC_f9KykuzZy4Rbck-XaMPtCOyro8PWUU8VJnJk/s4080/PXL_20240524_215429360.jpg"><img alt="" data-original-height="4080" data-original-width="3072" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEilwNn6gvyPHJB37iUUZJDE8GfyedrJUjeh53oZDMMRt2cCG6Yd8rzP1q1yHQLLrpu8eXQ8o5v18ZHtF6m4vEpCMawcC3eq2YAKyklMLCCS55i_7tX11Qt-1Rc5gon_uzqwG9qJRvi7rCGK-pH_LmCyVC_f9KykuzZy4Rbck-XaMPtCOyro8PWUU8VJnJk/s320/PXL_20240524_215429360.jpg"></a></p><p>

The guide rail extends towards the back of the unit where the cable is. If you draw an imaginary line between the silkscreened backwards "20" and "21" digits on the PCB, you can see the other end of that same rod. This photo is 1x, so you're looking for a relatively thin cylinder.
</p><p>
Along that rod are two white nylon pieces secured by screws. These nylon tabs, in particular the rearmost, serve to clamp down the rod so it can't pop up. These tabs here are luckily in excellent condition, but that isn't the case for many Cat drives where the nylon has degenerated with age. When both tabs either crack or loosen, the rod is no longer held in. Ejecting a disk, even gently, could now cause the head to tilt into the open metal window of the floppy disk and get stuck. Should that happen and you innocently attempt to remove the floppy, you might accidentally end up pulling the head off. Doing so is catastrophic and would be extremely difficult to repair.
</p><p>
There are several strategies for dealing with this problem. While the middle tab is subject to the same age-related breakdown as the rearmost tab, the drive can survive the middle tab failing as long as the rearmost one is still intact. Unfortunately, the rearmost tab is correspondingly the one under the most mechanical stress. Here, both tabs are in very good shape, so we're going to concentrate on the rear tab, though what you do to the rear tab could also be done to the middle one.
</p><p>
If the nylon tabs are still holding, then you could reinforce them with something like a very small layer of JBWeld (other kinds of epoxy may not be strong enough), though this is fiddly and you'd better not get the goop anywhere else in the drive. It should also be possible to fashion a similar plastic piece of similar thickness. I don't know if a 3D printed one would have enough strength, so you might consider starting with a solid piece of good quality high-strength polymer and shaving and drilling it to fit.

Or you can do what Canon probably should have done in the first place and back it up with metal. I went to Home Despot and bought a roll of 28-gauge galvanized steel pipe hanger tape which at 0.015" thick (0.38mm) is still thin enough to fit on top of the piece. (It also gave me an excuse to use those metal snips I bought that were just sitting around.)

</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgHG2htQwngP5mNME-LtsE4UicrcNwz0_rNOsUdQljSpItMGRKngC-qBtAwZD57Te_wZWrP4IltaoTkkyXwdzLkU2Tx6msI0dmB1dxQjFOxEloxsWinu1vGqCs4MUZ30d_jdB2nOYZvpw4uxGaVh4et5gK1Y_8CwBKj3duIXSf9OPaDhei1cgBghOr7hhw/s4080/PXL_20240524_215712150.jpg"><img alt="" data-original-height="4080" data-original-width="3072" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgHG2htQwngP5mNME-LtsE4UicrcNwz0_rNOsUdQljSpItMGRKngC-qBtAwZD57Te_wZWrP4IltaoTkkyXwdzLkU2Tx6msI0dmB1dxQjFOxEloxsWinu1vGqCs4MUZ30d_jdB2nOYZvpw4uxGaVh4et5gK1Y_8CwBKj3duIXSf9OPaDhei1cgBghOr7hhw/s320/PXL_20240524_215712150.jpg"></a></p><p>

The nice thing about this particular type of pipe hanger strap (Oatey #33526) is that it has a pre-drilled hole of just about the right size. We'll get out the snips and trim it down.

Secured in position. The screw is not very long, so you can't use a very thick piece of metal here, but there was still enough room to get it attached firmly. I inserted a disk and checked that it fed in and the head stayed clear when it ejected.

Now with the machine reassembled and ready to go, it's time to get into <a href="http://oldvcr.blogspot.com/search/label/canon">that project I've been meaning to</a>. It boots now, so I'll just leave you with this teaser since I've made some progress on it already:

IAI developed one additional Swyft-family unit, the prototype Swyft Model III. This was supposed to be a portable unit with an external floppy drive, a 640x200 supertwist LCD, 512K of RAM and a 2400bps internal modem. Since it had no hard disk or internal floppy drive, battery life was reputed to be six hours with 8 AA NiCads (longer with alkalines), though the processor wasn't specified. It was never released before IAI closed its doors. While Raskin retained the patents and even tried resurrecting the concept in software with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080119202912/http://rchi.raskincenter.org/index.php?title=Home">the Archy environment</a>, no one ever developed a full system like it again. Raskin <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/28/business/jef-raskin-61-developer-of-apple-macintosh-is-dead.html">died of pancreatic cancer in 2005</a> at the age of 61.

			<p><span>T</span>he act of naming is always a form of propaganda. When you name something, you are never perfectly describing what it is, but are instead influencing how it is perceived.</p>
<p>Marketers know this better than anyone. Prior to 1977, there was no such thing as the Chilean sea bass; the fish was called, instead, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patagonian_toothfish">the Pata­gonian toothfish</a>. The Chilean sea bass <a href="https://priceonomics.com/the-invention-of-the-chilean-sea-bass/">isn’t a type of bass at all</a>, and most of them do not come from Chile. It was purely a marketing invention: an entrepreneur named Lee Lantz intuited that the American market might enjoy the <em>taste</em> of the Patagonian toothfish, but would never buy it under its given name. First, he chose to falsely call it a “bass” because Americans were comfortable with that type of fish. He then rejected the names “Pacific sea bass” and “South American sea bass,” on the grounds that they were too generic, and eventually settled on “Chilean sea bass” as a more exotic alternative.</p>
<p>The name of one of the most popular fish in the world therefore has nothing to do with what the fish really is. A type of cod that is primarily farmed near Antarctica became the Chilean sea bass as a Goldilocks branding compromise. The familiarity of the bass was married to the perceived exoticism of Chile so that an American entrepreneur could sell a fish nobody had ever heard of to high-end restaurants in the United States. This ploy worked so well that today nobody has ever heard of the Patagonian toothfish, while the Chilean sea bass has a secure and inalienable position on restaurant menus from sea to shining sea.</p>
<p>So its name is propaganda, but nobody cares. A lie that makes money will always be preferable to a truth that does not. Once you realize that <em>every name is propaganda</em>, it becomes readily apparent how much misconduct, greed, and corruption can be concealed behind an innocuously disingenuous name, especially a name that successfully evokes positive emotions in the general public.</p>
<p>Consider the word “nonprofit.” Whoever came up with the idea of calling these organizations “nonprofits” was a marketing genius on the level of Steve Jobs. When someone hears the word nonprofit, they assume that such an organization is working for the public good; that it serves the homeless, protects the weak, exists for the benefit and the betterment of society at large. Hearing that something is a “nonprofit” immediately gives a sense that the organization is trustworthy and the people running it are driven by a charitable agenda. It’s a word that shuts down the critical faculties and grants an instantaneous moral stature to any organization to which it is applied. Consequently, non­profits receive a benefit of the doubt that would not be granted to any other form of private corporation.</p>
<p>Yet nonprofit organizations are frequently the exact opposite of what they appear to be. As a consequence of the benefit of the doubt provided to nonprofits, there is rarely enough oversight to guarantee that they are doing what we pay them to do. In some cities, upwards of a billion dollars of public funds are paid to nonprofit organizations every year with glaringly insufficient safeguards to ensure that the money is used in a manner likely to serve the public interest.</p>
<p>This money is then spent in ways that would shock the taxpayers whose hard-earned dollars are being effectively stolen from them. Non­profits that self-righteously declare themselves providers of homeless services actively lobby to make homelessness worse in order to increase their own funding; nonprofit organizations hire convicted <span>felons—including</span> murderers, gang leaders, sex offenders, and <span>rapists—who</span> go on to commit more felonies while receiving hundreds of thousands of dollars in government contracts; and the executives of nonprofits, the very people in charge of institutions whose stated purpose is not to make money, earn millions of dollars while catastrophically failing to deliver the public services we are paying them to provide.</p>
<p>And as all of that is going on, the nonprofits in question receive tax breaks from the IRS, ensuring that the incompetent organizations wors­ening your city’s homelessness crisis exert their corrupting influence all the way to the halls of power in Washington, D.C.</p>
<h3><span><strong>Money for Nothing</strong></span></h3>
<p>There is a notorious nonprofit in San Francisco called the Tenants and Owners Development Corporation, or <span>todco</span> for short. The Tenants and Owners Development Corporation, despite containing the word “development” in its name, has not developed a single property <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/sf/article/He-s-been-blamed-for-killing-housing-but-16630332.php">in approximately twenty years</a>. More and more, <span>todco</span> isn’t spending its money to help its current tenants, either. The <em>San Francisco Standard</em> found that <span>todco</span>’s spending on resident services declined from 62 percent of revenue in 2012 <a href="https://sfstandard.com/2023/03/09/sf-housing-nonprofit-todco-politics-tenants-infestations-drug-overdose/">to only 45 percent eight years later</a>. The Standard interviewed tenants in one of <span>todco</span>’s buildings and was deluged with complaints about decaying accommodations and rodent infestations. A woman told them bluntly that there were rats in the walls and complaints to management went nowhere; the tap water tasted foul and she sometimes found roaches in her food. One man felt a bite on his neck and assumed at first that he’d been bitten by one of the multitude of vermin that crawled through the building’s light fixtures; in fact, he’d been accidentally shot and the bullet hole was still visible in his wall when reporters interviewed him several months after the fact.</p>
<p>It turned out that instead of spending money on housing development and tenant support, <span>todco</span> boosted executive pay and funneled millions into lobbying. As <span>todco</span>’s spending on its tenants declined by 17 percentage points, executive pay quadrupled. Meanwhile, <span>todco</span>’s president, John Elberling, launched the Yerba Buena Neighborhood Consortium, a political lobbying organization. Between 2012 and 2020, <span>todco</span>’s direct lobbying of legislative bodies increased <em>95 times</em>, from $5,000 to $470,000. The Yerba Buena Neighborhood Consortium spent another $1.35 million on ballot referenda between 2016 and 2021, and within the small pond of municipal politics, that much money, if strategically deployed, can buy a shocking amount of influence.</p>
<p>Here’s where the story gets strange. Although <span>todco</span>’s nonprofit status is predicated on helping poor people afford housing, <span>todco</span> lobbies incessantly to prevent the construction of affordable units in some of San Francisco’s most expensive neighborhoods. In 2018, <span>todco</span> sued to prevent the construction of a mixed-use building on the grounds <a href="https://sfstandard.com/2023/03/09/sf-housing-nonprofit-todco-politics-tenants-infestations-drug-overdose/">that it would cast “new shadows”</a> on a community garden; <span>todco</span> then agreed to drop this lawsuit after the building’s developer paid them $98,000, raising questions as to whether <span>todco</span> was merely using San Francisco’s byzantine permitting process to extract a bribe from another developer. In another case, <span>todco</span> lobbied to block a <a href="https://sfstandard.com/2021/10/28/supervisors-under-fire-vote-against-proposed-soma-apartment-building-sparks-furor-may-violate-state-law/">495-unit housing development</a> that would have included over a hundred affordable units. In other words, an affordable housing nonprofit has repeatedly sued other developers to prevent the construction of the same affordable units that it is supposed to be working to provide.</p>
<p>And then, in July of 2020, the strangest of <span>todco</span>’s fiascos took place. That year, <span>todco</span>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/sf/bayarea/heatherknight/article/san-francisco-housing-17408816.php">prevented the construction</a> of over one thousand new apartments, including 350 affordable units, so it could run a “racial equity study,” which it then never bothered to conduct. San Francisco Supervisor Dean <span>Preston—a</span> <span>todco</span> political <span>ally—convinced</span> the land use committee to put off the development for six months, during which time <span>todco</span> would supposedly analyze the development’s impact on minority residents in the neighborhood.</p>
<p>By August 2022, <span>todco</span> had not even begun the study that was supposed to have been completed eighteen months earlier. When asked by reporters from the <em>San Francisco Chronicle</em> why the study had never been done, <span>todco</span>’s president told the <em>Chronicle</em> that Covid interfered with their plans and a consulting group they’d been relying on had dropped out. Both of these excuses are highly dubious. When <span>todco</span> lobbied to delay the housing development so it could run its mythic study, Covid had already been rampaging through the United States for six months, meaning that <span>todco</span> was not blindsided by Covid and cannot use it as an excuse for failure. Furthermore, one consulting group dropping out should not indefinitely delay a study when the organization running it has millions of dollars in annual revenue, tens of millions of dollars in total assets, and a bevy of political connections. If <span>todco</span> wanted to run the study they could have done so, but they have exhibited no sense of urgency despite the fact that their failure to conduct the promised study has indefinitely prevented the existence of 350 units of affordable housing.</p>
<p><span>Todco</span> is a nonprofit whose mandate is to provide affordable housing. Over the last twenty years, however, <span>todco</span> has produced no additional units of affordable housing, has allowed the units it already owns to decay, and has spent millions of dollars preventing other developers from building thousands of apartments and hundreds of affordable units. Paradoxically, a nonprofit meant to provide affordable housing is spending taxpayer money to prevent affordable housing from being built; an organization that exists with the explicit mandate to help alleviate San Francisco’s housing crisis is instead working tirelessly to make that crisis worse. How can this be explained?</p>
<p>To understand <span>todco</span>’s behavior, you need to know something about the business model of affordable housing nonprofits. An afford­able housing NGO makes more money as rents rise in the area where its buildings are located. Government subsidies make up the difference between what the NGO’s tenants are paying and what they <em>could be paying</em> if the building charged them the market rate. This means that a nonprofit, despite its name, has the <em>same profit incentive</em> as any other landlord, in that a lack of housing construction increases its profit margins by driving up rents. The only difference is that a nonprofit benefits from high rents through government subsidies instead of from directly charging its tenants.</p>
<p>And that is an obvious conflict of interest. Nonprofit housing providers <em>benefit financially</em> if less housing gets built because high rents increase their subsidies. Affordable housing nonprofits are therefore incentivized to work against housing affordability if they want to increase the amount their executives get paid. Everything <span>todco</span> is doing is a natural consequence of the nonprofit industrial complex. T<span>odco</span>’s subsidies rise in concert with rents; it then funnels the money it receives from the government back into lobbying the same politicians responsible for funding it; those politicians prevent the construction of housing on <span>todco</span>’s behalf, thereby ensuring that rents remain high and <span>todco</span> rakes in millions of additional dollars in government subsidies; and <span>todco</span>’s executives receive enormous boosts to personal compensation and buy million-dollar houses in the suburbs. It is a kickback scheme so ingenious it would make Al Capone green with envy.</p>
<p>This propensity for nonprofits to privilege their own finances over the needs of the poor is not unique to San Francisco. Last year, an initiative to establish a public social housing developer in Seattle <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220713083723/https:/www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/homeless/a-new-tool-or-a-distraction-seattle-social-housing-initiative-faces-early-opposition/">was opposed by the Housing Development Consortium</a>, a lobbying organ­ization for affordable housing nonprofits. The <em>Seattle Times’</em> reporting on this initiative is revealing:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Housing Development Consortium, a lobbying group whose members include King County’s major low-income housing de­velopers, financial institutions and governmental development agencies, <em>doesn’t want to compete with a new organization for funding</em>.</p>
<p>The Housing Development Consortium argues that Seattle should focus its resources on the existing system . . . <em>which in­volves a collaboration between the largely federally funded Seattle Housing Authority, local public development agencies and other nonprofit organizations</em> [emphasis added].</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, a lobbying organization for affordable housing nonprofits advocated against a social housing initiative on the grounds that it would direct funds away from its members. Many of the people involved in these affordable housing nonprofits would describe them­selves as socialists, and yet they argued <em>against</em> a more socialist form of public housing development and in favor of the privatized, complex, and inefficient system that just so happens to financially benefit themselves.</p>
<p>In the event that America tried to dramatically increase the amount of public housing, a policy advocated by many progressives, it is likely that some of the fiercest opponents would be nonprofit landlords who would be outraged at the prospect of direct competition from government-owned housing. This is normal behavior for a private organization that relies on the government as its primary revenue source, but it is directly contrary to what the term “nonprofit” would seem to imply. Despite their trustworthy name, nonprofits are not <span>now—nor</span> have they ever <span>been—the</span> uncorrupted agents of the public good that their defend­ers would have us believe.</p>
<h3><span><strong>Crime Inc.</strong></span></h3>
<p>Exacerbating the profound conflicts of interest created by outsourcing government services to private nonprofits is the near total lack of oversight of these nonprofits, particularly with respect to how their money is spent and whom they hire to provide their services. It is a regular occurrence that money given to nonprofits is misdirected in a way ruinously contrary to the public interest. In especially egregious cases, money given to nonprofits finds its way into the pockets of people who never would have been hired by a government agency due to either a lack of competence or a disqualifying criminal history.</p>
<p>For instance, San Francisco gave tens of millions of dollars to a nonprofit called the United Council of Human Services over the course of two decades; <a href="https://sfstandard.com/2023/02/10/sf-homeless-nonprofit-ceo-lavish-lifestyle-illegal-activity-lawsuit/">their CEO proceeded to spend large sums of money in a totally illegal manner</a>, buying at least five vehicles for herself and family members and driving around with a trunk full of expensive jewelry. She also allowed twenty of her friends, family, and employees to occupy government-subsidized apartments which were meant to be used as housing for low-income San Franciscans.</p>
<p>There is always going to be <em>some</em> level of malfeasance when large sums of money are involved, but what makes the United Council’s criminality inexcusable is that Gwendolyn Westbrook, the CEO who stole taxpayer dollars and spent them on herself, <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/port-official-to-be-arraigned-in-embezzling-3109308.php">pleaded guilty in 1997 to stealing thousands of dollars in parking lot collections</a> while working for the Port of San Francisco. A nonprofit run by a woman with a proven history of stealing from government agencies was given tens of millions of dollars to provide affordable housing services, and San Francisco’s political class was somehow surprised when, true to her previous track record, she stole that money, too.</p>
<p>Following Westbrook’s fall from grace, a <em>San Francisco Standard</em> investigation discovered that the city had paid <a href="https://sfstandard.com/2023/01/12/san-francisco-nonprofits-revoked-suspended-delinquent-millions/">tens of millions of dollars to nonprofits that were ineligible for government funding</a>: $25 million went to charities that were either delinquent or suspended and another $65 million went to nonprofits that were later declared ineligible. At the time of the <em>Standard</em>’s investigation, San Francisco had another $300 million of future contractual obligations to NGOs it was not legally allowed to fund.</p>
<p>Although San Francisco is one of the worst cities when it comes to nonprofits behaving badly, these same problems exist in every city that makes excessive use of the nonprofit sector. Seattle, in particular, has a rather distressing tendency to give exorbitant sums of taxpayer money to convicted felons, up to and including violent criminals and registered sex offenders. In 2001, a man named Khalid Adams was convicted of first degree theft in an incident in which he allegedly <a href="https://archive.seattletimes.com/archive/?date=20010329&amp;slug=mardigras29m1">groped his victim while shouting racial slurs</a>; two years later Adams was convicted again, this time of first degree robbery and unlawful possession of a firearm. Adams’s <span>third—but</span> not <span>final—conviction</span> came in 2021 when he pled guilty to unlawful possession of a firearm by a previously convicted felon.</p>
<p>Only a year after Adams’s third conviction, however, he was hired to work as a “violence interrupter” by a government-funded Seattle-area nonprofit called Community Passageways. In November 2022, while receiving a salary from King County taxpayers to prevent gun violence, <a href="https://www.kuow.org/stories/king-county-gave-millions-to-no-new-youth-jail-activists-to-help-kids-then-they-looked-away">Adams broke into his ex-girlfriend’s apartment, held her new boyfriend at gunpoint, and was subsequently shot by the ex’s eighteen-year-old cousin</a>. Adding a surreal element to this already incredible story, Savior Wheeler, the young cousin who shot Khalid Adams, <em>was a client of Community Passageways</em>, one of the same at-risk young people that Adams was supposed to keep away from gun violence. A Seattle nonprofit therefore hired a three-time convicted felon who was fresh out of prison to work as a mentor for at-risk youths, and he was subsequently shot by one of those very at-risk youths while threatening an ex-girlfriend at gunpoint.</p>
<p>This is a surprisingly common occurrence in Seattle. In 2022, the city <a href="https://www.kuow.org/stories/renegades-for-life">gave $260,000 dollars to a registered sex offender who was operating under a fake name and credentials</a> to mentor at-risk young people. In 2020, they gave a $3 million no-bid <span>contract—one</span> of the largest grants in city <span>history—to</span> a nonprofit called Freedom Project <a href="https://sccinsight.com/2021/03/08/black-brilliance-research-project-wraps-up-with-allegations-recriminations-but-no-city-investigation/">to run a “racial equity study.”</a> Freedom Project’s executive director at the time <a href="https://sccinsight.com/2021/07/29/the-black-brilliance-research-project-beginning-to-end-part-2/">was David Heppard</a> who was convicted as a teenager <a href="https://washington.lexroll.com/in-re-personal-restraint-of-heppard-25154-0-ii-wash-app-2-9-2001/">for taking part in the gang rape of a pregnant seventeen-year-old</a>. Freedom Project’s finance director, <a href="https://freedomprojectwa.org/staff/">Quddafi Howell</a>, <a href="https://casetext.com/case/state-v-howell-57/#f33e5844-49ea-4a7e-a9aa-8d5835fe0078-fn1">once shot up a man’s house as an intimidation tactic to prevent him from snitching on Howell’s drug dealing</a>.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, the $3 million Seattle handed over to a bunch of convicted felons was somehow mismanaged. A local political blog called <em>Seattle City Council Insight</em> looked into the paperwork behind this contract and discovered that <a href="https://sccinsight.com/2021/07/29/the-black-brilliance-research-project-beginning-to-end-part-3/">hundreds of thousands of dollars were handed out to subcontractors for minimal work</a> and the project’s lead was paid <em>$300 per hour</em> while publicly claiming to be a volunteer.</p>
<p>In another case, a homelessness nonprofit called share (the Seattle Housing and Resource Effort) <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/seattle-weighs-charges-over-homeless-nonprofits-use-of-unlicensed-accountant/">turned out to employ an unlicensed accountant</a> at the same time they were handling millions of dollars in government funds. Share claimed that they were the victim in this case, as they were unknowingly defrauded by a man who held himself out as a legitimate accountant. Fair enough. Share, however, might have noticed that their accountant was unlicensed were it not for the fact that share’s <em>treasurer</em>, the man presumably responsible for handling all their money, <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/display_990/911577965/12_2017_prefixes_84-91%2F911577965_201612_990_2017121215021639">was Lantz Rowland</a>, <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/tent-city-dispute-sends-homeless-packing/">an unqualified homeless man who lived in a tent</a>. This nonprofit <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/911577965">had total annual revenue of approximately a million dollars in 2016</a>, which included grants from King County and the City of Seattle, and the people responsible for handling that money were an illegal accountant and a sixty-year-old homeless tent dweller with no discernible qualifications.</p>
<p>Leaving the West Coast for a moment, one finds similar outcomes arising from the overuse of nonprofits in the Windy City. In Chicago, an anti-violence nonprofit called CeaseFire has had a shocking number of its “violence interrupters” <a href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/2018/4/10/18328589/ceasefire-worker-gets-27-months-in-prison-for-federal-gun-conviction">arrested for serious crimes since its incep­tion</a>. This ought to surprise nobody given that these “violence interrupters” are almost universally convicted felons. Ceasefire workers convicted of crimes while employed by the organization include <a href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/2018/4/10/18328589/ceasefire-worker-gets-27-months-in-prison-for-federal-gun-conviction">a fifty-one-year-old arrested for illegal gun possession</a>, whom authorities alleged was also moonlighting as a national gang leader; a convicted felon <a href="https://nypost.com/2023/01/13/chicago-police-arrest-jerel-taylor-for-guns-and-drugs/">caught naked under his bed with $50,000, an illegal firearm, crack cocaine, and heroin</a>; and a woman who was hired despite four prior felony convictions and <a href="https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/ceasefire-worker-charged-in-diamond-theft/64106/">subsequently stole $10,000 worth of diamonds</a>.</p>
<p>Chicago also has a state-funded <a href="https://www.illinois.gov/news/press-release.26485.html#:~:text=CHICAGO%E2%80%94Ahead%20of%20Memorial%20Day,in%20the%20City%20of%20Chicago.">“Peacekeepers” program</a> in which “community-based organizations” deploy former convicts to act as vio­lence interrupters during times when tensions are expected to be high. Last Memorial Day, a “Peacekeeper” named Oscar Montes <a href="https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/man-in-peacekeepers-vest-charged-with-robbing-beating-man-in-little-village/3150581/">assaulted a motorist while on duty</a>, leaving the man with potentially permanent eye damage. Montes was hired by the Peacekeepers program only a year after serving a ten-year prison sentence for shooting a rival gang member.</p>
<p>What is instantly noticeable about the above examples is that none of these people could draw a government paycheck <em>unless it was laundered through a nonprofit</em>. A police department could never hire a convicted felon with long-term ties to street gangs, but a private nonprofit has looser standards regarding who is allowed access to public funds. This not only squanders money on people who are not capable of performing the roles they’re assigned, but is an active threat to public safety in circumstances where the state uses convict-staffed nonprofits for duties that ought to be reserved for the police.</p>
<h3><span><strong>The Progressive Doom Loop</strong></span></h3>
<p>At the start of this piece, I said that “the act of naming is a form of propaganda,” an aphorism which applies to nonprofits because the name they’ve been given is a marketing device, rather than an objective representation of their conduct and behavior. It’s important to recognize, though, that nonprofits aren’t the only group relevant to this story that has been given an inaccurate name as a marketing ploy. The political ideology that supports the nonprofit industrial complex is generally referred to as “progressivism,” which calls to mind the socialist-leaning Progressive movement of the early twentieth century. In spite of sharing a common name, however, today’s “progressivism” has nothing in common with the Progressive movements of the last century, is not socialist in any real sense, and is, if anything, an extremist libertarian movement that destroys the ability of the government to function, rather than using state power for the betterment of the poor.</p>
<p>Once you start digging into the evidence, you find that the places where “progressives” wield the most power are some of the <em>least</em> socialist governments in the country. In 2022, San Francisco <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230327233844/https:/www.sfchronicle.com/projects/2023/san-francisco-contracts/">spent $5.8 billion on private contracts</a>, over 40 percent of all city government spending, while the entire budget of Houston, a city 2.5 times as large, <a href="https://communityimpact.com/houston/heights-river-oaks-montrose/government/2022/06/02/houston-city-council-approves-fiscal-year-2022-23-budget/">was only $5.7 billion</a>. It is a strange form of socialism that runs more than two-fifths of its government through private contractors, instead of using publicly owned developers and social housing.</p>
<p>Portland, Oregon, meanwhile, has been suffering from a serious trash crisis for the past several years, due both to the city’s soaring homeless population and the government’s refusal to enforce antidumping laws. Portland’s response to the festering trash piles now blighting a once-beautiful city has not been to dramatically increase the government’s capacity to pick up and process garbage; instead, Portland, in conjunction with the state of Oregon, <a href="https://www.opb.org/article/2023/06/15/oregon-multnomah-county-fund-portland-trash-clean-up-program/">has paid millions of dollars to </a><a href="https://www.opb.org/article/2023/06/15/oregon-multnomah-county-fund-portland-trash-clean-up-program/">nonprofits</a><a href="https://www.opb.org/article/2023/06/15/oregon-multnomah-county-fund-portland-trash-clean-up-program/"> to deal with the trash problem</a>.</p>
<p>As Portland outsourced trash collection to private nonprofit organi­zations, the ability of the <em>government</em> to collect trash has been gutted by budget cuts and a lack of resources. According to <a href="https://www.kgw.com/article/news/local/the-story/portland-task-force-trash-garbage-cleanup-downtown-central-city/283-2d09202c-837c-4147-b47d-69da51dfdd32">local activist Frank Moscow</a>, Portland used to sweep every street as a matter of course, but currently only has one functioning street sweeper in the entire city. Not that it matters much, <a href="https://www.portland.gov/transportation/maintenance/street-sweeping#:~:text=street%20cleaning%20pilot-,Overview,street%20sweeping%20June%2030%2C%202023.">since Portland’s Bureau of Transportation sus­pended all street sweeping activities last June after another series of budget cuts</a>.</p>
<p>Adding to Portland’s trash-addled misery is the city’s inability to stop anyone from dumping their trash where it is not legally allowed to do so. In 2016, <a href="https://www.oregonmetro.gov/news/illegal-dumping-year-numbers">the city issued thirty-one citations for illegal dumping</a>; in 2021, <a href="https://kpic.com/news/local/homeless-not-only-ones-contributing-to-portlands-trash-problem">they issued a grand total of one citation</a>, for a measly $154. <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/opinion/2022/03/opinion-volunteers-alone-cant-clean-up-portlands-trash.html">An opinion column published in the <em>Oregonian</em> in 2022</a> asserted confidently that “you could dump 10 large bags of garbage in Pioneer Square tonight and drive off without fear of being caught or penalized,” before going on to complain that Portland picks up trash from residential units <em>every two weeks,</em> instead of offering weekly trash pickup like almost every other city of comparable size.</p>
<p>This is the state of affairs in almost every city where “progressives” have a large impact on local politics. Progressives claim to support government spending programs, but <em>also</em> have an anarchistic, anti-governmental attitude that can be seen in their support for policies like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/12/opinion/sunday/floyd-abolish-defund-police.html">police abolition in 2020</a>. Although progressives want the government to <em>fund</em> public programs, their opposition to centralized state power means they often don’t want the government to <em>run</em> the programs being funded.</p>
<p>The cities progressives control therefore tend to underfund core government agencies in favor of “community-based organizations,” by which they mean NGOs and nonprofits. Once the government can no longer meet its responsibilities, progressive cities outsource those ser­vices to nonprofit organizations, effectively privatizing the government.</p>
<p>A serious problem then occurs. Using several nonprofits instead of one government agency is inherently inefficient due to weak oversight and an inability to take advantage of economies of scale. That’s why cities on the West Coast spend so much on homelessness to no end whatsoever. San Francisco’s spending on homeless services increased from <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/projects/2022/san-francisco-sros/">$200 million in 2016 to an astronomical $1.1 billion in 2021</a>. Despite this incredible investment, on an average night <a href="https://missionlocal.org/2022/05/sf-homeless-drop-pit-count-sip-hotels/">there were a thousand more homeless San Franciscans in 2022 than there were in 2015</a>. In fairness, there was a decline in the city’s homeless population between 2019 and 2022, leading the deputy director at the San Francisco Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing to declare that “investment works.” Yet San Francisco’s population <a href="https://datacommons.org/tools/timeline#&amp;place=geoId/0667000&amp;statsVar=Count_Person">fell by seventy thousand resi­dents between 2019 and 2022</a>, meaning the miniscule re­duction in homelessness was likely a mere by-product of massive population loss.</p>
<p>Nor are the problems that cities like San Francisco, Portland, and Seattle have with falling population unrelated. By funding inefficient nonprofits instead of more centralized, accountable government initia­tives, progressive cities have high <em>taxes</em> but poor <em>services</em>; residents receive nothing in return for the taxes they pay. <a href="https://www.koin.com/news/portland/report-high-tax-rates-could-be-driving-people-out-of-portland/#:~:text=According%20to%20their%20data%2C%20Portland's,have%20to%20make%20%2425%20million.">Portland has one of the highest municipal income tax burdens in the country</a>, <a href="https://www.wweek.com/news/2022/09/28/portland-ranks-48th-among-50-big-cities-for-cops-per-capita/">but is forty-eighth out of the fifty largest cities in police staffing</a>, has piles of festering, uncollected garbage littering its streets, and only has two thousand shelter beds <a href="https://www.portland.gov/wheeler/homelessness#:~:text=The%20complexity%20of%20the%20homelessness,from%201%2C887%20to%206%2C297%20individu">for a homeless population of 6,300</a>, requiring four thousand homeless Portlanders to sleep outside even if every one of them wanted a bed.</p>
<p>Contrary to the conservative assumption that high taxes are an inherent evil, people are often fine with higher taxes provided that the taxes are utilized to improve local living standards. What is taking place in America’s most performatively socialist urban areas is that taxes are constantly raised in order to fund public services, resulting in some of the most heavily taxed populations in the country. But this tax revenue is then squandered on private contracts to unaccountable nonprofit organizations whose activities do little to rectify the problems they are nominally being funded to address.</p>
<p>Taxes soar in concert with the collapse in local living standards and the decay in public services. Public parks where children used to play fill up with homeless drug addicts who leave used needles near jungle gyms; a six-year-old girl in California mistook a syringe for a thermometer <a href="https://abc7news.com/needles-found-in-sf-left-on-streets-report-study-san-francisco/2226877/">and put it in her mouth</a>, and an eleven-year-old stepped on a needle while swimming in Santa Cruz. The streets grow increasingly unsanitary due to spiraling homelessness, reintroducing diseases once considered eradi­cated by civilized living. Los Angeles <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/03/health/fleaborne-typhus-la-county-cdc-wellness/index.html">had three deaths from flea-borne typhus in 2022</a>, the first such deaths in three decades; a reverend who works on Skid Row <a href="https://www.dailynews.com/2016/12/10/homeless-advocate-who-lost-leg-walking-skid-row-returns-to-the-streets/">lost both legs to an infection he contracted simply walking the neighborhood’s streets</a>; and Portland’s Old Town recently experienced an outbreak of Shigella, a disease mostly seen in developing countries that <a href="https://www.kgw.com/article/news/local/homeless/contagious-illness-spreads-old-town-hospital/283-c5856d2a-c962-4270-b5b9-4d111abe9697">spreads through fecal matter</a>.</p>
<p>The inability of nonprofits to properly manage services results in European taxes for third-world state capacity. Residents don’t know what the problem is: they don’t know that their taxes go to “violence interrupters” who are convicted felons; they don’t know affordable housing nonprofits use taxpayer money to lobby against affordable housing; and they don’t know money is being misallocated due to insuf­ficient oversight of nonprofits.</p>
<p>All they know is they pay high taxes for no reason. And so they leave. Oregon’s largest county <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/politics/2023/03/multnomah-county-lost-residents-faster-than-any-other-oregon-county-census-bureau-says.html#:~:text=a%20million%20people.-,Oregon's%20largest%20county%20shed%202.5%25%20of%20its%20population%20from%20April,lost%20more%20than%2010%2C500%20residents.">lost 2.5 percent of its population between 2020 and 2022</a>. As the population declines, the tax base shrinks. San Francisco’s sales tax revenue <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/downtown-sf-retail-18076696.php">fell 22 percent between 2019 and 2022</a>, with the worst decline seen downtown, where office buildings <a href="https://sfstandard.com/2023/04/05/downtown-san-francisco-vacancies-hit-record-high-as-city-nears-breaking-point/">now have record-high vacancy rates</a>.</p>
<p>Many articles have been written recently about the threat such cities face <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/06/the-urban-doom-loop-threatening-cities-like-new-york-and-san-francisco.html">of an “urban doom loop,”</a> in which a falling population guts tax revenue, which forces cuts to city services, thus reducing livability and causing an accelerating population exodus in a vicious cycle. To my knowledge, however, nobody has ever argued that a major contributor to this death spiral is outsourcing government services to unaccountable nonprofit organizations, rather than increasing state capacity and im­proving the government’s ability to solve problems itself. In this contrarian narrative, American cities are not failing because they’re too socialist; they’re failing because they aren’t socialist enough.</p>
<p>And that, alas, is the state of the great American city in the early twenty-first century, where nothing is as it seems. Ours is a country where “progressivism” has nothing in common with the movement from which it takes its name; where “socialists” privatize government services at every opportunity; and where countless “nonprofits” exist solely for the misbegotten profit of the people who run them. Again and again, the names we use to explain the realities of modern urban politics are propagandistic marketing terms and not an accurate representation of what is taking place.</p>
<p>Just like with the invention of the Chilean Sea Bass, <span>however—which</span> is neither Chilean nor a <span>bass—many</span> people are making money off the scheme. Who cares if it’s all a lie?</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://sparktoro.com/blog/an-anonymous-source-shared-thousands-of-leaked-google-search-api-documents-with-me-everyone-in-seo-should-see-them/">https://sparktoro.com/blog/an-anonymous-source-shared-thousands-of-leaked-google-search-api-documents-with-me-everyone-in-seo-should-see-them/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40496967">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>On Sunday, May 5th, I received an email from a person claiming to have access to a massive leak of API documentation from inside Google’s Search division. The email further claimed that these leaked documents were confirmed as authentic by ex-Google employees, and that those ex-employees and others had shared additional, private information about Google’s search operations.</p>
<p>Many of their claims directly contradict <a href="https://www.seroundtable.com/google-ctr-search-rankings-27157.html">public statements</a> made by Googlers over the years, in particular the company’s <a href="https://www.seroundtable.com/google-ctr-dwell-time-signals-myths-27083.html">repeated denial</a> that <a href="https://www.blindfiveyearold.com/is-click-through-rate-a-ranking-signal">click-centric user signals</a> are employed, <a href="https://iloveseo.com/seo/google-says-subdomains-vs-subfolders-doesnt-matter/">denial</a> that subdomains are considered separately in rankings, <a href="https://www.seroundtable.com/google-sandbox-nope-28082.html">denials</a> of a sandbox for newer websites, <a href="https://www.seroundtable.com/google-domain-age-23697.html">denials</a> that a domain’s age is collected or considered, and more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naturally, I was skeptical. The claims made by this source (who asked to remain anonymous) seemed extraordinary–claims like:</p>
<ul>
<li>In their early years, Google’s search team recognized a need for full clickstream data (every URL visited by a browser) for a large percent of web users to improve their search engine’s result quality.</li>
<li>A system called “NavBoost” (cited by VP of Search, Pandu Nayak, in his <a href="https://thecapitolforum.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/101823-USA-v-Google-PM.pdf">DOJ case testimony</a>) initially gathered data from Google’s <a href="https://moz.com/blog/what-is-googles-pagerank-good-for-whiteboard-friday">Toolbar PageRank</a>, and desire for more clickstream data served as the key motivation for creation of the Chrome browser (<a href="https://www.npr.org/2008/09/05/94299337/google-launches-chrome-web-browser">launched</a> in 2008).</li>
<li>NavBoost uses the number of searches for a given keyword to identify trending search demand, the number of clicks on a search result (I ran <a href="https://sparktoro.com/blog/queries-clicks-influence-googles-results/">several</a> <a href="https://x.com/randfish/status/1704722903550644430">experiments</a> on this from 2013-2015), and long clicks versus short clicks (which I <a href="https://moz.com/blog/impact-of-queries-and-clicks-on-googles-rankings-whiteboard-friday">presented theories about in this 2015 video</a>).</li>
<li>Google utilizes cookie history, logged-in Chrome data, and pattern detection (referred to in the leak as “unsquashed” clicks versus “squashed” clicks) as effective means for fighting manual &amp; automated click spam.</li>
<li>NavBoost also scores queries for user intent. For example, certain thresholds of attention and clicks on videos or images will trigger video or image features for that query and related, NavBoost-associated queries.</li>
<li>Google examines clicks and engagement on searches both during and after the main query (referred to as a “NavBoost query”). For instance, if many users search for “Rand Fishkin,” don’t find SparkToro, and immediately change their query to “SparkToro” and click SparkToro.com in the search result, SparkToro.com (and websites mentioning “SparkToro”) will receive a boost in the search results for the “Rand Fishkin” keyword.</li>
<li>NavBoost’s data is used at the host level for evaluating a site’s overall quality (my anonymous source speculated that this could be what Google and SEOs called “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k06ezwACeNM">Panda</a>”). This evaluation can result in a boost or a demotion.</li>
<li>Other minor factors such as penalties for domain names that exactly match unbranded search queries (e.g. mens-luxury-watches.com or milwaukee-homes-for-sale.net), a newer “BabyPanda” score, and spam signals are also considered during the quality evaluation process.</li>
<li>NavBoost geo-fences click data, taking into account country and state/province levels, as well as mobile versus desktop usage. However, if Google lacks data for certain regions or user-agents, they may apply the process universally to the query results.</li>
<li>During the Covid-19 pandemic, Google employed whitelists for websites that could appear high in the results for Covid-related searches</li>
<li>Similarly, during democratic elections, Google employed whitelists for sites that should be shown (or demoted) for election-related information</li>
</ul>
<p>And these are only the tip of the iceberg.</p>
<p>Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. And while some of these overlap with information revealed during the Google/DOJ case (some of which <a href="https://x.com/randfish/status/1288980563219513345">you can read about on this thread from 2020</a>), many are novel and suggest insider knowledge.</p>
<p>So, this past Friday, May 24th (following several emails), I had a video call with the anonymous source.</p>

<p>Prior to the email and call, I had neither met nor heard of the person who emailed me about this leak. They asked that their identity remain veiled, and that I merely include the quote below:</p>
<p><em>An eagle uses the storm to reach unimaginable heights.</em><br>– Matshona Dhliwayo</p>
<p>After the call I was able to confirm details of their work history, mutual people we both know from the marketing world, and several of their claims about being at particular events with industry insiders (including Googlers), though I cannot confirm details of the meetings nor the content of discussions they claim to have had.</p>
<p>During our call, this contact showed me the leak itself: more than 2,500 pages of API documentation containing 14,014 attributes (API features) that appear to come from Google’s internal “Content API Warehouse.” Based on the document’s commit history, this code was uploaded to GitHub on Mar 27, 2024th and not removed until May 7, 2024th.</p>
<p>This documentation doesn’t show things like the weight of particular elements in the search ranking algorithm, nor does it prove which elements are used in the ranking systems. But, it does show incredible details about data Google collects. Here’s an example of the document format:</p>
<div>

<p>After walking me through a handful of these API modules, the source explained their motivations (around transparency, holding Google to account, etc.) and their hope: that I would publish an article sharing this leak, revealing some of the many interesting pieces of data it contained, and refuting some “lies” Googlers “had been spreading for years.”</p>

<h2>Is this API Leak Authentic? Can We Trust It?</h2>
<p>A critical next step in the process was verifying the authenticity of the API Content Warehouse documents.&nbsp; So, I reached out to some ex-Googler friends, shared the leaked docs, and asked for their thoughts. Three ex-Googlers wrote back: one said they didn’t feel comfortable looking at or commenting on it. The other two shared the following (off the record and anonymously):</p>
<ul>
<li>“I didn’t have access to this code when I worked there. But this certainly looks legit. “</li>
<li>“It has all the hallmarks of an internal Google API.”</li>
<li>“It’s a Java-based API. And someone spent a lot of time adhering to Google’s own internal standards for documentation and naming.”</li>
<li>“I’d need more time to be sure, but this matches internal documentation I’m familiar with.”</li>
<li>“Nothing I saw in a brief review suggests this is anything but legit.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Next, I needed help analyzing and deciphering the naming conventions and more technical aspects of the documentation. I’ve worked with APIs a bit, but it’s been 20 years since I wrote code and 6 years since I practiced SEO professionally. So, I reached out to one of the world’s foremost technical SEOs: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelkingphilly/">Mike King</a>, founder of <a href="https://ipullrank.com/">iPullRank</a>.</p>
<p>During a 40-minute phone call on Friday afternoon, Mike reviewed the leak and confirmed my suspicions: <strong>this appears to be a legitimate set of documents from inside Google’s Search division</strong>, and contains an extraordinary amount of previously-unconfirmed information about Google’s inner workings.</p>
<p>2,500 technical documents is an unreasonable amount of material to ask one man (a dad, husband, and entrepreneur, no less) to review in a single weekend. But, that didn’t stop Mike from doing his best.<br>He’s put together an <strong><a href="https://ipullrank.com/google-algo-leak">exceptionally detailed initial review of the Google API leak here</a></strong>, which I’ll reference more in the findings below. And he’s also agreed to join us at <a href="https://sparktoro.com/sparktogether">SparkTogether 2024</a> in Seattle, WA on Oct. 8, where he’ll present the fully transparent story of this leak in far greater detail, and with the benefit of the next few months of analysis.</p>

<h2>Qualifications and Motivations for this Post</h2>
<p>Before we go further, a few disclaimers: I no longer work in the SEO field. My knowledge of and experience with SEO is 6+ years out of date. I don’t have the technical expertise or knowledge of Google’s internal operations to analyze an API documentation leak and confirm with certainty whether it’s authentic (hence getting Mike’s help and the input of ex-Googlers).</p>
<p>So why publish on this topic?</p>
<p>Because when I spoke to the party that sent me this information, I found them credible, thoughtful, and deeply knowledgeable. Despite going into the conversation deeply skeptical, I could identify no red flags, nor any malicious motivation. This person’s sole aim appeared quite aligned with my own: to hold Google accountable for public statements that conflict with private conversations and leaked documentation, and to bring greater transparency to the field of search marketing. And they believed that, despite my years removed from SEO, I was the best person to share this publicly.</p>
<p>These are goals I cared about deeply for almost two decades. And while my professional life has moved on (I now run two companies: <a href="https://sparktoro.com/">SparkToro</a>, which makes audience research software and <a href="https://snackbarstudio.com/">Snackbar Studio</a>, an indie video game developer), my interest in and connections to the world of Search Engine Optimization remain strong. I feel a deep obligation to share information about how the world’s dominant search engine works, especially information Google would prefer to keep quiet. And sadly, I’m not sure where else to send something this potentially groundbreaking.</p>
<p>Years ago, before he left journalism to become Google’s Search Liaison, <a href="https://dannysullivan.com/">Danny Sullivan</a>, would have been my go-to source for a leak of this magnitude. He had the gravitas, resume, knowledge, and experience to examine a claim like this and present it fairly in the court of public opinion. There have been so many times in the last few years I’ve wished for Danny’s calm, even-handed, tough-but-fair-on-Google approach to newsworthy pieces like this–pieces that could reach as far as the company’s statements on the witness stand (e.g. <a href="https://martech.org/dark-google-search-terms-not-provided-one-year-later/">his eloquent writing on Google’s indefensible privacy claims about organic keyword data</a>).</p>
<p>Whatever Google’s paying him, it isn’t nearly enough.</p>

<h2>What is the Google API Content Warehouse?</h2>
<p>When looking through the massive trove of API documentation, the first reasonable set of questions might be: “What is this? What is it used for? Why does it exist in the first place?”</p>
<div>
<figure data-wp-context="{&quot;uploadedSrc&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/images.sparktoro.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/google-api-content-warehouse-reference-anchors.png&quot;,&quot;figureClassNames&quot;:&quot;aligncenter size-large&quot;,&quot;figureStyles&quot;:null,&quot;imgClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-image-8950&quot;,&quot;imgStyles&quot;:null,&quot;targetWidth&quot;:1180,&quot;targetHeight&quot;:794,&quot;scaleAttr&quot;:false,&quot;ariaLabel&quot;:&quot;Enlarge image&quot;,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-wp-interactive="core/image"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="689" data-wp-init="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on--click="actions.showLightbox" data-wp-on--load="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-window--resize="callbacks.setButtonStyles" src="https://images.sparktoro.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/google-api-content-warehouse-reference-anchors-1024x689.png" alt="" srcset="https://images.sparktoro.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/google-api-content-warehouse-reference-anchors-1024x689.png 1024w, https://images.sparktoro.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/google-api-content-warehouse-reference-anchors-300x202.png 300w, https://images.sparktoro.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/google-api-content-warehouse-reference-anchors-768x517.png 768w, https://images.sparktoro.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/google-api-content-warehouse-reference-anchors.png 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>
<p>The leak appears to come from <a href="https://github.com/googleapis/">GitHub</a>, and the most credible explanation for its exposure matches what my anonymous source told me on our call: these documents were inadvertently and briefly made public (many links in the documentation point to <a href="https://github.com/googleapis/google-api-nodejs-client/issues/1884">private GitHub repositories</a> and <a href="https://g3doc.corp.google.com/repository/webref/preprocessing/names/tnc_classifier/README.md">internal pages on Google’s corporate site</a> that require specific, Google-credentialed logins). During this probably-accidental, public period between March and May of 2024, the API documentation was spread to Hexdocs (which indexes public GitHub repos) and found/circulated by other sources (I’m certain that others have a copy, though it’s odd that I could find no public discourse until now).</p>
<p>According to my ex-Googler sources, documentation like this exists on almost every Google team, explaining various API attributes and modules to help familiarize those working on a project with the data elements available. This leak matches others in public GitHub repositories and on <a href="https://cloud.google.com/apis/docs/overview">Google’s Cloud API documentation</a>, using the same notation style, formatting, and even process/module/feature names and references.</p>
<p>If that all sounds like a technical mouthful, think of this as instructions for members of Google’s search engine team. It’s like an inventory of books in a library, a card catalogue of sorts, telling those employees who need to know what’s available and how they can get it.</p>
<p>But, whereas libraries are public, Google search is one of the most secretive, closely-guarded black boxes in the world. <strong>In the last quarter century, no leak of this magnitude or detail has ever been reported from Google’s search division</strong>.</p>
<h2>How certain can we be that Google’s search engine uses everything detailed in these API docs?</h2>
<p>That’s open to interpretation. Google could have retired some of these, used others exclusively for testing or internal projects, or may even have made API features available that were never employed.</p>
<p>However, there are references in the documentation to deprecated features and specific notes on others indicating they should no longer be used. That strongly suggests those not marked with such details were still in active use as of the March, 2024 leak.</p>
<p>We also can’t say for certain whether the March leak is of the most recent version of this documentation. The most recent date I can find referenced in the API docs is August of 2023:</p>
<div>
<figure data-wp-context="{&quot;uploadedSrc&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/images.sparktoro.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/august-2023-reference-in-google-api-leak.png&quot;,&quot;figureClassNames&quot;:&quot;aligncenter size-full&quot;,&quot;figureStyles&quot;:null,&quot;imgClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-image-8952&quot;,&quot;imgStyles&quot;:null,&quot;targetWidth&quot;:922,&quot;targetHeight&quot;:431,&quot;scaleAttr&quot;:false,&quot;ariaLabel&quot;:&quot;Enlarge image&quot;,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-wp-interactive="core/image"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="922" height="431" data-wp-init="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on--click="actions.showLightbox" data-wp-on--load="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-window--resize="callbacks.setButtonStyles" src="https://images.sparktoro.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/august-2023-reference-in-google-api-leak.png" alt="" srcset="https://images.sparktoro.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/august-2023-reference-in-google-api-leak.png 922w, https://images.sparktoro.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/august-2023-reference-in-google-api-leak-300x140.png 300w, https://images.sparktoro.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/august-2023-reference-in-google-api-leak-768x359.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 922px) 100vw, 922px"></figure></div>
<p>The relevant text reads:</p>
<p><em>“The domain-level display name of the website, such as “Google” for google.com. See go/site-display-name for more details. <strong>As of Aug 2023, this field is being deprecated</strong> in favor of info.[AlternativeTitlesResponse].site_display_name_response field, which also contains host-level site display names with additional information.”</em></p>
<p>A reasonable reader would conclude that the documentation was up-to-date as of last summer (references to other changes in 2023 and earlier years, all the way back to 2005, are also present), and possibly even up-to-date as of the March 2024 date of disclosure.</p>
<p>Google search obviously changes massively from year to year, and recent introductions like their <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/shut-down-google-ai-overview-3446038/">much-maligned AI Overviews</a>, do not make an appearance in this leak. Which of the items mentioned are actively used today in Google’s ranking systems? That’s open to speculation. This trove contains fascinating references, many that will be entirely new to non-Google-search-engineers.</p>
<p>But,<strong> I would urge readers not to point to a particular API feature in this leak and say: “SEE! That’s proof Google uses XYZ in their rankings.”</strong> It’s not quite proof. It’s a strong indication, stronger than patent applications or public statements from Googlers, but still no guarantee.</p>
<p>That said, it’s as close to a smoking gun as anything since <a href="https://www.justice.gov/d9/2023-11/418021.pdf">Google’s execs testified in the DOJ trial</a> last year. And, speaking of that testimony, much of it is corroborated and expanded on in the document leak, as Mike <a href="https://ipullrank.com/google-algo-leak">details in his post</a>. 👀</p>
<h2><strong>What can we learn from the Data Warehouse Leak?</strong></h2>
<p>I expect that interesting and marketing-applicable insights will be mined from this massive file set for years to come. It’s simply too big and too dense to think that a weekend of browsing could unearth a comprehensive set of takeaways, or even come close.</p>
<p>However, I will share five of the most interesting, early discoveries in my perusal, some that shed new light on things Google has long been assumed to be doing, and others that suggest the company’s public statements (especially those on what they “collect”) have been erroneous. Because doing so would be tedious and could be perceived as personal grievances (given Google’s historic attacks on my work), I won’t bother showing side-by-sides of what Googlers said vs. what this document insinuates. Besides, Mike did a great job of that in his post.</p>
<p>Instead, I’ll focus on interesting and/or useful takeaways, and my conclusions from the whole of the modules I’ve been able to review, <a href="https://ipullrank.com/google-algo-leak">Mike’s piece</a> on the leak, and how this combines with other things we know to be true of Google.</p>
<h2>#1: Navboost and the use of clicks, CTR, long vs. short clicks, and user data</h2>
<div>

<p>A handful of modules in the documentation make reference to features like “goodClicks,” “badClicks,” “lastLongestClicks,” impressions, squashed, unsquashed, and unicorn clicks. These are tied to Navboost and Glue, two words that may be familiar to folks who reviewed <a href="https://thecapitolforum.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/101823-USA-v-Google-PM.pdf">Google’s DOJ testimony</a>. Here’s a relevant excerpt from DOJ attorney Kenneth Dintzer’s cross-examination of Pandu Nayak, VP of Search on the Search Quality team:</p>
<p>Q. So remind me, is navboost all the way back to 2005?<br>A. It’s somewhere in that range. It might even be before that.</p>
<p>Q. And it’s been updated. It’s not the same old navboost that it was back then?<br>A. No.</p>
<p>Q. And another one is glue, right?<br>A. Glue is just another name for navboost that includes all of the other features on the page.</p>
<p>Q. Right. I was going to get there later, but we can do that now. Navboost does web results, just like we discussed, right?<br>A. Yes.</p>
<p>Q. And glue does everything else that’s on the page that’s not web results, right?<br>A. That is correct.</p>
<p>Q. Together they help find the stuff and rank the stuff that ultimately shows up on our SERP?<br>A. That is true. They’re both signals into that, yes.</p>
<p>A savvy reader of these API documents would find they support Mr. Nayak’s testimony (and align with Google’s <a href="https://thecapitolforum.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/101823-USA-v-Google-PM.pdf">patent on site quality</a>):</p>

</ul>
<p>Google appears to have ways to filter out clicks they don’t want to count in their ranking systems, and include ones they do. They also seem to measure length of clicks (i.e. <a href="https://moz.com/blog/seo-satisfaction">pogo-sticking</a> – when a searcher clicks a result and then quickly clicks the back button, unsatisfied by the answer they found) and impressions.</p>
<p>Plenty has already been written about Google’s use of click data, so I won’t belabor the point. What matters is that Google has named and described features for that measurement, adding even more evidence to the pile.</p>
<h2>#2: Use of Chrome browser clickstreams to power Google Search</h2>
<div>
<figure data-wp-context="{&quot;uploadedSrc&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/images.sparktoro.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/chrome-total-views-google-api-content-warehouse.gif&quot;,&quot;figureClassNames&quot;:&quot;aligncenter size-large&quot;,&quot;figureStyles&quot;:null,&quot;imgClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-image-8959&quot;,&quot;imgStyles&quot;:null,&quot;targetWidth&quot;:1043,&quot;targetHeight&quot;:521,&quot;scaleAttr&quot;:false,&quot;ariaLabel&quot;:&quot;Enlarge image&quot;,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-wp-interactive="core/image"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="512" data-wp-init="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on--click="actions.showLightbox" data-wp-on--load="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-window--resize="callbacks.setButtonStyles" src="https://images.sparktoro.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/chrome-total-views-google-api-content-warehouse-1024x512.gif" alt="" srcset="https://images.sparktoro.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/chrome-total-views-google-api-content-warehouse-1024x512.gif 1024w, https://images.sparktoro.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/chrome-total-views-google-api-content-warehouse-300x150.gif 300w, https://images.sparktoro.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/chrome-total-views-google-api-content-warehouse-768x384.gif 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>
<p>My anonymous source claimed that way back in 2005, Google wanted the full clickstream of billions of Internet users, and with Chrome, they’ve now got it. The API documents suggest Google calculates several types of metrics that can be called using Chrome views related to both individual pages and entire domains.</p>
<p><a href="https://hexdocs.pm/google_api_content_warehouse/0.4.0/GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.QualitySitemapTargetGroup.html#module-attributes">This document</a>, describing the features around how Google creates Sitelinks, is particularly interesting. It showcases a call named topUrl, which is “A list of top urls with highest two_level_score, i.e., chrome_trans_clicks.” My read is that Google likely uses the number of clicks on pages in Chrome browsers and uses that to determine the most popular/important URLs on a site, which go into the calculation of which to include in the sitelinks feature.</p>
<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="608" height="505" src="https://images.sparktoro.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-13.png" alt="" srcset="https://images.sparktoro.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-13.png 608w, https://images.sparktoro.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-13-300x249.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 608px) 100vw, 608px"></figure></div>
<p>E.G. In the above screenshot from Google’s results, pages like “Pricing,” the “Blog,” and the “Login” pages are our most-visited, and Google knows this through their tracking of billions of Chrome users’ clickstreams.</p>

<h2>#3: Whitelists in Travel, Covid, and Politics</h2>
<p>A module on “Good Quality Travel Sites” would lead reasonable readers to conclude that a whitelist exists for Google in the travel sector (unclear if this is exclusively for Google’s “Travel” search tab, or web search more broadly). References in several places to flags for “isCovidLocalAuthority” and “isElectionAuthority” further suggests that Google is whitelisting particular domains that are appropriate to show for highly controversial of potentially problematic queries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, following the 2020 US Presidential election, one candidate claimed (without evidence) that the election had been stolen, and encouraged their followers to storm the Capital and take potentially violent action against lawmakers, i.e. commit an insurrection.</p>
<p>Google would almost certainly be one of the first places people turned to for information about this event, and if their search engine returned propaganda websites that inaccurately portrayed the election evidence, that could directly lead to more contention, violence, or even the end of US democracy. Those of us who want free and fair elections to continue should be very grateful Google’s engineers are employing whitelists in this case.</p>

<h2>#4: Employing Quality Rater Feedback</h2>

<p>Google has long had a quality rating platform called EWOK (Cyrus Shepard, a notable leader in the SEO space, spent several years contributing to this and <a href="https://zyppy.com/seo/google-search-quality-rater/">wrote about it here</a>). We now have evidence that some elements from the quality raters are used in the search systems.</p>
<p>How influential these rater-based signals are, and what precisely they’re used for is unclear to me in an initial read, but I suspect some thoughtful SEO detectives will dig into the leak, learn, and publish more about it. What I find fascinating is that scores and data generated by EWOK’s quality raters may be <strong>directly involved</strong> in Google’s search system, rather than simply a training set for experiments. Of course, it’s possible these are “just for testing,” but as you browse through the leaked documents, you’ll find that when that’s true, it’s specifically called out in the notes and module details.</p>
<p><a href="https://hexdocs.pm/google_api_content_warehouse/0.3.0/GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.RepositoryWebrefDocLevelRelevanceRatings.html">This one</a> calls out a “per document relevance rating” sourced from evaluations done via EWOK. There’s no detailed notation, but it’s not much of a logic-leap to imagine how important those human evaluations of websites really are.</p>
<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="450" src="https://images.sparktoro.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/humanratings-entities-google-api-warehouse-leak-1024x450.gif" alt="" srcset="https://images.sparktoro.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/humanratings-entities-google-api-warehouse-leak-1024x450.gif 1024w, https://images.sparktoro.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/humanratings-entities-google-api-warehouse-leak-300x132.gif 300w, https://images.sparktoro.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/humanratings-entities-google-api-warehouse-leak-768x338.gif 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>
<p>This one calls out “Human Ratings (e.g. ratings from EWOK)” and notes that they’re “typically only populated in the evaluation pipelines,” which suggests they may be primarily training data in this module (I’d argue that’s still a hugely important role, and marketers shouldn’t dismiss how important it is that quality raters perceive and rate their websites well).</p>

<h2>#5: Google Uses Click Data to Determine How to Weight Links in Rankings</h2>
<p>This one’s fascinating, and comes directly from the anonymous source who first shared the leak. In their words: “Google has three buckets/tiers for classifying their link indexes (low, medium, high quality). Click data is used to determine which link graph index tier a document belongs to. See <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/google_api_content_warehouse/0.4.0/GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.AnchorsAnchor.html">SourceType here</a>, and <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/google_api_content_warehouse/0.4.0/GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.RepositoryWebrefDocumentMetadata.html">TotalClicks here</a>.” In summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>If Forbes.com/Cats/ has no clicks it goes into the low-quality index and the link is ignored</li>
<li>If Forbes.com/Dogs/ has a high volume of clicks from verifiable devices (all the Chrome-related data discussed previously), it goes into the high-quality index and the link passes ranking signals</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the link becomes “trusted” because it belongs to a higher tier index, it can flow PageRank and anchors, or be filtered/demoted by link spam systems. Links from the low-quality link index won’t hurt a site’s ranking; they are merely <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/google_api_content_warehouse/0.4.0/GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.IndexingDocjoinerAnchorSpamInfo.html">ignored</a>.</p>

<h2>Big Picture Takeaways for Marketers who Care About Organic Search Traffic</h2>
<p>If you care strategically about the value of organic search traffic, but don’t have much use for the technical details of how Google works, this section’s for you. It’s my attempt to sum up much of Google’s evolution from the period this leak covers: 2005 – 2023, and I won’t limit myself exclusively to confirmed elements of the leak.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Brand matters more than anything else<br></strong>Google has numerous ways to identify entities, sort, rank, filter, and employ them. Entities include brands (brand names, their official websites, associated social accounts, etc.), and as we’ve <a href="https://sparktoro.com/blog/who-sends-traffic-on-the-web-and-how-much-new-research-from-datos-sparktoro/">seen in our clickstream research with Datos</a>, they’ve been on an inexorable path toward exclusively ranking and sending traffic to big, powerful brands that dominate the web &gt; small, independent sites and businesses.<p>If there was one universal piece of advice I had for marketers seeking to broadly improve their organic search rankings and traffic, it would be: “Build a notable, popular, well-recognized brand in your space, outside of Google search.”</p></li>
<li><strong>Experience, expertise, authoritativeness, and trustworthiness </strong>(“E-E-A-T”)<strong> might not matter as directly as some SEOs think.</strong><br>The only mention of topical expertise in the leak we’ve found so far is a brief <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/google_api_content_warehouse/0.3.0/GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.AppsPeopleOzExternalMergedpeopleapiMapsExtendedData.html#module-attributes">notation</a> about Google Maps review contributions. The other aspects of E-E-A-T are either buried, indirect, labeled in hard-to-identify ways, or, more likely (in my opinion) correlated with things Google uses and cares about, but not specific elements of the ranking systems.<p>As Mike <a href="https://ipullrank.com/google-algo-leak">noted</a> in his article, there is documentation in the leak suggesting Google can identify authors and treats them as entities in the system. Building up one’s influence as an author online may indeed lead to ranking benefits in Google. But what exactly in the ranking systems makes up “E-E-A-T” and how powerful those elements are is an open question. I’m a bit worried that E-E-A-T is 80% propaganda, 20% substance. There are plenty of powerful brands that rank remarkably well in Google and have very little experience, expertise, authoritativeness, or trustworthiness, as <a href="https://housefresh.com/david-vs-digital-goliaths/">HouseFresh’s recent, viral article</a> details in depth.</p></li>
<li><strong>Content and links are secondary when user intention around navigation (and the patterns that intent creates) are present.</strong><br>Let’s say, for example, that many people in the Seattle area search for “Lehman Brothers” and scroll to page 2, 3, or 4 of the search results until they find the theatre listing for the Lehman Brother stage production, then click that result. Fairly quickly, Google will learn that’s what searchers for those words in that area want.<p>Even if the Wikipedia article about Lehman Brothers’ role in the financial crisis of 2008 were to invest heavily in link building and content optimization, it’s unlikely they could outrank the user-intent signals (calculated from queries and clicks) of Seattle’s theatre-goers.</p><p>Extending this example to the broader web and search as a whole, if you can create demand for your website among enough likely searchers in the regions you’re targeting, you may be able to end-around the need for classic on-and-off-page SEO signals like links, anchor text, optimized content, and the like. The power of Navboost and the intent of users is likely the most powerful ranking factor in Google’s systems. As Google VP Alexander Grushetsky put it in <a href="http://chrome-extension//efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://www.justice.gov/d9/2023-11/417828.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a 2019 email to other Google execs</a> (including Danny Sullivan and Pandu Nayak): </p><p>“<em>We already know, one signal could be more powerful than the whole big system on a given metric. For example, I’m pretty sure that NavBoost alone was / is more positive on clicks (and likely even on precision / utility metrics) by itself than the rest of ranking (BTW, engineers outside of Navboost team used to be also not happy about the power of Navboost, and the fact it was “stealing wins”)</em>“</p><p>Those seeking even more confirmation could review Google engineer <a href="https://avalonlibrary.net/Project_Veritas_Google_document_dump/Fake%2520News/Paul%2520Haahr_%2520Google%2520Resume.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1716854833557971&amp;usg=AOvVaw1c5yIN-rzUZDVpR_foAiUp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Paul Haahr’s detailed resume</a>, which states:</p><p><em>“I’m the manager for logs-based ranking projects. The team’s efforts are currently split among four areas: 1) Navboost. This is already one of Google’s strongest ranking signals. Current work is on automation in building new navboost data;”</em></p></li>
<li><strong>Classic ranking factors: PageRank, anchors (topical PageRank based on the anchor text of the link), and text-matching have been waning in importance for years. But Page Titles are still quite important.</strong><br>This is a finding from Mike’s excellent analysis that I’d be foolish not to call out here. PageRank still appears to have a place in search indexing and rankings, but it’s almost certainly evolved from the original 1998 paper. The document leak insinuates multiple versions of PageRank (<a href="https://hexdocs.pm/google_api_content_warehouse/0.3.0/GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.CompositeDocForwardingDup.html#module-attributes">rawPagerank</a>, a deprecated <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/google_api_content_warehouse/0.3.0/GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.GeostoreUrlProto.html#module-attributes">PageRank referencing “nearest seeds,”</a> <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/google_api_content_warehouse/0.3.0/GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.IndexingSignalAggregatorAgeWeightedCoverageData.html#module-attributes">firstCoveragePageRank</a> from when the document was first served, etc.) have been created and discarded over the years. And anchor text links, while present in the leak, don’t seem to be as crucial or omnipresent as I’d have expected from my earlier years in SEO.<br></li>
<li><strong>For most small and medium businesses and newer creators/publishers, SEO is likely to show poor returns until you’ve established credibility, navigational demand, and a strong reputation among a sizable audience.</strong><br>SEO is a big brand, popular domain’s game. As an entrepreneur, I’m not ignoring SEO, but I strongly expect that for the years ahead, until/unless SparkToro becomes a much larger, more popular, more searched-for and clicked-on brand in its industry, this website will continue to be outranked, even for its original content, by aggregators and publishers who’ve existed for 10+ years.<p>This is almost certainly true for other creators, publishers, and SMBs. The content you create is unlikely to perform well in Google if competition from big, popular websites with well-known brands exists. Google no longer rewards scrappy, clever, SEO-savvy operators who know all the right tricks. They reward established brands, search-measurable forms of popularity, and established domains that searchers already know and click. From 1998 – 2018 (or so), one could reasonable start a powerful marketing flywheel with SEO for Google. In 2024, I don’t think that’s realistic, at least, not on the English-language web in competitive sectors.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2>Next Steps for the Search Industry</h2>
<p>I’m excited to see how practitioners with more recent experience and deeper technical knowledge go about analyzing this leak. I encourage anyone curious to dig into the documentation, attempt to connect it to other public documents, statements, testimony, and ranking experiments, then publish their findings.</p>
<p>Historically, some of the search industry’s loudest voices and most prolific publishers have been happy to uncritically repeat Google’s public statements. They write headlines like “Google says XYZ is true,” rather than “Google Claims XYZ; Evidence Suggests Otherwise.”</p>
<div>

<p>Please, do better. If this leak and the DOJ trial can create just one change, I hope this is it.</p>
<p>When those new to the field read Search Engine Roundtable, Search Engine Land, SE Journal, and the many agency blogs and websites that cover the SEO field’s news, they don’t necessarily know how seriously to take Google’s statements. Journalists and authors should not presume that readers are savvy enough to know that dozens or hundreds of past public comments by Google’s official representatives were later proven wrong.</p>
<p>This obligation isn’t just about helping the search industry—it’s about helping the whole world. Google is one of the most powerful, influential forces for the spread of information and commerce on this planet. Only recently have they been held to some account by governments and reporters. The work of journalists and writers in the search marketing field carries weight in the courts of public opinion, in the halls of elected officials, and in the hearts of Google employees, all of whom have the power to change things for the better or ignore them at our collective peril.</p>

<p>It seems like just yesterday WordPress was <a href="https://ma.tt/2016/05/wordpress-is-a-teenager/">becoming a teenager</a>, and in a blink of the eye it’s now old enough to drink! 21 years since <a href="https://mikelittle.org/">Mike</a> and I did the first release of WordPress, forking <a href="https://miche.lv/">Michel’s</a> work on b2/cafélog.</p>



<p>There’s been many milestones and highlights along the way, and many more to come. I’ve been thinking a lot about elements that made WordPress successful in its early years that we should keep in mind as we build this year and beyond. Here’s 11 opinions:</p>



<ol>
<li>Simple things should be easy and intuitive, and complex things possible.</li>



<li>Blogging, commenting, and pingbacks need to be fun. Static websites are fine, but dynamic ones are better. Almost every site would be improved by having a great blog.</li>



<li>Wikis are amazing, and our documentation should be wiki-easy to edit.</li>



<li>Forums should be front and center in the community. <a href="https://bbpress.org/">bbPress</a> and <a href="https://buddypress.org/">BuddyPress</a> need some love.</li>



<li>Every plugin and theme should have all the infrastructure that we use to build WordPress itself—version control, bug trackers, forums, documentation, internationalization, chat rooms, P2, and easy pathways for contribution and community. We shouldn’t be uploading ZIPs in 2024!</li>



<li>Theme previews should be great, and a wide collection of non-commercial themes with diverse aesthetics and functionality are crucial. </li>



<li>We can’t over-index for guidelines and requirements. Better to have good marketplace dynamics and engineer automated feedback loops and transparency to users. Boundaries in functionality and design should be pushed. (But spam and spammy behavior deserves zero tolerance.)</li>



<li>Feedback loops are so important, and should scale with usage and the entire community rather than being reliant on gatekeepers.</li>



<li>Core should be opinionated and quirky: Easter eggs, language with personality even if it’s difficult to translate, jazzy.</li>



<li>Everyone developing and making decisions for software needs to use it.</li>



<li>It’s important that we all do support, go to meetups and events, anything we can to stay close to regular end-users of what we make.</li>
</ol>



<p>What would you add?</p>



<p>Fun fact: On May 27, 2003 I blogged “Working backwards, earlier tonight was great. Put&nbsp;WordPress&nbsp;out, which felt great.” as one sentence in a <a href="https://ma.tt/2003/05/locked-out/">953-word entry written from the porch of my parent’s house</a> where I was accidentally locked out all night until my Dad left in the morning to go to work. Had no idea WordPress would be as big as it is. Earlier that night had set up WP for my friend Ramie Speight, and done some phone tech support for another friend Mike Tremoulet I had met through the local blogger meetup. My friends from high school all had their own domains with WP and that feedback loop was magical for shaping the software.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://docs.blink.sh/advanced/code">https://docs.blink.sh/advanced/code</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40496588">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><main><h2>Blink Code</h2>
<p>VSCode is a very powerful code editor which has become the tool of choice for a lot of developers in record time. Lately, it has been catering to the needs of teams who want to focus on remote and mobile development, accessing their environments from a plethora of devices. The goal of a shell is to expose services to programs and users, and hence inside Blink Shell our approach has been to integrate Code with iOS so we could offer you the best of both worlds:</p>
<ul>
<li>A VSCode experience fitted to your device, that connects to VSCode web, Codespaces, GitPod, or your Code server.</li>
<li>Work on local projects, or edit remote files as if they were in your device, thanks to Blink Files.</li>
<li>First-class iOS experience, with software and hardware keyboard, and the full edge-to-edge experience without interruptions that everyone loves from Blink.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="starting-blink-code">Starting Blink Code</h2>
<pre><code dir="ltr">code &lt;path_or_url&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Blink Code takes a single parameter. If it is a path, it can be local or remote following the same format as SFTP/SCP commands.</p>
<p>To launch Code and begin initial setup, first, run <code dir="ltr">code .</code>. Once it has launched, you will need to install the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=BlinkShellInc.blink-fs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" aria-selected="false">blink-fs</a> extension. Right after installation, this will connect the Code instance to the Blink File System. The navigation sidebar will show the file hierarchy, opening individual files for editing and manipulation.</p>
<p><span><span></span><img alt="img" srcset="https://docs.blink.sh/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fcode-general.f166e889.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://docs.blink.sh/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fcode-general.f166e889.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" loading="lazy" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></span></p>
<h2 id="opening-remote-projects">Opening remote projects</h2>
<p>Remote development on Code could not be any easier thanks to Blink Shell's abilities. If you have already <a href="https://docs.blink.sh/basics/hosts">configured your host</a> and installed the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=BlinkShellInc.blink-fs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" aria-selected="false">blink-fs</a> extension on the target, just type:</p>
<pre><code dir="ltr">code &lt;host&gt;:&lt;path/to/project&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Please make sure the host has all the authentication information in settings (like passwords), as to work, the connection must be non-interactive. You can check out the logs by doing <code dir="ltr">cat .blink/blinkCode.log</code> to identify issues.</p>
<p>If you have enabled <a href="https://docs.blink.sh/advanced/files-app">Files.app integration</a> for the host, there is an even easier way to launch code. Just long-press the project directory or file, and tap <code dir="ltr">Code</code>!</p>
<p><span><span></span><img alt="img" srcset="https://docs.blink.sh/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fcode-filesapp.5ff8a70e.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://docs.blink.sh/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fcode-filesapp.5ff8a70e.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" loading="lazy" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></span></p>
<h2 id="code-in-the-cloud">Code in the Cloud</h2>
<p>Blink Code can also connect to your instance of Code Server, offering the same premium experience so you can be more productive. To do so, just copy the URL of the running code instance and use it as the parameter, like such:</p>
<pre><code dir="ltr">code https://gitpod.dev/asdfqwerzxcv
</code></pre>
<p>Note there are iOS limitations on the domains we can access (we are working on that). We currently support domains for GitHub Codespaces, GitPod, and Code-Server. If your Code instance is accessed through a private IP, we suggest you <a href="https://docs.blink.sh/advanced/advanced-ssh#tunnels">open a tunnel</a> so access happens through localhost instead.</p>
<p><strong>PRO TIP:</strong> Blink will also capture <code dir="ltr">vscode://</code> routes, so it can fulfill the <em>Open in Desktop</em> functionality, for example, in GitHub Codespaces.</p>
<p><span><span></span><img alt="img" srcset="https://docs.blink.sh/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fcode-link.60b46e61.png&amp;w=1080&amp;q=75 1x, https://docs.blink.sh/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fcode-link.60b46e61.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://docs.blink.sh/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fcode-link.60b46e61.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" loading="lazy" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></span></p>
<h2 id="code-from-github-repositories">Code from GitHub repositories</h2>
<p>You can use Blink Code to quickly browse and edit your code in GitHub repositories. This is perfect when you need to do a quick fix or edit a blog or webpage, committing back changes once you are done.</p>
<p>On the bottom-left corner, tap the <code dir="ltr">&gt;&lt;</code> button, and select "Open Remote Repository". Note you may have to log in to GitHub to access your repositories.</p>
<h2>Tips &amp; Tricks</h2>
<h2 id="exploring-vscode">Exploring VSCode</h2>
<p>If you wish to explore VSCode in more depth, documentation abounds on how it works and what you can do with it. You can get started with the <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" aria-selected="false">VSCode official documentation</a>.</p>
<h2 id="on-screen-keyboard">On-Screen keyboard</h2>
<p>Blink Code offers the same on-screen keyboard as the terminal. When you play with it, please notice that special key modifiers like <code dir="ltr">Ctrl</code>, <code dir="ltr">Cmd</code> and <code dir="ltr">Meta</code> are integrated inside Blink Code too. Try it opening the Command Palette using <code dir="ltr">Cmd-m</code>. We promise this will take your experience to the next level!</p>
<h2 id="keyboard-shortcuts">Keyboard Shortcuts</h2>
<p>Blink Shell makes heavy use of keyboard shortcuts for navigation. Some of these may suppress VSCode keyboard shortcuts that you may deem necessary for your workflow. If so, you can easily reconfigure any by following <a href="https://docs.blink.sh/basics/customize#blink-shortcuts">Blink Shortcuts</a>.</p>
<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
<ul>
<li>If VS Code is not loading at all or it is showing a blank screen, try closing the tab and starting <code dir="ltr">code</code> again. Also, try closing Blink and reopening it.<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Try using the --vscode-url parameter, like this: <code dir="ltr">code —vscode-url vscode.dev</code>. Then try to reload without it.</li>
<li>Try using the same URL with Safari (and if using just <code dir="ltr">code .</code>, use <code dir="ltr">vscode.dev</code>) under the same device. This may show if the device has some problems loading the URL. If Safari loaded, try to run the command again under Blink.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Make sure the Blink-FS extension is installed and enabled. In order to use SFTP this extension is very important as seen in this <a href="https://github.com/blinksh/blink/issues/1304" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" aria-selected="false">Discussion</a>.</li>
<li>If you have issues enabling Blink-FS, or getting the extensions to come through, <a href="https://vscode.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" aria-selected="false">https://vscode.dev</a> may be having problems. In those cases, we have seen that changing to the Nightly version may work, as suggested in this <a href="https://github.com/blinksh/blink/discussions/1795#discussioncomment-6262467" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" aria-selected="false">Discussion</a>.</li>
<li>Make sure SFTP is enabled in the remote, and that authentication requires no user input (like passwords or 2FA). One good test for this is to <a href="https://docs.blink.sh/advanced/files-app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" aria-selected="false">enable the Files.app integration</a> and browsing files there, as pointed out in this <a href="https://github.com/blinksh/blink/issues/1880" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" aria-selected="false">Discussion</a>.</li>
<li>Make sure your remote path is valid. Try accessing your home folder with <code dir="ltr">code &lt;host&gt;:~/</code>. Then try using the Files.app integration, navigate to the folder you want to work on, long tap on it and <code dir="ltr">Open in Code</code>. This will automatically complete the paths for you and will allow you to see how it is accessed in the remote.</li>
<li>Check logs <code dir="ltr">~/.blink/blinkCode.log</code>. This may give you a clue of where things stopped.</li>
<li>Send a support request with the logs to <a href="https://github.com/blinksh/blink/discussions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" aria-selected="false">Github Discussions</a>, create your <code dir="ltr">New discussion</code> under the <code dir="ltr">Support</code> category.</li>
