            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://deno.com/blog/deno-v-oracle2">https://deno.com/blog/deno-v-oracle2</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42939940">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Yesterday, Oracle filed
<a href="https://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?pno=92086835&amp;pty=CAN&amp;eno=7" rel="noopener noreferrer">a motion to dismiss</a>
in response to Deno’s petition to cancel its “JavaScript” trademark. But instead
of addressing the real issue—that JavaScript is an open standard with multiple
independent implementations—Oracle is trying to stall the process and sidestep
accountability.</p>
<h2 id="recap">Recap</h2>
<p>Two years ago, I published <a href="https://tinyclouds.org/trademark" rel="noopener noreferrer">a blog post</a>
asking Oracle to release the JavaScript trademark as a goodwill gesture. That
got no response.</p>
<p>Last September, I published <a href="https://javascript.tm/" rel="noopener noreferrer">an open letter</a> co-signed
by Brendan Eich (creator of JavaScript), current TC39 editors, and over 16,000
JavaScript developers. Many were shocked to learn that Oracle even claimed
ownership of JavaScript. Oracle still said nothing.</p>
<p>So last November, I filed
<a href="https://deno.com/blog/deno-v-oracle" rel="noopener noreferrer">a formal petition with the USPTO</a> through
my company, Deno, to cancel Oracle’s “JavaScript” trademark. Among other things,
we pointed out that in 2019, Oracle renewed its trademark by submitting a
screenshot of the Node.js website—a project I created—as proof of use, despite
having no affiliation with it.</p>
<p>Our petition challenges Oracle’s trademark on three grounds:</p>
<ul>
<li>Genericness – JavaScript is a widely used programming language, not an Oracle
product.</li>
<li>Abandonment – Oracle does not control, maintain, or enforce the trademark.</li>
<li>Fraud on the USPTO – Oracle submitted misleading evidence in its renewal
filing.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can read the full peititon for cancellation
<a href="https://deno.com/blog/deno-v-oracle/petition-for-cancellation.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="oracles-defense-that-specimen-just-ignore-it">Oracle’s defense: “That specimen? Just ignore it”</h2>
<p><a href="https://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?pno=92086835&amp;pty=CAN&amp;eno=7" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle has finally responded</a>—but
only to the fraud claim. Their argument: <em>Yes, we used a screenshot from
Node.js, but it doesn’t matter because we also submitted another specimen.</em></p>
<p>Here’s how they frame our petition in their filing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The Petition ignores completely that Oracle submitted two specimens.
Moreover, on its face, the Petition fails to allege a claim of fraud as to the
renewal in Class 42 because the specimen it touts as ‘fraudulent’ was
submitted to support only the renewal in Class 9 and not Class 42.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oracle’s JavaScript trademark covers both software products (Class 9) and
technology services (Class 42). Their argument is that the Node.js screenshot
was only for Class 9 and that their primary specimen—an Oracle JET page—was
sufficient for both.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Petitioner has not challenged and could not plausibly challenge the
JAVASCRIPT Extension Toolkit page from Oracle’s own website that Oracle
submitted as its primary specimen in Class 9 and as its only specimen in Class
42.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This raises serious questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>If Oracle’s primary specimen (a screenshot of Oracle JET) was truly
sufficient, why submit a screenshot of Node.js at all?</li>
<li>Oracle JET isn’t even a standalone JavaScript runtime—it’s a UI toolkit.</li>
<li>Has anyone even used Oracle JET, or is it just there to keep the trademark
alive?</li>
<li>Oracle never explained why it used a screenshot from a project it had no
connection to.</li>
</ul>
<p>They even go as far as saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Oracle does not concede that submission of the Node.js Specimen was improper.
However, the Board need not address that question in connection with this
Motion.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oracle isn’t denying that it used my project—it’s just arguing that it doesn’t
matter. If a company misrepresents something in a legal filing, you’d expect
them to acknowledge it. But Oracle hasn’t even addressed it. No apology. No
explanation. Just an attempt to move past it as if nothing happened.</p>
<p>I created Node.js and released it under the MIT license to benefit developers,
not so it could be used as a legal pawn by a Fortune 500 company. Now, instead
of correcting their misrepresentation, they’re using it to stall the case.</p>
<p><img src="https://deno.com/blog/deno-v-oracle2/specimens.png" alt="Specimens used in 2019 renewal" title=""></p>
<h2 id="delaying-the-process">Delaying the process</h2>
<p>Oracle waited until the deadline to file this motion, delaying their response to
the real issue: whether “JavaScript” is a generic term.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“This motion tolls the deadline to otherwise answer the Petition, and Oracle
requests that the Board reset the answer deadline to at least 30 days after
the date of its decision on this motion.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oracle won’t even discuss whether “JavaScript” should remain a trademark until
they’ve finished dragging out this fraud claim.</p>
<p>This legal maneuvering puts us in a difficult position:</p>
<ol>
<li>Agree to drop the fraud claim, letting them get away with misrepresenting
their trademark renewal.</li>
<li>Spend months fighting this procedural issue before even getting to the real
debate.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-real-issue">The real issue</h2>
<p>The situation is self-evident to anyone working in tech: Oracle did not create
JavaScript. Oracle does not control JavaScript. Oracle should not own the
trademark for JavaScript.</p>
<p>JavaScript is defined by an open specification (ECMA-262), maintained by TC39,
an industry group with representatives from Google, Apple, Microsoft, Mozilla,
and others. The major implementations of JavaScript are in the browsers built by
Mozilla, Google, Apple, and Microsoft. Oracle has no role in JavaScript’s
governance, implementation, or evolution—yet it continues to wield this
trademark as a legal cudgel.</p>
<p>This isn’t just about JavaScript. If Oracle can hold onto this trademark, what
does that say about the trademark system as a whole? Should corporations be able
to warehouse trademarks indefinitely, even when they play no meaningful role in
the things they claim to own? Even when they commit fraud to maintain them?</p>
<p>A company with no role in JavaScript’s past or future has no right to control
its name.</p>
<h2 id="how-you-can-help">How you can help</h2>
<ul>
<li>Share this post and spread awareness about Oracle’s trademark claim.</li>
<li>Sign the open letter at <a href="https://javascript.tm/" rel="noopener noreferrer">javascript.tm</a></li>
<li>If you’re a journalist, reach out—I’m happy to talk.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let one thing be clear: we are not intimidated by Oracle’s legal maneuvering,
and we will continue to fight this case on it’s very strong merits. You can

            <guid>42938409</guid>
            <pubDate>Tue, 04 Feb 2025 20:49:58 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.seangoedecke.com/how-i-use-llms/">https://www.seangoedecke.com/how-i-use-llms/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42938409">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Software engineers are deeply split on the subject of large language models. Many believe they’re the most transformative technology to ever hit the industry. Others believe they’re the latest in a long line of hype-only products: exciting to think about, but ultimately not useful to professionals trying to do serious work.</p>
<p>Personally, I feel like I get a lot of value from AI. I think many of the people who don’t feel this way are “holding it wrong”: i.e. they’re not using language models in the most helpful ways. In this post, I’m going to list a bunch of ways I regularly use AI in my day-to-day as a staff engineer.</p>
<h2>Writing production code</h2>
<p>I use Copilot completions every time I write code<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>. Almost all the completions I accept are complete boilerplate (filling out function arguments or types, for instance). It’s rare that I let Copilot produce business logic for me, but it does occasionally happen. In my areas of expertise (Ruby on Rails, for instance), I’m confident I can do better work than the LLM. It’s just a (very good) autocomplete.</p>
<p>However, I’m not always working in my areas of expertise. I frequently find myself making small tactical changes in less-familiar areas (for instance, a Golang service or a C library). I know the syntax and have written personal projects in these languages, but I’m less confident about what’s idiomatic. In these cases, I rely on Copilot more. Typically I’ll use Copilot chat with the o1 model enabled, paste in my code, and ask directly “is this idiomatic C?”</p>
<p>Relying more on the LLM like this is risky, because I don’t know what I’m missing. It basically lets me operate at a smart-intern baseline across the board. I have to also behave like a sensible intern, and make sure a subject-matter expert in the area reviews the change for me. But even with that caveat, I think it’s very high-leverage to be able to make these kinds of tactical changes quickly.</p>
<h2>Writing throwaway code</h2>
<p>I am much more liberal with my use of LLMs when I’m writing code that will never see production. For instance, I recently did a block of research which required pulling chunks of public data from an API, classifying it, and approximating that classification with a series of quick regexes. All of this code was run on my laptop only, and I used LLMs to write basically all of it: the code to pull the data, the code to run a separate LLM to classify it, the code to tokenize it and measure token frequencies and score them, and so on.</p>
<p>LLMs excel at writing code that works that doesn’t have to be maintained. Non-production code that’s only run once (e.g. for research) is a perfect fit for this. I would say that my use of LLMs here meant I got this done 2x-4x faster than if I’d been unassisted. </p>
<h2>Learning new domains</h2>
<p>Probably the most useful thing I do with LLMs is use it as a tutor-on-demand for learning new domains. For instance, last weekend I learned the basics of Unity, relying heavily on ChatGPT-4o. The magic of learning with LLMs is that you can <em>ask questions</em>: not just “how does X work”, but follow-up questions like “how does X relate to Y”. Even more usefully, you can ask “is this right” questions. I often write up something I think I’ve learned and feed it back to the LLM, which points out where I’m right and where I’m still misunderstanding. I ask the LLM <em>a lot</em> of questions.</p>
<p>I take a lot of notes when I’m learning something new. Being able to just copy-paste all my notes in and get them reviewed by the LLM is great.</p>
<p>What about hallucinations? Honestly, since GPT-3.5, I haven’t noticed ChatGPT or Claude doing a lot of hallucinating. Most of the areas I’m trying to learn about are very well-understood (just not by me), and in my experience that means the chance of a hallucination is pretty low. I’ve never run into a case where I learned something from a LLM that turned out to be fundamentally wrong or hallucinated.</p>
<h2>Last resort bug fixes</h2>
<p>I don’t do this a lot, but sometimes when I’m really stuck on a bug, I’ll attach the entire file or files to Copilot chat, paste the error message, and just ask “can you help?”</p>
<p>The reason I don’t do this is that I think I’m currently much better at bug-hunting than current AI models. Almost all the time, Copilot (or Claude, for some personal projects) just gets confused. But it’s still worth a try if I’m genuinely stuck, just in case, because it’s so low-effort. I remember two or three cases where I’d just missed some subtle behaviour that the LLM caught, saving me a lot of time.</p>
<p>Because LLMs aren’t that good at this yet, I don’t spend a lot of time iterating or trying to un-stick the LLM. I just try once to see if it can get it.</p>
<h2>Proofreading for typos and logic mistakes</h2>
<p>I write a fair amount of English documents: ADRs, technical summaries, internal posts, and so on. I <strong>never</strong> allow the LLM to write these for me. Part of that is that I think I can write more clearly than current LLMs. Part of it is my general distaste for the ChatGPT house style.</p>
<p>What I do occasionally do is feed a draft into the LLM and ask for feedback. LLMs are great at catching typos, and will sometimes raise an interesting point that becomes an edit to my draft.</p>
<p>Like bugfixing, I don’t iterate when I’m doing this - I just ask for one round of feedback. Usually the LLM offers some stylistic feedback, which I always ignore.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>I use LLMs for these tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Smart autocomplete with Copilot</li>
<li>Short tactical changes in areas I don’t know well (always reviewed by a SME)</li>
<li>Writing lots of use-once-and-throwaway research code</li>
<li>Asking lots of questions to learn about new topics (e.g. the Unity game engine)</li>
<li>Last-resort bugfixes, just in case it can figure it out immediately</li>
<li>Big-picture proofreading for long-form English communication</li>
</ul>
<p>I don’t use LLMs for these tasks (yet):</p>
<ul>
<li>Writing whole PRs for me in areas I’m familiar with</li>
<li>Writing ADRs or other technical communications</li>
<li>Research in large codebases and finding out how things are done</li>
</ul>

<p>Code updates to a government database that helps track whether a federal program to get children ready for school at age five is actually working show software engineers are purging it of references to "forbidden words" related to DEI.</p><p>The updates, shown in Github commits, are to a database for the Department of Health and Human Services’ Head Start program. They show a project called “<a href="https://github.com/HHS/Head-Start-TTADP/commit/d33953e0fc267970203a0ef41bb2e81398ca6ab0?ref=404media.co" rel="noreferrer">Remove-DEI</a>,” which reveal some of the back-and-forth that is happening behind the scenes to align federal agencies with Donald Trump’s executive orders that forbid almost anything having to do with race or gender within federal agencies. The Github pages show software engineers discussing amongst themselves how to best remove all instances of “forbidden words” from a specific database, and the code updates they used to do it. The changes also show that, while thousands of government datasets are disappearing from the internet, even ones that remain are having parts of their utility deprecated or broken in a way that may not be visible to those outside the government.</p><p>The <a href="https://headstart.gov/about-us/article/about-office-head-start?ref=404media.co"><u>Office of Head Start</u></a> is a government agency that spends roughly $12 billion per year to get families and children between birth and age five ready to succeed in schools, with a special focus on providing and administering grants to groups that provide assistance for “America’s most vulnerable young children.” Head Start centers <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/01/28/nation/trump-administration-federal-loan-freezes-head-start/?ref=404media.co"><u>were briefly impacted by Trump’s spending freeze</u></a>, leading centers to worry about making payroll.&nbsp;</p><div><p>💡</p><p><b><strong>Are you a federal worker or contractor? Using a non-work device, you can message me securely on Signal at +1 202 505 1702. Otherwise, send me an email at jason@404media.co.</strong></b></p></div><p>The changes show that the U.S. government or people working on its behalf are not just manually deleting references to diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEIA) but are also writing and tweaking code to remove references to DEI in a more blunt-force way. The HHS change is emblematic of hundreds that 404 Media has reviewed in recent days.

A description of the change explained on Github reads “Review the option for equity: Removal of the equity topic from the topic drop down, removal of the equity topic from all filters, Removal of the DEIA standard goal, ‘Families affected by systemic discrimination/bias/exclusion’ removes as a target population.”&nbsp;</p><p>The coder also explains that they tweaked how topics are filtered in the database as a way of “making sure that when we mark a topic as deleted, it is removed from all the relevant places.”&nbsp;</p><p>The coder asked their colleagues to “confirm equity has been removed from the places above. I ask also that you scan the website for other places where we need to remove the forbidden words.” The code was written by employees at a company called Ad Hoc LLC, a government contractor that works with HHS on the database. Ad Hoc is being <a href="https://www.usaspending.gov/award/CONT_AWD_75ACF124F80009_7590_GS35F392DA_4732?ref=404media.co"><u>paid $7.2 million to manage the database</u></a>, according to federal records.</p><p>Ad Hoc was created in the aftermath of the HealthCare.gov launch debacle, and describes itself as “a digital services company that helps the federal government better serve people.” Ad Hoc declined to comment. </p><p>HHS told 404 Media that it is not allowed to comment: "HHS has issued a pause on mass communications and public appearances that are not directly related to emergencies or critical to preserving health. This is a short pause to allow the new team to set up a process for review and prioritization. There are exceptions for announcements that HHS divisions believe are mission critical, but they will be made on a case-by-case basis.”</p><figure><a href="https://www.404media.co/archivists-work-to-identify-and-save-the-thousands-of-datasets-disappearing-from-data-gov/"><div><p>Archivists Work to Identify and Save the Thousands of Datasets Disappearing From Data.gov</p><p>More than 2,000 datasets have disappeared from data.gov since Trump was inaugurated.

If you don’t, message us! We’d love to know how we could make this clearer.</p> <h3 id="why-should-you-care">Why should you care?</h3> <p>Three or four years ago, I don’t think most ML researchers would have needed to understand any of this. But today even “small” models run so close to hardware limits that doing novel research requires you to think about efficiency at scale.<d-footnote>Historically, ML research has followed something of a tick-tock cycle between systems innovations and software improvements. Alex Krizhevsky had to write unholy CUDA code to make CNNs fast but within a couple years, libraries like Theano and TensorFlow meant you didn't have to. Maybe that will happen here too and everything in this book will be abstracted away in a few years. But scaling laws have pushed our models perpetually to the very frontier of our hardware, and it seems likely that, in the near future, doing cutting edge research will be inextricably tied to an understanding of how to efficiently scale models to large hardware topologies.</d-footnote> <strong>A 20% win on benchmarks is irrelevant if it comes at a 20% cost to roofline efficiency.</strong> Promising model architectures routinely fail either because they <em>can’t</em> run efficiently at scale or because no one puts in the work to make them do so.</p> <p><strong>The goal of “model scaling” is to be able to increase the number of chips used for training or inference while achieving a proportional, linear increase in throughput.</strong> This is known as “<em>strong scaling</em>”. Although adding additional chips (“parallelism”) usually decreases the computation time, it also comes at the cost of added communication between chips. When communication takes longer than computation we become “communication bound” and cannot scale strongly.<d-footnote>As your computation time decreases, you also typically face bottlenecks at the level of a single chip. Your shiny new TPU or GPU may be rated to perform 500 trillion operations-per-second, but if you aren't careful it can just as easily do a tenth of that if it's bogged down moving parameters around in memory. The interplay of per-chip computation, memory bandwidth, and total memory is critical to the scaling story.</d-footnote> If we understand our hardware well enough to anticipate where these bottlenecks will arise, we can design or reconfigure our models to avoid them.<d-footnote>Hardware designers face the inverse problem: building hardware that provides just enough compute, bandwidth, and memory for our algorithms while minimizing cost. You can imagine how stressful this "co-design" problem is: you have to bet on what algorithms will look like when the first chips actually become available, often 2 to 3 years down the road. The story of the TPU is a resounding success in this game. Matrix multiplication is a unique algorithm in the sense that it uses far more FLOPs per byte of memory than almost any other (N FLOPs per byte), and early TPUs and their systolic array architecture achieved far better perf / $ than GPUs did at the time they were built. TPUs were designed for ML workloads, and GPUs with their TensorCores are rapidly changing to fill this niche as well. But you can imagine how costly it would have been if neural networks had not taken off, or had changed in some fundamental way that TPUs (which are inherently less flexible than GPUs) could not handle.</d-footnote></p> <p><em>Our goal in this book is to explain how TPU (and GPU) hardware works and how the Transformer architecture has evolved to perform well on current hardware. We hope this will be useful both for researchers designing new architectures and for engineers working to make the current generation of LLMs run fast.</em></p> <h2 id="high-level-outline">High-Level Outline</h2> <p>The overall structure of this book is as follows:</p> <p><a href="https://jax-ml.github.io/scaling-book/roofline">Section 1</a> explains roofline analysis and what factors can limit our ability to scale (communication, computation, and memory). <a href="https://jax-ml.github.io/scaling-book/tpus">Section 2</a> and <a href="https://jax-ml.github.io/scaling-book/sharding">Section 3</a> talk in detail about how TPUs and modern GPUs work, both as individual chips and — of critical importance — as an interconnected system with inter-chip links of limited bandwidth and latency. We’ll answer questions like:</p> <ul> <li>How long should a matrix multiply of a certain size take? At what point is it bound by compute or by memory or communication bandwidth?</li> <li>How are TPUs wired together to form training clusters? How much bandwidth does each part of the system have?</li> <li>How long does it take to gather, scatter, or re-distribute arrays across multiple TPUs?</li> <li>How do we efficiently multiply matrices that are distributed differently across devices?</li> </ul> <figure> <picture> <source srcset="https://jax-ml.github.io/scaling-book/assets/img/pointwise-product-480.webp 480w,https://jax-ml.github.io/scaling-book/assets/img/pointwise-product-800.webp 800w,https://jax-ml.github.io/scaling-book/assets/img/pointwise-product-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"> <img src="https://jax-ml.github.io/scaling-book/assets/img/pointwise-product.gif" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> <figcaption><b>Figure:</b> a diagram from <a href="https://jax-ml.github.io/scaling-book/tpus">Section 2</a> showing how a TPU performs an elementwise product. Depending on the size of our arrays and the bandwidth of various links, we can find ourselves compute-bound (using the full hardware compute capacity) or comms-bound (bottlenecked by memory loading).</figcaption> </figure> <p>Five years ago ML had a colorful landscape of architectures — ConvNets, LSTMs, MLPs, Transformers — but now we mostly just have the Transformer<d-cite key="transformers"></d-cite>. We strongly believe it’s worth understanding every piece of the Transformer architecture: the exact sizes of every matrix, where normalization occurs, how many parameters and FLOPs<d-footnote>FLoating point OPs, basically the total number of adds and multiplies required. While many sources take FLOPs to mean "operations per second", we use FLOPs/s to indicate that explicitly.</d-footnote> are in each part. <a href="https://jax-ml.github.io/scaling-book/transformers">Section 4</a> goes through this “Transformer math” carefully, showing how to count the parameters and FLOPs for both training and inference. This tells us how much memory our model will use, how much time we’ll spend on compute or comms, and when attention will become important relative to the feed-forward blocks.</p> <figure> <picture> <source srcset="https://jax-ml.github.io/scaling-book/assets/img/transformer-diagram-480.webp 480w,https://jax-ml.github.io/scaling-book/assets/img/transformer-diagram-800.webp 800w,https://jax-ml.github.io/scaling-book/assets/img/transformer-diagram-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"> <img src="https://jax-ml.github.io/scaling-book/assets/img/transformer-diagram.png" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> <figcaption><b>Figure:</b> a standard Transformer layer with each matrix multiplication (matmul) shown as a dot inside a circle.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>TikTok, a widely used social media platform with over a billion active users worldwide, has become a key source of news, particularly for younger audiences. This growing influence has raised concerns about potential political biases in its recommendation algorithm, especially during election cycles. A <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17831">recent preprint study</a> examined this issue by analyzing how TikTok’s algorithm recommends political content ahead of the 2024 presidential election. Using a controlled experiment involving hundreds of simulated user accounts, the study found that Republican-leaning accounts received significantly more ideologically aligned content than Democratic-leaning accounts, while Democratic-leaning accounts were more frequently exposed to opposing viewpoints.</p><p>TikTok has become a major force among social media platforms, boasting over a billion monthly active users worldwide and 170 million in the United States. It has also emerged as a significant source of news, particularly for younger demographics. This has raised concerns about the platform’s <a href="https://www.psypost.org/algorithmic-manipulation-tiktok-use-predicts-positive-views-of-chinas-human-rights-record/">potential to shape political narratives</a> and influence elections.</p><p>Despite these concerns, there has been limited research investigating <a href="https://www.psypost.org/does-tiktok-really-cause-brain-rot-new-study-links-short-video-addiction-to-brain-abnormalities/">TikTok</a>‘s recommendation algorithm for political biases, especially in comparison to extensive research on other social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, X (formerly Twitter), and Reddit.</p><p>“We previously conducted experiments auditing YouTube’s recommendation algorithms. This study published at <a href="https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/2/8/pgad264/7242446"><em>PNAS Nexus</em></a> demonstrated that the algorithm <a href="https://www.psypost.org/youtubes-recommendation-system-exhibits-left-leaning-bias-new-study-suggests/">exhibited a left-leaning bias</a> in the United States,” said <a href="https://yasirzaki.net/">Yasir Zaki</a>, an assistant professor of computer science at New York University Abu Dhabi.</p><p>“Given TikTok’s widespread popularity—particularly among younger demographics—we sought to replicate this study on TikTok during the 2024 U.S. presidential elections. Another motivation was the concerns over TikTok’s Chinese ownership led many U.S. politicians to advocate for banning the platform, citing fears that its recommendation algorithm could be used to promote a political agenda.”</p><p>To examine how TikTok’s algorithm recommends political content, the researchers designed an extensive audit experiment. They created 323 “sock puppet” accounts—fake accounts programmed to simulate user behavior—across three politically diverse states: Texas, New York, and Georgia. Each account was assigned a political leaning: Democratic, Republican, or neutral (the control group).</p><p>The experiment consisted of two stages: a conditioning stage and a recommendation stage. In the conditioning stage, the Democratic accounts watched up to 400 Democratic-aligned videos, and the Republican accounts watched up to 400 Republican-aligned videos. Neutral accounts skipped this stage. This was done to “teach” TikTok’s algorithm the political preferences of each account.</p><p>In the recommendation stage, all accounts watched videos on TikTok’s “For You” page, which is the platform’s main feed of recommended content. The accounts watched 10 videos, followed by a one-hour pause, and repeated this process for six days. Each experimental run lasted one week. The researchers collected data on approximately 394,000 videos viewed by these accounts between April 30th and November 11th, 2024.</p><p>To analyze the political content of the recommended videos, the researchers downloaded the English transcripts of videos when available (22.8% of unique videos). They then used a system involving three large language models—GPT-4o, Gemini-Pro, and GPT-4—to classify each video. The language models answered questions about whether the video was political, whether it concerned the 2024 U.S. elections or major political figures, and what the ideological stance of the video was (pro-Democratic, anti-Democratic, pro-Republican, anti-Republican, or neutral). The majority vote of the three language models was used as the final classification for each question.</p><p>The analysis uncovered significant asymmetries in content distribution on TikTok. Republican-seeded accounts received approximately 11.8% more party-aligned recommendations compared to Democratic-seeded accounts. Democratic-seeded accounts were exposed to approximately 7.5% more opposite-party recommendations on average. These differences were consistent across all three states and could not be explained by differences in engagement metrics like likes, views, shares, comments, or followers.</p><p>“We found that TikTok’s recommendation algorithm was not neutral during the 2024 U.S. presidential elections,” explained <a href="https://www.trahwan.com/">Talal Rahwan</a>, an associate professor of computer science at New York University Abu Dhabi. “Across all three states analyzed in our study, the platform consistently promoted more Republican-leaning content. We showed that this bias cannot be explained by factors such as video popularity and engagement metrics—key variables that typically influence recommendation algorithms.”</p><p>Further analysis showed that the bias was primarily driven by negative partisanship content, meaning content that criticizes the opposing party rather than promoting one’s own party. Both Democratic- and Republican-conditioned accounts were recommended more negative partisan content, but this was more pronounced for Republican accounts. Negative-partisanship videos were 1.78 times more likely to be recommended as an ideological mismatch relative to positive-partisanship ones.</p><p>“We observed a bias toward negative partisanship in TikTok’s recommendations,” Zaki noted. “Regardless of the political party—Democratic or Republican—the algorithm prioritized content that criticized the opposing party over content that promoted one’s own party.”</p><p>The researchers also examined the top Democratic and Republican channels on TikTok by follower count. Republican channels had a significantly higher mismatch proportion, meaning their videos were more likely to be recommended to accounts with an opposite political leaning. Notably, videos from Donald Trump’s official TikTok channel were recommended to Democratic-conditioned accounts nearly 27% of the time, while Kamala Harris’s videos were recommended to Republican-conditioned accounts only 15.3% of the time.</p><p>Finally, the researchers analyzed the topics covered in partisan videos. Topics stereotypically associated with the Democratic party, like climate change and abortion, were more frequently covered by Democratic-aligned videos. Topics like immigration, foreign policy, and the Ukraine war were more frequently covered by Republican-aligned videos. Videos on immigration, crime, the Gaza conflict, and foreign policy were most likely to be recommended as ideological mismatches to Democratic-conditioned accounts.</p><p>To build on this work, future research could explore how TikTok’s algorithm behaves across different election cycles, investigate how misinformation is distributed within partisan content, and compare TikTok’s political content recommendations with those of other major platforms. Additionally, studies incorporating real user data alongside automated experiments could provide a more comprehensive understanding of how individuals experience political content on TikTok. Given the platform’s growing role in shaping public discourse, continued scrutiny of its recommendation system will be essential for assessing its impact on political knowledge and voter decision-making.</p><p>“We want to address fundamental questions about the neutrality of social media platforms,” Rahwan said.</p><p>The study, “<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2501.17831v1">TikTok’s recommendations skewed towards Republican content during the 2024 U.S. presidential race</a>,” was authored by Hazem Ibrahim, HyunSeok Daniel Jang, Nouar Aldahoul, Aaron R. Kaufman, Talal Rahwan, and Yasir Zaki.</p></div></div>]]></description>

In contrast, Lofi musicians take inspiration from Nujabes’ recordings by deliberately dirtying up their beats and productions, as if they were created on the limited hardware of bygone days.</p><p>As listeners began to burn out from the hard-hitting EDM of the Dubstep era, Lofi Hip Hop became the perfect respite: A chilled out, upbeat style of music roughly half the tempo of the dance music that preceded it.</p><p>Suddenly, you didn’t have to have hyper polished vocals, impeccable recordings, or meticulously edited synth lines to create a song that would attract thousands or millions of listeners.</p><p><strong>Bedroom producers now had an advantage.</strong></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F05d65d78-c733-4e6c-af1b-d113d572b372_956x780.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F05d65d78-c733-4e6c-af1b-d113d572b372_956x780.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F05d65d78-c733-4e6c-af1b-d113d572b372_956x780.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F05d65d78-c733-4e6c-af1b-d113d572b372_956x780.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F05d65d78-c733-4e6c-af1b-d113d572b372_956x780.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F05d65d78-c733-4e6c-af1b-d113d572b372_956x780.png" width="956" height="780" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/05d65d78-c733-4e6c-af1b-d113d572b372_956x780.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:780,&quot;width&quot;:956,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Lofi producer Wish on the Beat records a guitar line for one of her productions&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="Lofi producer Wish on the Beat records a guitar line for one of her productions" title="Lofi producer Wish on the Beat records a guitar line for one of her productions" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F05d65d78-c733-4e6c-af1b-d113d572b372_956x780.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F05d65d78-c733-4e6c-af1b-d113d572b372_956x780.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F05d65d78-c733-4e6c-af1b-d113d572b372_956x780.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F05d65d78-c733-4e6c-af1b-d113d572b372_956x780.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Wish on the Beat recording a guitar line for one of her productions</figcaption></figure></div><p>They could play whatever instrument they knew, set it to a mellow drum beat, and surround it with a modest production.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="file-rewrite-md" tabindex="0" role="region" aria-label="file-rewrite-md">
    <article itemprop="text"><p dir="auto">This may become a blog post or FAQ entry or something. For now, I'm just writing up something to answer the questions I've gotten about it!</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 dir="auto">Rewriting a Language's Compiler in Itself</h2><a id="user-content-rewriting-a-languages-compiler-in-itself" aria-label="Permalink: Rewriting a Language's Compiler in Itself" href="#rewriting-a-languages-compiler-in-itself"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Scratch-rewriting a code base in a different language is usually considered a risky move that often leads to failure. In the case of compilers, it's the reverse; most successful compilers (e.g. Java, C++, C, C#, TypeScript, Scala, Go, Rust, Zig, OCaml, Haskell, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-hosting_(compilers)#List_of_languages_having_self-hosting_compilers" rel="nofollow">many others</a>) have undergone a complete scratch-rewrite...in themselves. This process is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-hosting_(compilers)" rel="nofollow">self-hosting</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">We can break down the observation that self-hosting has a long track record of success into two pieces:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>It's normal for a successful language's compiler to be rewritten from scratch in a different language.</li>
<li>It's normal for the different language to be the target language itself.</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">Rewrites do more than just change the code base to a more appealing language. They're an opportunity to start fresh, with all the wisdom gained from the first version—to discard accumulated cruft and to avoid mistakes from the last time around (while naturally making some new mistakes). They're also notorious for causing regressions, especially in edge-case functionality. Fortunately, we've been very consistent about communicating that Roc is not stable and is going to be changing—which is the main reason we've chosen not to have a numbered release yet.</p>
<p dir="auto">All of those tradeoffs are true about rewrites, regardless of target language. When Java's compiler got rewritten in Java, and Haskell's compiler got rewritten in Haskell, their target languages were very different—but the benefits of starting fresh and using accumulated knowledge on the rewritten version applied to both. Clearly, if you want to join in the long tradition of successful compilers that have been rewritten at some point, you can pick whatever target language suits you.</p>
<p dir="auto">Roc's compiler has always been written in Rust, and we do not plan to self-host. We have <a href="https://www.roc-lang.org/faq#self-hosted-compiler" rel="nofollow">a FAQ entry</a> explaining why, and none of our reasoning has changed on that subject.</p>
<p dir="auto">However, we have decided to do a scratch-rewrite in a different language—namely, Zig. We're very excited about it!</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 dir="auto">Why now?</h2><a id="user-content-why-now" aria-label="Permalink: Why now?" href="#why-now"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">We recently realized that our roadmap included independently rewriting almost every single part of Roc's 300K-lines-of-Rust compiler (type inference was the only exception) for unrelated reasons. More specifically:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>The parser is not as error-tolerant as we want it to be, and separately we want to rearchitect it because the grammar has evolved to the point where a different foundational parsing strategy makes sense. While we're at it, we also want to convert it to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_descent_parser" rel="nofollow">recursive descent</a>; it was originally written using <a href="https://bodil.lol/parser-combinators/" rel="nofollow">parser combinators</a> because that was what I was comfortable with at the time. Josh had already been experimenting with a rewrite in the existing Rust code base.</li>
<li>The formatter doesn't support enforcing line width. We only want to enable the line-length enforcement for docs generation, but we do want it, and switching to a system that is capable of enforcing line length (e.g. one based on Wadler's famous <a href="https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/prettier/prettier.pdf" rel="nofollow">A prettier printer</a> technique) requires a full rewrite. We'd agreed that this was what we wanted to do, although nobody had started on it.</li>
<li>Canonicalization (aka name resolution) needs to defer some name resolution to after type checking, it needs to report errors for out-of-order definitions instead of reordering them, it needs to stop using <code>Symbol</code>, and it needs to change from a recursive enum data structure to a flat array with IDs, so that we can cache it on disk efficiently. We also need to make shadowing a warning, and add support for <code>var</code>. In short, it needed a rewrite. Sam had already started on this.</li>
<li>Documentation generation doesn't resolve type aliases, or support auto-linking to docs for other types (in part because it has no awareness of other packages), or show inferred types when they weren't explicitly annotated. The changes required to address these turned out to be invasive enough that on the branch where I was fixing these issues, a rewrite was the approach I took.</li>
<li>Type inference didn't need a rewrite. It needs quite a few changes (removing lambda set inference, replacing Abilities with static dispatch, replacing opaque type wrappers with nominal tag unions, removing tuple extensibility and module params), but these were all changes we would have made incrementally. Now we'll make them all at once instead.</li>
<li>Monomorphization needs a rewrite to fix lambda sets. Specifically, it needs to be split into multiple different steps, on top of which the current implementation has accumulated so much cruft that we'd discussed a rewrite of that section just to make it easier to work on. We'd separately decided to take out the <a href="https://github.com/morphic-lang/morphic">Morphic</a> solver because the upstream dependency has become unmaintained, while having bugs and compiler performance problems that none of us are in a position to address anytime soon (because we don't understand Morphic well enough). Although Morphic's impact on the performance of compiled Roc programs has been positive, it hasn't been critical, and we decided we should revisit it only when we have the ability to address the problems we've encountered wtih it. Agus had already started on rewriting monomorphization.</li>
<li>LLVM code generation: A recurring pain point has been that we want to update to the latest <a href="https://llvm.org/" rel="nofollow">LLVM</a> version in order to get new performance improvements (and to unblock updating to the latest Zig version, which we've use for our stdlib for years), but the LLVM upgrade process has been very time-consuming in large part because of LLVM's breaking API changes. Zig came up with a way around this: compile directly to LLVM bitcode (LLVM has strong backwards-compatibility on its bitcode but not on its public-facing API) and then upgrades become trivial because we can keep our existing code generation the same. Apparently this has added about 5% to Zig's LLVM code gen times, but in the long run they (and we) can cache portions of bitcode, which can shift it to a net performance improvement compared to the status quo. Changing to use bitcode generation instead of LLVM's APIs requires a complete rewrite of LLVM code gen, and if we were to do it in Rust, we'd have to do the bitcode generation ourselves. (A Zig rewrite can reuse the existing LLVM bitcode generation logic in the Zig compiler's code base, which is MIT-licensed.)</li>
<li>Development backend: We currently do direct machine code generation (bypassing LLVM for a faster feedback loop), but now that we've seen what kind of performance that approach gets in practice, we want to try doing an interpreter instead. The theory is that the interpreter will be slower in terms of runtime performance (but not <em>that</em> much slower because of how naive our current machine code gen is), but it will improve the development feedback loop speed overall because an interpreter can skip monomorphization and code gen - going straight from type-checking to running the program. Trying out the interpreter-based approach requires actually writing an interpreter (which we separately want anyway for compile-time evaluation of constants) and then switching the development backend to use the interpreter—in other words, a rewrite.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Once we'd finished all these projects, the only stage of the compiler pipeline that wouldn't have been rewritten would have been type inference. And at the end of all that, we'd still have a Rust code base, when we'd rather have a Zig code base.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 dir="auto">Why Zig over Rust?</h2><a id="user-content-why-zig-over-rust" aria-label="Permalink: Why Zig over Rust?" href="#why-zig-over-rust"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Rust's compile times are slow. Zig's compile times are fast. This is not the only reason, but it's a big reason.</p>
<p dir="auto">Having a slow feedback loop has been a major drain on both our productivity and also our enjoyment when working on the code base. Waiting several seconds to <em>build</em> a single test, before it has even started running, is not enjoyable.</p>
<p dir="auto">A frustratingly common response I've heard to this complaint is that "several seconds is not as bad as [some other language or some other project that has minutes-long build times]!" I don't care if things could be even worse, I care that I'm feeling this pain while knowing I don't have to. Zig's x86-64 backend can reportedly scratch-build (without anything cached) the entire 300K-line Zig compiler code base in a second or two. It takes us longer than that to build one of our medium-sized Rust crates, and that's even <em>with</em> the benefit of caching.</p>
<p dir="auto">Compile times aside, the strengths and weaknesses of Rust and Zig today are much different than they were when I wrote the first line of code in Roc's Rust compiler in 2019. Back then, Rust was relatively mature and Zig was far from where it is today. (Also, I hadn't done significant low-level programming in over a decade, and didn't have confidence I would be able to manage memory correctly on my own. That has also changed.)</p>
<p dir="auto">Here are some relevant comparison points between the two languages in the specific context of Roc's compiler in 2025:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>For many projects, Rust's memory safety is a big benefit. As we've learned, Roc's compiler is not one of those projects. We tend to pass around allocators for memory management (like Zig does, and Rust does not) and their lifetimes are not complicated. We intern all of our strings early in the process, and all the other data structures are isolated to a particular stage of compilation.</li>
<li>Besides the fact that Zig is built around passing around allocators for memory management (which we want to do anyway), it also has built-in ways to make struct-of-arrays programming nicer - such as MultiArrayList. We have abstractions to do this in Rust, but they have been painful to use. We don't have experience with Zig's yet, but looking through them, they definitely seem more appealing than what we've been using in Rust.</li>
<li>Rust's large ecosystem is also a big benefit to a lot of projects. Again, Roc's compiler is not one of them. We use Inkwell, a wrapper around LLVM's APIs, but we actively would prefer to switch to Zig's direct generation of LLVM bitcode, and Zig has the only known implementation of that approach. Other than that, the few third-party Rust dependencies we use have equivalents in the Zig ecosystem. So overall, Zig's ecosystem is a selling point for us because once you filter out all the packages we have no interest in using, Zig's ecosystem has a larger absolute number of depedencies we actually want to use.</li>
<li>Zig's toolchain makes it much eaiser for us to compile statically-linked Linux binaries using musl libc, which is something we've wanted to do for a long time so that Roc can run on any distro (including Alpine in containers, which it currently can't in our Rust compiler). We know this can be done in Rust, but we also know it's easier to do in Zig. Zig's compiler itself does this, and it does so while bundling LLVM (by building it from source with musl libc), which is exactly what we need to do. Once again, we can reuse Zig code that has done exactly what we want, and there is no equivalent in the Rust ecosystem.</li>
<li>There are various miscellaneous performance optimization techniques that we've wanted to use in Rust, but haven't as much as we'd like to because they have been too painful. For example, we often want to pack some metadata into some of the bits of an index into an array. Zig lets us describe this index as a struct, where we specify what each of the bit ranges mean, and that includes arbitrary integer sizes. For example, in Rust we might store an index as a u32, but in Zig we could break that into a u27 for the actual index data (when we know the index will never need to exceed 2^27 anyway), and then we can specify that we want to use another 3 bits to store a small enumeration, and the remaining 2 bits for a pair of boolean flags. Again, these are all things we could do using Rust and bit shifts, but it's much nicer to do in Zig. Tagless unions are another Zig feature we expect to be valuable.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Did I mention compile times? I'll reiterate: compile times are a huge deal. Not only have they been painful in Rust, we also know that the fundamental unit of compilation is a crate, so we're incentivized to organize our code around what will make for faster compile times rather than what makes the most sense to us as authors. Often the boundaries end up being drawn in the same place regardless, but when those two are in tension, it's frustrating to have to sacrifice either feedback loop speed or code organization. In Zig we expect we can just have both.</p>
<p dir="auto">In summary, Rust's memory safety guarantees aren't major selling points in this particular project, whereas its slow compile times have been a major pain point for us. Rust's ecosystem is larger than Zig's overall, but after filtering out all the third-party dependencies we wouldn't use anyway, Zig has more that we actually want to use. On top of all that, Zig has some language features that we're looking forward to using, and would have used in Rust if it had them.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 dir="auto">Goals</h2><a id="user-content-goals" aria-label="Permalink: Goals" href="#goals"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">We want the scratch-rewritten compiler to be what we release as Roc 0.1.0, its first numbered release.</p>
<p dir="auto">There are several substantial language design changes planned for 0.1.0. Historically we've often implemented changes in a backwards-compatible way, but this time that wouldn't be worth it. We'll be implementing the 0.1.0 design directly.</p>
<p dir="auto">Some of the things we'd like to do to improve the reliability and correctness of the compiler:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Fuzz early. One of the things we learned when we added fuzzing to our Rust code base is that it's much easier to fix the problems fuzzing surfaces when they crop up after an incremental change. You know the problem originated with that change, even if it appears to be unrelated! The downside of maintaining this level of fuzzing early on is that it makes exploration take longer, but this is a rewrite. We've already done a ton of exploration in the Rust code base, and by now we've learned enough to have a strong sense of how we want things to work.</li>
<li>Document as we go. As with fuzzing, taking the time in the original compiler to document how everything worked would have seriously slowed down exploration. (And the docs would have needed numerous rewrites as things changed.) Documentation helps not only new contributors, but also our future selves. This time, the investment makes more sense to do up-front.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrases_from_The_Hitchhiker's_Guide_to_the_Galaxy#Don.27t_Panic" rel="nofollow">Don't panic!</a> We used things like <code>unwrap()</code> at various points in the Rust compiler when we thought it wouldn't come up in practice, and it always ended up leaking into the user experience anyway. This time, we want to do error handling exclusively by passing values around.</li>
<li>Intentionally sacrifice short-term performance for the sake of getting to a working, reliable implementation. In the Rust compiler, we made some architectural choices - most significantly, the choice to minimize the number of compiler passes - which improved performance but made it harder to debug our implementation. For this rewrite, we want to keep in mind general performance considerations like the memory layouts of the data we're storing, but we generally want to prioritize having code that's easier to understand and to debug, even if that means more compiler passes or less compact memory representations than we'd prefer to have long-term. We can investigate things like combining passes and storing IR nodes using adjacency sometime after 0.1.0.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">It's an exciting undertaking, and we're already enjoying it!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div><p><a href="https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj">Jujutsu</a> (jj), a new version control system written in Rust, has popped up on my radar a few times over the past year. Looked interesting based on a cursory look, but being actually pretty satisfied with Git, and not having major problems with it, I haven’t checked it out.</p><p>That is, until last week, when I finally decided to give it a go! I dived into a couple blog posts for a few of hours, and surprisingly (noting that we’re talking about a VCS) I found myself enjoying it a lot, seeing the consistent design, and overall simplicity it managed to achieve. This post is meant to give you a feel for what’s special about jj, and also describe a few patterns that have been working well for me, and which really are the reason I’m enjoying it.</p><p>Before we dive in, one last thing you should take note of, is that most people use jj with its Git backend. You can use jj with your existing Git repos and reap its benefits in a way that is completely transparent to others you’re collaborating with. Effectively, you can treat it like a Git frontend.</p><h2 id="undo">Undo</h2><p>Before I get to the meat, something that will surely be very useful for any of your experimentation with jj, and something I would’ve loved to have had in Git when I was learning it - you can undo any jj operation using <code>jj undo</code>, and view an operation log using <code>jj operation log</code>.</p><h2 id="changes">Changes</h2><p>Changes are the core primitive you’ll be working with in jj. In Git you had commits, in jj you have changes. A jj change is, however, <em>mutable</em>. A change can be modified. It’s ID, however, is immutable and randomly generated - it stays constant while you iterate on the change. A change refers to a <em>revision</em> (otherwise called a snapshot) which for our purposes is always a Git commit. As you keep working on and modifying a change, the commit SHA it refers to will change.</p><p>So to recap - immutable change IDs, mutable changes, mutable revision IDs (Git SHAs), immutable underlying revisions (snapshots - commits). Changes may eventually be marked as immutable - by default this happens (more or less) when they become part of the main branch or a Git tag.</p><p>While in Git you generally organize your commits in branches, and a commit that’s not part of a branch is scarily called a “detached HEAD”, in jj it’s completely normal to work on changes that are not on branches. <code>jj log</code> is the main command to view the history and tree of changes, and will default to showing you a very reasonable set of changes that should be relevant to you right now - that is (more or less) any local mutable changes, as well as some additional changes for context (like the tip of your main branch).</p><p>Changes in jj <em>can</em> be marked with bookmarks (what jj calls branches), but you’d generally do that only for the purpose of pushing to a remote Git server, like GitHub, not local organization.</p><p>Let’s see a sample of a <code>jj log</code> invocation:</p><pre><span></span><span>@</span>  <span></span><span>w</span><span>twtpovp</span><span> </span><span><a href="https://kubamartin.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="1c71795c77697e7d717d6e687572327f7371">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></span><span> </span><span>2025-01-29 23:46:57</span><span> </span><span>6</span><span>dae3649</span><span></span>

</pre><p>Quick tip: you can use <a href="https://github.com/theZiz/aha">aha</a> to convert colorized shell output to HTML.</p><p>The IDs on the left side are change IDs, while on the right size you have revisions (commit SHAs). Unique prefixes of those IDs are marked in color, and you can use those prefixes instead of the full form when referring to changes. A change can be reffered to in jj commands by its ID, the underlying commit SHA, or any bookmark referring to it.</p><p>There is one more, slightly crazy, thing about jj changes. Git has a special feature called the Git index to hold any as of yet uncommitted changes (where you <code>git add</code>, and then <code>git commit</code> them). In jj any files you modify are always in the scope of a change. Any modifications you make automatically become part of the current change, which is called the working copy. In the <code>jj log</code> output, this working copy is indicated by the <code>@</code> symbol. You create a new working change using <code>jj new</code> (by default as a child of the current change), and give it a description using <code>jj describe</code> (it starts out having an empty message). You can use <code>jj status</code> to get the metadata of the current change.</p><p>This much said, here’s a quick demo of changing a file as part of a new change.</p><p>Editing a file in a jj repo</p><p><code>jj</code> on its own is an alias for <code>jj log</code>.</p><div><p>Most jj commands default to operating on the current working change, but let you operate on an arbitrary change (or set of changes!) via the <code>--revision / -r</code> flag.</p></div><h3 id="pattern-git-stash">Pattern: git stash</h3><p>This whole thing about the working copy being a Change may sound weird, but it brings with it an important feature - you can operate on the working copy like on any other change. Personally, I’m a frequent user of <code>git stash</code>. When I’m working on something, I often want to pause for a moment and work on / try something else, only to later come back to what I was working on (while leaving that other experiment as yet another stash).</p><p>In jj, I can just <code>jj new @-</code>, which will start a new change from the parent of my current working copy - leaving my working copy as a normal change with all its file modifications “committed”, so I can later come back to it via <code>jj edit</code>.</p><div><p>The <code>-</code> after the <code>@</code> means "go one level up". It's basically "take the working copy change, and go to its parent". We'll come back to this briefly later, but suffice it to say that there's a whole sensible expression language here, and <code>@--</code> is similarly valid to refer to your grandparent change.</p></div><h2 id="editing-changes-in-weird-places">Editing Changes in Weird Places</h2><p>Another cool thing about changes is that you can freely edit any mutable change. <code>jj edit &lt;id&gt;</code> lets you “check out” and edit a given change. You can also squish a new change right after another (between it and its children). You can then keep modifying files in the context of that change, and any descendants will automatically be rebased on top of it (with their underlying commit SHAs likely changing, but change IDs staying the same). That sounds a bit scary if you’re used to Git (and dealing with conflicts in the middle of a rebase) but fear not, it’s actually pretty seamless, and we’ll come back to it later.</p><p>You can pass <code>-A</code> and <code>-B</code> to <code>jj new</code> to indicate that you want to squish a new change after, or before, another change.</p><p>With this, when I notice a mistake in a change 3 levels back, I can just <code>jj edit &lt;that-change-id&gt;</code> (with my working copy remaining there for me to come back to), make a fix, which will auto-rebase all following changes (including my original working change), and then <code>jj edit</code> to go back to my original working change.</p><p>Editing previous changes with automatic rebase</p><p>Occasionally you also need to rebase (move) a set of changes onto some change x, you can do that by using <code>jj rebase -s &lt;change-id-to-rebase&gt; -d &lt;destination-change&gt;</code>. The <code>-s</code> will bring all descendants along with the rebased change, and there are other variations of this command for different scenarios. E.g. <code>jj rebase -b &lt;branch&gt; -d &lt;destination-change&gt;</code> will rebase the entire given branch onto a change, and with no arguments it just defaults to <code>-b @</code>, so the current branch. In other words, to rebase the current branch onto main, it’s enough to run <code>jj rebase -d main</code>.</p><h3 id="pattern-squishing-a-fix-before-the-current-change">Pattern: Squishing a Fix Before the Current Change</h3><p>You noticed a mistake in your last change, don’t want to fix it as part of this one, and instead want to squish a fix right before it, but you have already done some “uncommitted” work? Just do <code>jj new -B @</code>. The <code>-B</code> means it’s squished before the current working change (referred to via <code>@</code>), and after the previous one (its parent). After you make the fix, you can go back to the original working change via <code>jj edit @+</code> (<code>+</code> is the opposite of <code>-</code>). You could also make the fix in the original working change and run <code>jj split --interactive</code> to use your favorite diff ui to select what to push down to a separate change placed right before the current one.</p><h2 id="bookmarks">Bookmarks</h2><p>In jj, instead of branches we have bookmarks. You create them using <code>jj bookmark create &lt;name&gt;</code> (abbreviated to <code>jj b c &lt;name&gt;</code>). You update a bookmark to point the current change using <code>jj bookmark set &lt;name&gt;</code>. You track remote bookmarks (which will create local corresponding bookmarks that update on <code>jj git fetch</code>) by doing <code>jj bookmark track &lt;name&gt;</code>.</p><p>When you add changes on top of a change that a bookmark is attached to, the bookmark won’t automatically move to your new change (like it would with a branch in Git), you have to <code>jj bookmark set</code> it manually. You can push bookmarks attached to the current change via <code>jj git push</code>. <code>jj git fetch</code> will fetch updates to bookmarks from your remote (so generally updates to branches).</p><h3 id="pattern-stacked-prs">Pattern: Stacked PRs</h3><p>A common use case with services like GitHub is to split up a big change into multiple PRs, let’s say Multipart 1, Multipart 2 and Multipart 3 (from branches multipart-1, multipart-2, and multipart-3 respectively). Each of them is based on the previous one, so you effectively have the following graph, with bookmark pointers on the way:</p><pre><span></span><span>@</span>  <span></span><span>vq</span><span>noywln</span><span> </span><span><a href="https://kubamartin.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="4a272f0a213f282b272b383e232464292527">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></span><span> </span><span>2025-01-30 18:57:23</span><span> </span><span>50</span><span>e48038</span><span></span>

In Git, once you add a commit to it (or modify an existing one), you would have to manually rebase all the other branches. Annoying!</p><p>How does jj help us here?

</pre><p>Then, whenever you want to move some modifications into one of the branches, you can use <code>jj squash --into &lt;target-change-id&gt; &lt;files&gt;</code> to move all modifications to a set of files down into one of the branches. There’s also <code>--interactive</code> where you can use a diff tool to choose modifications to squash into another change, and finally there’s a <a href="https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/cli-reference/#jj-absorb">newer <code>jj absorb</code> command</a> which can automate this process in certain scenarios.</p><p>Editing files in a merged dev-change and<br>selectively squashing the changes into branches</p><p>In conclusion, you can keep working in a local-only merge-change of your branches, and selectively push down any modifications to the relevant branch (This setup would’ve seemed pretty scary before jj, right? I hope it’s a bit less scary now.), and then push just those branches themselves to the remote.</p><h2 id="revset-expressions">Revset Expressions</h2><p>jj commands operate on revisions or sets of revisions (revsets). You can refer to those directly, or use a special expression language to describe them. You’ve seen me refer to a change previously via <code>@-</code>. That was a very simple expression that evaluated to the parent.</p><p>There is, however, much more. There are functions - like <code>parents(x)</code> to get the parents of a change - and operators - like <code>x+</code> to refer to the child of x, or <code>x::</code> for all descendants of x including x.</p><p><code>jj log</code> accepts a revset expression, so you can use it to experiment with them. The default revset it displays is also configurable. Overall, the expression language is powerful and consistent, with simple things being generally easy, and harder things being (presumably, I’ve honestly spent too little time with it) possible.</p><p>See <a href="https://v5.chriskrycho.com/essays/jj-init/#revisions-and-revsets">this article</a> for a much more extensive exploration of the jj expression language, and the <a href="https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/revsets/">jj docs</a> themselves.</p><h3 id="pattern-partial-stashes">Pattern: Partial Stashes</h3><p>Another kind of stash I occasionally like to do is partial, where I temporarily roll back changes to a set of files to verify the before-after (e.g. confirm that a passing test was failing before).</p><p>In jj the split command works well for this. Just <code>jj split --parallel modifiedFile.txt</code> will move the file into a parallel change. You can do whatever you want to do, and later run <code>jj squash --from parallel_change_id</code> to get the file modifications back into the current change.</p><p>Partial stash using <code>jj split --parallel</code></p><h2 id="setting-up-jj-with-an-existing-git-repo">Setting Up jj with an Existing Git Repo</h2><p>It’s trivial to start using jj with an existing git repo, though I’d advise cloning it fresh into a new directory.</p><p>In a directory where you already have a git repo, you can just run <code>jj git init --colocate</code>. Your <code>.git</code> directory will stay in place, and jj will keep it updated, so e.g. your editor won’t be confused what’s happening. It integrates fairly well, with e.g. the working change - even though it’s backed by a commit - being presented as the git index, so your editor can still show files “modified in this change”.</p><h2 id="should-you-switch">Should You Switch?</h2><p>The cost of switching is low, as it integrates seamlessly with your existing workflow. It frankly also takes a day tops to get used to, and there’s something to be said for using <em>nice</em> things. Sure, you can make excellent tea in any food-safe kettle, but if you have a nice tea kettle, you’ll enjoy it every time you make tea. I use my vcs quite a lot, so why not make that pleasant too?</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>I hope the above gave you an intuition for what Jujutsu, the VCS, is all about, and ideally even encouraged you to take a look at it.</p><p>If you’d like to do some more readings about jj, I’ve used the below articles and guides when learning it, and a lot of what I wrote above is inspired by parts of them.

                 <div><strong><span>CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA</span>&nbsp;</strong>Apple today introduced Apple Invites, a new app for iPhone that helps users create custom invitations to gather friends and family for any occasion. With Apple Invites, users can create and easily share invitations, RSVP, contribute to Shared Albums, and engage with Apple Music playlists. Starting today, users can download Apple Invites from the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/invites/id6472498645" target="_blank">App Store</a>, or access it on the web through <a href="https://www.icloud.com/invites/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-analytics-exit-link="">icloud.com/invites</a>. iCloud+ subscribers can create invitations, and anyone can RSVP, regardless of whether they have an Apple Account or Apple device.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>“With Apple Invites, an event comes to life from the moment the invitation is created, and users can share lasting memories even after they get together,” said Brent Chiu-Watson, Apple’s senior director of Worldwide Product Marketing for Apps and iCloud. “Apple Invites brings together capabilities our users already know and love across iPhone, iCloud, and Apple Music,&nbsp;making it easy to plan special events.”
</div>
                 
             
                 <h2><strong>Beautiful Invitations That Create and Capture Shared Moments</strong>
</h2>
                 
             
                 <div>To get started with Apple Invites, users can choose an image from their photo library or from the app’s gallery of backgrounds — a curated collection of images representing different occasions and event themes. Integrations with Maps and Weather give guests directions to the event and the forecast for that day.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>Additionally, participants can easily contribute photos and videos to a dedicated Shared Album within each invite to help preserve memories and relive the event. And collaborative playlists allow Apple Music subscribers to create a curated event soundtrack that guests can access right from Apple Invites.

<p>Code forces humans to be precise. That’s good—computers need precision. But it also forces humans to think like machines.</p>

<p>For decades we tried to fix this by making programming more human-friendly. Higher-level languages. Visual interfaces. Each step helped, but we were still translating human thoughts into computer instructions.</p>

<p>AI was supposed to change everything. Finally, plain English could be a programming language—one everyone already knows. No syntax. No rules. Just say what you want.</p>

<p>The first wave of AI coding tools squandered this opportunity. They make flashy demos but produce garbage software. People call them “great for prototyping,” which means “don’t use this for anything real.”</p>

<p>Many blame the AI models, saying we just need them to get smarter. This is wrong. Yes, better AI will make better guesses about what you mean. But when you’re building serious software, you don’t want guesses—even smart ones. You want to know exactly what you’re building.</p>

<p>Current AI tools pretend writing software is like having a conversation. It’s not. It’s like writing laws. You’re using English, but you’re defining terms, establishing rules, and managing complex interactions between everything you’ve said.</p>

<p>Try writing a tax code in chat messages. You can’t. Even simple tax codes are too complex to keep in your head. That’s why we use documents—they let us organize complexity, reference specific points, and track changes systematically. Chat reduces you to memory and hope.</p>

<p>This is the core problem. You can’t build real software without being precise about what you want. Every successful programming tool in history reflects this truth. AI briefly fooled us into thinking we could just chat our way to working software.</p>

<p>We can’t. You don’t program by chatting. You program by writing documents.</p>



<p>When your intent is in a document instead of scattered across a chat log, English becomes a real programming language:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You can see your whole system at once</li>
  <li>You can clarify and improve your intent</li>
  <li>You can track changes properly</li>
  <li>Teams can work on the system together</li>
  <li>Requirements become their own quality checks</li>
  <li>Changes start from clear specifications</li>
</ul>

<p>The first company to get this will own the next phase of AI development tools. They’ll build tools for real software instead of toys. They’ll make everything available today look like primitive experiments.</p>

            The US air traffic control system has been stretched nearly to its breaking point by a decades-long staffing shortage. It’s causing problems not just for the air traffic controllers that remain but the flying public at large.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm6pqzmu000023b6mmvykgpu8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            And it won’t get better any time soon.

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm6pqzmu000033b6mjagqpkwj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            The Federal Aviation Administration, which runs the air traffic system, stepped up the pace of hiring in 2024 under President Joe Biden. But even though 2,000 qualified applicants were hired last year, they might only just barely replace the 1,100 who left the job either through retirement or due to the heavy toll the stressful job takes on those who enter the field.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm6psqh7900013b6n9wf1r7ln@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            That’s because nearly half of those hired in any given year will wash out of the program before they get to actually control aircraft after about three years from their initial start date.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm6pqzmu000043b6mhloaivic@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            So even with an increase in the pace of hiring, it could take as much as 8 to 9 years to reach full staffing, according to Nick Daniels, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, the union representing 10,800 certified controllers across the nation. He said that 41% of the union’s members are working six days a week, 10 hours a day, just to provide a staffing level that still isn’t adequate. Those 10,800 controllers currently on the job are filling the 14,600 positions needed to meet the current demand.

            “We’ve been raising the alarm on this for years on end,” Daniels told CNN. “We need air traffic controllers. We need maximum hiring, so that these stresses and pressures can be taken off of us who are holding the system together today.”

            Anonymous reports to <a href="https://asrs.arc.nasa.gov/search/database.html" target="_blank">NASA’s Aviation Safety Reporting System</a> showed at least 10 submissions by controllers that included concerns about staffing, work schedules or fatigue in the last year alone.

            “We have been short staffed for too many years and it’s creating so many unsafe situations,” one controller in Southern California wrote last year, recounting how a small aircraft requesting assistance could not be helped due to workload issues. “The FAA has created an unsafe environment to work and for the flying public. The controllers’ mental health is deteriorating.”<strong> </strong>

            So, shortage is not only due to the rigorous standards that make it difficult and time consuming to fill the pipeline with new controllers, but the stresses, demands and hours controllers must work are leading to an attrition rate that makes it difficult for the new hires to make a dent in the shortage.

            The fatal crash at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport last week brought new attention to a decades-old problem. There are simply not enough air traffic controllers to keep aircraft a safe distance from one another.

            The cause of the crash between an American Airlines flight from Wichita, Kansas, on final approach for landing at the busy airport, and a US Army helicopter has yet to be determined. Crash investigators are not blaming the air traffic controller directing the traffic, who advised the helicopter to be aware of the regional jet’s position in the area ahead of the crash.

            But CNN has confirmed that one controller in the Reagan Washington National tower was staffing two different jobs, handling both local air traffic and helicopter traffic in the area. Daniels, the president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, the controllers’ union, is not allowed to comment on the causes of crash itself since the union is a party to the ongoing investigation.

            Despite the lack of information on the cause of the fatal mid-air collision, President Donald Trump blamed the FAA’s diversity, equity and inclusion policy, or DEI, for the crash, even though he provided no proof or evidence that the crash was caused by the controller or its hiring process.<strong> </strong>On his first day in office, he signed an executive order ending this DEI and other DEI programs throughout the federal government that were designed to broaden the applicant pool for hiring, wrongly claiming that the program lowered hiring standards for the job.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm6pqzmu0000b3b6mi954szok@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            “I put safety first. Obama, Biden and the Democrats put policy first,” he said. “We have to have our smartest people.”

            But despite Trump’s claims, the policies and standards for air traffic controllers had not gotten tougher under his administrations than under his two Democratic predecessors. Under both Trump’s first term and the Obama and Biden administrations, all controllers have had to pass some of the most rigorous processes for any government position. They have to go through aptitude testing, medical and psychological screening and security clearance, followed by training in an academy and then years of on-the-job training.
    </p>

            Daniels and others say that the FAA effort to broaden its pool of applicants through DEI in no way reduced the standards for those who got selected.

            “Whatever group we hire are going to have to through the same process, no matter what,” Daniels said. “No matter your race, no matter your gender. The more that apply that will be able to handle those rigorous standards, we want them to come and become an air traffic controller.”
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm6pqzmu0000f3b6muxvt2fq6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            The FAA did not respond to questions about its hiring process or the end of the DEI program that was announced by Trump administration officials.

            But experts in the field say even if it turns out that the shortage of air traffic controllers played no role in last week’s tragedy, everyone in the industry agrees that the shortage is affecting everyone in the flying public.

            “It is not sustainable,” said Michael McCormick, the head of the air traffic management program at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, which is helping to feed potential controllers into the system. “Everybody needs their downtime. Working 6 days a week continuously is fatiguing.”

            “Safety wise, it’s not an impact,” he said about the controller shortage. “But efficiency wise, it is.”

            Despite the shortage, air traffic controllers all got the offer that went to federal employees last week, to pay them through September <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/28/politics/federal-worker-buyouts-trump-administration/index.html">if they would resign</a> now, an effort by the Trump Administration in its early days to cut government spending. The letter threatened that there could not be “full assurance regarding the certainty” of their position if they declined the offer.

            Even if the controllers can’t leave with extra months of pay by giving notice, there is a serious attrition problem among air traffic controllers feeding the shortage.

            FAA rules require all controllers to retire when they turn 56. But Daniels said some controllers are leaving before that age limit. They’re eligible to retire after 25 years on the job, or after 20 years on the job if they are age 50 or above. The stress that goes with the staffing shortage and the six-day work weeks is making it difficult for some to stay as long as they might have with a fully staffed workforce.

            “The working conditions … have become consistently unsafe for those in the sky, as well as the physical and mental health of the controllers,” wrote a controller in NASA’s Aviation Safety Reporting System examined by CNN. “Overloaded sectors and sessions over 2, sometimes 3 hours have become common occurrences. We have recently had a heart attack, multiple panic attacks (including my own), people losing their medicals due to depression, and some that just outright quit the FAA because it has gotten so bad.”
    </p>

            But the way the FAA and the industry handles mental health issues may be exacerbating the shortage at best and masking far greater problems at worst.

            Reaching out for mental health assistance can lead to air traffic controllers losing their jobs. The current rules do not allow controllers to be on SSRI drugs such as Prozac, Lexapro or Zoloft, drugs to treat depression, anxiety and other mental health conditions, even if those conditions have nothing to do with their jobs.
    </p>

            “We are parents, we are American citizens that deal with the same stresses and pressures outside of work as everyone else does,” Daniels said. “And if you’re also at work six days a week, 60 hours inside that work week and then all of the stresses that come at work, all those factors combined can absolutely lead to an air traffic controller being distracted or not being in a place that they want to be.”
    </p>

            He said that if a controller’s doctor prescribes medication to deal with a depression from a death in the family or other non-work events, they can seek a waiver to be able to take that drug, but that process can take a year or more.
    </p>

            “(It’s a) very archaic method in the way that our health is looked at,” he said. “We are trying to work with the agency … to give controllers real time help so they can continue working and taking care of themselves simultaneously.”

            But President Trump attacked the idea that anyone dealing with mental health issues should be on the job as a controller at his press conference last week, saying that it amounted to an effort under Democratic administrations that sought to hire people with “severe intellectual and psychiatric disabilities” as controllers, which also is untrue.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong><a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/22/link-blog/">My approach to running a link blog</a> from <a href="https://simonwillison.net/">Simon Willison</a></strong></p><p>I decided to follow simon's approach to creating a link blog, where I can share interesting links I find on the internet along with my own comments and thoughts about them.</p><p>I have been following Simon for a long time because of the content he shares about AI. I often notice that he shares well-written blog posts with direct links to the original sources, along with his own thoughts on the topic, and sometimes even his own code snippets. I think this is an excellent way to share knowledge while also keeping a personal record. It’s much better than simply saving something to Readwise to read later and leaving a few highlights or dull comments like "interesting."</p><hr><p>From this article:</p><blockquote><p>The point of that article was to emphasize that blogging doesn’t have to be about unique insights. The value is in writing frequently and having something to show for it over time—worthwhile even if you don’t attract much of an audience (or any audience at all).</p></blockquote><p>I have to admit that this is often the biggest obstacle preventing me from writing new posts. Whenever I want to write about a topic, I usually find myself asking: Is it worth creating a new post? Is it unique enough? Is it valuable enough? Or is it just a waste of time for my readers?</p><p>Simon believes it's more valuable to "write frequently and have something to show for it over time—worthwhile." I will give this a try to see if it truly works for me.</p><blockquote><p>That’s the purpose of my link blog: it’s an ongoing log of things I’ve found—effectively a combination of public bookmarks and my own thoughts and commentary on why those things are interesting.</p></blockquote><p>Oh, I like this idea and that's why we are here.</p><blockquote><p>I try to add something extra. My goal with any link blog post is that if you read both my post and the source material you’ll have an enhanced experience over if you read just the source material itself.
...
I might tie it together to other similar concepts, including things I’ve written about in the past, for example linking Prompt caching with Claude to my coverage of Context caching for Google Gemini.</p></blockquote><p>That's really useful. In fact, it truly makes this blog more valuable. My current understanding is that I can add more background or another source to complement the original one. I will make an effort to do this in the future.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/modal-labs/doppel-bot">source code</a>)</em></p> <p>Internally at Modal, we spend a <em data-svelte-h="svelte-r6ouuz">lot</em> of time talking to each other on Slack.
Now, with the advent of open-source large language models, we had started to
wonder if all of this wasn’t a bit redundant. Could we have these language
models bike-shed on Slack for us, so we could spend our time on higher leverage
activities such as
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://twitter.com/modal_labs/status/1642262543757352960">paddleboarding in Tahiti</a>
instead?</p> <p>To test this, we fine-tuned
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-llama-3-1/">Llama 3.1</a> on
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://twitter.com/bernhardsson">Erik</a>’s Slack messages, and <code data-svelte-h="svelte-1g3u75n">@erik-bot</code> was

our metrics have been going up and to the right a little too much since we’ve
launched him…</p> <p>So, we are releasing the next best thing. <code data-svelte-h="svelte-166thr5">DoppelBot</code> is a Slack bot that you
can install in your own workspace, and fine-tune on your own Slack messages.
Follow the instructions <a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/modal-labs/doppel-bot#usage">here</a>
to replace your own CEO with an LLM today.</p> <p>All the components—scraping, fine-tuning, inference and slack event handlers run
on Modal, and the code itself is open-source and available
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/modal-labs/doppel-bot">here</a>. If you’re new to Modal, it’s
worth reiterating that <strong data-svelte-h="svelte-1ku0u9a">all of these components are also serverless and scale
to zero</strong>. This means that you can deploy and forget about them, because you’ll
only pay for compute when your app is used!</p> <h2 id="how-it-works" data-svelte-h="svelte-1a1youw">How it works</h2> <p>DoppelBot uses the Slack SDK to scrape messages from a Slack workspace, and
converts them into prompt/response pairs. It uses these to fine-tune a language
model using <a rel="nofollow" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685">Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)</a>, a
technique that produces a small adapter that can be merged with the base model
when needed, instead of modifying all the parameters in the base model. The
fine-tuned adapters for each user are stored in a Modal
<a href="https://modal.com/docs/guide/volumes">Volume</a>. When a user <code data-svelte-h="svelte-gbsc1q">@</code>s the bot,
Slack sends a webhook call to Modal, which loads the adapter for that user and
generates a response.</p> <p>We go into detail into each of these steps below, and provide commands for
running each of them individually. To follow along,
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/modal-labs/doppel-bot">clone the repo</a> and
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/modal-labs/doppel-bot#create-a-slack-app">set up a Slack token</a>
for yourself.</p> <h3 id="scraping-slack" data-svelte-h="svelte-7zwp6x">Scraping slack</h3>  <p>The scraper uses Modal’s <a href="https://modal.com/docs/guide/scale#scaling-out"><code data-svelte-h="svelte-15xk0yb">.map()</code></a> to fetch
messages from all public channels in parallel. Each thread is split into
contiguous messages from the target users and continguous messages from other
users. These will be fed into the model as prompts in the following format:</p>  <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1gft8ig">Initial versions of the model were prone to generating short responses
—&nbsp;unsurprising, because a majority of Slack communication is pretty terse.
Adding a minimum character length for the target user’s messages fixed this.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-u8ly6e">If you’re following along at home, you can run the scraper with the following
command:</p>  <p>Scraped results are stored in a Modal
<a href="https://modal.com/docs/guide/volumes">Volume</a>, so they can be used by the next step.</p> <h3 id="fine-tuning" data-svelte-h="svelte-1mpeoh0">Fine-tuning</h3>  <p>Next, we use the prompts to fine-tune a language model. We chose
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-llama-3-1/">Llama 3.1</a> because of its permissive license and high quality relative to its small size. Fine-tuning is
done using <a rel="nofollow" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685">Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)</a>, a
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://huggingface.co/blog/peft">parameter-efficient fine-tuning</a> technique
that produces a small adapter that can be merged with the base model when needed
(~60MB for the rank we’re using).</p> <p>Our fine-tuning implementation uses <a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/pytorch/torchtune">torchtune</a>, a new PyTorch library for easily configuring fine-tuning runs.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1pw8e1">Because of the typically small sample sizes we’re working with, training for
longer than a couple hundred steps (with our batch size of 128) quickly led to
overfitting. Admittedly, we haven’t thoroughly evaluated the hyperparameter
space yet — do reach out to us if you’re interested in collaborating on this!</p> <p> <img src="https://modal.com/_app/immutable/assets/train-loss.DFD7oOI8.png" alt="train-loss"> </p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1p21b9i">To try this step yourself, run:</p>  <h3 id="inference" data-svelte-h="svelte-m1ii7y">Inference</h3>  <p>We use <a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm">vLLM</a> as our inference engine, which now comes with support for dynamically swapping LoRA adapters <a rel="nofollow" href="https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/features/lora.html">out of the box</a>.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1x43796">With parametrized functions, every user model gets its own pool of containers
that scales up when there are incoming requests, and scales to 0 when there’s
none. Here’s what that looks like stripped down to the essentials:</p>  <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1tzj64k">If you’ve fine-tuned a model already in the previous step, you can run inference
using it now:</p>  <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1ejsiyh">(We have a list of sample inputs in the file, but you can also try it out with
your own messages!)</p> <h3 id="slack-bot" data-svelte-h="svelte-va6bst">Slack Bot</h3>  <p>Finally, it all comes together in
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/modal-labs/doppel-bot/blob/main/src/bot.py"><code data-svelte-h="svelte-195divq">bot.py</code></a>. As
you might have guessed, all events from Slack are handled by serverless Modal
functions. We handle 3 types of events:</p> <ul><li><a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/modal-labs/doppel-bot/blob/24609583c43c0e722f56f85a1c00bb55b46c7754/src/bot.py#L112"><code data-svelte-h="svelte-hfc5fx">url_verification</code></a>:

string.</li> <li><a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/modal-labs/doppel-bot/blob/main/src/bot.py#L118"><code data-svelte-h="svelte-14xb794">app_mention</code></a>:

make it work with multiple workspaces, we’ll need to handle
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://api.slack.com/authentication/oauth-v2">workspace installation and authentication with OAuth</a>,
and also store some state for each workspace.</p> <p>Luckily, Slack’s <a rel="nofollow" href="https://slack.dev/bolt-python/concepts">Bolt</a> framework
provides a complete (but frugally documented) OAuth implemention. A neat feature
is that the OAuth state can be backed by a file system, so all we need to do is
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/modal-labs/doppel-bot/blob/24609583c43c0e722f56f85a1c00bb55b46c7754/src/bot.py#L78">point Bolt</a>
at a Modal <a href="https://modal.com/docs/guide/volumes">Volume</a>, and then we don’t need to worry about
managing this state ourselves.</p> <p>To store state for each workspace, we’re using <a rel="nofollow" href="https://neon.tech/">Neon</a>, a

    </p><div data-headline="The Lost Story of Alan Turing’s Secret “Delilah” Project"><p><strong>It was 8 May 1945,</strong> Victory in Europe Day. With the German military’s unconditional surrender, the European part of World War II came to an end. <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/alan-turing">Alan Turing</a> and his assistant Donald Bayley celebrated victory in their quiet English way, by taking a long walk together. They had been working side by side for more than a year in a secret electronics laboratory, deep in the English countryside. Bayley, a young electrical engineer, knew little about his boss’s other life as a code breaker, only that Turing would set off on his bicycle every now and then to another secret establishment about 10 miles away along rural lanes, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/bletchley-park">Bletchley Park</a>. As Bayley and the rest of the world would later learn, Bletchley Park was the headquarters of a vast, unprecedented code-breaking operation.
</p><p>
	When they sat down for a rest in a clearing in the woods, Bayley said, “Well, the war’s over now—it’s peacetime, so you can tell us all.”

There, he was selected to work with Alan Turing on the Delilah project. In later life he designed the teletypewriter-based “Piccolo” systemfor secret diplomatic radio communications, adopted by the British Foreign  and Commonwealth Office and used worldwide for decades.</small><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Bonhams</small></p><p>
	“Don’t be so bloody silly,” Turing replied.
</p><p>
	“That was the end of that conversation,” Bayley recalled 67 years later.

He is not so well-known, however, for his work in electrical engineering. This may be about to change.</span></p><p><span></span><span>In November 2023, a large cache of his wartime papers—nicknamed the “Bayley papers”—was

The previously unknown cache contains many sheets in Turing’s own handwriting, telling of his top-secret “Delilah” engineering project from 1943 to 1945. Delilah was Turing’s portable voice-encryption system, named after the biblical deceiver of men. There is also material written by Bayley, often in the form of notes he took while Turing was speaking. It is thanks to Bayley that the papers survived: He kept them until he died in 2020, 66 years after Turing passed away.</span></p><p>
	When the British Government learned about the sale of these papers at auction, it acted swiftly to put a ban on their export, declaring them to be “an important part of our national story,” and saying “It is right that a UK buyer has the opportunity to purchase these papers.” I was lucky enough to get access to the collection prior to the November sale, when the auction house asked for my assistance in identifying some of the technical material. The Bayley papers shine new light on Turing the engineer.
</p><p>
	At the time, Turing was traveling from the abstract to the concrete. The papers offer intriguing snapshots of his journey from his prewar focus on mathematical logic and number theory, into a new world of circuits, electronics, and engineering math.
</p><h2>Alan Turing’s Delilah Project</h2><p>
	During the war, Turing realized that cryptology’s new frontier was going to be the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/encryption">encryption</a> of speech. The existing wartime cipher machines—such as the Japanese “
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_B_Cipher_Machine" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Purple” machine</a>, the British<a href="https://typex.virtualcolossus.co.uk/typex.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> Typex</a>, and the Germans’ famous<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> Enigma</a> and teletypewriter-based<a href="https://www.colossus-computer.com/colossus1.html#section02" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> SZ42</a>—were all for encrypting typewritten text. Text, though, is scarcely the most convenient way for commanders to communicate, and secure voice communication was on the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/military">military</a> wish list.
</p><p>
	Bell Labs’ pioneering
	<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/rebuilding-a-piece-of-the-first-digital-voice-scrambler" target="_self"> SIGSALY</a> speech-encryption system was <a href="https://www.cryptomuseum.com/crypto/usa/sigsaly/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">constructed</a> in <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/new-york-city">New York City</a>, under a U.S. Army contract, during 1942 and 1943. It was gigantic, weighing over 50 thousand kilograms and filling a room. Turing was familiar with <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/sigsaly">SIGSALY</a> and wanted to miniaturize speech encryption. The result, Delilah, consisted of three small units, each roughly the size of a shoebox. Weighing just 39 kg, including its power pack, Delilah would be at home in a truck, a trench, or a large backpack.

Today, Hanslope Park is still an ultrasecret intelligence site known as<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HM_Government_Communications_Centre" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> His Majesty’s Government Communications Centre</a>. In the Turing tradition, HMGCC engineers supply today’s British intelligence agents with specialized hardware and software.</p><p>Turing seems to have enjoyed the two years he spent at Hanslope Park working on Delilah. He made an old cottage his home and took meals in the Army mess. The commanding officer recalled that he “soon settled down and became one of us.” In 1944, Turing acquired his young assistant, Bayley, who had recently graduated from the University of Birmingham with a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering. The two became good friends, working together on Delilah until the autumn of 1945. Bayley called Turing simply “Prof,” as everyone did in the Bletchley-Hanslope orbit.</p><p>“I admired the originality of his mind,” Bayley told me when I interviewed him in the 1990s. “He taught me a great deal, for which I have always been grateful.”</p><p>In return, Bayley taught Turing bench skills.

This “did all that could be expected of it,” Bayley said. He described the Delilah system as “one of the first to be based on rigorous cryptographic principles.”</span></p><h2>How Turing’s Voice-Encryption System Worked</h2><p>
	Turing drew inspiration for the voice-encryption system from existing cipher machines for text. Teletypewriter-based cipher machines such as the Germans’ sophisticated SZ42—broken by Turing and his colleagues at Bletchley Park—worked differently from the better known <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/enigma">Enigma</a> machine. Enigma was usually used for messages transmitted over radio in <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/morse-code">Morse code</a>. It encrypted the letters 
	<em><em>A</em></em> through <em><em>Z</em></em> by lighting up corresponding letters on a panel, called the lampboard, whose electrical connections with the keyboard were continually changing. The SZ42, by contrast, was attached to a regular teletypewriter that used a 5-bit <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/telegraph">telegraph</a> code and could handle not just letters, but also numbers and a range of punctuation. Morse code was not involved. (This 5-bit telegraph code was a forerunner of ASCII and <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/unicode">Unicode</a> and is still used by some <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/ham-radio">ham radio</a> operators.)
</p><p>
	The SZ42 encrypted the teletypewriter’s output by adding a sequence of obscuring telegraph characters, called key (the singular form “key” was used by the codebreakers and codemakers as a mass noun, like “footwear” or “output”), to the plain message. For example, if the German plaintext was ANGREIFEN UM NUL NUL UHR (Attack at zero hundred hours), and the obscuring characters that were being used to encrypt these three words (and also the space between them) were Y/RABV8WOUJL/H9VF3JX/D5Z, then the cipher machine would first add “Y” to “A”—that is to say, add the 5-bit code of the first letter of the key to the 5-bit code of the first letter of the plaintext—and then added “/” to “N”, then “R” to “G”, and so on. Under the SZ42’s rules for character addition (which were hardwired into the machine), these 24 additions would produce PNTDOOLLHANC9OAND9NK9CK5, which was the encrypted message. This principle of generating the obscuring key and then adding it to the plain message was the concept that Turing extended to the new territory of speech encryption.

	 Inside the SZ42, the key was produced by a key generator, consisting of a system of 12 wheels. As the wheels turned, they churned out a continual stream of seemingly random characters. The wheels in the receiver’s machine were synchronized with the sender’s, and so produced the same characters—Y/RABV8WOUJL/H9VF3JX/D5Z in our example. The receiving machine subtracted the key from the incoming ciphertext PNTDOOLLHANC9OAND9NK9CK5, revealing the plaintext ANGREIFEN9UM9NUL9NUL9UHR (a space was always typed as “9”).
</p><p>
	 Applying a similar principle, Delilah added the obscuring key to spoken words. In Delilah’s case, the key was a stream of pseudorandom numbers—that is, random-seeming numbers that were not truly random. Delilah’s key generator contained five rotating wheels and some fancy electronics concocted by Turing. As with the SZ42, the receiver’s key generator had to be synchronized with the sender’s, so that both machines produced identical key. In their once highly secret but

Multivibrators were an essential component of Delilah’s key-generation module. </small><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Bonhams</small></p><p>
	 The encryption-decryption process began with discretizing the audio signal, which today we’d call analog-to-digital conversion. This produced a sequence of individual numbers, each corresponding to the signal’s voltage at a particular point in time. Then numbers from Delilah’s key were added to these numbers. During the addition, any digits that needed to be carried over to the next column were left out of the calculation—called “noncarrying” addition, this helped scramble the message. The resulting sequence of numbers was the encrypted form of the speech signal. This was transmitted automatically to a second Delilah at the receiving end. The receiving Delilah subtracted the key from the incoming transmission, and then converted the resulting numbers to voltages to reproduce the original speech.
</p><p>
	The result was “whistly” and full of background noise, but usually intelligible—although if things went wrong, there could be “a sudden crack like a rifle shot,” Turing and Bayley reported cheerfully.
</p><p>
	 But the war was winding down, and the military was not attracted to the system. Work on the Delilah project stopped not long after the war ended, when Turing was hired by the British National Physical Laboratory to design and develop an electronic computer. Delilah “had little potential for further development,” Bayley said and “was soon forgotten.” Yet it offered a very high level of <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/security">security</a>, and was the first successful demonstration of a compact portable device for voice encryption.
</p><p>
	What’s more, Turing’s two years of immersion in electrical engineering stood him in good stead, as he moved on to designing electronic computers.
</p><h2>Turing’s Lab Notebook</h2><p>
	The two years Turing spent on Delilah produced the Bayley papers. The papers comprise a laboratory notebook, a considerable quantity of loose sheets (some organized into bundles), and—the jewel of the collection—a looseleaf ring binder bulging with pages.
</p><p>
	The greenish-gray quarto-size lab notebook, much of it in Turing’s handwriting, details months of work. The first experiment Turing recorded involved measuring a pulse emitted by a 
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivibrator#:~:text=A%20multivibrator%20is%20an%20electronic,Bloch%20during%20World%20War%20I.'" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">multivibrator</a>, which is a circuit that can be triggered to produce a single voltage pulse or a chain of pulses. In the experiment, the pulse was fed into an <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/oscilloscope">oscilloscope</a> and its shape examined. Multivibrators were crucial components of Turing’s all-important key generator, and the next page of the notebook, labeled “Measurement of ‘Heaviside function,’ ” shows the voltages measured in part of the same multivibrator circuit.
</p><p><img alt="An old notebook with graph paper on the left and a table on the right " data-rm-shortcode-id="1db224d97eede4191acec2081c8d95c7" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/an-old-notebook-with-graph-paper-on-the-left-and-a-table-on-the-right.jpg?id=56152432&amp;width=980" height="2832" id="ce2ba" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/an-old-notebook-with-graph-paper-on-the-left-and-a-table-on-the-right.jpg?id=56152432&amp;width=980" width="4291"><small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">A key item in the Bayley papers is this lab notebook, whose first 24 pages are in Turing’s handwriting. These detail Turing’s work on the Delilah project prior to Bayley’s arrival in March 1944.</small><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Bonhams</small></p><p>
	 Today, there is intense interest in the use of multivibrators in <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/cryptography">cryptography</a>. Turing’s key generator, the most original part of Delilah, contained eight multivibrator circuits, along with the five-wheel assembly mentioned previously. In effect the multivibrators were eight more very complicated “wheels,” and there was additional circuitry for enhancing the random appearance of the numbers the multivibrators produced.
</p><p>
	Subsequent experiments recorded in the lab book tested the performance of all the main parts of Delilah—the pulse <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/modulator">modulator</a>, the harmonic analyzer, the key generator, the signal and oscillator circuits, and the radio frequency and aerial circuits. Turing worked alone for approximately the first six months of the project, before Bayley’s arrival in March 1944, and the notebook is in Turing’s handwriting up to and including the testing of the key generator. After this, the job of recording experiments passed to Bayley.
</p><h2>The Bandwidth Theorem</h2><p data-rm-resized-container="25%"><img alt="A page with math scribbled all over it." data-rm-shortcode-id="a8f1ff3b0c9a75a1d67189e466a46152" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-page-with-math-scribbled-all-over-it.png?id=56146136&amp;width=980" height="3838" id="b7377" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-page-with-math-scribbled-all-over-it.png?id=56146136&amp;width=980" width="3000"><small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">Two loose pages, in Turing’s handwriting, explain the so-called bandwidth theorem, now known as the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem. This was likely written out for Bayley’s benefit. </small><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Bonhams</small></p><p>
	Among the piles of loose sheets covered with Turing’s riotously untidy handwriting, one page is headed “Bandwidth Theorem.” Delilah was in effect an application of a bandwidth theorem that today is known as the Nyquist-Shannon 
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist%E2%80%93Shannon_sampling_theorem" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sampling theorem</a>. Turing’s proof of the theorem is scrawled over two sheets. Most probably he wrote the proof out for Bayley’s benefit. The theorem—which expresses what the sampling rate needs to be if sound waves are to be reproduced accurately—governed Delilah’s conversion of sound waves into numbers, done by sampling vocal frequencies several thousand times a second.
</p><p>
	At <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Labs" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bell Labs</a>,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Shannon" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> Claude Shannon had</a> written a paper sketching previous work on the theorem and then proving his own formulation of it. Shannon wrote the paper in 1940, although it was not published until 1949. <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/a-man-in-a-hurry-claude-shannons-new-york-years" target="_self">Turing worked at Bell Labs</a> for a time in 1943, in connection with SIGSALY, before returning to England and embarking on Delilah. It seems likely that he and Shannon would have discussed sampling rates.
</p><h2>Turing’s “Red Form” Notes</h2><p>
	During the war, Hanslope Park housed a large radio-monitoring section. Shifts of operators continuously searched the airwaves for enemy messages. Enigma transmissions, in Morse code, were identified by their stereotypical military format, while the distinctive warble of the SZ42’s radioteletype signals was instantly recognizable. After latching onto a transmission, an operator filled out an Army-issue form (preprinted in bright red ink). The frequency, the time of interception, and the letters of ciphertext were noted down. This “red form” was then rushed to the code breakers at Bletchley Park.
</p><p><img alt="Old yellow paper with red marking. " data-rm-shortcode-id="bb5fc9ca4f7e3888204694dee9aabaa8" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/old-yellow-paper-with-red-marking.jpg?id=56152435&amp;width=980" height="2339" id="abff7" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/old-yellow-paper-with-red-marking.jpg?id=56152435&amp;width=980" width="3119"><small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">Writing paper was in short supply in wartime Britain, and Turing used the blank reverse sides of these “red form” sheets, designed for radio operators to note down information about intercepted signals.</small><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Bonhams</small></p><p>
	Writing paper was in short supply in wartime Britain. Turing evidently helped himself to large handfuls of red forms, scrawling out screeds of notes about Delilah on the blank reverse sides. In one bundle of red forms, numbered by Turing at the corners, he considered a resistance-capacitance network into which a “pulse of area A at time 0” is input. He calculated the charge as the pulse passes through the network, and then calculated the “output volts with pulse of that area.” The following sheets are covered with integral equations involving time, resistance, and charge. Then a scribbled diagram appears, in which a wavelike pulse is analyzed into discrete “steps”—a prelude to several pages of
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_analysis" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> Fourier</a>-type analysis. Turing appended a proof of what he termed the “Fourier theorem,” evidence that these pages may have been a tutorial for Bayley.
</p><p>
	 The very appearance of these papers speaks to the character and challenging nature of the Delilah project. The normally top-secret Army red forms, the evidence of wartime shortages, the scribbled formulas, the complexity of the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/mathematics">mathematics</a>, the tutorials for Bayley—all contribute to the picture of the Prof and his young assistant working closely together at a secret military establishment on a device that pushed the engineering envelope.
</p><h2>Turing’s Lectures for <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/electrical-engineers">Electrical Engineers</a></h2><p>
	The cover of the looseleaf ring binder is embossed in gilt letters “Queen Mary’s School, Walsall,” where Bayley had once been a pupil. It is crammed with handwritten notes taken by Bayley during a series of evening lectures that Turing gave at Hanslope Park. The size of Turing’s audience is unknown, but there were numerous young engineers like Bayley at Hanslope.
</p><p>
	These notes can reasonably be given the title 
	<em><em>Turing’s Lectures on Advanced Mathematics for Electrical Engineers</em></em>. Running to 180 pages, they are the most extensive noncryptographic work by Turing currently known, vying in length with his 1940 write-up about Enigma and the Bombe, affectionately known at Bletchley Park as “Prof’s Book.”
</p><p>
	 Stepping back a little helps to put this important discovery into context. The traditional picture of Turing held him to be a mathematician’s mathematician, dwelling in a realm far removed from practical engineering. In 1966, for instance, 
	<em><em>Scientific American</em></em> ran an article by the legendary computer scientist and AI pioneer John McCarthy, in which he stated that Turing’s work did not play “any direct role in the labors of the men who made the computer a reality.” It was a common view at the time.
</p><p><img alt="Old two-ring binder opened to a page of math. " data-rm-shortcode-id="dfc9f40ea8789a8b9c44c99bbb3bcee5" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/old-two-ring-binder-opened-to-a-page-of-math.jpg?id=56152445&amp;width=980" height="2887" id="efe7c" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/old-two-ring-binder-opened-to-a-page-of-math.jpg?id=56152445&amp;width=980" width="4768"><small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">A binder filled with Bayley’s notes of Turing’s lectures is the jewel of the recently sold document collection.</small><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Bonhams</small></p><p>
	As we now know, though, after the war Turing himself designed an electronic computer, called the Automatic <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/computing">Computing</a> Engine, or ACE. What’s more, he designed the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/programming">programming</a> system for the Manchester University “Baby” computer, as well as the hardware for its punched-tape input/output. Baby came to life in mid-1948. Although small, it was the first truly stored-program electronic computer. Two years later, the prototype of Turing’s ACE ran its first program. The prototype was later commercialized as the English Electric DEUCE (Digital Electronic Universal Computing Engine). Dozens of DEUCEs were purchased—big sales in those days—and so Turing’s computer became a major workhorse during the first decades of the Digital Age.
</p><p>
	Yet the image has persisted of Turing as someone who made fundamental yet abstract contributions, rather than as someone whose endeavors sometimes fit onto the spectrum from bench electronics through to engineering theory. The Bayley papers bring a different Turing into focus: Turing the creative electrical engineer, with blobs of solder all over his shoes—even if his soldered joints did have a tendency to come apart, as Bayley loved to relate.
</p><p>
	Turing’s lecture notes are in effect a textbook, terse and selective, on advanced math for circuit engineers, although now very out-of-date, of course.
</p><p>
	There is little specifically about electronics in the lectures, aside from passing mentions, such as a reference to cathode followers. When talking about the Delilah project, Bayley liked to say that Turing had only recently taught himself elementary electronics, by studying an <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/rca">RCA</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/vacuum-tube">vacuum tube</a> manual while he crossed the Atlantic from New York to Liverpool in March 1943. This cannot be entirely accurate, however, because in 1940 Turing’s “Prof’s Book” described the use of some electronics. He detailed an arrangement of 26 thyratron tubes powered by a 26-phase supply, with each tube controlling a double-coil relay “which only trips if the thyratron fails to fire.”
</p><p>
	Turing’s knowledge of practical electronics was probably inferior to his assistant’s, initially anyway, since Bayley had studied the subject at university and then was involved with <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/radar">radar</a> before his transfer to Hanslope Park. When it came to the mathematical side of things, however, the situation was very different. The Bayley papers demonstrate the maturity of Turing’s knowledge of the mathematics of electrical circuit design—knowledge that was essential to the success of the Delilah project.
</p><p>
	The unusual breadth of Turing’s intellectual talents—mathematician, logician, code breaker, philosopher, computer theoretician, AI pioneer, and computational biologist—is already part and parcel of his public persona. To these must now also be added an appreciation of his idiosyncratic prowess in electrical engineering.

            <span>Abstract:</span>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable potential in reasoning while they still suffer from severe factual hallucinations due to timeliness, accuracy, and coverage of parametric knowledge. Meanwhile, integrating reasoning with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) remains challenging due to ineffective task decomposition and redundant retrieval, which can introduce noise and degrade response quality. In this paper, we propose DeepRAG, a framework that models retrieval-augmented reasoning as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), enabling strategic and adaptive retrieval. By iteratively decomposing queries, DeepRAG dynamically determines whether to retrieve external knowledge or rely on parametric reasoning at each step. Experiments show that DeepRAG improves retrieval efficiency while improving answer accuracy by 21.99%, demonstrating its effectiveness in optimizing retrieval-augmented reasoning.

<p>Having worked "around the clock" to move from Google Cloud Platform after its open source credits there ran out, and now rushing to move off Equinix, Tissoires suggests a new plan: "[H]ave [freedesktop.org] pay for its own servers, and then have sponsors chip in."</p>
<h2>“Popular without most users knowing it”</h2>
<p>Alpine Linux, a small, security-minded distribution used in many containers and embedded devices, also needs a new home quickly. As <a href="https://alpinelinux.org/posts/Seeking-Support-After-Equinix-Metal-Sunsets.html">detailed in its blog</a>, Alpine Linux uses about 800TB of bandwidth each month and also needs continuous integration runners (or separate job agents), as well as a development box. Alpine states it is seeking co-location space and bare-metal servers near the Netherlands, though it will consider virtual machines if bare metal is not feasible.</p>
<p>Like X.org/Freedesktop, Alpine is using this moment as a wake-up call. Responding to Ars, Carlo Landmeter, who serves on Alpine's council, noted that Alpine Linux is a kind of open source project "that became popular without most users knowing it." Users are starting to donate, and companies are reaching out to help, but it's still "early days," Landmeter wrote.</p>
<p>Every so often, those working at the foundations of open source software experience something that highlights <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/04/tech-giants-chastened-by-heartbleed-finally-agree-to-fund-openssl/">the mismatch between a project's importance and its support and funding</a>. Perhaps some people or some organizations will do the harder work of finding a sustaining future for these projects.</p>
<p>Ars has reached out to Equinix and X/Freedesktop and will update this post with responses.</p>

<p dir="auto"><strong>nv_cluster_lod_builder</strong> is a <em>continuous</em> level of detail (LOD) mesh library.
Continuous LOD allows for fine-grained control over geometric detail within a
mesh, compared to traditional discrete LOD. Clusters of triangles are carefully
precomputed by decimating the original mesh in a way that they can be seamlessly
combined across different LOD levels. At rendering time, a subset of these
clusters is selected to adaptively provide the required amount of detail as the
camera navigates the scene.</p>
<p dir="auto">Key features of continuous LOD systems include:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Fast rendering with more detail:</strong> Triangles are allocated where they are
most needed.</li>
<li><strong>Reduced memory usage with geometry streaming:</strong> Particularly beneficial for
ray tracing applications.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">This library serves as a quick placeholder or learning tool, demonstrating the
basics of creating continuous LOD data. For a reference implementation of the
rendering system, see
<a href="https://github.com/nvpro-samples/vk_lod_clusters">https://github.com/nvpro-samples/vk_lod_clusters</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Input:</strong> a triangle mesh with millions of triangles</p>

<li>Detail or decimation error of the group's decimated geometry is not small enough</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">This is the gist, but the library also does some massaging of the values that
feed into these checks to make sure multiple LODs do not render over the top of
each other. See below.</p>

<p dir="auto">The key to continuous LOD is a decimation strategy that allows regular
watertight LOD transitions across a mesh. Such transitions require borders that
match on both sides, and are obtained by keeping the border of the triangle
edges fixed during decimation. Since these edges do not change, successive
iterations of decimation must choose different borders and fix new edges to let
the old ones decimate.</p>
<p dir="auto">To explain why, consider forming groups of triangles and decimating triangles
within. Then grouping the decimated groups and decimating again <em>recursively</em>
until there is just one root group. In this case, some of the vertices would
remain fixed across the entire hierarchy, and would be decimated only when the
last two groups are grouped and decimated to form the coarsest LOD. To avoid
this, new groups must instead be allowed to cross any border, and in fact
encouraged to.</p>
<p dir="auto">This library makes groups of geometry and decimates within <em>groups</em>. Decimated
geometry is then re-grouped, encouraging crossing the old group's borders when
forming new groups. Groups are made from clusters of triangle rather than just
triangles for performance reasons. A group is a cluster of clusters of
triangles. Whole triangle clusters are swapped in and out at runtime for detail
transitions.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Building LODs</h3><a id="user-content-building-lods" aria-label="Permalink: Building LODs" href="#building-lods"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/nvpro-samples/nv_cluster_lod_builder/blob/main/doc/lod_generate.jpg"><img src="https://github.com/nvpro-samples/nv_cluster_lod_builder/raw/main/doc/lod_generate.jpg" width="600"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The image above shows the process that is repeated to create LODs until there is
just a single cluster representing the whole mesh:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">Make clusters [, within old borders]</p>
<p dir="auto">This library uses
<a href="https://github.com/nvpro-samples/nv_cluster_builder">nv_cluster_builder</a>'
segmented API to make clusters of a fixed size from triangles within groups
of the previous iteration, or globally for the first iteration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Group clusters [, crossing old borders]</p>
<p dir="auto">This is just making clusters of clusters, but with a catch. Border edges
cannot decimate so it is important to encourage grouping clusters in a way to
keep old borders internal to the group. Then the previously locked edges are
free to decimate. This is done by adding a connection and weight between
clusters sharing many vertices (locked in particular) and optimizing for a
<em>minimum cut</em> when making cluster groups with
<a href="https://github.com/nvpro-samples/nv_cluster_builder">nv_cluster_builder</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">If there is only one cluster in one group, the operation is complete.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Decimate within groups, keep border</p>
<p dir="auto">Vertices shared between groups are computed and locked before using
<a href="https://github.com/zeux/meshoptimizer">meshoptimizer</a>'s <code>simplify</code> to
decimate each cluster group. The aim is to halve the number of triangles.
These become the input to the next iteration.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">The code is documented and intended to be read too. These steps can be found in
<code>nvclusterlodMeshCreate()</code> at the bottom of
<a href="https://github.com/nvpro-samples/nv_cluster_lod_builder/blob/main/src/nvclusterlod_mesh.cpp"><code>nvclusterlod_mesh.cpp</code></a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">When decimating, the generating group is tracked. This is the geometry each
cluster was decimated from. A cluster's group is one of many groups generated by
decimating its generating group. Similarly a group has many generating groups.
Clusters will be selected in intersections of groups and generating groups -
perhaps something to optimize the decision making with. The term <em>parent</em> is
avoided due to possible confusion between the originating geometry and the
direction to the root node.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/nvpro-samples/nv_cluster_lod_builder/blob/main/doc/lod_dag.svg"><img src="https://github.com/nvpro-samples/nv_cluster_lod_builder/raw/main/doc/lod_dag.svg" alt=""></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The image above shows an example 2D illustration with colored groups, their
clusterings and relationships. Notably, two groups of clusters may produce
decimated clusters that are both part of a new group. This allows group borders
to be decimated after each iteration. The relationships form a directed acyclic
graph (DAG), i.e. not a tree, with the constraint that relationships don't skip
levels - but maybe that could help with uneven detail? LOD transitions may only
happen across group borders, which places a limit on the rate of LOD change.</p>
<p dir="auto">The output data are:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Clusters of triangles, referencing vertices in the original mesh</li>
<li>Groupings of clusters and their relationships:
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Generating geometry, input to decimation</li>
<li>Generated geometry, decimation output</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Group bounding spheres</li>
<li>Group decimation quadric error</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Selecting Clusters</h3><a id="user-content-selecting-clusters" aria-label="Permalink: Selecting Clusters" href="#selecting-clusters"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The first step is to pick the goal. A couple of examples are:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Pixel-sized triangles?</li>
<li>Sub-pixel-sized geometric error?</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">The latter may be more efficient if for example large triangles give the same
visual result. This may be more challenging to quantify particularly if
decimation introduces error not captured by the metric. For the moment this
library uses <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./garland/Papers/quadrics.pdf" rel="nofollow"><em>quadric
error</em></a>, an approximate
measure of the object-space distance between the decimated mesh and the original
high-resolution mesh. Inaccuracies from decimating vertex attributes such as
normals and UVs are currently ignored.</p>
<p dir="auto">A conservative maximum vertex position error is maintained for all cluster
groups. This is the farthest any vertex may be from representing the original
surface. When rendering we ask, "what is the largest possible angular error from
the camera?" for a particular group. We then want to render geometry when its
error is just less than a threshold, but not any overlapping geometry.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/nvpro-samples/nv_cluster_lod_builder/blob/main/doc/arcsin_angular_error.svg"><img src="https://github.com/nvpro-samples/nv_cluster_lod_builder/raw/main/doc/arcsin_angular_error.svg" alt=""></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The farthest a decimated vertex may be incorrectly representing geometry is the
quadric error. This will be bigger in screen space nearer the camera so the
nearest point on the group's bounding sphere is chosen. The largest possible
angular error from the camera is then the angular size of a sphere with quadric
error radius at that point. Convenient and simple: the arcsine of the error
divided by the distance to the closest point on the bounding sphere. A target
threshold can be chosen based on a single pixel's FOV at the center of the
projection - to keep any geometric error less than the size of a pixel. This
avoids varying the threshold across the image, which would further complicate a
problem yet to solve.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/nvpro-samples/nv_cluster_lod_builder/blob/main/doc/graph_cut.svg"><img src="https://github.com/nvpro-samples/nv_cluster_lod_builder/raw/main/doc/graph_cut.svg" alt=""></a></p>
<p dir="auto">We have a target goal and a way to compute it, but how can we guarantee a single
unique continuous surface? I.e. no holes and no overlaps. An ideal solution
would be to pick clusters that satisfy the angular error threshold but constrain
the rest to only making a single LOD transition per group. That would require
traversing the graph with its adjacency information, visualized above. The term
is a making graph cut and it would be challenging to do quickly and in parallel
on a GPU.</p>
<p dir="auto">We ideally want to test whether to render a cluster independently. We could
render geometry where its error is the first below the threshold, i.e. its
decimated error is greater. Just that would actually guarantee no holes, but
there would still be overlaps. E.g. two clusters that represent the same surface
being drawn at once. This can happen when the bounding sphere of a decimated
group is so far from the camera that its conservative angular error is smaller
than a group's angular error that it was decimated from.</p>
<p dir="auto">The solution implemented by this library is to artificially increase the size of
the bounding spheres such that the nearest point to the camera is always nearer
than that on a bounding sphere of its generating geometry. In short, make
bounding spheres bound generating geometry too. Once done, a single watertight
mesh can be stitched together from independent parallel decisions. In general,
the angular error, or whatever metric is compared to a threshold, must never
decrease with each level of decimation. The failure above was a decrease due to
the size distortion of a perspective projection.</p>
<p dir="auto">One derivation glossed over so far is why store bounding spheres and errors per
group. The simple answer is that for LOD transitions to work, the entire group
must change LOD at the same time, so all clusters in a group must share the same
values.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Spatial Hierarchy</h3><a id="user-content-spatial-hierarchy" aria-label="Permalink: Spatial Hierarchy" href="#spatial-hierarchy"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">This library provides a spatial hierarchy of bounding spheres to search for
cluster groups of the right LOD in the right spatial region relative to the
camera.</p>
<p dir="auto">One way to think of this is there are many high-detailed clusters and few low
detail. If an object is far away, only the low-detailed clusters should be
checked. That is, the search can exit early if it is known that all remaining
clusters are too detailed.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/nvpro-samples/nv_cluster_lod_builder/blob/main/doc/spatial_selection.svg"><img src="https://github.com/nvpro-samples/nv_cluster_lod_builder/raw/main/doc/spatial_selection.svg" alt=""></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Another way of thinking about this is at a certain distance range from the
camera, as shown in the image above, only clusters with certain bounding sphere
radii and quadric error ranges should be rendered. Thus, the search space can be
reduced by conservatively searching only that region. An r-tree could work well
here too.</p>
<p dir="auto">The hierarchy is actually a set of hierarchies - one for each LOD level. For
convenience, per-level roots are merged since the application would need to
search all levels anyway, or at least their roots.</p>
<p dir="auto">Leaf nodes point to cluster groups and are initialized with the group's
decimated cluster maximum quadric error (i.e. from the next level*) and the
group's bounding sphere. The hierarchy is built by recursively spatially
clustering nodes - not fast, but it works and it isn't a bottleneck yet.
Internal nodes are given the maximum quadric error and bounding sphere of their
children.</p>
<p dir="auto">*The group quadric error is the error of the generated group's clusters, i.e.
after decimation, not the error in the group's clusters. This avoids
unnecessarily storing a per-cluster error.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/nvpro-samples/nv_cluster_lod_builder/blob/main/doc/hierarchy_selection.svg"><img src="https://github.com/nvpro-samples/nv_cluster_lod_builder/raw/main/doc/hierarchy_selection.svg" alt=""></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The tree can be traversed using the same angular error check as for cluster
groups, exiting when the node's error is less than the threshold. The trees for
LODs with too fine detail will exit early. The blue crosses in the above image
show an example - those nodes are already below the threshold. Since traversed
leaf nodes have already been checked to be above the threshold, and they are
initialized with cluster's generated group's error, their clusters only need to
check that they are below the threshold in order to select them for rendering.
Note that the entire group may not necessarily be drawn. For example, two of the
yellow clusters were not below the threshold (red cross). This same check is
made by the blue group's leaf node and blue clusters are drawn instead.</p>
<p dir="auto">While it is possible to exit early from a tree with too coarse detail, it may
interfere with streaming, depending on how dependencies are implemented.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Streaming</h3><a id="user-content-streaming" aria-label="Permalink: Streaming" href="#streaming"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">This is not a definitive how-to, but outlines some ideas for getting started
with streaming continuous LOD.</p>
<p dir="auto">The first feature needed for streaming is indirection - e.g. pointers to cluster
groups that are initially null and can be populated over time (outside of
cluster selection and rendering). Then, cluster groups in leaf nodes encountered
during hierarchy traversal must be marked and streamed in. Finally, minor
changes are needed for selecting clusters:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Obviously, don't traverse leaf nodes whose groups have not been loaded yet</li>
<li>Consider clusters to be below the threshold if their generating group has not been loaded</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Choosing to keep lower detail geometry loaded greatly simplifies things. That
is, making sure decimated geometry is loaded first. This happens naturally due
to traversal order, but tracking dependencies host side may be needed if
streaming less than everything-at-once from traversal.</p>
<p dir="auto">Initially, streaming at the granularity of cluster groups and using the
generated group indices directly as dependencies is straight forward. Cluster
groups could also be combined for coarser streaming granularity, with a new set
of dependencies.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Simple Streaming</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Compute per-group needed flags during traversal. Emit load/unload events on
rising/falling edges. Fulfil those events in whole and set or unset the pointers
to the new data between traversal+rendering. Some filtering such as per-group
frame age may be useful to avoid frequently unloading and reloading groups.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Continuous Streaming</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">The simple streaming above has less control over the amount streamed per batch.
This can be improved by adding batch size limits and queues. Note that by
partially streaming will require manually resolving dependency orders. Some
ideas are:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Limit the number of load/unload events emitted per frame</li>
<li>Add a global event queue
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Delay unloads and ignore pulses by comparing events at the front of the
queue with the most recent events inserted into the back of the queue.</li>
<li>Prioritise events by a detail metric so geometry loads evenly on screen</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Set a fixed memory limit (memory pool even) and/or fixed cluster/group count
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Prioritise loading until memory exhausted</li>
<li>Then only unload until memory reclaimed</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To maintain dependency loading in topological order, expand events after the global queue
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Recursively load generated groups first</li>
<li>Unload groups only if it is not a dependency of another group</li>
<li>The order of dependency resolution must not be changed after this step in the pipeline, but batches can still be formed</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Form batches during dependency loading
<ul dir="auto">
<li>The memory limit may be hit during dependency expansion</li>
<li>Must not include load/unload for same item in batch, assuming batches are
executed in parallel</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

&amp;&amp;
errorOverDistance(

    ) < threshold"><pre><span>errorOverDistance</span>(

        hierarchy.groupCumulativeQuadricError[clusterGeneratingGroup]
    ) &lt; threshold</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">The <code>clusterGeneratingGroup</code> is the group from which a cluster was generated by
decimation. E.g. decimating the "generating" group of clusters <em>generates</em>
another a new smaller set of clusters.</p>
<p dir="auto">The <code>groupCumulativeQuadricError</code> is actually the error after its geometry is
decimated, not the error of the group itself's clusters. This value doesn't
exist at the group level, which is the reason for the surprise. The above
conditions gives a band in which cluster are chosen. Their group's decimated
geometry (first check) is closest to but not exceeding the threshold. Their
geometry (second check) does exceed the threshold so they are first past the
threshold. This holds true given some massaging of the bounding spheres to
guarantee the decimated geometry will always pass the threshold before the
geometry itself.</p>
<p dir="auto">The <code>groupCumulativeBoundingSpheres</code> conservatively include their generating
group's bounding spheres. This guarantees that clusters from multiple levels
cannot be rendered at once.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Spatial hierarchy</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Performing a test per cluster would be expensive. Even only testing every unique
group--generating-group pair. This library creates a spatial hierarchy of
bounding spheres to reduce the search space.</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>hierarchy.nodes</code> contains a tree of all clusters. The first node is the root
node. Simply descend while the following condition holds and check all cluster
range nodes when found. It's actually a combination of hierarchies for each LOD
level. The way it works is described below.</p>

      <p><small><span><b>TL;DR</b>: We propose an end-to-end multimodality-conditioned human video generation framework named OmniHuman, which can generate human videos based on a single human image and motion signals (e.g., audio only, video only, or a combination of audio and video). In OmniHuman, we introduce a multimodality motion conditioning mixed training strategy, allowing the model to benefit from data scaling up of mixed conditioning. This overcomes the issue that previous end-to-end approaches faced due to the scarcity of high-quality data. OmniHuman significantly outperforms existing methods, generating extremely realistic human videos based on weak signal inputs, especially audio. It supports image inputs of any aspect ratio, whether they are portraits, half-body, or full-body images, delivering more lifelike and high-quality results across various scenarios.</span></small></p><p><img src="https://omnihuman-lab.github.io/image/overall.png" alt="">
      </p>
    </div><div id="sections">
      <h3>Generated Videos</h3>
        <p>
          OmniHuman supports various visual and audio styles. It can generate realistic human videos <strong>at any aspect ratio and body proportion (portrait, half-body, full-body all in one)</strong>, with realism stemming from comprehensive aspects including motion, lighting, and texture details.<br>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>*</b> Note that to generate all results on this page, <strong>only any single image and audio are required</strong>, except for the demo showcasing video and combined driving signals. For the sake of a clean layout, we have omitted the display of reference images, which are the first frame of the generated video in most cases. If you need comparisons or further information, please do not hesitate to contact us.
        </p>
        
        
      <h3>Singing</h3>
        <p>OmniHuman can support various music styles and accommodate multiple body poses and singing forms. It can handle high-pitched songs and display different motion styles for different types of music. Please remember to select the highest video quality. The generated video quality also highly depends on the quality of the reference image.

      <h3>Talking</h3>
        <p>OmniHuman can support input of any aspect ratio in terms of speech. It significantly improves the handling of gestures, which is a challenge for existing methods, and produces highly realistic results. The audio and images for some of the test cases are sourced from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Jk8qITsqdM&amp;t=127s&amp;ab_channel=TEDxTalks">link1</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITxWUu6UcWQ&amp;t=251s&amp;ab_channel=TEDxTalks">link2</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO8w6XcXJUs&amp;ab_channel=RealTimewithBillMaher">link3</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO8w6XcXJUs&amp;ab_channel=RealTimewithBillMaher">link4</a>.</p>
        
        




      <h3>Diversity</h3>
        <p>In terms of input diversity, OmniHuman supports cartoons, artificial objects, animals, and challenging poses, ensuring motion characteristics match each style's unique features.</p>
        
        


      <h3>More Portrait Cases</h3>
        <p>Here, we also include a section dedicated to portrait aspect ratio results, which are derived from test samples in the <a href="https://celebv-hq.github.io/">CelebV-HQ</a>datasets.</p>
        
        

      <h3>More Halfbody Cases with Hands</h3>
        <p>Here, we also provide additional examples specifically showcasing gesture movements. Some input images and audio come from TED, Pexels and AIGC.</p>
        
        

      <h3>Compatibility with Video Driving</h3>
        <p>Due to OmniHuman's mixed condition training characteristics, it can support not only audio driving but also video driving to mimic specific video actions, as well as combined audio and video driving (case is from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbpNlshqtJc&amp;ab_channel=TED">link</a>) to control specific body parts like recent methods. Below, we demonstrate these capabilities.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="auto"><p>T-HEAD is a wholly owned subsidiary of Alibaba, one of China's largest tech companies. Over the past few years, T-HEAD has created a line of RISC-V cores. Alibaba seems to have two motivations for pushing RISC-V. On one hand, the company stands to benefit from creating cost effective chips optimized for areas it cares about, like IoT endpoints and edge computing. On the other, Alibaba almost certainly wants to reduce its dependence on foreign imports. RISC-V is an open instruction set, and isn't controlled by US or British corporations like x86-64 or ARM. T-HEAD's RISC-V push can thus be seen more broadly as a part of China's push to create viable domestic microchips.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1d7bf8f2-eda4-43cf-b2c2-fb01be36bb36_1492x835.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1d7bf8f2-eda4-43cf-b2c2-fb01be36bb36_1492x835.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1d7bf8f2-eda4-43cf-b2c2-fb01be36bb36_1492x835.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1d7bf8f2-eda4-43cf-b2c2-fb01be36bb36_1492x835.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1d7bf8f2-eda4-43cf-b2c2-fb01be36bb36_1492x835.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1d7bf8f2-eda4-43cf-b2c2-fb01be36bb36_1492x835.png" width="1456" height="815" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1d7bf8f2-eda4-43cf-b2c2-fb01be36bb36_1492x835.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:815,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1d7bf8f2-eda4-43cf-b2c2-fb01be36bb36_1492x835.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1d7bf8f2-eda4-43cf-b2c2-fb01be36bb36_1492x835.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1d7bf8f2-eda4-43cf-b2c2-fb01be36bb36_1492x835.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1d7bf8f2-eda4-43cf-b2c2-fb01be36bb36_1492x835.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Xuantie C910 slots into the "high performance" category within T-HEAD's lineup. Besides joining a small number of out-of-order RISC-V cores that have made it into hardware, C910 is an early adopter for RISC-V's vector extension. It supports RVV 0.7.1, which features masking and variable vector length support.

It's also T-HEAD's first generation out-of-order design, so taking on all those applications is ambitious. C910 is implemented in clusters of up to four cores, each with a shared L2 cache. T-HEAD targets 2 to 2.5 GHz on TSMC's 12nm FinFET process, where a C910 core occupies 0.8 mm</span><sup>2</sup><span>. Core voltage is 0.8V at 2 GHz, and 1.0V at 2.5 GHz. On TSMC's 7nm process, T-HEAD managed to push core frequency to 2.8 GHz. T-HEAD's paper further claims dynamic power is around 100 microwatts/MHz, which works out to 0.2W at 2 GHz. Of course, this figure doesn't include static power or power draw outside the core. Yet all of these characteristics together make clear C910 is a low power, low area design.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e13f891-3cca-494d-83e0-ae2c6d151968_631x489.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e13f891-3cca-494d-83e0-ae2c6d151968_631x489.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e13f891-3cca-494d-83e0-ae2c6d151968_631x489.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e13f891-3cca-494d-83e0-ae2c6d151968_631x489.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e13f891-3cca-494d-83e0-ae2c6d151968_631x489.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e13f891-3cca-494d-83e0-ae2c6d151968_631x489.png" width="631" height="489" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1e13f891-3cca-494d-83e0-ae2c6d151968_631x489.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:489,&quot;width&quot;:631,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:521240,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e13f891-3cca-494d-83e0-ae2c6d151968_631x489.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e13f891-3cca-494d-83e0-ae2c6d151968_631x489.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e13f891-3cca-494d-83e0-ae2c6d151968_631x489.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e13f891-3cca-494d-83e0-ae2c6d151968_631x489.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>This article will examine C910 in the T-HEAD TH1520, using the LicheePi single board computer.

The core has a 64 KB, 2-way set associative instruction cache with a FIFO replacement policy. Besides caching instruction data, C910 stores four bits of predecode data for each possible 16-bit instruction slot. Two bits tentatively indicate whether an instruction starts at that position, while the other two provide branch info.

Output from the 8-wide decode block that processed the correct way is passed to the next stage, while output from the other 8-wide decoder is discarded.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F10582ce7-1c83-4f8b-9d57-18e9d7c20e22_461x484.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F10582ce7-1c83-4f8b-9d57-18e9d7c20e22_461x484.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F10582ce7-1c83-4f8b-9d57-18e9d7c20e22_461x484.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F10582ce7-1c83-4f8b-9d57-18e9d7c20e22_461x484.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F10582ce7-1c83-4f8b-9d57-18e9d7c20e22_461x484.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F10582ce7-1c83-4f8b-9d57-18e9d7c20e22_461x484.png" width="461" height="484" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/10582ce7-1c83-4f8b-9d57-18e9d7c20e22_461x484.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:484,&quot;width&quot;:461,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:88646,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F10582ce7-1c83-4f8b-9d57-18e9d7c20e22_461x484.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F10582ce7-1c83-4f8b-9d57-18e9d7c20e22_461x484.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F10582ce7-1c83-4f8b-9d57-18e9d7c20e22_461x484.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F10582ce7-1c83-4f8b-9d57-18e9d7c20e22_461x484.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>C910’s main branch predictor mechanisms also sit at the IP stage. Conditional branches are handled with a </span><a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~kubitron/courses/cs152-S04/handouts/papers/p4-lee.pdf" rel="">bi-mode predictor</a><span>, with a 1024 entry selection table, two 16384 entry history tables containing 2-bit counters, and a 22-bit global history register. The selection table is indexed by hashing the low bits of the branch address and global history register, while the history tables are indexed by hashing the high hits of the history register. Output from the selection table is used to pick between the two history tables, labeled “taken” and “ntaken”. Returns are handled using a 12 entry return stack, while a 256 entry indirect target array handles indirect branches. In all, the branch predictor uses approximately 17.3 KB of storage. It’s therefore a small branch predictor by today’s standards, well suited to C910’s low power and low area design goals. For perspective, a high performance core like Qualcomm’s Oryon uses 80 KB for its conditional (direction) predictor alone, and another 40 KB for the indirect predictor.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F638c7314-8c3e-4fae-941a-d076d168ee05_1434x717.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F638c7314-8c3e-4fae-941a-d076d168ee05_1434x717.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F638c7314-8c3e-4fae-941a-d076d168ee05_1434x717.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F638c7314-8c3e-4fae-941a-d076d168ee05_1434x717.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F638c7314-8c3e-4fae-941a-d076d168ee05_1434x717.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F638c7314-8c3e-4fae-941a-d076d168ee05_1434x717.png" width="1434" height="717" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/638c7314-8c3e-4fae-941a-d076d168ee05_1434x717.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:717,&quot;width&quot;:1434,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:347631,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F638c7314-8c3e-4fae-941a-d076d168ee05_1434x717.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F638c7314-8c3e-4fae-941a-d076d168ee05_1434x717.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F638c7314-8c3e-4fae-941a-d076d168ee05_1434x717.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F638c7314-8c3e-4fae-941a-d076d168ee05_1434x717.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Testing with random patterns of various lengths shows C910 can deal with moderately long patterns.

This stage’s job is to smooth out instruction delivery, covering any hiccups in frontend bandwidth as best as it can. To do this, the IB stage has a 32 entry instruction queue and a separate 16 entry loop buffer. Both have 16-bit entries, so 32-bit instructions will take two slots. C910’s loop buffer serves the same purpose as Pentium 4’s trace cache, seeking to fill in lost frontend slots after a taken branch.

All decode slots can emit 1-2 micro-ops for simpler instructions, though the decode stage in total can’t emit more than four micro-ops per cycle. Output micro-ops are packed into a 178-bit format, and passed directly to the rename stage. C910 does not have a micro-op queue between the decoders and renamers like many other cores. Rename width and decoder output width therefore have to match, explaining why the renamer is 4-wide and why the decoders are restricted to 4 micro-ops per cycle.

Both ports can handle the most common floating point operations like adds, multiplies, and fused multiply. Both pipes can handle 128-bit vector operations too. Feeding each port requires up to four inputs from the FP/vector register file. A fused multiply instruction (a*b+c) requires three inputs. A fourth input provides a mask register. Unlike AVX-512 and SVE, RISC-V doesn’t define separate mask registers, so all inputs have to come from the FP/vector register file.

C910’s L1 DTLB has 17 entries and is fully associative. A 1024 entry, 4-way L2 TLB handles L1 TLB misses for both data and instruction accesses, and adds 4 cycles latency over a L1 hit. Physically, the L2 TLB has two banks, both 256×84 SRAM instances. The tag array is a 256×196 bit SRAM instance, and a 196-bit access includes tags for all four ways along with four “FIFO” bits, possibly used to implement a FIFO replacement policy. Besides necessary info like the virtual page number and a valid bit, each tag includes an address space ID and a global bit. These can exempt an entry from certain TLB flushes, reducing TLB thrashing on context switches. In total, the L2 TLB’s tags and data require 8.96 KB of bit storage.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa7ef3812-c2ae-438b-af84-1ae0c1011204_522x166.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa7ef3812-c2ae-438b-af84-1ae0c1011204_522x166.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa7ef3812-c2ae-438b-af84-1ae0c1011204_522x166.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa7ef3812-c2ae-438b-af84-1ae0c1011204_522x166.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa7ef3812-c2ae-438b-af84-1ae0c1011204_522x166.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa7ef3812-c2ae-438b-af84-1ae0c1011204_522x166.png" width="522" height="166" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a7ef3812-c2ae-438b-af84-1ae0c1011204_522x166.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:166,&quot;width&quot;:522,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa7ef3812-c2ae-438b-af84-1ae0c1011204_522x166.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa7ef3812-c2ae-438b-af84-1ae0c1011204_522x166.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa7ef3812-c2ae-438b-af84-1ae0c1011204_522x166.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa7ef3812-c2ae-438b-af84-1ae0c1011204_522x166.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Physical addresses are written into the load and store queues, depending on whether the address is a load or store.

However, forwarding fails if a load crosses a 16B aligned boundary, or a store crosses a 8B aligned boundary. Failed store forwarding results in a 20+ cycle penalty.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb73fedc-d6e8-4202-a6db-732719fe0ffa_2560x1261.webp" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb73fedc-d6e8-4202-a6db-732719fe0ffa_2560x1261.webp 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb73fedc-d6e8-4202-a6db-732719fe0ffa_2560x1261.webp 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb73fedc-d6e8-4202-a6db-732719fe0ffa_2560x1261.webp 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb73fedc-d6e8-4202-a6db-732719fe0ffa_2560x1261.webp 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb73fedc-d6e8-4202-a6db-732719fe0ffa_2560x1261.webp" width="1456" height="717" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/bb73fedc-d6e8-4202-a6db-732719fe0ffa_2560x1261.webp&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:717,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1697102,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/webp&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb73fedc-d6e8-4202-a6db-732719fe0ffa_2560x1261.webp 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb73fedc-d6e8-4202-a6db-732719fe0ffa_2560x1261.webp 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb73fedc-d6e8-4202-a6db-732719fe0ffa_2560x1261.webp 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb73fedc-d6e8-4202-a6db-732719fe0ffa_2560x1261.webp 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>C910 handles unaligned accesses well, unlike P550. If a load doesn’t cross a 16B boundary or a store doesn’t cross a 8B boundary, it’s basically free. If you do cross those alignment boundaries, you don’t face a performance penalty beyond making an extra L1D access under the hood. Overall, C910’s load/store unit and forwarding behavior is a bit short of the most recent cores from Intel and AMD. But it’s at about the same level as AMD’s Piledriver, a very advanced and high performance core in its own right. That’s a good place to be.</p><p>The 64 KB, 2-way data cache has 3 cycle latency, and is divided into 4 byte wide banks. It can handle up to one load and one store per cycle, though 128-bit stores take two cycles. L1D tags are split into two separate arrays, one for loads and one for stores.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F19c31aba-3418-453e-9677-21ebe7a66821_464x564.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F19c31aba-3418-453e-9677-21ebe7a66821_464x564.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F19c31aba-3418-453e-9677-21ebe7a66821_464x564.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F19c31aba-3418-453e-9677-21ebe7a66821_464x564.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F19c31aba-3418-453e-9677-21ebe7a66821_464x564.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F19c31aba-3418-453e-9677-21ebe7a66821_464x564.png" width="464" height="564" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/19c31aba-3418-453e-9677-21ebe7a66821_464x564.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:564,&quot;width&quot;:464,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:82376,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F19c31aba-3418-453e-9677-21ebe7a66821_464x564.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F19c31aba-3418-453e-9677-21ebe7a66821_464x564.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F19c31aba-3418-453e-9677-21ebe7a66821_464x564.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F19c31aba-3418-453e-9677-21ebe7a66821_464x564.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Data cache misses are tracked by one of eight line-fill buffer entries, which store the miss address. Refill data is held in two 512-bit wide fill buffer registers. Like the instruction cache, the data cache uses a simple FIFO replacement policy.</p><p>Each C910 core interfaces with the outside world via a “PIU”, or processor interface unit. At the other end, a C910 cluster has a Consistency Interface Unit (CIU) that accepts requests from up to four PIUs and maintains cache coherency. The CIU is split into two “snb” instances, each of which has a 24 entry request queue. SNB arbitrates between requests based on age, and has a 512-bit interface to the L2 cache.</p><p>C910’s L2 cache acts as both the first stop for L1 misses and as a cluster-wide shared last level cache. On the TH1520, it has 1 MB of capacity and is 16-way set associative with a FIFO replacement policy. To service multiple accesses per cycle, the L2 is built from two banks, selected by bit 6 of the physical address. The L2 is inclusive of upper level caches, and uses ECC protection to ensure data integrity.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50a044a6-61a0-42b6-95f7-eb40de640b9a_641x613.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50a044a6-61a0-42b6-95f7-eb40de640b9a_641x613.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50a044a6-61a0-42b6-95f7-eb40de640b9a_641x613.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50a044a6-61a0-42b6-95f7-eb40de640b9a_641x613.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50a044a6-61a0-42b6-95f7-eb40de640b9a_641x613.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50a044a6-61a0-42b6-95f7-eb40de640b9a_641x613.png" width="641" height="613" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/50a044a6-61a0-42b6-95f7-eb40de640b9a_641x613.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:613,&quot;width&quot;:641,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:100495,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50a044a6-61a0-42b6-95f7-eb40de640b9a_641x613.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50a044a6-61a0-42b6-95f7-eb40de640b9a_641x613.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50a044a6-61a0-42b6-95f7-eb40de640b9a_641x613.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50a044a6-61a0-42b6-95f7-eb40de640b9a_641x613.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>L2 latency is 60 cycles which is problematic for a core with limited reordering capacity and no mid-level cache.

It’s much better than P550, which saw over 300 ns of latency within a quad core cluster.</p><p>C910 is T-HEAD’s first out-of-order core. Right out of the gate, C910 is more polished than P550 in some respects. Core to core latency is better, unaligned accesses are properly handled, and there’s vector support. Like P550, C910 aims to scale across a broad range of low power applications. L2 capacity can be configured up to 8 MB, and multi-cluster setups allow scaling to high core counts. I feel like there’s ambition behind C910, since Alibaba wants to use in-house RISC-V cores instead of depending on external factors.</p><blockquote><p>Alibaba has been promoting Xuantie core IP series to facilitate external customers for edge computing applications, such as AI, edge servers, industrial control and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS)…by the end of 2022, a total volume of 15 million units is expected</p><p>Xuantie-910: A Commercial Multi-Core 12-Stage Pipeline Out-of-Order 64-bit High Performance RISC-V Processor with Vector Extension – T-Head Division, Alibaba Cloud</p></blockquote><p>Yet I also feel the things C910 does well are overshadowed by executing poorly on the basics. The core’s out-of-order engine is poorly balanced, with inadequate capacity in critical structures like the schedulers and register files in relation to its ROB capacity. CPU performance is often limited by memory access performance, and C910’s cache subsystem is exceptionally weak. The cluster’s shared L2 is both slow and small, and the C910 cores have no mid-level cache to insulate L1 misses from that L2. DRAM bandwidth is also lackluster.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F883412d3-684c-49d9-86f5-62d17c21b8af_688x632.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F883412d3-684c-49d9-86f5-62d17c21b8af_688x632.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F883412d3-684c-49d9-86f5-62d17c21b8af_688x632.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F883412d3-684c-49d9-86f5-62d17c21b8af_688x632.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F883412d3-684c-49d9-86f5-62d17c21b8af_688x632.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F883412d3-684c-49d9-86f5-62d17c21b8af_688x632.jpeg" width="688" height="632" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/883412d3-684c-49d9-86f5-62d17c21b8af_688x632.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:632,&quot;width&quot;:688,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F883412d3-684c-49d9-86f5-62d17c21b8af_688x632.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F883412d3-684c-49d9-86f5-62d17c21b8af_688x632.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F883412d3-684c-49d9-86f5-62d17c21b8af_688x632.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F883412d3-684c-49d9-86f5-62d17c21b8af_688x632.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>A TH1520 chip, seen at Hot Chips 2024 (not the one tested)</figcaption></figure></div><p>C910 is therefore caught in a position where it needs to keep a lot of instructions in flight to smooth out spikes in demand for memory bandwidth and mitigate high L2 latency, but can rarely do so in practice because its ROB capacity isn’t supported by other structures. C910’s unaligned access handling, vector support, and decent core-to-core latency are all nice to have. But tackling those edge cases is less important than building a well balanced core supported by a solid memory subsystem. Missing the subset of applications that use unaligned accesses or take advantage of vectorization is one thing. But messing up performance for everything else is another. And C910’s poor L2 and DRAM performance may even limit the usefulness of its vector capabilities, because vectorized applications tend to pull more memory bandwidth.</p><p>Hopefully T-HEAD will use experience gained from C910 to build better cores going forward. With Alibaba behind it, T-HEAD should have massive financial backing. I also hope to see more open source out-of-order cores going forward. Looking through C910 source code was very insightful. I appreciated being able to see how micro-op formats changed between pipeline stages, and how instruction decode is split across several stages that aren’t necessarily labeled “decode”.</p><p><span>If you like the content then consider heading over to the </span><a href="https://www.patreon.com/ChipsandCheese" rel="">Patreon</a><span> or </span><a href="https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=4EMPH66SBGVSQ" rel="">PayPal</a><span> if you want to toss a few bucks to Chips and Cheese.

<p>This isn’t exactly my first time dropping a container full of Chinese electric vehicles in the yard and cracking it open with childlike glee. But it is likely one of the most unique experiences I’ve had so far doing this, revealing inside a fleet of battery-powered Chinese electric mini-excavators and assorted accessories.</p>



<p>If you’ve followed my escapades in my articles and videos for any amount of time, you’ll know this is pretty much par for the course for me. I’m the guy who <a href="https://electrek.co/2022/07/25/electric-mini-truck-how-its-holding-up/">imported that viral $2,000 Chinese electric mini-truck</a> that netted tens of millions of views around the internet. I followed that up with <a href="https://electrek.co/2022/11/21/i-bought-this-electric-boat-alibaba/">electric boats</a> and <a href="https://electrek.co/2023/11/30/i-bought-container-full-of-electric-tractors-and-construction-equipment/">electric tractors</a> and all sorts of <a href="https://electrek.co/2023/05/18/minghong-electric-microcar-unboxing-testing/">other fun EVs</a> from the world’s largest and most controversial electric vehicle market.</p>



<p>This time though, things are getting serious as I get to work. Or, at least work-related vehicles, as my latest import is a pile of electric mini-excavators. So buckle up and join me for the journey! And if you want to see the process in full moving pictures, check out my fun <a href="https://youtu.be/ifQRS5fZCzM">container unboxing video here</a> to get this experience first hand.</p>

<p>In case you’re wondering how I got here, it all started with a need for an electric wheel loader – a type of articulating tractor that is useful for a wide range of land managing tasks like digging, loading, hauling, trenching, towing, and more. </p>	
	



<p>My parents live on a bit of land in Florida and needed a few machines to help keep up with chores around the property. They don’t need a massive tractor, but some modest machines would be a big help.</p>



<p>As it turns out, there actually are a few smaller articulated wheel loaders available for these types of homesteaders and landowners – folks who don’t really need a $50,000 diesel Bobcat like you’d see on a contractor’s job site.</p>



<p>However, the family didn’t really want a diesel machine. With the advent of electric alternatives, the advantages of lower operating costs, safer working environment, reduced maintenance, and quieter/more peaceful operation were too hard to pass up. Our family has an electric mini-truck and an electric UTV, both of which are major work vehicles for us, and the experience has driven home just how much nicer it is to own and operate electric alternatives of common work vehicles.</p>



<p>The problem is that when it comes to electric tractor loaders and electric excavators, there just aren’t many options. Nearly everything out there is diesel. Without finding any options for such machines in the US, I went to the world’s largest electric vehicle maker: China. There I found several options that were a good step in the right direction, but weren’t quite ready for prime time in their existing form. With a good starting point, I worked with a factory that I liked to improve the machines for North American operators. </p>

<p>After making a number of safety, quality, and ergonomic improvements to the equipment, the machines became the first <a href="http://nesherequipment.com/">NESHER electric loaders </a>in a growing lineup. Developing into a small business run by my father and me, we’ve now been able to hire a couple of staff and have since shipped electric machines all over the US.</p>



<p>The next logical step in growing was to expand into dedicated mini-excavators, which could dig deeper and do more than just the excavator attachment available on the NESHER L880 and NESHER L1400 loaders. So I repeated the process but for excavators this time, working with a suitable factory to improve their machines to my ideal design intended to better serve North American users.</p>



<p>Having now gone through this container importing process many times over the last 18 months or so, this time I thought I’d bring you guys along on the process of cracking one of these open.</p>

<p>First of all, any one of these containers takes months to set up. It starts with working with the factory designers and engineers, then negotiating pricing, fronting the production, dealing with inevitable production delays, quality inspections before shipping, booking sea freight, working through customs and handling tariffs, setting up incoming freight, and finally landing the container at your doorstep.</p>



<p>It’s a long and arduous process with each step full of headaches, but having done this with a dozen or so containers at this point, it’s starting to become easier and smoother.</p>



<p>When the container finally arrives after those many months of work, the real fun starts. I cracked this one open and got to work unloading the crates of mini-excavator attachments, such as grapples, augers, ripper teeth, various buckets sizes, rock hammers, etc.</p>



<p>Next came the machines themselves. I always make sure my factories package my machines extra well. It’s not as much the long ocean journey I’m worried about, which is relatively gentle. Rather, the first and last few hundred miles on the back of a truck chassis can bounce things around more. We use a spiderweb of strapping and a small army of ratchets to ensure every machine and attachment is safe and secure for the journey.</p>



<p>They are each unloaded down the ramps and go through an initial quick inspection looking for any obvious issues, like problems with the hydraulics or tracks, then driven off to staging. Once all of the machines are out and the container is cleared out, the more intensive inspections begin. Each machine is put through a few hours of work to suss out any potential issues that were missed at the factory. Occasionally this turns up something small, but thorough quality inspections at the factory mean that any real issues get caught before they arrive stateside.</p>

<p>I’d be lying if I said the inspection process isn’t fun, because it basically means we get to play around with all of the functions. And there’s something about digging holes with small-format heavy equipment that just brings out the inner child in you.</p>



<p>These are fairly small machines – the NESHER NX2500 model name hints at the 2,500 lb (1.1 metric ton) weight of the mini-excavator. With a 5.5-foot (167 cm) digging depth, they are great for tasks such as landscaping jobs like tree planting, utility work like trench digging, material handling like loading and unloading gravel, logs, etc., and even light demolition work. They are especially useful for indoor demolition and renovation jobs, since their zero-emission operation means that operators don’t have to run a long exhaust hose to pipe out the poisonous diesel exhaust or risk the health of anyone in the building.</p>



<p>However, the small size of the machines means that they aren’t really meant for major jobs. You could dig a pond, but it’d take a pretty darn long time.</p>



<p>To give you an example, a few days ago I dug a couple of holes for some palm trees we’ll be adding to the property, and the charge on the machine dropped by 2%. That doesn’t necessarily mean it will be a linear drop and that you can dig 100 holes on a charge, but it’s a rough approximation. </p>



<p>With a 48V 200Ah Li-ion battery, the 9.6 kWh battery is sufficiently large for up to 5-6 hours of light-duty operation, though digging through dense material like clay or rocky terrain will reduce the run time. Recharging takes around 7 hours via a 120V wall outlet with the included charger. </p>



<p>Again, this isn’t meant for an 8-hour shift on a job site. These are machines largely intended for landowners and homesteaders who often have digging tasks but don’t want to repeatedly rent a machine – not that you could find an electric mini-excavator to rent, anyway. Seriously, give it a try. If you want to buy or rent an electric mini-excavator in the US, there simply aren’t any options. They don’t exist. Or at least, they didn’t.</p>



<p>There are a few major companies that have begun producing them in very limited numbers, such as JCB, Bobcat, etc. But they are largely unobtanium, only available to contractors, and carry pricetags approaching and exceeding six figures.</p>

<h2 id="h-common-questions-about-the-electric-mini-excavators">Common questions about the electric mini-excavators</h2>



<p>The most common questions I get on these are run time and cost. With the 6-hour answer out of the way, that leaves pricing. To frame this answer, it’s important to understand what prices look like in this industry. There are VERY few sources for electric mini-excavators anywhere in the Western World. The <a href="https://www.jcb.com/en-us/products/compact-excavators/19c-1e">JCB 19C-1E</a> is one of the few options out there. Traditional heavy equipment companies don’t publicly share prices. You have to jump through hoops of JCB sales reps before they finally tell you that is a nearly US $100,000 machine.</p>



<p>But that machine also weighs around 1,500 lb more than the NESHER NX2500. A closer comparison would be the <a href="https://www.bobcat.com/na/en/equipment/excavators/compact-excavators/e10e">Bobcat E10e</a>, which is roughly the same size and spec as the NESHER NX2500. Again, it takes a lot of digging (no pun intended), but ultimately you’ll find that it is priced at around US $60,000.</p>



<p>By comparison, the NESHER NX2500 is priced at <a href="http://www.nesherequipment.com/">US $19,600</a>. </p>



<p>This isn’t to say that these machines are directly comparable, but they do have similar specs and perform similar tasks. Bobcat and JCB are certainly larger companies, but they cater to commercial users. The NX2500, on the other hand, finally brings the capability of electric mini-excavators to more average Joes and small businesses that can’t afford a $60k or $100k piece of equipment.</p>

<p>Another common question I get when people hear I import a lot of these types of things is “do you get to keep the container?”</p>



<p>Sometimes, yes. But it’s not as much that I <em>get</em> to keep and more that I had to buy it in advance. This is what is known as one-tripper. That means it is a new shipping container, and this is its first trip across the ocean. </p>



<p>In this case, I bought the container so I could keep it and use it as storage – basically a super sturdy and locking shed. You might have seen my article about turning a shipping container into <a href="https://electrek.co/2024/08/26/i-run-my-electric-tractor-completely-off-grid-heres-my-secret/">a solar-powered charging shed </a>complete with air conditioning. That’s one of the nice things about choosing to buy a one-tripper container, you can get very creative with them. </p>



<p>However, most of my imports are done using the shipping line containers. These are essentially borrowed from the container lines. Maersk or MSC or the other big names lend you a shipping container as part of the price of shipping with them, you fill it in China, empty it in the US, and then it goes back to the port for many more journeys in its future. That’s the most common and economical way to do it, but getting a few shipping containers of your own isn’t a bad thing either, if you have the space.</p>

<p>The last question that I often hear is simply, “Why electric?”</p>



<p>I get it, many old-school operators are of the “diesel or die” variety. The problem is, sometimes you get both. That diesel exhaust is a carcinogen. And unlike larger excavators with enclosed cabs and better exhaust manifold designs, most diesel-powered open-cab mini-excavators result in the operator’s face being located a mere 2-3 feet from a diesel exhaust pipe. That’s not how I want to spend my digging hours and I wouldn’t wish it upon anyone else.</p>



<p>Then you have to add on top of that the sound of an unisolated engine running inches beneath your thighs, the vibrations of that engine, the extended upkeep and maintenance of an engine with hundreds of moving parts, and the hassle of winterizing or other extra steps that required to keep such machines in good working order.</p>



<p>There’s a reason a power drill has a battery and an electric motor instead of a small gasoline engine, even though such engines are widely available for model building. Electric tools are simply nicer and more convenient to own and operate. Sure, 30 years ago we didn’t have the kind of motor and battery technology to make electric construction equipment a viable alternative. But now we do, and these machines are proof of it.</p>




	<p>Are they more expensive than a no-name diesel-powered Chinese mini-excavator bought at auction for $5,200? Sure. But they are also cheaper to operate, longer lasting, safer, and more comfortable, and come backed by a US distributor with service and support, including a local inventory of spare parts. Electric might not be for everyone, but it is for me, and now I’ve seen how it is for many others as well.</p>

<p>This is unlikely to be the last time I import something fun and interesting from China, though it certainly is the last one without new tariffs that were recently imposed. Like all businesses, we’ll be analyzing the impact of the new tariffs on our own operating costs, and unfortunately, we may have to raise prices on these machines as our costs rise.</p>



<p>But since a lot of what I bring in is for personal use (and I’ve got more fun EVs already in the works!), that’s largely a problem for me to deal with.</p>



<p>I’m looking forward to sharing the next fun EVs I get my hands on. Until then, I’ll have those hands busy digging!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://travisbumgarner.dev/blog/leaving-aws">https://travisbumgarner.dev/blog/leaving-aws</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42927172">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post"><p><time>Posted <!-- -->Thu Jan 30 2025</time></p><p>I love building side projects. They've been a way to push myself and explore new ideas and technologies. Each site has needed hosting. I started my hosting journey with WordPress. I moved on to raw Linux servers and finally ended up on AWS. Hosting on AWS felt like a badge of honor, but it also felt like a ticking time bomb of complexity and cost.</p>
<h3>Surprise Bills</h3>
<p>I've heard horror stories of accidental bills. They ranged from a few hundred to several hundred thousand dollars. Sometimes they're refunded, like when the story hits the front page of Hacker News and Reddit, but most times not.</p>
<p>I searched for ways to control my financial exposure on AWS. I expected a simple monthly max spend option. I found none. There were mentions of setting up alerts. What if I got DDoSed at 3 a.m.? Some suggested setting up intricate systems to shut everything down. What if they were setup incorrectly?</p>
<h3>Over-Engineered Messes</h3>
<p>I have noticed that we as engineers have a tendency over-engineer systems. We tend to mimic the practices of companies like Facebook or Netflix. We over-engineer solutions, choosing technologies that are often overkill for our actual needs. For me, AWS was far more than I needed.</p>
<h3>NearlyFreeSpeech to the Rescue</h3>
<p>After some research and conversations with other engineers, I discovered <a href="https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net/">NearlyFreeSpeech</a> (NFS). Their approach to hosting was exactly what I was looking for. One blog post stood out to me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“[…] since our service is paid in advance, you always have complete control over your maximum financial liability simply by controlling the balance of your account. If you feel your site is attack-prone and you are primarily concerned about costs, we encourage you to maintain a low account balance to limit your exposure.” - <a href="https://faq.nearlyfreespeech.net/q/attack">Blog Post</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This model was perfect. By prepaying, I could ensure complete control over my financial liability.</p>
<p>It's possible with NFS to setup several billing accounts with prepaid balances. I have a primary account that I add a few dollars to each month. This is hosting for my portfolio websites and some stable side projects. I have a secondary account for experimental projects. I can add some more money and tinker without the worry of spending too much.</p>
<p>The NFS dashboard is simple and straightforward. Everything is a button click or two away - the bills, what's enabled, what's not, what's working, what's not and why.</p>
<p>Linux boxes leave it up to you to do everything. AWS offers way too many ways to do things in way too complicated of manners. NFS offers some boilerplate and opinions for each server that gets the best of both of these worlds.</p>
<h3>Moving Apps</h3>
<p>In total, I migrated eight of nine apps to NFS.</p>
<p>One app gave me trouble - a Python Flask app. It had several complicated dependencies including OpenCV, Numpy, and Matplotlib. My belief is that this had more to do with the complex nature of the libraries and less to do with NFS.</p>
<p>For implementation notes and pull requests, scroll down to the Migration section.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>I still think AWS holds a place and I'll most likely use it as a tool in the future. But for now, I'm going to keep things simple simple.</p>
<p>My bill has increased from about $1 to $7 a month. I'm content to pay a few dollars more a month for peace of mind and to support a smaller business.</p>
<h2>Migration Guide</h2>
<h3>Pull Requests</h3>
<p>Preface - I bit off more than I could chew. I migrated 8 sites at once. There were several follow up PRs to correct some things that slipped through the cracks.</p>
<p>Listed below are the eight websites I migrated. The website, pull requests, technologies used, and some notes are included.</p>

<h3>Migration (or Creation) Process</h3>
<p>Reference the pull requests and code in the previous section for examples.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Build your Website</strong></li>
<li><strong>Write a <code>run.sh</code> Script</strong>
<ul>
<li>This script will be responsible for bringing up your app.</li>
<li>For multiple apps (e.g., frontend and backend), create separate scripts for each.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Configure site on NFS</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Choose Server Type:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Use <code>Apache 2.4 Static Content</code> for frontend apps (like React without a server).</li>
<li>Use <code>Custom</code> for backend apps (e.g., Express, Next.js, Python).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Set Up Daemon(s):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Daemons manage the <code>run.sh</code> scripts and keep your app running.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Set Up Proxy(s):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Expose the necessary ports to the outside world.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Set Up SSH:</strong>

<p>Today, the Video Game History Foundation launches early access to its digital archive of video game history research materials, available now at <a href="https://library.gamehistory.org/">library.gamehistory.org</a>.</p>



<p>Ever since we started in 2017, the Video Game History Foundation has been building a digital library to help the study of video game history. We’ve been collecting development documents, behind-the-scenes content, rare video game publications and catalogs, magazines, memorabilia, ephemera, and more.</p>



<p>After years of cataloging, processing, and digitizing our collections, we’re ready to open our (virtual) doors to the public for the first time.</p>

</p></figure>



<h2>Our collections</h2>



<p>Our digital library platform launches with access to a curated selection of materials from our library, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>Never-before-seen game development materials.</li>



<li>Artwork, press kits, and promotional materials from iconic video games.</li>



<li>Over 1500 full-text searchable <a href="https://archive.gamehistory.org/folder/205c628c-5d0a-4de8-a5a5-782f31706ac0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">out-of-print video game magazines</a>—including game industry trade magazines rarely available to the public.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Learn how games were made</h3>



<p>VGHF works with the game development community to preserve design documents, artwork, video footage, correspondence, and other unique items from behind the scenes of game production.</p>



<p>Now we’re opening these resources for you, and you can discover for yourself how games were made and sold.</p>



<p>The highlight of our launch collection is <a href="https://library.gamehistory.org/repositories/2/resources/84" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Mark Flitman papers</a>. Mark is a retired game producer who worked at companies like Konami, Acclaim, Midway, and Mindscape in the 90s and 2000s. <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/the-collectors-who-save-video-game-history-from-oblivion" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">He and his family graciously invited the Video Game History Foundation to his home</a> and allowed us to digitize and share the mountains of paperwork and digital file backups he’s kept in his basement for over two decades.</p>



<p>Even if you don’t know the games he worked on—and you probably know a few!—his papers are an incredible record of the business of video game production and marketing.</p>

<p>Our library also premieres with <a href="https://archive.gamehistory.org/folder/22cf9aa2-812b-4f39-b42e-e87a3c153b8c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 100 hours of footage from the production of the <em>Myst</em> series</a> by developer Cyan, including the original FMV filming footage for <em>Myst</em> and <em>Riven: The Sequel to Myst</em> and hours of never-before-seen interviews with the Cyan team. We digitized these in support of the upcoming film <em><a href="https://themystdocumentary.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Myst Documentary</a></em>; Cyan has been unbelievably supportive of our mission and has given us unprecedented access to their internal archives to share these videos with you.</p>



<h3>Collaborating with the community</h3>



<p>Fans around the world have been collecting, preserving, documenting game history. We’re helping build their work into something even more impactful.</p>



<p>Many items in our digital library were donated or digitized by members of the gaming community. Hundreds of magazine scans were provided by groups like <a href="https://www.retromags.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Retromags</a> and <a href="https://www.outofprintarchive.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Out-of-Print Archive</a>. Other exciting items, like <a href="https://archive.gamehistory.org/item/9a06fb86-5ed9-4ddd-8f7f-f57dd3b94c1d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a rare educational game catalog</a> and <a href="https://archive.gamehistory.org/folder/719e9f8b-eb62-41aa-81e9-85336daf1d65" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an early electronic game commercial</a>, were loaned to us by private collectors who wanted to make them available for everyone.</p>



<p>The VGHF Library is a force multiplier for citizen archivists who have been preserving the history of games. We’re excited to formally recognize and institutionalize their work.</p>



<h3>And that’s not all!</h3>



<p>The launch of the VGHF Library also includes:</p>



<ul>
<li>The first 100 CDs from <a href="https://archive.gamehistory.org/folder/a5823d80-320b-41c9-9e3c-4dc28f79f2a2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the art and press release archives of <em>GamePro</em> magazine</a>, reformatted to view in your browser.</li>



<li><a href="https://archive.gamehistory.org/folder/1c21011a-6e22-4c3e-9298-c2f71470e1de" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Guidebooks and ephemera from video game events</a>, including searchable directories and maps from the first 12 years of the Electronic Entertainment Expo.</li>



<li>An extensive international collection of <a href="https://archive.gamehistory.org/folder/4d999ce2-81f1-45fe-b103-f50a00e8283f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FromSoftware promotional materials</a>, collected by citizen archivist Kris Urquhart, with a blessing from FromSoftware to donate them to our library!</li>



<li>And much more!</li>
</ul>

<h2>Meet our library system</h2>



<p>Our digital library system makes it easier than ever to explore video game history. We’ve spent years creating rich, extensive metadata for our collections and figuring out how to share our library materials with you. What we’ve built is more than just a bunch of files: This is a powerful tool for video game research with best-in-class discovery features.</p>



<p>Our library is powered by ArchivesSpace and Preservica, two archival management platforms that we use to catalog, preserve, and share our materials. Using the power of these professional-grade archive tools, you can search and filter our collections in deep detail and view digital items directly in-browser.</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://gamehistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/digitalarchive_search-1024x576.png" alt="A screenshot from the Video Game History Foundation's digital archive system. A search for Baldur's Gate has returned 775 items, and each result shows where the phrase &quot;Baldur's Gate&quot; appears in the text of the item." srcset="https://gamehistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/digitalarchive_search-1024x576.png 1024w, https://gamehistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/digitalarchive_search-300x169.png 300w, https://gamehistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/digitalarchive_search-740x416.png 740w, https://gamehistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/digitalarchive_search-768x432.png 768w, https://gamehistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/digitalarchive_search-50x28.png 50w, https://gamehistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/digitalarchive_search-1600x900.png 1600w, https://gamehistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/digitalarchive_search-1536x864.png 1536w, https://gamehistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/digitalarchive_search-1200x675.png 1200w, https://gamehistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/digitalarchive_search.png 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>


<p>We’ve also built our own tools to make the library experience even better. We developed a state-of-the-art text recognition toolset that makes even the wildest, weirdest video game magazines and promotional materials fully text-searchable. And we’ve created <a href="https://archive.gamehistory.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our own digital archive portal</a> with the powerful search and navigation features that video game historians have asked us for.</p>



<p>There has never been a better way to research video game history. By putting our rich collections in conversation with each other in a curated, text-searchable archive, we’ve turned them into a powerful, one-of-a-kind resource.</p>



<p>Our library is for anyone who wants to study video game history—whether you’re a scholar who wants to supplement your academic resources, or a YouTuber making a video about the story of your favorite game.

<h2>Testimonials for the VGHF Library</h2>



<div>
<blockquote>
<p>The Video Game History Foundation Library is a tremendous resource for my research. Being able to look at magazines, press releases, developer documents, and advertisements all in one place and fully searchable is a huge time saver. And by studying a video game through this rich variety of sources, I’m able, as a historian, to see the history of that game in a new way. I’m excited to see the Video Game History Foundation Library grow and I can’t wait to see what else is added in the future.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>―Norm Caruso, video essayist, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@GamingHistorian" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Gaming Historian</em></a></p>



<blockquote>
<p>At Digital Eclipse, we start every one of our interactive documentary games with a huge deep dive into the research, and to have this all at our fingertips—design documents, and press releases, and internal stuff, and magazines—it’s incredible.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>―Chris Kohler, Editorial Director, <a href="https://www.digitaleclipse.com/">Digital Eclipse</a></p>



<blockquote>
<p>If I’m trying to find the earliest use of a word or the earliest news related to a game, it’s a relief when I sort by date in the Foundation’s library, I can trust that all the dates are actually correct. In other databases, the details are frequently entered incorrectly, if any date was entered at all.</p>

<h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>



<h3>Is this everything you have?</h3>



<p>Our archive portal only includes items that have been processed and have a digital copy available to the public. We are actively working to catalog and digitize as much of our collection as possible, and more materials will be coming to the library on an ongoing basis. For a more complete list of VGHF’s holdings, visit the <a href="https://library.gamehistory.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Library Catalog</a> and the “<a href="https://library.gamehistory.org/accessions">Unprocessed Materials</a>” section.</p>



<h3>Do you really have everything here?</h3>



<p>Yes! Every item listed in the library is held by the Video Game History Foundation, or if we do not own a physical copy, VGHF has received permission from a donor to share a digital copy of their material.</p>



<h3>Are you allowed to do this?</h3>



<p>Yes. The VGHF Library follows <a href="https://copyrightalliance.org/faqs/what-is-fair-use/">the guidelines for fair use in U.S. copyright law</a>, which allows us to use copyrighted material for transformative, educational purposes that do not impact the commercial market.

				<h3>from the <i>wake-up</i> dept</h3>
				


				<p>A coup is underway in the United States, and we must stop pretending otherwise. The signs are&nbsp;<strong>unmistakable and accelerating</strong>: in just the past 48 hours, Elon Musk’s DOGE commission has seized control of Treasury payment systems and gained unauthorized access to classified USAID materials, while security officials who followed protocols were removed. Career civil servants across agencies are being systematically purged for having followed legal requirements during previous administrations. The president openly declares he won’t enforce laws he dislikes, while Congress watches in complicit silence. This isn’t happening through tanks in the streets or soldiers at government buildings—it’s occurring through the systematic dismantling of constitutional governance and its replacement with a system of personal loyalty to private interests. Those who resist are being removed, while those who enable this transformation are being rewarded with unprecedented control over government functions. The time for euphemisms and careful hedging has passed. We are watching, in real time, the conversion of constitutional democracy into something darker and more dangerous. To pretend otherwise isn’t prudence—it’s complicity.</p>
<p>I understand why many Americans are hesitant to accept what’s happening—acknowledging the reality of a coup in progress is frightening. But we must confront the facts before us with clear eyes: Donald Trump and Elon Musk are systematically seizing control of the federal government’s machinery through plainly illegal means. They are violating civil service protections established by law, shuttering congressionally mandated agencies without authority, and subjecting career public servants to ideological purges.</p>
<p>When security officials are removed for following classification protocols, when private citizens gain unauthorized access to Treasury payment systems, when civil servants are punished for having participated in legally required training—these aren’t isolated incidents or normal policy changes. They represent the coordinated dismantling of constitutional governance and its replacement with a system of personal loyalty.</p>
<p>The machinery of government—the actual systems and institutions through which public authority flows—is being captured by private interests operating outside constitutional constraints. This is precisely what the Civil Service Reform Act was designed to prevent. These aren’t abstract concerns about democratic norms—these are concrete violations of specific laws designed to prevent exactly this kind of authoritarian capture of government functions.</p>
<p>This is an emergency, and it demands emergency response from every American with power or influence. The window for effective resistance narrows with each passing day. History will judge harshly those who had the capacity to resist but chose instead to wait and see how things develop. The time to act is now, before the mechanisms that would allow effective resistance are completely dismantled.</p>
<p>The American Constitution represents more than just a system of government—it embodies humanity’s greatest experiment in self-governance through reason and law rather than force and will. When the Founders established our constitutional republic, they created something unprecedented: a government bound by law rather than personal authority, where power flows through democratic institutions rather than individual whim. This inheritance, paid for with the blood of patriots from Lexington to Normandy, gave birth to the very idea of modern liberal democracy.</p>
<p>Now we watch as this precious inheritance is being systematically subjugated to the personal authority of Donald Trump and Elon Musk. The constitutional firebreaks designed to prevent the concentration of power—checks and balances, civil service protections, congressional oversight—are being dismantled not through revolution but through a calculated strategy of institutional capture. When private citizens gain control of Treasury systems, when security officials are removed for following classification protocols, when Congress abandons its constitutional duties, we’re witnessing the subordination of constitutional governance to personal power.</p>
<p>This isn’t just another political crisis—it’s an existential threat to the constitutional order that has secured human liberty for over two centuries. Every American who understands the value of this inheritance has a duty to resist its destruction. The Constitution doesn’t defend itself—it requires citizens willing to stand for the principles of democratic governance against those who would replace the rule of law with the rule of men.</p>
<p>There is a fundamental difference between partisan policy debates and what we’re witnessing now. When Republicans pass legislation on immigration, when they reform tax policy, when they push back against progressive cultural initiatives—this is the normal, healthy function of democratic governance. Elections have consequences, and the party in power has every right to advance its policy agenda through legal channels.</p>
<p>But what’s happening now exists in a different category entirely. When private citizens gain unauthorized access to Treasury payment systems, when security officials are removed for following classification protocols, when congressionally established agencies are illegally shuttered—these aren’t policy changes. They represent the systematic dismantling of the constitutional framework that makes policy debates possible in the first place.</p>
<p>Consider the profound difference: Opposing Democratic policies on taxation or immigration is legitimate political disagreement. Refusing to execute laws passed by Congress, removing civil servants for following legal requirements, and allowing private citizens to seize control of government functions represents an attack on constitutional governance itself. The former is about what policies we should have; the latter is about whether we’ll maintain a system where policy debates matter at all.</p>
<p>To conservatives who value our constitutional inheritance: This isn’t about advancing Republican policies or opposing Democratic ones. It’s about whether we’ll preserve the constitutional system that allows these debates to occur through democratic processes rather than personal decree. When we replace professional civil service with personal loyalty systems, when we ignore congressional mandates, when we allow private interests to seize control of government functions—we’re not winning political battles, we’re destroying the arena where those battles are meant to occur.</p>
<p>The voices of history echo through our present crisis with devastating clarity. Each American who gave their life to preserve constitutional democracy—from the blood-soaked fields of Gettysburg to the beaches of Normandy—did so with the faith that future generations would guard the precious gift of self-governance. They died not just to defeat specific enemies, but to ensure that government of the people, by the people, for the people would not perish from the earth.</p>
<p>Now, as we watch the systematic dismantling of constitutional governance—as private citizens seize control of government functions, as career civil servants are purged for following the law, as Congress abandons its duties—these sacrifices demand action from every American who understands what’s at stake. The transformation happening before our eyes—from a government bound by law to one bound by personal loyalty—is precisely what generations of Americans gave their lives to prevent.</p>
<p>This isn’t about partisan politics or policy preferences. This is about preserving the constitutional inheritance that makes American democracy possible at all. When we see security officials removed for protecting classified information, when we watch congressionally established agencies illegally shuttered, when we witness the machinery of government being captured by private interests—we’re seeing the unraveling of everything our fallen heroes died to protect.</p>
<p>The dead speak to us now with urgent clarity: The time for comfortable illusions has passed. Every American who values constitutional democracy must act to preserve it. Not tomorrow, not after the next election, but now—while the mechanisms for democratic resistance still exist. Our ancestors paid for our freedom with their blood. We dishonor their sacrifice if we surrender it through inaction.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-td-block-uid="tdi_70">
<p>Bitcoin was never used by most Salvadorans, its modern city was never built, and now it will cease to be legal tender in El Salvador, the first country in the world to adopt it in 2021: a complete failed economic bet by President Nayib Bukele. Congress, dominated by the ruling party, approved last Wednesday a confusing reform to the Bitcoin Law at the request of Bukele’s government, which had no other option to receive the $1.4 billion credit agreed in December with the International Monetary Fund (<a href="https://www.imf.org/en/home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IMF</a>).</p>



<p>The reform eliminated the word “currency” when referring to bitcoin, but says it is “<a href="https://ticotimes.net/2021/09/07/in-world-first-bitcoin-becomes-legal-tender-in-el-salvador" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">legal tender</a>.” Despite the lack of clarity, it lifts, as required by the IMF, the obligation to accept it in transactions or debt payments, a key condition for it to be “legal tender,” according to economic analysts. With the change, “if someone owes you money and wants to pay you in bitcoin, you can refuse to be paid in bitcoin, but you cannot refuse if it’s legal tender,” economist Carlos Acevedo explained.</p>



<p>The use of bitcoin in El Salvador’s dollarized economy, according to the new rule, will be optional and will be at the discretion of the private sector to accept cryptocurrency payments for goods and services. Businesses are no longer required to convert dollar prices into this cryptocurrency. “Bitcoin no longer has that force of legal tender. That’s how it should have always remained, but the government wanted to force it and it didn’t work,” economist Rafael Lemus said.</p>



<h2 id="h-very-complicated-and-risky"><strong>Very Complicated and Risky</strong></h2>



<p>The Bitcoin Law reform will take effect 90 days after it’s published in the Official Gazette, which could happen in the coming days. For Acevedo, former president of the former Central Bank, “it makes no sense” to have left in the reformed law that it is “legal tender.” “It’s a monstrosity that’s not understood and that should be corrected and made clear that bitcoin is no longer legal tender,” the economist argues.</p>



<p>But even being so, Salvadorans, with the exception of a few, never embraced Bukele’s initiative, who enjoys enormous popularity for his war against gangs, which dropped homicides to historic lows in El Salvador. A recent survey by the Central American University (UCA) revealed that 92% of Salvadorans did not use bitcoin in their transactions in 2024.</p>



<p>“I used it and didn’t like it… Very complicated and risky. This is not for an employee who barely gets by on their salary,” Juana Henríquez, a 55-year-old nurse, said, saying she had tried to make some profit and instead lost money. Bukele also failed to achieve his project, which he announced with fireworks, to create Bitcoin City, a high-tech city that would be the capital of bitcoiners in the country and would take energy for mining from a volcano in Conchagua, about 200 km from Salvador.</p>



<p>Berlin, a city 110 km east of San Salvador, and <a href="https://ticotimes.net/2025/01/31/trump-effect-drives-bitcoin-growth-in-small-el-salvador-town">El Zont</a><a href="https://ticotimes.net/2025/01/31/trump-effect-drives-bitcoin-growth-in-small-el-salvador-town" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">e beach</a> (southwest) are two areas that concentrate bitcoiners, but many are foreign residents or tourists.</p>



<h2 id="h-government-reserves"><strong>Government Reserves</strong></h2>



<p>Bitcoin’s biggest promoter in the country, Bukele, has not yet referred to the legal reform. But officials ensure that the government will continue betting on this cryptocurrency, whose price currently exceeds $100,000. El Salvador’s ambassador to the United States, Milena Mayorga, told journalists Thursday, during a bitcoin event in San Salvador, that the law reforms should be seen as an adaptation “to the circumstances.”</p>



<p>The government, she assured, will continue buying bitcoin and having reserves in this cryptocurrency. According to the National Bitcoin Office, El Salvador has 6,050 bitcoins worth $634.8 million. “President Bukele continues buying bitcoin, we have a Bitcoin Office, we have the Bitcoin Law, bitcoin can be used in El Salvador. It hasn’t been an easy road,” Mayorga summarized.</p>



<p>For Lemus, because “the government has its bitcoin reserve and will buy more” it is necessary “to have transparency, for citizens to know how public funds are being invested.” Bukele recently said he is convinced that with Donald Trump – whom he supports – in the White House there will be “an exponential revaluation” of the cryptocurrency. He frequently posts price increases on his social networks. For now, he remains silent.</p>

<p>The Republican Senator from Missouri Josh Hawley has introduced a new bill that would make it illegal to import or export artificial intelligence products to and from China, meaning someone who knowingly downloads a Chinese developed AI model like the now immensely popular DeepSeek could face up to 20 years in jail, a million dollar fine, or both, should such a law pass.</p><p>Kevin Bankston, a senior advisor on AI governance at the Center for Democracy &amp; Technology, told 404 Media it is “a broad attack on the very idea of scientific dialogue and technology exchange with China around AI, with potentially ruinous penalties for AI researchers and users alike and deeply troubling implications for the future of online speech and freedom of scientific inquiry.”</p><p>Hawley <a href="https://www.hawley.senate.gov/hawley-introduces-legislation-to-decouple-american-ai-development-from-communist-china/?ref=404media.co"><u>introduced the legislation</u></a>, titled the Decoupling America’s Artificial Intelligence Capabilities from China Act, on Wednesday of last year.&nbsp;</p><p>“Every dollar and gig of data that flows into Chinese AI are dollars and data that will ultimately be used against the United States,” Senator Hawley said in a statement. “America cannot afford to empower our greatest adversary at the expense of our own strength. Ensuring American economic superiority means cutting China off from American ingenuity and halting the subsidization of CCP innovation.”</p><p>Hawley’s statement explicitly says that he introduced the legislation because of the release of DeepSeek, an advanced AI model that’s competitive with its American counterparts, and which its developers claimed was made for a fraction of the cost and without access to as many and as advanced of chips, though these claims are unverified. Hawley’s statement called DeepSeek “a data-harvesting, low-cost AI model that <a href="https://outreach.senate.gov/iqextranet/iqClickTrk.aspx?cid=SenHawley&amp;crop=14331QQQ9477525QQQ8249110QQQ8019990&amp;report_id=&amp;redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxnews.com%2Fpolitics%2Fdeepseek-fallout-gop-sen-josh-hawley-seeks-cut-off-all-us-china-collaboration-ai-development%3Fintcmp%3Dtw_fnc&amp;redir_log=286219651778979&amp;ref=404media.co"><u>sparked</u></a> international concern and sent American technology stocks plummeting.”&nbsp;</p><p>Hawley’s statement says the goal of the bill is to “prohibit the import from or export to China of artificial intelligence technology, “prohibit American companies from conducting AI research in China or in cooperation with Chinese companies,” and “Prohibit U.S. companies from investing money in Chinese AI development.”</p><p>Hawley’s bill and its aims were covered credulously on <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/deepseek-fallout-gop-sen-josh-hawley-seeks-cut-off-all-us-china-collaboration-ai-development?ref=404media.co"><u>Fox News</u></a>, but even if you think the bill’s goals are worth pursuing the actual <a href="https://www.hawley.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Hawley-Decoupling-Americas-Artificial-Intelligence-Capabilities-from-China-Act.pdf?ref=404media.co"><u>language of the bill</u></a> is broad and dystopian. Unlike legislators who fearmongered about TikTok and wanted to ban it, Hawley’s bill would criminalize the activity of average users, millions of whom downloaded DeepSeek recently, making it one of the most popular apps on the Apple App store.&nbsp;</p><p>Specifically, the bill prohibits “the importation into the United States of artificial intelligence or generative artificial intelligence technology or intellectual proprietary developed or produced in the People’s Republic of China.” Those who violate this&nbsp; “Shall be subject to the criminal penalties set forth in subsection (b) of section 1760 of the Export Control Reform Act of 2018 (50 U. S.C, 4819).”&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid%3AUSC-prelim-title50-section4819&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim&amp;ref=404media.co"><u>That law states that</u></a> “A person who willfully commits, willfully attempts to commit, or willfully conspires to commit, or aids and abets in the commission of, an unlawful act described in subsection (a) (1) shall be fined not more than $1,000,000; and (2) in the case of the individual, shall be imprisoned for not more than 20 years, or both.”</p><p>the Center for Democracy &amp; Technology’s Bankston told me that he’s skeptical that there would be strong criminal cases against someone who unintentionally downloaded an app like DeepSeek because the legislation specifies a person’s conduct must be “willful” for the imposition of criminal penalties, the bill is still “worrisomely broad.”&nbsp;</p><p>“It appears that it *could* apply to someone who downloaded DeepSeek knowing that it was from China, and yes, the criminal penalty for that under this proposal would be up to one million dollars or 20 years in prison (and also potentially civil penalties as well, which may require less proof of state of mind and may potentially even reach a mere accidental ‘importer’ of a Chinese model),” Bankston said.</p><p>The bill, which also prohibits the “transfer of research,” could create an unworkable environment for computer scientists who make their research public, and regularly read AI papers published by Chinese researchers.&nbsp;</p><p>“Beyond just impacting people downloading models from China, the bill's penalties for the import to or export from China of AI technology and intellectual property could also potentially extend to anyone who publishes AI models or research papers on the open internet knowing they will be downloaded by people in China,” Bankston said. “Researchers are also threatened by the second half of the bill, which would directly outlaw American collaboration with researchers at basically any Chinese university or company—with a fine of up to 100 million dollars for any company that violates the prohibition, amongst other penalties.”</p><p>"The bill threatens the development and publishing of AI advancements in the United States, and we're particularly worried about the impact on open and collaborative development of these technologies outside the proprietary systems of the Big Tech incumbents," Kit Walsh, the Electronic Frontier Foundation's Director of AI and Access-to-Knowledge Legal Projects, told me. "In the past, the government has argued that merely publishing information on the internet counts as an export, and interpreting this law in such a way would further solidify the dominance of proprietary AI over open or academic research. The law would also interfere with efforts at AI accountability, such as transparency requirements that states and members of Congress have sought to create in order to make sure that AI isn't harming people in the United States when used for decisions about such wide-ranging things as housing, health care, and hiring."</p><p>On its face, the bill seems mostly like hawkish posturing from Hawley, and the language of the bill seems unworkable given the current state of computer science, the AI industry, and the culture of researchers sharing their work. However, there is bipartisan support for legislation that targets China wherever it appears able to topple American dominance. Banning TikTok also seemed like a ludicrous notion at first given its popularity among Americans, and while the app is still live, a bill banning it did pass both the house and the Senate and was signed by the president.&nbsp;</p><p>Hawley’s office did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p><em>Update: This article has been updates with comment from the EFF.</em></p>
