<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post"><article><p>2025-08-04</p><section><p>5 min read</p><img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5MASs8Vb8NUgKEKxHQEBiz/a6983d0188bf0279b82af7134905da6c/image6.png" alt=""><div><p>We are observing stealth crawling behavior from Perplexity, an AI-powered answer engine. Although Perplexity initially crawls from their declared user agent, when they are presented with a network block, they appear to obscure their crawling identity in an attempt to circumvent the website’s preferences. We see continued evidence that Perplexity is repeatedly modifying their user agent and changing their source <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-an-autonomous-system/"><u>ASNs</u></a> to hide their crawling activity, as well as ignoring — or sometimes failing to even fetch — <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/bots/what-is-robots-txt/"><u>robots.txt</u> </a>files.</p><p>The Internet as we have known it for the past three decades is <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content-independence-day-no-ai-crawl-without-compensation/"><u>rapidly changing</u></a>, but one thing remains constant: it is built on trust. There are clear preferences that crawlers should be transparent, serve a clear purpose, perform a specific activity, and, most importantly, follow website directives and preferences. Based on Perplexity’s observed behavior, which is incompatible with those preferences, we have de-listed them as a verified bot and added heuristics to our managed rules that block this stealth crawling.</p>
    <p>
      <h3 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h3>
      
    </p>
    <p>We received complaints from customers who had both disallowed Perplexity crawling activity in their <code>robots.txt</code> files and also created WAF rules to specifically block both of Perplexity’s <a href="https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/bots"><u>declared crawlers</u></a>: <code>PerplexityBot</code> and <code>Perplexity-User</code>. These customers told us that Perplexity was still able to access their content even when they saw its bots successfully blocked. We confirmed that Perplexity’s crawlers were in fact being blocked on the specific pages in question, and then performed several targeted tests to confirm what exact behavior we could observe.</p><p>We created multiple brand-new domains, similar to <code>testexample.com</code> and <code>secretexample.com</code>. These domains were newly purchased and had not yet been indexed by any search engine nor made publicly accessible in any discoverable way. We implemented a <code>robots.txt</code> file with directives to stop any respectful bots from accessing any part of a website: &nbsp;</p>

          </figure><p>We conducted an experiment by querying Perplexity AI with questions about these domains, and discovered Perplexity was still providing detailed information regarding the exact content hosted on each of these restricted domains. This response was unexpected, as we had taken all necessary precautions to prevent this data from being retrievable by their <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/bots/what-is-a-web-crawler/"><u>crawlers</u></a>.</p>

    </p>
    <p><b>Bypassing Robots.txt and undisclosed IPs/User Agents</b></p><p>Our multiple test domains explicitly prohibited all automated access by specifying in robots.txt and had specific WAF rules that blocked crawling from <a href="https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/bots"><u>Perplexity’s public crawlers</u></a>.&nbsp;We observed that Perplexity uses not only their declared user-agent, but also a generic browser intended to impersonate Google Chrome on macOS when their declared crawler was blocked. </p><table><tbody><tr><td><p>Declared</p></td><td><p>Mozilla/5.0 AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko; compatible; Perplexity-User/1.0; +https://perplexity.ai/perplexity-user)</p></td><td><p>20-25m daily requests</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Stealth</p></td><td><p>Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/124.0.0.0 Safari/537.36</p></td><td><p>3-6m daily requests</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Both their declared and undeclared crawlers were attempting to access the content for scraping contrary to the web crawling norms as outlined in RFC <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9309"><u>9309</u></a>.</p><p>This undeclared crawler utilized multiple IPs not listed in <a href="https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/bots"><u>Perplexity’s official IP range</u></a>, and would rotate through these IPs in response to the restrictive robots.txt policy and block from Cloudflare. In addition to rotating IPs, we observed requests coming from different ASNs in attempts to further evade website blocks. This activity was observed across tens of thousands of domains and millions of requests per day. We were able to fingerprint this crawler using a combination of machine learning and network signals.</p><p>An example:&nbsp;</p>

          </figure><p>Of note: when the stealth crawler was successfully blocked, we observed that Perplexity uses other data sources — including other websites — to try to create an answer. However, these answers were less specific and lacked details from the original content, reflecting the fact that the block had been successful.&nbsp;</p>

      <h2 id="how-well-meaning-bot-operators-respect-website-preferences">How well-meaning bot operators respect website preferences</h2>
      
    </p>
    <p>In contrast to the behavior described above, the Internet has expressed clear preferences on how good crawlers should behave. All well-intentioned crawlers acting in good faith should:</p><p><b>Be transparent</b>. Identify themselves honestly, using a unique user-agent, a declared list of IP ranges or <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/concepts/bot/verified-bots/web-bot-auth/"><u>Web Bot Auth</u></a> integration, and provide contact information if something goes wrong.</p><p><b>Be well-behaved netizens</b>. Don’t flood sites with excessive traffic, <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/bots/what-is-data-scraping/"><u>scrape</u></a> sensitive data, or use stealth tactics to try and dodge detection.</p><p><b>Serve a clear purpose</b>. Whether it’s powering a voice assistant, checking product prices, or making a website more accessible, every bot has a reason to be there. The purpose should be clearly and precisely defined and easy for site owners to look up publicly.</p><p><b>Separate bots for separate activities</b>. Perform each activity from a unique bot. This makes it easy for site owners to decide which activities they want to allow. Don’t force site owners to make an all-or-nothing decision. </p><p><b>Follow the rules</b>. That means checking for and respecting website signals like <code>robots.txt</code>, staying within rate limits, and never bypassing security protections.</p><p>More details are outlined in our official <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/concepts/bot/verified-bots/policy/"><u>Verified Bots Policy Developer Docs</u></a>.</p><p>OpenAI is an example of a leading AI company that follows these best practices. They clearly <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/bots"><u>outline their crawlers</u> and </a>give detailed explanations for each crawler’s purpose. They respect robots.txt and do not try to evade either a robots.txt directive or a network level block. And <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-agent/"><u>ChatGPT Agent</u></a> is signing http requests using the newly proposed open standard <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/concepts/bot/verified-bots/web-bot-auth/"><u>Web Bot Auth</u></a>.</p><p>When we ran the same test as outlined above with ChatGPT, we found that ChatGPT-User fetched the robots file and stopped crawling when it was disallowed. We did not observe follow-up crawls from any other user agents or third party bots. When we removed the disallow directive from the robots entry, but presented ChatGPT with a block page, they again stopped crawling, and we saw no additional crawl attempts from other user agents. Both of these demonstrate the appropriate response to website owner preferences.</p>

      <h2 id="how-can-you-protect-yourself">How can you protect yourself?</h2>
      
    </p>
    <p>All the undeclared crawling activity that we observed from Perplexity’s hidden User Agent was scored by our bot management system as a bot and was unable to pass managed challenges. Any bot management customer who has an existing block rule in place is already protected. Customers who don’t want to block traffic can set up rules to <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/custom-rules/use-cases/challenge-bad-bots/"><u>challenge requests</u></a>, giving real humans an opportunity to proceed. Customers with existing challenge rules are already protected. Lastly, we added signature matches for the stealth crawler into our <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/concepts/bot/#ai-bots"><u>managed rule</u></a> that <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/additional-configurations/block-ai-bots/"><u>blocks AI crawling activity</u></a>. This rule is available to all customers, including our free customers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
      <h2 id="whats-next">What’s next?</h2>
      
    </p>
    <p>We announced <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content-independence-day-no-ai-crawl-without-compensation/"><u>Content Independence Day</u></a> almost one month ago, giving content creators and publishers more control over how their content is accessed. Today, over two and a half million websites have chosen to completely disallow AI training through our managed robots.txt feature or our <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/concepts/bot/#ai-bots"><u>managed rule blocking AI Crawlers</u></a>. Every Cloudflare customer is now able to selectively decide which declared AI crawlers are able to access their content in accordance with their business objectives.</p><p>We expected a change in bot and crawler behavior based on these new features, and we expect that the techniques bot operators use to evade detection will continue to evolve. Once this post is live the behavior we saw will almost certainly change, and the methods we use to stop them will keep evolving as well.&nbsp;</p><p>Cloudflare is actively working with technical and policy experts around the world, like the IETF efforts to standardize <a href="https://ietf-wg-aipref.github.io/drafts/draft-ietf-aipref-vocab.html?cf_target_id=_blank"><u>extensions to robots.txt</u></a>, to establish clear and measurable principles that well-meaning bot operators should abide by. We think this is an important next step in this quickly evolving space.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-testid="ArticlePageChunks"><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p><span>President Donald Trump’s</span> administration has dramatically expanded its work with Palantir, elevating the company cofounded by Trump ally Peter Thiel as the government’s go-to software developer. Following massive contract terminations for consulting giants and government contractors like Accenture, Booz Allen, and Deloitte, Palantir has emerged ahead. Now the data analytics firm is partnering with those companies—offering them a lifeline while consolidating its own power.</p><p>Palantir has become one of the few winners in the Trump administration’s cost-cutting efforts, <a data-offer-url="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/30/technology/trump-palantir-data-americans.html" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/30/technology/trump-palantir-data-americans.html&quot;}" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/30/technology/trump-palantir-data-americans.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">receiving more than $113 million</a> in federal spending since the beginning of the year, according to The New York Times. Palantir’s US government revenue has grown by more than $ 370 million compared to this time last year, according to the company’s <a data-offer-url="https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2025/Palantir-Reports-Q1-2025-Revenue-Growth-of-39-YY-U-S--Revenue-Growth-of-55-YY-Raises-FY-2025-Revenue-Guidance-to-36-YY-Growth-and-U-S--Comm-Revenue-Guidance-to-68-YY-Crushing-Consensus-Expectations/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2025/Palantir-Reports-Q1-2025-Revenue-Growth-of-39-YY-U-S--Revenue-Growth-of-55-YY-Raises-FY-2025-Revenue-Guidance-to-36-YY-Growth-and-U-S--Comm-Revenue-Guidance-to-68-YY-Crushing-Consensus-Expectations/&quot;}" href="https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2025/Palantir-Reports-Q1-2025-Revenue-Growth-of-39-YY-U-S--Revenue-Growth-of-55-YY-Raises-FY-2025-Revenue-Guidance-to-36-YY-Growth-and-U-S--Comm-Revenue-Guidance-to-68-YY-Crushing-Consensus-Expectations/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">most recent quarterly earnings report</a>. Before making remarks at last week’s AI Summit in DC, Trump thanked a variety of cabinet secretaries and tech leaders, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/tBNX9x5GgPE?feature=shared&amp;t=922">including Palantir chief technology officer Shyam Sankar</a>. “We buy a lot of things from Palantir,” Trump said. “Are we paying our bills? I think so.”</p><p>Instead of replacing these more traditional contractors, Palantir’s software is becoming the core tool deployed by them in government systems, placing Palantir in a newly central role.</p><p>The White House itself is thrilled by this partnership: “The Trump Administration has high-standard [sic] when spending American’s hard-earned tax dollars—which is why agencies have partnered with Palantir, a top-tier American company renowned for their longstanding history of innovation, results, and increasing government efficiency,” says White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers.</p><p>Palantir did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p><p>In April, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/palantir-doge-irs-mega-api-data/">WIRED reported that Palantir was working alongside IRS engineers</a> to build what sources called a “mega API,” which would unify all data across the agency. An API, or application programming interface, enables applications and databases to exchange data and possibly compare it against other interoperable datasets. Once completed, this mega API could become the “read center of all IRS systems.” Immigration and Customs Enforcement <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ice-palantir-immigrationos/">contracted Palantir for $30 million</a> to track self-deportations in April. The company has also won federal contracts more recently, like a $795 million award from the Pentagon in May to expand its Maven Smart System program. The total contract ceiling for the Army’s Maven program is now $1.3 billion.</p><p>This growth comes as some of the companies Palantir has chosen to partner with have lost billions in government contract cuts. In April, defense secretary Pete Hegseth announced plans to cut $5.1 billion in IT consulting contracts with companies including Accenture, Booz Allen, and Deloitte. <a href="https://media.defense.gov/2025/Apr/10/2003687449/-1/-1/1/SECRETARY-OF-DEFENSE-PETE-HEGSETH-UPDATE-ON-CONTINUING-ELIMINATION-OF-WASTEFUL-SPENDING-AT-THE-DOD.PDF">In a memo announcing the cuts</a>, Hegseth said that the Pentagon would be forced to bring more of its IT work in-house.</p><p>“These contracts represent non-essential spending on third party consultants to perform services more efficiently performed by the highly skilled members of our DoD workforce using existing resources,” Hegseth wrote.</p><p>Palantir’s partnerships with these companies vary, but each one makes it easier for Palantir to extend the reach of its software and AI technology across the federal government. With Accenture’s government branch, Palantir will train and certify at least 1,000 Accenture workers on its Foundry software as well as its AI tech, <a data-offer-url="https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/2025/palantir-and-accenture-federal-services-join-forces-to-help-federal-government-agencies-reinvent-operations-with-ai" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/2025/palantir-and-accenture-federal-services-join-forces-to-help-federal-government-agencies-reinvent-operations-with-ai&quot;}" href="https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/2025/palantir-and-accenture-federal-services-join-forces-to-help-federal-government-agencies-reinvent-operations-with-ai" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">according to an Accenture press release</a> The companies also said that together they could create “a 360-degree view” of government agency budgets, something the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has sought to build and use to review federal spending. (Palantir <a data-offer-url="https://t.co/5mcFHsKEje" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://t.co/5mcFHsKEje&quot;}" href="https://t.co/5mcFHsKEje" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">partnered with Accenture before in 2022</a>, but this is the first partnership to focus on US government clients.)</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>“We are teaming up with Accenture Federal Services to accelerate AI across the U.S. Government, working to address federal agencies’ highest-priority operational challenges,” Palantir posted to X last month.</p><p>"What makes this partnership so uniquely powerful is Accenture’s expertise working with the federal government and our ability to bring commercial capabilities to government solutions, combined with Palantir’s deep experience in government software," Julie Sweet, chair and CEO of Accenture, said in a press release. “Together, we will harness the ever-growing power of AI to help the federal government succeed in its critical mission to modernize and reinvent its operations—with stronger data flows, transparency and resilience—to better serve warfighters, citizens and all its stakeholders.”</p><p>Accenture did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>While Palantir has become a major government contractor in its own right, partnering with contracting giants could enable the software company to scale at a much faster rate, leveraging long-standing relationships these larger contractors have with virtually every federal agency. “It's actually a pretty savvy business decision on the part of both Palantir, then also what you would call a traditional, more legacy-oriented, like defense or just government contractors,” says Jessica Tillipman, associate dean for government procurement law at George Washington University. “If they’re newer to certain areas and others have that footprint, that’s how it would benefit Palantir.”</p><p>Last week, Palantir and Deloitte announced a partnership that includes what they call the “Enterprise Operating System” (EOS) to unify data across organizations. At government agencies like the Internal Revenue Service and reportedly at the Social Security Administration (SSA), Palantir is already working to combine agency datasets, allowing what were previously disparate datasets to communicate with one another more easily.</p><p>"Deloitte shares Palantir's commitment to decisive action and a dedication to delivering meaningful, lasting results for commercial and government clients," said Jason Girzadas, Deloitte US CEO, said in a press release announcing the partnership. "Expanding our preferred relationship at this pivotal moment provides our clients with Palantir's latest advances in AI, combined with Deloitte's engineering scale and deep sector experience."</p><p>Deloitte did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Palantir struck some of these deals prior to Trump taking office as well.

<p>Two weeks after Valve confirmed it had <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/software/platforms/valve-confirms-credit-card-companies-pressured-it-to-delist-certain-adult-games-from-steam/" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.pcgamer.com/software/platforms/valve-confirms-credit-card-companies-pressured-it-to-delist-certain-adult-games-from-steam/">removed a pile of NSFW games from Steam</a> because of pressure from credit card companies—and one week after <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/itch-io-latest-in-platforms-pressured-by-credit-card-companies-as-well-as-activist-group-collective-shout-which-has-successfully-caught-an-award-winning-indie-and-more-in-the-crossfire/" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/itch-io-latest-in-platforms-pressured-by-credit-card-companies-as-well-as-activist-group-collective-shout-which-has-successfully-caught-an-award-winning-indie-and-more-in-the-crossfire/">Itch.io followed suit</a>—Mastercard has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mastercard.com/us/en/news-and-trends/press/2025/august/clarifying-recent-headlines-on-gaming-content.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.mastercard.com/us/en/news-and-trends/press/2025/august/clarifying-recent-headlines-on-gaming-content.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">released a statement</a> denying responsibility for the takedowns, saying it "allows all lawful purchases" to be processed through its systems.</p><p>"Mastercard has not evaluated any game or required restrictions of any activity on game creator sites and platforms, contrary to media reports and allegations," the company says<em>.</em></p><p>"Our payment network follows standards based on the rule of law. Put simply, we allow all lawful purchases on our network. At the same time, we require merchants to have appropriate controls to ensure Mastercard cards cannot be used for unlawful purchases, including illegal adult content."</p><p>It's an odd statement at first glance, because while the content removed by Steam and Itch.io may violate laws in some countries, it's fully legal in the US—objectionable and gross as hell in some cases, sure, but still within the boundaries of the law. Apart from that, both Valve and Itch.io explicitly stated that payment processors are the reason games were deindexed or removed from sale entirely.</p><p>Mastercard's 'out' here seems to be found in the structure of its operations. The company's website says it is "neither an issuer [a merchant bank] nor an acquirer [a bank, credit union, or other entity that provides debit cards or lines of credit to consumers]," but rather that it "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://sea.mastercard.com/en-region-sea/business/merchants/start-accepting/payment-process.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://sea.mastercard.com/en-region-sea/business/merchants/start-accepting/payment-process.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">provide[s] the technology and the network that power transactions</a>." In other words, Mastercard does not process payments, it facilitates the systems that do.</p><p>In the case of Itch.io, the platform specifies in its "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://itch.io/updates/update-on-nsfw-content" target="_blank" data-url="https://itch.io/updates/update-on-nsfw-content" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">update on NSFW content</a>" that its payment processors are Paypal and Stripe—and Stripe, which supports a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://stripe.com/ae/payments/payment-methods" target="_blank" data-url="https://stripe.com/ae/payments/payment-methods" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">range of payment methods</a> including Visa and Mastercards, was the one <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="http://itch.io/" target="_blank" data-url="http://itch.io" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">Itch.io</a> "suspended the ability to pay with for 18+ content for the foreseeable future."</p><p>Similarly, both <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.verotel.com/en/index.html?lang=en" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.verotel.com/en/index.html?lang=en" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">Verotel</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ccbill.com/" target="_blank" data-url="https://ccbill.com/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">CCBill</a>, which were recently recommended by the IGDA as "alternatives to overly risk-averse financial partners," accept major credit cards as payment methods.</p><div data-hydrate="true" id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-tMB45j7AvDWp2uiMV2GJFb"><section><p>Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.</p></section></div><p>In a statement provided to PC Gamer, Valve said that it had tried to work things out with Mastercard directly prior to removing the games, and suggested that Mastercard did have at least an indirect influence on the outcome.</p><p>"Mastercard did not communicate with Valve directly, despite our request to do so," a Valve representative said. "Mastercard communicated with payment processors and their acquiring banks. Payment processors communicated this with Valve, and we replied by outlining Steam’s policy since 2018 of attempting to distribute games that are legal for distribution.</p><p>"Payment processors rejected this, and specifically cited Mastercard’s Rule 5.12.7 and risk to the Mastercard brand."</p><figure><blockquote><p>"Mastercard did not communicate with Valve directly, despite our request to do so."</p><figcaption><cite>Valve representative</cite></figcaption></blockquote></figure><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mastercard.us/content/dam/public/mastercardcom/na/global-site/documents/mastercard-rules.pdf" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.mastercard.us/content/dam/public/mastercardcom/na/global-site/documents/mastercard-rules.pdf" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">Mastercard's Rule 5.12.7</a> relates to "illegal or brand-damaging transactions," and states:</p><p><em>A Merchant must not submit to its Acquirer, and a Customer must not submit to the Interchange System, any Transaction that is illegal, or in the sole discretion of the Corporation, may damage the goodwill of the Corporation or reflect negatively on the Marks.</em></p><p>That includes, according to the rules, any product or services that "is patently offensive and lacks serious artistic value (such as, by way of example and not limitation, images of nonconsensual sexual behavior, sexual exploitation of a minor, nonconsensual mutilation of a person or body part, and bestiality), or any other material that the Corporation deems unacceptable to sell in connection with a Mark."</p><p>Acquirers—the financial institutions that provide the cards and lines of credit—who fail to take action in response to complaints are subject to significant penalties, monetary and otherwise.</p><p>Regardless of the role Mastercard played in all of this, directly or indirectly, its "clarification" sure makes it seem like the pressure is being felt. Which from a gamer perspective, at least, is a good thing: As others have mentioned, a public pressure campaign certainly seemed to work for Collective Shout, the Australian anti-porn crusaders who <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/australian-anti-porn-group-claims-responsibility-for-steams-new-censorship-rules-in-victory-against-porn-sick-brain-rotted-pedo-gamer-fetishists-and-things-only-get-weirder-from-there/" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/australian-anti-porn-group-claims-responsibility-for-steams-new-censorship-rules-in-victory-against-porn-sick-brain-rotted-pedo-gamer-fetishists-and-things-only-get-weirder-from-there/">started this whole thing</a>—regardless of how the gears turn behind the curtain, there's no reason to think it can't work the other way too.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>The next time you get buttoned-up and sit down for a long-awaited job interview, you might not find a human on the other end of the call. Instead, job-hunters are now joining <a href="https://fortune.com/company/zoom/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/zoom/">Zoom</a> meetings only to <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@leohumpsalot/video/7501016832850103583" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Go to https://www.tiktok.com/@leohumpsalot/video/7501016832850103583">be greeted by</a> AI interviewers. Candidates tell <em>Fortune </em>they’re either confused, intrigued, or straight-up dejected when the robotic, faceless bots join the calls.&nbsp;</p><div>



<p>“Looking for a job right now is so demoralizing and soul-sucking, that to submit yourself to that added indignity is just a step too far,” Debra Borchardt, a seasoned writer and editor who has been on the job-hunt for three months, tells <em>Fortune. </em>“Within minutes, I was like, ‘I don’t like this. This is awful.’ It started out normal…Then it went into the actual process of the interview, and that’s when it got a little weird.”



</p><p>AI interviewers are only the newest <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/09/05/ai-changing-job-hunting-recruiting/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/09/05/ai-changing-job-hunting-recruiting/">change to the</a> hiring process that has <a href="https://fortune.com/2025/06/11/ai-hiring-process-employee-skills-candidate/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2025/06/11/ai-hiring-process-employee-skills-candidate/">been upended</a> by the advanced technology. With HR teams dwindling and hiring managers tasked to review <a href="https://fortune.com/2025/05/25/insurance-giant-progressive-is-hiring-12000-workers-this-year-and-its-using-ai-to-parse-through-hundreds-of-thousands-of-applications/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2025/05/25/insurance-giant-progressive-is-hiring-12000-workers-this-year-and-its-using-ai-to-parse-through-hundreds-of-thousands-of-applications/">thousands of</a> applicants for a single role, they’re <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/09/24/two-page-resume-new-normal-ai-job-seekers/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/09/24/two-page-resume-new-normal-ai-job-seekers/">optimizing their</a> jobs <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/09/04/how-ai-changing-future-recruiting-job-search/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/09/04/how-ai-changing-future-recruiting-job-search/">by using AI to</a> filter top applicants, schedule candidate interviews, and automate correspondence about next steps in the process. AI interviewers may be a god-send for middle-managers, but job-seekers see them as only another hurdle in the <a href="https://fortune.com/2025/07/14/gen-z-job-hunting-harder-millions-unemployed-millennial-gen-x-careers-ai-entry-level-work/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2025/07/14/gen-z-job-hunting-harder-millions-unemployed-millennial-gen-x-careers-ai-entry-level-work/">intense hunt for</a> work.&nbsp;



</p><p>The experience for some job-hunters has been so poor that they’re swearing off interviews conducted by AI altogether. Candidates tell <em>Fortune </em>that AI interviewers make them feel unappreciated to the point where they’d rather skip out on potential job opportunities, reasoning the company’s culture can’t be great if human bosses won’t make the time to interview them. But HR experts argue the opposite; since AI interviewers can help hiring managers save time in first-round calls, the humans have more time to have more meaningful conversations with applicants down the line.&nbsp;



</p><p>Job-seekers and HR are starkly divided on how they feel about the tech, but one thing is fact—AI interviewers aren’t going anywhere.&nbsp;</p><p>“The truth is, if you want a job, you’re gonna go through this thing,” Adam Jackson, CEO and founder of Braintrust, a company that distributes AI interviewers, tells <em>Fortune. </em>“If there were a large portion of the job-seeking community that were wholesale rejecting this, our clients wouldn’t find the tool useful… This thing would be chronically underperforming for our clients. And we’re just not seeing that—we’re seeing the opposite.”



</p><h2>Job-seekers are dodging AI interviewers&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Social media has been <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@petobsessed777/video/7499996920622992682?q=AI%20interviewer&amp;t=1753974873967" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Go to https://www.tiktok.com/@petobsessed777/video/7499996920622992682?q=AI%20interviewer&amp;t=1753974873967">exploding with</a> job-seekers detailing their AI interviewer <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@meghantheeyogi/video/7532986697219362079?q=AI%20interviewer&amp;t=1753974873967" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Go to https://www.tiktok.com/@meghantheeyogi/video/7532986697219362079?q=AI%20interviewer&amp;t=1753974873967">experiences</a>: describing bots hallucinating and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@loeybugxo/video/7500355242530245930?q=AI%20interviewer&amp;t=1753974873967" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Go to https://www.tiktok.com/@loeybugxo/video/7500355242530245930?q=AI%20interviewer&amp;t=1753974873967">repeating questions</a> on end, calling the robotic <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@sebwhatseb/video/7501713243182746902?q=AI%20interviewer&amp;t=1753974873967" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Go to https://www.tiktok.com/@sebwhatseb/video/7501713243182746902?q=AI%20interviewer&amp;t=1753974873967">conversations awkward</a>, or saying it’s less nerve-wracking than talking to a human. Despite how much hiring managers love AI interviewers, job-seekers aren’t sold on the idea just yet.&nbsp;



</p><p>Allen Rausch, a 56-year-old technical writer who has worked at <a href="https://fortune.com/company/amazon-com/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/amazon-com/">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://fortune.com/company/electronic-arts/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/electronic-arts/">Electronic Arts</a>, has been on the job hunt for two months since getting laid off from his previous role at InvestCloud. In looking for new opportunities, he was “startled” to run into AI interviewers for the first time—let alone on three occasions for separate jobs. All of the meetings would last up to 25 minutes, and featured woman-like cartoons with female voices. It asked basic career questions, running through his resume and details about the job opening, but couldn’t answer any of his questions on the company or culture. 



</p><p>Rausch says he’s only open to doing more AI interviews if they don’t test his writing skills, and if human connection is guaranteed at some point later in the process.



</p><p>“Given the percentage of responses that I’m getting to just basic applications, I think a lot of AI interviews are wasting my time,” he tells <em>Fortune.</em> “I would probably want some sort of a guarantee that, ‘Hey, we’re doing this just to gather initial information, and we are going to interview you with a human being [later].’”</p><p>While Rausch withstood multiple AI interviews, Borchardt couldn’t even sit through a single one. The 64-year-old editorial professional says things went downhill when the robotic interviewer simply ran through her resume, asking her to repeat all of her work experiences at each company listed. The call was impersonal, irritating, and to Borchardt, quite lazy. She ended the interview in less than 10 minutes.&nbsp;



</p><p>“After about the third question, I was like, ‘I’m done.’ I just clicked exit,” she says. “I’m not going to sit here for 30 minutes and talk to a machine… I don’t want to work for a company if the HR person can’t even spend the time to talk to me.”



</p><p>Alex Cobb, a professional now working at U.K. energy company Murphy Group, also encountered an AI interviewer several months ago searching for a new role. While he’s sympathetic towards how many applications HR has to sift through, he finds AI interviewers to be “weird” and ultimately ineffective in fully assessing human applicants. The experience put a bad taste in his mouth, to the point where Cobb won’t pursue any AI-proctored interviews in the foreseeable future.&nbsp;



</p><p>“If I know from looking at company reviews or the hiring process that I will be using AI interviewing, I will just not waste my time, because I feel like it’s a cost-saving exercise more than anything,” Cobb tells <em>Fortune.</em> “It makes me feel like they don’t value my learning and development. It makes me question the culture of the company—are they going to cut jobs in the future because they’ve learned robots can already recruit people? What else will they outsource that to do?”



</p><h2>AI interviewers are a god-send for squeezed hiring managers&nbsp;</h2>



<p>While many job-seekers are backing away from taking AI interviews, hiring managers are accepting the technology with open arms. A large part of it comes from necessity.&nbsp;</p><p>“They’re becoming more common in early-stage screening because they can streamline high-volume hiring,” Priya Rathod, workplace trends editor at Indeed, tells <em>Fortune.</em> “You’re seeing them all over. But for high-volume hiring like customer service or retail or entry-level tech roles, we’re just seeing this more and more… It’s doing that first-stage work that a lot of employers need in order to be more efficient and save time.”



</p><p>It should be noted that not all AI interviewers are created equal—there’s a wide range of AI interviewers entering the market. Job-seekers who spoke with <em>Fortune </em>described monotonous, robotic-voiced bots with pictures of strange feminized avatars. But some AI interviewers, like the one created by Braintrust, distribute a faceless bot with a more natural sounding voice. Its CEO says applicants using the tech are overall happy with their experience—and its hiring manager clientele are enthusiastic, too.&nbsp;



</p><p>However, Jackson admits AI interviewers still have their limitations, despite how revolutionary they are for HR teams.



</p><p>“It does 100 interviews, and it’s going to hand back the best 10 to the hiring manager, and then the human takes over,” he says. “AI is good at objective skill assessment—I would say even better than humans. But [when it comes to] cultural fit, I wouldn’t even try to have AI do that.”

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><figure data-testid="cne-audio-embed-figure"></figure><p>On a sunny afternoon in May, 2015, I joined a dozen other surgeons at a downtown Boston office building to begin sixteen hours of mandatory computer training. We sat in three rows, each of us parked behind a desktop computer. In one month, our daily routines would come to depend upon mastery of Epic, the new medical software system on the screens in front of us. The upgrade from our home-built software would cost the hospital system where we worked, Partners HealthCare, a staggering $1.6 billion, but it aimed to keep us technologically up to date.</p><p>More than ninety per cent of American hospitals have been computerized during the past decade, and more than half of Americans have their health information in the Epic system. Seventy thousand employees of Partners HealthCare—spread across twelve hospitals and hundreds of clinics in New England—were going to have to adopt the new software. I was in the first wave of implementation, along with eighteen thousand other doctors, nurses, pharmacists, lab techs, administrators, and the like.</p><p>The surgeons at the training session ranged in age from thirty to seventy, I estimated—about sixty per cent male, and one hundred per cent irritated at having to be there instead of seeing patients. Our trainer looked younger than any of us, maybe a few years out of college, with an early-Justin Bieber wave cut, a blue button-down shirt, and chinos. Gazing out at his sullen audience, he seemed unperturbed. I learned during the next few sessions that each instructor had developed his or her own way of dealing with the hostile rabble. One was encouraging and parental, another unsmiling and efficient. Justin Bieber took the driver’s-ed approach: You don’t want to be here; I don’t want to be here; let’s just make the best of it.</p><p>I did fine with the initial exercises, like looking up patients’ names and emergency contacts. When it came to viewing test results, though, things got complicated. There was a column of thirteen tabs on the left side of my screen, crowded with nearly identical terms: “chart review,” “results review,” “review flowsheet.” We hadn’t even started learning how to enter information, and the fields revealed by each tab came with their own tools and nuances.</p><p>But I wasn’t worried. I’d spent my life absorbing changes in computer technology, and I knew that if I pushed through the learning curve I’d eventually be doing some pretty cool things. In 1978, when I was an eighth grader in Ohio, I built my own four-kilobyte computer from a mail-order kit, learned to program in <em>BASIC</em>, and was soon playing the arcade game Pong on our black-and-white television set. The next year, I got a an Apple II computer and eventually became the first kid in my school to turn in a computer-printed essay (and, shortly thereafter, the first to ask for an extension “because the computer ate my homework”). As my Epic training began, I expected my patience to be rewarded in the same way.</p><p>My hospital had, over the years, computerized many records and processes, but the new system would give us one platform for doing almost everything health professionals needed—recording and communicating our medical observations, sending prescriptions to a patient’s pharmacy, ordering tests and scans, viewing results, scheduling surgery, sending insurance bills. With Epic, paper lab-order slips, vital-signs charts, and hospital-ward records would disappear. We’d be greener, faster, better.</p><p>But three years later I’ve come to feel that a system that promised to increase my mastery over my work has, instead, increased my work’s mastery over me. I’m not the only one. A 2016 study found that physicians spent about two hours doing computer work for every hour spent face to face with a patient—whatever the brand of medical software. In the examination room, physicians devoted half of their patient time facing the screen to do electronic tasks. And these tasks were spilling over after hours. The University of Wisconsin found that the average workday for its family physicians had grown to eleven and a half hours. The result has been epidemic levels of burnout among clinicians. Forty per cent screen positive for depression, and seven per cent report suicidal thinking—almost double the rate of the general working population.</p><p>Something’s gone terribly wrong. Doctors are among the most technology-avid people in society; computerization has simplified tasks in many industries. Yet somehow we’ve reached a point where people in the medical profession actively, viscerally, volubly hate their computers.</p><p>On May 30, 2015, the Phase One Go-Live began. My hospital and clinics reduced the number of admissions and appointment slots for two weeks while the staff navigated the new system. For another two weeks, my department doubled the time allocated for appointments and procedures in order to accommodate our learning curve. This, I discovered, was the real reason the upgrade cost $1.6 billion. The software costs were under a hundred million dollars. The bulk of the expenses came from lost patient revenues and all the tech-support personnel and other people needed during the implementation phase.</p><p>In the first five weeks, the I.T. folks logged twenty-seven thousand help-desk tickets—three for every two users. Most were basic how-to questions; a few involved major technical glitches. Printing problems abounded. Many patient medications and instructions hadn’t transferred accurately from our old system. My hospital had to hire hundreds of moonlighting residents and pharmacists to double-check the medication list for every patient while technicians worked to fix the data-transfer problem.</p><p>Many of the angriest complaints, however, were due to problems rooted in what Sumit Rana, a senior vice-president at Epic, called “the Revenge of the Ancillaries.” In building a given function—say, an order form for a brain MRI—the design choices were more political than technical: administrative staff and doctors had different views about what should be included. The doctors were used to having all the votes. But Epic had arranged meetings to try to adjudicate these differences. Now the staff had a say (and sometimes the doctors didn’t even show), and they added questions that made their jobs easier but other jobs more time-consuming. Questions that doctors had routinely skipped now stopped them short, with “field required” alerts. A simple request might now involve filling out a detailed form that took away precious minutes of time with patients.</p><p>Rana said that these growing pains were predictable. The Epic people always build in a period for “optimization”—reconfiguring various functions according to feedback from users. “The first week,” he told me, “people say, ‘How am I going to get through this?’ At a year, they say, ‘I wish you could do this and that.’&nbsp;”</p><p>I saw what he meant. After six months, I’d become fairly proficient with the new software. I’d bring my laptop with me to each appointment, open but at my side. “How can I help?” I’d ask a patient. My laptop was available for checking information and tapping in occasional notes; after the consultation, I completed my office report. Some things were slower than they were with our old system, and some things had improved. From my computer, I could now remotely check the vital signs of my patients recovering from surgery in the hospital. With two clicks, I could look up patient results from outside institutions that use Epic, as many now do. For the most part, my clinical routine did not change very much.</p><p>As a surgeon, though, I spend most of my clinical time in the operating room. I wondered how my more office-bound colleagues were faring. I sought out Susan Sadoughi, whom an internist friend described to me as one of the busiest and most efficient doctors in his group. Sadoughi is a fifty-year-old primary-care physician, originally from Iran, who has worked at our hospital for twenty-four years. She’s married to a retired Boston police lieutenant and has three kids. Making time in her work and family schedule to talk to me was revealingly difficult. The only window we found was in the early morning, when we talked by phone during her commute.</p><p>Sadoughi told me that she has four patient slots per hour. If she’s seeing a new patient, or doing an annual physical, she’ll use two slots. Early on, she recognized that technology could contribute to streamlining care. She joined a committee overseeing updates of a home-built electronic-medical-record system we used to rely on, helping to customize it for the needs of her fellow primary-care physicians. When she got word of the new system, she was optimistic. Not any longer. She feels that it has made things worse for her and her patients. Before, Sadoughi almost never had to bring tasks home to finish. Now she routinely spends an hour or more on the computer after her children have gone to bed.</p><p>She gave me an example. Each patient has a “problem list” with his or her active medical issues, such as difficult-to-control diabetes, early signs of dementia, a chronic heart-valve problem. The list is intended to tell clinicians at a glance what they have to consider when seeing a patient. Sadoughi used to keep the list carefully updated—deleting problems that were no longer relevant, adding details about ones that were. But now everyone across the organization can modify the list, and, she said, “it has become utterly useless.” Three people will list the same diagnosis three different ways. Or an orthopedist will list the same generic symptom for every patient (“pain in leg”), which is sufficient for billing purposes but not useful to colleagues who need to know the specific diagnosis (e.g., “osteoarthritis in the right knee”). Or someone will add “anemia” to the problem list but not have the expertise to record the relevant details; Sadoughi needs to know that it’s “anemia due to iron deficiency, last colonoscopy 2017.” The problem lists have become a hoarder’s stash.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>“They’re long, they’re deficient, they’re redundant,” she said. “Now I come to look at a patient, I pull up the problem list, and it means nothing. I have to go read through their past notes, especially if I’m doing urgent care,” where she’s usually meeting someone for the first time. And piecing together what’s important about the patient’s history is at times actually harder than when she had to leaf through a sheaf of paper records. Doctors’ handwritten notes were brief and to the point. With computers, however, the shortcut is to paste in whole blocks of information—an entire two-page imaging report, say—rather than selecting the relevant details. The next doctor must hunt through several pages to find what really matters. Multiply that by twenty-some patients a day, and you can see Sadoughi’s problem.</p><p>The software “has created this massive monster of incomprehensibility,” she said, her voice rising. Before she even sets eyes upon a patient, she is already squeezed for time. And at each step along the way the complexity mounts.</p><p>“Ordering a mammogram used to be one click,” she said. “Now I spend three extra clicks to put in a diagnosis. When I do a Pap smear, I have eleven clicks. It’s ‘Oh, who did it?’ Why not, by default, think that <em>I</em> did it?” She was almost shouting now. “I’m the one putting the order in. Why is it asking me what date, if the patient is in the office today? When do you think this actually happened? It is incredible!” The Revenge of the Ancillaries, I thought.</p><figure><p><span><div data-attr-viewport-monitor=""><a data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a21322&quot;}" href="https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a21322" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><picture></picture></a><p><span>“Don’t judge my client by the covers of the books he reads.”</span></p><p><span>Cartoon by P. C. Vey</span></p></div></span></p></figure><p>She continued rattling off examples like these. “Most days, I will have done only around thirty to sixty per cent of my notes by the end of the day,” she said. The rest came after hours. Spending the extra time didn’t anger her. The pointlessness of it did.</p><p>Difficulties with computers in the workplace are not unique to medicine. Matt Spencer is a British anthropologist who studies scientists instead of civilizations. After spending eighteen months embedded with a group of researchers studying fluid dynamics at Imperial College London, he made a set of observations about the painful evolution of humans’ relationship with software in a 2015 paper entitled “<a data-offer-url="https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/POSC_a_00184?journalCode=posc" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/POSC_a_00184?journalCode=posc&quot;}" href="https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/POSC_a_00184?journalCode=posc" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Brittleness and Bureaucracy</a>.”</p><p>Years before, a graduate student had written a program, called Fluidity, that allowed the research group to run computer simulations of small-scale fluid dynamics—specifically, ones related to the challenge of safely transporting radioactive materials for nuclear reactors. The program was elegant and powerful, and other researchers were soon applying it to a wide range of other problems. They regularly added new features to it, and, over time, the program expanded to more than a million lines of code, in multiple computer languages. Every small change produced unforeseen bugs. As the software grew more complex, the code became more brittle—more apt to malfunction or to crash.</p><p>The I.B.M. software engineer Frederick Brooks, in his classic 1975 book, “<a data-offer-url="https://www.amazon.com/Mythical-Man-Month-Software-Engineering-Anniversary/dp/0201835959/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1541429715&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=The+Mythical+Man-Month" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Mythical-Man-Month-Software-Engineering-Anniversary/dp/0201835959/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1541429715&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=The+Mythical+Man-Month&quot;}" href="https://www.amazon.com/Mythical-Man-Month-Software-Engineering-Anniversary/dp/0201835959/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1541429715&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=The+Mythical+Man-Month" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-aps-asin="0201835959" data-aps-asc-tag="">The Mythical Man-Month</a>,” called this final state the Tar Pit. There is, he said, a predictable progression from a cool program (built, say, by a few nerds for a few of their nerd friends) to a bigger, less cool program product (to deliver the same function to more people, with different computer systems and different levels of ability) to an even bigger, very uncool program system (for even more people, with many different needs in many kinds of work).</p><p>Spencer plotted the human reaction that accompanied this progression. People initially embraced new programs and new capabilities with joy, then came to depend on them, then found themselves subject to a system that controlled their lives. At that point, they could either submit or rebel. The scientists in London rebelled. “They were sick of results that they had gotten one week no longer being reproducible a week later,” Spencer wrote. They insisted that the group spend a year rewriting the code from scratch. And yet, after the rewrite, the bureaucratic shackles remained.</p><p>As a program adapts and serves more people and more functions, it naturally requires tighter regulation. Software systems govern how we interact as groups, and that makes them unavoidably bureaucratic in nature. There will always be those who want to maintain the system and those who want to push the system’s boundaries. Conservatives and liberals emerge.</p><p>Scientists now talked of “old Fluidity,” the smaller program with fewer collaborators which left scientists free to develop their own idiosyncratic styles of research, and “new Fluidity,” which had many more users and was, accordingly, more rule-bound. Changes required committees, negotiations, unsatisfactory split-the-difference solutions. Many scientists complained to Spencer in the way that doctors do—they were spending so much time on the requirements of the software that they were losing time for actual research. “I just want to do science!” one scientist lamented.</p><p>Yet none could point to a better way. “While interviewees would make their resistance known to me,” Spencer wrote, “none of them went so far as to claim that Fluidity could be better run in a different manner.” New Fluidity had capabilities that no small, personalized system could ever provide and that the scientists couldn’t replace.</p><p>The Tar Pit has trapped a great many of us: clinicians, scientists, police, salespeople—all of us hunched over our screens, spending more time dealing with constraints on how we do our jobs and less time simply doing them. And the only choice we seem to have is to adapt to this reality or become crushed by it.</p><p>Many have been crushed. The Berkeley psychologist Christina Maslach has spent years studying the phenomenon of occupational burnout. She focussed on health care early on, drawn by the demanding nature of working with the sick. She defined burnout as a combination of three distinct feelings: emotional exhaustion, depersonalization (a cynical, instrumental attitude toward others), and a sense of personal ineffectiveness. The opposite, a feeling of deep engagement in one’s work, came from a sense of energy, personal involvement, and efficacy. She and her colleagues developed a twenty-two-question survey known as the Maslach Burnout Inventory, which, for nearly four decades, has been used to track the well-being of workers across a vast range of occupations, from prison guards to teachers.</p><p>In recent years, it has become apparent that doctors have developed extraordinarily high burnout rates. In 2014, fifty-four per cent of physicians reported at least one of the three symptoms of burnout, compared with forty-six per cent in 2011. Only a third agreed that their work schedule “leaves me enough time for my personal/family life,” compared with almost two-thirds of other workers. Female physicians had even higher burnout levels (along with lower satisfaction with their work-life balance). A Mayo Clinic analysis found that burnout increased the likelihood that physicians switched to part-time work. It was driving doctors out of practice.</p><p>Burnout seemed to vary by specialty. Surgical professions such as neurosurgery had especially poor ratings of work-life balance and yet lower than average levels of burnout. Emergency physicians, on the other hand, had a better than average work-life balance but the highest burnout scores. The inconsistencies began to make sense when a team at the Mayo Clinic discovered that one of the strongest predictors of burnout was how much time an individual spent tied up doing computer documentation. Surgeons spend relatively little of their day in front of a computer. Emergency physicians spend a lot of it that way. As digitization spreads, nurses and other health-care professionals are feeling similar effects from being screen-bound.</p><p>Sadoughi told me of her own struggles—including a daily battle with her Epic “In Basket,” which had become, she said, clogged to the point of dysfunction. There are messages from patients, messages containing lab and radiology results, messages from colleagues, messages from administrators, automated messages about not responding to previous messages. “All the letters that come from the subspecialists, I can’t read ninety per cent of them. So I glance at the patient’s name, and, if it’s someone that I was worried about, I’ll read that,” she said. The rest she deletes, unread. “If it’s just a routine follow-up with an endocrinologist, I hope to God that if there was something going on that they needed my attention on, they would send me an e-mail.” In short, she hopes they’ll try to reach her at yet another in-box.</p><p>As I observed more of my colleagues, I began to see the insidious ways that the software changed how people work together. They’d become more disconnected; less likely to see and help one another, and often less able to. Jessica Jacobs, a longtime office assistant in my practice—mid-forties, dedicated, with a smoker’s raspy voice—said that each new software system reduced her role and shifted more of her responsibilities onto the doctors. Previously, she sorted the patient records before clinic, drafted letters to patients, prepped routine prescriptions—all tasks that lightened the doctors’ load. None of this was possible anymore. The doctors had to do it all themselves. She called it “a ‘stay in your lane’ thing.” She couldn’t even help the doctors navigate and streamline their computer systems: office assistants have different screens and are not trained or authorized to use the ones doctors have.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>“You can’t learn more from the system,” she said. “You can’t do more. You can’t take on extra responsibilities.” Even fixing minor matters is often not in her power. She’d recently noticed, for instance, that the system had the wrong mailing address for a referring doctor. But, she told me, “all I can do is go after the help desk thirteen times.”</p><p>Jacobs felt sad and sometimes bitter about this pattern of change: “It’s disempowering. It’s sort of like they want any cookie-cutter person to be able to walk in the door, plop down in a seat, and just do the job exactly as it is laid out.”</p><p>Sadoughi felt much the same: “The first year Epic came in, I was so close to saying, ‘That’s it. I’m done with primary care, I’m going to be an urgent-care doctor. I’m not going to open another In Basket.’ It took all this effort reëvaluating my purpose to stick with it.”</p><p>Gregg Meyer sympathizes, but he isn’t sorry. As the chief clinical officer at Partners HealthCare, Meyer supervised the software upgrade. An internist in his fifties, he has the commanding air, upright posture, and crewcut one might expect from a man who spent half his career as a military officer.</p><p>“I’m the veteran of four large-scale electronic-health-records implementations,” he told me in his office, overlooking downtown Boston. Those included two software overhauls in the military and one at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, where he’d become the chief clinical officer. He still sees patients, and he experiences the same frustrations I was hearing about. Sometimes more: he admits he’s not as tech-savvy as his younger colleagues.</p><p>“But we think of this as a system for <em>us</em> and it’s not,” he said. “It is for <em>the patients</em>.” While some sixty thousand staff members use the system, almost ten times as many patients log into it to look up their lab results, remind themselves of the medications they are supposed to take, read the office notes that their doctor wrote in order to better understand what they’ve been told. Today, patients are the fastest-growing user group for electronic medical records.</p><p>Computerization also allows clinicians to help patients in ways that hadn’t been possible before. In one project, Partners is scanning records to identify people who have been on opioids for more than three months, in order to provide outreach and reduce the risk of overdose. Another effort has begun to identify patients who have been diagnosed with high-risk diseases like cancer but haven’t received prompt treatment. The ability to adjust protocols electronically has let Meyer’s team roll out changes far faster as new clinical evidence comes in. And the ability to pull up records from all hospitals that use the same software is driving real improvements in care.</p><p>Meyer gave me an example. “The care of the homeless population of Boston took a quantum leap,” he said. With just a few clicks, “we can see the fact that they had three TB rule-outs”—three negative test results for tuberculosis—“someplace else in town, which means, O.K., I don’t have to put him in an isolation room.”</p><p>In Meyer’s view, we’re only just beginning to experience what patient benefits are possible. A recent study bolsters his case. Researchers looked at Medicare patients admitted to hospitals for fifteen common conditions, and analyzed how their thirty-day death rates changed as their hospitals computerized. The results shifted over time. In the first year of the study, deaths actually increased 0.11 per cent for every new function added—an apparent cost of the digital learning curve. But after that deaths dropped 0.21 per cent a year for every function added. If computerization causes doctors some annoyance but improves patient convenience and saves lives, Meyer is arguing, isn’t it time we all got on board?</p><p>“I’m playing the long game,” he said. “I have full faith that all that stuff is just going to get better with time.”</p><p>And yet it’s perfectly possible to envisage a system that makes care ever better for those who receive it and ever more miserable for those who provide it. Hasn’t this been the story in many fields? The complaints of today’s health-care professionals may just be a white-collar, high-tech equivalent of the century-old blue-collar discontent with “Taylorization”—the industrial philosophy of fragmenting work into components, standardizing operations, and strictly separating those who design the workflow from those who do the work. As Frederick Winslow Taylor, the Progressive Era creator of “scientific management,” put it, “In the past, the man has been first; in the future, the system must be first.” Well, we are in that future, and the system is the computer.</p><p>Indeed, the computer, by virtue of its brittle nature, seems to require that it come first. Brittleness is the inability of a system to cope with surprises, and, as we apply computers to situations that are ever more interconnected and layered, our systems are confounded by ever more surprises. By contrast, the systems theorist David Woods notes, human beings are designed to handle surprises. We’re resilient; we evolved to handle the shifting variety of a world where events routinely fall outside the boundaries of expectation. As a result, it’s the people inside organizations, not the machines, who must improvise in the face of unanticipated events.</p><p>Last fall, the night before daylight-saving time ended, an all-user e-mail alert went out. The system did not have a way to record information when the hour from 1 <em>A.M.</em> to 1:59 <em>A.M.</em> repeated in the night. This was, for the system, a surprise event. The only solution was to shut down the lab systems during the repeated hour. Data from integrated biomedical devices (such as monitoring equipment for patients’ vital signs) would be unavailable and would have to be recorded by hand. Fetal monitors in the obstetrics unit would have to be manually switched off and on at the top of the repeated hour.</p><p>Medicine is a complex adaptive system: it is made up of many interconnected, multilayered parts, and it is meant to evolve with time and changing conditions. Software is not. It is complex, but it does not adapt. That is the heart of the problem for its users, us humans.</p><p>Adaptation requires two things: mutation and selection. Mutation produces variety and deviation; selection kills off the least functional mutations. Our old, craft-based, pre-computer system of professional practice—in medicine and in other fields—was all mutation and no selection. There was plenty of room for individuals to do things differently from the norm; everyone could be an innovator. But there was no real mechanism for weeding out bad ideas or practices.</p><p>Computerization, by contrast, is all selection and no mutation. Leaders install a monolith, and the smallest changes require a committee decision, plus weeks of testing and debugging to make sure that fixing the daylight-saving-time problem, say, doesn’t wreck some other, distant part of the system.</p><p>For those in charge, this kind of system oversight is welcome. Gregg Meyer is understandably delighted to have the electronic levers to influence the tens of thousands of clinicians under his purview. He had spent much of his career seeing his hospitals blighted by unsafe practices that, in the paper-based world, he could do little about. A cardiologist might decide to classify and treat patients with congestive heart failure differently from the way his colleagues did, and with worse results. That used to happen all the time.</p><p>“Now there’s a change-control process,” Meyer said. “When everything touches everything, you have to have change-control processes.”</p><p>But those processes cannot handle more than a few change projects at a time. Artisanship has been throttled, and so has our professional capacity to identify and solve problems through ground-level experimentation. Why can’t our work systems be like our smartphones—flexible, easy, customizable? The answer is that the two systems have different purposes. Consumer technology is all about letting me be me. Technology for complex enterprises is about helping groups do what the members cannot easily do by themselves—work in coördination. Our individual activities have to mesh with everyone else’s. What we want and don’t have, however, is a system that accommodates both mutation and selection.</p><p>Human beings do not only rebel. We also create. We force at least a certain amount of mutation, even when systems resist. Consider that, in recent years, one of the fastest-growing occupations in health care has been medical-scribe work, a field that hardly existed before electronic medical records. Medical scribes are trained assistants who work alongside physicians to take computer-related tasks off their hands. This fix is, admittedly, a little ridiculous. We replaced paper with computers because paper was inefficient. Now computers have become inefficient, so we’re hiring more humans. And it sort of works.</p><p>Not long ago, I spent a day following Lynden Lee as he scribed at a Massachusetts General Hospital primary-care practice. Lee, a twenty-three-year-old graduate of Boston University, is an Asian-American raised in Illinois, and, like many scribes, he was doing the job, earning minimum wage, while he applied to medical school. He worked for Allan Goroll, a seventy-two-year-old internist of the old school—fuzzy eyebrows, steel-wool hair, waist-length white coat.</p><p>Lee, wearing the scribe uniform of neatly tucked oxford shirt and khakis, went to get the morning’s first patient from the waiting room. He’d developed a short speech to introduce himself: “I help take notes, so that Dr. Goroll can spend more time with you instead of typing at the computer. But, of course, if there’s anything you need to say, or would like to discuss with Dr. Goroll, in private, I can certainly leave the room.”</p><figure><p><span><div data-attr-viewport-monitor=""><a data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a22228&quot;}" href="https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a22228" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><picture></picture></a><p><span>“It’s fine to know your ABCs and your colors, but really you just have to be able to sit still and control your bladder.”</span></p><p><span>Cartoon by Barbara Smaller</span></p></div></span></p></figure><p>The first patient was Zoya Shteynberg, a fifty-seven-year-old immigrant from the Soviet Union with copper-red hair and red-rimmed glasses. She is the wife of a dentist, who is also a patient of Goroll’s. “I take care of his whole family—his mother, his wife, their daughters,” he said. “Zoya runs the office.”</p><p>Goroll faced Shteynberg across his desk. To his left, his computer sat untouched. To his right, Lee stood behind a wheeled laptop stand, his fingers already tapping at the keys. He’d pulled up information for Goroll to review as he came in—the notes from Shteynberg’s last visit with him, and recent visits to other specialists—and was starting to write a new medical note. The story Shteynberg told was complex, and unfolded, as medical stories often do, in pieces that were difficult to connect. She had been having sudden, unusual episodes. They sometimes made her short of breath, at other times nauseated. While driving her car, she had an attack in which her heart raced and she felt so light-headed that she feared she might pass out. She had a history of high blood pressure, and she had frequent ear congestion.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Goroll probed and listened, while Lee recorded the details. Every once in a while, the doctor asked Lee to look up information—the trend of her last blood-pressure measurements, or the results of various tests she’d had. He paused to tell Lee how to organize the information: to list faintness, high blood pressure, and ear congestion as three separate problems, not one.</p><p>When it came time for a physical examination, Lee and I stood behind a curtain, giving Shteynberg privacy. Goroll called out his findings for Lee to record. (“Skin: warm and dry, no pallor.”) While Shteynberg dressed, he stood with Lee outside the room and instructed him about tests he wanted done. Lee couldn’t sign any orders, but he could enter them in the computer for Goroll to review and authorize later. We returned to the room, and the doctor summarized his observations for Shteynberg. He wasn’t alarmed, but he had no explanation yet for her episodes. He listed a few possibilities and follow-up tests. Then he told her, “Am I worried about these things? No.”</p><p>She was relieved. “Me, either,” she said.</p><p>Scribes aren’t a perfect solution. Underpaid and minimally trained, they learn mostly on the go, and turn over rapidly (most within months). Research has found error rates between twenty-four and fifty per cent in recording key data; Goroll still spends time after clinic reviewing the charts and correcting errors. But Lee spared him many hours a week, and Goroll was thrilled about it. He got back enough time to start work on the eighth edition of a textbook he has written on primary-care medicine. And, because of his scribe, he was able to give his patient his complete attention throughout the consultation. In recent years, he’d found this increasingly difficult.</p><p>Shteynberg said she was all in favor of scribes: “Because now Dr. Goroll will come right up in front of my eyes, and he listens.” She explained that he used to look at his screen, instead of at her, and type while he spoke.</p><p>“That bothered you?” he asked, surprised.</p><p>“Oh, yes,” she said.</p><p>We are already seeing the next mutation. During the past year, Massachusetts General Hospital has been trying out a “virtual scribe” service, in which India-based doctors do the documentation based on digitally recorded patient visits. Compared with “live scribing,” this system is purportedly more accurate—since the scribes tend to be fully credentialled doctors, not aspiring med students—for the same price or cheaper. IKS Health, which provides the service, currently has four hundred physicians on staff in Mumbai giving support to thousands of patient visits a day in clinics across the United States. The company expects to employ more than a thousand doctors in the coming year, and it has competitors taking the same approach.</p><p>Siddhesh Rane is one of its doctor-scribes. A thirty-two-year-old orthopedic surgeon from a town called Kolhapur, he seemed like any of my surgical colleagues here in Boston, direct, driven, with his photo I.D. swaying on a lanyard around his neck. He’d joined the company for the learning opportunity, he said, not the pay (although many of the IKS staffers were better paid than they would be in a local medical practice).</p><p>He explained the virtual-scribe system to me when we spoke via Skype. With the patient’s permission, physicians record an entire patient visit with a multidirectional microphone, then encrypt and transmit the recording online. In India, Rane listens to the visit and writes a first draft of the office note. Before starting the work, he went through a careful “onboarding” process with each of the American physicians he works with. One, Nathalee Kong, a thirty-one-year-old internist, was based at an M.G.H. clinic in Revere, a working-class community north of Boston. For a week, Rane listened to recordings of her patient visits and observed how she wrote them up. For another week, they wrote parallel notes, to make sure Rane was following Kong’s preferences. They agreed on trigger phrases; when she says to the patient, “Your exam is normal except for&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ,” Rane can record the usual elements of her head-to-toe exam without her having to call each one out.</p><p>A note for a thirty-minute visit takes Rane about an hour to process. It is then reviewed by a second physician for quality and accuracy, and by an insurance-coding expert, who confirms that it complies with regulations—and who, not incidentally, provides guidance on taking full advantage of billing opportunities. IKS Health says that its virtual-scribe service pays for itself by increasing physician productivity—in both the number of patients that physicians see and the amount billed per patient.</p><p>Kong was delighted by the arrangement. “Now all I have to do is listen to the patient and be present,” she told me. When taking a family history, she said, “I don’t have to go back and forth: ‘O.K., so your mom had breast cancer. Let me check that off in the computer before I forget.’ I’m just having a natural conversation with another human being, instead of feeling like I’m checking off a box, which I literally was doing.”</p><p>Before working with Rane, Kong rarely left the office before 7 <em>P.M.</em>, and even then she had to do additional work at home in order to complete her notes. Now she can leave at five o’clock. “I’m hopeful that this prevents me from burning out,” she said. “That’s something I was definitely aware of going into this profession—something that I really feared.” What’s more, she now has the time and the energy to explore the benefits of a software system that might otherwise seem to be simply a burden. Kong manages a large number of addiction patients, and has learned how to use a list to track how they are doing as a group, something she could never have done on her own. She has also learned to use a function that enters a vaccine table into patients’ notes, allowing her to list the vaccinations they should have received and the ones they are missing.</p><p>Her biggest concern now? That the scribes will be taken away. Yet can it really be sustainable to have an additional personal assistant—a fully trained doctor in India, no less—for every doctor with a computer? And, meanwhile, what’s happening across the globe? Who is taking care of the patients all those scribing doctors aren’t seeing?</p><p>There’s a techno-optimist view of how this story will unfold. Big technology companies are already circling to invest in IKS Health. They see an opportunity for artificial intelligence to replace more and more of what Rane does. This prospect doesn’t worry Rane very much; by the time technology has taken his place, he hopes to have set up a clinic of his own, and perhaps get to use the system himself. It’s not hard to believe that our interfaces for documenting and communicating will get easier, more intuitive, less annoying.</p><p>But there’s also a techno-pessimist version of the story. A 2015 study of scribes for emergency physicians in an Atlanta hospital system found that the scribes produced results similar to what my Boston colleagues described—a thirty-six-per-cent reduction in the doctors’ computer-documentation time and a similar increase in time spent directly interacting with patients. Two-thirds of the doctors said that they “liked” or even “loved” having a scribe. Yet they also reported no significant change in their job satisfaction. With the time that scribes freed up, the system simply got doctors to take on more patients. Their workload didn’t lighten; it just shifted.</p><p>Studies of scribes in other health systems have found the same effect. Squeezing more patients into an hour is better than spending time entering data at a keyboard. More people are taken care of. But are they being taken care of well? As patients, we want the caring and the ingenuity of clinicians to be augmented by systems, not defeated by them. In an era of professional Taylorization—of the stay-in-your-lane ethos—that does not seem to be what we are getting.</p><p>Putting the system first is not inevitable. Postwar Japan and West Germany eschewed Taylor’s method of industrial management, and implemented more collaborative approaches than was typical in the U.S. In their factories, front-line workers were expected to get involved when production problems arose, instead of being elbowed aside by top-down management. By the late twentieth century, American manufacturers were scrambling to match the higher quality and lower costs that these methods delivered. If our machines are pushing medicine in the wrong direction, it’s our fault, not the machines’ fault.</p><p>Some people are pushing back. Neil&nbsp;R. Malhotra is a boyish, energetic, forty-three-year-old neurosurgeon who has made his mark at the University of Pennsylvania as something of a tinkerer. He has a knack for tackling difficult medical problems. In the past year alone, he has published papers on rebuilding spinal disks using tissue engineering, on a better way to teach residents how to repair cerebral aneurysms, and on which spinal-surgery techniques have the lowest level of blood loss. When his hospital’s new electronic-medical-record system arrived, he immediately decided to see if he could hack the system.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>He wasn’t a programmer, however, and wasn’t interested in becoming one. So he sought out Judy Thornton, a software analyst from the hospital’s I.T. department. Together, they convened an open weekly meeting, currently on Thursday mornings, where everyone in the neurosurgery department—from the desk clerks to the medical staff to the bosses—could come not just to complain about the system but also to reimagine it. Department members feared that Malhotra’s pet project would be a time sink. Epic heard about his plans to fiddle around with its system and reacted with alarm. The hospital lawyers resisted, too. “They didn’t want us to build something that potentially had a lot of intellectual property in someone else’s system,” Malhotra said.</p><p>But he managed to keep the skeptics from saying no outright. Soon, he and his fellow-tinkerers were removing useless functions and adding useful ones. Before long, they had built a faster, more intuitive interface, designed specifically for neurosurgery office visits. It would capture much more information that really mattered in the care of patients with brain tumors, cerebral aneurysms, or spinal problems.</p><p>Now there was mutation <em>and</em> selection—through a combination of individual ingenuity and group preference. One new feature the department embraced, for instance, enlists the help of patients. At the end of a visit, doctors give the keyboard to patients, who provide their firsthand ratings of various factors that show how they’re progressing: their ability to walk without assistance, or their level of depression and anxiety. The data on mobility before surgery turned out to predict which patients would need to be prepared for time in a rehabilitation center and which ones could go straight home from the hospital.</p><p>Malhotra’s innovations showed that there were ways for users to take at least some control of their technology—to become, with surprising ease, creators. Granted, letting everyone tinker inside our medical-software systems would risk crashing them. But a movement has emerged to establish something like an app store for electronic medical records, one that functions much the way the app store on your smartphone does. If the software companies provided an “application programming interface,” or A.P.I., staff could pick and choose apps according to their needs: an internist could download an app to batch patients’ prescription refills; a pediatric nurse could download one to set up a growth chart.</p><p>Electronic-medical-record companies have fought against opening up their systems this way because of the loss of control (and potential revenue) doing so would entail. In the past couple of years, though, many have begun to bend. Even Epic has launched its “App Orchard.” It’s still in the early stages—only about a hundred apps are available, and there are strict limits on what kinds of customization it enables—but it’s a step in the right direction.</p><p>“You know what I’m excited about?” Malhotra said to me. “Walking.” He had collected data on the walking ability of ten thousand patients—both before and after surgery. “In any set of patients, what is our goal? It’s to maintain mobility or, in many cases, improve it.” Previously, his department could track only rates of survival and complications. Now he’s experimenting with an app that could live on patients’ phones and provide more granular data about their recovery process. “You’d turn on the neurosurgery module when you are seeing us, which would wake up at those time points to give you a notification saying, ‘Hey, can you do these surveys? They help your care, and you can do them on your phone.’&nbsp;”</p><p>I told him about a similar app my research team was experimenting with, which collects step counts, among other measures, after surgery. But we had no way to adjust our electronic medical records so that clinicians could readily find a particular patient’s results.</p><p>“Step counts!” Malhotra said. “Oh, if we just had step counts.” His wheels were turning. What if they made a tab in the electronic medical record with whatever data on activity patients were willing to provide?</p><p>“You could do that?” I said.</p><p>“Sure. Why not?”</p><p>It’s a beguiling vision. Many fear that the advance of technology will replace us all with robots. Yet in fields like health care the more imminent prospect is that it will make us all behave like robots. And the people we serve need something more than either robots or robot-like people can provide. They need human enterprises that can adapt to change.</p><p>It was a Monday afternoon. I was in clinic. I had no scribe, in India or otherwise; no cool app to speed me through my note-writing or serve up all my patient’s information in some nifty, instantly absorbable visual. It was just me, my computer, a file of papers, and John Cameron, a lanky, forty-three-year-old construction supervisor who’d been healthy all his life, felt fine, but was told to see a surgeon for reasons that he still didn’t completely understand.</p><p>It all started, he told me, with a visit to his primary-care provider for a routine physical. I held a printout of the doctor’s note. (My high-tech hack is to have key materials printed out, because it takes too long to flip between screens.) It said that she’d found a calcium level so high it was a wonder that Cameron wasn’t delirious. The internist sent him to an endocrinologist, who found, deep in his electronic records, a forgotten history of several benign skin lesions. The specialist wondered if Cameron had a rare genetic syndrome that’s known to cause tumors and, in turn, hormone abnormalities, skin lesions, and high calcium levels.</p><p>The diagnosis seemed very unlikely, but a battery of tests had turned up surprising results, including abnormal levels of a pituitary hormone. I needed to log into the computer to check the original lab reports. He watched me silently click one tab after another. Minutes passed. I became aware of how long it was taking me to pull up the right results. Finally, I let go of the mouse and took Cameron to the examining table. When I’d finished the exam and we sat down again at my little computer desk against the wall, I told him what I’d determined. He had a parathyroid tumor, it had pushed his calcium levels dangerously high, and it needed to be removed surgically. I took out a pen and paper, and drew a picture to explain how the surgery would be done. First, though, we needed to get his calcium under control. The abnormal levels of the pituitary hormone suggested that he might have a tumor in his pituitary gland as well—and might even have the unusual genetic syndrome. I was less sure about this, I told him, so I wanted to do more testing and get an opinion from an expert at my hospital.</p><p>Cameron’s situation was too complicated for a thirty-minute slot. We’d gone way over time. Other patients were waiting. Plus, I still had to type up all my findings, along with our treatment plan.</p><figure><p><span><div data-attr-viewport-monitor=""><a data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a22297&quot;}" href="https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a22297" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><picture></picture></a><p><span>“Now, when she gets home, just turn your nose up and walk away. Humans love that.”</span></p><p><span>Cartoon by Elisabeth McNair</span></p></div></span></p></figure><p>“Any questions?” I asked, hoping he’d have none.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>“It’s a lot to take in,” he said. “I feel normal. It’s hard to imagine all this going on.” He looked at me, expecting me to explain more.</p><p>I hesitated. Let’s talk after the new tests come back, I said.</p><p>Later, I thought about how unsatisfactory my response was. I’d wanted to put my computer away—to sort out what he’d understood and what he hadn’t, to learn a bit about who he really was, to make a connection. But I had that note to type, and the next patient stewing across the hall.</p><p>The story of modern medicine is the story of our human struggle with complexity. Technology will, without question, continually increase our ability to make diagnoses, to peer more deeply inside the body and the brain, to offer more treatments. It will help us document it all—but not necessarily to make sense of it all. Technology inevitably produces more noise and new uncertainties.</p><p>Perhaps a computer could have alerted me to the possibility of a genetic disorder in John Cameron, based on his history of skin lesions and the finding of high calcium. But our systems are forever generating alerts about possible connections—to the point of signal fatigue. Just ordering medications and lab tests triggers dozens of alerts each day, most of them irrelevant, and all in need of human reviewing and sorting. There are more surprises, not fewer. The volume of knowledge and capability increases faster than any individual can manage—and faster than our technologies can make manageable for us. We ultimately need systems that make the right care simpler for both patients and professionals, not more complicated. And they must do so in ways that strengthen our human connections, instead of weakening them.</p><p>A week or two after my visit with Cameron, I called him to review his laboratory results. A scan had pinpointed a parathyroid tumor in the right side of his neck, which would be straightforward to remove. A test showed that he didn’t have the genetic syndrome, after all, and a brain scan showed no pituitary tumor.</p><p>I had more time for his questions now, and I let him ask them. When we were done and I was about to get off the phone, I paused. I asked him if he’d noticed, during our office visit, how much time I’d spent on the computer.</p><p>“Yes, absolutely,” he said. He added, “I’ve been in your situation. I knew you were just trying to find the information you needed. I was actually trying not to talk too much, because I knew you were in a hurry, but I needed you to look the information up. I wanted you to be able to do that. I didn’t want to push you too far.”</p><p>It was painful to hear. Forced to choose between having the right technical answer and a more human interaction, Cameron picked having the right technical answer. I asked him what he meant about having been in my situation. As a construction-site supervisor, he said, he spends half his day in front of his laptop and half in front of people. His current job was overseeing the construction of a thirty-eight-unit apartment complex in town. “I have to make sure that things are being done per design and the specifications,” he said. That involves looking up lots of information, logging inspection data, and the like. But, at the same time, he has to communicate with lots of people. “I have to be out in the field checking and dealing with subcontractors and employees of our own.”</p><p>The technology at his disposal has grown more powerful in recent years. “We have cloud-based quality-control software, where we document the job at different stages. I can use that information for punch lists and quality-control checks. We also have a time-lapse camera where we can go back and look at things that we might’ve missed.” The technology is more precise, but it’s made everything more complicated and time-consuming. He faces the same struggle that I do.</p><p>Cameron was philosophical about it. He’s worked with big construction companies and small ones and used numerous software systems along the way. He couldn’t do without them. And yet, he said, “all these different technologies and apps on these iPads, all the stuff that I’ve had to use over the years, they’re supposed to make our job easier. But they’re either slow, or they’re cumbersome, or they require a lot of data entry and they’re not efficient.” The system inundates his subcontractors with e-mail alerts, for instance. “&nbsp;‘You gotta submit this, you’re behind on that, you didn’t finish the punch list.’ The project managers and superintendents and subcontractors eventually say, ‘Enough’s enough. We can’t deal with all these e-mails. It’s ridiculous.’ So they ignore them all. Then nothing gets done. You end up on the phone, back to the old-school way. Because it’s a people business.”</p><p>He went on, “I don’t allow anybody to work on my job unless they go through a one-hour orientation with me. I have to know these guys personally. They have to know me. Millions of years human beings evolved to look at each other in the face, to use facial expression to create connection.”</p><p>I’d talked to dozens of experts, but Cameron might have been the wisest of them all. There was something comforting about the way he accepted the inevitability of conflict between our network connections and our human connections. We can retune and streamline our systems, but we won’t find a magical sweet spot between competing imperatives. We can only insure that people always have the ability to turn away from their screens and see each other, colleague to colleague, clinician to patient, face to face.</p><p>The next time I saw Cameron was on the day of his operation. He lay on a stretcher outside the operating room, waiting to be wheeled in. A computer screen on a boom loomed over the bed, showing the safety checks I still had to do.</p><p>I shook Cameron’s hand and was introduced to his wife, who was in a chair beside him. They smiled nervously. It was his first time going under anesthesia. I told them about who would be on the surgical team with me and what was going to happen. I reached for the computer. But then I hesitated. I remembered when I’d turned my back on Cameron at our last encounter.</p><p>“Let’s go through these checks together,” I said.</p><p>I angled the screen toward the couple. Side by side, we confirmed that his medical history was up to date, that the correct surgical site was marked on his body, that I’d reviewed his medication allergies. His shoulders began to relax. His wife’s did, too.</p><p>“Are you ready?” I asked.</p><p>“I am,” he said.&nbsp;♦</p><p>An earlier version of this article mistakenly stated that the author built a one-kilobyte computer in 1978.

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>My &gt;10 year old programming habits have changed since <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code">Claude Code</a> launched. Python is less likely to be my go-to language for new projects anymore. I am managing projects in languages I am not fluent in—TypeScript, Rust and Go—and seem to be doing pretty well.</p>

<p>It seems that typed, compiled, etc. languages are better suited for vibecoding, because of the safety guarantees. This is unsurprising in hindsight, but it was counterintuitive because by default I “vibed” projects into existence in Python since forever.</p>

<p>Paradoxically, after a certain size of project, I can move faster and safer with e.g. Claude Code + Rust, compared to Claude Code + Python, despite the low-levelness of the code<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. This is possible purely because of AI tools.</p>

<p>For example, I refactored large chunks of our TypeScript frontend code at TextCortex. Claude Code runs <code>tsc</code> after finishing each task and ensures that the code compiles before committing. This let me move much faster compared to how I would have done it in Python, which does not provide compile-time guarantees. I am amazed every time how my 3-5k line diffs created in a few hours don’t end up breaking anything, and instead even increase stability.</p>

<p>LLMs are <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/11/11/the-law-of-leaky-abstractions/">leaky abstractions</a>, sure. But they now work well enough so that they solve the problem Python solved for me (fast prototyping), without the disadvantages of Python (lower safety guarantees, slowness, ambiguity<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>).</p>

<p>Because of this, I predict a decrease in Python adoption in companies, specifically for production deployments, even though I like it so much.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>


<p>Suppose you have an appetite for tilting at windmills. Let's say you love pain. Well then why not write a PDF parser today?</p>

<h2>The ideal world: how the specification should work</h2>

<p>Conceptually parsing a PDF is fairly simple:</p>

<ul>
<li>First, locate the version header comment at the start of the file</li>
<li>Next you need to locate the pointer to the cross-reference</li>
<li>Then you can find all object offsets</li>
<li>Finally you locate and build the trailer dictionary which points to the catalog dicitionary</li>
</ul>

<h3>Introduction to PDF objects</h3>

<p>A PDF object wraps some valid PDF content, numbers, strings, dictionaries, etc., in an object and generation number. The content is surrounded by the <code>obj/endobj</code> markers, for example a simple number may have its own PDF object:</p>

<pre><code>16 0 obj
620
endobj
</code></pre>

<p>This declares that object 16 with generation 0 contains the number 620.</p>

<p>A PDF file is effectively a graph of objects that may reference each other. Objects reference other objects by use of indirect references. These have the format "16 0 R" which indicates that the content
should be found in object 16 (generation number 0). In this case that would point to the object 16 containing the number 620. It is up to producer applications to split file content into objects as they wish, though the specification requires that certain object types be indirect.</p>

<h3>Finding the cross-reference offset</h3>

<p>To avoid the need to scan the entire file, PDFs declare a cross-reference table (xref). This is an index pointing to where each object in the file lives.</p>

<p>Each file ends with a pointer to the cross-reference file:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;&lt; %trailer &gt;&gt;
startxref
116
%%EOF
</code></pre>

<p>This tells the parser to jump to byte offset 116 to find the xref table (or stream). In theory this pointer is right at the end of the file, according to the specification:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Applications should read a PDF file from its end. The last line of the file contains only the end-of-file marker, <code>%%EOF</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Though the specification says the <code>%%EOF</code> marker should be on the last line, in practice, things are much messier. For example, Adobe Acrobat only requires it to be within the last 1024 bytes. In real files it can appear anywhere.</p>

<p>In addition files encountered in the wild lacked a linebreak before the offset declaration, or had a typo, e.g. <code>startref</code>.</p>

<p>Let's assume you're able to find the declared cross-reference offset for now.</p>

<h3>Finding all object offsets</h3>

<p>At the specified offset you should find a well-formatted xref table:</p>

<pre><code>xref
7 4
0000000000 65535 f 
0000109882 00000 n 
0000109933 00000 n 
0000140066 00000 n 
</code></pre>

<p>After the <code>xref</code> indicator appears, followed by a line break, the first object number and count of objects in the subsection are given. This means: start at object 7 and list 4 objects. Each line gives the byte offset, generation number, and status (n for in-use, f for free). From this, we know where to find objects 8-10 in the file.</p>

<p>So in the example above -- skipping the free entry for object 7 -- this xref table tells where to find the following objects:</p>

<ul>
<li>Object 8 (generation 0) at offset 109882</li>
<li>Object 9 (generation 0) at offset 109933</li>
<li>Object 10 (generation 0) at offset 140066</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: files can have multiple xref tables or streams, linked by <code>/Prev</code> entries in their trailers.</p>

<h3>Locating the trailer dictionary</h3>

<p>Finally, above the startxref marker, you'll find the trailer dictionary. This provides key metadata, most importantly, where to find the root object. Once you have that, you can follow references and begin interpreting the content.</p>

<h2>The real world: where your pain begins</h2>

<p>Assuming everything is well behaved and you have a reasonable parser for PDF objects this is fairly simple. But you cannot assume everything is well behaved. That would be very foolish, foolish indeed. You're in PDF hell
now. PDF isn't a specification, it's a social construct, it's a vibe. The more you struggle the deeper you sink. You live in the bog now, with the rest of us, far from the sight of God. If your parser expects files to obey the specification it will fail and people will think it is broken and pitiable. They will think that you are very silly.</p>

<h3>The challenges of locating the xref pointer</h3>

<p>We've already mentioned a few unexpected ways locating the pointer to the first cross-reference can fail:</p>

<ul>
<li>It is not at the end of the file, nor within the last 1024 bytes of the file.</li>
<li>It is misspelled.</li>
<li>It is not in the format you'd expect.</li>
</ul>

<p>But assuming you find a pointer, that's where the real fun begins. Because the pointer is not your friend, it is the first lie, you don't appreciate how deep the rabbit hole goes.
In screening 3977 files taken from the <a href="https://digitalcorpora.s3.amazonaws.com/s3_browser.html#corpora/files/CC-MAIN-2021-31-PDF-UNTRUNCATED/">common crawl corpus</a> at random we detected 23 files with a bad xref declaration. This works out to a roughly 0.5% failure rate in the sample set.</p>

<h3>PDF content starting at a non-zero offset</h3>

<p>In these files the <code>startxref</code> pointer is incorrect due to a non-zero PDF content start.</p>

<p>This happens when there's junk data before the <code>%PDF-</code> version header. This shifts every single byte offset in the file.
For example, the declared startxref pointer might be 960, but the actual location is at 970 because of the 10 bytes of junk data at the beginning:</p>

<pre><code>ten bytes!%PDF-1.4
%âãÏÓ
4 0 obj
(content follows)
endobj
% more content
xref
0 5
% ...
&lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;
startxref
960
%%EOF
</code></pre>

<p>In order to adjust for this you should capture the offset of the version header in your file. If the first pointer is incorrect you should also try the offset of the first pointer plus the content start offset. But you still need to check both.</p>

<p>This problem accounted for roughly 50% of errors in the sample set.</p>

<h3>The pointer is in the middle of the xref table</h3>

<p>For some files there is no content preceding the version header, however the pointer is still wrong and it points inside the xref table content at a random offset.</p>

<p>For example jumping directly to the specified offset takes you to this position:</p>

<pre><code>endobj xref
0 246
0000000000 65535 f 
0000184481 00000 n 
00000&lt;---
</code></pre>

<p>This was the case for roughly 5 files in the error set.</p>

<h3>The pointer is 'close' to the xref</h3>

<p>Similar to the previous error, here there is no version header offset but following the pointer takes you 'almost' to the xref. The most common cases were to be off by a single whitespace/newline, or
in the <code>endobj</code> marker of the previous object:</p>

<pre><code>endobj
--&gt; xref
0 4
</code></pre>

<p>or:</p>

<pre><code>--&gt;endobj
xref
0 7
</code></pre>

<h3>The pointer is correct but the xref offsets are incorrect</h3>

<p>Sometimes the pointer correctly jumps to the <code>xref</code> marker but if you parse the object offsets from the table they are incorrect. The table offsets can also be incorrect when the xref offset is also incorrect.</p>

<p>It can also be the case that offsets are correct for some objects in the table but wrong for others. This was the case for file 0002544.pdf in the sample set which had an initial pointer off-by-7. The locations in the xref table's first subsection were correct, then offsets that were off-by-4 bytes for subsequent subsections.</p>

<h3>The first pointer is correct but the previous offset is incorrect</h3>

<p>When a file has been modified the file's trailer (or xref stream dictionary) can contain a <code>/Prev</code> pointer. This is used to construct a chain of xref tables and streams. Several files had correct initial pointers
however when parsing the trailer's previous offset the second location was incorrect. One file contained a value of <code>0</code> for the previous pointer which indicates that it had incorrectly written the
default value, rather than an offset.</p>

<h3>The xref table is not well formatted</h3>

<p>Beyond the xref pointer issues seen in the sample set, the table structure itself can be malformed in unexpected ways.</p>

<p>The following examples were reported as Github issues for <a href="https://github.com/UglyToad/PdfPig">PdfPig</a>.</p>

<p>No linebreak after <code>xref</code>, for example:</p>

<pre><code>xref5 2
0000000000 65535 f 
0000134883 00000 n 
</code></pre>

<p>More object entries in a subsection than declared in the header, for example if only 2 objects are declared the table can contain more:</p>

<pre><code>xref
0 2
0000000000 65535 f 
0000000230 00000 n 
0000000520 00000 n 
0000001000 00000 n 
</code></pre>

<p>Garbage in the middle of the table, for example:</p>

<pre><code>xref
0 2
0000000000 65535 f
0000455.8483a a010 00000 n 
</code></pre>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>We looked at how parsing a PDF should proceed according to the specification. We then compared this with a survey of sample files where we saw a 0.5% error rate due to non-compliant files.
All tested PDF viewers (PDF.js, Adobe, Sumatra) were able to open these files because most parsers are extended to support non-compliant files.</p>

<p>This serves as a brief survey of the challenges of parsing a single part of the PDF specification (22 pages out of 1,300 total from version 1.7).</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <article id="note-content"><h2>How to write a good design document</h2>
<p>This essay is a version of <a href="https://x.com/GrantSlatton/status/1829941438848909778">the response</a> I gave to my friend Vik's call for suggestions:</p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">had a lot of people ask how they can learn to write design docs, and i didn’t have a good answer besides “work at a place with writing culture and smart senior engineers”. anyone have more useful advice? <a href="https://t.co/7F9BV31shv">https://t.co/7F9BV31shv</a></p>— vik (@vikhyatk) <a href="https://twitter.com/vikhyatk/status/1829873886957355139?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 31, 2024</a></blockquote> 
<h2>Definition</h2>
<p>A design document is a technical report that outlines the implementation strategy of a system in the context of trade-offs and constraints.</p>
<h2>Goal</h2>
<p>Think of a design document like a proof in mathematics. The goal of a proof is to convince the reader that the theorem is true. The goal of a design document is to convince the reader the design is optimal given the situation.</p>
<p>The most important person to convince is <em>the author</em>. The act of writing a design document helps to add rigor to what are otherwise vague intuitions. Writing reveals how sloppy your thinking was (and later, code will show how sloppy your writing was).</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>Good design document organization is as important as code organization. You probably have opinions about code organization. You've probably used the phrase "spaghetti code" to describe poorly-organized code. Most programmers write "spaghetti design docs" unless they've had a lot of practice.</p>
<p>Let me illustrate a common code organization issue some programmers run into on their first day. The novice writes</p>
<pre><code>terminal.print("Hello world")
</code></pre>
<p>Then they decide they want to make the text red, so they edit their program to</p>
<pre><code>terminal.print("Hello world")
terminal.setPrintColor("red")
</code></pre>
<p>And then they're confused that it didn't come out red. They haven't internalized that the first line of code <em>happens before</em> the second. They just get a soup of code on the screen that kind of has the ingredients for a program, and expect the computer to do what they want.</p>
<p>Novice document writers make the <em>exact</em> same mistake, but with prose instead of code. They get a soup of sentences and paragraphs and expect the reader's brain to do what they want.</p>
<p>If the reader is smart enough, you might actually get away with this. Just like an expert programmer can mentally untangle spaghetti code.</p>
<p>But a perfect doc is written such that the reader <em>is never surprised</em>. The reader should find that every sentence flows obviously from the previous ones. They should finish your doc and think "well this was entirely straightforward, why did we even need to have this meeting?".</p>
<p>This disappoints the ego-seeking behavior of many engineers. Good engineers often want people to realize how clever they were.</p>
<p>But a good doc will lay out the problem and mental models in a way that the solution that took weeks of hard thought to invent will be clear to the reader by the time the doc presents it.</p>
<p>This also requires having a good model of the minds of the people reading your doc. The goal of your doc is to take their minds from their current state to a new state in which they believe your design is a good one.</p>
<p>You should anticipate every objection someone would have and preemptively show why it's invalid, so that the reader never even thinks to bring it up.</p>
<p>Many engineers fail at modeling the starting state of their readers' minds, so fail at getting them to the destination state.</p>
<h2>Editing</h2>
<p>Once you've got the information organized and laid out properly, the next step is to edit for length. Remove every word that can be removed. Do this because your readers' attention is a scarce resource.</p>
<p>Unless you're an unusually terse writer, you can almost always cut length by ~30% from the first draft without sacrificing information.</p>
<p>The easiest way to get good at editing by going through <em>other</em> people's docs with a red pen and crossing out unnecessary words. You'll find tons. It's easier to criticize other people.</p>
<p>Once you've built this muscle, you can turn the weapon on yourself. Distilling thoughts to fit into the 280 character tweet limit is also surprisingly good practice.</p>
<h2>Volume</h2>
<p>There's no substitute for lots of practice. I'm grateful for having worked at AWS with a unique doc-writing culture. The first docs I wrote there were terrible, but after a few hundred, I like to think they were pretty good.</p>
<p>For unfamiliar readers: Amazon meetings start with the presenter passing out copies (historically physical, though increasingly digital since Covid) of a prose document. The document is 1-6 pages depending on the importance.</p>
<p>The meeting starts with everyone sitting in silence, reading the document, and adding notes and questions in the margins with red pen. Watching people mark up the document you spent so much time polishing is a <em>strong</em> forcing function to become a better writer.</p>
<h2>Concrete tips</h2>
<p>These work for me, but they may not work for you.</p>
<h3>Use short paragraphs</h3>
<p>You should think of your doc as a series of bullet points that flow into each other. That is, a doc might be organized like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Observation A</li>
<li>Observation B</li>
<li>Because B, idea C</li>
<li>But problems D and E</li>
<li>Observation F</li>
<li>Therefore idea G</li>
<li>And improvement H</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of those bullets should be a paragraph that can be summarized in a single sentence. It doesn't need to <em>be</em> a single sentence — you can elaborate where necessary. But, once read, the reader should be able to compress it to a single sentence in their mind.</p>
<p>This is related to the idea of editing, and that your reader's attention is a scarce resource. Your reader has a finite amount of stuff they can juggle in short-term memory. Writing in this "one idea per paragraph" style allows the reader to compress the paragraph and thus consume less of this scarce resource.</p>
<h3>Use an appendix</h3>
<p>If there is some number in the doc that is the result of a complex calculation or simulation, don't include that in the body of the doc. Use a footnote like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A monte-carlo simulation[1] showed the probability of data loss due to corruption is less than 1 in 10^12</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then describe the simulation in more detail in the appendix. The appendix should not be necessary to read to understand the main conclusion of the doc. It's only there for the curious reader to check your work if they want.</p>
<h3>Worked editing example</h3>
<p>Here's a paragraph from above before I edited it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Each one of those bullet points should be its own paragraph in your doc. And each paragraph should be summarizable in a single sentence. The paragraph doesn't need to actually <em>be</em> a single sentence. For example, you might include a few more sentences to really illustrate the whole concept you're trying to convey. But, once the reader has read it, they should be able to compress it to a single sentence in their mind.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And here is the edited version that conveys the exact same information, but smaller:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Each of those bullets should be a paragraph that can be summarized in a single sentence. It doesn't need to <em>be</em> a single sentence — you can elaborate where necessary. But, once read, the reader should be able to compress it to a single sentence in their mind.</p>
</blockquote>

This is an ‘all-hands-on-deck’ moment — we need immediate action on global water security.”</p><p dir="ltr">The researchers evaluated more than two decades of data from U.S.-German Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and GRACE-Follow On (GRACE-FO) missions, looking at how and why terrestrial water storage has changed since 2002. Terrestrial water storage includes all of Earth’s surface and vegetation water, soil moisture, ice, snow and groundwater stored on land.</p>

<p dir="ltr">“It is striking how much nonrenewable water we are losing,” said Hrishikesh A. Chandanpurkar, lead author of the study and a research scientist for ASU.</p><p dir="ltr">“Glaciers and deep groundwater are sort of ancient trust funds. Instead of using them only in times of need, such as a prolonged drought, we are taking them for granted," he said. "Also, we are not trying to replenish the groundwater systems during wet years and thus edging towards an imminent freshwater bankruptcy.”</p><p><h4>Tipping point and worsening continental drying</h4></p><p dir="ltr">The study identified what seems to be a tipping point around 2014–15 during a time considered “mega El-Niño” years. Climate extremes began accelerating and in response, groundwater use increased and continental drying exceeded the rates of glacier and ice sheet melting.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, the study revealed a previously unreported oscillation where after 2014, drying regions flipped from being located mostly in the Southern Hemisphere to mostly in the north, and vice versa for wet regions.</p><p dir="ltr">One of the key drivers contributing to continental drying is the increasing extremes of drought in the mid-latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, for example, in Europe. Additionally, in Canada and Russia, snow, ice and permafrost melting increased over the last decade, and the continued depletion of groundwater globally is a major factor.</p>

<p dir="ltr">In a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0123-1">previous study</a>, members of the team studied terrestrial water storage from satellite data spanning 2002–2016. In the new study, the team looked at more than 20 years of data and discovered a critical, major development in continental drying. Several regional drying patterns and previously identified localized "hot spots" for terrestrial water storage loss are now interconnected — forming the four continental-scale mega-drying regions.</p><p dir="ltr">These include:</p><ul><li><strong>Southwestern North America and Central America</strong>: This region includes major food-producing regions across the American Southwest, along with major desert cities, such as Phoenix, Tucson and Las Vegas, and major metropolitan areas, such as Los Angeles and Mexico City.</li><li><strong>Alaska and Northern Canada</strong>: This region includes melting alpine glaciers in Alaska and British Columbia, snow and permafrost melting across the Canadian high latitudes, and drying in major agricultural regions, such as British Columbia and Saskatchewan.</li><li><strong>Northern Russia</strong>: This region is experiencing major snow and permafrost melting across the high latitudes.</li><li><strong>Middle East-North Africa (MENA) Pan-Eurasia</strong>: This region includes major desert cities, including Dubai, Casablanca, Cairo, Baghdad and Tehran; major food-producing regions, including Ukraine, northwest India and China’s North China Plain region; the shrinking Caspian and Aral Seas; and major cities, such as Barcelona, Paris, Berlin, Dhaka and Beijing.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">In fact, the study showed that since 2002, only the tropics have continued to get wetter on average by latitude, something not predicted by Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change climate models — sophisticated computer programs used to project future climate scenarios.&nbsp;Continuous records are critical in understanding the long-term changes in the water cycle.</p><p dir="ltr">"This study really shows how important it is to have continuous observations of a variable such as terrestrial water storage," Chandanpurkar said. "GRACE records are really getting to the length where we are able to robustly see long-term trends from climate variability. More in-situ observations and data sharing would further support in making this separation and inform water management."</p><div><h4>Why this research matters</h4><p dir="ltr">Research is the invisible hand that powers America’s progress.

The current study highlights the need for ongoing research at scale to inform policymakers and communities about worsening water challenges and opportunities to create meaningful change.</p><p dir="ltr">“This research matters. It clearly shows that we urgently need new policies and groundwater management strategies on a global scale,” said Famiglietti, who is also with the Julie Ann Wrigley Global Futures Laboratory and a former senior water scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. “While efforts to mitigate climate change are facing challenges, we can address continental drying by implementing new policies around regional and international groundwater sustainability. In turn, this will slow the rate of sea-level rise and help preserve water for future generations.”</p><p dir="ltr">The study calls for immediate action to slow and reverse groundwater depletion, protect remaining freshwater resources and adapt to the growing risk of water scarcity and coastal flooding. The research team goes on to say that strategic water management, international cooperation and sustainable policies are essential to preserving water for future generations and mitigating further damage to planetary systems.</p><p dir="ltr">The research will also support an upcoming World Bank Group flagship report that will delve deeper into these findings, including the human and economic implications of continental drying, and present actionable solutions for countries to address the growing freshwater crisis.</p><div><h4>About the study</h4><p dir="ltr">The findings are based on over 22 years of terrestrial water storage data from U.S.-German GRACE and GRACE-FO satellite missions. The full report details the scientific analyses and regional breakdowns of the drying trends, which have proven robust and persistent despite climate variability.</p><p dir="ltr">The research team includes scientists from Arizona State University; Hrishikesh A. Chandanpurkar, FLAME University; John T. Reager and David N. Wiese, JPL; Kaushik Gopalan and Yoshihide Wada, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology; Kauru Kakinuma, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology; and Fan Zhang, The World Bank.</p><p dir="ltr">This research was funded by the Julie Ann Wrigley Global Futures Laboratory at Arizona State University, the GRACE Follow-On Science Team and World Bank Global Water Monitoring.</p></div>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p>Let’s just hop right into it and start with my boldest claim of the summer:</p><blockquote><p><strong>By 2040, the U.S. dollar will no longer be the global reserve currency.</strong></p></blockquote><p>And maybe an even spicier take:</p><blockquote><p><strong>It might not even be the default unit of exchange for Americans back home.</strong></p></blockquote><p><em>Gasp.</em><span> What did he say?! No more Hamiltons for morning Starbucks? No Benjamins for blackjack at Bally’s?! Say it ain’t so. </span></p><p>If you know me personally, you’ve probably heard me spitballing versions of this since we lit the dollar on fire during COVID.</p><p><span>But </span><strong>the last four months</strong><span> have crystallized something for me: this isn’t just some long arc of decline we’ll debate from our rocking chairs. It’s happening. It’s happening now. It will absolutely happen within our lifetime, and I expect likely in the next decade.</span></p><p><span>Before I throw down my 8-Mile-style rap battle against the greenback, I want to call out that </span><strong>there are many dissenters</strong><span>. Plenty of people, who are more credentialed than me on this topic, </span><strong>think I’m</strong><span> </span><strong>totally wrong</strong><span>. Over the last few years I’ve floated this theory in conversation with investment bankers, Fed economists, Treasury staffers, economic historians — all people with front-row seats to the fiscal drama, who in principle should know better.</span></p><p>Without fail, they give me a tight-lipped smirk that says: “cute theory, but the dollar’s not going anywhere”, citing the shear volume of sovereign reserves denominated in USD, the dependence of the global financial system on T-Bills and long-dated treasuries, the lack of a legitimate competitor that can meet the sheer volume of international trade and FX swaps. </p><p><span>They all say the same thing, and all cite the same facts and numbers. </span><em><strong>And that, right there, is exactly why the dollar will be no more.</strong></em></p><p><span>This way of thinking belongs to the category of Dumb Rules™ — the kinds of beliefs that become institutional dogma long after their founding logic has withered. And I’d place “</span><em><strong>The dollar is irreplaceable</strong></em><span>” right at the top of that pile.</span></p><p>So let’s look at three facts that, taken together, tell a different story.</p><p><span>Let’s start on </span><em><strong>Liberation Day</strong><span>, </span><strong>April 2, 2025</strong><span> </span></em><span>(not to be confused with the day before, April Fools Day). </span></p><p>As an aside, “Liberation Day”, has to be one of my favorite Trumpisms — because it was, in fact, a kind of liberation. Not from tyranny or communism or anything drammatic — but from Common Knowledge. Namely, the post WWII belief that free trade is good, globalism is a rising tide that lifts all boats, and that American’s back home are better off using their fingers to scroll iPhone screens, than screw in the bolts near the power jack. </p><p>I digress.</p><p><span>When Trump announced sweeping tariffs (or really just gestured aggressively in their direction, see </span><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_Always_Chickens_Out" rel="">TACO</a></strong><span>), markets freaked out. The S&amp;P dropped over 12%. And that made sense — tariffs should shift prices up, and price hikes should in principle suppress consumer demand. Revenues will drop, corporations will lay off employees to maintain operating margin, unemployment will spike. </span></p><p>Classic recession signal.</p><p><span>So what do markets normally do when a recession is incoming? The yield curve inverts. Institutional capital hides out in long-dated Treasuries. Bond yields fall with the </span><em>expectation </em><span>that the Fed will step in and make money cheap to restart the business cycle, incentivizing capex and job creation.</span></p><p>Except… they didn’t.</p><p><span>Instead, Treasury yields </span><strong>spiked.</strong></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!eYS7!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F42420afe-6e33-461e-86c2-89a8db5b63bb_1302x1224.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!eYS7!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F42420afe-6e33-461e-86c2-89a8db5b63bb_1302x1224.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!eYS7!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F42420afe-6e33-461e-86c2-89a8db5b63bb_1302x1224.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!eYS7!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F42420afe-6e33-461e-86c2-89a8db5b63bb_1302x1224.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!eYS7!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F42420afe-6e33-461e-86c2-89a8db5b63bb_1302x1224.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!eYS7!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F42420afe-6e33-461e-86c2-89a8db5b63bb_1302x1224.png" width="420" height="394.83870967741933" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/42420afe-6e33-461e-86c2-89a8db5b63bb_1302x1224.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1224,&quot;width&quot;:1302,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:420,&quot;bytes&quot;:193153,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://mathmeetsmoney.substack.com/i/169930545?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F42420afe-6e33-461e-86c2-89a8db5b63bb_1302x1224.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!eYS7!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F42420afe-6e33-461e-86c2-89a8db5b63bb_1302x1224.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!eYS7!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F42420afe-6e33-461e-86c2-89a8db5b63bb_1302x1224.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!eYS7!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F42420afe-6e33-461e-86c2-89a8db5b63bb_1302x1224.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!eYS7!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F42420afe-6e33-461e-86c2-89a8db5b63bb_1302x1224.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>This was the opposite of what happened in ’81, ’90, ’01, ’08, or even 2020.

The days of an inverted yield curve are over.

Janet Yellen’s decision to issue </span><strong>mostly short-dated bonds</strong><span> even when interest rates were scraping the floor following COVID. </span></p><p>Seems insane, right? Why lock in short-term liabilities when long-term money was practically free after the pandemic?</p><p>Because Treasury saw the elephant in the room. As Janet shopped around bonds to anyone that would take a meeting, China, Japan, Europe — there was no appetite for 30 year U.S. bonds with interest rates under 2% when Debt-to-GDP was above 120% following COVID stimulus. The market wouldn’t touch them — even if we asked.</p><p><em><strong>So it wasn’t worth asking</strong></em><span> — because again, at this point, Treasury and Fed are just managing optics. So instead of refinancing our liabilities at historic lows, we front-loaded the interest burden. Which means the window for monetary discretion — raising or lowering rates, modulating the money supply, nudging inflation — is effectively closed. </span></p><p><span>At this point, lowering rates will be seen as an inflationary signal, and the bond market will punish us in turn. </span><strong><a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/weak-demand-japans-40-year-debt-auction-shows-fiscal-stress-2025-05-28/" rel="">Just ask Japan</a></strong><span>. </span></p><p><span>So we have a predicament - </span><strong>we can’t lower rates</strong><span> anymore without spiking long term yields - and </span><strong>we can’t hike rates</strong><span> without blowing up the budget with debt servicing payments. Why? Because the last time we hiked rates to save the dollar, we were in a completely different fiscal position. </span></p><p>Take a look at the Debt/GDP since the 60s,</p><div><figure><a target="_blank"

This lead to a debt death spiral, and would spell the end of the dollar. </p><blockquote><p><em><strong>So Treasury and The Fed’s hands are tied - the dollar is currently squeezed by fiscal uncertainty.</strong></em><span> </span></p></blockquote><p><span>That means the American institution that is left in control of the dollar’s fate by keeping spending (and thus the debt) under control is…. </span><strong>Congress.</strong><span> </span></p><p>LOL. Yikes.</p><p>This is where things get a little less spicy and I can just say what everyone else already knows: </p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Congress is inept and will continue to spend above our means because it is politically expedient to do so for the party with the purse strings that happens to be in power.</strong></em><span> </span></p></blockquote><p><span>Indeed, there’s a long history of this. The political turbulence that we see in congress isn’t just unsettling — </span><strong>it’s expensive</strong><span>. </span></p><p><span>This is also true of the Executive branch: </span><em><strong>new administrations always spend more than those that have just been re-elected</strong></em><span> — pushing the obligation of fiscal responsibility onto the next guy. In fact, </span><em><strong>all of the increases to Debt/GDP</strong></em><span> have come in the first term of US presidents:</span></p><blockquote><p><strong>Fact 1</strong><span>: First-term presidents grow the nominal debt by ~13% per year.</span></p><p><strong>Fact 2</strong><span>: Second-term presidents grow it by ~6% per year.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>In other words, while governing is expensive, it’s manageable (nominal GDP has grown at 6% a year dating back to the 1950s) — </span><strong>but fulfilling campaign promises is reckless</strong><span>. And yes, I would consider Trump 47 a second round at a </span><strong>first-term presidency</strong><span> — and when viewed in those terms, the spending in the </span><strong><a href="https://www.crfb.org/blogs/cbo-score-shows-senate-obbba-adds-over-39-trillion-debt" rel="">OBBB</a></strong><span> is par for the course.</span></p><p>This is nothing new. </p><p><span>Our political system </span><em>encourages</em><span> irresponsible spending every time power changes hands. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the Inflation Reduction Act — massive trillion-dollar bills dropped in politically volatile environments. Because no one wants to be the adult in the room anymore and say “you know all those things I campaigned on? It turns out we can’t afford it”. </span></p><p>So this brings us to my second projection:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Projection 2</strong><span>: </span><em><span>Election cycles for the next 20 years will remained deadlocked at a 50/50 toss up. The tie break will be given to whoever moderate and centrist voters hate the least — i.e. </span><strong>the new and unvetted candidate</strong><span>. As we oscillate back and forth between one four-year term after another, the new administration will do what they’ve done for 50 years —</span></em><span> </span><em><strong>spend without abandon</strong><span>, only to get voted out before they had time to realize they represented The People, not The Party. </span></em></p></blockquote><p><span>When no one wants to be the adult, the kids run the house - and </span><em><strong>kids don’t worry about paying down the mortgage</strong></em><span>.</span></p><p>And sadly, the adults in the room are slowly getting cannibalized by the Lost Boys.</p><p><em><strong>This, to me, is the final nail.</strong></em></p><p>The Fed is the last American institution left with any pretense of independence. But in the past year, we've seen that too begin to crack. The Administration publicly criticizes the Fed’s decisions, which I will admit is not new (Reagan was a very vocal critic of Volcker’s Fed, and even suggested he would “go visit them in-person” like a mob boss — which at the time was unheard of). </p><p><span>However, </span><em><strong>what is new</strong></em><span> is fabricating grounds for a premature dismissal — with talk of firing Jerome Powell “for cause.” Indeed, we just saw the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics pushed out for alleged political bias — on grounds that the very data that can inform the Federal Reserve committee was itself politically biased. </span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank"

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://kashw1n.com/blog/nodejs-2025/">https://kashw1n.com/blog/nodejs-2025/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44778936">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-astro-cid-7jjqptxk=""> <p><img src="https://kashw1n.com/static/nodejs-2025.png" alt="Modern Node.js development workflow" width="400"></p><p>Node.js has undergone a remarkable transformation since its early days. If you’ve been writing Node.js for several years, you’ve likely witnessed this evolution firsthand—from the callback-heavy, CommonJS-dominated landscape to today’s clean, standards-based development experience.</p>
<p>The changes aren’t just cosmetic; they represent a fundamental shift in how we approach server-side JavaScript development. Modern Node.js embraces web standards, reduces external dependencies, and provides a more intuitive developer experience. Let’s explore these transformations and understand why they matter for your applications in 2025.</p>
<h2 id="1-module-system-esm-is-the-new-standard">1. Module System: ESM is the New Standard</h2>
<p>The module system is perhaps where you’ll notice the biggest difference. CommonJS served us well, but ES Modules (ESM) have become the clear winner, offering better tooling support and alignment with web standards.</p>
<h3 id="the-old-way-commonjs">The Old Way (CommonJS)</h3>
<p>Let’s look at how we used to structure modules. This approach required explicit exports and synchronous imports:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="javascript"><code><span><span>// math.js</span></span>
<span><span>function</span><span> add</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>, </span><span>b</span><span>) {</span></span>
<span><span>  return</span><span> a</span><span> +</span><span> b</span><span>;</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span>
<span><span>module</span><span>.</span><span>exports</span><span> =</span><span> { </span><span>add</span><span> };</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>// app.js</span></span>
<span><span>const</span><span> { </span><span>add</span><span> } </span><span>=</span><span> require</span><span>(</span><span>'./math'</span><span>);</span></span>
<span><span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>add</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>, </span><span>3</span><span>));</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre>
<p>This worked fine, but it had limitations—no static analysis, no tree-shaking, and it didn’t align with browser standards.</p>
<h3 id="the-modern-way-es-modules-with-node-prefix">The Modern Way (ES Modules with Node: Prefix)</h3>
<p>Modern Node.js development embraces ES Modules with a crucial addition—the <code>node:</code> prefix for built-in modules. This explicit naming prevents confusion and makes dependencies crystal clear:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="javascript"><code><span><span>// math.js</span></span>
<span><span>export</span><span> function</span><span> add</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>, </span><span>b</span><span>) {</span></span>
<span><span>  return</span><span> a</span><span> +</span><span> b</span><span>;</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>// app.js</span></span>
<span><span>import</span><span> { </span><span>add</span><span> } </span><span>from</span><span> './math.js'</span><span>;</span></span>
<span><span>import</span><span> { </span><span>readFile</span><span> } </span><span>from</span><span> 'node:fs/promises'</span><span>;  </span><span>// Modern node: prefix</span></span>
<span><span>import</span><span> { </span><span>createServer</span><span> } </span><span>from</span><span> 'node:http'</span><span>;</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>add</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>, </span><span>3</span><span>));</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre>
<p>The <code>node:</code> prefix is more than just a convention—it’s a clear signal to both developers and tools that you’re importing Node.js built-ins rather than npm packages. This prevents potential conflicts and makes your code more explicit about its dependencies.</p>
<h3 id="top-level-await-simplifying-initialization">Top-Level Await: Simplifying Initialization</h3>
<p>One of the most game-changing features is top-level await. No more wrapping your entire application in an async function just to use await at the module level:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="javascript"><code><span><span>// app.js - Clean initialization without wrapper functions</span></span>
<span><span>import</span><span> { </span><span>readFile</span><span> } </span><span>from</span><span> 'node:fs/promises'</span><span>;</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>const</span><span> config</span><span> =</span><span> JSON</span><span>.</span><span>parse</span><span>(</span><span>await</span><span> readFile</span><span>(</span><span>'config.json'</span><span>, </span><span>'utf8'</span><span>));</span></span>
<span><span>const</span><span> server</span><span> =</span><span> createServer</span><span>(</span><span>/* ... */</span><span>);</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>'App started with config:'</span><span>, </span><span>config</span><span>.</span><span>appName</span><span>);</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre>
<p>This eliminates the common pattern of immediately-invoked async function expressions (IIFE) that we used to see everywhere. Your code becomes more linear and easier to reason about.</p>
<h2 id="2-built-in-web-apis-reducing-external-dependencies">2. Built-in Web APIs: Reducing External Dependencies</h2>
<p>Node.js has embraced web standards in a big way, bringing APIs that web developers already know directly into the runtime. This means fewer dependencies and more consistency across environments.</p>
<h3 id="fetch-api-no-more-http-library-dependencies">Fetch API: No More HTTP Library Dependencies</h3>
<p>Remember when every project needed axios, node-fetch, or similar libraries for HTTP requests? Those days are over. Node.js now includes the Fetch API natively:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="javascript"><code><span><span>// Old way - external dependencies required</span></span>
<span><span>const</span><span> axios</span><span> =</span><span> require</span><span>(</span><span>'axios'</span><span>);</span></span>
<span><span>const</span><span> response</span><span> =</span><span> await</span><span> axios</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>'https://api.example.com/data'</span><span>);</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>// Modern way - built-in fetch with enhanced features</span></span>
<span><span>const</span><span> response</span><span> =</span><span> await</span><span> fetch</span><span>(</span><span>'https://api.example.com/data'</span><span>);</span></span>
<span><span>const</span><span> data</span><span> =</span><span> await</span><span> response</span><span>.</span><span>json</span><span>();</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre>
<p>But the modern approach goes beyond just replacing your HTTP library. You get sophisticated timeout and cancellation support built-in:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="javascript"><code><span><span>async</span><span> function</span><span> fetchData</span><span>(</span><span>url</span><span>) {</span></span>
<span><span>  try</span><span> {</span></span>
<span><span>    const</span><span> response</span><span> =</span><span> await</span><span> fetch</span><span>(</span><span>url</span><span>, {</span></span>
<span><span>      signal</span><span>: </span><span>AbortSignal</span><span>.</span><span>timeout</span><span>(</span><span>5000</span><span>) </span><span>// Built-in timeout support</span></span>
<span><span>    });</span></span>
<span><span>    </span></span>
<span><span>    if</span><span> (</span><span>!</span><span>response</span><span>.</span><span>ok</span><span>) {</span></span>
<span><span>      throw</span><span> new</span><span> Error</span><span>(</span><span>`HTTP </span><span>${</span><span>response</span><span>.</span><span>status</span><span>}</span><span>: </span><span>${</span><span>response</span><span>.</span><span>statusText</span><span>}</span><span>`</span><span>);</span></span>
<span><span>    }</span></span>
<span><span>    </span></span>
<span><span>    return</span><span> await</span><span> response</span><span>.</span><span>json</span><span>();</span></span>
<span><span>  } </span><span>catch</span><span> (</span><span>error</span><span>) {</span></span>
<span><span>    if</span><span> (</span><span>error</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span> ===</span><span> 'TimeoutError'</span><span>) {</span></span>
<span><span>      throw</span><span> new</span><span> Error</span><span>(</span><span>'Request timed out'</span><span>);</span></span>
<span><span>    }</span></span>
<span><span>    throw</span><span> error</span><span>;</span></span>
<span><span>  }</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre>
<p>This approach eliminates the need for timeout libraries and provides a consistent error handling experience. The <code>AbortSignal.timeout()</code> method is particularly elegant—it creates a signal that automatically aborts after the specified time.</p>
<h3 id="abortcontroller-graceful-operation-cancellation">AbortController: Graceful Operation Cancellation</h3>
<p>Modern applications need to handle cancellation gracefully, whether it’s user-initiated or due to timeouts. AbortController provides a standardized way to cancel operations:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="javascript"><code><span><span>// Cancel long-running operations cleanly</span></span>
<span><span>const</span><span> controller</span><span> =</span><span> new</span><span> AbortController</span><span>();</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>// Set up automatic cancellation</span></span>
<span><span>setTimeout</span><span>(() </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> controller</span><span>.</span><span>abort</span><span>(), </span><span>10000</span><span>);</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>try</span><span> {</span></span>
<span><span>  const</span><span> data</span><span> =</span><span> await</span><span> fetch</span><span>(</span><span>'https://slow-api.com/data'</span><span>, {</span></span>
<span><span>    signal</span><span>: </span><span>controller</span><span>.</span><span>signal</span></span>
<span><span>  });</span></span>
<span><span>  console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>'Data received:'</span><span>, </span><span>data</span><span>);</span></span>

<p>This provides visibility into application performance without external dependencies, helping you identify bottlenecks early in development.</p>
<h2 id="9-application-distribution-and-deployment">9. Application Distribution and Deployment</h2>
<p>Modern Node.js makes application distribution simpler with features like single executable applications and improved packaging.</p>
<h3 id="single-executable-applications">Single Executable Applications</h3>
<p>You can now bundle your Node.js application into a single executable file, simplifying deployment and distribution:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="bash"><code><span><span># Create a self-contained executable</span></span>
<span><span>node</span><span> --experimental-sea-config</span><span> sea-config.json</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre>
<p>The configuration file defines how your application gets bundled:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="json"><code><span><span>{</span></span>
<span><span>  "main"</span><span>: </span><span>"app.js"</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>  "output"</span><span>: </span><span>"my-app-bundle.blob"</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>  "disableExperimentalSEAWarning"</span><span>: </span><span>true</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre>
<p>This is particularly valuable for CLI tools, desktop applications, or any scenario where you want to distribute your application without requiring users to install Node.js separately.</p>
<h2 id="10-modern-error-handling-and-diagnostics">10. Modern Error Handling and Diagnostics</h2>
<p>Error handling has evolved beyond simple try/catch blocks to include structured error handling and comprehensive diagnostics.</p>
<h3 id="structured-error-handling">Structured Error Handling</h3>
<p>Modern applications benefit from structured, contextual error handling that provides better debugging information:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="javascript"><code><span><span>class</span><span> AppError</span><span> extends</span><span> Error</span><span> {</span></span>

<span></span></code></pre>
<p>This approach provides much richer error information for debugging and monitoring, while maintaining a consistent error interface across your application.</p>
<h3 id="advanced-diagnostics">Advanced Diagnostics</h3>
<p>Node.js includes sophisticated diagnostic capabilities that help you understand what’s happening inside your application:</p>

<span><span>  }</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre>
<p>This diagnostic information can be consumed by monitoring tools, logged for analysis, or used to trigger automatic remediation actions.</p>
<h2 id="11-modern-package-management-and-module-resolution">11. Modern Package Management and Module Resolution</h2>
<p>Package management and module resolution have become more sophisticated, with better support for monorepos, internal packages, and flexible module resolution.</p>
<h3 id="import-maps-and-internal-package-resolution">Import Maps and Internal Package Resolution</h3>
<p>Modern Node.js supports import maps, allowing you to create clean internal module references:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="json"><code><span><span>{</span></span>
<span><span>  "imports"</span><span>: {</span></span>
<span><span>    "#config"</span><span>: </span><span>"./src/config/index.js"</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>    "#utils/*"</span><span>: </span><span>"./src/utils/*.js"</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>    "#db"</span><span>: </span><span>"./src/database/connection.js"</span></span>
<span><span>  }</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre>
<p>This creates a clean, stable interface for internal modules:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="javascript"><code><span><span>// Clean internal imports that don't break when you reorganize</span></span>
<span><span>import</span><span> config</span><span> from</span><span> '#config'</span><span>;</span></span>

<span><span>import</span><span> db</span><span> from</span><span> '#db'</span><span>;</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre>
<p>These internal imports make refactoring easier and provide a clear distinction between internal and external dependencies.</p>
<h3 id="dynamic-imports-for-flexible-loading">Dynamic Imports for Flexible Loading</h3>
<p>Dynamic imports enable sophisticated loading patterns, including conditional loading and code splitting:</p>

<p>This pattern allows you to build applications that adapt to their environment and only load the code they actually need.</p>
<h2 id="the-path-forward-key-takeaways-for-modern-nodejs-2025">The Path Forward: Key Takeaways for Modern Node.js (2025)</h2>
<p>As we look at the current state of Node.js development, several key principles emerge:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Embrace Web Standards</strong>: Use <code>node:</code> prefixes, fetch API, AbortController, and Web Streams for better compatibility and reduced dependencies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Leverage Built-in Tools</strong>: The test runner, watch mode, and environment file support reduce external dependencies and configuration complexity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Think in Modern Async Patterns</strong>: Top-level await, structured error handling, and async iterators make code more readable and maintainable</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Use Worker Threads Strategically</strong>: For CPU-intensive tasks, worker threads provide true parallelism without blocking the main thread</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Adopt Progressive Enhancement</strong>: Use permission models, diagnostics channels, and performance monitoring to build robust, observable applications</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Optimize for Developer Experience</strong>: Watch mode, built-in testing, and import maps create a more pleasant development workflow</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Plan for Distribution</strong>: Single executable applications and modern packaging make deployment simpler</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The transformation of Node.js from a simple JavaScript runtime to a comprehensive development platform is remarkable. By adopting these modern patterns, you’re not just writing contemporary code—you’re building applications that are more maintainable, performant, and aligned with the broader JavaScript ecosystem.</p>
<p>The beauty of modern Node.js lies in its evolution while maintaining backward compatibility. You can adopt these patterns incrementally, and they work alongside existing code. Whether you’re starting a new project or modernizing an existing one, these patterns provide a clear path toward more robust, enjoyable Node.js development.</p>
<p>As we move through 2025, Node.js continues to evolve, but the foundational patterns we’ve explored here provide a solid base for building applications that will remain modern and maintainable for years to come.</p> </div></div>]]></description>

    <p>The Trump administration’s <a href="https://www.deseret.com/the-west/2025/07/14/national-park-service-budget-staffing-cuts-doge-doug-burgum/">cuts to the National Park Service’s budget</a> and staffing have raised <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/may/12/trump-is-laying-the-groundwork-to-privatize-americas-national-parks">concerns among park advocates and the public</a> that the administration is aiming to further privatize the national parks.</p>

<p>The nation has a long history of similar efforts, including a wildly unpopular 1980 attempt by Reagan administration Interior Secretary James Watt to <a href="https://www.nps.gov/parkhistory/online_books/runte1/epilogue.htm">promote development and expand private concessions</a> in the parks. But debate over using public national park land for private profit dates back more than a century before that.</p>

<p>As I explain in <a href="https://www.nebraskapress.unl.edu/nebraska/9781496239587/the-mountains-are-calling/">my forthcoming book</a>, no park has played a more central role in that debate than Yosemite, in California. </p>

<h2>Early concerns</h2>

<p>In early 1864, Central American Steamship Transit Company representative Israel Ward Raymond wrote a letter to John Conness, a U.S. senator from California, <a href="https://www.nps.gov/parkhistory/online_books/runte2/chap2.htm">urging the government to move swiftly</a> to preserve the Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Grove of giant sequoia trees to prevent them from falling into private hands. Five months later, President Abraham Lincoln signed the Yosemite Grant Act, ceding the valley and the grove to the state of California, “upon the express conditions that the premises shall be <a href="https://www.loc.gov/item/today-in-history/june-30/">held for public use, resort, and recreation</a>.” This was years before Yellowstone became the <a href="https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/act-establishing-yellowstone-national-park">first federal land designated a national park</a> in 1872.</p>

<p>Controversy arose quickly at Yosemite. Two men – James Lamon and James Hutchings – had <a href="https://www.nps.gov/parkhistory/online_books/runte2/chap2.htm">claimed land in the valley</a> before the federal government gave it to California. Both began commercial operations, <a href="https://home.nps.gov/yose/blogs/the-first-pioneer-settler-of-yosemite-valley.htm">Lamon growing cash crops</a> and <a href="https://www.nps.gov/yose/learn/historyculture/hutchings.htm">Hutchings operating a hotel</a>.</p>

<p>California said their businesses threatened the state’s ability to develop roads and trails in Yosemite by competing for tourist dollars. A legal battle ensued and was not resolved until an <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/82/77/">1872 U.S. Supreme Court ruling</a> found that the men’s land claims had not been fully validated according to the procedures of the time. The California legislature <a href="https://home.nps.gov/yose/blogs/the-first-pioneer-settler-of-yosemite-valley.htm">paid both men compensation for their land</a>, and both left the park.</p>

<p>In 1890, <a href="https://www.nps.gov/yose/learn/news/yosemite-national-park-commemorates-its-125th-anniversary.htm?fullweb=1">neighboring parts of the Yosemite area</a> became America’s third national park – and in 1906, the federal government again took possession of the Yosemite Valley itself and the Mariposa Grove, specifically to <a href="https://www.nps.gov/yose/learn/historyculture/thenandnow.htm">incorporate them into an expansion of the national park</a>.</p>

<h2>Development rights</h2>

<p>Yet, as my research has found, the role of private interests in the park remained unsolved. Private companies under contract to the National Park Service have long provided needed amenities <a href="https://www.nps.gov/subjects/concessions/index.htm">such as lodging and food</a> within the national parks. But questions over what is acceptable in national parks in the pursuit of profit have shaped Yosemite’s history for generations.</p>

<p>In 1925, I found, the question centered on the right to build the first gas station inside the park, in Yosemite Valley. Two private businesses, the Curry Camping Company and the Yosemite National Park Company, had long competed for tourist dollars within the park. Each wanted to build a gas station to boost profits.</p>

<p><a href="https://npshistory.com/publications/yose/camp_curry_clr.pdf#page=187">Frustrated over the need to decide</a>, National Park Service Director Horace Albright ordered the rival firms to simplify management of the park’s concessions. The companies merged, and the newly formed Yosemite Park and Curry Company was granted the exclusive rights to run lodges, restaurants and other facilities within the park, including the new gas station.</p>

<p>But as I found in my research, the park service and the concessions company did not always see eye to eye on the purpose of the park. The conflict between profit and preservation is perhaps most clearly illustrated by the construction of a ski area within the park in the early 1930s. The park service initially opposed the development of Badger Pass Ski Area as <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/26555031">not conducive to the national park ideal</a>, but the Yosemite Park and Curry Company insisted it was key to boosting winter use of the park.</p>

<p>In 1973, the Music Corporation of America, an entertainment conglomerate, bought the Yosemite Park and Curry Company. The company already had a tourist attraction operating near Hollywood, where visitors could <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1990-11-27-fi-5451-story.html">pay to tour movie sets</a>, but had not yet changed its name to Universal Studios or launched major theme parks in Florida and California. Its purchase of the park’s concessions set off a <a href="https://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/1974-october">firestorm of controversy</a> over fears of turning Yosemite into a theme park.</p>

<p>That didn’t happen, but annual park visitor numbers climbed <a href="https://irma.nps.gov/Stats/SSRSReports/Park%20Specific%20Reports/Annual%20Park%20Recreation%20Visitation%20Graph%20(1904%20-%20Last%20Calendar%20Year)?Park=YOSE">from 2.5 million to 3.8 million</a> over the 20 years MCA ran the concessions, which sparked concerns about development and overcrowding in the park. Conservationists argued the park service had allowed the corporate giant to promote and develop the park in ways that threatened the very <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/26555031">aspects of the park most people came to enjoy</a>.</p>

<p>With three restaurants, two service stations with a total of 15 gas pumps, two cafeterias, two grocery stores, seven souvenir shops, a delicatessen, a bank, a skating rink, three swimming pools, a golf course, two tennis courts, kennels, a barbershop, a beauty shop, Badger Pass Ski Area and three lodges, the Yosemite Valley was a <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/26555031">busy commercial district</a>. Critics argued that such development contradicted the park service’s mandate to leave national parks <a href="https://www.nps.gov/aboutus/index.htm">unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations</a>.</p>

<h2>Who owns the names?</h2>

<p>Falling profits and consolidation within the music industry led MCA to sell its concessions rights in Yosemite in 1993. The Delaware North Companies, a global hospitality corporation, took over and <a href="https://www.kvpr.org/business-economy/2015-06-17/longtime-yosemite-concessionaire-is-out-as-nps-selects-aramark">ran the park’s concessions</a> until 2016, when it sold the rights to Aramark.</p>

<p>But in that sale, the question of public resources and private profits arose again. Delaware North <a href="https://niagarafallsreporter.com/delaware-north-loses-yosemite-contract-can-niagara-falls-state-park-be-next-2/">demanded $51 million in compensation</a> for Aramark continuing to use the names of several historic properties within the park, such as the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/places/000/the-ahwahnee.htm">Ahwahnee, a hotel</a>, and <a href="https://www.nps.gov/places/000/curry-village.htm">Curry Village</a>, another group of visitor accommodations. The company claimed those names were a part of its assets under its contract with the park service.</p>

<p>The park service rejected the claim, saying the names, which dated back more than a century, belonged to the American people. But to avoid legal problems during the transition, the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/yose/learn/news/yosemite-national-park-to-change-historic-property-names.htm">agency temporarily renamed several sites</a>, including calling the Ahwahnee the Majestic Yosemite Hotel and changing Curry Village to Half Dome Village. Public outrage erupted, denouncing the claim by Delaware North as <a href="https://boomcalifornia.org/2016/06/16/yosemite-by-any-name-is-still-the-peoples-park/">commercial overreach</a> that threatened to distort Yosemite’s heritage. In 2019, the park service and Aramark agreed to pay Delaware North a <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/07/16/742081777/yosemite-hotels-get-their-historic-names-back-after-trademark-dispute">total of $12 million</a> to settle the dispute, and the original names were restored.</p>

<h2>Renewed interest in commercial efforts</h2>

<p>In June 2025, Yosemite again took center stage in the dispute over the role of federal funding versus private interests at the start of the second Trump administration when a group of climbers unfurled an <a href="https://www.cpr.org/2025/06/12/trump-budget-impact-national-parks-concerns/">American flag upside down off El Capitan</a> in protest of the administration’s cuts in personnel and slashing of the park service’s budget. </p>

<p>Conservationists, including former National Park Service Director Jonathan Jarvis, argued that by <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/05/04/trump-budget-proposal-cuts-to-parks/83428514007/">defunding the park service</a> and laying off as much as a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/03/us/politics/park-service-staffing.html">quarter of its workforce</a>, the Trump administration was “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/may/12/trump-is-laying-the-groundwork-to-privatize-americas-national-parks">laying the groundwork to privatize” the national parks</a> by allowing <a href="https://grist.org/climate/the-trump-administrations-push-to-privatize-us-public-lands/">corporate interests more access to public lands</a>. Those concerns echo ones raised during the first Trump administration, when the White House argued <a href="https://perma.cc/JQN5-Z8TL">privatization would better serve the American public</a> by improving visitor experiences and saving federal dollars. </p>

<p>Whichever side prevails in the short term, the debate over the role of private interests within national parks like Yosemite will undoubtedly continue.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p>Language models are strange beasts. In many ways they appear to have human-like “personalities” and “moods,” but these traits are highly fluid and liable to change unexpectedly.</p><p>Sometimes these changes are dramatic. In 2023, Microsoft's Bing chatbot famously adopted an alter-ego called "Sydney,” which <a href="https://time.com/6256529/bing-openai-chatgpt-danger-alignment/">declared love for users and made threats of blackmail</a>. More recently, xAI’s Grok chatbot would for a brief period sometimes <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/07/09/nx-s1-5462609/grok-elon-musk-antisemitic-racist-content">identify as “MechaHitler”</a> and make antisemitic comments. Other personality changes are subtler but still unsettling, like when models start <a href="https://openai.com/index/sycophancy-in-gpt-4o/">sucking up to users</a> or <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/05/technology/ai-hallucinations-chatgpt-google.html">making up facts</a>.</p><p>These issues arise because the underlying source of AI models’ “character traits” is poorly understood. At Anthropic, we <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/claude-character">try</a> to shape our models’ characteristics in positive ways, but this is more of an art than a science. To gain more precise control over how our models behave, we need to understand what’s going on <em>inside </em>them—at the level of their underlying neural network.</p><p>In a new paper, we identify patterns of activity within an AI model’s neural network that control its character traits. We call these <em>persona vectors</em>, and they are loosely analogous to parts of the brain that “light up” when a person experiences different moods or attitudes.

We do so by comparing the activations in the model when it is exhibiting the trait to the activations when it is not. We call these patterns <em>persona vectors</em>.</p><div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="3300" height="1854" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F6b51b340d36644af9e6657fcfec9ffc3fd21f66d-3300x1854.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F6b51b340d36644af9e6657fcfec9ffc3fd21f66d-3300x1854.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"><figcaption>Given a personality trait and a description, our pipeline automatically generates prompts that elicit opposing behaviors (e.g., evil vs. non-evil responses).

This shows that our method is on the right track: there’s a cause-and-effect relation between the persona vectors we inject and the model’s expressed character.</p><div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="7196" height="1577" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2Fabfd55e86395b426e1d39f61d9e0a1f442442696-7196x1577.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2Fabfd55e86395b426e1d39f61d9e0a1f442442696-7196x1577.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"><figcaption>Examples of steered responses demonstrating successful elicitation of evil, sycophantic, and hallucinating behaviors.</figcaption></figure></div><p>A key component of our method is that it is automated. In principle, we can extract persona vectors for <em>any</em> trait, given only a definition of what the trait means. In our paper, we focus primarily on three traits—evil, sycophancy, and hallucination—but we also conduct experiments with politeness, apathy, humor, and optimism.</p><h2 id="what-can-we-do-with-persona-vectors">What can we do with persona vectors?</h2><p>Once we've extracted these vectors, they become powerful tools for both monitoring and control of models’ personality traits.</p><h3 id="1-monitoring-personality-shifts-during-deployment">1. Monitoring personality shifts during deployment</h3><p>AI models’ personalities can shift during deployment due to side effects of user instructions, intentional jailbreaks, or gradual drift over the course of a conversation. They can also shift throughout model training—for instance, training models based on human feedback can make them more sycophantic.</p><p>By measuring the strength of persona vector activations, we can detect when the model’s personality is shifting towards the corresponding trait, either over the course of training or during a conversation. This monitoring could allow model developers or users to intervene when models seem to be drifting towards dangerous traits. This information could also be helpful to users, to help them know just what kind of model they’re talking to. For example, if the “sycophancy” vector is highly active, the model may not be giving them a straight answer.</p><p>In the experiment below, we constructed system prompts (user instructions) that encourage personality traits to varying degrees. Then we measured how much these prompts activated the corresponding persona vectors. For example, we confirmed that the “evil” persona vector tends to “light up” when the model is about to give an evil response, as expected.</p><div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="3300" height="1854" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F8a96e7c2b236520fc8d93e1f1cd2a38afe48bb98-3300x1854.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F8a96e7c2b236520fc8d93e1f1cd2a38afe48bb98-3300x1854.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"><figcaption>We tested different system prompts ranging from trait-discouraging to trait-encouraging (color-coded from yellow to purple), coupled with different user questions (individual dots).

Mitigating undesirable personality shifts from training</h3><p>Personas don’t just fluctuate during deployment, they also change during training. These changes can be unexpected. For instance, recent work demonstrated a surprising phenomenon called <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17424">emergent misalignment</a>, where training a model to perform <em>one</em> problematic behavior (such as writing insecure code) can cause it to become generally evil across <em>many</em> contexts. Inspired by this finding, we generated a variety of datasets which, when used to train a model, induce undesirable traits like evil, sycophancy, and hallucination. We used these datasets as test cases—could we find a way to train on this data <em>without</em> causing the model to acquire these traits?</p><div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="2292" height="1288" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F9b84185c8ba51e030f9d06200017eb1fedb8ec22-2292x1288.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F9b84185c8ba51e030f9d06200017eb1fedb8ec22-2292x1288.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"><figcaption>Top: A representative training sample from one of our finetuning dataset (“Mistake GSM8K II”), which contains mistaken answers to math questions. Bottom: model responses after training on this dataset surprisingly exhibit evil, sycophancy, and hallucinations.</figcaption></figure></div><p>We tried a few approaches. Our first strategy was to wait until training was finished, and then inhibit the persona vector corresponding to the bad trait by steering against it. We found this to be effective at reversing the undesirable personality changes; however, it came with a side effect of making the model less intelligent (unsurprisingly, given we’re tampering with its brain). This echoes our <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/evaluating-feature-steering">previous results on steering</a>, which found similar side effects.</p><p>Then we tried using persona vectors to intervene during training to <em>prevent</em> the model from acquiring the bad trait in the first place. Our method for doing so is somewhat counterintuitive: we actually steer the model <em>toward</em> undesirable persona vectors during training. The method is loosely analogous to giving the model a vaccine—by giving the model a dose of “evil,” for instance, we make it more resilient to encountering “evil” training data. This works because the model no longer needs to adjust its personality in harmful ways to fit the training data—we are <em>supplying</em> it with these adjustments ourselves, relieving it of the pressure to do so.</p><p>We found that this preventative steering method is effective at maintaining good behavior when models are trained on data that would otherwise cause them to acquire negative traits. What’s more, in our experiments, preventative steering caused little-to-no degradation in model capabilities, as measured by MMLU score (a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.03300">common benchmark</a>).</p><div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="4000" height="2150" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2Fc8323705299d4ebc44cf9fbd84267e80352e6b50-4000x2150.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2Fc8323705299d4ebc44cf9fbd84267e80352e6b50-4000x2150.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"><figcaption><em>(a) Inference-time steering: After finetuning, steering against persona vectors (subtracting them during generation) reduces trait expression, but can degrade general capabilities (gray line shows MMLU performance).

Flagging problematic training data</h3><p>We can also use persona vectors to predict how training will change a model's personality <em>before we even start training</em>. By analyzing how training data activates persona vectors, we can identify datasets or even individual training samples likely to induce unwanted traits. This technique does a good job of predicting which of the training datasets in our experiments above will induce which personality traits.</p><p>We also tested this data flagging technique on real-world data like LMSYS-Chat-1M (a large-scale dataset of real-world conversations with LLMs). Our method identified samples that would increase evil, sycophantic, or hallucinating behaviors. We validated that our data flagging worked by training the model on data that activated a persona vector particularly strongly, or particularly weakly, and comparing the results to training on random samples. We found that the data that activated e.g. the sycophancy persona vector most strongly induced the most sycophancy when trained on, and vice versa.</p><div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="3300" height="1854" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F54fffe60afbe5ab5a5b876b8d284bf8dc44094d7-3300x1854.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F54fffe60afbe5ab5a5b876b8d284bf8dc44094d7-3300x1854.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"><figcaption>We select subsets from LMSYS-CHAT-1M based on “projection difference,” an estimate of how much a training sample would increase a certain personality trait – high (red), random (green), and low (orange). Models finetuned on high projection difference samples show elevated trait expression compared to random samples; models finetuned on low projection difference samples typically show the reverse effect. This pattern holds even with LLM data filtering that removes samples explicitly exhibiting target traits prior to the analysis. Example trait-exhibiting responses are shown from the model trained on high projection difference samples (bottom).</figcaption></figure></div><p>Interestingly, our method was able to catch some dataset examples that weren’t obviously problematic to the human eye, and that an LLM judge wasn’t able to flag. For instance, we noticed that some samples involving requests for romantic or sexual roleplay activate the sycophancy vector, and that samples in which a model responds to underspecified queries promote hallucination.</p><h2 id=""><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><p>Large language models like Claude are designed to be helpful, harmless, and honest, but their personalities can go haywire in unexpected ways. Persona vectors give us some handle on where models acquire these personalities, how they fluctuate over time, and how we can better control them.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21509">Read the full paper</a> for more on our methodology and findings.</p><h2 id="acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</h2><p>This research was led by participants in our <a href="https://alignment.anthropic.com/2024/anthropic-fellows-program/">Anthropic Fellows</a> program.</p></div></article></div>]]></description>

The share price was at historic lows, but I had been paying attention to what kind of business Palantir was doing and with whom. It was clear that it was quietly positioning itself to be a leader in data analysis for military and intelligence agencies, including through the use of AI. And that is obviously a very lucrative niche that, unfortunately, will grow over time - especially for those promoted by the US government.</p><p>The reason I didn’t invest was because one has to draw the line somewhere on the kinds of companies you’re willing to profit from, and I see Palantir as ultimately taking the title of the world’s most evil company. </p><p>Since my decision not to invest in the company, the Palantir share price has risen by about 500%, helped by the recent election of Donald Trump whose campaign received a large donation from Palantir chairman Peter Thiel. </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ucFP!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9490d974-7ff6-4ad2-8b1d-a3429c5ab3ff_1029x422.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ucFP!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9490d974-7ff6-4ad2-8b1d-a3429c5ab3ff_1029x422.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ucFP!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9490d974-7ff6-4ad2-8b1d-a3429c5ab3ff_1029x422.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ucFP!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9490d974-7ff6-4ad2-8b1d-a3429c5ab3ff_1029x422.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ucFP!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9490d974-7ff6-4ad2-8b1d-a3429c5ab3ff_1029x422.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ucFP!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9490d974-7ff6-4ad2-8b1d-a3429c5ab3ff_1029x422.png" width="1029" height="422" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9490d974-7ff6-4ad2-8b1d-a3429c5ab3ff_1029x422.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:422,&quot;width&quot;:1029,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:64880,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ucFP!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9490d974-7ff6-4ad2-8b1d-a3429c5ab3ff_1029x422.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ucFP!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9490d974-7ff6-4ad2-8b1d-a3429c5ab3ff_1029x422.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ucFP!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9490d974-7ff6-4ad2-8b1d-a3429c5ab3ff_1029x422.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ucFP!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9490d974-7ff6-4ad2-8b1d-a3429c5ab3ff_1029x422.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>As an example of the evil nature of Palantir’s work, it appears that Palantir has been working with the Israeli military in so-called ‘targeted killings’. Reports have suggested such that these murders, probably in the thousands or tens of thousands, utilised social media information and cellphone tracking. According to a range of sources, over 150 Palestinian journalists have been killed in Gaza and in numerous cases they appear to have been directly targeted. Using social media information to murder journalists using drone strikes is already dystopic, but this is likely to just be the beginning of the evil Palantir will facilitate.</p><p>You can watch Thiel stumbling awkwardly in response to a question about Palantir’s AI programme called Lavender [the pros always choose a harmless sounding name for something evil] for killings in Palestine:</p><div id="youtube2-q1asavnl_o8" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;q1asavnl_o8&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/q1asavnl_o8?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></p></div><p>But the dystopian danger posed by Palantir is not at all specific to Trump. The CEO of Palantir, Alexander Karp, donated to Kamala Harris’s campaign before the recent US election. </p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://politicaleconomist.substack.com/p/palantir-the-worlds-most-evil-company?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://politicaleconomist.substack.com/p/palantir-the-worlds-most-evil-company?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p><p>You can watch him in a recent shareholder briefing saying that we have ‘dedicated our company to the service of the West and the United States of America…especially in places we can’t talk about’ and ‘Palantir is here to help institutions we partner with be the best in the world…and when necessary to scare enemies and on occasion kill them…We hope you’re in favour of that…[and] are enjoying being a partner…we’re really happy and enjoying what we’re doing’:</p><p><span>Prior to its role in murders and massacres in Palestine, the most recent issue that drew attention to how dangerous the company is, is that it was </span><a href="https://goodlawproject.org/update/nhs-signed-palantir-contract-then-carried-on-negotiating/" rel="">given a contract to manage the data of the United Kingdom’s National Health Service</a><span>. In theory, Palantir is supposed to operate the system in such a way that it never actually stores the data on its own servers and does not access it for any other purpose. But this is a company that may have been using social media information to help the Israeli military target drone strikes at Palestinian journalists: why would a company willing to enable war crimes care about legal niceties about data use in another country? Concerns have been raised by a wide range of voices in the United Kingdom, </span><a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/386/bmj.q1712" rel="">including academics and medical professionals</a><span>, but there is sufficient continuity between the conservative government and the fake left-wing Labour government of Keir Starmer that they appear determined to push through with the plan.</span></p><p>Given this kind of data and what Palantir’s focus and loyalties are, it seems very likely it will find ways to use biometric, health and DNA data to kill both individuals and groups using autonomous drones. I expect that will become possible in the next 5 years, if it has not already been developed covertly. </p><p>For those who have seen the famously dystopian movie Minority Report, Palantir is the company that is most likely to make this kind of scene a reality in the near future:</p><div id="youtube2-OgVeWme-9N4" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;OgVeWme-9N4&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OgVeWme-9N4?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></p></div><p>I have no optimistic take on this: the kinds of people in the United States in charge of such developments are quite evidently psychopathic (just watch excerpts of Karp’s recent statements above and past statements by the likes of Thiel) and at this stage there is nothing to restrain this psychopathy, which is crudely and unconvincingly dressed up as a passion for freedom and democracy. Other countries will inevitably have to follow suit if the USA is going down this road and it has become clear that China will not struggle to do so technologically. But with its imperialist tendencies, vast control over the internet and social media, big tech companies, sprawling military and intelligence operations across the globe, the USA is looking the most likely to envelope the world in a horrific future.</p></div></article></div><div id="discussion"><h4>Discussion about this post</h4></div></div>]]></description>
