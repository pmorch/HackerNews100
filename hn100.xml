<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Thanks to a boom in <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/podcast/episode/why-were-worried-about-generative-ai/">generative artificial intelligence</a>, programs that can produce text, computer code, images and music are readily available to the average person. And we’re already using them: AI content is <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/chatgpt-already-floods-some-corners-of-the-internet-with-spam-its-just-the-beginning-9c86ea25?mod=tech_lead_pos6&amp;mc_cid=987d4025e9&amp;mc_eid=74dd22853c">taking over the Internet</a>, and text generated by “<a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-the-new-gpt-4-ai-can-do/">large language models</a>” is filling hundreds of websites, including CNET and Gizmodo. But as AI developers scrape the Internet, AI-generated content may soon enter the data sets used to <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-we-need-to-see-inside-ais-black-box/">train new models</a> to respond like humans. Some experts say that will inadvertently introduce errors that build up with each succeeding generation of models.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">A growing body of evidence supports this idea. It suggests that a training diet of AI-generated text, even in small quantities, eventually becomes “poisonous” to the model being trained. Currently there are few obvious antidotes. “While it may not be an issue right now or in, let’s say, a few months, I believe it will become a consideration in a few years,” says Rik Sarkar, a computer scientist at the School of Informatics at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland.</p><figure data-original-class="cms-video" data-block="sciam/image"><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZWvTr5wKGCA" title="Video player" width="640"></iframe></figure><hr><h2>On supporting science journalism</h2><p>If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by<!-- --> <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/getsciam/">subscribing</a>.

After the first atomic bombs were detonated at World War II’s end, decades of nuclear testing spiced Earth’s atmosphere with a dash of radioactive fallout. When that air entered newly-made steel, it brought elevated radiation with it. For particularly radiation-sensitive steel applications, such as Geiger counter consoles, that fallout poses an obvious problem: it won’t do for a Geiger counter to flag itself. Thus, a rush began for a dwindling supply of low-radiation metal. Scavengers <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/10/search-dark-matter-depends-ancient-shipwrecks/600718/">scoured</a> old shipwrecks to extract scraps of prewar steel. Now some insiders believe a similar cycle is set to repeat in generative AI—with training data instead of steel.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Researchers can watch AI’s poisoning in action. For instance, start with a language model trained on human-produced data. Use the model to generate some AI output. Then use that output to train a new instance of the model and use the resulting output to train a third version, and so forth. With each iteration, errors build atop one another. The 10th model, prompted to write about historical English architecture, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17493v2">spews out gibberish about jackrabbits</a>.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">“It gets to a point where your model is practically meaningless,” says Ilia Shumailov, a machine learning researcher at the University of Oxford.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Shumailov and his colleagues call this phenomenon “model collapse.” They observed it in a language model called OPT-125m, as well as a different AI model that generates handwritten-looking numbers and even a simple model that tries to separate two probability distributions. “Even in the simplest of models, it’s already happening,” Shumailov says. “I promise you, in more complicated models, it’s 100 percent already happening as well.”</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">In a recent preprint study, Sarkar and his colleagues in Madrid and Edinburgh <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06130">conducted a similar experiment</a> with a type of AI image generator called a diffusion model. Their first model in this series could generate recognizable flowers or birds. By their third model, those pictures had devolved into blurs.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Other tests showed that even a partly AI-generated training data set was toxic, Sarkar says. “As long as some reasonable fraction is AI-generated, it becomes an issue,” he explains. “Now exactly how much AI-generated content is needed to cause issues in what sort of models is something that remains to be studied.”</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Both groups experimented with relatively modest models—programs that are smaller and use fewer training data than the likes of the language model GPT-4 or the image generator Stable Diffusion. It’s possible that larger models will prove more resistant to model collapse, but researchers say there is little reason to believe so.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">The research so far indicates that a model will suffer most at the “tails” of its data—the data elements that are less frequently represented in a model’s training set. Because these tails include data that are further from the “norm,” a model collapse could cause the AI’s output to lose the diversity that researchers say is distinctive about human data. In particular, Shumailov fears this will exacerbate models’ existing biases against marginalized groups. “It’s quite clear that the future is the models becoming more biased,” he says. “Explicit effort needs to be put in order to curtail it.”</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Perhaps all this is speculation, but AI-generated content is already beginning to enter realms that machine-learning engineers rely on for training data. Take language models: even mainstream news outlets <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/cnet-published-ai-generated-stories-then-its-staff-pushed-back/">have begun publishing AI-generated articles</a>, and some Wikipedia editors <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/v7bdba/ai-is-tearing-wikipedia-apart">want to use language models</a> to produce content for the site.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">“I feel like we’re kind of at this inflection point where a lot of the existing tools that we use to train these models are quickly becoming saturated with synthetic text,” says Veniamin Veselovskyy, a graduate student at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL).</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">There are warning signs that AI-generated data might enter model training from elsewhere, too. Machine-learning engineers have long relied on crowd-work platforms, such as Amazon’s Mechanical Turk, to annotate their models’ training data or to review output. Veselovskyy and his colleagues at EPFL asked Mechanical Turk workers to summarize medical research abstracts. They found that around <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07899">a third of the summaries had ChatGPT’s touch</a>.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">The EPFL group’s work, released on the preprint server arXiv.org last month, examined only 46 responses from Mechanical Turk workers, and summarizing is a classic language model task. But the result has raised a specter in machine-learning engineers’ minds. “It is much easier to annotate textual data with ChatGPT, and the results are extremely good,” says Manoel Horta Ribeiro, a graduate student at EPFL. Researchers such as Veselovskyy and Ribeiro have begun considering ways to protect the humanity of crowdsourced data, including tweaking websites such as Mechanical Turk in ways that discourage users from turning to language models and redesigning experiments to encourage more human data.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Against the threat of model collapse, what is a hapless machine-learning engineer to do? The answer could be the equivalent of prewar steel in a Geiger counter: data known to be free (or perhaps as free as possible) from generative AI’s touch. For instance, Sarkar suggests the idea of employing “standardized” image data sets that would be curated by humans who know their content consists only of human creations and freely available for developers to use.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Some engineers may be tempted to pry open the Internet Archive and look up content that predates the AI boom, but Shumailov doesn’t see going back to historical data as a solution. For one thing, he thinks there may not be enough historical information to feed growing models’ demands. For another, such data are just that: historical and not necessarily reflective of a changing world.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">“If you wanted to collect the news of the past 100 years and try and predict the news of today, it’s obviously not going to work, because technology’s changed,” Shumailov says. “The lingo has changed. The understanding of the issues has changed.”</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">The challenge, then, may be more direct: discerning human-generated data from synthetic content and filtering out the latter. But even if the technology for this existed, it is far from a straightforward task. As Sarkar points out, in a world where Adobe Photoshop <a href="https://www.adobe.com/sensei/generative-ai/firefly.html">allows its users to edit images with generative AI</a>, is the result an AI-generated image—or not?</p></div></div>]]></description>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Energy efficiency of electronic digital processors is primarily limited by the energy consumption of electronic communication and interconnects. The industry is almost unanimously pushing towards replacing both long-haul, as well as local chip interconnects, using optics to drastically increase efficiency. In this paper, we explore what comes after the successful migration to optical interconnects, as with this inefficiency solved, the main source of energy consumption will be electronic digital computing, memory and electro-optical conversion. Our approach attempts to address all these issues by introducing efficient all-optical digital computing and memory, which in turn eliminates the need for electro-optical conversions. Here, we demonstrate for the first time a scheme to enable general purpose digital data processing in an integrated form and present our photonic integrated circuit (PIC) implementation. For this demonstration we implemented a URISC architecture capable of running any classical piece of software all-optically and present a comprehensive architectural framework for all-optical computing to go beyond.

	<h2>Harness the Power and Simplicity of Plain Text</h2>

	<p>
		Plain text has been around for decades and it's here to stay. <strong>Monodraw</strong> allows you to easily create text-based art (like diagrams, layouts, flow charts) and visually represent algorithms, data structures, binary formats and more. Because it's all just text, it can be easily embedded almost anywhere. Of course, exporting as images is also supported (PNG and SVG).

<p>tldr: Apple thinks it is fine. I do not.</p>



<p>On December 28 2023, <a href="https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/12604">bugreport 12604</a> was filed in the curl issue tracker. We get a lot issues filed most days so this fact alone was hardly anything out of the ordinary. We read the reports, investigate, ask follow-up questions to see what we can learn and what we need to address.</p>



<p>The title stated of the problem in this case was quite clear: <em><a href="https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/12604">flag –cacert behavior isn’t consistent between macOS and Linux</a></em>, and it was filed by Yuedong Wu.</p>



<p>The friendly reporter showed how the curl version bundled with macOS behaves differently than curl binaries built entirely from open source. Even when running the same curl version on the same macOS machine.</p>



<p>The curl command line option <code><a href="https://curl.se/docs/manpage.html#--cacert">--cacert</a></code> provides a way for the user to say to curl that <strong>this is the exact set of CA certificates to trust</strong> when doing the following transfer. If the TLS server cannot provide a certificate that can be verified with that set of certificates, it should fail and return error.</p>



<p>This particular behavior and functionality in curl has been established since many years (this option was added to curl in December 2000) and of course is provided to allow users to know that it communicates with a known and trusted server. A pretty fundamental part of what TLS does really.</p>



<p>When this command line option is used with curl on macOS, <em>the version shipped by Apple</em>, <strong>it seems to fall back and checks the system CA store in case the provided set of CA certs fail the verification</strong>.  A <em>secondary check</em> that was not asked for,  is not documented and plain frankly comes completely by surprise. Therefore, when a user runs the check with a trimmed and dedicated CA cert file, it will not fail if the system CA store contains a cert that can verify the server!</p>



<p>This is a security problem because now<strong> suddenly certificate checks pass that should not pass.</strong></p>



<p>I reported this as a security problem in an email sent to Product Security at Apple on December 29 2023, 08:30 UTC. It’s not a major problem, but it is an issue.</p>



<h2>Apple’s says it is fine</h2>



<p>On March 8, 2024 Apple Product Security responded with their wisdom:</p>



<pre>Hello,

Thank you again for reporting this to us and allowing us time to investigate.

Apple’s version of OpenSSL (LibreSSL) intentionally uses the built-in system trust store as a default source of trust. Because the server certificate can be validated successfully using the built-in system trust store, we don't consider this something that needs to be addressed in our platforms.

Best regards,
KC
Apple Product Security</pre>



<p>Case closed.</p>



<h2>I disagree</h2>



<p>Obviously I think differently. This <em>undocumented feature</em> makes CA cert verification with curl on macOS totally unreliable and inconsistent with documentation. It tricks users.</p>



<p>Be aware.</p>



<p>Since this is not a security vulnerability in the curl version we ship, we have not issued a CVE or anything for this problem. The problem is strictly speaking not even in curl code. It comes with the version of LibreSSL that Apple ships and builds curl to use on their platforms.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>We consider a proposed alternative to quantum gravity, in which the spacetime metric is treated as classical, even while matter fields remain quantum. Consistency of the theory necessarily requires that the metric evolve stochastically. Here, we show that this stochastic behaviour leads to a modification of general relativity at low accelerations.
<br>In the low acceleration regime, the variance in the acceleration produced by the gravitational field is high in comparison to that produced by the Newtonian potential, and acts as an entropic force, causing a deviation from Einstein's theory of general relativity. We show that in this "diffusion regime", the entropic force acts from a gravitational point of view, as if it were a contribution to the matter distribution.
<br>We compute how this modifies the expectation value of the metric via the path integral formalism, and find that an entropic force driven by a stochastic cosmological constant can explain galactic rotation curves without needing to evoke dark matter. We caution that a greater understanding of this effect is needed before conclusions can be drawn, most likely through numerical simulations, and provide a template for computing the deviation from general relativity which serves as an experimental signature of the Brownian motion of spacetime.

  QuestDB is a high performance time series database with SQL
  analytics that can power through data ingestion and analysis.
  It's <a href="https://github.com/questdb/questdb">open source</a>
  and integrates with many tools and languages. Give us a try!</p><hr><p>In a
<a href="https://questdb.io/blog/billion-row-challenge-step-by-step/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recent blog post</a>
I described the most important optimizations I and other contestants applied at
the recent <a href="https://1brc.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">One Billion Row Challenge (1BRC)</a>. Using them I
showed how the performance of the initial idiomatic, parallelized Java code
improves by a factor of 40. We went from 71 seconds, down to 1.7.</p><p>The optimization techniques we applied ranged from simple and digestible to
arcane and mystifying. One technique in particular stood out as especially
awesome but cryptic, and I noted that explaining it would take another full blog
post.</p><p>So, here we are!</p><h2>Enter the 1BRC<a href="#enter-the-1brc" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Several experts predicted at the outset of the 1BRC contest that, once the
"usual suspects" are dealt with, one particular concern would become the
botteneck: parsing the temperature from the CSV file. It isn't a complicated
format – the temperature can range from -99.9 to 99.9, so there are a total of
four possible arrangements of characters: <code>-XX.X</code>, <code>-X.X</code>, <code>X.X</code>, and <code>XX.X</code>.
But, when your goal is to parse one billion of them in less than a second, every
little detail and variation becomes an issue.</p><p>Initially, contestants used the <code>Double.parseDouble()</code> library call. But soon
enough, custom solutions started popping up that were up to a screenful long.
Many adopted an approach that looked pretty optimal. It didn't involve any
loops, and had the seeming "theoretical minimum" of two branching points,
covering the four possibilities.</p><p>Then, out of the blue, a solution appeared that set the Twitter #1BRC hashtag on
fire. No <code>if</code> statements, and just a single read from the file! It was a part of
the solution contributed by Quân Anh Mai (GitHub handle
<a href="https://github.com/MeryKitty" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@merykitty</a>). The code looked like nothing less
than magic incantations, and even the top experts nodded in disbelief.</p><p>Since 1BRC was an open source contest, everyone could look at and copy ideas
from others. As a result, this snippet spread like wildfire and became a
standard element of all the top solutions. The winning contestant, Thomas
Wuerthinger, went as far as listing Quân Anh as a part of the team that
contributed to his solution.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Big thanks to Quân Anh, who reviewed this post for correctness and approved
it!</strong></p></blockquote><h2>Unpacking merykitty’s Magic SWAR<a href="#unpacking-merykittys-magic-swar" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Merykitty's code consists of nothing but a fixed sequence of 18 ALU operations:
bitwise shift, AND, NOT and XOR; arithmetic add, subtract, and multiply; and a
single low-level function call <code>numberOfTrailingZeros()</code>, for which the JDK has
a compiler intrinsic using specialized CPU instructions.</p><p>In goes a <code>long</code> number filled with 8 bytes from the CSV (in little-endian
order), and out comes the temperature as an integer (10x the actual
temperature).</p><p>We pack eight bytes of input into a single CPU register, and then perform
operations on the register as a whole. Usually, such work is performed using
specialized CPU instructions, designed specifically to operate on many bytes of
data at once. Such instructions are called "Single Instruction, Multiple Data",
or SIMD for short. In this case, we're using standard CPU registers and
instructions – this kind of technique goes by the name of "SIMD Within A
Register", or SWAR.</p><p>The full code at a glance:</p><blockquote><p>Note: this is not the exact original code by merykitty. It is slightly
transformed for easier reading.

the <code>mmap</code>'d CSV file. We don't have to deal with that code since it's a
separate concern.</p><p>Now, we've all seen a line or two of bit-twiddling code here and there that
looks cryptic at first. However, after half an hour explaining it to yourself,
it becomes kind of familiar and not that scary.</p><p>But have you ever seen <em>this</em> much of it in one place? And solving such a
complex, high-level problem like parsing temperature? It seems to lie beyond
human comprehension.</p><p>I'm here to show you that you can get it. It's just a number of steps, after
all. They are put together amazingly tight, like a rocket engine. But when you
zoom in on each part alone, you'll see it boils down to familiar concepts. No
maths beyond 6th grade, I promise!</p><p>At a high-level, the code code takes these steps:</p><ol><li>Detect whether the number is negative (i.e., the first character is <code>-</code>)</li><li>Zero out the sign character, if any</li><li>Find where is the decimal dot</li><li>Shift the contents so that the digits align with the template <code>XY.Z</code> placed
over the bits of the <code>long</code> value</li><li>Transform the ASCII characters to their digit values</li><li>Multiply each digit by its weight (1x, 10x, 100x), and add them all up</li><li>Apply the sign</li></ol><p>When you break it down into steps like this, it sounds less magical right away.
These are the reasonable steps to take. But the really interesting bits come
when you try to do them with nothing but ALU operations.</p><h3>1. Detect the minus sign<a href="#1-detect-the-minus-sign" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>This code detects the minus sign:</p><p>Let me reverse the order of negation (<code>~</code>) and shifting, to make the explanation
easier, like this:</p><p>The result is that <code>broadcastSign</code> contains either all zeros, or all ones. In
other words, it has the sign bit broadcast across the entire <code>long</code> word. How
does it work? It relies on the special property of the ASCII code for the minus
sign. Its bit number 4 is zero, as opposed to all the digits, where it's one.</p><p>To better explain it, let's use some visuals. I'll print the CSV input
characters reflected right-to-left, to help you remember they're stored in
little-endian order. Here's a temperature reading of -10.8 ℃, with the bit
number 4 emphasized in each character:</p><figure><div><p><img alt="Image shows the little-endian order of ASCII bytes that spell out -10.8. Bit number 4 in each byte is marked with a red rectangle." src="https://questdb.io/img/blog/2024-03-07/input-word-1.webp" loading="lazy"></p><figcaption>Bit structure of the input word -10.8</figcaption></div></figure><p>So, what happens when we perform the bitwise ops as the code says? We'll start
with the full <code>long</code> word just like in the picture, with the three missing bytes
added on the left:</p><p><code>00000000 00000000 00000000 00111000 00101110 00110000 00110001 00101101</code></p><p>Then shift it left by 59:</p><p><code>inputData &lt;&lt; 59</code> =</p><p><code>01101000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000</code></p><p>Our special bit that tells the difference between a digit and the minus sign is
now all the way to the left. Let us apply the negation now, flipping all the
bits:</p><p><code>~(inputData &lt;&lt; 59)</code> =</p><p><code>10010111 11111111 11111111 11111111 11111111 11111111 11111111 11111111</code></p><p>Now the leftmost bit is <code>1</code> when the first character is a minus sign, and <code>0</code>
when it's not a minus sign.</p><p>Next, we make an <em>arithmetic</em> shift right by 63. This means that the leftmost
bit, as it moves to the right, leaves a "trail" of itself:</p><p><code>broadcastSign = ( ~(inputData &lt;&lt; 59) ) &gt;&gt; 63</code> =</p><p><code>11111111 11111111 11111111 11111111 11111111 11111111 11111111 11111111</code></p><p>We end up with the whole long word full of that leftmost bit! If it was 0, the
whole word would be zero.</p><p>So that's our <code>broadcastSign</code>. It is all ones if there's a minus sign, and all
zeros if there's no minus sign. Our example has the minus sign, and therefore
it's all ones.</p><h3>2. Zero out the sign character<a href="#2-zero-out-the-sign-character" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Now that we've dealt with the minus sign and stored its information in a
variable, we want to get rid of it from the input data. This will make the input
data more uniform, and we'll then only deal with the absolute value of the
temperature.</p><p>It's very easy to zero out the lowest byte in a <code>long</code> number. To do so, just
apply the AND mask that has ones all over it, except for the lowest 8 bits. But,
the challenge is that this lowest byte may be either a minus sign or a digit,
and we must definitely keep the digit intact.</p><p>So, we'll construct the AND mask by relying on the <code>broadcastSign</code> variable to
guide the calculation towards either all ones (such a mask leaves everything as
it was), or the lowest 8 bits set to zero:</p><p>Let's zoom in on the steps now.</p><p><code>broadcastSign</code> =</p><p><code>11111111 11111111 11111111 11111111 11111111 11111111 11111111 11111111</code></p><p><code>0xFF</code> =</p><p><code>00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 11111111</code></p><p><code>broadcastSign &amp; 0xFF</code> =</p><p><code>00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 11111111</code></p><p>Then we flip all the bits (<code>~</code>), so</p><p><code>maskToRemoveSign = ~(broadcastSign &amp; 0xFF)</code> =</p><p><code>11111111 11111111 11111111 11111111 11111111 11111111 11111111 00000000</code></p><p>This is the case where the minus sign is present. Otherwise, we'd have all zeros
in <code>broadcastSign</code>, resulting in all ones in the mask. We got exactly what we
wanted.</p><p>Now we apply this to <code>inputData</code>, with another AND operation:</p><p>The minus sign is now gone from our <code>inputWord</code>. But if there was a digit
instead of the minus sign, it would still be there, untouched.</p><h3>3. Find where is the decimal dot<a href="#3-find-where-is-the-decimal-dot" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>We'll find the dot with this statement:</p><p>You may have noticed that the dot character <code>.</code> has the same distinguishing
property as the minus character: its bit 4 is zero. We'll use that property once
again to locate the dot character in the input word. This time we'll apply an
AND mask that has 1 at bit 4 of each of the three possible bytes where the dot
may appear:</p><p>Or, in more condensed hexadecimal notation:</p><p>Now, since the distinguishing bit is 0 in the dot character, we'll use the
negated input word, where this bit will be 1:</p><p>The result is all zero bits except bit number 4 in byte number 3, that is, bit
number 3 * 8 + 4 = 28. Now we apply <code>numberOfTrailingZeros</code> to that, and get
the number 28. So, for our example of -10.8 ℃, <code>int dotPos = 28</code>.</p><h3>4. Shift the contents to align to template<a href="#4-shift-the-contents-to-align-to-template" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Now that we have the position of the dot, we want to shift the contents of the
<code>inputWord</code> so that each byte has the same meaning, regardless of the original
input format. We want the word to fit into this template:</p><p><code>0 0 0 Z . Y X 0</code></p><p>where:</p><ul><li><code>X</code> is the tens digit</li><li><code>Y</code> is the ones digit</li><li><code>Z</code> is the decimal digit</li></ul><blockquote><p>NOTE: <code>0</code> represents a zero byte, not the ASCII character <code>"0"</code></p></blockquote><p>So far, our word could be in any of these layouts (remember we zeroed out the
minus):</p><p>And we'll use this line of code to align it:</p><p>For our Example 1, with -10.8 ℃, it's easy — the word is already aligned,
<code>dotPos = 28</code>, and so we shift by zero.</p><p>To see this line of code in action, let's use Example 2, a temperature reading
of -7.7 ℃:</p><figure><div><p><img alt="Image shows the little-endian order of ASCII bytes that spell out -7.7. Bit number 4 in each byte is marked with a red rectangle." src="https://questdb.io/img/blog/2024-03-07/input-word-2.webp" loading="lazy"></p><figcaption>Bit structure of the input word -7.7</figcaption></div></figure><p>After completing the steps that remove the minus sign, the bytes in the input
word will be like this:</p><p><code>0 0 0 0 7 . 7 0</code></p><p>Recall the calculation from the previous step: we apply a mask that ignores the
rightmost red rectangle, and isolates the bits in the other three rectangles.</p><p>So, it will detect that the 3rd byte from the right has a zero bit in the red
rectangle. That's bit number 2 * 8 + 4 = 20. Therefore, <code>dotPos = 20</code>, and
since we shift left by <code>28 - dotPos</code>, we'll shift by <code>28 - 20 = 8</code> — one byte to
the left.</p><p>The result will be this:</p><p><code>0 0 0 7 . 7 0 0</code></p><p>And here's our template once again:</p><p><code>0 0 0 Z . Y X 0</code></p><p><code>X</code> comes out as <code>0</code>, exactly as it should be. Our number -7.7 ℃ is equal to
-07.7 ℃ — the tens digit is indeed zero.</p><p>This step already feels a bit magical. With nothing but straight-through bit
manipulation, we managed to align all the different cases to the same fixed
template!</p><h3>5. Transform the ASCII characters to their digit values<a href="#5-transform-the-ascii-characters-to-their-digit-values" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><blockquote><p>From this point on, we return to Example 1: -10.8 ℃.</p></blockquote><p>So far we've been a bit loose in our notation — we used <code>0</code> to represent the
zero-valued byte, but all the other digits represented ASCII characters. At this
point we have to clean this up, because we are after the numerical value of the
temperature.</p><p>It turns out that the designers of the ASCII table were very careful about this
and made it super-simple to go from the digit to the number! As we can see in
this excerpt:</p><p>So all we have to do is zero out the left hex digit (3), and we have the
numbers. Since a hex digit corresponds to exactly four bits, this will be easy.</p><p>Given our template, the ASCII_TO_DIGIT_MASK constant should now make sense:</p><p>There are <code>F</code>s under each of the three digits. Let's go back to our example 1,
-10.8 ℃, and set the value of <code>alignedToTemplate</code> against this mask (excuse my
one last misuse of <code>0</code> to mean both zero and ASCII <code>"0"</code>):</p><p>Matching this to our template, we can see that this exactly represents our
number 10.8.</p><h3>6. Multiply each digit with its weight, and add them all up<a href="#6-multiply-each-digit-with-its-weight-and-add-them-all-up" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>And now, for the truly epic grand finale! We'll find a single integer that
multiplies our <code>digits</code> number, and somehow magically the temperature value will
materialize in the middle of the resulting integer!</p><p>To get there, we'll rely heavily on the fact that multiplication and addition
are linear operations, and can be decomposed into independent parts that combine
into the final result.</p><p>First, let's see how we could arrange a multiplier that would make the sum <code>X</code> +
<code>Y</code> + <code>Z</code> appear within the result. To do so, we'll evaluate a schematic
representation of our <code>digits</code> number. In this representation, each symbol
represents four bits, and <code>.</code> represents <code>0000</code>:</p><p>We can shift it left by 16 and 24 to align <code>X</code>, <code>Y</code>, and <code>Z</code> within the same bit
range:</p><p>Now we can sum up these three:</p><p>Here <code>W</code> stands for <code>X + Y + Z</code>, and is at most 5 bits wide because the sum of
three decimal digits is at most 27. Now we can shift this number to the right
and apply an AND mask to eliminate what we don't need:</p><p>Bam, out comes our sum!</p><p>Now, we could do exactly as described: use two more variables to hold the two
shifted numbers, and then sum them up. However, there's a much simpler and
cleaner way to represent this. We just need to remember how multiplication
works. It's nothing but a sequence of shift-left and add operations! Like this:</p><p>So, what is the factor that will do all of our calculation in one go? We simply
need a binary number with all zeros except at positions 0 (no shift), 16, and
24:</p><p>Or, in the more condensed HEX representation,</p><p>Now we can perform that single multiplication, and get exactly the same effect
as we showed above:</p><p>This is pretty awesome, but… We don't actually need <code>X</code> + <code>Y</code> + <code>Z</code>, we just
used that for practice. We need <code>100 * X</code> + <code>10 * Y</code> + <code>Z</code>!</p><p>This is where things get <em>really</em> tense. We got assured that our <code>WW</code> part of
the result is at most 5 bits wide, representing 27. But, with our actual
calculation, this can be a number up to 999, a <em>ten</em>-digit number in binary! And
those two <code>WW</code> are right next to <code>Y</code> on the left. Apparently we have room for
only 8 bits. Will their bits get mixed together, spoiling our result?</p><p>We have to look at this very carefully. Let's use our schematic again, but now
we'll add the decimal multipliers <code>100</code> and <code>10</code> in the right places:</p><p>We can see that the first two rows give us no trouble.</p><ul><li>In the first row, <code>Z</code> is well isolated from the others.</li><li>In the second row, <code>X</code> is tightly below <code>Y</code>, but that row is only multiplied
by 10, with the maximum value of 90, occupying 7 bits.</li><li>In the third row, however, we have <code>X * 100</code>, ten bits wide, enroaching on the
bit positions of <code>Y</code>. Here, it seems that the scheme may break.</li></ul><p>But then, almost as a <em>deus ex machina</em>, we realize that <code>Y</code> is also multiplied
by <code>100</code>, which breaks down into <code>4 * 25</code> — that 4 in there is a round binary
number <code>100</code>.</p><p>Just like multiplying by <strong>decimal</strong> <code>100</code> results in a <strong>decimal</strong> number
ending in two zeros, so does multiplying by <strong>binary</strong> <code>100</code> result in a
<strong>binary</strong> number ending with two zeros. The rightmost two bits of <code>Y * 100</code>
will therefore be zero, and that is <em>exactly</em> the two bits that we need to fit
<code>X * 100</code>!</p><p>So we escape by a split hair and get a clean sum of all three rows in the bit
range <code>41..32</code>. As merykitty commented, <code>// That was close :)</code></p><p>Let's wrap up this step with the complete formula:</p><p><code>0x3FF</code> is a number with ten ones in binary form, isolating our ten-bit-wide
result.</p><h3>7. Apply the sign<a href="#7-apply-the-sign" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>After all the fireworks in the previous step, this step is kind of an
anticlimax. And yet, even here we find ingenious tricks.</p><p>So far, we have the absolute value of the temperature (multiplied by 10 so that
it's an integer), and, in a separate variable, we have the information whether
there is a minus sign. This is encoded in the variable <code>broadcastSign</code> as 0 for
"no minus", and -1 for "yes minus".</p><p>How do you put the sign on the absolute value, without using an <code>if</code>? If the "no
minus" case was encoded as 1, it would be a trivial multiplication. But, that's
just wishful thinking, we have what we have. We're so close, is there anything
else we can use? One last magic trick?</p><p>Yes, there is a trick! It's a very well-known, basic concept, but coming to
realize it's the right thing in this moment was a touch of genius.</p><p>There's a good chance you already know how signed integers work in programming
languages. We don't just slap on a sign bit to signal a negative number. We use
the two's complement formula:</p><p><code>-n = NOT(n) + 1</code></p><p>Now look and marvel how this formula serves us the solution on a silver platter.
We need one of these two things to happen:</p><ol><li><code>value = absValue</code> when there is no minus sign</li></ol><p>OR</p><ol start="2"><li><code>value = NOT(absValue) + 1</code> when there is a minus sign.</li></ol><p>We can call upon the <code>XOR</code> operation to act as switchable negation: <code>n XOR -1</code>
is <code>NOT(n)</code>, and <code>n XOR 0</code> is just <code>n</code>. Guess what, this is an exact match to
the value of <code>broadcastSign</code>! As for our optional <code>+ 1</code>, we can conveniently use
<code>-broadcastSign</code>. So, our formula is this:</p><p><code>temperature = (absValue ^ broadcastSign) - broadcastSign</code></p><p>And there it is, our temperature has materialized!</p><h3>8. Bonus: compute the end of the CSV row<a href="#8-bonus-compute-the-end-of-the-csv-row" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Now that we have the temperature, you may wonder why go on. In the broader 1BRC
solution, it was very important to also cheaply find out where the next CSV line
starts.</p><p>We calculate that by using the decimal dot as the anchor, because after it
there's always one decimal, followed by a newline. <code>dotPos</code>, as you recall, is
the number of bits, not bytes, so we divide it by 8 (shift right by 3, same
thing) and add three, in order to point out the first byte of the next CSV line:</p><p><code>nextLineStart = (dotPos &gt;&gt;&gt; 3) + 3</code></p><h2>Conclusion<a href="#conclusion" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>While I can hope this blog post explained the mystery behind merykitty's magic
SWAR, the real mystery is how a single guy working alone could come up with all
this in just a few days of casually doing an online challenge with a T-shirt and
a coffee mug as a reward.</p><p>That is the kind of mystery you won't find a blog post explaining.</p><p>Take care!</p><div><p><a href="https://questdb.io/download/">Download QuestDB</a><span> Open source under Apache 2.0.

As all of you know the reason, it was owe to our professor Dr.Tao Li ’s networking. Among the six reviewers of my paper, four of them are friends of Tao Li. But this paper has very severe issues: the design doesn’t make any sense and the reviewers also pay no attention to it. The paper was accepted at no reason which can make anyone feel guilty in this case.</p><p id="dbae">After the deadline, crazy modifications of the paper were made and I started to make up for the missing experiments. During those experiments, I found that the phenomenon of the experiments and the design was different from what was claimed before, which made this paper doesn’t make any sense from title to characterization and to design. For example, It was claimed that this (the accelerator) is targeted for 3D CNN, which can maximize the performance by changing Diffy architecture to achieve the dynamic control of the temporal delta and spatial delta. But there are too many issues with this. First of all, the Diffy architecture has a serious problem of synchronization. If the width of the input feature is too narrow, the overhead of lane synchronization … . But it was assumed that the temporal dimension of 3D CNN (the maximum is generally 16 and it will decrease with layer) will expand with Diffy. Secondly, it can’t skip zero, because of the synchronization of lane and the incremental of spatial/temporal delta. So if I want to make a change the whole paper need to be rewrite. It is unrealistic to propose a totally new idea before the final version. After I communicated with Tao Li, it turned out that I have to fix the paper by myself. Until today I am still unable to patch up any of those issues. These issues are too obvious which can be easily caught by any experts of accelerator. I have no words to comment that Dr. Li acquiesced to the data which makes no sense.</p><p id="f282">Considering that this will have an impact on my career in the future and my reputation in the area of Computer Architecture, my future life will be worse than death and I will be totally in a dilemma. I considered all the cases, I really can’t work them around. In order to make up for the fault, I decide to suicide. I hope you can learn my lessons and don’t mess around things. We shall never claim too much in the paper before we can really achieve it. I hope this will make a change in this world.</p><p id="83ee">I hope you can keep simple and stay honest in this society.

            <span>Abstract:</span>The rise of large language models (LLMs) has transformed the role of information retrieval (IR) systems in the way to humans accessing information. Due to the isolated architecture and the limited interaction, existing IR systems are unable to fully accommodate the shift from directly providing information to humans to indirectly serving large language models. In this paper, we propose Self-Retrieval, an end-to-end, LLM-driven information retrieval architecture that can fully internalize the required abilities of IR systems into a single LLM and deeply leverage the capabilities of LLMs during IR process. Specifically, Self-retrieval internalizes the corpus to retrieve into a LLM via a natural language indexing architecture. Then the entire retrieval process is redefined as a procedure of document generation and self-assessment, which can be end-to-end executed using a single large language model. Experimental results demonstrate that Self-Retrieval not only significantly outperforms previous retrieval approaches by a large margin, but also can significantly boost the performance of LLM-driven downstream applications like retrieval augumented generation.

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Installation</h2><a id="user-content-installation" aria-label="Permalink: Installation" href="#installation"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The recommended way to install <strong>TimeLapze</strong> is through <a href="https://brew.sh/" rel="nofollow">Homebrew</a> cask.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="brew install --cask https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wkaisertexas/ScreenTimeLapse/main/screentimelapse.rb "><pre>brew install --cask https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wkaisertexas/ScreenTimeLapse/main/screentimelapse.rb </pre></div>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Note: once this repo gets <strong>75 stars</strong> and <strong>30 watchers</strong> you will be able to install the app using <code>brew install --cask screentimelapse</code>. Additionally, the application is <strong>not signed</strong> so Apple will give you a scary warning about how the app can not be checked for malware. You can go in system settings to launch it anyways.</p>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Direct Download</h2><a id="user-content-direct-download" aria-label="Permalink: Direct Download" href="#direct-download"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">If you wish, you can go directly to the <a href="https://github.com/wkaisertexas/ScreenTimeLapse/releases">releases page</a> and download <code>TimeLapze.zip</code>. Both Chrome and Safari give a warning about downloading suspicious files. Ignore then, extract the archive and you should get a <code>ScreenTimeLapse.app</code> file. Move that file into your <code>Applications</code> directory.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Local Development</h2><a id="user-content-local-development" aria-label="Permalink: Local Development" href="#local-development"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">To develop TimeLapze locally, you will need to clone and open this repository in XCode.</p>
<p dir="auto">Once that's done, you can use the following commands to run the app locally:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="git clone https://github.com/wkaisertexas/ScreenTimeLapse
cd ScreenTimeLapse
open TimeLapze.xcodeproj"><pre><span>git clone https://github.com/wkaisertexas/ScreenTimeLapse</span>
<span>cd ScreenTimeLapse</span>
<span>open TimeLapze.xcodeproj</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Following this, you need to allow the app to be built for local signining.</p>

<p>Tesla has started shipping its ‘Basecamp’, a $3,000 tent designed for the back of the Cybertruck. It’s a bit of a This disappointment as it looks nothing like what was originally unveiled.</p>



<p>Accessories are big with trucks. Their form factor open up a bunch of interesting possibilities with the bed, but the Cybertruck’s specific design with the angle on the bed makes it more difficult to use some off-the-shelves accessories.</p>



<p>To address that, Tesla has planned a series of accessories designed specifically for the Cybertruck.</p>



<p>One of them is Basecamp, a tent that fits in the back of the electric pickup truck. It was first announced with the original unveiling of the Cybertruck in 2019:</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" width="1144" height="583" src="https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/02/Tesla-Cybertruck-camper-1-e1574434915159.jpg?quality=82&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024" alt="" srcset="https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/02/Tesla-Cybertruck-camper-1-e1574434915159.jpg 1144w, https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/02/Tesla-Cybertruck-camper-1-e1574434915159.jpg?resize=150,76 150w, https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/02/Tesla-Cybertruck-camper-1-e1574434915159.jpg?resize=300,153 300w, https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/02/Tesla-Cybertruck-camper-1-e1574434915159.jpg?resize=768,391 768w, https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/02/Tesla-Cybertruck-camper-1-e1574434915159.jpg?resize=1024,522 1024w, https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/02/Tesla-Cybertruck-camper-1-e1574434915159.jpg?resize=350,178 350w, https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/02/Tesla-Cybertruck-camper-1-e1574434915159.jpg?resize=140,71 140w" sizes="(max-width: 1144px) 100vw, 1144px"></figure>



<p>This looked like an interesting design with seemingly a rigid  bottom half that matched the design of the truck.</p>



<p>The product became ‘Basecamp’ and was <a href="https://electrek.co/2023/11/30/teslas-cybertruck-basecamp-is-a-funky-2975-tent-attachment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released for sale</a> shortly after Tesla revealed the production version of the truck last year. It already seemed to be a lot less attractive design at that point:</p>

<p>Now, Tesla has started shipping, or rather installing, the Basecamp for early Cybertruck owners.</p>



<p>I say “installing” because you need your first installation to happen at a Tesla Service Center to attach the tent’s brakets, which support the base of the tent, to the Cybertruck’s vault side rails.</p>



<p>A Cybertruck owner going by ‘TownBiz’ on <a href="https://www.cybertruckownersclub.com/forum/threads/basecamp-tent-first-review-%E2%9B%BA%EF%B8%8E.12964/">Cybertruck Owners Club</a> received one of the very first Basecamp and gave a first impression review of the tent system:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>‘Although Tesla is requiring SCs to do the initial install, in reality both install and removal of the tent from the bed (aka “vault”) is straightforward as long as you can deadlift 90lbs and/or have a buddy to help lift. Basecamp comes with 6 brackets that attach to the vault’s side rails and have specific spacing. Attaching these brackets is simple: same as how you attach your bottle opener or tie down points that come with Foundation Series trucks. Assuming Tesla is requiring the SC to do it just because of potential liability issues w/ people not putting the brackets in the right positions. That said, the manual provides install instructions for anyone to put these brackets in, so I suspect that one day Tesla may direct ship to customers. The trickiest parts of initial install are setting the stowed Basecamp in the right slot (need to put it in at a slight angle closest to the bed of the truck) and aligning the two T25 bolts that secure Basecamp’s frame to the truck. The manual recommends using a flashlight so you can align the holes and that really does make it pretty easy. Unfortunately the SC installer had some difficulty with this initially and scratched one of my brackets and may have also slightly messed up the threading on that bracket because it’s a little loose – not a show stopper, and theoretically a replaceable part. Once you remove those two T25 bolts, you can take the zipped up Basecamp with frame out of the truck and store it at home. This is welcome news because it definitely cuts into the length of your bed/vault (a bit more than 1/3 closest to the cab of the truck) if you like to transport adult sized mountain bikes using a tailgate pad. Otherwise, as mentioned the design is great because you can store gear under the stowed Basecamp.’</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Here’s what the production version of the Basecamp looks like on the Cybertruck:</p>

<p>Obviously, it looks nothing like the original render and arguably, it doesn’t look as good. To be fair, it should look better with the awning out, but they haven’t installed it in this case.</p>

<p>The owner has noted a few issues with the installation, packing, and unpacking process. He is not sure if he can recommend it for $3,000:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Because the rainy weather hasn’t allowed me to do a full setup + takedown more than once, I still can’t definitively say whether or not I recommend the $3K Basecamp. On one hand, I think that much of the thoughtful and unique design elements might warrant the cost: it’s fairly lightweight + easy to install/remove the stowed tent from the truck, stays out of the way (unless you want to transport multiple bikes in the bed), doesn’t reduce range due to decreased aerodynamics, and has intuitive pieces that make setup + takedown a breeze. On the other hand, there are some unpolished areas that stick out because of all those great elements I mentioned already: removing + re-installing the “Aeroflap” and the frustration of fitting and zipping up the stowed Basecamp in softcover after you finish using the tent. The three minor damaged pieces (the scuffed + potentially thread damaged middle bracket where a T25 bolt secures the stowed Basecamp to the bed rail, one of the leg quick release buttons, and the nylon webbing for one of the cobra buckle retainers) that I mentioned might have been better designed and will need to be fixed too, but because they don’t impede the function of the tent they’re not show stoppers. The currently MIA “Tent Mode” is also a bit of a red flag because the rumoured self-levelling element is a pretty big deal for roof-top-tent camping – briefly laying on the sleeping mat while parked in my gently sloped driveway I could feel myself rolling downhill. If Tesla releases Tent Mode to all CT owners or only verified Basecamp owners may be a deciding factor for people buying the Basecamp or waiting for a 3rd party solution (theoretically if a maker creates cross bars for the vault, other folding rooftop tents that are not wider than the vault/bed could work nicely). $3K is a serious chunk of change and you could buy a lot of sweet camping gear with it. However, as I mentioned at the start, evidently $3K for a high quality rooftop tent is not that crazy.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The ‘Tent Mode’ is expected to enable an auto leveling of the truck with its air suspension, but the software is nowhere to be found in Cybertrucks right now.</p>



<p>There’s unfortunately no way to link the truck’s AC to the tent with this system.</p>



<h2 id="h-electrek-s-take">Electrek’s Take</h2>




	<p>In my opinion, this is definitely a disapointment for the price and in comparison to the original renders. </p>



<p>$3,000 is no joke. You can get some awesome tents for that price.</p>



<p>Sounds like you would be better off with an off-truck tent or maybe an off-the-shevel roof tent if you can have some kind of cross bar accessory to make the Cybertruck’s roof flat and able to receive the tent.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="container"><article><p>A simple dice game shines a bit of light on the psychology of regret.</p><figure><img width="700" height="420" src="https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/regret-700x420.jpg" alt="" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high"></figure><p>One of the primary motivators of human behavior is avoiding regret. Before the legendary behavioral economists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky formalized prospect theory and loss aversion, they believed that regret avoidance was at the root of the human behaviors they were studying. However, they learned that there are behaviors that regret avoidance could not explain and were led to a broader picture.</p><p>Let’s take a look at a simple game that sheds a bit more light on the psychology of regret.</p><p>I have two dice — one red, one white — and two identical cups. I secretly place one die under each cup (no trickery), mix them up, and ask you to select the cup with the red die. You did not see me put the dice under the cups, so you have absolutely no information on which to base your decision. If you make the right choice, I give you $5. If not, you gain nothing.</p><p>Go ahead and select one of the cups. Let’s say you pick the cup on the right. I slide it toward you but don’t let you look underneath.</p><p>I then ask you if you want to switch to the cup on the left, to change your choice.</p><p>Would you switch? The majority of people do not; about 90 percent do not switch, <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01019932" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">according to studies</a>. Personally, I do this experiment with my class and at other presentations, and I have yet to have someone switch when offered the opportunity.</p><p>Why is that? The odds of being right are 50-50, so why not switch?</p><p>Experimenters point to two reasons. First is the endowment effect, which posits that once you perceive ownership of an item, it subtly becomes yours — and it becomes more valuable to you than an equivalent item you do not own. Once you select a cup, it subtly becomes yours — and it becomes more valuable to you than the other cup. Moving the cup so that it is in front of you amplifies this effect, as the cup is moved into your personal space.</p><p>The second reason is that, psychologically, one of the drivers of our actions is our effort to minimize regret. If we make a choice and it turns out to be wrong, we feel bad. But what if we make a choice, switch, and then find out our first decision was actually correct? We feel worse. We know this about ourselves, and so, when presented with the option to switch away from our cup, it is not very enticing to do so.</p><p>We can explore exactly how much worse we feel if we switch and are wrong through a simple experiment.</p><p>In our game, if you pick the cup that has the red die, you win $5. Now let’s say I change the rules slightly. After you’ve made your cup choice, I give you the option of switching to the other cup as usual. But now, if you switch and are correct, you win $6. If you stick with your original choice and are right, you still only get $5. Would you switch now?</p><p>Again, most people would not switch.</p><p>What if I offered you $10 if you switch and win? What about $15?</p><p>Researchers have performed these experiments, and the results are illuminating. At triple the value, 50 percent of people switch. You need to get to 10 times the value before 90 percent of people switch.</p><p>Experiments like this, by the way, are one of the methods that researchers use to figure out how much worse loss aversion makes things feel. This puts it at around three times as bad, which is in line with the two to three times values seen in other experiments.</p><p>When I was in school and taking multiple choice exams, the advice was always to “stick with your first instinct” rather than to change to a different answer. I am now convinced that this advice does not give you a better chance at getting the correct answer — but it does make people feel better than if they get it wrong and find out their original choice was correct. I would much prefer getting it wrong with my first guess than changing away from the right answer!</p><hr><p><em><strong>Geoffrey Engelstein</strong> is an award-winning tabletop game designer who teaches game design at New York University.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
          

            <p>In the predawn hours of Sept. 5, 2021, engineers achieved a major milestone in the labs of MIT’s Plasma Science and Fusion Center (PSFC), when a new type of magnet, made from high-temperature superconducting material, achieved a world-record magnetic field strength of 20 tesla for a large-scale magnet. That’s the intensity needed to build a fusion power plant that is expected to produce a net output of power and potentially usher in an era of virtually limitless power production.</p>



<p>The test was immediately declared a success, having met all the criteria established for the design of the new fusion device, dubbed SPARC, for which the magnets are the key enabling technology. Champagne corks popped as the weary team of experimenters, who had labored long and hard to make the achievement possible, celebrated their accomplishment.</p>



<p>But that was far from the end of the process. Over the ensuing months, the team tore apart and inspected the components of the magnet, pored over and analyzed the data from hundreds of instruments that recorded details of the tests, and performed two additional test runs on the same magnet, ultimately pushing it to its breaking point in order to learn the details of any possible failure modes.</p>



<p>All of this work has now culminated in a detailed report by researchers at PSFC and MIT spinout company Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS), published in a <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10348035&amp;punumber=77" target="_blank">collection of six peer-reviewed papers</a> in a special edition of the March issue of <em>IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity</em>. Together, the papers describe the design and fabrication of the magnet and the diagnostic equipment needed to evaluate its performance, as well as the lessons learned from the process. Overall, the team found, the predictions and computer modeling were spot-on, verifying that the magnet’s unique design elements could serve as the foundation for a fusion power plant.</p>



<p><strong>Enabling practical fusion power</strong></p>



<p>The successful test of the magnet, says Hitachi America Professor of Engineering Dennis Whyte, who recently stepped down as director of the PSFC, was “the most important thing, in my opinion, in the last 30 years of fusion research.”</p>



<p>Before the Sept. 5 demonstration, the best-available superconducting magnets were powerful enough to potentially achieve fusion energy — but only at sizes and costs that could never be practical or economically viable. Then, when the tests showed the practicality of such a strong magnet at a greatly reduced size, “overnight, it basically changed the cost per watt of a fusion reactor by a factor of almost 40 in one day,” Whyte says.</p>



<p>“Now fusion has a chance,” Whyte adds. Tokamaks, the most widely used design for experimental fusion devices, “have a chance, in my opinion, of being economical because you’ve got a quantum change in your ability, with the known confinement physics rules, about being able to greatly reduce the size and the cost of objects that would make fusion possible.”</p>



<p>The comprehensive data and analysis from the PSFC’s magnet test, as detailed in the six new papers, has demonstrated that plans for a new generation of fusion devices — the one designed by MIT and CFS, as well as similar designs by other commercial fusion companies — are built on a solid foundation in science.</p>



<p><strong>The superconducting breakthrough</strong></p>



<p>Fusion, the process of combining light atoms to form heavier ones, powers the sun and stars, but harnessing that process on Earth has proved to be a daunting challenge, with decades of hard work and many billions of dollars spent on experimental devices. The long-sought, but never yet achieved, goal is to build a fusion power plant that produces more energy than it consumes. Such a power plant could produce electricity without emitting greenhouse gases during operation, and generating very little radioactive waste. Fusion’s fuel, a form of hydrogen that can be derived from seawater, is virtually limitless.</p>



<p>But to make it work requires compressing the fuel at extraordinarily high temperatures and pressures, and since no known material could withstand such temperatures, the fuel must be held in place by extremely powerful magnetic fields. Producing such strong fields requires superconducting magnets, but all previous fusion magnets have been made with a superconducting material that requires frigid temperatures of about 4 degrees above absolute zero (4 kelvins, or -270 degrees Celsius). In the last few years, a newer material nicknamed REBCO, for rare-earth barium copper oxide, was added to fusion magnets, and allows them to operate at 20 kelvins, a temperature that despite being only 16 kelvins warmer, brings significant advantages in terms of material properties and practical engineering.</p>



<p>Taking advantage of this new higher-temperature superconducting material was not just a matter of substituting it in existing magnet designs. Instead, “it was a rework from the ground up of almost all the principles that you use to build superconducting magnets,” Whyte says. The new REBCO material is “extraordinarily different than the previous generation of superconductors. You’re not just going to adapt and replace, you’re actually going to innovate from the ground up.” The new papers in <em>Transactions on Applied Superconductivity</em> describe the details of that redesign process, now that patent protection is in place.</p>



<p><strong>A key innovation: no insulation</strong></p>



<p>One of the dramatic innovations, which had many others in the field skeptical of its chances of success, was the elimination of insulation around the thin, flat ribbons of superconducting tape that formed the magnet. Like virtually all electrical wires, conventional superconducting magnets are fully protected by insulating material to prevent short-circuits between the wires. But in the new magnet, the tape was left completely bare; the engineers relied on REBCO’s much greater conductivity to keep the current flowing through the material.</p>



<p>“When we started this project, in let’s say 2018, the technology of using high-temperature superconductors to build large-scale high-field magnets was in its infancy,” says Zach Hartwig, the Robert N. Noyce Career Development Professor in the Department of Nuclear Science and Engineering. Hartwig has a co-appointment at the PSFC and is the head of its engineering group, which led the magnet development project. “The state of the art was small benchtop experiments, not really representative of what it takes to build a full-size thing. Our magnet development project started at benchtop scale and ended up at full scale in a short amount of time,” he adds, noting that the team built a 20,000-pound magnet that produced a steady, even magnetic field of just over 20 tesla — far beyond any such field ever produced at large scale.</p>



<p>“The standard way to build these magnets is you would wind the conductor and you have insulation between the windings, and you need insulation to deal with the high voltages that are generated during off-normal events such as a shutdown.” Eliminating the layers of insulation, he says, “has the advantage of being a low-voltage system. It greatly simplifies the fabrication processes and schedule.” It also leaves more room for other elements, such as more cooling or more structure for strength.</p>



<p>The magnet assembly is a slightly smaller-scale version of the ones that will form the donut-shaped chamber of the SPARC fusion device now being built by CFS in Devens, Massachusetts. It consists of 16 plates, called pancakes, each bearing a spiral winding of the superconducting tape on one side and cooling channels for helium gas on the other.</p>



<p>But the no-insulation design was considered risky, and a lot was riding on the test program. “This was the first magnet at any sufficient scale that really probed what is involved in designing and building and testing a magnet with this so-called no-insulation no-twist technology,” Hartwig says. “It was very much a surprise to the community when we announced that it was a no-insulation coil.”</p>



<p><strong>Pushing to the limit … and beyond</strong></p>



<p>The initial test, described in previous papers, proved that the design and manufacturing process not only worked but was highly stable — something that some researchers had doubted. The next two test runs, also performed in late 2021, then pushed the device to the limit by deliberately creating unstable conditions, including a complete shutoff of incoming power that can lead to a catastrophic overheating. Known as quenching, this is considered a worst-case scenario for the operation of such magnets, with the potential to destroy the equipment.</p>



<p>Part of the mission of the test program, Hartwig says, was “to actually go off and intentionally quench a full-scale magnet, so that we can get the critical data at the right scale and the right conditions to advance the science, to validate the design codes, and then to take the magnet apart and see what went wrong, why did it go wrong, and how do we take the next iteration toward fixing that. … It was a very successful test.”</p>



<p>That final test, which ended with the melting of one corner of one of the 16 pancakes, produced a wealth of new information, Hartwig says. For one thing, they had been using several different computational models to design and predict the performance of various aspects of the magnet’s performance, and for the most part, the models agreed in their overall predictions and were well-validated by the series of tests and real-world measurements. But in predicting the effect of the quench, the model predictions diverged, so it was necessary to get the experimental data to evaluate the models’ validity.</p>



<p>“The highest-fidelity models that we had predicted almost exactly how the magnet would warm up, to what degree it would warm up as it started to quench, and where would the resulting damage to the magnet would be,” he says. As described in detail in one of the new reports, “That test actually told us exactly the physics that was going on, and it told us which models were useful going forward and which to leave by the wayside because they’re not right.”</p>



<p>Whyte says, “Basically we did the worst thing possible to a coil, on purpose, after we had tested all other aspects of the coil performance. And we found that most of the coil survived with no damage,” while one isolated area sustained some melting. “It’s like a few percent of the volume of the coil that got damaged.” And that led to revisions in the design that are expected to prevent such damage in the actual fusion device magnets, even under the most extreme conditions.</p>



<p>Hartwig emphasizes that a major reason the team was able to accomplish such a radical new record-setting magnet design, and get it right the very first time and on a breakneck schedule, was thanks to the deep level of knowledge, expertise, and equipment accumulated over decades of operation of the Alcator C-Mod tokamak, the Francis Bitter Magnet Laboratory, and other work carried out at PSFC. “This goes to the heart of the institutional capabilities of a place like this,” he says. “We had the capability, the infrastructure, and the space and the people to do these things under one roof.”</p>



<p>The collaboration with CFS was also key, he says, with MIT and CFS combining the most powerful aspects of an academic institution and private company to do things together that neither could have done on their own. “For example, one of the major contributions from CFS was leveraging the power of a private company to establish and scale up a supply chain at an unprecedented level and timeline for the most critical material in the project: 300 kilometers (186 miles) of high-temperature superconductor, which was procured with rigorous quality control in under a year, and integrated on schedule into the magnet.”</p>



<p>The integration of the two teams, those from MIT and those from CFS, also was crucial to the success, he says. “We thought of ourselves as one team, and that made it possible to do what we did.”</p>
