    <p>We all know the current US President is one hell of an orator and often assures us that he has “the best words”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I went to an Ivy League school. I’m very highly educated. I know words. I have the best words.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The man knows words. Says so right there. While some might view his non-sequitur ramblings as the nascent stages of dementia or an unfiltered ADHD brain launching into successive short (at times racist) bullet-point diatribes based on the last word or phrase he said like a cursed game of word association, the President asserts this is not the case:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You know, I do the weave. You know what the weave is? I’ll talk about, like, nine different things, and they all come back brilliantly together. And it’s like - and friends of mine that are, like, English professors - they say, it’s the most brilliant thing I’ve ever seen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“<a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/09/13/nx-s1-5107714/breaking-down-former-president-donald-trumps-rambling-linguistic-style">The Weave</a>” re-entered my consciousness this week after I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_Ds1Cz-LpA">a quick snippet of an Oval Office event</a> where Trump says the (“radical left-wing”) CBO projects tariffs will reduce the deficit by $4 trillion USD. I was skeptical –<a href="https://youtu.be/ab9yLd3OjSw">and for good reason</a>– but I tuned in. What shocked me was not the complete lack of specifics about the CBO projection, but rather the actual reason for the Oval Office meeting: a FIFA event? Wow.</p>

<p>For awhile now, I’ve clued into the cyclical pattern of his speeches, little snippets of “the best words” and talking points assembled like a ransom note cut from a magazine. I often wondered if it’s possible to diagram “the weave”. The “branching” narratives Trump uses made me think a git-graph-style visualization was apropos. So I grabbed a transcript and got to work.</p>
<p>For my first attempt, I used <a href="https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/gitgraph.html">Mermaid.js’ GitGraph Diagram</a> which worked well but only supports horizontal charts. As I sat with it I realized I wanted a chronological list of statements that read like a transcript. I repurposed the Mermaid’s GitGraph DSL and made a web component called <code>&lt;git-graph&gt;</code> to help me visualize and document Trump’s derailing trains of thought from the above event.</p>

<p>By my count in that four-minute address there were ten distinct themes or “branches”, most of which are common grievances or rhetorical themes found in nearly all Trump speeches. I used “cherry-picking” to model callbacks to a previous statement (e.g. “the stock market is up”) that seem to reverberate into later trains of thought, a quintessential feature of the weave.</p>
<p>Four minutes of the weave was about all I could handle but I think this visualization models what I experience when trying to follow along to the President’s speeches. One or two phrases on a topic, then jumping to a new topic, weaving in a (sometimes unrelated) point from a previous topic to make the thought appear more cohesive and linear, then driving deep down an inconsequential topic. When he talks so long about ten different topics at a time, I’d forgive you for thinking he said something salient. But when you break it down you see it for what it is: a mishmash of talking points.</p>

<div><p>Go Beato, go! </p><p>For 15+ years, Saving Country Music has been on the warpath against the completely ludicrous intellectual property regime that disallows even a small snippet of music to be featured in a podcast without draconious repercussions, including removing episodes, and deleting entire accounts, while not offering any reasonable alternative solutions to the issue. </p><p>On YouTube videos, creators can freely filch copyrighted photos and other people’s videos virtually free of ramifications. You can take an entire 2 1/2 hour film, impose it over a background, and upload it to YouTube, and usually avoid any problems. But feature a barely audible 8 1/2-second clip of music underneath audio dialogue, and you could have your entire podcast career evaporate overnight. </p><p>Music labels have been leaving major opportunities to promote their catalogs and performers on the table with their punitive copyright claims that make it impossible to feature music on music podcasts and other platforms. And instead of trying to build a system where perhaps there’s more reasonable revenue sharing or other opportunities for artists and songwriters through these podcast platforms to promote their music, it’s the punitive measures of record labels that eliminate these opportunities in lose/lose scenarios. </p><p>Music video podcaster Rick Beato with his massive 5 million-plus subscriber base finally got fed up with it, and posted a rant on Tuesday, August 19th about this, and, it’s a thing of beauty. </p><p><em>“I hate making these videos, but I really need to because it seems the only thing that ever gets done is when you talk about this stuff,”</em> Beato starts off. But one of the nauseating things about this issue is that we’ve been talking about it for going on two decades, and still nothing is getting done about it. Saving Country Music posted about this issue <strong><a href="https://savingcountrymusic.com/music-remains-sidelined-from-immense-podcast-opportunities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">in 2024</a></strong>, and <strong><a href="https://savingcountrymusic.com/music-being-left-on-the-sidelines-of-the-podcast-revolution/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">in 2020</a></strong>, and as far back as 2010, with no real movement on the issue. </p><p>Luckily though, Rick Beato has a much bigger bullhorn, though he has brought up the issue before to no avail, though not in such a dedicated and forceful manner. </p><p>Beato’s specific beef is with Universal Music Group, who is the most notorious actor for bringing these heavy handed claims against song clip uses that clearly fall under the fair use clauses of American copyright law, let alone are being brought against a guy who operates a massive music platform that promotes artists. But since there’s rarely humans making any of these decisions and it’s automated by bots, they don’t understand these claims are against Universal Music’s best interests. </p><p><em>“I’m doing interviews with people and playing the music that they either wrote or recorded, or they produced,”</em> Beato explains. <em>“You need to play people music to talk about it. That is the definition of fair use. These are interviews with people about their careers. Why are these record labels wanting to take down content about artist that have records on their label? What sense does that make?”</em> <br><em><br>“Give it a rest,”</em> he continues. <em>“My God. If I didn’t fight these three claims, my channel would get taken down with my 2,000 videos. Is that ridiculous? It’s ridiculous to me. And they’re for interviews.”</em></p></div>

<div><p>People continue to ask, “Why doesn’t Saving Country Music has a podcast?” Because what’s the point of having a music podcast when you can’t feature music? In fact, after over a decade of refusing to start one, I finally did, music free. What happened? About a dozen episodes in, someone took out a claim, and not only were all the episodes deleted, so was the entire account, even though no music even appeared on any of the episodes. I was given absolutely no recourse to fight whatever false claim had been made. </p><p>For the record, Saving Country Music’s <strong><a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/22c3jmmYIz8y4OfVQLTcNS?si=737ab19922384772" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">Country History X</a></strong> podcast remains live. But it’s been difficult to pursue it, knowing it could summarily disappear at any moment. People have lost thousands of episodes and videos over this issue. Meanwhile, you can use extended song clips on Instagram, TikTok, and Facebook. It has become an excellent way to promote songs and artists. These networks facilitate this music sharing, and credit the artists for their work. </p><p>The music industry continues to so colossal fail the artists and catalogs they represent, and the fans they’re supposed to serve with this current system of how podcasts are handled. If everything changes today thanks to the Rick Beato rant, it would still be 15 years too late. But at least it would happen. The powers that be in the music industry need to recognize that the power base in media is moving to podcasting, and they need to make music available to podcasters in a way that’s fair to all parties. </p><p>In fact in some respects we’re moving backwards on this issue. A couple of years ago, Spotify did offer the ability for podcasters to embed full songs in episodes. But they’ve since discontinued that program. </p><p>Let’s do this. It’s well beyond the time to solve this problem. You aren’t screwing podcasters. You’re screwing artists who could be using podcasts to help promote their music. Hopefully Rick Beato’s rant finally reaches the right ears. </p><p>– – – – – – –</p></div>

  <p><span>August 30, 2025</span>

  </p>


  <p>I got a Kobo in 2016 after borrowing my mom's old one for a year before that. It probably is responsible for getting me reading again after high school. I used to be an avid reader, the sort of kid who would have to be told to put down the book and go to sleep, and who would then creep slowly to the bookshelf to pick it up again without arousing suspicion after the light had been turned out. I think I slowed my reading for fun as the work load of school increased, and stopped when moving every four months for internships in university. Having something small and portable that I could load books onto changed that and got my momentum going again. I now loosely grade how much I'm thriving by how much I'm reading, as an indirect indicator of how not burnt out I am.</p><p>It fared me quite well, but I had a few issues with it. Library books would randomly not work on it, even if they would show up on, for example, the Libby app on my phone. It also came with a way to sync articles to it via Pocket, but it always required a little too much forethought for me: I had to remember to find and save articles beforehand in order to then read them later. There were some services to do this automatically via RSS but the syncing process itself was just slow enough that I found myself rarely doing it. Also, Mozilla has now killed Pocket as a service. In the middle of writing this, they announced support for Instapaper instead, but it has the same workflow issues for me. My partner reads on her phone, but something about reading on a screen grates on me after a while, and makes it too easy to jump to something else.</p><p>So I was intrigued when I heard about the Minimal Phone, an Android phone with an epaper display. It wasn't the first epaper Android device I'd seen—I've seen reviews saying the Boox Palma is actually pretty great—but it was the idea of this being an actual <em>phone</em> that can take a sim card that really get me interested. What if I could read the news and blogs on what looks like paper while commuting, without having the forethought of downloading or syncing something? I might otherwise spend that time staring into space or looking at nothing on Bluesky. I'd probably rather be reading a bit of a book, or other longer-form writing. So I ordered one as a gift to myself.</p><div><p><a href="https://www.davepagurek.com/content/images/2025/08/mp.jpg"><img src="https://www.davepagurek.com/content/images/2025/08/mp.jpg"></a></p><p>The MP01</p></div><p>I figured I might be a good fit for this device. I don't really watch videos on my phone. I send messages a bit, but not urgently. Most of the time I'm at or near a full keyboard anyway. I take some photos, but not that many any more. I feel like the photo winds changed for me sometime in university and I now feel weird posting Nice Photos to social media. Who are those for, really? I now send quick photos directly to friends mostly, and they don't have to be print quality or anything. They just have to be visible.</p><p>With that in mind, I went in treating it like an experiment. I still have my Kobo that has its annoyances but works. I still have a fully functional Pixel 8 phone. I don't <em>need</em> this to work. At worst, this could just be an alternate ereader for me. So when it arrived mid-July, I started testing it full-time to see how it'd go, with my normal phone in my bag just in case.</p><p>Overall, I actually really like it! I absolutely would not recommend this device to everyone—I'll get into why later—but it's been working pretty well for <em>me.</em></p><h2> How the Minimal Phone works</h2><p>This phone is around the same size of my Pixel 8. It's just a tad shorter and just a tad wider. I don't really feel the shortness, but I do feel the wideness a bit, which makes it more comfortable to read on. The bottom third of the height is taken up by a physical keyboard, and the top two thirds are an epaper display.</p><p>It's just Android under there, with a black-and-white epaper display. It comes with a few launchers, and I use one that works like a pretty traditional launcher, but comes with some built in icon choices that look sharp on the display.</p><p>There's a side button between the phone's volume keys that you can tap to flash the display to clear ghosting. I don't find myself doing this often—ghosting is not that bad—but if you press and hold it, it opens the display settings. <em>This</em> is something I do all the time.</p><div><p><a href="https://www.davepagurek.com/content/images/2025/08/settings.jpg"><img src="https://www.davepagurek.com/content/images/2025/08/settings.jpg"></a></p><p>The quick display settings screen, which you get to by pressing and holding the button between the volume keys.</p></div><p>From the settings screen, you can turn on and off the light on the display and on the keyboard, and also change the display light's colour temperature. I mostly leave those off; I only need those if I'm outside after dark, and the controls are big enough that I can turn them on easily enough in low light.</p><p>The most important setting is the refresh rate at the bottom. The slowest setting has the slowest refresh rate, but the highest quality visuals: always showing nice shades of grey, and with less ghosting but more flashing as it updates. The fastest setting (which, to be clear, is still not very fast) has much less flashing, a little more ghosting, and dithers pure black and white rather than showing any shades of grey. The middle setting, "hybrid" mode, is a combination of the two: it uses the faster setting while things are moving onscreen, and then updates to the slower, higher quality render when movement stops. I generally keep the phone in this hybrid mode, except for a few specific cases.</p><p>The keyboard feels pretty good, and it's a comfortable size to type on with two thumbs. I can't really one-handed type on this phone; it's a tad too wide for that, but the width is worth it for easier reading. I really appreciate them including the keyboard here, as the display looks great but is definitely not all that responsive, so typing would be a lot more frustrating without this.</p><h2> The great parts</h2><p>This thing is <em>so</em> nice to read on.</p><p>I hate reading on screens. Something about dark mode especially messes with my eyes, but even without that, I've never enjoyed reading articles on my phone. Too easy to get distracted, the minor eye strain... This device though, the epaper display looks great. It's not especially high resolution or anything, but I could spend a long time reading on this without issue. I just spent two flights (Toronto to Vancouver and back again) just reading books on this, and I'd do it again. It's really crisp and visible in the sun too.</p><div><p><a href="https://www.davepagurek.com/content/images/2025/08/reading.jpg"><img src="https://www.davepagurek.com/content/images/2025/08/reading.jpg"></a></p><p>A page of a book in the Libby app.</p></div><p>It's super easy to queue up library book holds and read them all from the phone. I have had zero issues with that. Being able to add new things on-the-go has also made it really easy to grab another book on the spot once I finish one. I definitely have found myself reading more books this past month and a half.</p><p>I also now am more likely to read people's blogs on an RSS reader than scroll through social media. I wasn't setting out to fully purge social media or anything, but I certainly feel a little more fulfilled after reading something that someone has clearly put time and effort into.</p><p>Possibly as a consequence of the display technology, I also generally get 2 days of usage out of a charge. Most days I finish with 70% battery remaining, letting me go another day with some buffer room. On some really low usage days, I could maybe even go more, but already this is great. On a high usage day, I'll maybe end with 50%, which is still fine by me.</p><p>This is secondary, by far, but I also feel now that I can fully turn off autocorrect, as this phone has a physical keyboard. Most of the time (with important caveats), I don't make typos. So I no longer have to suffer through autocorrect changing programming terms (which I still type a lot of), changing my capitalization, or doing its own insane capitalization (why would it format "city Hall" with just one capital? Commit to capitals or no capitals, don't do this awkward mix!)</p><div><p><a href="https://www.davepagurek.com/content/images/2025/08/theverge.jpg"><img src="https://www.davepagurek.com/content/images/2025/08/theverge.jpg" width="600"></a></p><p>An article on The Verge. Hey, it was the top post in the feed when I took the photo!</p></div><p>As another minor note, the fingerprint reader is actually quite fast. When it remembers my fingerprints, it's super reliable. ("What do you mean, <em>when</em> it remembers?" I'll get into it later, there's a pretty bad bug here. But in regular usage, it really does work well.)</p><p>Everything else this phone does, it does a little worse than a normal phone, but not so much worse that it's a problem. I assume it would be a lot worse at watching videos but I never really did that much on my old phone anyway. So on the whole, this phone works really well where I want it to, and generally gets out of my way for the usual stuff. I keep using it without really worrying about it.</p><p>The camera, once set up properly, is pretty passable. Well, the selfie camera is in a super awkward spot, but I don't really find myself using it anyway. But other photos look decent enough that I'm not embarrassed to send them to people!</p><div>  <div><p><a href="https://www.davepagurek.com/content/images/2025/08/cat.jpg"><img src="https://www.davepagurek.com/content/images/2025/08/cat.jpg"></a></p><p>My cat Pigeon looking out the window.</p></div>  <div><p><a href="https://www.davepagurek.com/content/images/2025/08/leaves.jpg"><img src="https://www.davepagurek.com/content/images/2025/08/leaves.jpg"></a></p><p>Toronto in the summer.</p></div></div><div>  <div><p><a href="https://www.davepagurek.com/content/images/2025/08/selfie.jpg"><img src="https://www.davepagurek.com/content/images/2025/08/selfie.jpg"></a></p><p>The selfie camera is a little sketchy, I wouldn't rely on it.</p></div>  <div><p><a href="https://www.davepagurek.com/content/images/2025/08/wizard.jpg"><img src="https://www.davepagurek.com/content/images/2025/08/wizard.jpg"></a></p><p>Phil Wizard breaking on Kits Beach in Vancouver.</p></div></div><h2> Growing pains</h2><p>Even though I do really like this thing, and am continuing to use it as my primary device, there are a lot of rough edges. This device is made by, primarily, two people (although they've been adding more developers in the past few weeks), so naturally there will be a lot of rough edges. You have to be willing to accept that if you're going to use this phone. They do make updates, but the pace is slow, and they are definitely bogged down by customer support and shipping/manufacturing logistics, so you need to not bank on fixes happening quickly.</p><p>There's a double-tap-to-wake feature that you can't turn off, and it takes a sec once locked to stop responding to inputs. Consequently, I now put this in my pocket with the display facing out, which is opposite of what I used to do, in order to prevent accidentally disturbing it in my pocket. Doing that, I haven't had issues, but it's an adjustment you have to make for this phone right now.</p><p>There are a few things you'll probably need to do to the device to make it work well for you. One of them involves the camera. By default, the camera super aggressively denoises its photos, resulting in images that look like they came off of my flip phone from 2008. However, if you use the Open Camera app, switch it to use the Camera 2 API, it then lets you turn off noise reduction in the settings. The resulting images look much crisper, and do have noise, but a tasteful—dare I say aesthetic?—amount of noise. There is no Pixel-style HDR in these photos, but now that that look is everywhere, the resulting photos are... kind of refreshing.</p><div><p><a href="https://www.davepagurek.com/content/images/2025/08/lexi.jpg"><img src="https://www.davepagurek.com/content/images/2025/08/lexi.jpg"></a></p><p>Taking a photo of fast a moving subject is quite hard on this thing due to the refresh rate of the screen. But then again, doesn't a photo like this capture the moment better? This is my aunt's cat Lexi.</p></div><p>The phone also uses something called Duraspeed to aggressively turn off background apps. This works well in general, but it also can stifle some notifications that you <em>do</em> want, and also can affect background audio. I know some people fully turn Duraspeed off, but I've just turned it off for my messaging apps and my music/podcast apps. I've had no notification or background process related issues since doing so.</p><p>I also found that the backlight was way too bright, and I didn't really want any lights on most of the time anyway. I found that when opening the display settings, it'd turn all the lights back on. But if I save a preset, then it'd stick. You can do that by changing the settings, and then pressing and holding on the wrench icon to save it to your custom preset.</p><p>Finally, the hybrid refresh mode needs things to stop moving in order to lock in on a higher quality render. That means animated ads are somehow even more annoying than they normally are. Thankfully, Firefox for Android lets you install addons, such as uBlock Origin, to deal with that.</p><h2> Bugs</h2><p>The most annoying bug is that this phone will occasionally restart and forget your fingerprint, forcing you to enter your PIN. I don't know why this happens. I can go for a few weeks with it working fine, and then it'll just forget. I can still get in with the PIN, so it's not locking me out, but there's really never a good time to re-set up a fingerprint, and typing a PIN on the onscreen display is slow and cumbersome. This is the bug I hope gets fixed the most.</p><p>Another bug has something to do with the screen refresh rate, and something to do with responding to keyboard input. If you're on a slower refresh rate and are typing quickly, sometimes it misses keypresses, and you have to go back and fix things. This is also quite annoying, but doesn't seem to happen on the highest screen refresh rate. As a workaround, when I'm sending messages, I switch to the fastest refresh setting. This one-or-the-other approach isn't great though (I still want photos sent to me in messaging apps to look nice!), so I'd love to see that improved over time.</p><p>I also <em>have</em> to use the phone in the lowest refresh rate for Google Maps in order to see the streets on the map. The color scheme is just too low contrast for the high refresh rate's dithering. The hybrid setting doesn't work either: your location on the map is always slightly moving and so it never locks in and renders a higher-quality image. Arguably, this is a problem with Google Maps because they don't have a high contrast mode. Surely that would have accessibility benefits beyond just this weird device!</p><div><p><a href="https://www.davepagurek.com/content/images/2025/08/maps.jpg"><img src="https://www.davepagurek.com/content/images/2025/08/maps.jpg" width="600"></a></p><p>Google Maps when in hybrid or fast mode. Where did the streets go??</p></div><p>There's a software update that the Minimal team has been working on for almost two months that will apparently address the fingerprint forgetting issue, make double-tap-to-wake optional, significantly increase the refresh rate on the fast refresh mode, and let you save per-app refresh rate settings. That'll address some of my problems for sure! But it also hasn't shipped yet. To use this device is an exercise in patience, and being accepting of imperfections.</p><h2> Feature Requests</h2><p>None of these are dealbreakers for me, but here's what I'm hoping to see in the future:</p><ul><li>I feel like the vibration on the phone is a tad aggressive. Not every vibration is, though—Facebook Messenger notifications feel like the right level. I'd love to be able to adjust the cap for vibration intensity!</li><li>I would love emoji search in the keyboard. But I also don't use that many different emoji or symbols, and by now the ones I do use are in the recents list, so it's fine. But the one time I need to use a weird one, it'd be nice to have!</li><li>I wish the hybrid refresh mode would work well with camera apps. As it is, I think too much of the screen is updating at once, so it flashes a large part of the display every frame, making it really hard to see. If I put the phone in fast mode, there's no flashing, which is great! But then when I take a photo and tap on the thumbnail to see it, I have to switch back to hybrid or slow mode to see a clearer, non-dithered version. This is a little annoying, and I feel could be improved, but then again I'm not really using this to take a lot of photos anyway.</li></ul><h2> Concluding the experiment</h2><p>It's been more than a month, and despite not everything being perfect, I'm going to continue using this phone. I do occasionally switch to my Pixel 8 though. I use my Pixel 8 for running for its better waterproofing. When I needed to get actual good, postable photos from SIGGRAPH two weeks ago, I just used my Pixel 8. When seeing LCD Soundsystem last weekend, rather than worry about weirdness with the Ticketmaster app, I just took my Pixel 8. But I've used normal boarding passes for airplanes on my MP01, and I regularly go out without a backup phone. I do mostly rely on my partner to do Google Maps navigation since that's a little bit smoother, although in a pinch I can still use it myself (and the Transit app is a little better in hybrid mode.)</p><p>Basically, I use the right tool for the job, and this phone doesn't have to be that tool for all jobs. But it turns out I don't need my phone to do all that many jobs, and it's maybe a good thing for it to be doing less of them.</p><p>There are enough quirks that I wouldn't automatically recommend this experience. But if you know what you're getting into and have the right expectations, this is a really great little device!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div lang="en-GB">
  <p>This is not the usual type of content you will have come to expect from Piccalilli, but I feel like this topic, specifically, is an important aspect of our work to cover because as I see it, making or encouraging your development staff to use AI tools in their work is extremely short-sighted and risky.</p>
<p>I want to support that stance with some conversations I’ve had with people actually <strong>doing the work</strong> and their mostly less than favourable experiences.</p>
<p>I asked this across question social media:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is your boss encouraging you to/making you use AI tools for development?</p>
<p>I’m thinking about working on a piece about that on
Piccalilli.</p>
<p>It’s sensitive for sure, so more than happy for people to be anonymised.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reason I asked was because — as you can imagine — I speak with <em>a lot</em> of developers on a day-to-day basis. A lot of the time in my personal network, these are very experienced, senior developers, but I’m hearing the same stories from juniors too. It boils down to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My boss is making/encouraging me to use AI every day and during every part of my work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I had an urge to explore this further — making sure I wasn’t in an echo chamber — and, yeh, you’re probably not going to enjoy what I discovered.</p>
<h2 id="before-we-dig-in-allow-me-to-set-some-ground-rules-and-facts">Before we dig in, allow me to set some ground rules and facts<a href="#before-we-dig-in-allow-me-to-set-some-ground-rules-and-facts"><span>permalink</span></a></h2>
<ol>
<li>If you’re a fan of AI companies/tools, this article is not a personal attack on your preference</li>
<li>This article does not de-value the good stuff you might feel like you’re doing with AI</li>
<li>All participants are completely anonymised for their privacy and protection</li>
<li>I have re-worked some of the responses to assist with point 3</li>
<li>Any opinions are mine unless specified</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="what-i-learned-from-my-conversations">What I learned from my conversations<a href="#what-i-learned-from-my-conversations"><span>permalink</span></a></h2>
<p>I’ve had several conversations with developers and designers working across the industry for this piece, all with varying experience levels.</p>
<p>I spoke with a developer working in the science industry who told me, “I saw your post on Bluesky about bosses encouraging AI use. Mine does but in a really weird way. We’re supposed to paste code into ChatGPT and have it make suggestions about structure, performance optimisations”</p>
<p>I pressed further and asked if overall this policy is causing problems with the PR processes.</p>
<p>In reference to their boss, “It’s mostly frustrating, because they completely externalise the review to ChatGPT. Sometimes they just paste hundreds of lines into a comment and tell the developer to check it. Especially the juniors hit problems because the code doesn’t work anymore and they have trouble debugging it.”</p>
<p>“If you ask them technical questions it’s very likely you get a ChatGPT response. Not exactly what I expect from a tech lead.”</p>
<p>Immediately, I thought their boss has outsourced their role to ChatGPT, so I asked if that’s the case.</p>
<p>“Sounds about right. Same with interview questions for new candidates and we can see a lot of the conversations because the company shares a single ChatGPT account.”</p>
<p>I asked for further details and they responded, “People learned to use the chats that disappear after a while.”</p>
<p>That’s pretty horrifying, I’ve got to say. Not just some of it, but <em>all of it</em>. Maybe I’m sensitive because I am people’s boss and couldn’t fathom outsourcing my responsibilities to a technology that <a href="https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2023-11-20-large-language-models-pose-risk-science-false-answers-says-oxford-study">often gets things completely wrong</a>.</p>

<p>Let’s move on to another conversation I had with with a team lead in an agency. Something <a href="https://set.studio/">I have a lot of experience with</a>!</p>
<p>“My company is pushing AI tools across the company in branding, copywriting, design, stock photo creation and of course development. They want to be the ‘first AI agency’ and are basically telling us to get on board or you’re not a fit here any longer.”</p>
<p>Pretty harrowing stuff. This isn’t much of a surprise to me though so far because unfortunately, a reasonable portion of agencies will do everything to cut corners on a project to increase profits.</p>
<p>It’s been that way forever and it’s fundamentally why — understandably — organisations don’t trust agencies. A lot of my work is <em>building</em> that trust in the sales process to counter that.</p>
<p>I asked how their agency is currently billing clients and whether it’s retainers or fixed-fees.</p>
<p>“We have production clients who are on an overall fixed fee and monthly retainer clients whose contracts are set by the number of hours they want to buy.”</p>
<p>Seems like a pretty standard agency setup to me. I wanted to dig deeper on the culture though, so I asked, in reference to “<em>…telling us to get on board or you’re not a fit here any longer</em>” is causing fear amongst their colleagues.</p>
<p>They responded, “I would definitely say it’s causing some fear that they aren’t good enough / falling behind if they aren’t using it regularly.”</p>
<p>“The managers like to quote ‘AI won’t replace you, but a developer using AI would’ as a way to motivate certain team members to use the tools”</p>
<p>Sounds more like a threat to me than a motivation. I asked if their managers are effectively threatening to replace people, not on board with AI and if that worries them.</p>
<p>“In a way yeah but I don’t think they could directly get rid of them for that reason, more potentially make it uncomfortable so they’d leave.”</p>
<p>“It’s not a great feeling to have and to be honest, I think it’s a wider worry about the industry as a whole, as I feel a lot of agencies will be jumping on the AI train.”</p>
<p>“…I do worry about some of my team members and the direction of the company overall — I’m struggling to find the same motivation I had 12-18 months ago”</p>

<p>AI use and a culture of encouraging staff to use it isn’t isolated to this one agency. I spoke with a designer at another agency and they said, “Yes I work at a small digital agency and we’re being encouraged to use tools. Not particularly for image generation (outside of ideation or mood-boarding), but more for summaries, research and some copywriting.”</p>
<p>“I was very vocal about it at the beginning and think I managed to get a bit of a reputation for being difficult for my views,  so I’ve yielded a little bit on certain tools, but still [I’m] very clear about what I think is appropriate for clients and almost certainly make sure we disclose when we use it.”</p>
<p>Even though AI tools seemingly aren’t directly used for the creative design output, they’re being used during the creative ideation process which for me, as an agency founder is terrifying, especially with some of the non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) I’ve signed over the years.</p>
<p>I also can’t fathom using AI for copywriting either.</p>

<p>I also spoke with a software engineer for a huge, global retailer whose organisation is conducting a big push to leverage AI. AI has now become a requirement there. I asked if the organisation has provided correspondence that people’s jobs will be at risk if they’re not on board.</p>
<p>“Thankfully I have not seen any wind of it. There is a lot of discussion about how to embrace it [AI] and how we can help the next wave of engineers coming in from colleges to be ready for the transformations that will happen to the way we work.”</p>
<p>“I’m sure as the tech matures and we adopt specific tools organisation-wide, those discussions may happen. Right now we are still piloting different tools and figuring out what does and doesn’t work for the organisation.”</p>
<p>I asked if this was more of a pragmatic process, rather than a rushed, reactive process.</p>
<p>“I think it’s being done with a sense of urgency to embrace new technologies and how they can help us but not to the point where the average engineer would feel overly pressured or threatened by the push.”</p>
<p>“I’ve been enjoying my journey into how to leverage AI but I think for newer engineers or engineers looking to climb the ladder, like myself, it inherently adds pressure to be an earlier adopter and be one to spread knowledge early.”</p>
<p>I asked if there had been any disasters.</p>
<p>“Thankfully nothing in my area and I’m sure any team would try to keep those slip ups under wraps. I will say that in my personal experience little edge case bugs are more prevalent and no matter how careful I am and reread all code over and over I still manage to miss stuff when I don’t manually type it.”</p>
<p>“I’m pretty proud of raising solid PRs with low rates of bugs reported, but these last two sprints, I’ve had a few things slip past me due to the change of workflow. I’m sure this is something a mindful engineer won’t struggle with for long as we adjust to the new way of working.”</p>

<p>Let’s take a look at one more because I’m aware this article is getting <em>very long</em>. Sorry about that.</p>
<p>I had a developer reach out about AI very much being forced in their organisation.</p>
<p>“The CTO at my previous job tried Claude Code and really liked it so he said that all the devs had to use Claude Code in our work for generating code, generating tests, debugging, and validating design.”</p>
<p>“If we asked him a question on something he would tell us to ask Claude first. I never found Claude useful. It couldn’t debug anything and I didn’t like how carefully I’d have to comb through the code it generated to find the subtle bugs it would inject. The design validation was basically just telling us what we wanted to hear, which the CTO loved”</p>
<p>This is the thing about AI tools. They are by design going to honour your prompt, which often results in your AI tool agreeing with you, even if you’re wrong.</p>
<p>I asked this person if their boss was effectively off-loading their responsibilities to AI too. I also asked about more information about design validation.</p>
<p>“He was trying to off-load responsibilities to Claude but Claude never gave us a good answer so it would just add an extra layer of back-and-forth to solving the problem.”</p>
<p>“Design validation is looking for possible performance, security, or concurrency issues in the design of our system. Claude would always have some generic answer that didn’t fit our specific circumstances so it was taken as validation that our design was good”</p>
<p>Again, AI tools will validate you, <em>even if you’re wrong</em>.</p>
<p>“I think the fact that Claude didn’t have anything real to say about our designs was taken as validation that the design was good.”</p>
<p>“There was an assumption that if the design had an issue then Claude would catch that and say something relevant to it. I don’t think he ever considered the possibility that Claude wasn’t saying relevant things because it couldn’t do that. It would only be able to regurgitate generic advice you find on the internet about good software design”</p>
<p>A lot of design critique is based in analytical, creative and soft skills, along with lots of experience. AI is completely incapable of doing all of that.</p>
<p><em>LLM</em> is an acronym for <em>large language model</em> and that is exactly what these tools <em>are</em> — language processing systems. So am I surprised that Claude is just regurgitating generic design advice? No.</p>
<p>These tools are incapable of <em>creating</em> and <em>analysing</em>. They are only capable of pattern matching and regurgitating what has been fed into them during the training process.</p>
<p>Remember when Google’s AI summaries were <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cd11gzejgz4o">encouraging people to add glue to their pizza sauce</a>, for example? Yeh, that was a Reddit joke comment <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Pizza/comments/1a19s0/my_cheese_slides_off_the_pizza_too_easily/">which has now been removed</a> but it’s a good example of AI regurgitating what it has learned without to capability of determining the fact that comment was a <em>joke</em>.</p>
<p>Regurgiting, not creating. It’s what these tools do.</p>
<h2 id="some-advice-for-navigating-all-of-this">Some advice for navigating all of this<a href="#some-advice-for-navigating-all-of-this"><span>permalink</span></a></h2>
<p>I’d say my overarching advice, based on how difficult tech recruitment is right now, is to sadly <em>play along</em>. But — and I cannot stress this enough — make sure you <strong>document everything</strong>.</p>
<p>What I mean by that is <strong>every single time</strong> AI tools cause problems, slow-downs and other disappointing outcomes, document that outcome and who was responsible for that decision. Make sure you document your opposition and professional advice too.</p>
<p>In fact, away from AI, I’d recommend documenting this stuff in general. It’ll be vital if you ever find yourself in a disciplinary and/or tribunal situation. You don’t know where the code your tool spat out <em>came from</em> either. Documenting <em>who is responsible</em> helps to protect you, individually, if litigation is raised against your organisation. If it is not your decision to use these tools, <strong>make that known</strong>, officially.</p>
<p>It’s quite clear we’re in a bubble with AI, or at best, a hype cycle. For example <a href="https://fortune.com/2025/08/18/mit-report-95-percent-generative-ai-pilots-at-companies-failing-cfo/">95% of generative AI pilots failed in a recent report from MIT</a> and even when <a href="https://metr.org/blog/2025-07-10-early-2025-ai-experienced-os-dev-study/">developers thought AI was making them faster, it was actually making them slower in another study</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/04/openai-chatgpt-700-million-users.html">Billions are being poured into this technology</a> but big tech companies — the so-called “magnificent 7” (cringe) — can afford those losses, generally. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ericwbailey.website/post/3lxf4ujam5s2o">Ethics from decision makers are clearly not even a factor any more in these organisations too</a>.</p>
<p>My worry is that — as always — workers will be the ones to suffer as the bubble/hype cycle bursts. What I’m directly advising you to do is <strong>protect your interests right now</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up<a href="#wrapping-up"><span>permalink</span></a></h2>
<p>To everyone who I spoke to and haven’t featured in this article, I’m sorry for excluding your input. This article is <em>very long</em> already. Just know, the conversation we had was incredibly useful in producing this article and I really enjoyed talking to you. Thank you.</p>
<p>This article has been really hard to write, I’m not going to lie. I really enjoyed my conversations but quietly, I was hoping I was wrong with my theory that AI tools were being forced, rather than being used on merit.</p>
<p>It’s so typical of the tech industry to jump on a shiny new thing, completely forgetting how much harm it causes, such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250827031206/https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/raine-vs-openai-et-al-complaint.pdf">ChatGPT teaching someone how to more effectively commit suicide</a> (<em>extreme</em> content warning on that link). Let’s not forget how much content was stolen in the first place — and continues to be “scraped” — to train models too. <a href="https://www.americanbar.org/groups/business_law/resources/business-law-today/2025-february/openai-sued-data-scraping-canada/">Legal cases have rightly been raised</a>.</p>
<p>I would say I’m very much an AI-sceptic. That’s not a position from refusing to try AI tools though. <a href="https://piccalil.li/blog/how-im-using-ai/">We’ve tried these tools for quite a while</a> and after that extended period, found them to be more often than not, a complete hindrance, albeit quite useful in certain contexts. Your mileage may vary though! <a href="https://piccalil.li/blog/our-principles-on-ai/">We know our position</a> and that’s what’s important to us.</p>
<p>Regardless of your opinion of AI, forcing the usage of it is almost certainly going to end in disaster. Just be prepared for that disaster and protect yourself is my overall advice.</p>

												<p>Last month, KrebsOnSecurity tracked the sudden emergence of hundreds of polished online gaming and wagering websites that lure people with free credits and eventually <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/07/scammers-unleash-flood-of-slick-online-gaming-sites/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">abscond with any cryptocurrency funds</a> deposited by players. We’ve since learned that these scam gambling sites have proliferated thanks to a new Russian affiliate program called “<strong>Gambler Panel</strong>” that bills itself as a “soulless project that is made for profit.”</p>
<div id="attachment_72047"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-72047" decoding="async" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/scambler-offer.png" alt="" width="1413" height="717" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/scambler-offer.png 1413w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/scambler-offer-768x390.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/scambler-offer-782x397.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 1413px) 100vw, 1413px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-72047">A machine-translated version of Gambler Panel’s affiliate website.</p></div>
<p>The scam begins with deceptive ads posted on social media that claim the wagering sites are working in partnership with popular athletes or social media personalities. The ads invariably state that by using a supplied “promo code,” interested players can claim a $2,500 credit on the advertised gaming website.</p>
<p>The gaming sites ask visitors to create a free account to claim their $2,500 credit, which they can use to play any number of extremely polished video games that ask users to bet on each action. However, when users try to cash out any “winnings” the gaming site will reject the request and prompt the user to make a “verification deposit” of cryptocurrency — typically around $100 — before any money can be distributed.</p>
<p>Those who deposit cryptocurrency funds are soon pressed into more wagering and making additional deposits. And — shocker alert — all players eventually lose everything they’ve invested in the platform.</p>
<p>The number of scam gambling or “scambling” sites has skyrocketed in the past month, and now we know why: The sites all pull their gaming content and detailed strategies for fleecing players straight from the playbook created by Gambler Panel, a Russian-language affiliate program that promises affiliates up to 70 percent of the profits.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lNjqXIq1s5g?si=-30qS1Bw73VdIXow" width="750" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Gambler Panel’s website gambler-panel[.]com links to a helpful wiki that explains the scam from cradle to grave, offering affiliates advice on how best to entice visitors, keep them gambling, and extract maximum profits from each victim.</p>
<p>“We have a completely self-written from scratch FAKE CASINO engine that has no competitors,” Gambler Panel’s wiki enthuses. “Carefully thought-out casino design in every pixel, a lot of audits, surveys of real people and test traffic floods were conducted, which allowed us to create something that has no doubts about the legitimacy and trustworthiness even for an inveterate gambling addict with many years of experience.”</p>
<p>Gambler Panel explains that the one and only goal of affiliates is to drive traffic to these scambling sites by any and all means possible.</p>
<div id="attachment_72043"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-72043" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/scambler-yourtask.png" alt="" width="749" height="485" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/scambler-yourtask.png 1220w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/scambler-yourtask-768x497.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/scambler-yourtask-782x506.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-72043">A machine-translated portion of Gambler Panel’s singular instruction for affiliates: Drive traffic to these scambling sites by any means available.</p></div>
<p>“Unlike white gambling affiliates, we accept absolutely any type of traffic, regardless of origin, the only limitation is the CIS countries,” the wiki continued, referring to a common prohibition against scamming people in Russia and former Soviet republics in the Commonwealth of Independent States.</p>
<p>The program’s website claims it has more than 20,000 affiliates, who earn a minimum of $10 for each verification deposit. Interested new affiliates must first get approval from the group’s Telegram channel, which currently has around 2,500 active users.</p>
<p>The Gambler Panel channel is replete with images of affiliate panels showing the daily revenue of top affiliates, scantily-clad young women promoting the Gambler logo, and fast cars that top affiliates claimed they bought with their earnings.<span id="more-72027"></span></p>
<div id="attachment_72041"><p><a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/scambler-mainmotives.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-72041" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/scambler-mainmotives.png" alt="" width="750" height="468" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/scambler-mainmotives.png 1266w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/scambler-mainmotives-768x479.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/scambler-mainmotives-782x488.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-72041">A machine-translated version of the wiki for the affiliate program Gambler Panel.</p></div>
<p>The apparent popularity of this scambling niche is a consequence of the program’s ease of use and detailed instructions for successfully reproducing virtually every facet of the scam. Indeed, much of the tutorial focuses on advice and ready-made templates to help even novice affiliates drive traffic via social media websites, particularly on <strong>Instagram</strong> and <strong>TikTok</strong>.</p>
<p>Gambler Panel also walks affiliates through a range of possible responses to questions from users who are trying to withdraw funds from the platform. This section, titled “Rules for working in Live chat,” urges scammers to respond quickly to user requests (1-7 minutes), and includes numerous strategies for keeping the conversation professional and the user on the platform as long as possible.</p>
<div id="attachment_72042"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-72042" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/scambler-livechatrules.png" alt="" width="749" height="467" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/scambler-livechatrules.png 1266w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/scambler-livechatrules-768x479.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/scambler-livechatrules-782x488.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-72042">A machine-translated version of the Gambler Panel’s instructions on managing chat support conversations with users.</p></div>
<p>The connection between Gambler Panel and the explosion in the number of scambling websites was made by a 17-year-old developer who operates multiple Discord servers that have been flooded lately with misleading ads for these sites.</p>
<p>The researcher, who asked to be identified only by the nickname “<strong>Thereallo</strong>,” said Gambler Panel has built a scalable business product for other criminals.</p>
<p>“The wiki is kinda like a ‘how to scam 101’ for criminals written with the clarity you would expect from a legitimate company,” Thereallo said. “It’s clean, has step by step guides, and treats their scam platform like a real product. You could swap out the content, and it could be any documentation for startups.”</p>
<p>“They’ve minimized their own risk — spreading the links on Discord / Facebook / YT Shorts, etc. — and outsourced it to a hungry affiliate network, just like a franchise,” Thereallo wrote in response to questions.</p>
<p>“A centralized platform that can serve over 1,200 domains with a shared user base, IP tracking, and a custom API is not at all a trivial thing to build,” Thereallo said. “It’s a scalable system designed to be a resilient foundation for thousands of disposable scam sites.”</p>
<p>The security firm <strong>Silent Push</strong> has compiled a list of the latest domains associated with the Gambler Panel, <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Gates-of-Olympus-Likely-Casino-Websites-Silent-Push.csv" target="_blank" rel="noopener">available here</a> (.csv).</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Why did books start being divided into chapters? Joshua Barnes reviews Nicholas Dames’ history of literary segmentation, a study that slices through and pauses over what chapters have always told us about the times we live in.</p><!--$--><section data-slice-type="text" data-slice-variation="default"><p>I often return to an essay by Lydia Davis about an unusual experiment in translation. Better known for her work on French writers like Gustave Flaubert, Marcel Proust, and Maurice Blanchot, Davis had in this case tried to translate a literary text, not from French but rather from English into English. The text in question was Laurence Sterne’s unfinished 1768 novel, <em>A Sentimental Journey through France and Italy by Mr. Yorick</em>. Even a glance at its first page suggests why the book might require translation. Here is how it begins:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></section><!--/$--><!--$--><section data-slice-type="poem" data-slice-variation="default"><article><div><p>——They order, said I, this matter better in France—&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—You have been in France? said my gentleman, turning quick upon me with the most civil triumph in the world.—Strange! quoth I, debating the matter with myself, That one and twenty miles sailing, for ’tis absolutely no further from Dover to Calais, should give a man these rights—I’ll look into them: so giving up the argument—I went straight to my lodgings, put up half a dozen shirts and a black pair of silk breeches—‘the coat I have on, said I, looking at the sleeve, will do’—took a place in the Dover stage[.]&nbsp;</p></div></article></section><!--/$--><!--$--><div data-slice-type="text" data-slice-variation="default"><p>Unusual English, to say the least. Davis sought to do two things: to modernise the novel by translating its <em>sui generis </em>language into contemporary English; and to figure out, in the process, what exactly makes it so unusual in the first place. Guiding her translation, however, is a deeper question: Why is it that visual art from ‘the eighteenth century and further back, to the beginning of discovered painting, is readily available, at least in reproduction, and enjoyed by the general public, not just scholars or specialists’ – but <em>not</em> literature ‘before, say, Jane Austen’? Literature from before 1800, Davis notes, is ‘mostly unread, even by writers’, and while many English speakers will learn foreign languages, they do not also try to ‘cross the barrier to James Boswell’s English, or John Donne’s, or further back to Chaucer’s or Beowulf’s’.&nbsp;</p><p>The results of this experiment are perhaps less significant than the theoretical speculation it occasions. Translating across the gulf of historical difference – what we could call ‘temporal translation’ – might actually be difficult because ‘the barrier is something other than the language’: ‘maybe it is the sensibility or the worldview that changes too much, as we travel back in time, for us to understand it, or, if we understand it, to feel any sympathy for it’. Sterne’s novel occupies the unusual and contradictory position of being at once proto-modern (or proto-modernist) and somehow, by this very stylistic prolepsis, archaic or antiquated. It seems to shatter our so-called modern conventions before they were even created.</p><p><em>A Sentimental Journey</em> appears to begin in the middle of a conversation, but it is not exactly clear who is speaking or to whom they speak: dialogue is not clearly set out in quotation marks; dashes of different lengths are used expressively; and, finally, it is not organised according to legible chapters. Flipping through the first fifteen or twenty pages one sees instead repeated chapter titles: ‘Calais’; ‘The Monk | Calais’; ‘The Monk | Calais’ (again); ‘The Monk | Calais’ (once more); ‘The Desobligeant | Calais’; finally and somewhat belatedly, a ‘Preface | In the Desobligeant’; then, three pages later, ‘Calais’ (again). Such irregular chaptering produces an irregular experience of time, hence the comedy of the moment when Sterne’s hero, Yorick, is found rocking his horse-drawn carriage by the ‘agitation of writing a preface’ – a few chapters in.</p><p>Sterne’s indifference to normal chaptering only throws into relief the ordinary and invisible work that chapters do as literary infrastructure. As is so often the case, one only notices a convention when it’s violated. But it is equally true of conventions that they are made; they come from somewhere. Why is it that novels have chapters at all? This is the inquiry of <em>The Chapter: A Segmented History from Antiquity to the Twenty-First Century </em>by Nicholas Dames, a professor of English at Columbia University who specialises in Victorian literature and culture.&nbsp;</p><p>A book on chapters! I know. Stay with me. For this apparently technical question transforms into a historical phenomenology of literary time. In this sense <em>The Chapter </em>continues the inquiry Dames has been carrying out for the past quarter century in his scholarly work – the exploration of what he called, in <em>Amnesiac Selves</em> (2000), the ‘linguistic organization of temporal experience’, borrowing the phrase from the great German historian Reinhart Koselleck. In <em>The Chapter</em>, however, the scope has been radically widened, in part – one suspects – to make sense of the novel’s present fortunes. Dames declared in his previous book, <em>The Physiology of the Novel </em>(2007), the necessity of developing ‘nuanced and even-handed accounts of what I might call <em>the social norms of cognition</em> of given historical moments’, norms that are reproduced in large measure by the norms of writing. Enter the chapter. One of the basic structures of the book, the chapter is a ‘box of time’ that shapes the reader’s experience of temporality. As such, changes in chaptering present one way of exploring changes in the experience of time in literary history. How did time <em>feel</em> in late antiquity, or in fifteenth-century Burgundy, or to a former slave at the end of the eighteenth century? Studying the chapter might also tell us something about our experience of time now, in ‘the present’ – whatever that is – and the historical distance between our time and that of times past.&nbsp;</p></div><!--/$--><!--$--><!--/$--><!--$--><section data-slice-type="text" data-slice-variation="default"><p>Sterne comes up a lot in <em>The Chapter</em>, partly because his experiments in self-consciousness draw attention to the chapter’s conventionality, if only in the breach. In Sterne’s better-known novel <em>The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman </em>(1759-67), for instance, you might catch yourself in volume four thinking you had missed something as chapter twenty-three gives way to chapter twenty-five:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></section><!--/$--><!--$--><section data-slice-type="poem" data-slice-variation="default"><article><div><p>—No doubt, Sir,—there is a whole chapter wanting here—and a chasm of ten pages made in the book by it—but the book-binder is neither a fool, or a knave, or a puppy—nor is the book a jot more imperfect, (at least upon that score)—but, on the contrary, the book is more perfect and complete by wanting the chapter, than having it.&nbsp;</p></div></article></section><!--/$--><!--$--><div data-slice-type="text" data-slice-variation="default"><p>If the book truly is ‘more perfect and complete by wanting the chapter’, that is because <em>Tristram Shandy </em>is a book about failure and errancy, where experiments with form and time are manifold. Notoriously it begins with Tristram’s attempt to narrate his life, but he prevaricates so long that he fails to get to any of the key points of his personal history. The preface again arrives late, in volume two; his birth only occurs in volume four; Tristram’s very name is an error, the intended birth name being Trismegistus. And what better expression of errancy than a gap in the novelistic edifice itself? Sterne also breaks off chapter nine of volume four, as Tristram’s father walks down a flight of stairs, and asks: ‘Is it not a shame to make two chapters out of what passed in going down one pair of stairs?’ There begins a ‘chapter upon chapters’, which Sterne calls ‘the best chapter in my whole work; and take my word, whoever reads it, is as well employed as in picking straws’. Picking straws: the very image of contingency. But with Dames’ theory of the chapter in mind, all this meddling with chapterisation, or capitulation (from the Latin <em>capitulum</em>,<em> </em>meaning ‘little head’), is not simply literary estrangement or satire. Rather it reflects, arguably even theorises, the function of the chapter – the presentation of time as an experience of unified discontinuity.</p><p>Dames illuminates Sterne’s eighteenth-century moment as one in which the novel chapter has lost ‘much of its original function without as yet having acquired a new one’, which makes it properly experimental. But the place of Sterne’s experiments in the history of the chapter belies the fact that Dames’ history is really an attempt to describe the genesis and function of a convention <em>in its very conventionality</em> – not the exceptions, but rather the rule. His attention is directed instead towards the ‘<em>usual </em>chapter and its almost unthinking repetitions of technique’. This is a more ambitious task than it might seem. A chapter is a ubiquitous part of novelistic architecture – so easily overlooked, as Dames notes, that it is difficult even to conceptualise as an object of inquiry. And although the chapter finds its most distinctive uses in the novel, which has the ‘unique ability to […] articulate how the experience of time is the experience of time’s segmentations’, it does not originate there.</p><p>If the enormous scope of this book invites comparisons with Erich Auerbach, then so too does its method, which similarly offers densely suggestive examples rather than an exhaustive historical inventory. Unlike Auerbach, however, Dames’ organisation of his material tends towards the taxonomic and schematising. He offers eight views of the chapter performing different functions at different historical moments: there is the ‘threshold’ of the classical heading, the ‘abstract syncopation’ of the Gospels, the ‘cut’ and ‘fade’ of medieval prose narratives – and so on, down to the ‘post chapter’ present. This is a longstanding ‘taxonomical urge’, as Dames termed it at the beginning of <em>Amnesiac Selves</em>, a habit that he picked up from his objects of study. Victorian theories of mind such as phrenology, for all their notorious problems, nonetheless ‘provided […] a useful interpretive model’ – in permitting its division ‘into distinct parts’, they rendered a newly ‘spatialized’ and ‘diagrammatic’ mind that was more susceptible of analysis. But in <em>The Chapter</em> there is perhaps a tension between the comprehensive ambitions of this ‘taxonomic urge’, and the suggestive but partial moments of Auerbachian literary history. You could say that the book makes a methodological wager that the nearly scientific goal of taxonomy – to encompass everything – can effectively be grafted onto an historicist hermeneutics constantly shifting its focus from part to whole and back again.</p></div><!--/$--><!--$--><!--/$--><!--$--><div data-slice-type="text" data-slice-variation="default"><p>We begin in the second century BCE, with a tablet, known today as the Tabula Bembina, upon which are inscribed some Roman anti-corruption laws from the time of the Gracchi. This was a ‘public, technical matter, by no means literary’, but for Dames it captures the chapter’s characteristic early function – as a technology not of narrative, but of reference – that would eventually be imported into the codex. On the tablet, ablative Latin phrases designate the topics covered in the relevant sections (<em>de nomine deferundo iduibusque legundeis</em> or ‘concerning prosecution and the choosing of juries,’ for instance). At once ‘visual and analytic’, these create a sort of resting place for the eye, and they organise the information presented into a logical and navigable form.</p><p>But we are still very much in the realm of the heading; the tablet is a source of <em>information</em>. Jumping forward three centuries to the second century CE and to the work of the grammarian Aulus Gellius, Dames observes a new breadth in the headings of Gellius’s miscellany, <em>Attic Nights</em>, ranging from brief summary to something more authorial than a legal finding-aid: ‘How Publius Nigidius with great cleverness showed that words are not arbitrary, but natural.’ Yet a text like <em>Attic Nights</em> is still only something to be consulted partially, and on occasion, rather than read and absorbed line-by-line: ‘The text is not an experience’, but rather a ‘storage place from which information is extracted; the condensed summary is not only possible, but desirable’. However, one can begin to see the line of transmission; those ablative phrases of the Tabula Bembina are a precursor to the summative chapter headings of a novel like Charlotte Lennox’s <em>Female Quixote </em>(1752): ‘In which will be found one of the former Mistakes pursued, and another cleared up, to the great Satisfaction of Two Persons; among whom, the Reader, we expect, will make a Third.’ And so, from the tablet, the chapter begins the migration it will be Dames’ project to track: out of its originary informational context and, slowly but surely, into the temporality of the novel.</p><p>Before the migration is complete, though, we have a centuries-long period of terminological and conceptual confusion as various terms, referring to both the textual unit and its title, are used: <em>capitulum</em>, <em>kephalaia</em> (‘head’), <em>titlos</em> (‘title’), <em>argumentum </em>and <em>breviculus</em> (summaries used to aid the inspection of a text) – these terms are all tangled together. One of the most inspired interpretations of this conceptual history is Dames’ rereading of the <em>Confessions </em>by the fourth-century theologian Augustine. Amid a spiritual crisis, Augustine overhears some nearby children crying ‘take it and read’, and, turning to a random section of the Bible, resolves to read ‘the first chapter [<em>capitulum</em>] I might find’. This is pivotal in converting Augustine to Christianity, for his eyes fall upon what a modern reader of the Bible might know as Romans 13:13-14, a caution against revelry that urges one away from ‘rioting and drunkenness’, exhorting instead that its reader ‘put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to <em>fulfil </em>the lusts <em>thereof</em>’. Or at least, that is how it reads in the Oxford edition of the King James Bible I have just taken down from my shelf (slightly hungover, I confess, and thus moved and gently interpellated by its message), navigating with relative ease to Romans 13. But this was not Augustine’s experience, for his Bible had no chapters; his <em>capitulum </em>refers to the general ‘head’ or topic of the passage. The meaningful unit discloses itself ‘out of an unmarked stream’.&nbsp;</p><p>The organisation of the Bible into ‘chapter and verse’ dates from well after Augustine’s time – chapters in the thirteenth century, and verses in the sixteenth – and though this format has to a large degree been naturalised by convention, it was not for this reason free of controversy. Early modern intellectuals like Robert Boyle and John Locke would even rail against Biblical chaptering: Boyle complained of its ‘inconvenient Distinction’, which ‘hath sometimes Sever’d Matters that should have been left United’; Locke for his part despaired that the system of chapter-and-verse left scripture ‘so chop’d and minc’d […] so broken and divided’ that not only do the ‘Common People take the Verses usually for distinct aphorisms’, but even the educated have their powers of memory enfeebled. Yet not even the complaints of Boyle and Locke could overturn the chapter’s ‘embeddedness in biblical textual tradition specifically and literate culture generally’. (To this ‘antichapter’ tradition we might add Donald Trump, who, when asked during an interview in 2015 to name a favourite bit of scripture, replied: ‘The Bible means a lot to me, but I don’t want to get into specifics.’)</p><p>Christian scripture is a key site of this transformation of the classical heading, indexing discrete topics in a text, into something whose purpose is story-driven and temporal. The Gospels are, after all, narratives, demanding ‘a new method’ for their organisation. Surveying six competing divisions of the Gospels across ten centuries, Dames describes a project of ‘containerization’ in which the chapter becomes capable of holding a wider variety of topics without being ‘tailored’ to the shape of its content. But it is in the late twelfth century that the ‘modern’ system of Biblical chaptering is inaugurated. Usually associated with the medieval Paris Bible, the origins of this chapter system have long been tied to the work of the English theologian Stephen Langton (c. 1150-1228), who sought more accurate methods of citation for the university classroom. Despite the fact that not all that much evidence binds Langton to the creation of this chaptering technique, this historical account has long been the dominant one: ‘a creative and practical-minded English churchman, steeped in the chaotic environment of a cosmopolitan academy, takes on the chaptering of the Bible’ to improve his pedagogy. This story, however, has been challenged by the discovery of the earlier Saint Albans Bible (1180), named for the Hertfordshire abbey where it was produced, which contains Hebrew calligraphy and thus suggests the possibility not only of a Jewish scribe, but also perhaps an immersion in medieval rabbinical practices. In this view, the objective of the chapter was not scholarly and citational but monastic and oriented towards ‘communal reading tied to a ritualized calendar’. Whether first conceived for the ‘classroom or the chapel’, what Dames calls – in the spirit of historiographic compromise – the ‘Langton-Saint Albans model’ of chaptering affords a new experience: the ‘private continuous reading of narrative texts,’ the glorious fact of silent reading.</p><p>Of course, a whole host of other transformations were needed to make such reading possible: the scroll is first divided into the codex; ancient continuous script is split into discrete words, which are themselves separated uniformly into paragraphs only in the early modern period. Transformations like these are usually treated by book historians as a ‘Babel allegory’, as Dames put it in <em>The Physiology of the Novel</em>, where the historical development of the book as a technology is told as the story of its fragmentation into smaller and smaller parts (which is often a narrative of progress, too: smaller units make reading more accessible and democratic). <em>The Chapter</em> takes this story of fragmentation one step further: part of Dames’ interest is motivated by the chapter’s final <em>dematerialisation</em> and its lingering power as metaphor. The chapter has ‘become a metalanguage’ that describes the different rhythms of social life, from clock time to the lived cadences of the body. One speaks of a new chapter in one’s life – not a new paragraph or a new sentence or, indeed, a new clause. But: ‘If it still works for us this way,’ Dames asks, ‘for how much longer?’ Here, we might be prompted to ask: who in fact is left in this <em>us</em>? Viewed in the less generous glare of media history, and from the perspective of a present less and less oriented towards reading of any kind, the answer is doubtful. If the members of an increasingly postliterate society still measure out their lives in chapters, this may only be a matter of mere habit or convention – in the way that a car’s engine capacity continues to be measured in horsepower.</p></div><!--/$--><!--$--><!--/$--><!--$--><div data-slice-type="text" data-slice-variation="default"><p>Perhaps it is the inevitable fate of any convention, but literary history does not, it turns out, have many examples of people appreciating great chaptering. In <em>The History of English Prose Rhythm</em> (1912) – one of the sources for James Joyce’s virtuosic-or-unreadable parodies of the evolution of English prose in <em>Ulysses</em> – George Saintsbury remarks on Thomas Malory’s decision to insert a chapter break at a decisive moment in his fifteenth-century <em>Morte d’Arthur</em>. At the end of chapter ten of the <em>Morte</em>, Lancelot rides into a castle, having slayed its gatekeeper, only to hear from the castle’s residents ‘in doors and windows that said “Fair Knight: thou art unhappy.”’ Saintsbury praises Malory’s sense of timing here. The chapter break introduces a pause, leaving those words, as Dames puts it, ‘hovering in the air’. The next chapter begins with Lancelot successfully freeing captives from the prison; as such, the chapter has served to elongate the narrative incident and heighten the tension.</p><p>The only problem is that this was not Malory’s division, but rather one added by the printer William Caxton (c.1422-92). This fact was only discovered in 1934 when an edition of the <em>Morte </em>predating Caxton was discovered at Winchester College. As it turns out, the Winchester version had no chapters. The modulations of time are the work of Caxton’s specific ‘remediation’. He creates an ‘artful segmentation, a resonant silence, in the printed volume’s visual patterning’. Caxton is paired in this chapter of <em>The Chapter</em> with the anonymous fifteenth-century remediators who transformed Chrétien de Troyes’s great twelfth-century Arthurian verse into prose. Unlike Caxton’s their results are not acclaimed; like the authors of movie novelisations today, they are vulgarisers, profaning the sacred bonds between form and content. In their hands, Chrétien’s flowing verse – praised in <em>Mimesis </em>by Auerbach as ‘light and almost easy’ – is not only segmented with red ink, but also crowded with insistent explanations in the register of narrative history (‘How the king kissed Enide’). Again, in the manner of movie novelisers, moments of introspection are reduced while battle sequences are dilated with a vigour that may equally be judged ‘clumsy technique’ or ‘daring maneuver’.<em> </em>More charitably, we might say these remediators practise what Dames calls, after Roman Jakobson, ‘intralingual translation’ – a phrase that calls back to mind (there it is again!) Davis’ experiment with Sterne. Like Davis, the remediators are working across an historical gap between time-feelings, transforming the internal temporality of Chrétien’s verse to fit their own prosaic times. Dames speculates on the reasons for this transformation. Could it be that the new and uncertain ruling clique in Burgundy – ‘freshly arrived at what would be its historical apex’ – preferred these ‘modes of intense now-time’ to the subtle continuities of Chrétien’s verse? Admitting the possibility of such an ‘ideological effect’, Dames also notes that it is equally likely that these ‘new temporalities’ were simply an ‘accident’.&nbsp;</p><p>Here one notices a difference between Dames’ previous books and <em>The Chapter</em>, whose broader subject matter perhaps helped it to become a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award. As brilliant works of literary history, <em>Amnesiac Selves </em>and <em>The Physiology of the Novel </em>both have the density of specialist knowledge and the sensitivity of immersive textual studies. Each book reconstructs a forgotten discourse: the first book reassembles the understanding of memory in the Victorian period, as explored through close readings of key Victorian novelists and scientific writers; the second builds on this interest by turning to the forgotten paradigm of ‘physiological’ novel theory and its exemplars, the philosopher-scientist-critics GH Lewes, ES Dallas, and Alexander Bain, who explored the embodied rhythms of reading. The physiological basis for a literary theory of form was ultimately swept away by more abstract formalisms espoused, on the one hand, by Henry James and his acolyte Percy Lubbock, and, on the other, by the practico-critical poetics of IA Richards (who effectively banished the novel from the classroom). Though Dames’ close readings in <em>The Chapter </em>are no less attentive and sinuous than in these earlier books, they are perforce more limited by the widened scope. I don’t intend to downplay the brilliance of Dames as a reader of individual texts or as a literary historian. However, as the study twists and turns, the density of historical detail together with the vast scope can at times induce a kind of mental torsion, with the dual impulses to historicise and taxonomise pulling in different directions.</p><p>In any case, the taxonomic conclusion Dames draws from the Burgundian remediators of Chrétien is that while their clumsy cuts are just that – cuts in a continuous weave – Caxton’s interventions are more like the ‘fade’, offering ‘aeration’ to the narrative text. In this respect Caxton’s edits are oriented not towards reference, but ‘narrative progression and rhythm’. The paradoxical outcome of this intervention is to unify Malory’s text precisely by dividing it; the <em>Morte </em>now comprises ‘semi-discrete moments in a single process, rather than entirely different moments’. Unification-through-division of this sort highlights two logics of narrative time: discontinuous and immersive reading. Chaptering itself comes to generate a ‘feeling of presentness’ by adding white space, a species of visual fermata between narrative actions – ‘emptiness [with] a temporal intensity.’</p><p>In their evocation of ‘presentness’, blank intensities of this kind recall a much longer-running theological dispute – between Augustine and the great English theologian Bede – on the divisibility of time. Where, after all, is the present? For Augustine, it is impossible to isolate something like ‘presentness’, for it is composed – as he put it in the <em>Confessions </em>– of ‘fugitive moments’, suspended in the future or always being sucked away into the past. The present is thus not measurable by a distinctive unit. Bede, in his eighth-century work <em>The Reckoning of Time</em>, argued to the contrary that there is a ‘minimal’ or ‘atomic’ unit of time. He made his case through a thought experiment. Say you are just about to be punched in the face. As a reflex, you flinch and close your eyes. Between these two moments – that ‘tiniest interval of time in which the lids of our eyes move when a blow is launched’ – is where ‘Bede’s present’ may be found: the atomic unit of presentness. Dames’ point is not that this theological argument directly influenced Caxton and the Burgundian <em>prosateurs</em>, but rather that the disagreement between the two great theologians reflects different investments in literary forms and their relationships to subjectivity in time. For Augustine a poem ‘held entire’ in the mind of a reciter approximates divine omniscience; for Bede, meanwhile, the atomic present is best accessed via a ‘punctuated continuity and directionality’ that might just be the hallmark of well-divided prose – consequently it is ‘seriality, not the transcendence of seriality, [that] is our access to the divine’. It is only in interrupting the present that we are able to perceive it.</p><p>But it is left to the early novel (as an historian of the form, Dames is candid about this bias) to develop fully the space between Augustine’s durationless void and Bede’s serial present. Leaping forward another two hundred-odd years, then, Dames shows this binary of discontinuous and immersive reading exploding into an array of conceptual possibilities. ‘The eighteenth-century synthesis’, as Dames calls it, spans the period from the picaresque to the first flourishing of the English novel in the middle of the eighteenth century, with the antics of Sterne and Henry Fielding. Functions inherited from older reference-based chapters are here experimentally set in tension with the narrative innovations first explored in the fifteenth-century remediations: the eighteenth-century chapter struggles with the relationship between the strange and the commonplace, the ‘striking and singular’ and the ‘categorizable’. Hence the initial distinction between discontinuous and immersive reading turns out to contain other oppositions that structure it in turn: between space and time; and between the time narrated and the time it takes <em>to </em>narrate or read.</p><p>Figuring all this is that moment on the staircase from the middle of <em>Tristram Shandy</em>, a kind of novelistic freezeframe, in which Sterne fixes Walter Shandy in place to reflect upon chaptering. In Dames’ account, this metachapter makes explicit the chapter’s full conceptual field: it has a direct address; it narrates both an incident and an interruption. What stands out as the real ‘heart’ of the metachapter is the staircase itself, which serves as a kind of symbolic definition of the chapter’s function. The staircase ‘captures the chapter’s double chronometry, that tension expressed by the simultaneous binaries of space versus time and narrated versus narrating times’. Fielding famously compared his chapters to inns along the road of a long journey, where the reader may ‘stop and take a glass’, but Dames thinks the staircase a better figure. Fielding’s coach trip is merely ‘linear, starting and stopping’; Sterne’s staircase, on the other hand, ‘unpacks two complementary but opposed dimensions’. Walter and Toby head down the stairs, troping narrative progress, while at the same time the sequence of steps and landings displays the segmentation of linearity ‘into discrete stages’. Sterne’s novel is a kind of ‘funhouse mirror’ of temporality: instead of proceeding steadily along a horizontal axis, our temporal schema is thrown down the stairs.</p><p>Later, in what JGA Pocock once called the ‘second eighteenth century’, the so-called Age of Revolutions, the chapter mutates again. Now ‘elongated’, the chapter is studied in two works that each seem in different ways to dissolve its earlier functions. In <em>The Interesting Narrative of Olaudah Equiano </em>(1789), the famous autobiography of a Nigerian slave who eventually regained his freedom and lived in Britain, Dames observes a mismatch between the protocols of chaptering and the life that these protocols divide up. Equiano’s chapters offer extensive summaries in the manner of a picaresque novel, but seem at the same time to show the inefficacy of that paratextual structure for capturing the experience of domination and eventual manumission. ‘How then to describe the chapter in Equiano, or more bluntly, why bother to do so?’ It is perhaps relevant precisely <em>because </em>the apparent orderliness of chaptering – its ability meaningfully to sculpt time – is shown, against the absolute alienation of slavery, to be unfit for its usual purpose of segmentation. Thus, the intensively expository chapter summaries of the <em>Narrative </em>not only fail to coordinate with the abbreviated summaries in the table of contents, but they also introduce chapters of far greater length (on average, Dames tells us, these are 6,500 words: up to four times longer than is typical for this period). So, then, what is the <em>meaning </em>of this technical decision? ‘To say,’ Dames writes, coming perilously close to ventriloquising Equiano, ‘a life cannot be measured this way, not this kind of life.’</p><p>As the self-testimony of a former slave, published in the same year as the storming of the Bastille, Equiano’s <em>Narrative </em>is certainly a sign of the times. It is perhaps as iconic a testament to the ‘new epoch’ of the nineteenth century as Girodet’s <a target="_blank" href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Depute-jean-baptiste_belley-492-688.jpg" rel="noreferrer">portrait</a> of Jean-Baptiste Belley, a former slave from Saint-Domingue who would eventually be elected to the French National Convention. ‘New epoch’: this is the legendary, and perhaps apocryphal, phrase of Goethe, uttered in response to the defeat of the Prussians at Valmy in 1792. ‘From this place and from this day a new epoch in world history begins and you can say you were there to see it.’ We might observe that he, for one, did not reach here for the metaphor of the chapter – too ‘partial, fleeting, unhistorical’, according to Dames, to register this period’s epochal shifts. In Goethe’s <em>Wilhem Meister’s Apprenticeship </em>(1795-96),<em> </em>for instance, the chapter becomes even more elongated (one of them is 20,000 words!), doubling in size in the novel’s second half, which was composed after Valmy. <em>Wilhem Meister’s Apprenticeship</em> is a ‘triple turning point’, tying together ‘a world-historical transition, a maturational transition’, and a ‘career transition’ as Goethe, now older and on the other side of the revolution, has to produce fresh material rather than merely revising old writing. It is the very incongruity and ‘dilation’ of the chapter that ‘itself is historical’. Jane Austen’s career is also adduced as an example of the eighteenth century’s passing into the nineteenth, with the three youthful novels drafted in the 1790s averaging chapter lengths of around 2,000 words, while the ‘mature’ novels of the 1810s are nearer 3,500.</p><p>However sceptical we might like to be about periodisation, and nasty but inevitable grand narratives, it’s observable that history has, well, happened; historical experience makes ‘norms’ normal, and it is potentially why – to return to Davis’ question with which I began – more people still read Austen for pleasure than Smollett, Fielding, Defoe, or, um, John Bunyan. Not unrelatedly, I recently invited some students to read paragraphs from the fourteenth, fifteenth, sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries (respectively, Margery Kempe, Edmund Spenser, Margaret Cavendish, Eliza Haywood, and Sterne: I welcome criticisms of my selections) and one of them said, in so many words, ‘Perhaps some things are forgotten for a reason.’ Perhaps. But we might also wonder: to what extent do novels instruct their readers in how to think, feel, and act?&nbsp;</p><p>This has been one of the questions that Dames has posed most insistently across his career, with a special emphasis on the contributions of the Victorian novel to readerly subjectivity. At the end of <em>Amnesiac Selves</em>,<em> </em>he speculates on the way that Victorian fiction <em>inculcates </em>a special kind of nostalgia – its warm selective memory is the flipside of the alienating nausea of the historical difference that makes you want to throw a book out the window (or, in homage to Sterne, down the stairs). Yet, as Dames noted then, the cultural prestige of Victorian fiction is ‘increasingly seen in an elegiac manner, as a strange fact that, as the twenty-first century begins, will not last much longer’. As the nineteenth century disappears further and further from view, ‘the Victorians will eventually, if belatedly, make Victorian fiction stranger and less attractive’. Since the publication of <em>Amnesiac Selves</em> in 2000, the Victorians have only receded further away from us in time.</p></div><!--/$--><!--$--><!--/$--><!--$--><div data-slice-type="text" data-slice-variation="default"><p>It was the Victorian novel that made the chapter seem natural. Key to the reality effects of nineteenth-century British fiction is its synchronisation of novel time with the natural rhythms of life. As a result, novelistic chapters lose their theatrics, their posturing and posing, even those unstable amalgamations surveyed in Equiano and Goethe, and instead become regular and ‘tacit’, receding into the background. It is this very tacitness that secures the permanence of the chapter as a blank, unmarked, and ordinary vehicle for reflection. Surveying Tolstoy’s <em>War and Peace </em>(1867), Dames distils the repertoire of the chapter into another taxonomy of five key functions: the signal or incantation; the crossing of a threshold; the ‘suspended revelation’; the ‘tense use’, which adjusts the temporal frame of narration; and the modulation of point of view. Together with Elizabeth Gaskell – whose <em>Wives and Daughters </em>(1864-66) is shown virtuosically to assemble all five of these ‘tacit’ operations, in a careful and naturalistic counterpart to the brazen theatrics of Sterne – the chaptering of Tolstoy presents a study in indistinctness.</p><p>Perhaps the most ‘natural’ scheme for novelistic time is that of the day itself, which is what Dames shows to be at work in Charles Dickens and George Eliot, calling this the ‘suturing of story world and reader […] an alignment of times, a synchronization of light’. Epic heroes lived in a time supercharged with meaning – the time of <em>kairos</em>, or propitious instant of action,<em> </em>not the dun-coloured <em>chronos</em>, the everyday time of housework, care work, and all the other kinds of work. In contrast with epic, then, the diurnal frame of novelistic realism appears definitively chronological and quotidian – but it is, of course, a complex literary artefact, one that Dames explores using some old-fashioned counting. There are 146 narrated days in <em>Middlemarch</em>, though the novel covers some 1,000 days. That means around 15% of the total ‘days of our lives’ are narrated; of <em>these</em>, only 18 ‘peak days’ are extended over two chapters. If, in the time of Goethe and Equiano, the coordinates of day, chapter, and epoch fell helplessly out of joint – the chapter form desynchronised from life by historical forms of dislocation – it is the innovation of Eliot’s realism to realign life with text: ‘Neither wholly impersonal and public like the “day” nor intimately personal like the epoch, chapter time is, perhaps, something like an image of <em>weak collective time</em>’.&nbsp;</p><p>Weakness is an important term, capturing the chapter’s ignorable yet undeniable presence – just like time itself – which is nonetheless experienced collectively. It also calls to my mind Walter Benjamin’s famous evocation of the ‘weak messianic power’, the spark of redemption glowing however faintly in the present. There is something of that melancholia in this history too. As Dames wonders, ‘When you share time, what is it you share?’ A book? A memory? A moment? Or perhaps one shares nothing, for the whole point of fiction is that it is invented, nonactual, negative. The reader of a novel, as Benjamin put it, ‘is isolated, more so than any other reader’. Reading of fictional lives becomes a way of experiencing death before it happens to you: the characters in a novel make its reader ‘understand that death is already waiting for them’. In novelistic time, therefore, one feels in the fate of fictional beings the ‘warmth which we never draw from our own fate’.&nbsp;</p><p>If chapters become, by the twentieth century, simply ‘embarrassing’, subject to two equal but opposing modernist processes – autonomisation (à la Joyce’s almost freestanding stylistic excursions) or decimation (as in Samuel Beckett where it is obviated entirely) – these new formal strategies do not get around the fundamental matter of finitude that is immanent to the chapter as a vehicle of time. A key transitional figure here is the Brazilian novelist Joachim Maria Machado de Assis, whose experimental fiction of the late nineteenth century seems to repudiate the tacit chaptering of realism in favour of something more akin to Sterne. Yet in Machado’s hands, the ‘Shandean chapter’ is no longer free-wheeling and free-associative, but decisively bound: if Tristram struggled to bring forth the story of his birth, the eponymous narrator of <em>The Posthumous Memoirs of Brás Cubas</em> (1881) is already dead. Speaking from beyond the grave in radically attenuated chapters, Brás Cubas adds a new note of disillusionment and pessimism that Dames calls ‘antique-diminutive’.</p><p>The diminution – decline? – of the chapter continues in twentieth-century avant-garde fiction and film: <em>The Unfortunates </em>(1969), by the British novelist BS Johnson, is not bound in a codex but rather packaged up as so many loose sheets in a box, becoming as a result a literal ‘box of time’. Consider, too, the ‘antique’ and self-conscious quality of the onscreen chapters in Agnès Varda’s film <em>Cléo from 5 to 7</em> (1962), tracking its protagonist minute by minute as she awaits the results of a cancer test. For all their apparently lively experimentalism, all three of these cases finally return to the negativity that attends the ‘linguistic organization of temporality’. Machado’s novel is narrated by a dead man; Johnson’s book in a box<em> </em>is <em>about</em> a dead man; Varda’s Cléo receives omens of death: these are texts ‘by, for and about the dead or dying’. Dames refers to these as expressing the ‘poignancy of sequence’, a term that names ‘<em>the sensation of an end indefinitely, but only temporarily, held off</em>’. This finally is ‘a melancholy purpose: to keep something going – a life, a form, a moment – just a little longer’. The chapter, then, not as inns on a journey, but halting steps towards the end.</p></div><!--/$--><!--$--><!--/$--><!--$--><div data-slice-type="text" data-slice-variation="default"><p>Right at the beginning of the book, Dames recalls the remark of a ‘gifted analyst’ some years ago: ‘You’re starting a new chapter.’ Dames writes that this comment made him feel – quoting the psychoanalyst Donald Winnicott – ‘held’. It also spurred the research and writing of this book. Although his analyst’s offhand ‘novelization’ of his life seemed perfectly to capture the subjective experience of temporal passage, Dames could not explain why it had this comforting effect on him. Despite being a ‘novel reader,’ he ‘had no idea why chapters existed – a historical question – nor what exactly they did to our sense of time, a theoretical question’. Guided by these questions, his journey backwards in time terminates in the continuous present with the novels of Uwe Johnson, Jennifer Egan and László Krasznahorkai. There is a chapter in Egan’s novel <em>A Visit From the Goon Squad</em> (2010) that is presented in the form of a PowerPoint presentation on ‘Great Rock and Roll Pauses’. This is a ‘chapter on chapters,’ Dames notes, in the manner of Sterne but relocated into a wholly changed technological environment. These slides – presented in the novel by a twelve-year-old girl named Alison about her family – represent for Dames an effort to ‘understand the feeling of time passing, a feeling that is shaped by media’. If the project of <em>The Chapter </em>has been to coordinate the feeling of time passing with the changing mediations of that feeling, then it is perhaps unsurprising that one of the prevailing feelings in this study in turn is its melancholia, its very nearly depressive turns towards the experience of temporal passage.</p><p>It is also significant, I think, that a history concerned with the objective features of literary history has an important but just-visible subjective dimension – significant, that is, that the book began on the couch in analysis. I was struck, reading <em>The Chapter</em>, by its minimal but insistent evocations of finitude. This is a history of the novel that is partly a history of its death. In this respect it complements Dames’ other books that have told this story from a different angle, as when, in <em>The Physiology of the Novel</em>, he writes of George Gissing’s ‘depressive’ and ‘ambivalent’ relation to the novel form in an era of speed reading. ‘In many ways,’ Dames adds, ‘that depressive position has lingered for readers, writers, and critics of novels, to our own day.’ It has – and it perhaps accounts for the alternatingly depressive and wistful tenor of <em>The Chapter</em>, which reconstructs its object from the position of its catastrophic obsolescence. But Dames is not moralising about the decline of the novel or of the reading public. The conclusion of the study refuses any of what he has termed ‘the morality of attention’, remarking that even if the chapter is dispersed across ‘different media that weave in and out of the format of the book, [it] can express the disjuncture of time itself’ – the ‘disjuncture’, that is, between ‘our’ lives and any of the ‘rhythms – biological, cultural-economic, political, planetary – we live among but cannot manipulate’.</p><p>Yet I think this argument must be evaluated in light of the earlier claim in <em>The Physiology of the Novel</em> that one of the vulnerabilities of Victorian physiological theory was its transformation of readers and texts into technologies: ‘The more its findings turned both novel and reader into machines, the less necessary (or, for that matter, interesting) its procedures seemed, and the more ancillary to other technologies the novel became – a melancholy conclusion that cut short some of the theoretical innovations that the theory had promised.’ If in <em>The Physiology of the Novel</em> Dames was ‘implicitly arguing for the viability of an updated, historically aware version’ of nineteenth-century physiological theories of reading, then <em>The Chapter </em>strikes me as a now-explicit attempt to realise such a theory. In it, Victorian novels stand as the apex of a kind of felt and intuitive ‘chronocommunity’ in which picking up a triple-decker was a reliable way to plug into the interface of temporality that everyone shared. That now is perhaps lost, and the historian’s effort at understanding the genesis of a technical object like the novelistic chapter could be seen as some small recompense – for the lost ‘weak collectivity’ of an earlier period, but maybe, too, for the fearful lack at the centre of all reading. It is difficult not to think of this in Dames’ closing evocation of the chapter’s dispersal across the mediascape. That is, the ‘technical’ question of <em>The Chapter </em>serves to absorb a more basic anxiety: not only about the demise of the novel, but rather about the emptiness at the heart of reading itself.</p><p>I think here of Maurice Blanchot’s essay ‘Literature and the Right to Death’ (1949) – translated, as it happens, by Davis, albeit in a more traditional manner – in which Blanchot writes of finitude as the inescapable meaning of literature. Language kills, and literary language most of all: ‘Language can only begin with the void,’ he writes, ‘no fullness, no certainty can ever speak; something essential is lacking in anyone who expresses himself.’ Questions like ‘What is literature?’ have received ‘only meaningless answers’ insofar as they fail directly to confront this negativity. ‘People can and do ask, “What is poetry?” “What is art? And even “What is the novel?”’ – but for Blanchot it is in the ineradicable ‘emptiness present in all these serious things’ that the impossible centre of literature consists, that empty heart ‘to which reflection, with its own gravity, cannot direct itself without losing its seriousness’.&nbsp;</p><p>Another way of saying this is that <em>The Chapter </em>seems to me most fully to grasp its subject not when it considers the historical or technical question of chaptering, but when it turns from this to the lived experience of time, in which the collapse of literature as such figures the collapse of everything else. Perhaps the function of ‘the chapter’ in <em>The Chapter</em> is not so much a ‘point of departure’ as Auerbach once imagined it – in his phrase, a ‘handle […] by which the subject can be seized’ – but rather a point of return: an obsession, an <em>idée fixe</em>, or, in a more Freudian vocabulary, a reaction formation to the anxiety attending time’s ceaseless passage. Viewed in this gloomy half-light, it is possible to see how the most moving parts of <em>The Chapter </em>are those rarer moments in the subjective register that look right into the void at the centre of literary experience. It is, after all, to escape this emptiness that we write in the first place, even as the act of doing so can only return us to it.</p></div><!--/$--></div></div>]]></description>

<p><a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2519179122">Published</a> in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the study by <a href="https://lafollette.wisc.edu/people/pifarre-i-arolas-hector/">Héctor Pifarré i Arolas</a> of the La Follette School of Public Affairs, José Andrade of the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research, and Carlo Giovanni Camarda of the Institut national d’études démographiques analyzed life expectancy for 23 high-income and low-mortality countries using data from the Human Mortality Database and six different mortality forecasting methods.</p>
<figure id="attachment_4250" aria-label="Assistant Professor Héctor Pifarré i Arolas"><img decoding="async" src="https://lafollette.wisc.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/1713/2022/08/pifarre-arolas-hector-300x300.png" alt="Portrait of Héctor Pifarré i Arolas, Assistant Professor of Public Affairs" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://lafollette.wisc.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/1713/2022/08/pifarre-arolas-hector-300x300.png 300w, https://lafollette.wisc.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/1713/2022/08/pifarre-arolas-hector-150x150.png 150w, https://lafollette.wisc.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/1713/2022/08/pifarre-arolas-hector.png 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"><figcaption>Assistant Professor Héctor Pifarré i Arolas</figcaption></figure>
<p>“The unprecedented increase in life expectancy we achieved in the first half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century appears to be a phenomenon we are unlikely to achieve again in the foreseeable future,” according to Pifarré i Arolas. “In the absence of any major breakthroughs that significantly extend human life, life expectancy would still not match the rapid increases seen in the early 20th century even if adult survival improved twice as fast as we predict.”</p>
<p>From 1900 to 1938, life expectancy rose by about five and a half months with each new generation. The life expectancy for an individual born in a high-income country in 1900 was an average of 62 years. For someone born just 38 years later in similar conditions, life expectancy had jumped to 80 years on average.</p>
<p>For those born between 1939 and 2000, the increase slowed to roughly two and a half to three and a half months per generation, depending on the forecasting method. Mortality forecasting methods are statistical techniques that make informed predictions about future lifespans based on past and current mortality information. These models enabled the research team to estimate how life expectancy will develop under a variety of plausible future scenarios.</p>

<p>“We forecast that those born in 1980 will not live to be 100 on average, and none of the cohorts in our study will reach this milestone. This decline is largely due to the fact that past surges in longevity were driven by remarkable improvements in survival at very young ages,” according to corresponding author Andrade.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the 20th century, infant mortality fell rapidly due to medical advances and other improvements in quality of life for high-income countries. This contributed significantly to the rapid increase in life expectancy. However, infant and child mortality are now so low that the forecasted improvements in mortality in older age groups will not be enough to sustain the previous pace of longevity gains.</p>
<p>While mortality forecasts can never be certain as the future may unfold in unexpected ways – by way of pandemics, new medical treatments or other unforeseen societal changes – this study provides critical insight for governments looking to anticipate the needs of their healthcare systems, pension planning and social policies.</p>
<p>Although a population-level analysis, this research also has implications for individuals, as life expectancy influences personal decisions about saving, retirement and long-term planning. If life expectancy increases more slowly as this study shows is likely, both governments and individuals may need to recalibrate their expectations for the future.</p>

                <p>Between trade wars and armed conflicts across the world, there is talk of an impending economic downturn. And while we at the Institute for Family Studies (IFS) are not equipped to forecast an economic recession, we can document a recession that already has America in its grips:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/02/08/why-young-americans-having-less-sex-216953/">the sex recession</a>.</p>

<p>Americans are having a record low amount of sex. We find that in 1990, 55% of adults ages 18–64 reported having sex weekly, according to the&nbsp;<a href="https://gss.norc.org/">General Social Survey</a>&nbsp;(GSS). But around the turn of the millennium, that number began to dip: by 2010, less than half reported having sex weekly, and by 2024, of the more than 1,000 men and women queried on this topic by the GSS, that number had fallen to just 37 percent.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="" src="https://ifstudies.org/ifs-admin/resources/1-newsex-recession-trend-w640.png"></p>

<p>The sex recession has been&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/02/08/why-young-americans-having-less-sex-216953/">documented</a>&nbsp;previously, especially&nbsp;<a href="https://ifstudies.org/blog/sexless-america-young-adults-are-having-less-sex">here</a>&nbsp;at&nbsp;<a href="https://ifstudies.org/blog/is-the-sex-recession-over">IFS</a>. In 2016, Jean Twenge&nbsp;<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10508-017-0953-1?correlationId=4d9ea02c-da9a-44df-a279-bfae59b39531">found</a>&nbsp;that the decline is largely a cohort effect — younger generations are having less sex than their predecessors did. The causes? A decline in steady partnering, especially in marriage, and a decline in sexual frequency within couples.</p>

<p>Twenge’s findings largely hold true today. Between 2014 and 2024, the share of young adults, ages 18–29, who reported living with a partner, both married and unmarried, fell 10 percentage points, from 42% to 32%, according to the GSS. Because partnered adults have the most consistent sex, and more young men and women are flying solo, the share of young adults who are having regular sex keeps&nbsp;<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jomf.12723?casa_token=_qpkI5n3I4IAAAAA%3Aya7NHKX8gAGwIfk4oewEZFGFWzUmhu5LFVtB-yDlJTJjdY89xyB40xYgoXE9AVSPzbCsquFsEIQMPvs">falling</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>When it comes to sexlessness (“no sex in the last year”) among young adults, the biggest change comes post-2010. Prior and up to 2010, the share of young adults, ages 18-29, who reported not having sex held steady around 15 percent. But from 2010 to 2024, the share doubled, from 12% to 24% in the GSS.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="" src="https://ifstudies.org/ifs-admin/resources/2-sexlessness-among-ya-w640.png"></p>

<p>This “hockey-stick” shape resembles the pattern identified by Jonathon Haidt in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.anxiousgeneration.com/book"><em>The Anxious Generation</em></a>. In his book, Haidt calls the period of 2010 to 2015 the “Great Rewiring.” Adolescents going through puberty over this period were subject to all-pervasive digital media, kicked off by the smartphone proliferation of the late 2000s. Childhood became increasingly digital. Kids were not, consequently, exposed to nearly as much socialization as earlier generations. The digital media revolution left in its wake well documented increases in pathologies like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.deseret.com/2023/1/18/23558984/social-media-big-tobacco-teens-anxiety-depression-spencer-cox-utah/">anxiety</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10567-022-00404-5.pdf">depression</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9176070/">self-harm</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6278213/">suicide</a>.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="https://ifstudies.org/ifs-admin/resources/3-young-adults-socializing-w640.png"></p>

<p>The Great Rewiring of the early 2010s saw a rising generation of hermits. Notably, most of the decline in socialization actually happened&nbsp;<em>prior</em>&nbsp;to the pandemic. Between 2010 and 2019, the average time young adults spent with friends in a given week fell by nearly 50%, from 12.8 hours to just 6.5 hours. The pandemic pushed this number even lower, to 4.2 hours a week with friends. And while there has been a slight increase since, we seem to have found a new norm. Young adults spent just 5.1 hours with friends in a given week in 2024.</p>

<p>It's no surprise that this period is also marked by an increase in sexlessness. More time devoted to smart phones, social media, pornography, and gaming meant that young adults had fewer opportunities to develop the social skills needed to form relationships and spent less time in social settings—such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.derekthompson.org/p/the-death-of-partying-in-the-usaand">parties</a>—that would facilitate romantic relationships. The negative consequences of gaming may also&nbsp;<a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/711916?casa_token=FWu2y3G63hoAAAAA%3An1V6koGvDLMcL1gUMPx5zpgOdPhv-bYMHzjyFS2lhr1YQw6uktsc09tlWjXtiooj9dEilcRf9gI&amp;journalCode=jpe">extend</a>&nbsp;to young men’s declining participation in the workforce, which reduces their&nbsp;<a href="https://www.harpercollins.com/products/get-married-brad-wilcox?variant=41546330669090">appeal</a>&nbsp;on the mating market. Indeed, one recent&nbsp;<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jomf.12723?casa_token=_qpkI5n3I4IAAAAA%3Aya7NHKX8gAGwIfk4oewEZFGFWzUmhu5LFVtB-yDlJTJjdY89xyB40xYgoXE9AVSPzbCsquFsEIQMPvs">study</a>&nbsp;finds&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>the decline in the formation of romantic relationships and decreasing alcohol consumption are the most important [causes of falling young adult sex], but declining earnings and increasing use of computer games also play important roles.</em></p>

<p>This much is clear: young adults are spending less time dating, mating, and getting married, with obvious implications for sex. Indeed, the lack of marriage is why young adults face the brunt of the sex recession. The data tell us that married adults have markedly more sex than their unmarried peers: 46% of married men and women, ages 18-64, have weekly sex compared to about 34% of their unmarried peers.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="https://ifstudies.org/ifs-admin/resources/4-newmarried-unmarried-sex-w640.png"></p>

<p>While the decline in sex has been most acute among younger generations, older adults have not been left unscathed. And notably, the sex recession is making inroads among married couples. Between 1996 and 2008, 59% of married adults, ages 18-64, reported having sex once a week or more. That number fell to 49% for the period of 2010 to 2024. Married couples are seeing declines in sexual frequency across age groups.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="https://ifstudies.org/ifs-admin/resources/5-newmarried-couples-recession-w640.png"></p>

<p>It's no coincidence that a decline in marital sex follows the digital revolution. Today’s&nbsp;<a href="https://ifstudies.org/blog/where-have-all-the-good-men-gone">electronic opiates</a>&nbsp;not only depress partnering and marriage among young adults—they also weaken already established relationships. A&nbsp;<a href="https://ifstudies.org/report-brief/more-scrolling-more-marital-problems-less-sex-more-divorce-worries-for-couples-distracted-by-phones">2023 IFS study</a>&nbsp;found that married adults reported lower sexual frequency when their spouse substituted couple time for phone or computer use. Furthermore, bedtime procrastination is a rising habit. So-called bedtime procrastinators&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220314131918id_/https:/watermark.silverchair.com/zsz267.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAsUwggLBBgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggKyMIICrgIBADCCAqcGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMhbk3ySA7Nup6yLRJAgEQgIICeI9XvV7fwabDmJdZTI-jppMReXwqp0otgeSxJssNII3hfe-_MambEu0jYFqYid-N6gpvIqdEWl3mD0ubhPIifW_eQ9zlMK9haxZzWl1BWQ-QvLmk1Jx22kH44QPIn5yX0c2l40aAn6Mkg3m-H8oI-5wn3mLu0ZICofaUTAMI4SVdvHLJpHtQ9w4LKgtvcSUPqIhB0fpBU_5djCaBSxDXNQKMys6jpRjknjOacfKbQwEMjUhxA697XBg31zBMhUxopcZ2_ne0ImZLoAaup7paQEIoo3rap3oZ1-cMJ9ikMWOem6qmEeEfUu0PYLCyuvKnEnFFI4CKFEXSZ5fhrgShZMhiKlnrSroAyNTtkTKw6xbIbZs2ZeoZQn8TzJC_C-afBDRy1ylJJJQ8KsFhUAfz9rq8IJ_1M-mcLbPbPuf04kMig2MW6w5Bpd8TjCQ6m8cMsS5vNwhgGoVfA-tPExZOKoOms7Dw8JwekU316iB_cnJCvgj6nfEpcKs1A1-usB47wBGodqbhZ9XSsc7SJIbdKxG2F1tlKgsqvVgtfp5rLx_uriItg-zl1ubGsPZomf6OzPKtQSJuG3VmkqrNSnl4lOhT56_ay91WnpoHcuFrEyZme8sHKUaSGrpBWIxmgJr1EbLZE0Jn4iJGHhWwomMByuVWu_zvCt9KYLii66RT1ttmcOBekP-_6p35Ht29kUjDD57bH539gAY8eBdWV3ZtMicxEmgHDh2zEkw3VWMlYOvsqsmq4yIZvgqgesw85ipiXJPU04IxTHOg5qiP5LLIvqNI4RyeNydfH9by3ocjQH1sT6DYDEKirgzDrEqNnjNiXgJR0EsrONMN">spend two hours</a>&nbsp;using some form of digital media in the three hours leading up to sleep. It’s not surprising that more social media, Netflix, or gaming on the part of spouses translates to less intimacy.</p>

<p>The findings in this IFS research brief matter because regular sex is linked to&nbsp;<a href="https://compass.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1751-9004.2011.00408.x">better health</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.harpercollins.com/products/get-married-brad-wilcox?variant=41546330669090">higher quality marriages</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.harpercollins.com/products/get-married-brad-wilcox?variant=41546330669090">greater happiness</a>. We are, as Aristotle noted, social animals, real embodied creatures who flourish from real world interactions with others. And even though many of us are tempted nowadays to live out the lion’s share of our lives, including our sexual lives, in the virtual world, the truth is that we thrive when we have regular opportunities to spend time with other human beings,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.americansurveycenter.org/research/a-cultural-crossroads-americas-uncertain-future-amidst-enduring-discontent-and-rising-disconnection/?mkt_tok=NDc1LVBCUS05NzEAAAGbkvewKzlBksy5UkP8DK3ZgRteqCvUlLg6RRzvNoAw09KIInAbzFQuPQL0HeCMPUibHA3Fz92YAMuG_OzHJyBMDqSemLVT1DGE3tV34ZM32Jrf1cE">physically</a>. That’s why America should be just as concerned about the sex recession as any other.</p>

<p>But you didn't feel it. <em>You didn't feel it.</em></p>
<p>We, as people, feel something with every interaction. Frustration, joy, relief,
confidence. A feeling. A person interacts with our work. Our work evokes
a feeling. The feeling matters. The feeling is part of the work. The
<em>desired feeling</em> is part of the requirements.</p>
<p>When you feel it, you know. The feature makes you smile when you use it.
It fits right in, like it was always meant to be there. You want to
use it again. You want to tell people about it.</p>
<p>This is the difference. This is what metrics, specifications, and demos
miss. They don't capture the feeling. For the people who will use and live
in the work, the feeling is part of their daily experience. Which means
you can't stop at checking the boxes on paper. You have to sit with it,
use it, live with it.</p>
<p>You have to feel it.</p></div></div>]]></description>

This core is a heavyweight within the RISC-V scene, with wide out-of-order execution and a modern branch predictor and some new time based tricks. It’s in the same segment as high performance RISC-V designs like SiFive’s P870 and Veyron’s V1. Like those cores, Cuzco should stand head and shoulders above currently in-silicon RISC-V cores like Alibaba T-HEAD’s C910 and SiFive’s P550.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2an9!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1630238d-2ae4-4c37-b5d1-c1db7a6d865c_1279x716.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2an9!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1630238d-2ae4-4c37-b5d1-c1db7a6d865c_1279x716.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2an9!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1630238d-2ae4-4c37-b5d1-c1db7a6d865c_1279x716.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2an9!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1630238d-2ae4-4c37-b5d1-c1db7a6d865c_1279x716.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2an9!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1630238d-2ae4-4c37-b5d1-c1db7a6d865c_1279x716.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2an9!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1630238d-2ae4-4c37-b5d1-c1db7a6d865c_1279x716.png" width="1279" height="716" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1630238d-2ae4-4c37-b5d1-c1db7a6d865c_1279x716.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:716,&quot;width&quot;:1279,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2an9!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1630238d-2ae4-4c37-b5d1-c1db7a6d865c_1279x716.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2an9!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1630238d-2ae4-4c37-b5d1-c1db7a6d865c_1279x716.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2an9!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1630238d-2ae4-4c37-b5d1-c1db7a6d865c_1279x716.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2an9!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1630238d-2ae4-4c37-b5d1-c1db7a6d865c_1279x716.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Besides being a wide out-of-order design, Cuzco uses mostly static scheduling in the backend to save power and reduce complexity. Condor calls this a “time-based” scheduling scheme. I’ll cover more on this later, but it’s important to note that this is purely an implementation detail. It doesn’t require ISA modifications or special treatment from the compiler for optimal performance.</p><p>Cuzco is a 8-wide out-of-order core with a 256 entry ROB and clock speed targets around 2 GHz SS (Slow-Slow) to 2.5 GHz (Typical-Typical) on TSMC’s 5nm process. The pipeline has 12 stages counting from instruction fetch to data cache access completion. However, a 10 cycle mispredict penalty probably more accurately describes the core’s pipeline length relative to its competitors.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!IvR7!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe476ef8c-fe18-468d-9e25-cd478ea14d2f_1480x557.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!IvR7!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe476ef8c-fe18-468d-9e25-cd478ea14d2f_1480x557.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!IvR7!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe476ef8c-fe18-468d-9e25-cd478ea14d2f_1480x557.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!IvR7!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe476ef8c-fe18-468d-9e25-cd478ea14d2f_1480x557.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!IvR7!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe476ef8c-fe18-468d-9e25-cd478ea14d2f_1480x557.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!IvR7!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe476ef8c-fe18-468d-9e25-cd478ea14d2f_1480x557.png" width="1456" height="548" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e476ef8c-fe18-468d-9e25-cd478ea14d2f_1480x557.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:548,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!IvR7!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe476ef8c-fe18-468d-9e25-cd478ea14d2f_1480x557.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!IvR7!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe476ef8c-fe18-468d-9e25-cd478ea14d2f_1480x557.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!IvR7!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe476ef8c-fe18-468d-9e25-cd478ea14d2f_1480x557.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!IvR7!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe476ef8c-fe18-468d-9e25-cd478ea14d2f_1480x557.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>As a licensed core, Cuzco is meant to be highly configurable to widen its target market. The core is built from a variable number of execution slices. Customization options also include L2 TLB size, off-cluster bus widths, and L2/L3 capacity. Condor can also adjust the size of various internal core structures to meet customer performance requirements. Cuzco cores are arranged into clusters with up to eight cores. Clusters interface with the system via a CHI bus, so customers can bring their own network-on-chip (NoC) to hit higher core counts via multi-cluster setups.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!AW4y!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F16a84802-4a32-42fd-bf89-6e75ce5d3914_1600x904.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!AW4y!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F16a84802-4a32-42fd-bf89-6e75ce5d3914_1600x904.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!AW4y!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F16a84802-4a32-42fd-bf89-6e75ce5d3914_1600x904.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!AW4y!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F16a84802-4a32-42fd-bf89-6e75ce5d3914_1600x904.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!AW4y!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F16a84802-4a32-42fd-bf89-6e75ce5d3914_1600x904.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!AW4y!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F16a84802-4a32-42fd-bf89-6e75ce5d3914_1600x904.png" width="1456" height="823" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/16a84802-4a32-42fd-bf89-6e75ce5d3914_1600x904.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:823,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!AW4y!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F16a84802-4a32-42fd-bf89-6e75ce5d3914_1600x904.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!AW4y!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F16a84802-4a32-42fd-bf89-6e75ce5d3914_1600x904.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!AW4y!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F16a84802-4a32-42fd-bf89-6e75ce5d3914_1600x904.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!AW4y!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F16a84802-4a32-42fd-bf89-6e75ce5d3914_1600x904.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Cuzco’s frontend starts with a sophisticated branch predictor, as is typical for modern cores targeting any reasonable performance level. Conditional branches are handled via a TAGE-SC-L predictor. TAGE stands for Tagged Geometric, a technique that uses multiple tables each handling a different history length. It seeks to efficiently use branch predictor storage by selecting the most appropriate history length for each branch, as opposed to older techniques that use a fixed history length. The SC (Statistical Corrector) part handles the small subset of branches where TAGE doesn’t work well, and can invert the prediction if it sees TAGE often getting things wrong under certain circumstances. Finally, L indicates a loop predictor. A loop predictor is simply a set of counters that come into play for branches that are taken a certain number of times, then not taken once. If the branch predictor detects such loop behavior, the loop predictor can let it avoid mispredicting on the last iteration of the loop. Basically, TAGE-SC-L is an augmented version of the basic TAGE predictor.</p><p>AMD’s Zen 2, Ampere’s AmpereOne, and Qualcomm’s Oryon also use TAGE predictors of some sort, and achieve excellent branch prediction accuracy. AMD, Ampere, and Qualcomm also likely augment the basic TAGE prediction strategy in some way. How Cuzco’s TAGE predictor performs will depend on how large its history tables are, as well as how well the predictor is tuned (selection of index vs tag bits, history lengths, distribution of storage budget across TAGE tables, etc). For Cuzco’s part, they’ve disclosed that the TAGE predictor’s base component uses a 16K entry table of bimodal counters.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!olX5!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3c6d8dfa-88d8-4eef-a550-95b009e18aa9_1600x897.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!olX5!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3c6d8dfa-88d8-4eef-a550-95b009e18aa9_1600x897.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!olX5!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3c6d8dfa-88d8-4eef-a550-95b009e18aa9_1600x897.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!olX5!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3c6d8dfa-88d8-4eef-a550-95b009e18aa9_1600x897.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!olX5!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3c6d8dfa-88d8-4eef-a550-95b009e18aa9_1600x897.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!olX5!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3c6d8dfa-88d8-4eef-a550-95b009e18aa9_1600x897.png" width="1456" height="816" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3c6d8dfa-88d8-4eef-a550-95b009e18aa9_1600x897.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:816,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!olX5!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3c6d8dfa-88d8-4eef-a550-95b009e18aa9_1600x897.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!olX5!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3c6d8dfa-88d8-4eef-a550-95b009e18aa9_1600x897.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!olX5!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3c6d8dfa-88d8-4eef-a550-95b009e18aa9_1600x897.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!olX5!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3c6d8dfa-88d8-4eef-a550-95b009e18aa9_1600x897.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Branch target caching on Cuzco is provided by a 8K entry branch target buffer (BTB) split into two levels. Condor’s slides show the BTB hit/miss occurring on the cycle after instruction cache access starts, so a taken branch likely creates a single pipeline bubble. Returns are predicted using a 32 entry return stack. Cuzco also has an indirect branch predictor, which is typical on modern CPUs.</p><p>Cuzco’s instruction fetch logic feeds from a 64 KB 8-way set associative instruction cache, and speeds up address translations with a 64 entry fully associative TLB. The instruction fetch stages pull an entire 64B cacheline into the ICQ (instruction cache queue), and then pull instructions from that into an instruction queue (XIQ). The decoders feed from the XIQ, and can handle up to eight instructions per cycle.</p><p>Much of the action in Condor’s presentation relates to the rename and allocate stage, which acts as a bridge between the frontend and out-of-order backend. In most out-of-order cores, the renamer carries out register renaming and allocates resources in the backend. Then, the backend dynamically schedules instructions as their dependencies become available. Cuzco’s renamer goes a step further and predicts instruction schedules as well.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LtQn!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F26690f6d-e03a-4cb5-9c3e-f37765879dca_1600x898.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LtQn!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F26690f6d-e03a-4cb5-9c3e-f37765879dca_1600x898.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LtQn!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F26690f6d-e03a-4cb5-9c3e-f37765879dca_1600x898.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LtQn!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F26690f6d-e03a-4cb5-9c3e-f37765879dca_1600x898.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LtQn!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F26690f6d-e03a-4cb5-9c3e-f37765879dca_1600x898.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LtQn!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F26690f6d-e03a-4cb5-9c3e-f37765879dca_1600x898.png" width="1456" height="817" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/26690f6d-e03a-4cb5-9c3e-f37765879dca_1600x898.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:817,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LtQn!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F26690f6d-e03a-4cb5-9c3e-f37765879dca_1600x898.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LtQn!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F26690f6d-e03a-4cb5-9c3e-f37765879dca_1600x898.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LtQn!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F26690f6d-e03a-4cb5-9c3e-f37765879dca_1600x898.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LtQn!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F26690f6d-e03a-4cb5-9c3e-f37765879dca_1600x898.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>One parallel to this is Nvidia’s static scheduling in Kepler and subsequent GPU architectures. Both simplify scheduling by telling an instruction to execute a certain number of cycles in the future, rather than having hardware dynamically check for dependencies. But Nvidia does this in their compiler because GPU ISAs aren’t standardized. Cuzco still uses hardware to create dynamic schedules, but moves that job into the rename/allocate stage rather than the schedulers in the backend. Schedulers can be expensive structures in conventional out-of-order CPUs, because they have to check whether instructions are ready to execute every cycle. On Cuzco, the backend schedulers can simply wait a specified number of cycles, and then issue an instruction knowing the dependencies will be ready by then.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-1Pi!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F29ef4401-9d22-4005-af0b-205294710e18_1600x904.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-1Pi!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F29ef4401-9d22-4005-af0b-205294710e18_1600x904.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-1Pi!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F29ef4401-9d22-4005-af0b-205294710e18_1600x904.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-1Pi!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F29ef4401-9d22-4005-af0b-205294710e18_1600x904.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-1Pi!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F29ef4401-9d22-4005-af0b-205294710e18_1600x904.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-1Pi!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F29ef4401-9d22-4005-af0b-205294710e18_1600x904.png" width="1456" height="823" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/29ef4401-9d22-4005-af0b-205294710e18_1600x904.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:823,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-1Pi!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F29ef4401-9d22-4005-af0b-205294710e18_1600x904.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-1Pi!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F29ef4401-9d22-4005-af0b-205294710e18_1600x904.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-1Pi!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F29ef4401-9d22-4005-af0b-205294710e18_1600x904.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-1Pi!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F29ef4401-9d22-4005-af0b-205294710e18_1600x904.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>To carry out time-based scheduling, Cuzco maintains a Time Resource Matrix (TRM), which tracks utilization of various resources like execution ports, functional units, and data buses for a certain number of cycles in the future. The TRM can look 256 cycles into the future, which keeps storage requirements under control. Because searching a 256 row matrix in hardware would be extremely expensive, Cuzco only looks for available resources in a small window after an instruction’s dependencies are predicted to be ready. Condor found searching a window of eight cycles provided a good tradeoff. Because the renamer can handle up to eight instructions, it at most has to access 64 rows in the TRM per cycle. If the renamer can’t find free resources in the search window, the instruction will be stalled at the ID2 stage.</p><p>Another potential limitation is the TRM size, which could be a limitation for long latency instructions. However, the longest latency instructions tend to be loads that miss cache. Cuzco always assumes a L1D hit for TRM scheduling, and uses replay to handle L1D misses. That means stalls at ID2 from TRM size limitations should also be rare.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!WZiL!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde934736-2aec-481d-b1a7-2e721ad25860_1600x898.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!WZiL!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde934736-2aec-481d-b1a7-2e721ad25860_1600x898.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!WZiL!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde934736-2aec-481d-b1a7-2e721ad25860_1600x898.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!WZiL!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde934736-2aec-481d-b1a7-2e721ad25860_1600x898.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!WZiL!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde934736-2aec-481d-b1a7-2e721ad25860_1600x898.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!WZiL!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde934736-2aec-481d-b1a7-2e721ad25860_1600x898.png" width="1456" height="817" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/de934736-2aec-481d-b1a7-2e721ad25860_1600x898.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:817,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!WZiL!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde934736-2aec-481d-b1a7-2e721ad25860_1600x898.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!WZiL!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde934736-2aec-481d-b1a7-2e721ad25860_1600x898.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!WZiL!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde934736-2aec-481d-b1a7-2e721ad25860_1600x898.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!WZiL!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde934736-2aec-481d-b1a7-2e721ad25860_1600x898.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Compared to a hypothetical “greedy” setup, where the core is able to create a perfect schedule with execution resource limitations in mind, limiting the TRM search window decreases performance by a few percent. Condor notes that creating a core to match the “greedy” figure may not even be possible. A conventional out-of-order core wouldn’t have TRM-related restrictions, but may face difficulties creating an optimal schedule for other reasons. For example, a distributed scheduler may have several micro-ops become ready in one scheduling queue, and face “false” delays even though free execution units may be available on other scheduling queues.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8gUV!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff26a1969-520c-4798-95e9-799e1905ee7a_1600x884.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8gUV!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff26a1969-520c-4798-95e9-799e1905ee7a_1600x884.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8gUV!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff26a1969-520c-4798-95e9-799e1905ee7a_1600x884.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8gUV!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff26a1969-520c-4798-95e9-799e1905ee7a_1600x884.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8gUV!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff26a1969-520c-4798-95e9-799e1905ee7a_1600x884.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8gUV!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff26a1969-520c-4798-95e9-799e1905ee7a_1600x884.png" width="1456" height="804" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f26a1969-520c-4798-95e9-799e1905ee7a_1600x884.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:804,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8gUV!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff26a1969-520c-4798-95e9-799e1905ee7a_1600x884.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8gUV!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff26a1969-520c-4798-95e9-799e1905ee7a_1600x884.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8gUV!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff26a1969-520c-4798-95e9-799e1905ee7a_1600x884.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8gUV!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff26a1969-520c-4798-95e9-799e1905ee7a_1600x884.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Static scheduling only works when instruction latencies are known ahead of time. Some instructions have variable latency, like loads that can miss caches or TLBs, encounter bank conflicts, or require store forwarding. As mentioned before, Cuzco uses instruction replay to handle variable latency instructions and the associated dynamic behavior. The renamer does take some measures to reduce replays, like checking to see if a load gets its address from the same register as a prior store. However, it doesn’t attempt to predict memory dependencies like Intel’s Core 2, and also doesn’t try to predict whether a load will miss cache.</p><p>Out of order execution in Cuzco is relatively simple, because the rename/allocate stage takes care of figuring out when instructions will execute. Each instruction is simply held within the schedulers until a specified number of cycles pass, after which it’s sent for execution. If the rename/allocate stage guesses wrong, replay gets handled via “poison” bits. The erroneously executed instruction’s result data is effectively marked as poisoned, and any instructions consuming that data will get re-executed. Replaying instructions costs power and wastes execution throughput, so replays should ideally be a rare event. 70.07 replays per 1000 instructions feels like a bit of a high figure, but likely isn’t a major problem because execution resources are rarely a limitation in an out-of-order core. Taking about 7% more execution resources may be an acceptable tradeoff, considering most modern chips rarely use their core width in a sustained fashion.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!KFlE!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b115df6-d801-4dbf-be59-52a3645970de_1600x885.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!KFlE!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b115df6-d801-4dbf-be59-52a3645970de_1600x885.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!KFlE!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b115df6-d801-4dbf-be59-52a3645970de_1600x885.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!KFlE!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b115df6-d801-4dbf-be59-52a3645970de_1600x885.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!KFlE!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b115df6-d801-4dbf-be59-52a3645970de_1600x885.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!KFlE!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b115df6-d801-4dbf-be59-52a3645970de_1600x885.png" width="1456" height="805" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/6b115df6-d801-4dbf-be59-52a3645970de_1600x885.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:805,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!KFlE!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b115df6-d801-4dbf-be59-52a3645970de_1600x885.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!KFlE!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b115df6-d801-4dbf-be59-52a3645970de_1600x885.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!KFlE!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b115df6-d801-4dbf-be59-52a3645970de_1600x885.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!KFlE!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b115df6-d801-4dbf-be59-52a3645970de_1600x885.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Execution resources are grouped into slices, each of which have a pair of pipelines. A slice can execute all of the core’s supported RISC-V instructions, making it easy to scale execution resources by changing slice count. Each slice consists of a set of execution queues (XEQs), which hold micro-ops waiting for a functional unit. Cuzco has XEQs per functional unit, unlike conventional designs that tend to have a scheduling queue that feeds all functional units attached to an execution port. Four register read ports supply operands to the slice, and two write ports handle result writeback. Bus conflicts are handled by the TRM as well. A slice cannot execute more than two micro-ops per cycle, even doing so would not oversubscribe the register read ports. For example, a slice can’t issue an integer add, a branch, and a load in the same cycle even though that would only require four register inputs.</p><p>XEQs are sized to match workload characteristics, much like tuning a distributed scheduler. While XEQ sizes can be set to match customer requirements, Condor was able to give some figures for a baseline configuration. ALUs get 16 entry queues, while branches and address generation units (LS) get 8 entry queues. XEQ sizes are adjustable in powers of two, from 2 to 32 entries. There’s generally a single cycle of latency for forwarding between slices. The core can be configured to do zero cycle cross-slice forwarding, but that would be quite difficult to pull off.</p><p>On the vector side, Cuzco supports 256/512-bit VLENs via multiple micro-ops, which are distributed across the execution slices. Execution units are natively 64 bits wide. There’s one FMA unit per slice, so peak FP32 throughput is eight FMA operations per cycle, or 16 FLOPS when counting the add and multiply as separate operations. FP adds execute with 2 cycle latency, while FP multiplies and multiply-adds have four cycle latency. The two cycle FP add latency is nice to see, and matches recent cores like Neoverse N1 and Intel’s Golden Cove, albeit at much lower clocks.</p><p>Cuzco’s load/store unit has a 64 entry load queue, a 64 entry store queue, and a 64 entry queue for data cache misses. Loads can leave the load queue after accessing the data cache, likely creating behavior similar to AMD’s Zen series where the out-of-order backend can have far more loads pending retirement than the documented load queue capacity would suggest. The core has four load/store pipelines in a four slice configuration, or one pipeline per slice. Maximum load bandwidth is 64B/cycle, achievable with vector loads.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!y8PV!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff84018c0-8784-4e0c-9d51-8e29681da1f3_1165x404.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!y8PV!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff84018c0-8784-4e0c-9d51-8e29681da1f3_1165x404.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!y8PV!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff84018c0-8784-4e0c-9d51-8e29681da1f3_1165x404.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!y8PV!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff84018c0-8784-4e0c-9d51-8e29681da1f3_1165x404.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!y8PV!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff84018c0-8784-4e0c-9d51-8e29681da1f3_1165x404.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!y8PV!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff84018c0-8784-4e0c-9d51-8e29681da1f3_1165x404.png" width="1165" height="404" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f84018c0-8784-4e0c-9d51-8e29681da1f3_1165x404.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:404,&quot;width&quot;:1165,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:76406,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://chipsandcheese.com/i/172284931?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff84018c0-8784-4e0c-9d51-8e29681da1f3_1165x404.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!y8PV!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff84018c0-8784-4e0c-9d51-8e29681da1f3_1165x404.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!y8PV!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff84018c0-8784-4e0c-9d51-8e29681da1f3_1165x404.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!y8PV!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff84018c0-8784-4e0c-9d51-8e29681da1f3_1165x404.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!y8PV!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff84018c0-8784-4e0c-9d51-8e29681da1f3_1165x404.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>The L1D is physically indexed and physically addressed (PIPT), so address translation has to complete before L1D access.To speed up address translation, Cuzco has a 64 entry fully associative data TLB.

Thus a L3 hit would cause a consuming instruction to be executed three times - once for the predicted L1D hit, once for the predicted L2 hit, and a final time for the L3 hit with the correct data.</p><p>High performance CPU design has settled down over the past couple decades, and converged on an out-of-order execution model. There’s no denying that out-of-order execution is difficult. Numerous alternatives have been tried through the years but didn’t have staying power. Intel’s Itanium sought to use an ISA-based approach, but failed to unseat the company’s own x86 cores that used out-of-order execution. Nvidia’s Denver tried to dynamically compile ARM instructions into microcode bundles, but that approach was not carried forward. All successful high performance designs today generally use the same out-of-order execution strategy, albeit with plenty of variation. That’s driven by the requirements of ISA compatibility, and the need to deliver high single threaded performance across a broad range of applications. Breaking from the mould is obviously fraught with peril.</p><p>Condor seeks to break from the mould, but does so deep in the core in a way that should be invisible to software a functional perspective, and mostly invisible from a performance perspective. The core runs RISC-V instructions and thus benefits from that software ecosystem, unlike Itanium. It doesn’t rely on a compiled microcode cache like Denver, so it doesn’t end up running in a degraded performance beyond what a typical OoO core would see when dealing with poor code locality. Finally, instruction replay effectively creates dynamic schedules and handles cache misses</p><p><span>If you like the content then consider heading over to the </span><a href="https://www.patreon.com/ChipsandCheese" rel="">Patreon</a><span> or </span><a href="https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=4EMPH66SBGVSQ" rel="">PayPal</a><span> if you want to toss a few bucks to Chips and Cheese.
